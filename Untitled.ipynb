       "  \" during the relevant period, respondent was aware or should have been aware that certain trades it executed on behalf of the gib's non-discretionary customers, including as part of bunched orders, were not specifically authorized by the customers. for example, in july 2014, respondent conducted an audit of the gib. during that audit, respondent noted that on multiple occasions that the gib did not appear to be properly timestamping the trade tickets for certain bunched orders. in particular, the initial timestamps on certain trade tickets, which evidenced when the gib purportedly contacted a non-discretionary customer to obtain their specific authorization for the trade, appeared to match the exact same timestamp that the gib supposedly submitted these trades to respondent for execution. this raised a red flag for respondent that the gib was not obtaining specific customer authorizations. notwithstanding this red flag, respondent continued to accept orders from the gib for which the gib failed to obtain the requisite customer authorizations.\",\n",
       "  ' similarly, in october 2014, the gib informed respondent that the gib did not obtain from its customers specific authorization when it canceled and replaced orders on behalf of those customers. this again raised a red flag for respondent that the gib was not obtaining specific customer authorizations. subsequently in 2014, the gib accounts relevant here were transferred to a different fcm.',\n",

       "  \" thus, respondent here had an obligation to monitor the post-execution allocation process for unusual or suspicious activityparticularly after respondent had knowledge of red flags including that the gib was not obtaining specific customer authorizations for certain of the bunched order transactions. notwithstanding these obligations, however, with respect to orders placed by its gib, respondent employees and agents routinely: (1) executed bunched orders that contained trades for the gib's proprietary and gib's customer accounts; (2) executed bunched orders that contained trades for the gib's discretionary and non-discretionary customer accounts; and (3) executed orders for the gib's non-discretionary customers, including bunched orders, when the gib had failed to obtain specific customer authorization for the transaction. as noted, this occurred even after respondent had identified that the gib's orders were not compliant with the act and regulations. in failing to supervise its employees and agents to ensure they carried out these obligations in their handling of the commodity interest accounts, respondent violated regulation 166.3.\",\n",
