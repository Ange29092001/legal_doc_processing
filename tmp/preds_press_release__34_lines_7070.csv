The Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section reached this resolution based on a number of factors, including the fact that Embraer did not voluntarily disclose the FCPA violations, but did cooperate with the department's investigation after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) served it with a subpoena.
The Fraud Section appreciates the cooperation and assistance provided by the SEC in this matter.
As a result, the criminal penalty in this case is 20 percent below the bottom of the applicable range under the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines, a discount that reflects Embraerâs full cooperation but incomplete remediation.
After Embraer began cooperating, it did so fully and disclosed all relevant, non-privileged facts known to it, including about individuals involved in the misconduct.

Ralph Lauren Corporation's cooperation saved the agency substantial time and resources ordinarily consumed in investigations of comparable conduct.
The SEC has determined not to charge Ralph Lauren Corporation with violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) due to the company's prompt reporting of the violations on its own initiative, the completeness of the information it provided, and its extensive, thorough, and real-time cooperation with the SEC's investigation.

The misconduct came to light as a result of the company adopting measures to improve its worldwide internal controls and compliance efforts, including implementation of an FCPA compliance training program in Argentina.
According to the NPA, the bribes occurred during a period when Ralph Lauren Corporation lacked meaningful anti-corruption compliance and control mechanisms over its Argentine subsidiary.
Kara Brockmeyer, the SEC's FCPA Unit Chief, added, ""This NPA shows the benefit of implementing an effective compliance program.
The SEC took into account the significant remedial measures undertaken by Ralph Lauren Corporation, including a comprehensive new compliance program throughout its operations.
Among Ralph Lauren Corporation's remedial measures have been new compliance training, termination of employment and business arrangements with all individuals involved in the wrongdoing, and strengthening its internal controls and its procedures for third party due diligence.
Ralph Lauren Corporation also conducted a risk assessment of its major operations worldwide to identify any other compliance problems."
