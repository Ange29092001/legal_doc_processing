There is 3 main modules in legal-doc-processing : 
- legal_doc for LegalDoc objects ie order, complaint, etc etc official documents
- press_release for PressRelease objects for legal press release related to each case
- decision for both LegalDoc and PressRelease documents. The Decision object is able to read both, make prediction from both documents and merge/clean prediction of both documents. If just one of them, the object will apply basic method based on LegalDoc or PressRelease object

so you can :
```
from legal_doc_processing import *  # import all
from legal_doc_processing import legal_doc # import legal document module
from legal_doc_processing import press_release # import press release module
from legal_doc_processing import decision # import decision module
```
<br>

### Instanciation
youn can init an object in 2 ways.
* with text directly
```
from legal_doc_processing import ld
doc = ld.LegalDoc("this is a document")
# or better
doc = ld.from_text("this is a document")
```
* with path to a file
```
doc = ld.from_file("this/is/my/file.txt")
```

for press release, same pattern: 
```
from legal_doc_processing import pr
press = ld.PressRelease("this is a press release")
press = ld.from_text("this is a press release")
```
* with path to a file
```
press = ld.from_file("this/is/my/file.txt")
```

once instanciated, you can print : 
```
print(doc)
```
<br>

all interessing features are in feature_dict attribute
```
print(doc.feature_dict)
```
<br>

### Predictions

you can now make predictions : 
```
defendant = doc.predict("defendant")
print(defendant)
case = doc.predict("case")
print(case)
```
<br>

predict method return a something but alson work on the object itself : 
```
print(doc)
print(doc.feature_dict)
```
<br>

of course most easy is to predict all : 
```
features = doc.predict("all")
print(features)
print(doc)
```
<br>

you can acces to final predictions or detailed prediction: 
```
print(doc.feature_dict) # just the results
print(doc._feature_dict) # results + score for each result
```
