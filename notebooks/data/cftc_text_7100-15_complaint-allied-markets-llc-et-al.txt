COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, 

CIVIL MONETARY PENALTY, AND OTHER EQUITABLE RELIE.F 


Plaintiff United States Commodity Futures Trading Corn.m ission ("CFTC") alleges as 

follows: 

I. 

SU MMARY 

l . 

Beg inn ing as ea rly as January 20 12, Joshua Gilliland and Chawali t 

Wongkhiao, indiv idua lly and  as principals of A llied Markets LLC ("A ll ied Markets") 

(collectively "Defendants"), have engaged  in a  frau du lent scheme to solicit more than $I 

mill ion from members o f' che public to paJticipate in  a supposed commodity pool purportedly 

trading leveraged or margined retail  off-exchange foreign currency contracts, commonly 

known as "forex." 

2. 

As part of this illegal scheme  Defendants  misappropriated pool participants' 

funds to pay Gill iland 's and Wongk:hiao 's personal expenses.  Gill iland and Wongkhiao 

treated pool participants' funds as their personal bank account, spending pool participants' 

money on restaurants, en tertainment, and living expenses. 

3. 

Defendants made material misrepresentations regarding  their trading expertise 

and profits, and they  fa iled to disclose to prospective and existing pool participants that only 

a small  portion of their funds would be used to  trade  forex, while the rest would  be 

misappropriated  to  pay Gilliland' s a nd  Wongkhiao 's persona l expenses and to fi.irthcr 

Defendants'  fraudu lent scheme. 

4. 

Defendants, who have never been registered as required wilh lhe CFTC,  lured 

their victims  into sending them funds  for their purported commodity pool by fraudulently 

guaranteeing speci fic trading returns and by  representing that Defendants'  frwe:x  tradi ng was 

generating l.arge profits.  At Defendants' direction, pool participants deposited more than 

$ I  million into bank accounts controlled by Defendants.  When Defendants paid what they 

claimed to  be trading profits to  pool participants or supposedly returned pool participants' 

principal, they did so using money paid by other pool particjpants. in che  manner of a Ponzi 

scheme. 

5. 

By virtue of this conduct, and as more fully set forth  below, Defendants have 

engaged, are engaging, and/or are about to engage in acts and practices in  violation of 

Sections 2(c)(2)(C)(iii)(l)(cc), 4b(a)(2)(A) and (C), 4k(2), 4m(l), and 4o(l) of the 

Commodity Exchange Act ('"CEA"), 7  U.S.C. §§ 2(c)(2)(C)(i ii)(l)(cc), 6b(a)(2)(A), (C),

V. 

FACTS 

18. 

The Relevant Period for this Complaint is January 2012 through  the present. 

] 9. 

Dm·ing the Relevant Period, All ied Markets, by and through Gi ll iland and 

Wongk:hiao, solicited members of the public, by use of the mails and/or other means or 

instrumentalities of interstate. commerce, to send money to bank accounts under Defendants ' 

5 


control  for the purpose of trading agreements, contracts, or transactions  in forcx (foreign 

currency, offered  to  persons who were not eligible contract participants, and  offered, or 

entered into,  on a leveraged or margined basis)  in a pm-ported commodity pool  operated by 

Allied Markets. 

20. 

By  undertaking these solicitations and  accepting,  funds  for a commodity pool , 

Allied Markets, by and through Gilliland and  Wongkhiao, acted as a CPO. 

2 I. 

Through their actions on  behalf of Alli ed Markets, Gi llil and and Wongkhiao 

acted as associated persons of Allied Markets. the CPO. 

22. 

Neither Allied Markets, Gill.iland, nor Wongkhiao has ever been registered 

with the CFTC in any capacity. 

23. 

At least $1  million was deposited  in  accounts under Defendants'  control for 

the purpose of trading forex.  in  a purported commodity pool operated by All ied Markets. 

24. 

OuJing the Relevant Period, at least one pool  participant did not qualify as an 

"eligible contract participant," as that term  is defined  by Section  I a( 18) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 

§ 1a(l8) (2012).  ln  additi on~ the purported commod ity pool operated by Allied Markets was 

not an eligible contract participant during the Relevant Period. 

25. 

On numerous occasions during the Relevant Period, including in or about June 

2012 and in or about July 20 l 3, Defendants fraudulently represented to at least four 

prospective pool participants that Allied Markets'  forex trading offered a safe investment 

with guaranteed  returns, which pool pm-Licipants  were due to receive on a 111011thly or annual 

basis. 

6 


26. 

Defendants knew these representations were false because, among  other 

things, Defendants knew that the purported commodity pool  opeJ"ated  by Al lied Markets, by 

and  througb Gilliland and Wongkhiao, sustai ned overall net losses in  its forex trading 

account during the Relevant Period. 

27. 

Gil liland and Wongkhiao, acting 011  behalf of Allied  Markets_. dfrected at least 

two pool participants to sign agreements with Allied Markets containing fraudu lent 

representations.  Tbese agreements guaranteed rates of return on pool participants'  principal 

of seven and ten percent, respectively.  The agreements also provided that pool pmticipants 

could tenninate their agreement with Allied Markets and that their principal would be 

refunded upon sixty days1  notice.  Wongkhiao signed the agreements as a "Managing 

Member" of All ied Markets. 

28.  While the agreements Allied  Markets executed with pool  participants referred 

to investment returns as 1'interest," Defendants commun icated to p ool participants that their 

funds were to be pooled for trading in forex. and that returns would be derived from  trad ing 

profits.  At least one agre~ment Allied Markets executed with a  pool participant expr~ssly 

stated that the pool would trade forex. 

29. 

During the Relevant Period, Defendants'  representations prompted pool 

participants to provide Defendants at least $1  million for trading forex in the purported 

commodity pool operated by A llied Markets.  Defendants m.isappropriated this money. 

30. 

Defendants directed pool participants to send fonds to bank accounts under 

their contm l.  In operating these bank accounts and accepting f'unds  from  pool  participants, 

Defendants made no distinction between the purported commodity pool operated by All ied 

7 


Markets and Allied Markets as the CPO, and they comm ing'led their p~rsonal funds with 


funds  contributed by pool participants. 


31. 

Gilliland and Wongkhiao, acting on behalf of Allied Markets, established a 

forex trading account in the name of, and for the benefit of, Allied Markets, not for the 

purp01ied commodity pool operated by A llied Markets. 

32. 

During the Relevant Period, the forex  trading conducted by GiJiiland and/or 

Wongkhiao resu lted in a net loss of approximately $ 190,000. 

33. 

Defendants did  not disclose these losses to poo l participants.  Rather, 

Defendants knowingly misrepresented to pool participants on multiple occasions during the 

Relevant Period, in person and via telepbone, that Defendants ' forex trading was profitable. 

34.  While Defendants initially deposited some ofthe f1mds they received  from 

pool participants into the Allied Markets forex trading account, Defendants used only a small 

portion of those funds for trading. 

35. 

Instead of trading forex as promised , dming the Relevant Period Defendants 

withdrew approximateJy $850, 000 in pool partidpant funds from the All ied Markets forex 

trading account. 

36. 

Us ing pool participants'  funds , Gilliland and Wongkhiao spent approximately 

$64~000 on  restaurants and entertainment, approximately $33,000 on travel , hotels, and  rental 

cars, and approximately $66,000 on rent for the ir residence in Jacksonville Beach , Florida. 

37. 

During the Relevanl Period, Gilliland and  Wongkhiao also transferred at least 

$83,200 to their personal bank accounts, withdrew approximately$ l 05 ,000 in cash from 

automated teller machines, and withdrew approximately $34,000 in cash at bank branches. 

8 


38. 

Defendants also us¥d pool participant fonds to pay purported profits, to pay 

other personal expenses, and to  further their fraudt1Jent scheme.  Defendants fai l'ed  to 

disclose to pool participants that Defendants did not invest all  pool participant funds as 

promjsecl. 

39. 

During the Relevant Period,  Defendants distributed approximately $48, I69 in 

purported gains to pool participants.  Defe11dauts  represented that these payments came from 

trading profits.  Contrary lo their representations, Defendants made these payments from  the 

deposits of other pool participants, in the mannei- of a Ponzi sche me. 

40.. 

Unless restrained and enjoined QY  this Court>Defendants are  likely to 

continue to engage in the acts and practices alleged in this Complaint and similar acts and 

practices in violation of the CEA and CFTC Regulations.

U.S. COMMODITY FUTURES 
TRADING COMMISSION, 

Plaintiff, 

ALLIED MARKETS LLC, 
JOSHUA GILLILAND, and 
CHAWALIT  WONG KHJA O, 

Defendants. 

COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, 

CIVIL MONETARY PENALTY, AND OTHER EQUITABLE RELIE.F 


Plaintiff United States Commodity Futures Trading Corn.m ission ("CFTC") alleges as 

follows: 

I. 

SU MMARY 

l . 

Beg inn ing as ea rly as January 20 12, Joshua Gilliland and Chawali t 

Wongkhiao, indiv idua lly and  as principals of A llied Markets LLC ("A ll ied Markets") 

(collectively "Defendants"), have engaged  in a  frau du lent scheme to solicit more than $I 

mill ion from members o f' che public to paJticipate in  a supposed commodity pool purportedly 

trading leveraged or margined retail  off-exchange foreign currency contracts, commonly 

known as "forex." 

2. 

As part of this illegal scheme  Defendants  misappropriated pool participants' 

funds to pay Gill iland 's and Wongk:hiao 's personal expenses.  Gill iland and Wongkhiao 

treated pool participants' funds as their personal bank account, spending pool participants' 

money on restaurants, en tertainment, and living expenses. 

3. 

Defendants made material misrepresentations regarding  their trading expertise 

and profits, and they  fa iled to disclose to prospective and existing pool participants that only 

a small  portion of their funds would be used to  trade  forex, while the rest would  be 

misappropriated  to  pay Gilliland' s a nd  Wongkhiao 's persona l expenses and to fi.irthcr 

Defendants'  fraudu lent scheme. 

4. 

Defendants, who have never been registered as required wilh lhe CFTC,  lured 

their victims  into sending them funds  for their purported commodity pool by fraudulently 

guaranteeing speci fic trading returns and by  representing that Defendants'  frwe:x  tradi ng was 

generating l.arge profits.  At Defendants' direction, pool participants deposited more than 

$ I  million into bank accounts controlled by Defendants.  When Defendants paid what they 

claimed to  be trading profits to  pool participants or supposedly returned pool participants' 

principal, they did so using money paid by other pool particjpants. in che  manner of a Ponzi 

scheme. 

5. 

By virtue of this conduct, and as more fully set forth  below, Defendants have 

engaged, are engaging, and/or are about to engage in acts and practices in  violation of 

Sections 2(c)(2)(C)(iii)(l)(cc), 4b(a)(2)(A) and (C), 4k(2), 4m(l), and 4o(l) of the 

Commodity Exchange Act ('"CEA"), 7  U.S.C. §§ 2(c)(2)(C)(i ii)(l)(cc), 6b(a)(2)(A), (C), 

6k(2), 6m(l), 6o( I) (2012); and CFT C Regul ations 3. 12,4.20(a)-(c), 4.4 1(a), 5.2(b)(1) and 

(3), 5.3(a)(2)(i), and 5.3(a)(2)(ii). 17 C.F.R. §§  3. 12, 4.20(a)-(c), 4.41 (a), 5.2(b)(I), (3), 

5.3(a)(2)(i), (ii)  (20 14).

V. 

FACTS 

18. 

The Relevant Period for this Complaint is January 2012 through  the present. 

] 9. 

Dm·ing the Relevant Period, All ied Markets, by and through Gi ll iland and 

Wongk:hiao, solicited members of the public, by use of the mails and/or other means or 

instrumentalities of interstate. commerce, to send money to bank accounts under Defendants ' 

5 


control  for the purpose of trading agreements, contracts, or transactions  in forcx (foreign 

currency, offered  to  persons who were not eligible contract participants, and  offered, or 

entered into,  on a leveraged or margined basis)  in a pm-ported commodity pool  operated by 

Allied Markets. 

20. 

By  undertaking these solicitations and  accepting,  funds  for a commodity pool , 

Allied Markets, by and through Gilliland and  Wongkhiao, acted as a CPO. 

2 I. 

Through their actions on  behalf of Alli ed Markets, Gi llil and and Wongkhiao 

acted as associated persons of Allied Markets. the CPO. 

22. 

Neither Allied Markets, Gill.iland, nor Wongkhiao has ever been registered 

with the CFTC in any capacity. 

23. 

At least $1  million was deposited  in  accounts under Defendants'  control for 

the purpose of trading forex.  in  a purported commodity pool operated by All ied Markets. 

24. 

OuJing the Relevant Period, at least one pool  participant did not qualify as an 

"eligible contract participant," as that term  is defined  by Section  I a( 18) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 

§ 1a(l8) (2012).  ln  additi on~ the purported commod ity pool operated by Allied Markets was 

not an eligible contract participant during the Relevant Period. 

25. 

On numerous occasions during the Relevant Period, including in or about June 

2012 and in or about July 20 l 3, Defendants fraudulently represented to at least four 

prospective pool participants that Allied Markets'  forex trading offered a safe investment 

with guaranteed  returns, which pool pm-Licipants  were due to receive on a 111011thly or annual 

basis. 

6 


26. 

Defendants knew these representations were false because, among  other 

things, Defendants knew that the purported commodity pool  opeJ"ated  by Al lied Markets, by 

and  througb Gilliland and Wongkhiao, sustai ned overall net losses in  its forex trading 

account during the Relevant Period. 

27. 

Gil liland and Wongkhiao, acting 011  behalf of Allied  Markets_. dfrected at least 

two pool participants to sign agreements with Allied Markets containing fraudu lent 

representations.  Tbese agreements guaranteed rates of return on pool participants'  principal 

of seven and ten percent, respectively.  The agreements also provided that pool pmticipants 

could tenninate their agreement with Allied Markets and that their principal would be 

refunded upon sixty days1  notice.  Wongkhiao signed the agreements as a "Managing 

Member" of All ied Markets. 

28.  While the agreements Allied  Markets executed with pool  participants referred 

to investment returns as 1'interest," Defendants commun icated to p ool participants that their 

funds were to be pooled for trading in forex. and that returns would be derived from  trad ing 

profits.  At least one agre~ment Allied Markets executed with a  pool participant expr~ssly 

stated that the pool would trade forex. 

29. 

During the Relevant Period, Defendants'  representations prompted pool 

participants to provide Defendants at least $1  million for trading forex in the purported 

commodity pool operated by A llied Markets.  Defendants m.isappropriated this money. 

30. 

Defendants directed pool participants to send fonds to bank accounts under 

their contm l.  In operating these bank accounts and accepting f'unds  from  pool  participants, 

Defendants made no distinction between the purported commodity pool operated by All ied 

7 


Markets and Allied Markets as the CPO, and they comm ing'led their p~rsonal funds with 


funds  contributed by pool participants.

Gilliland and Wongkhiao, acting on behalf of Allied Markets, established a 

forex trading account in the name of, and for the benefit of, Allied Markets, not for the 

purp01ied commodity pool operated by A llied Markets. 

32. 

During the Relevant Period, the forex  trading conducted by GiJiiland and/or 

Wongkhiao resu lted in a net loss of approximately $ 190,000. 

33. 

Defendants did  not disclose these losses to poo l participants.  Rather, 

Defendants knowingly misrepresented to pool participants on multiple occasions during the 

Relevant Period, in person and via telepbone, that Defendants ' forex trading was profitable. 

34.  While Defendants initially deposited some ofthe f1mds they received  from 

pool participants into the Allied Markets forex trading account, Defendants used only a small 

portion of those funds for trading. 

35. 

Instead of trading forex as promised , dming the Relevant Period Defendants 

withdrew approximateJy $850, 000 in pool partidpant funds from the All ied Markets forex 

trading account. 

36. 

Us ing pool participants'  funds , Gilliland and Wongkhiao spent approximately 

$64~000 on  restaurants and entertainment, approximately $33,000 on travel , hotels, and  rental

Defendants also us¥d pool participant fonds to pay purported profits, to pay 

other personal expenses, and to  further their fraudt1Jent scheme.  Defendants fai l'ed  to 

disclose to pool participants that Defendants did not invest all  pool participant funds as 

promjsecl. 

39. 

During the Relevant Period,  Defendants distributed approximately $48, I69 in 

purported gains to pool participants.  Defe11dauts  represented that these payments came from 

trading profits.  Contrary lo their representations, Defendants made these payments from  the 

deposits of other pool participants, in the mannei- of a Ponzi sche me.

continue to engage in the acts and practices alleged in this Complaint and similar acts and

Defendants. 

COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, 

CIVIL MONETARY PENALTY, AND OTHER EQUITABLE RELIE.F 


Plaintiff United States Commodity Futures Trading Corn.m ission ("CFTC") alleges as 

follows: 

I. 

SU MMARY 

l . 

Beg inn ing as ea rly as January 20 12, Joshua Gilliland and Chawali t 

Wongkhiao, indiv idua lly and  as principals of A llied Markets LLC ("A ll ied Markets") 

(collectively "Defendants"), have engaged  in a  frau du lent scheme to solicit more than $I 

mill ion from members o f' che public to paJticipate in  a supposed commodity pool purportedly 

trading leveraged or margined retail  off-exchange foreign currency contracts, commonly 

known as "forex." 

2. 

As part of this illegal scheme  Defendants  misappropriated pool participants' 

funds to pay Gill iland 's and Wongk:hiao 's personal expenses.  Gill iland and Wongkhiao 

treated pool participants' funds as their personal bank account, spending pool participants' 

money on restaurants, en tertainment, and living expenses. 

3. 

Defendants made material misrepresentations regarding  their trading expertise 

and profits, and they  fa iled to disclose to prospective and existing pool participants that only 

a small  portion of their funds would be used to  trade  forex, while the rest would  be 

misappropriated  to  pay Gilliland' s a nd  Wongkhiao 's persona l expenses and to fi.irthcr 

Defendants'  fraudu lent scheme. 

4. 

Defendants, who have never been registered as required wilh lhe CFTC,  lured 

their victims  into sending them funds  for their purported commodity pool by fraudulently 

guaranteeing speci fic trading returns and by  representing that Defendants'  frwe:x  tradi ng was 

generating l.arge profits.  At Defendants' direction, pool participants deposited more than 

$ I  million into bank accounts controlled by Defendants.  When Defendants paid what they 

claimed to  be trading profits to  pool participants or supposedly returned pool participants' 

principal, they did so using money paid by other pool particjpants. in che  manner of a Ponzi 

scheme. 

5. 

By virtue of this conduct, and as more fully set forth  below, Defendants have 

engaged, are engaging, and/or are about to engage in acts and practices in  violation of 

Sections 2(c)(2)(C)(iii)(l)(cc), 4b(a)(2)(A) and (C), 4k(2), 4m(l), and 4o(l) of the 

Commodity Exchange Act ('"CEA"), 7  U.S.C. §§ 2(c)(2)(C)(i ii)(l)(cc), 6b(a)(2)(A), (C), 

6k(2), 6m(l), 6o( I) (2012); and CFT C Regul ations 3. 12,4.20(a)-(c), 4.4 1(a), 5.2(b)(1) and

V. 

FACTS 

18. 

The Relevant Period for this Complaint is January 2012 through  the present. 

] 9. 

Dm·ing the Relevant Period, All ied Markets, by and through Gi ll iland and 

Wongk:hiao, solicited members of the public, by use of the mails and/or other means or 

instrumentalities of interstate. commerce, to send money to bank accounts under Defendants ' 

5 


control  for the purpose of trading agreements, contracts, or transactions  in forcx (foreign 

currency, offered  to  persons who were not eligible contract participants, and  offered, or 

entered into,  on a leveraged or margined basis)  in a pm-ported commodity pool  operated by 

Allied Markets. 

20. 

By  undertaking these solicitations and  accepting,  funds  for a commodity pool , 

Allied Markets, by and through Gilliland and  Wongkhiao, acted as a CPO. 

2 I. 

Through their actions on  behalf of Alli ed Markets, Gi llil and and Wongkhiao 

acted as associated persons of Allied Markets. the CPO. 

22. 

Neither Allied Markets, Gill.iland, nor Wongkhiao has ever been registered 

with the CFTC in any capacity. 

23. 

At least $1  million was deposited  in  accounts under Defendants'  control for 

the purpose of trading forex.  in  a purported commodity pool operated by All ied Markets. 

24. 

OuJing the Relevant Period, at least one pool  participant did not qualify as an 

"eligible contract participant," as that term  is defined  by Section  I a( 18) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 

§ 1a(l8) (2012).  ln  additi on~ the purported commod ity pool operated by Allied Markets was 

not an eligible contract participant during the Relevant Period. 

25. 

On numerous occasions during the Relevant Period, including in or about June 

2012 and in or about July 20 l 3, Defendants fraudulently represented to at least four 

prospective pool participants that Allied Markets'  forex trading offered a safe investment 

with guaranteed  returns, which pool pm-Licipants  were due to receive on a 111011thly or annual 

basis. 

6 


26. 

Defendants knew these representations were false because, among  other 

things, Defendants knew that the purported commodity pool  opeJ"ated  by Al lied Markets, by 

and  througb Gilliland and Wongkhiao, sustai ned overall net losses in  its forex trading 

account during the Relevant Period. 

27. 

Gil liland and Wongkhiao, acting 011  behalf of Allied  Markets_. dfrected at least 

two pool participants to sign agreements with Allied Markets containing fraudu lent 

representations.  Tbese agreements guaranteed rates of return on pool participants'  principal 

of seven and ten percent, respectively.  The agreements also provided that pool pmticipants 

could tenninate their agreement with Allied Markets and that their principal would be 

refunded upon sixty days1  notice.  Wongkhiao signed the agreements as a "Managing 

Member" of All ied Markets. 

28.  While the agreements Allied  Markets executed with pool  participants referred 

to investment returns as 1'interest," Defendants commun icated to p ool participants that their 

funds were to be pooled for trading in forex. and that returns would be derived from  trad ing 

profits.  At least one agre~ment Allied Markets executed with a  pool participant expr~ssly 

stated that the pool would trade forex. 

29. 

During the Relevant Period, Defendants'  representations prompted pool 

participants to provide Defendants at least $1  million for trading forex in the purported 

commodity pool operated by A llied Markets.  Defendants m.isappropriated this money. 

30. 

Defendants directed pool participants to send fonds to bank accounts under 

their contm l.  In operating these bank accounts and accepting f'unds  from  pool  participants, 

Defendants made no distinction between the purported commodity pool operated by All ied 

7 


Markets and Allied Markets as the CPO, and they comm ing'led their p~rsonal funds with 


funds  contributed by pool participants. 


31. 

Gilliland and Wongkhiao, acting on behalf of Allied Markets, established a 

forex trading account in the name of, and for the benefit of, Allied Markets, not for the 

purp01ied commodity pool operated by A llied Markets. 

32. 

During the Relevant Period, the forex  trading conducted by GiJiiland and/or 

Wongkhiao resu lted in a net loss of approximately $ 190,000. 

33. 

Defendants did  not disclose these losses to poo l participants.  Rather, 

Defendants knowingly misrepresented to pool participants on multiple occasions during the 

Relevant Period, in person and via telepbone, that Defendants ' forex trading was profitable. 

34.  While Defendants initially deposited some ofthe f1mds they received  from 

pool participants into the Allied Markets forex trading account, Defendants used only a small 

portion of those funds for trading. 

35. 

Instead of trading forex as promised , dming the Relevant Period Defendants 

withdrew approximateJy $850, 000 in pool partidpant funds from the All ied Markets forex 

trading account. 

36. 

Us ing pool participants'  funds , Gilliland and Wongkhiao spent approximately 

$64~000 on  restaurants and entertainment, approximately $33,000 on travel , hotels, and  rental 

cars, and approximately $66,000 on rent for the ir residence in Jacksonville Beach , Florida. 

37. 

During the Relevanl Period, Gilliland and  Wongkhiao also transferred at least 

$83,200 to their personal bank accounts, withdrew approximately$ l 05 ,000 in cash from 

automated teller machines, and withdrew approximately $34,000 in cash at bank branches. 

8 


38. 

Defendants also us¥d pool participant fonds to pay purported profits, to pay 

other personal expenses, and to  further their fraudt1Jent scheme.  Defendants fai l'ed  to 

disclose to pool participants that Defendants did not invest all  pool participant funds as 

promjsecl. 

39. 

During the Relevant Period,  Defendants distributed approximately $48, I69 in 

purported gains to pool participants.  Defe11dauts  represented that these payments came from 

trading profits.  Contrary lo their representations, Defendants made these payments from  the 

deposits of other pool participants, in the mannei- of a Ponzi sche me. 

40.. 

Unless restrained and enjoined QY  this Court>Defendants are  likely to 

continue to engage in the acts and practices alleged in this Complaint and similar acts and 

practices in violation of the CEA and CFTC Regulations.

U.S. COMMODITY FUTURES 
TRADING COMMISSION, 

Plaintiff, 

ALLIED MARKETS LLC, 
JOSHUA GILLILAND, and 
CHAWALIT  WONG KHJA O, 

Defendants. 

COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, 

CIVIL MONETARY PENALTY, AND OTHER EQUITABLE RELIE.F 


Plaintiff United States Commodity Futures Trading Corn.m ission ("CFTC") alleges as 

follows: 

I. 

SU MMARY 

l . 

Beg inn ing as ea rly as January 20 12, Joshua Gilliland and Chawali t 

Wongkhiao, indiv idua lly and  as principals of A llied Markets LLC ("A ll ied Markets") 

(collectively "Defendants"), have engaged  in a  frau du lent scheme to solicit more than $I 

mill ion from members o f' che public to paJticipate in  a supposed commodity pool purportedly 

trading leveraged or margined retail  off-exchange foreign currency contracts, commonly 

known as "forex." 

2. 

As part of this illegal scheme  Defendants  misappropriated pool participants' 

funds to pay Gill iland 's and Wongk:hiao 's personal expenses.  Gill iland and Wongkhiao 

treated pool participants' funds as their personal bank account, spending pool participants' 

money on restaurants, en tertainment, and living expenses. 

3. 

Defendants made material misrepresentations regarding  their trading expertise 

and profits, and they  fa iled to disclose to prospective and existing pool participants that only 

a small  portion of their funds would be used to  trade  forex, while the rest would  be 

misappropriated  to  pay Gilliland' s a nd  Wongkhiao 's persona l expenses and to fi.irthcr 

Defendants'  fraudu lent scheme. 

4. 

Defendants, who have never been registered as required wilh lhe CFTC,  lured 

their victims  into sending them funds  for their purported commodity pool by fraudulently 

guaranteeing speci fic trading returns and by  representing that Defendants'  frwe:x  tradi ng was 

generating l.arge profits.  At Defendants' direction, pool participants deposited more than 

$ I  million into bank accounts controlled by Defendants.  When Defendants paid what they 

claimed to  be trading profits to  pool participants or supposedly returned pool participants' 

principal, they did so using money paid by other pool particjpants. in che  manner of a Ponzi 

scheme. 

5. 

By virtue of this conduct, and as more fully set forth  below, Defendants have 

engaged, are engaging, and/or are about to engage in acts and practices in  violation of 

Sections 2(c)(2)(C)(iii)(l)(cc), 4b(a)(2)(A) and (C), 4k(2), 4m(l), and 4o(l) of the 

Commodity Exchange Act ('"CEA"), 7  U.S.C. §§ 2(c)(2)(C)(i ii)(l)(cc), 6b(a)(2)(A), (C), 

6k(2), 6m(l), 6o( I) (2012); and CFT C Regul ations 3. 12,4.20(a)-(c), 4.4 1(a), 5.2(b)(1) and 

(3), 5.3(a)(2)(i), and 5.3(a)(2)(ii). 17 C.F.R. §§  3. 12, 4.20(a)-(c), 4.41 (a), 5.2(b)(I), (3), 

5.3(a)(2)(i), (ii)  (20 14).

Allied Markets. 

20.

26. 

Defendants knew these representations were false because, among  other 

things, Defendants knew that the purported commodity pool  opeJ"ated  by Al lied Markets, by 

and  througb Gilliland and Wongkhiao, sustai ned overall net losses in  its forex trading 

account during the Relevant Period. 

27. 

Gil liland and Wongkhiao, acting 011  behalf of Allied  Markets_. dfrected at least 

two pool participants to sign agreements with Allied Markets containing fraudu lent 

representations.  Tbese agreements guaranteed rates of return on pool participants'  principal 

of seven and ten percent, respectively.  The agreements also provided that pool pmticipants 

could tenninate their agreement with Allied Markets and that their principal would be 

refunded upon sixty days1  notice.  Wongkhiao signed the agreements as a "Managing 

Member" of All ied Markets. 

28.  While the agreements Allied  Markets executed with pool  participants referred 

to investment returns as 1'interest," Defendants commun icated to p ool participants that their 

funds were to be pooled for trading in forex. and that returns would be derived from  trad ing 

profits.  At least one agre~ment Allied Markets executed with a  pool participant expr~ssly 

stated that the pool would trade forex. 

29. 

During the Relevant Period, Defendants'  representations prompted pool 

participants to provide Defendants at least $1  million for trading forex in the purported 

commodity pool operated by A llied Markets.  Defendants m.isappropriated this money. 

30. 

Defendants directed pool participants to send fonds to bank accounts under 

their contm l.  In operating these bank accounts and accepting f'unds  from  pool  participants, 

Defendants made no distinction between the purported commodity pool operated by All ied 

7 


Markets and Allied Markets as the CPO, and they comm ing'led their p~rsonal funds with 


funds  contributed by pool participants. 


31. 

Gilliland and Wongkhiao, acting on behalf of Allied Markets, established a 

forex trading account in the name of, and for the benefit of, Allied Markets, not for the 

purp01ied commodity pool operated by A llied Markets. 

32. 

During the Relevant Period, the forex  trading conducted by GiJiiland and/or 

Wongkhiao resu lted in a net loss of approximately $ 190,000. 

33. 

Defendants did  not disclose these losses to poo l participants.  Rather, 

Defendants knowingly misrepresented to pool participants on multiple occasions during the 

Relevant Period, in person and via telepbone, that Defendants ' forex trading was profitable. 

34.  While Defendants initially deposited some ofthe f1mds they received  from 

pool participants into the Allied Markets forex trading account, Defendants used only a small 

portion of those funds for trading. 

35. 

Instead of trading forex as promised , dming the Relevant Period Defendants 

withdrew approximateJy $850, 000 in pool partidpant funds from the All ied Markets forex 

trading account. 

36. 

Us ing pool participants'  funds , Gilliland and Wongkhiao spent approximately 

$64~000 on  restaurants and entertainment, approximately $33,000 on travel , hotels, and  rental 

cars, and approximately $66,000 on rent for the ir residence in Jacksonville Beach , Florida. 

37. 

During the Relevanl Period, Gilliland and  Wongkhiao also transferred at least 

$83,200 to their personal bank accounts, withdrew approximately$ l 05 ,000 in cash from 

automated teller machines, and withdrew approximately $34,000 in cash at bank branches. 

8 


38. 

Defendants also us¥d pool participant fonds to pay purported profits, to pay 

other personal expenses, and to  further their fraudt1Jent scheme.  Defendants fai l'ed  to 

disclose to pool participants that Defendants did not invest all  pool participant funds as 

promjsecl. 

39. 

During the Relevant Period,  Defendants distributed approximately $48, I69 in 

purported gains to pool participants.  Defe11dauts  represented that these payments came from 

trading profits.  Contrary lo their representations, Defendants made these payments from  the 

deposits of other pool participants, in the mannei- of a Ponzi sche me.

Unless restrained and enjoined QY  this Court>Defendants are  likely to 

continue to engage in the acts and practices alleged in this Complaint and similar acts and 

practices in violation of the CEA and CFTC Regulations.

JOSHUA GILLILAND, and 
CHAWALIT  WONG KHJA O, 

Defendants. 

COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, 

CIVIL MONETARY PENALTY, AND OTHER EQUITABLE RELIE.F 


Plaintiff United States Commodity Futures Trading Corn.m ission ("CFTC") alleges as 

follows: 

I. 

SU MMARY 

l . 

Beg inn ing as ea rly as January 20 12, Joshua Gilliland and Chawali t 

Wongkhiao, indiv idua lly and  as principals of A llied Markets LLC ("A ll ied Markets") 

(collectively "Defendants"), have engaged  in a  frau du lent scheme to solicit more than $I 

mill ion from members o f' che public to paJticipate in  a supposed commodity pool purportedly 

trading leveraged or margined retail  off-exchange foreign currency contracts, commonly 

known as "forex." 

2. 

As part of this illegal scheme  Defendants  misappropriated pool participants' 

funds to pay Gill iland 's and Wongk:hiao 's personal expenses.  Gill iland and Wongkhiao 

treated pool participants' funds as their personal bank account, spending pool participants' 

money on restaurants, en tertainment, and living expenses. 

3. 

Defendants made material misrepresentations regarding  their trading expertise 

and profits, and they  fa iled to disclose to prospective and existing pool participants that only 

a small  portion of their funds would be used to  trade  forex, while the rest would  be 

misappropriated  to  pay Gilliland' s a nd  Wongkhiao 's persona l expenses and to fi.irthcr 

Defendants'  fraudu lent scheme. 

4. 

Defendants, who have never been registered as required wilh lhe CFTC,  lured 

their victims  into sending them funds  for their purported commodity pool by fraudulently 

guaranteeing speci fic trading returns and by  representing that Defendants'  frwe:x  tradi ng was 

generating l.arge profits.  At Defendants' direction, pool participants deposited more than 

$ I  million into bank accounts controlled by Defendants.  When Defendants paid what they 

claimed to  be trading profits to  pool participants or supposedly returned pool participants' 

principal, they did so using money paid by other pool particjpants. in che  manner of a Ponzi 

scheme. 

5. 

By virtue of this conduct, and as more fully set forth  below, Defendants have 

engaged, are engaging, and/or are about to engage in acts and practices in  violation of 

Sections 2(c)(2)(C)(iii)(l)(cc), 4b(a)(2)(A) and (C), 4k(2), 4m(l), and 4o(l) of the 

Commodity Exchange Act ('"CEA"), 7  U.S.C. §§ 2(c)(2)(C)(i ii)(l)(cc), 6b(a)(2)(A), (C), 

6k(2), 6m(l), 6o( I) (2012); and CFT C Regul ations 3. 12,4.20(a)-(c), 4.4 1(a), 5.2(b)(1) and

V. 

FACTS 

18. 

The Relevant Period for this Complaint is January 2012 through  the present. 

] 9. 

Dm·ing the Relevant Period, All ied Markets, by and through Gi ll iland and 

Wongk:hiao, solicited members of the public, by use of the mails and/or other means or 

instrumentalities of interstate. commerce, to send money to bank accounts under Defendants ' 

5 


control  for the purpose of trading agreements, contracts, or transactions  in forcx (foreign 

currency, offered  to  persons who were not eligible contract participants, and  offered, or 

entered into,  on a leveraged or margined basis)  in a pm-ported commodity pool  operated by 

Allied Markets. 

20. 

By  undertaking these solicitations and  accepting,  funds  for a commodity pool , 

Allied Markets, by and through Gilliland and  Wongkhiao, acted as a CPO. 

2 I. 

Through their actions on  behalf of Alli ed Markets, Gi llil and and Wongkhiao 

acted as associated persons of Allied Markets. the CPO. 

22. 

Neither Allied Markets, Gill.iland, nor Wongkhiao has ever been registered 

with the CFTC in any capacity. 

23. 

At least $1  million was deposited  in  accounts under Defendants'  control for 

the purpose of trading forex.  in  a purported commodity pool operated by All ied Markets. 

24. 

OuJing the Relevant Period, at least one pool  participant did not qualify as an 

"eligible contract participant," as that term  is defined  by Section  I a( 18) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 

§ 1a(l8) (2012).  ln  additi on~ the purported commod ity pool operated by Allied Markets was 

not an eligible contract participant during the Relevant Period. 

25. 

On numerous occasions during the Relevant Period, including in or about June 

2012 and in or about July 20 l 3, Defendants fraudulently represented to at least four 

prospective pool participants that Allied Markets'  forex trading offered a safe investment 

with guaranteed  returns, which pool pm-Licipants  were due to receive on a 111011thly or annual 

basis. 

6 


26. 

Defendants knew these representations were false because, among  other 

things, Defendants knew that the purported commodity pool  opeJ"ated  by Al lied Markets, by 

and  througb Gilliland and Wongkhiao, sustai ned overall net losses in  its forex trading 

account during the Relevant Period. 

27. 

Gil liland and Wongkhiao, acting 011  behalf of Allied  Markets_. dfrected at least 

two pool participants to sign agreements with Allied Markets containing fraudu lent 

representations.  Tbese agreements guaranteed rates of return on pool participants'  principal 

of seven and ten percent, respectively.  The agreements also provided that pool pmticipants 

could tenninate their agreement with Allied Markets and that their principal would be 

refunded upon sixty days1  notice.  Wongkhiao signed the agreements as a "Managing 

Member" of All ied Markets. 

28.  While the agreements Allied  Markets executed with pool  participants referred 

to investment returns as 1'interest," Defendants commun icated to p ool participants that their 

funds were to be pooled for trading in forex. and that returns would be derived from  trad ing 

profits.  At least one agre~ment Allied Markets executed with a  pool participant expr~ssly 

stated that the pool would trade forex. 

29. 

During the Relevant Period, Defendants'  representations prompted pool 

participants to provide Defendants at least $1  million for trading forex in the purported 

commodity pool operated by A llied Markets.  Defendants m.isappropriated this money. 

30. 

Defendants directed pool participants to send fonds to bank accounts under 

their contm l.  In operating these bank accounts and accepting f'unds  from  pool  participants, 

Defendants made no distinction between the purported commodity pool operated by All ied 

7 


Markets and Allied Markets as the CPO, and they comm ing'led their p~rsonal funds with 


funds  contributed by pool participants. 


31. 

Gilliland and Wongkhiao, acting on behalf of Allied Markets, established a 

forex trading account in the name of, and for the benefit of, Allied Markets, not for the 

purp01ied commodity pool operated by A llied Markets. 

32. 

During the Relevant Period, the forex  trading conducted by GiJiiland and/or 

Wongkhiao resu lted in a net loss of approximately $ 190,000. 

33. 

Defendants did  not disclose these losses to poo l participants.  Rather, 

Defendants knowingly misrepresented to pool participants on multiple occasions during the 

Relevant Period, in person and via telepbone, that Defendants ' forex trading was profitable. 

34.  While Defendants initially deposited some ofthe f1mds they received  from 

pool participants into the Allied Markets forex trading account, Defendants used only a small 

portion of those funds for trading. 

35. 

Instead of trading forex as promised , dming the Relevant Period Defendants 

withdrew approximateJy $850, 000 in pool partidpant funds from the All ied Markets forex 

trading account. 

36. 

Us ing pool participants'  funds , Gilliland and Wongkhiao spent approximately 

$64~000 on  restaurants and entertainment, approximately $33,000 on travel , hotels, and  rental 

cars, and approximately $66,000 on rent for the ir residence in Jacksonville Beach , Florida. 

37. 

During the Relevanl Period, Gilliland and  Wongkhiao also transferred at least 

$83,200 to their personal bank accounts, withdrew approximately$ l 05 ,000 in cash from 

automated teller machines, and withdrew approximately $34,000 in cash at bank branches. 

8 


38. 

Defendants also us¥d pool participant fonds to pay purported profits, to pay 

other personal expenses, and to  further their fraudt1Jent scheme.  Defendants fai l'ed  to 

disclose to pool participants that Defendants did not invest all  pool participant funds as 

promjsecl. 

39. 

During the Relevant Period,  Defendants distributed approximately $48, I69 in 

purported gains to pool participants.  Defe11dauts  represented that these payments came from 

trading profits.  Contrary lo their representations, Defendants made these payments from  the 

deposits of other pool participants, in the mannei- of a Ponzi sche me. 

40.. 

Unless restrained and enjoined QY  this Court>Defendants are  likely to 

continue to engage in the acts and practices alleged in this Complaint and similar acts and 

practices in violation of the CEA and CFTC Regulations.
