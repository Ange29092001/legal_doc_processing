ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTIONS 6(c) AND 6(d) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, MAKING
FINDINGS AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

I,

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (““CFTC” or “Commission”) has reason to
believe that Marubeni America Corporation (“Respondent”) violated Commission Regulation
(“Regulation”) 19.01, 17 C.F.R. § 19.01 (2014) from July 2010 through August 2013 (the
“Relevant Period”). Therefore, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest
that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted to determine whether
Respondent engaged in the violations set forth herein and to determine whether any order should
be issued imposing remedial sanctions.

Il.

In anticipation of the institution of this administrative proceeding, Respondent has
submitted an Offer of Settlement (“Offer”), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Without admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, Respondent consents to
the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 6(c) and 6(d) of the
Commodity Exchange Act, Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (“Order”) and
acknowledges service of this Order.'

 

Respondent consents to the entry of this Order and to the use of these findings in this proceeding and in any other
proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party; provided, however, that Respondent
does not consent to the use of the Offer, or the findings or conclusions in this Order consented to in the Offer, as the
sole basis for any other proceeding brought by the Commission, other than in a proceeding in bankruptcy or to
enforce the terms of this Order. Nor does Respondent consent to the use of the Offer or this Order, or the findings or
conclusions in this Order consented to in the Offer, by any other party in any other proceeding.

 
I.
The Commission finds the following:
A. Summary

Under Regulations 19,.00(a)(1) and 19.01, 17 C.F.R. §§19.00(a)(1) and 19.01 (2014), all
persons holding or controlling reportable futures and options positions in certain agricultural
commodities — including wheat, corn, oats, soybeans, soybean oil, and soybean meal — pursuant
to Regulation 15.00(p)(2), 17 C.F.R. §15.00(p)(2) (2014) and any part of which constitute bona
Jide hedging positions as defined in Regulation 1.3(z), 17 C.F.R. §1.3(z) (2011), are required to
file CFTC Form 204 reports showing the composition of the fixed price cash position of each
such commodity hedged. During the Relevant Period, Respondent filed 38 Form 204 reports
with the Commission that did not comply with this requirement.

B. Respondent

Marubeni America Corporation (“MAC”) is a New York corporation with its
headquarters in New York City. MAC is the largest overseas subsidiary of Marubeni
Corporation, a Japanese general trading company based in Tokyo, Japan. MAC is a general
trading company that acts as an intermediary, importer/exporter, facilitator or broker in various
types of trade between business enterprises and countries. MAC trades agricultural
commodities, including corn, wheat, soybeans, and soybean meal. MAC has never been
registered with the Commission in any capacity. .

C, Facts

Respondent is a dealer/merchant in agricultural commodities, including ones covered by
CFTC Form 204, which Respondent hedges with futures contracts. During the Relevant Period,
Respondent filed Form 204 reports that incorrectly stated its fixed price cash positions.

The CFTC Form 204 report is to be filed monthly, as of the close of business on the last
Friday of the month, and is to show the composition of the reporting entity’s fixed price cash
position of each commodity hedged, including the quantity of open fixed price purchase and
fixed price sale commitments in such cash commodities. As the instructions for the Form 204
report state, the filer is to “[r]eport in thousands of bushels the entire quantity of cash stocks
owned and open fixed price cash purchases and cash sales of the commodity and its products and
byproducts.” A purpose of the Form 204 report is to check compliance with speculative position
limits by ensuring that filers that classify their futures positions as hedging actually own or
control offsetting cash positions,

During the Relevant Period, Respondent filed 38 erroneous Form 204 reports with the
Commission, which did not accurately state the quantities of Respondent’s fixed price cash
positions of each commodity hedged. Specifically, the positions the Respondent included in its
Form 204 reports included both basis priced and fixed priced cash positions. After the Relevant
Period, Respondent submitted corrected Form 204 reports that included only its fixed price cash
contracts. Respondent has cooperated in the Division’s investigation.

 
IV,
LEGAL DISCUSSION
a. Statutory Background

Regulation 150.3 exempts positions that qualify as bona fide hedging transactions (as
defined in Regulation 1.3(z), 17 C.F.R. §1.3(z)) from the speculative position limits for various
agricultural commodities set forth in Regulation 150.2. However, such bona fide hedging
transactions are subject to the Commission’s reporting requirements pursuant to Regulations
19,00(a)(1) and 19.01, 17 C.F.R. §§19.00(a)(1) and 19.01 (2014),

Regulation 19.00(a)(1) requires that persons holding or controlling futures and options
positions in certain agricultural commodities that are reportable pursuant to Regulation
15.00(p)(2), 17 C.F.R. §15.00(p)(2) and any part of which constitute bona fide hedging positions
as defined in Regulation 1.3(z), 17 C.F.R. §1.3(z), must file CFTC Form 204 reports showing the
composition of the fixed price cash position of each such commodity hedged (the “Form 204
commodities,” which include wheat, corn, oats, soybeans, soybean oil and soybean meal).
Reportable positions under Regulation 15.00(p)(2) are any combined futures and futures-
equivalent option open contract position as defined in Part 150 of the Regulations in any one
month or in all months combined, either net long or net short in any commodity on any one
reporting market, which positions at the close of the market on the last business day of the week
exceed the net quantity limit in spot, single or in all-months fixed in Regulation 150.2 for the
Form 204 commodities, |

b. Respondent’s Violations of Regulation 19.01, 17 C.F.R. §19.01 (2014)

During the Relevant Period, Respondent held reportable positions in the Form 204
commodities and was required by Regulation 19.00(a)(1) to file Form 204 reports. Regulation
19.01 requires Form 204 reports to show the quantities of the fixed price purchase and sale open
cash positions of each of the Form 204 commodities hedged.

On 38 occasions during the Relevant Period, Respondent did not comply with Regulation
19.01, 17 C.F.R. §19.01, when it submitted Form 204 reports which did not accurately state the
quantities of Respondent’s fixed price open cash positions as required by Regulation 19.01.

Therefore, Respondent violated Regulation 19.01, 17 C.F_R. § 19.01(2014).
