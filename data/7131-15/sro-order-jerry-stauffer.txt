ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF’S EX PARTE
EMERGENCY MOTION FOR STATUTORY RESTRAINING ORDER, EXPEDITED
DISCOVERY, ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE REGARDING PRELIMINARY

INJUNCTION, AND OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF

Plaintiff, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“Commission”), has filed a
Complaint for Permanent Injunction and Other Relief and moved, pursuant to Section 6c(a) of
the Commodity Exchange Act (the “Act’), for an ex parte statutory restraining order freezing
assets, and ordering Defendant to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not be issued.
The Court has considered the pleadings, declarations, cxhibits, and memorandum filed in support
of the Commission’s for a statutory restraining order, and finds that:

1. This Court has jurisdiction over the parties and over the subject matter of this
action pursuant to Sections 2(c)(2) and 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. §§ 2(c)(2) and 13a-1 (2012).

2. Venue lies properly within this District pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act, 7
U.S.C. §13a-1(e) (2012).

3. There is good cause to believe that Jerry Stauffer (“Stauffer” or “Defendant’”’),

has engaged in, is engaging in and is about to engage in acts in violation of Sections 4b(a)(2)(A)-
Case 1:15-cv-00201-PLM *SEALED* Doc #7 ***NOT ON PUBLIC DOCKET*** Filed 02/25/15 Page 2
of 13 Page ID#141

(C) and 40(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. §§ 6b(a)(2)(A)-(C), and 60(1) (2012), and Regulations 4.20
and 5.2(b), 17 C.F.R. §§ 4.20 and 5.2(b), (2014).

4. From as early as June 2010 through the present, Stauffer defrauded at least 9
members of the public of at Icast $968,000 in connection with pooled investments in retail off-
exchange foreign currency contracts (“forex”). To entice members of the public to participate in
the pool, Defendant guaranteed pool participants a monthly return on their investment based on
profits purportedly earned from forex trading. In reality, Defendant never traded forex as he told
pool participants; rather, of the approximately $968,000 provided by pool participants to
Defendant for forex trading, only $200,000 was deposited into trading accounts, approximately
$144,000 was withdrawn, and approximately $45,000 was lost trading. Defendant used pool
participant funds to pay personal credit card bills and expenses, and transferred funds to his boat
company, Atlantic Boat Brokers. To perpctuate his fraud, Defendant prepared and distributed to
pool participants trading statements that indicated successful trading, but in fact, falsely
represented that trading occurred and the purported amount of pool participant funds contained
in the pool’s supposed trading account.

5. There is good cause to belicve that immediate and irreparable damage to the
Court’s ability to grant effective final relief for pool participants in the form of monetary redress
will occur from the sale, transfer, assignment, or other disposition by Defendant of assets or
records unless Defendant is immediately restrained and enjoined by Order of the Court.

6. There is good cause for the Court to freeze assets owned, controlled, managed, or
held by or on behalf of, or for the bencfit of Defendant.

7. There is good cause for entry of an order prohibiting Defendant, his agents,

servants, cmployces, assigns, atterneys; and persons in active concert or participation with
Case 1:15-cv-00201-PLM *SEALED* Doc #7 ***NOT ON PUBLIC DOCKET** Filed 02/25/15 Page 3
of 13 Page ID#142

Defendant, including any successor thereof, from destroying records and/or denying agents of
the Commission access to inspect and copy records to ensure that Commission representatives
have immediate and complete access to those books and records.

8. There is good cause for the Plaintiff to conduct expedited discovery in order to
determine the full extent of Defendant’s alleged wrongdoing, locate Defendant’s other pool
participants, identify pool participant funds and other assets of Defendant and clarify the source
and whereabouts of various funds.

9. Absent the entry of this statutory restraining order, Defendant is likely to dissipate
or transfer assets and destroy business records.

10.‘ This is a proper case for granting an ex parte statutory restraining order to
preserve the status quo, protect public pool participants from loss and damage, and cnable the
Commission to fulfill its statutory duties, therefore the Court orders as follows:
