Plaintiff, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“Commission” or “CFTC”), by

its attorneys, alleges as follows:
I. SUMMARY

l. From as early as June 2010 through the present (“Relevant Period”), Jerry
Stauffer (““Defendant” or “Stauffer’’), defrauded at least 9 members of the public (“pool
participants”) of at least $968,000 in connection with pooled investments in retail off-exchange
foreign currency contracts (“forex”).

2. In order to invest, pool participants were instructed to make their checks payable
to “Jerry Stauffer,” the commodity pool operator (“CPO”), These checks were deposited into
bank accounts in Stauffer’s name. In accepting funds from pool participants, Stauffer made no
distinction between the pool and Jerry Stauffer as the CPO.

3. To entice members of the public to participate in the pool, Defendant guaranteed
pool participants a monthly return on their investment based on profits purportedly earned from
forex trading at Interactive Brokers, LLC (“IB”), a Futures Commission Merchant (“FCM”).

Pool participants were asked to sign a “Limited Power of Attorney with Exclusive Rights to
Trade Foreign Exchange Currencies” (“LPOA”), and were advised that no more than 2% of their
funds would ever be placed at risk per day.

4, In reality, Defendant never traded forex at IB as he told pool participants; rather,
of the approximately $968,000 provided by pool participants to Defendant for forex trading
during the Relevant Period, only $200,000 was deposited into trading accounts, approximately
$144,000 was withdrawn, and approximately $45,000 was lost trading at a different financial
institution. Approximately $1.2 million was returned to pool participants as purported trading
profits and return on principal. Defendant used pool participant funds to pay personal credit card
bills and expenses, and transferred funds to his boat company, Atlantic Boat Brokers.

5, To perpetuate his fraud, Defendant prepared and distributed to pool participants
trading statements that indicated successful trading at IB, but in fact, falsely represented that
trading occurred at IB and the purported amount of pool participant funds contained in the pool’s
supposed trading account.

6. By virtue of this conduct and conduct further described herein, Defendant
engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in acts and practices in violation of Sections
4b(a)(2)(A)-(C), and 401 of the Commodity Exchange Act (the “Act”), 7 U.S.C. §§ 6b(a)(2)(A)-
(C), and 60(1) (2012) and Commission Regulations (“Regulations”) 4.20(a)-(c), and 5.2(b), 17
C.F.R. §§ 4.20(a)-(c), and 5.2(b) (2014).

7. Accordingly, pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § [3a-1 (2012), the
Commission brings this action to enjoin Defendant’s unlawful acts and practices and to compel
his compliance with the Act and Regulations and to further enjoin him from engaging in any

commodity-related activity. In addition, the Commission seeks restitution, civil monetary
penalties and remedial ancillary relief, including, but not limited to, disgorgement, and trading
and registration bans, and such other relief as the Court may deem necessary and appropriate.

8. Unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, Defendant likely will continue to
engage in the acts and practices alleged in this Complaint and similar acts and practices, as more
fully described below.

Il. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

9. Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1 (2012), authorizes the Commission to
seek injunctive and other relief against any person whenever it shall appear to the Commission
that such person has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in any act or practice
constituting a violation of any provision of the Act or any rule, regulation, or order thereunder.

10. | The Court has jurisdiction over the conduct and transactions at issue in this case
pursuant to Sections 2(c)(2) and 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. §§ 2(c)(2) and 13a-1(2012).

11. | Venue properly lies with this Court pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
§ 13a-1(e) (2012), because Defendant transacts business in this District, several victims of
Defendant’s fraud reside in this District, and certain transactions, acts, practices, and courses of
business alleged in this Complaint occurred, are occurring, or are about to occur within this
District.

Ill. PARTIES

12. _—_ Plaintiff U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an independent
federal regulatory agency charged by Congress with the administration and enforcement of the
Act, 7 U.S.C. §§ 1 et seq. (2012), and the Regulations promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. §§ 1.1

et seq. (2014).
13. Defendant Jerry Stauffer is an individual residing in Traverse City, Michigan.
On February 16, 2011, Stauffer filed a registration exemption with the Commission, which was
subsequently withdrawn on March 5, 2013. Upon information and belief, Stauffer was not
entitled to claim this exemption. Stauffer has never been registered with the Commission.
Further, Stauffer is the officer, owner, principal, and sole proprietor of Atlantic Boat Brokers.
Atlantic Boat Brokers is in the business purchasing new or used boats in the United States.

IV. FACTS

14. During the Relevant Period, Stauffer solicited prospective pool participants in
person to send funds to him to trade forex in a commodity pool he operated. As part of his
solicitation, Defendant told prospective pool participants that he traded forex for a living, was a
successful trader and that he taught forex trading classes. Defendant showed at least one pool
participant past performance charts, indicating his success at trading forex. Stauffer told at least
one pool participant that the forex trading would occur at IB, a reputable FCM. In reality,
Stauffer’s minimal forex trading prior to the Relevant Period was unprofitable.

15. Defendant reinforced the belief that he was highly successful by guaranteeing a
return on prospective pool participants’ investments. Defendant had pool participants sign an
LPOA which promised prospective pool participants, among other things: 1) a steady 5%
monthly return on investment; or 2) the monthly return would be rolled over each month and
pool participants would receive compound interest of 5% in their account; or 3) a steady 10%
monthly return on investment. The LPOAs were countersigned by Stauffer.

16. | Defendant’s representations prompted at least 9 pool participants to provide
Defendant approximately $968,000 for trading forex in the pool. In order to invest, pool

participants were instructed to make their checks payable to “Jerry Stauffer,” the CPO. These
checks were deposited into bank accounts in Stauffer’s name. In accepting funds from pool
participants, Stauffer made no distinction between the pool and Jerry Stauffer as the CPO,
accepted money in his own name and commingled pool participant funds with his own funds.

17. In June 2010, Defendant opened a trading account at IB (“2010 IB trading
account”), but never deposited any pool participant funds into the account. The account
subsequently closed in September 2010.

18. Stauffer misrepresented to pool participants that the 2010 IB trading account was
funded. For instance, Stauffer gave one pool participant an outgoing wire transfer request,
indicating that the pool participant’s funds were deposited into Defendant’s bank account at
Citibank, N.A. (“Citibank”) in June 2010, when in fact, Stauffer did not have a bank account at
that institution. Stauffer then gave the same pool participant a copy of a July 2010 trading
statement of the 2010 IB trading account, reflecting a transfer of the supposed Citibank funds
(and other funds from his purported Citibank account) into the account.

19. Rather than fully fund and trade the 2010 IB trading account as he told pool
participants he would, Defendant opened a forex trading account at OANDA, a Retail Foreign
Exchange Dealer (“RFED”) in February 2011, and funded it with approximately $95,000. Over
the life of the OANDA trading account, Defendant withdrew approximately $93,000, and made
approximately $8,500 in profits from trading forex. In January 2012, Defendant opened a trading
account at FX Direct Dealer, another RFED. Stauffer similarly funded this account with $95,000,
incurred trading losses of approximately $54,000, and withdrew the remaining approximately
$41,000. In April 2012, Stauffer opened a second forex trading account at IB, funding it with
approximately $10,000; however, no trading activity occurred during the life of this account, and

Stauffer made three withdrawals totaling $9,850.
20. ‘In order to conceal and perpetrate his fraud, Defendant sent numerous pool
participants false 2010 IB trading account statements that indicated Defendant was engaged in
profitable trading at IB in the United Kingdom, when in fact, he conducted no trading at all for
the pool at IB, either in the United States or the United Kingdom.

21. According to these fraudulent 2010 IB trading account statements, Defendant’s
alleged trading in January 2012 resulted in an account balance of approximately $683,000, and
the trading in November 2012 resulted in an account balance of approximately $799,000. Pool
participants were paid profits from the purported successful trading in the UK, when in reality,
Defendant did not have an account at IB in the UK and failed to earn any profits whatsoever in
any IB trading account. These purported profits and successful trading results prompted existing
pool participants to invest additional funds, and caused at least two pool participants to solicit
friends and family to participate in the pool.

22. In August 2013, Defendant emailed pool participants that his 2010 IB trading
account had been hacked and the account had been traded in such a manner as to incur
substantial losses. Defendant provided numerous pool participants with an IB account statement
for July 2013, which showed a purported loss of more than $695,000. Defendant also spoke with
one or more pool participants over the telephone regarding the hacking.

23. Defendant told pool participants that he called IB’s customer service in
Connecticut and London, and was advised that the attack occurred through Defendant’s
computer, and was not related to a security problem with IB’s security network.

24. Defendant also told pool participants that he notified the International Operations

Division of the FBI about the attack and that he also hired a company called Cyber Investigation

Services to investigate the attack.
25. In September 2013, Defendant notified pool participants via email that IB
informed him that someone with his personal information had contacted IB and requested access
to the account. Defendant became suspicious that someone was attempting to steal his identity
and, therefore, decided to close his trading account. As a result, Defendant told pool participants
that the remaining funds would be transferred to a trading account at OANDA. Defendant told at
least one pool participant that he planned to recoup the losses by trading at OANDA, and that he
subsequently planned to make each pool participant whole.

26. In reality, Stauffer’s trading account at IB was never hacked, nor did the account
sustain trading losses as a result thereof as was told to pool participants, because over the life of
the account, no trading occurred. Given this fact, it is highly doubtful that Defendant contacted
either the FBI or Cyber Investigation Services to investigate a hacking incident of a trading
account that never traded and was closed in September 2010.

27. Contrary to what was told to pool participants, Defendant did not close his IB
account on his own volition. In August 2013, IB terminated its relationship with Stauffer and
closed his only funded account, which was opened in April 2012. Further, Defendant did not
transfer any funds to his existing OANDA account in or after July 2013.

28. | Defendant’s purported forex pool was a sham. Out of the approximately $968,000
received from pool participants, Defendant deposited only $200,000 in trading accounts,
withdrew approximately $144,000, and approximately $45,000 was lost trading. Defendant
returned approximately $1.2 million in the form of purported monthly profits from forex trading
and/or return of principal.

29. Stauffer misappropriated pool participant funds by using them for purposes other

than trading. In fact, he traded a very small amount of pool participant funds, used pool

7
participant funds to pay personal credit cards and expenses, transferred funds to his boat
company, Atlantic Boat Brokers, and paid pool participants purported profits (in the manner of a

Ponzi scheme) on the virtually non-existent trading.

30. Defendant knowingly and willfully made, or caused other pool participants to
make, multiple material misrepresentations and omissions in his solicitation of existing and
prospective pool participants, including as described above. In making their investment
decisions, existing and prospective participants in the pool relied on Defendant’s material
misrepresentations and omissions including statements regarding Stauffer’s trading activity,
purported profits earned from that trading, and manner in which pool participants’ funds would

be used.
