CASHIERS

by and through its undersigned attorneys, hereby alleges as follows:

I. SUMMARY

1. From at least February 2015 through at least April 28, 2015, Defendants Heet

Khara and Nasim Salim engaged in unlawful disruptive trading practices or conduct

in the gold

and silver futures markets on or subject to the rules of a registered entity, the Commodity

Exchange, Inc. (““COMEX”), that were, were of the character or, or were commonly

known to

the trade as “spoofing” (bidding or offering with the intent to cancel the bid or offer before

execution), Defendants’ disruptive trading practices or conduct violated Section 4c(a)(5)(C) of

the Commodity Exchange Act (the “Act”), 7 U.S.C. § 6c(a)(5)(C).

2. Plaintiff CFTC brings this action pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. §

other equitable relief, including but not limited to disgorgement, as this Court deems necessary
and appropriate.

II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

V. FACTS

A. Background

a) Defendants’ Trading Accounts

11.  Onor about January 22, 2015, Defendant Khara sought to open a futures trading
account with FCM A.

12. Defendant Khara was introduced to FCM A through introducing broker Zonyx,
DMCC (“Zonyx”). Zonyx is not registered with the Commission. The head and authorized

trader of Zonyx is Defendant Salim.
13. On January 29, 2015, FCM A sent an email to Zonyx indicating its introduced
account for Khara had been approved.

14. Onor about January 29, 2015, Defendant Khara deposited approximately
$400,000 into the account at FCM A. As of March 5, 2015, Defendant Khara had made
withdrawals of approximately $618,000 from the account at FCM A, which is approximately
$218,000 more than what was deposited with FCM A.

15. After closing his account with FCM A on or about March 13, 2015, Defendant
Khara opened a futures trading account with FCM B. Defendant Khara deposited approximately
$400,000 into the account at FCM B in March 2015. Defendant Khara made an additional wire
transfer into the account of approximately $115,000 on or about April 10, 2015, for total deposits
of approximately $515,000.

16. Defendant Salim traded futures contracts through a different futures commission
merchant, FCM B. Defendant Salim, through Zonyx, has held an account with FCM B since
2008.

b) Defendants’ Disruptive Trading Activity: Spoofing

17. Between at least February 2015 and at least April 28, 2015, Defendant Heet
Khara entered orders for Gold and Silver contracts on COMEX, which he did not intend to
execute, and thereby engaged in disruptive trading activity, known as spoofing.

8. In February 2015, for example, Defendant Khara entered orders through FCM A
for Gold and Silver futures contracts that he did not intend to execute. In other words, Defendant
Khara submitted bids or offers on the COMEX exchange with the intent to cancel the bid or offer
before execution. Defendant Khara entered such orders by, among other means, entering several

orders on one side of the market (“layered orders”) while also having one or more smaller orders
on the opposite side of the market. Once the smaller order(s) traded, Khara would cancel the
layered orders.

19. The trading information on February 18, 2015 is as follows: From 04:02:17.233
to 04:02:18.265 a.m. Central Standard Time, Khara placed four 4-lot bids in the Silver futures
contract at the third through fourth book levels (price of 16455-16460). Approximately one
second later, at 04:02:19.329, Khara began to enter 4-lot offers. Between 04:02:19.329 and
04:02:28.312 a.m. Khara entered 53 4-lot offers for a total sell side exposure of 212 contracts.
The offers were entered in descending price starting at 16490 through 16465. Two-milliseconds
after entering the last 4-lot offer (04:02:28.314) 8 contracts of Khara’s 16 resting bids (i.c., the
four 4-lot bids) traded. All 212 of the 4-lot offers were cancelled in full after this sequence.

20. ‘In February 2015, CME Group’s Market Regulation Department (“Market
Regulation”) identified Defendant Khara’s trading practices and informed Defendant Khara that
it was investigating his conduct.

21. On February 24, 2015, Market Regulation informed FCM A of its concerns with
respect to Khara’s order entry and trading practices. Later that day, on February 24, 2015, FCM
A sent an e-mail to Khara and Salim (Zonyx, DMCC) informing them that Market Regulation
had concerns that Defendant Khara may be engaged in disruptive trading practices known as
spoofing.

22. On February 25, 2015, Market Regulation identified that on or about that same
day, Khara had engaged in similar disruptive trading practices to those Khara engaged in on
February 18, 2015, as set forth above. Market Regulation contacted FCM A, and as a result,

FCM A suspended Defendant Khara’s electronic trading access.
23. Market Regulation’s review of Defendant Khara’s trading activity while at FCM
A reflects that Khara engaged in a pattern of spoofing activity during the time the account was
open.

24, Within the Relevant Period, Defendant Khara made a profit of over $200,000 in
approximately one month of trading in the account with FCM A.

25. After FCM A suspended Khara’s electronic trading access, Defendant Khara
closed his account and withdrew all of the funds in the account. Defendant Khara then opened
an account with a different futures commission merchant, FCM B. FCM B is a COMEX
clearing member firm.

26. Defendant Salim had an existing trading account at FCM B, through Zonyx,
where Defendant Khara opened his second account.

27. Defendants Khara and Salim engaged in similar trading practices in a coordinated
fashion through FCM B, including as recently as April 28, 2015.

28. For example, on April 28, 2015, Defendant Salim had an order for Gold futures
on one side of the book. Defendant Khara entered layered orders on the opposite side of the
book as Defendant Salim’s orders, which caused COMEX market participants to fill Defendant
Salim’s orders. After Defendant Salim’s orders were filled, Defendant Khara cancelled his
layered orders.

29. | Anexample of the coordinated effort to engage in spoofing is as follows: On
April 27, 2015, at 05:49:37.957 a.m. Central Standard Time, Salim placed one 3-lot bid in the

June 2015 Gold futures contract at the second book level (price of 11817). Approximately three

seconds later, at 05:49:40.725 a.m., Khara began to enter 5-lot offers. Between 05:49:40.725

and 05:49:43.725 a.m., Khara entered 17 5-lot offers for a total sell side exposure of 85
contracts. The offers were entered in descending price starting at 11820 through 11818. One-
millisecond after entering the fourteenth 5-lot offer (05:49:43.420 a.m.) all 3 contracts of Salim’s
bid traded (05:49:43:421). After this sequence, Khara cancelled all of his offers.

30. Based on this conduct, Market Regulation conducted a review of Defendants’
accounts, for the period of March 1, 2015 to April 29, 2015, in the April 2015 Gold, June 2015
Gold and May 2015 Silver contracts.

31. During the Relevant Period, Defendants Khara and Salim appeared to routinely
place large aggregate quantities opposite smaller orders that would then trade, and then the large
orders would be cancelled. On information and belief, Khara traded more than 300 futures
contracts as a result of Salim’s large opposite-side exposure, and Salim traded more than 150
futures contracts as a result of Khara’s large opposite side exposure.

32. In addition to having engaged in coordinated spoofing activity with Khara, Salim
also engaged in spoofing activity on an individual basis. For example, on March 25, 2015, at
3:43:57.652 a.m. CST, Salim entered an order in April 2015 Gold futures on CME Globex to sell
one contract at 11923, which joined the best offer in the market at that time. Approximately five
seconds later, at 3:44:02.782 a.m., Salim began entering 5-lot buy orders at the price of 11922,
which was the best bid price. He entered seven consecutive 5-lot buy orders each approximately
one-fifth of a second apart; while he was in the process of entering these orders, his |-lot sell
order at 11923 traded. One-half second later, at 3:44:04.373 a.m., Salim cancelled all seven of
his buy orders.

33. On April 29, 2015, Market Regulation contacted FCM A and FCM B regarding
Defendants’ disruptive trading practices. Market Regulation attempted to contact Defendants

Khara and Salim by telephone but was unsuccessful. Market Regulation also sent emails to
Defendants Khara and Salim indicating that their trading activity appeared disruptive. The
emails requested that Defendants Khara and Salim cease all trading activity on CME Group
exchanges, that they not attempt to withdraw funds held at any firm involved in trading on CME
Group exchanges, and that they submit to an interview by exchange staff.

34. On April 29, 2015, Defendant Khara responded to Market Regulation’s email
indicating that he would like to withdraw his funds. Defendant Khara also contacted FCM B and
requested that it close his account and attempted to withdraw his funds.

35. Defendant Salim did not respond to Market Regulation’s correspondence.

36. | Onor about April 30, 2015, CME Group issued notices summarily denying
Defendant Khara and Salim access to all CME Group markets and any trading platforms owned
or controlled by CME Group.

37. Onor about May 1, 2015, Market Regulation was contacted by a representative of
FCM B, who advised that Khara sent FCM B an email suggesting that CME Group had
authorized a return of the funds held in Khara’s account.

38. Khara’s representation was false. CME Group did not make any statements or

representations authorizing the return of the funds.
VI. VIOLATION OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT
COUNT I
Violation of Section 4c(a)(5)(C) of the Act,
7 U.S.C. § 6e(a)(5)(C)
(Disruptive Practices - Spoofing)

39. The allegations set forth in paragraphs | to 38 are re-alleged and incorporated
herein by reference.

40. Section 4c(a)(5)(C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 6c(a)(5)(C), makes it unlawful “for any
person to engage in any trading, practice, or conduct on or subject to the rules of a registered
entity that -- (C) is, is of the character of, or is commonly known to the trade as, ‘spoofing’
(bidding or offering with the intent to cancel the bid or offer before execution).”

41. As described above, beginning in at least February 2015 and continuing to at least
April 28, 2015, Defendants violated Section 4c(a)(5)(C) by entering orders that they intended to
cancel before execution.

42. Section 13(a) of the Act provides that “[a]ny person who commits, or who
willfully aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures the commission of, a violation of
any of the provisions of the Act . . . or who acts in combination or concert with any other person
in any such violation, or who willfully causes an act to be done or omitted which if directly
performed or omitted by him or another would be a violation of the provisions of this Act...
may be held responsible for such violation as a principal.”

43. | Because Defendant Khara and Defendant Salim aided and abetted each other’s
spoofing conduct and acted in combination or concert with each other in the spoofing conduct in
violation of the Act, as set forth above, pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Act, each are responsible

_ as a principal for the violations of Section 4c(a)(5)(C) of the Act.
44. — Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act provides that “[t]he act, omission, or failure of any
official, agent, or other person acting for any individual, association, partnership, corporation, or
trust within the scope of his employment or office shall be deemed the act, omission, or failure of
such individual, association, partnership, corporation or trust, as well as of such official, agent, or
other person.”

45. Because Defendant Khara and Defendant Salim were “acting for” each other as
agents, within the scope of their employment or office, pursuant to Section 2(a)(1)(B), the
spoofing conduct in violation of the Act shall be deemed the act of the other, such that each are
responsible as principals for the violations of Section 4c(a)(5)(C).

46. __ Each act of disruptive trading practice, including but not limited to those
specifically alleged herein, is alleged as a separate and distinct violation of Section 4c(a)(5)(C)

of the Act.
