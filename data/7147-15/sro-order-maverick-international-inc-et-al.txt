WESLEY ALLEN BROWN,

and
MAVERICK INTERNATIONAL, _
INC.,

Defendants.

 

 

Sealed Order Granting Plaintiff’s Ex Parte Motion for Statutory Restraining Order
Plaintiff, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“Commission” or

“CFTC”), has filed a Complaint for Permanent Injunction and Other Relief, and has moved,

pursuant to Section 6c(a) of the Commodity Exchange Act (the “Act”), 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1(a)

(2012), for an ex parte statutory restraining order enjoining defendants Wesley Allen Brown

 

(“Brown”), Edward Rubin (“Rubin”) and Maverick International, Inc. (“Maverick”)
(collectively the “Defendants”’) from destroying, altering, or disposing of, or refusing to
permit authorized representatives of the Commission to inspect and copy any books or
records or other documents, including electronically stored information (“ESI”), and further
enjoining Defendants from withdrawing, transferring, removing, dissipating, or disposing of
any funds, assets or other property. The Court has considered the pleadings, declarations,

exhibits, and memorandum filed in support of the Commission’s motion for a statutory

restraining order, and finds that:

 
l. This Court has jurisdiction over the parties and over the subject matter of this
action pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1 (2012), and Section 2(c)(2) of the
Act, 7 U.S.C. § 2(c)(2) (2012).

2. Venue lies properly within this District pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act, 7
U.S.C. 13a-1(e) (2012) in that the acts or practices described in the Complaint took place
within this District.

3. There is good cause to believe that Defendants have engaged in, and may

 

continue to engage in certain unlawful conduct, including, but not limited to:
| misappropriating participants’ funds, making affirmative material misrepresentations to pool _
participants and/or prospective pool participants, acting as an unlawfully unregistered
commodity pool operator (“CPO”) or'an unlawfully unregistered associated person (“AP”) of
a CPO, improperly commingling pool participants’ funds with personal and other business-
related funds, and engaging in other acts, practices or a course of business that defrauded
pool participants or prospective pool participants, operated as a fraud or deceit on pool
participants, cheated or defrauded or attempted to cheat or defraud other persons, or willfully

deceived or attempted to deceive other persons.in connection with a pooled investment

vehicle that is not an eligible contract participant (“ECP”), as defined by Section 1a(11) of
the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 1a(11) (2012), in connection with leveraged, margined or financed
foreign currency transactions (“forex”) as described in Section 2(c)(2)(C)(i) of the Act, 7
U.S.C. § 2(c)(2)(C)() (which are subject to the anti-fraud provisions of Section 4b(a)(2)(A)
and (C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 6b(a)(2)(A), (C), pursuant to Sections 2(\(2\(C)GID and

2(c)(2)(C)(iv) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. §§ 2(c)(2)(C) 1) (D, 2(c)(2)(C)(Gv)), in violation of

 

 

 

 
|
|

Sections 2(c)(2)(C)(iii)(D(ce), 4b(a)(2)(A), (C), and 40(1)(A)-(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
|

§§ 2(c)(2)(C)(iii)(D(cc), 6b(a)(2)(A), (C) and 60(1)(A)-(B) (2012), and Commission

Regulation 5.3(a)(2)(i) and (ii), 17 C.F.R. §5.3(a)(2)(i) and (ii) (2014).

4, There is good cause to believe that immediate and irreparable damage to the

Court’s ability to grant effective final relief for customers in the form of monetary redress

|

will occur from the continued sale, transfer, assignment, or other disposition by Defendants

of assets or records unless Defendants are immediately restrained and enjoined by Order of
the Court. !

|
5. There is good cause for the Court to impose a restraining order prohibiting

Defendants and their agents, servants, employees, attorneys, and other persons who are in
active concert or participation with them, from withdrawing, transferring, removing,
dissipating, or disposing of any funds, assets, or other property owned, controlled, managed,

or held by or on behalf of, or for the benefit of Defendants.
|

6. There is good cause for entry of an order prohibiting Defendants, and their
|

. |, . er
agents, servants, employees, assigns, attorneys, and persons in active concert or participation
! |

with the Defendants, including any successor thereof, from destroying records and/or

|
denying agents of the Commission access to inspect and copy records to ensure that

|
Commission representatives have immediate and complete access to all such books and

records.
7. Absent the entry of this statutory restraining order, the Defendants are likely

|

to dissipate or transfer assets and destroy business records.
|
!
!
8. This is a proper case for granting a statutory restraining order ex parte to

. |
preserve the status quo, protect public customers from loss and damage, and enable the

Commission to fulfill its statutory duties, therefore the Court orders as follows:
|
