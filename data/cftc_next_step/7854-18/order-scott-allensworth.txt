This matter is before the Court on Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading
Commission’s (“Commission” or “CFTC”) Motion for Entry of Default Judgment,
Permanent Injunction, and Other Ancillary Equitable Relief against Defendants Scott
Allensworth, individually and d/b/a Capital Growth Group Associates and Cobra
Development Group LLP (“Allensworth”); Robert J. Fusco (“Fusco”); David Weddle
(“Weddle”); and E-Slate, Inc. d/b/a Cobra Development Group LLP (“E-Slate’”). (Dkt.
No. 63 (the “Motion”).)

As set forth below, the Court grants the Motion, enters default judgment against all
Defendants, and orders the injunctive and monetary relief described below.

I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY

1. On September 26, 2017, Plaintiff CFTC lodged with the Court under seal a
Complaint for Injunctive and Other Equitable Relief and for Civil Monetary Penalties
Under the Commodity Exchange Act and Commission Regulations against Defendants
Allensworth, Fusco, Weddle, and E-Slate (Dkt. No. 1).

2. The Complaint was filed on the Civil Docket on October 2, 2017. (Ud.)

3. The Commission’s Complaint alleges that from at least December 2013
through filing on October 2, 2017 (the “Relevant Period”), Defendants defrauded
members of the public in connection with the alleged pooled investment of funds in
commodity futures contracts. The Complaint further alleges that Defendants
misappropriated customer funds for their own benefit, and issued false trading
statements in order to carry on and conceal their fraud. In addition, the Complaint
alleges that Defendants were required to be registered with the Commission as a
commodity pool operator (“CPO”) or as an associated person (“AP”) of a CPO, but
failed to do so. By virtue of this conduct, the Complaint alleges that all Defendants
violated Sections 4b(a)(1)(A)-(C) and 40(1)(A)-(B) of the Commodity Exchange Act
(“Act”), 7 U.S.C. §§ 6b(a)(1)(A)-(C), 60(1 )(A)-(B) (2012) (Count I and Count I);
Defendants Fusco and Weddle violated Commission Regulation (“Regulation”) 4.20(b)
and (c), 17 C.F.R. § 4.20(b), (c) (2018) (Count HI); Defendants Fusco and Weddle

violated 4m(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 6m(1) (2012) (Count I'V); and all Defendants
violated Section 4k(2)(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 6k(2)() (2012) and Regulation 3.12(a),
17 C.F.R. § 3.12(a) (2018) (Count V).

4. On October 3, 2017, the Court issued an Ex Parte Statutory Restraining
Order prohibiting Defendants Allensworth, E-Slate, and Fusco from dissipating or
disposing of any assets and refusing to permit representatives of the CFTC from
inspecting their books, records, and other documents. (Dkt. No. 15).

5. Defendants Allensworth and E-Slate were personally served with process
on October 4, 2017, by CFTC Futures Trading Investigator Elsie Robinson, who
personally delivered a copy of the Summons and Complaint to Allensworth. (Dkt. Nos.
30 & 32).

6. Defendant Fusco was personally served with process on October 5, 2017,
by Ms. Robinson, who personally delivered a copy of the Summons and Complaint to
Fusco. (Dkt. No. 31).

7. Defendant Weddle was personally served with process on October 11,
2017, by private process server. (Dkt. No. 37).

8. Pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 6(a)(1)(C) and 12(a)(1)(A)Q),
Defendants Weddle and E-Slate were required to answer or otherwise respond to the
Complaint within 21 days of service, or by October 25, 2017, for E-Slate, and
November 6, 2017, for Weddle.

9, On November 21, 2017, Plaintiff CFTC filed a Motion for Entry of
Default against Defendants Weddle and E-Slate (Dkt. No. 51) pursuant to Rule 55(a) of
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The Clerk of Court granted the motion and
entered default against Defendants Weddle and E-Slate on November 27, 2017.

10. On October 17, 2017, and based on a joint motion (Dkt. No. 34), the Court
entered Consent Orders of Preliminary Injunction and Other Equitable Relief against
Defendants Allensworth (Dkt. No. 41) and Fusco (Dkt. No. 42), and removed the
scheduled preliminary injunction hearing from the Court’s Docket (Dkt. No. 40).

11. The CFTC and Defendants Allensworth and Fusco requested that the
responsive pleading deadline for Defendants Allensworth and Fusco to respond to the
CFTC’s Complaint be extended on two separate occasions (Dkt. Nos. 43 & 54). The
Court granted the first request (Dkt. No. 50), and denied the second but nevertheless
extended the responsive pleading deadline by an additional period of time the Court
found appropriate under the circumstances (Dkt. No. 56).

12. The Court thereafter entered an Order granting Defendants Allensworth
and Fusco an extension of time up to and including February 15, 2018, to file a
responsive pleading so that they could explore the retention of legal counsel to represent
them in the action or else appear pro se. (Dkt. No. 58).

13. Neither Defendant Allensworth nor Defendant Fusco served or filed a
responsive pleading to the CFTC’s Complaint by the February 15, 2018, Court-ordered
deadline. Defendants Allensworth and Fusco also failed to serve or file a responsive
pleading, or otherwise appear in the lawsuit, for over a month after the February 15,
2018, Court-ordered deadline. In response, and on March 23, 2018, Plaintiff CFTC
filed a Motion for Entry of Default against Defendants Allensworth and Fusco (Dkt.
No. 59), pursuant to Rule 55(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

14. On March 26, 2018, the Clerk of Court granted the CFTC’s motion and
entered default against Defendants Allensworth and Fusco (Dkt. No. 60).

15. The only pleadings filed by or on behalf of any Defendant involve the Joint
Motion for Entry of Consent Orders of Preliminary Injunction and Other Equitable
Relief and memorandum in support (Dkt. Nos. 34 & 35), Joint Motion for Extension of
Time for Defendants Allensworth and Fusco to File Responsive Pleadings (Dkt. No.
43), Second Request and Stipulation for Extension of Time for Defendants Allensworth
and Fusco to File Responsive Pleadings (Dkt. No. 54), and Third Request and
Stipulation for Extension of Time for Defendants Allensworth and Fusco to File
Responsive Pleadings (Dkt. No. 57).

16. Plaintiffs Motion was heard on October 9, 2018. Defendants Allensworth

and Fusco appeared at the hearing. Allensworth and Fusco represented to the Court that
they did not oppose entry of default judgment or the amount of restitution as indicated
in Plaintiff's proposed default judgment, but objected to the proposed amount regarding
civil penalties. After meeting and conferring, the parties were unable to agree on an
amount regarding civil penalties. Allensworth requested that the Court impose civil
penalties equal to half of Plaintiff's proposed amount, and Fusco requested that the
Court impose civil penalties equal to the amount for restitution.

17. As ofthe date of this Order, Defendants Allensworth, Fusco, Weddle, and
E-Slate have failed to file an answer or response to the Complaint.

Hl. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

18. This Court has jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (2012)
(federal question jurisdiction) and 28 U.S.C. § 1345 (2012) (district courts have original
jurisdiction over civil actions commenced by the United States or by any agency
expressly authorized to sue by Act of Congress). Section 6c(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. §
13a-1(a) (2012), authorizes the Commission to seek injunctive and other relief against
any person whenever it appears to the Commission that such person has engaged, is
engaging, or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a violations of any
provision of the Act or any rule, regulation, or order thereunder.

19. | Venue properly lies in this District pursuant to 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1(e),
because Defendants transacted business in this District, and certain of the acts and
practices in violations of the Act and Regulations occurred, are occurring, or are about to
occur within this District, among other places.

Il. DISCUSSION

20. The Complaint pleads sufficient facts to state claims for each of the
violations of the Act and Regulations set forth therein. Therefore, the merits of
Plaintiff's claims and sufficiency of the Complaint weighs in favor of default judgment.

21. Plaintiff CFTC has established that it will be prejudiced if default

judgment is not entered because it will be impeded from fulfilling its congressional

mandate to enforce the Act.

22. The relief Plaintiff CFTC seeks is reasonable, is authorized by the Act and
Regulations, and is consistent with awards in similar CFTC enforcement actions.

23. Defendants have not answered the Complaint, contested the facts alleged
in the Complaint, nor filed an opposition to the Motion for Default Judgment.
Accordingly, no dispute of material fact exists that would preclude entry of default
judgment.

24. There is no evidence before the Court demonstrating Defendants’ default
resulted from excusable neglect.

25. Accordingly, the CFTC’s Motion for Entry of Default Judgment,
Permanent Injunction, and Other Ancillary Equitable Relief against Defendants
Allensworth, E-Slate, Fusco, and Weddle is GRANTED. See Eitel v. McCool, 782
F.2d 1470 (9th Cir. 1986).

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT:

A. Permanent Injunction

26. The CFTC ts authorized to seek, and the Court to impose, injunctive relief.
See 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1(a); U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Comm’n v. Driver, 877 F.
Supp. 2d 968, 981 (C.D. Cal. 2012), aff'd sub nom. Commodity Futures Trading
Comm’n v. Driver, 585 F. App’x 366 (9th Cir. 2014).

27. The well-pleaded facts of the CFTC’s Complaint, and the evidence
submitted through declarations, establish that Defendants’ unlawful conduct makes it
highly likely that they will be repeat violators of the Act and Regulations unless
permanently restrained and enjoined by the Court.

28. Defendants’ fraudulent schemes spanned over four years and deprived at
least seventy-six victims of almost $3 million. Most of the victims were tax and
retirement planning clients, who believed they had a relationship of trust as to their

intimate financial details. Those victims and details were instead exploited.

outside of the commodity futures industry.

30. Based upon and in connection with the foregoing conduct, pursuant to
7 U.S.C. § 13a-1, Defendants Fusco and Weddle, and any other person or entity in

directly or indirectly engaging in conduct in violations of Sections 4b(a)(1)(A)-(C),

7 US.C. § 13a-1, Defendants Allensworth and E-Slate, and any other person or entity in
active concert with them, are permanently restrained, enjoined, and prohibited from
directly or indirectly engaging in conduct in violations of 7 U.S.C. §§ 6b(a)(1)(A)-(C),

B. Restitution

33. The CFTC is authorized to seek, and the Court to impose, equitable
remedies for violations of the Act. 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1(d)(3)(A). Those equitable
remedies include “restitution to persons who have sustained losses proximately caused
by such violations (in the amount of such losses).” Jd.

34. Defendants Allensworth, E-Slate, and Fusco’s illegal conduct caused DTG
pool participants to incur net losses totaling $268,000.00, which reflects the total funds
Allensworth, E-Slate, and Fusco fraudulently solicited ($360,500.00), minus the funds
returned to pool participants in order to conceal and prolong the scheme, or to induce
additional investments in the nature of a Ponzi scheme ($92,500.00). See Declaration of
Elsie Robinson (“Robinson Decl.”’), dated August 1, 2018 (Dkt. No. 64).

35. Defendants Allensworth, E-Slate, and Fusco shall pay, jointly and

28 U.S.C. § 1961 (2012).

36. Defendants Allensworth, E-Slate, and Weddle’s illegal conduct caused
JustInfo pool participants to incur net losses totaling $2,527,874.44, which reflects the
total funds Allensworth, E-Slate, and Weddle fraudulently solicited ($2,803,129.28),
minus the funds returned to pool participants in order to conceal and prolong the
scheme, or to induce additional investments in the nature of a Ponzi scheme
($275,254.84). See Robinson Decl.

37. Defendants Allensworth, E-Slate, and Weddle shall, jointly and severally,
pay restitution in the amount of two million, five hundred twenty seven thousand eight

immediately, post-judgment interest shall accrue on Restitution Obligation Il beginning
on the date of entry of this Order and shall be determined by using the Treasury Bill rate
prevailing on the date of entry of this Order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1961.

38. To effect payment of Restitution Obligation I and Restitution Obligation II
and the distribution of any restitution payments to the defrauded DTG Pool participants
or JustInfo Pool participants, the Court appoints the National Futures Association
(“NFA”) as Monitor (“Monitor”). The Monitor shall collect restitution payments from
Defendants Allensworth, E-Slate, Fusco, and Weddle and make distributions as set forth
below. Because the Monitor is acting as an officer of this Court in performing these
services, the NFA shall not be liable for any action or inaction arising from NFA’s
appointment as Monitor, other than actions involving fraud.

39. Defendants Allensworth, E-Slate, and Fusco shall make DTG Pool
participant Restitution Obligation I payments under this Order to the Monitor in the
name “DTG Pool/Allensworth, Fusco Restitution Fund.” Defendants Allensworth, E-
Slate, and Weddle shall make JustInfo Pool participant Restitution Obligation II

payments under this Order to the Monitor in the name “JustInfo Pool/Allensworth,

Weddle Restitution Fund.” All such Restitution Obligation I and IT payments shall be
sent by electronic funds transfer, or by U.S. postal money order, certified check, bank
cashier’s check, or bank money order, to the Office of Administration, National Futures
Association, 300 South Riverside Plaza, Suite 1800, Chicago, Hlinois 60606 under
cover letter that identifies the paying Defendant and the name and docket number of this
proceeding. The paying Defendant shall simultaneously transmit copies of the cover
letter and the form of payment to the Chief Financial Officer, Commodity Futures
Trading Commission, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street, NW, Washington D.C.
20581.

40. The Monitor shall oversee Restitution Obligation I and Restitution
Obligation II and shall have the discretion to determine the manner of distribution of
such funds in an equitable fashion to Defendants’ pool participants identified by the
CFTC, or may defer distribution until such time as the Monitor deems appropriate. In
the event that the amount of Restitution Obligation I and II payments to the Monitor are
of a de minimis nature such that the Monitor determines that the administrative cost of
making a distribution to eligible pool participants is impractical, the Monitor may, in its
discretion, treat such restitution payments as civil monetary penalty payments, which
the Monitor shall forward to the CFTC pursuant to the instructions for civil monetary
penalty payments set forth below.

41. Defendants shall cooperate with the Monitor as appropriate to provide such
information as the Monitor deems necessary and appropriate to identify Defendants’
pool participants to whom the Monitor, in its sole discretion, may determine to include
in any plan for distribution of any Restitution Obligation I and Restitution Obligation II
payments. Defendants shall execute any documents necessary to release funds that they
hold in any repository, bank, investment, or other financial institution, wherever
located, in order to make partial or total payment toward Restitution Obligation I or
Restitution Obligation II.

42. The Monitor shall provide the CFTC at the beginning of each calendar year

with a report detailing the disbursement of funds to Defendants’ pool participants
during the previous year. The Monitor shall transmit this report accompanied by a
cover letter identifying the name and docket number of this proceeding to the Chief
Financial Officer, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Three Lafayette Centre,
1155 21st Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20581.

43. The amounts payable to each pool participant shall not limit the ability of
any pool participant to prove that a greater amount is owed from Defendants or any
other person or entity, and nothing herein shall be construed in any way to limit or
abridge the rights of any pool participant that exist under state or common law.

44. Pursuant to Rule 71 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, each pool
participant of Defendants who suffered a loss is explicitly made an intended third-party
beneficiary of this Order and may seek to enforce this Order to obtain satisfaction of
any portion of Restitution Obligation I and Restitution Obligation II that has not been
paid by Defendants, to ensure continued compliance with any provision of this Order,
and to hold Defendants in contempt for any violations of any provision of this Order.

45. To the extent that any funds accrue to the U.S. Treasury for satisfaction of

with scienter, fraudulently solicited and misappropriated $2,803,129.28 during the

fabricated statements reflecting trading profits and avoiding pool participant withdrawal
demands by falsely claiming that the FCM holding the trading accounts was performing

Slate, and Weddle, are appropriate under the circumstances involved in each fraud.

§ 143.8(a)(4)(i1i1)(B).

51. Defendants Allensworth, E-Slate, and Fusco reaped net gains from their
fraud in the amount of $268,000.00, which reflects the total amount of funds they

returned to DTG pool participants ($92,500.00).

52. Defendants Allensworth, E-Slate, and Weddle reaped net gains from their
fraud in the amount of $2,527,874.44, which reflects the total amount of funds they
