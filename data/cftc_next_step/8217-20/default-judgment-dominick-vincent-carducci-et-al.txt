=< xX

CASTEL, U.S.D.J.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) filed the Complaint in this
action on September 9, 2019. (Docket # 3.) The CFTC filed affidavits of service stating that the
summons and complaint were personally served on defendant Dominick Carducci on October 5,
2019, and that Vos Capital Management, LLC (“Vos”) was served through an agent on September
13, 2019. (Docket # 10, 11.) Defendants have not appeared in this case, and on November 5,
2019, the Clerk of Court issued Certificates of Default as to both defendants. (Docket # 30, 31.)
The CFTC represents that on June 19, 2020, Carducci was sentenced in the District of South
Carolina to 24 months’ imprisonment and restitution totaling more than $900,000 in connection

with the same scheme that is the subject of this case. United States v. Carducci, 19 Cr. 469 (BHH)

 

(D.S.C.) (Docket # 55).
The CFTC moved for entry of default judgment on January 23, 2020. (Docket #
34.) Because defendants have not answered or appeared, the motion for entry of default judgment

is granted.
Case 1:19-cv-08351-PKC Document 45 Filed 06/23/20 Page 2 of 9

“It is an ‘ancient common law axiom’ that a defendant who defaults thereby admits
all ‘well-pleaded’ factual allegations contained in the complaint.” City of New York v. Mickalis
Pawn Shop, LLC, 645 F.3d 114, 137 (2d Cir. 2011) (quoting Vermont Teddy Bear Co. v. 1-800
Beargram Co., 373 F.3d 241, 246 (2d Cir. 2004)). The allegations of the Complaint are therefore
deemed to have been admitted by the defendants. Because the default amounts to an admission of
the Complaint’s allegations, the Court need not engaged in the fact-finding exercise proposed by
the CFTC.

As a consequence of defendants’ default, the following relief is ordered:

I. Permanent Injunctive Relief.

1. Pursuant to Section 6c of the Commodity Exchange Act (the “Act”), 7 U.S.C. §
13a-1 (2018), Carducci is permanently restrained, enjoined and prohibited from directly or
indirectly engaging in conduct in violations of Sections 4b(a)(2)(A)-(C), 40(1),
2(c)(2)(C)i)(1)(cc), and 4k(2) of the Act and Regulations 5.2(b) and 5.3(a)(2)(11).

2. Pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1 (2018), VOS Capital is
permanently restrained, enjoined and prohibited from directly or indirectly engaging in conduct in
violations of Sections 4b(a)(2)(A)-(C), 40(1), 2(c)(2)(C)ai)(1)(cc), and 4m(1) of the Act and
Regulations 5.2(b) and 5.3(a)(2)(1).

3. Defendants are permanently restrained, enjoined and prohibited from, directly or
indirectly:

a. Trading on or subject to the rules of any registered entity (as that term is
defined by Section 1a(40) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 1a(40) (2018));
b. Entering into any transactions involving “commodity interests” (as that

term is defined in Regulation 1.3(yy), 17 C.F.R. § 1.3(yy) (2019)), for
Case 1:19-cv-08351-PKC Document 45 Filed 06/23/20 Page 3 of 9

accounts held in the name of any Defendant or for accounts in which any
Defendant has a direct or indirect interest;

C. Having any commodity interests traded on any Defendant’s behalf;

d. Controlling or directing the trading for or on behalf of any other person or
entity, whether by power of attorney or otherwise, in any account involving
commodity interests;

€. Soliciting, receiving, or accepting any funds from any person for the
purpose of purchasing or selling of any commodity interests;

f. Applying for registration or claiming exemption from registration with the
Commission in any capacity, and engaging in any activity requiring such
registration or exemption from registration with the Commission except as
provided for in Regulation 4.14(a)(9), 17 C.F.R. § 4.14(a)(9) (2019); and

g. Acting as a principal (as that term is defined in Regulation 3.1(a), 17
C.F.R. § 3.1(a) (2019)), agent, or any other officer or employee of any
person registered, exempted from registration, or required to be registered
with the Commission except as provided for in Regulation 4.14(a)(9), 17
C.F.R. § 4.14(a)(Q9).

II. Restitution and Civil Monetary Penalties.

 

A. Restitution.
1. Pursuant to Section 6c(d)(3)(A) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1(d)(3)(A) (2018),
Carducci and VOS Capital shall pay, jointly and severally, restitution in the amount of $953,875

(the “Restitution Obligation”). Ifthe Restitution Obligation is not paid immediately, post-
judgment interest shall accrue on the Restitution Obligation beginning on the date of entry of this
Order and Default Judgment (this “Order’) and shall be determined by using the Treasury Bill rate
prevailing on the date of entry of this Order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1961.

2. To effect payment of the Restitution Obligation and the distribution of any
restitution payments to Defendants’ customers, the Court appoints the National Futures Association
(“NFA”) as Monitor (“Monitor”). The Monitor shall collect restitution payments from Defendants
and make distributions as set forth below. Because the Monitor is acting as an officer of this Court
in performing these services, NFA shall not be liable for any action or inaction arising from NFA’s
appointment as Monitor, other than actions involving fraud.

3. Defendants shall make Restitution Obligation payments, and any post-judgment
interest payments, under this Order to the Monitor in the name “Dominick Vincent Carducci and
VOS Capital Management, LLC — Restitution Fund” and shall send such Restitution Obligation
payments by electronic funds transfer, or by U.S. postal money order, certified check, bank
cashier’s check, or bank money order, to the Office of Administration, National Futures
Association, 300 South Riverside Plaza, Suite 1800, Chicago, Illinois 60606 under cover letter that
identifies the paying Defendants and the name and docket number of this proceeding. Defendants
shall simultaneously transmit copies of the cover letter and the form of payment to the Chief
Financial Officer, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st
Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20581.

4. The Monitor shall oversee the Restitution Obligation and shall have the discretion
to determine the manner of distribution of such funds in an equitable fashion to Defendants’ Pool
Participants identified by the Commission or may defer distribution until such time as the Monitor
deems appropriate. In the event that the amount of Restitution Obligation payments to the Monitor

are of a de minimis nature such that the Monitor determines that the administrative cost of making
Case T:19-cy-GQR8R351-PkKeE anrimernr JR Ever OB/FRIO Pane SS af a
Naw CANS atin ie WOR TU Ne LAPEER ER Sra? POESSD AA ASA cade Ae Po CALANS ao AR
u

a distribution to eligible pool participants is impractical, the Monitor may, in its discretion, treat
such restitution payments as civil monetary penalty payments, which the Monitor shall forward to
the Commission following the instructions for civil monetary penalty payments set forth in Section
II.B below.

5. Defendants shall cooperate with the Monitor as appropriate to provide such
information as the Monitor deems necessary and appropriate to identify Defendants’ Pool
Participants to whom the Monitor, in its sole discretion, may determine to include in any plan for
distribution of any Restitution Obligation payments. Defendants shall execute any documents
necessary to release funds that they have in any repository, bank, investment or other financial
institution, wherever located, in order to make partial or total payment toward the Restitution
Obligation.

6. The Monitor shall provide the Commission at the beginning of each calendar year
with a report detailing the disbursement of funds to Defendants’ Pool Participants during the
previous year. The Monitor shall transmit this report under a cover letter that identifies the name
and docket number of this proceeding to the Chief Financial Officer, Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20581, and David
W. MacGregor, Chief Trial Attorney, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 140 Broadway,
19th Floor, New York, NY 10005.

7. The amounts payable to each Pool Participant shall not limit the ability of any
participant from proving that a greater amount is owed from Defendants or any other person or
entity, and nothing herein shall be construed in any way to limit or abridge the rights of any

customer that exist under state or common law.
Case 1:19-cv-08351-PKC Document 45 Filed 06/23/20 Page 6 of 9

8. Pursuant to FRCP 71, each Pool Participant who suffered a loss is explicitly made
an intended third-party beneficiary of this Order and may seek to enforce obedience of this Order to
obtain satisfaction of any portion of the restitution that has not been paid by Defendants to ensure
continued compliance with any provision of this Order and to hold Defendants in contempt for any
violations of any provision of this Order.

9. To the extent that any funds accrue to the U.S. Treasury for satisfaction of
Defendants’ Restitution Obligation, such funds shall be transferred to the Monitor for disbursement
in accordance with the procedures set forth above.

10. Defendants will obtain a dollar-for-dollar credit against this Restitution Obligation
as a result of any restitution payments made by Carducci in connection with the case captioned

United States v. Carducci, 19 Cr. 469 (BHH) (D.S.C.).

 

B. — Civil Monetary Penalty.

11. Pursuant to Section 6c(d)(1)(A) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1(d)(1)(A) (2018),
Defendants shall, jointly and severally, pay a civil monetary penalty in the amount of $2,861,625
(the “CMP Obligation’), which is equivalent to triple the monetary gain to Defendants from their
violations—1.e., three times the gross amount of Pool Participant funds obtained by Defendants less
the amount of funds returned to Pool Participants. If the CMP Obligation is not paid immediately,
then post-judgment interest shall accrue on the CMP Obligation beginning on the date of entry of
this Order and shall be determined by using the Treasury Bill rate prevailing on the date of entry of
this Order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1961.

12. Defendants shall pay their CMP Obligation by electronic funds transfer, U.S.

postal money order, certified check, bank cashier’s check, or bank money order. If payment is to
Case 1:19-cv-08351-PKC Document 45 Filed 06/23/20 Page 7 of 9

be made other than by electronic funds transfer, then the payment shall be made payable to the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission and sent to the address below:

Oklahoma City, OK 73169

(405) 954-6569 office

If payment by electronic funds transfer is chosen, Defendants shall contact Marie

comply with those instructions. Defendants shall accompany payment of the CMP Obligation
with a cover letter that identifies the paying Defendant and the name and docket number of this
proceeding.

payment to the Chief Financial Officer, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Three
Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20581, and David W. MacGregor,
Chief Trial Attorney, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 140 Broadway, 19th Floor, New
York, NY 10005.

III. Miscellaneous Provisions.

 

1. Acceptance by the Commission or the Monitor of any partial payment of
Defendants’ Restitution Obligation or CMP Obligation shall not be deemed a waiver of their
obligation to make further payments pursuant to this Order, or a waiver of the Commission’s
right to seek to compel payment of any remaining balance.

2. The injunctive and equitable relief provisions of this Order shall be binding upon

Defendants, upon any person under the authority or control of any Defendant, and upon any
