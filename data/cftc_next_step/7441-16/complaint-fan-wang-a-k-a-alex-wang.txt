U.S. COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING
COMMISSION,

Plaintiff, COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND
OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF AND
CIVIL MONETARY PENALTIES

V. UNDER THE COMMODITY
EXCHANGE ACT

FAN WANG a.k.a. ALEX WANG,

Defendant.

 

 

Plaintiff U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“Commission’’) alleges as
follows:

I. SUMMARY

1. On November 16, 2011 (the “Relevant Date’), Defendant Fan Wang a.k.a. Alex
Wang (“Wang”), an employee of Company A at the time, knowingly made multiple manual false
entries in Company A’s computerized trading records relating to his purchases of certain light
sweet crude oil futures contracts (“crude oil futures”) for a Company A proprietary trading
account that same day. These manual entries in Company A’s computerized trading records
constituted false reports in connection with contracts of sale of a commodity in interstate
commerce for future delivery, made on or subject to the rules of a designated contract market, for
or on behalf of any other person, in violation of Section 4b(a)(1)(B) of the Commodity Exchange

Act (“Act”), 7 U.S.C. § 6b(a)(1)(B) (2012).
2. Pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1 (2012), the Commission
brings this action to enjoin Wang’s unlawful acts and practices, to compel his compliance with
the Act, and to further enjoin him from engaging in certain commodity-related activities.

3. In addition, the Commission seeks civil monetary penalties, restitution, and
remedial ancillary relief, including but not limited to, trading and registration bans and such

other relief as the Court may deem necessary or appropriate.

I. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1 (2012), authorizes the Commission to
seek injunctive and other relief against any person whenever it appears to the Commission that
such person has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a
violation of any provision of the Act or any rule, regulation, or order thereunder.

5. Pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1(e) (2012), venue properly
lies with the Court, because Wang transacted business in this district and his acts and practices

alleged in this Complaint occurred within this district.

Il. THE PARTIES

6. Plaintiff U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an independent
federal regulatory agency charged by Congress with the administration and enforcement of the
Act, 7 U.S.C. §§ 1 et seg. (2012), and the Commission Regulations promulgated thereunder, 17
C.F.R. §§ 1.1 et seg. (2016).

7. Defendant Fan Wang a.k.a. Alex Wang is a Chinese national who, upon
information and belief, currently resides in Short Hills, New Jersey. At all relevant times
including the Relevant Date, Wang was a clerk and assistant trader at Company A. Wang
worked at Company A’s offices in New York, New York. Wang has never been registered with

the Commission in any capacity.
IV. OTHER RELEVANT ENTITY
8. Company A is a New York limited liability company with its principal place of

business in New York, New York. Company A is a financial services firm that engages in
proprietary trading of futures, options, and energy derivatives. Company A is owned by
Company B. At all relevant times including the Relevant Date, Company B was a New York
entity. Company A has never been registered with the Commission in any capacity. Company B
has been a registered introducing broker since December 2009.

V. FACTS

9. On the Relevant Date, Wang purchased 587 crude oil futures contracts for a
Company A proprietary trading account through the CME Group’s (“CME”) Globex electronic
trading platform.

10. Of the 587 crude oil futures contracts Wang purchased on the Relevant Date, at
least 300 contracts created open futures positions for Company A.

11. Later that same day, Wang intentionally made multiple manual false entries in
Company A’s computerized trading records that disguised the status of at least 300 of the 587
crude oil futures contracts he purchased, making it appear that the positions had been closed out
when in fact they had not been closed out.

12. Another portion of the 587 crude oil futures contracts that Wang purchased on the
Relevant Date closed out existing open futures positions, and multiple manual false entries that
Wang made in Company A’s computerized trading records that same day disguised the fact that
Wang had made those purchases.

13. Wang knew at the time he made the manual entries in Company A’s

computerized trading records that the entries were false.
Case 1:16-cv-06961 Documenti1 Filed 09/06/16 Page 4 of 7

14. Wang knew at the time he made the false entries in Company A’s computerized
trading records that making such false entries was illegal.

15. On July 24, 2014, in a court in this District, Wang pled guilty to one count of
making a false report in connection with a commodities transaction in violation of Section
4b(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 6b(a)(1)(B) (2012), based on substantially the same facts as
alleged above. United States v. Wang, Case No. 1:14-cr-00411 (S.D.N.Y. Jul. 16, 2014) (ECF
No. 16).

FALSE REPORTS IN CONNECTION WITH COMMODITY FUTURES
TRANSACTIONS
Violations of 7 U.S.C. § 6b(a)(1)(B) (2012)

16. Paragraphs | through 15 of this Complaint are re-alleged and incorporated herein
by reference.

17. Section 4b(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 6b(a)(1)(B) (2012), in relevant part,
makes it unlawful for any person, in or in connection with any order to make, or the making of,
any contract of sale of any commodity in interstate commerce or for future delivery that is made,
or to be made, on or subject to the rules of a designated contract market, for or on behalf of any
other person willfully to make or cause to be made to the other person any false report or
statement or willfully to enter or cause to be entered for the other person any false record.

18. As alleged above, on the Relevant Date Wang violated Section 4b(a)(1)(B) of the

Act, 7 U.S.C. § 6b(a)(1)(B) (2012), by willfully making multiple false reports, or by willfully

entering multiple false records, in Company A’s computerized trading records in connection with

587 crude oil futures contracts that he purchased for a Company A proprietary trading account
that same day.

19. Specifically, as alleged above, on the Relevant Date Wang intentionally made
multiple manual entries in Company A’s computerized trading records that disguised the 587
crude oil futures contracts he purchased, including the open position for Company A that Wang
created from some of those purchases.

20. Each of these manual entries Wang made in Company A’s computerized trading
records on the Relevant Date constituted a false report in connection with a commodity
transaction in violation of Section 4b(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 6b(a)(1)(B) (2012).

21. Each false report in connection with a commodity transaction made on the
Relevant Date is alleged as a separate and distinct violation of Section 4b(a)(1)(B) of the Act,

7 U.S.C. § 6b(a)(1)(B) (2012).
