ORDER DETERMINING WHISTLEBLOWER AWARD CLAIMS

 

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“Commission”) received whistleblower award claims
from = Claimant 1"), Peete (Claimant 2"), Sowa (Claimant 3”),
Radaciod (“Claimant 4"), and ®°*— (CHaimant 5") (collectively “Claimants”), in

response to Notice of Covered Action """“** regarding Redecse Rodactes

’
a Redacted ” or “Order"),

The Claims Review Staff (“CRS”) evaluated each claim in accordance with the Commission’s
Whistleblower Rules (“‘Rules"), 17 C.F.R. pt. 165 (2017) (as amended by 82 Fed. Reg. 24,487, 24,496—
521 (May 30, 2017), promulgated pursuant to Section 23 of the Commodity Exchange Act ("CEA” or
“Act"), 7 U.S.C, § 26 (2012).

On February 12, 2018, the CRS issued a Preliminary Determination recommending that Claimant
1 receive a whistleblower award in the amount of 227% of the monetary sanctions collected in the &

+ The Preliminary Determination also recommended denying the remaining award
claims of Claimant 2, Claimant 3, Claimant 4, and Claimant 5, because their claims did not meet the
tequirements of the CEA and the Rules.

Claimant 1 met all the requirements under the CEA and Rules for an award, because Claimant 1
is a whistleblower who voluntarily provided original information to the Commission that led to the

successful enforcement of a covered action. See 7 U.S.C. § 26(b)(1)(2012); 17 C.P.R. §§ 165.1, 165.5,
PUBLIC VERSION

Claimant 1 also satisfied the eligibility requirements for an award, See 17 C.F.R. §§ 165.5, 165.6.
Claimant 1 submitted a Form TCR, voluntarily provided original information, and provided assistance to
Commission staff during the course of the investigation. Moreover, Claimant | does not fall into any of
the categories of individuals ineligible for an award. See 17 C.F.R. § 165.6.

The Rules justify awarding Claimant | &% of the monetary sanctions collected.' Claimant I's
information was specific, timely, and credible, and caused Commission staff to launch an investigation.

Rednasd . The Division was

Claimant 1’s information was essential to the success of the
unaware of the violations before Claimant | provided information regarding them. Claimant 1 was
extensively involved in the investigation, and was truthfut, forthcoming, and cooperative. Claimant 1's
willingness to provide the Commission with ongoing, extensive, and timely assistance conserved
Commission resources, Moreover, the Commission has significant programmatic and law enforcement
interests in ensuring that Recacted . Granting an award to
Claimant 1 will incentivize whistleblowers to report Redacted

« It would also provide notice to market participants that individuals are
reporting quality information about violations of the CEA, thereby enhancing the Commission’s ability to
enforce the CBA.

 

‘For whistleblowers eligible to receive an award, Rule 165.9 contains the factors that influence the percentage
amount ofan award that the whistleblower receives, including factors to be taking Into consideration, factors that
may increase the amount of'a whistleblower’s award, and factors that may decrease the amount ofa whistleblower’s
award, See 17 C.F.R, § 165.9.
PUBLIC VERSION

The CEA and the Rules do not require that the calculation of the award amount to be
based solely on the monetary sanctions collected by the Commission. The specific phrase
“collected by the Commission” is used in Section 23(g)(3)(A) of the CEA and Rule
§ 165.12(b)(1) when discussing deposits and credits into the Commission's Customer Protection
Fund. See 7 U.S.C § 26(g)(3)(A); 17 C.F.R. § 165.12(b)( 1). However, when discussing the
calculation of a whistleblower award, the CEA and the Rules use the phrase “what has been
collected of the monetary sanctions Imposed in the covered judicial or administrative action or
related action.” See 7 U.S.C, § 26(b); 17 C.F.R. § 165.8. Unlike the language used in subsection
(g}(3) of the CBA and subsection 165.12(b)(1) of the Rules, this language does not require that
the monetary sanctions be specifically collected by the Commission. Additionally, the CEA and
the Rules broadly define “monetary sanctions” with respect to any judicial or administrative
action to include “any monies, including penalties, disgorgement ..., ordered to be pald.” 7
U.S.C. § 26(a)(3)(A); 17 C.F.R. § 165.2G)(1) (emphasis added). Again, the requirement is only

that these sanctions are “ordered to be paid” by the Commission; not directly collected by the

Commission.

 

2 The phrase “collected by the Commission" is defined in 17 CF.R. § 165.2(d) to refer to any funds received, and
confirmed by the U.S, Department of the Treasury, in satisfaction of part or all ofa civil monetary penalty,
disgorgement obligation, or fine owned to the Commission.”

None of the Claimants responded to the Preliminary Determination. Pursuant to Rule 165.7(h),
17 C.B.R. § 165.7(h), the Preliminary Determination becomes final because Claimants 2 - 5 failed to
submit a timely response contesting the Preliminary Determination, which constitutes a failure to exhaust
administrative remedies. Accordingly, Claimants are prohibited from pursuing an appeal under Rule
165.13, 17 CBR. § 165.13.

It is hereby ORDERED that Claimant | shall receive %%'% of the monetary sanctions collected in
a

the Rodaci 3 and it is further ORDERED that the award claims of Claimant 2, Claimant 3,

Claimant 4, and Claimant 5 be, and hereby are, denied.
