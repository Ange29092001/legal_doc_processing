I. INTRODUCTION

1. From at least August 2017 through December 2019 (the “Relevant Period’),
Defendant Michael Ackerman (““Ackerman’’) and the entities he founded, Defendant Q3
Holdings, LLC (“Q3H”), and Defendant Q3 I, LP (“Q3I,” and together with Q3H, “Q3”),
operated a fraudulent scheme in which they solicited and misappropriated funds to purportedly
trade virtual currencies. Based on Ackerman’s and Q3’s (collectively “Defendants’’) fraudulent
misrepresentations, more than 150 individuals and entities (“Q3 customers’) deposited at least
$33 million with Q3. However, less than $10 million of the $33 million in Q3 customer funds
was wired to virtual currency exchanges.

2. Instead, Defendants transferred more than $25 million of Q3 customers’ funds to
personal bank accounts of Ackerman and the two other individuals with whom Ackerman

founded Q3. Ackerman himself received more than $7 million of Q3 customers’ funds.
Mase P:20-cv-OL183 Document 1 Filed G2/E1/20 Page 2 af is

3. To entice potential Q3 customers to invest in their scheme, Defendants knowingly
and falsely represented that they were profitably trading virtual currencies earning monthly
returns of approximately 15%.

4. Despite Defendants’ representations to potential and existing Q3 customers that
their virtual currency trading was highly successful and that Q3 customers were free to withdraw
the profits earned in their accounts after one year, Defendants did not trade virtual currencies
successfully and most Q3 customers’ money was misappropriated or lost trading.

5. To conceal their fraud, Defendants and the other Q3 founders provided Q3
customers with false accounting statements, newsletters containing false trading returns, and
fictitious screenshots reflecting the amount of money under Q3’s management.

6. Through this conduct, Defendants were engaged, are engaging, or are about to
engage in fraudulent acts and practices in violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (“Act”), 7
U.S.C. §§ 1-26 (2018), and the Commission’s Regulations (“Regulations”), 17 C.F.R. pts. 1-190
(2019), specifically, Section 6(c)(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 9(1) (2018), and Regulation 180.1(a),
17 C_F.R. § 180.1(a)(2019)

7. Accordingly, pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1 (2018), the
Commission brings this action to enjoin such acts and practices and compel compliance with the
Act and the Regulations. In addition, the Commission seeks civil monetary penalties and
remedial ancillary relief including, but not limited to, trading and registration bans, restitution,
disgorgement, rescission, pre- and post-judgment interest, and such other relief as the Court may

deem necessary and appropriate.

8. Unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, Defendants are likely to continue to
engage in the acts and practices alleged in this Complaint and similar acts and practices, as more
fully described below.

Il. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

 

9. Jurisdiction. This Court has jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C. § 1331
(2012) (codifying federal question jurisdiction) and 28 U.S.C. § 1345 (2012) (providing that U.S.
district courts have original jurisdiction over civil actions commenced by the United States or by
any agency expressly authorized to sue by Act of Congress). In addition, Section 6c(a) of the
Act, 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1(a) (2018), provides that district courts have jurisdiction to hear actions
brought by the Commission for injunctive relief or to enforce compliance with the Act whenever
it shall appear to the Commission that any person has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage
in, an act or practice constituting a violations of any provision of the Act or any rule, regulation,
or order thereunder.

10. Venue. Venue properly lies with the Court pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act, 7
U.S.C. § 13a-1(e) (2018), because Defendants are found in, inhabit, or transact business in this
District, and because acts and practices in violations of the Act occurred, are occurring, or are
about to occur, within this District. As alleged in this complaint, Defendants fraudulently
transacted business in the District. Specifically, Defendants used a bank in the District to deposit
and transfer customer funds and a trading exchange in the District to trade virtual currencies.

I. THE PARTIES
11. Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“Commission” or

“CFTC’”) is an independent federal regulatory agency that is charged by Congress with the
Mase P:20-cv-OL183 Document. Filed G2/E1/20 Page 4 af is

administration and enforcement of the Act and the Regulations. The Commission maintains its
principal office at Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street, NW, Washington, DC 20581.

12. Defendant Q3 Holdings, LLC is a limited liability company formed in Delaware
on April 10, 2018. Q3H’s last known address is 1994 Carolina Circle NE, St. Petersburg,
Florida. Q3H has never been registered with the Commission.

13. Defendant Q3 I, LP is a limited partnership formed in Delaware on July 27, 2018.
Q3lI’s last known address is1994 Carolina Circle NE, St. Petersburg, Florida. Q3I has never
been registered with the Commission.

14. Defendant Michael Ackerman is a resident of Alliance, Ohio. Ackerman was
primarily responsible for the trading at Q3. Ackerman has never been registered with the
Commission.

IV. STATUTORY BACKGROUND

 

15. Virtual currencies, like those Q3 purported to trade on behalf of its customers, are
encompassed in the definition of “commodity” under Section 1a(9) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 1a(9)
(2018). For the purposes of this Complaint, a virtual currency means a digital representation of
value that functions as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and/or a store of value, but does
not have legal tender status in any jurisdiction. Virtual currencies are distinct from “real”
currencies, which are the coin and paper money of the United States or another country that are
designated as legal tender, circulate, and are customarily used and accepted as a medium of
exchange in the country of issuance. Virtual currencies typically use cryptographic protocols to
secure transactions in that asset and use decentralized networks to track transactions between
persons who are denominated only by publicly visible strings of characters. The transactions are

captured in single blocks at a time, which independent operators (called “miners,” a virtual
Mase P:20-cv-O1L183 Document 1 Filed G2/E1/20 Page 5 af 45

analogy to actual miners whose efforts unearth gold, silver, and other precious metals) confirm
by performing algorithmic proofs of work and for which they are usually awarded a sum of the
virtual currency in question. The public nature of the decentralized ledger allows people to
recognize the transfer of virtual currency from one user to another without requiring any central
intermediary in which both users need to trust.

V. FACTS

A. Operation of Q3

16. In early 2017, Ackerman and the other Q3 founders opened a virtual currency
trading account at a cryptocurrency exchange known as Kraken (the “Kraken account’).

17. The Kraken account was initially funded with a combined $15,000 from
Ackerman and the other Q3 founders, and Ackerman was responsible for the virtual currency
trading in the account.

18. In or around July 2017, Ackerman and the other Q3 founders began to solicit
family and friends to trade virtual currencies.

19. To open an “account” with Q3, Q3 customers sent funds to the personal bank
account of a Q3 founder, or Q3’s bank account, where the funds were in turn transferred to a
cryptocurrency exchange virtual currency account purportedly traded by Ackerman.

20. Q3 had virtual currency trading accounts at cryptocurrency exchanges Kraken,
Gemini, Coinbase, and Bitfinex.

21. In these Q3 virtual currency trading accounts, Ackerman was purportedly using

an algorithm he had created to trade various virtual currencies.
Mase P:20-cv-O1L183 Document. Filed G2/11/20 Page 6 af 15

22. Q3 sustained a substantial trading loss in August 2017, after which Ackerman told
the other Q3 founders that he needed to change his trading strategy. As a result, the other Q3
founders agreed to change the fund’s trading strategy and informed Q3’s existing customers.

23. After Ackerman implemented his purported new trading strategy using an
algorithm he created, he reported to the other Q3 founders that his virtual currency trading was
highly successful, averaging monthly trading returns of approximately 15%.

B. Defendants Made False and Misleading Representations, and
Omitted Material Facts, To Solicit Q3 Customers

 

 

24. During the Relevant Period, Defendants and other Q3 founders told prospective
and existing Q3 customers that Q3’s virtual currency trading was consistently profitable and that
Q3’s money under management continued to grow.

25. During the Relevant Period, Defendants and other Q3 founders sent Q3 customers
fraudulent account statements that contained fictitious account balances and monthly totals.

26. During the Relevant Period, Defendants and other Q3 founders presented
prospective and existing Q3 customers with fraudulent screenshots of Q3’s purported trading.
These fraudulent screenshots indicated that Q3’s crypto currency trading accounts had grown to
more than $200 million. In truth, Q3’s primary crypto currency trading account never had more
than $6 million.

27. During the Relevant Period, Defendants and other Q3 founders fraudulently
misrepresented to prospective and existing Q3 customers that the money in the Q3 trading
account was secure because no one person could withdraw or transfer money from the Q3
trading account without the consent of one or more of the other founders.

28. During the Relevant Period, Defendants and other Q3 founders fraudulently

misrepresented to prospective and existing Q3 customers that the money in the Q3 trading
Mase P:20-cv-OL183 Document. Filed G2/11/20 Page 7 af 15

account was safe because 70% of the funds in the trading account were kept in cash at all times

and only 30% was used to trade.

29.

During the Relevant Period, Defendants knowingly made the following false and

fraudulent statements and material omissions to prospective and existing Q3 customers to

conceal Defendants’ fraudulent scheme:

a)

b)

c)

d)

g)

h)

1)

“On average we make about 0.5% daily on invested income. Yes you read that
correctly. And that amount is compounded continuously as profit is made.”
“[W]e can offer tremendous returns of roughly 15% a month with precise and
limited risk.”

“We make roughly 13-15% total profit for each month. This has been a consistent
pattern over the last six months.”

“Profits are continuously reinvested thus compounding continuously. These
returns have been consistent since August 2017.”

“There are a few costs of operations (minor salaries, an office, licensing fees and
other costs).”

“The algos are right about 75% of the time and wrong 25%. So we make much
more money than we lose.”

“It’s much less risky than buying and holding a coin that could go to zero.”
“Luckily the algos are correct in predicting the direction of momentum for a coin
75% of the time — [ll take that in Vegas any day. We end up losing on 1 of 4
trades. Nets us positive everyday.”

“In fact we haven’t had a negative day in 6 months!”
Mase P:20-cv-O1L183 Document. Filed G2/E1/20 Page Batis

j) “[Bly having a mathematically guaranteed loss ratio that is below 25%, we can
guarantee winning trades as long as there is volatility in the marketplace.”

k) “[W]e have mathematically determined a strategy that allows us to gain more than
we lose in an any life cycle.”

1) “We continue to remain spot on with our programming, continual enhancements
and ratio goals. What started out with an eye towards a great way to make a little
money has quickly manifested into a longer-term proposition.”

m) “It’s been a winning strategy that has been tested through every peak and trough
of this market over the last two years without failing.”

n) “Algorithms are managed 24/7 by our chief trading officer, Michael Ackerman.”

C. Defendants Misappropriated Q3 Customers’ Funds

 

30. During the Relevant Period, Defendants received in excess of approximately $33
million from more than 150 Q3 customers.

31. During the Relevant Period, Defendants misappropriated a substantial majority of
the Q3 customers’ funds for improper and unauthorized uses, such as to wrongfully enrich
themselves through the purchase of homes, cars, and other luxury items.

32. Ackerman misappropriated approximately $7.4 million for himself, and used
these funds to purchase several homes, among other things.

33. During the Relevant Period, Defendants directed Q3 customers to transfer funds
into bank accounts controlled by or operated for the benefit of Defendants.

34. For instance, Defendants instructed Q3 customers to transfer funds into a bank

account held in the name Q3 at Signature Bank.
Mase P:20-cv-OL183 Document. Filed G2/21/20 Page 9 af is

35. Upon receipt, or very soon thereafter, these customer funds were transferred to
other accounts controlled by Ackerman or other Q3 founders, where the money was
misappropriated by Defendants.

36. To the extent any Q3 customers received any purported investment redemptions
from the Defendants, those purported redemptions actually consisted of funds that Defendants
misappropriated from other Q3 customers, in the nature of a Ponzi scheme.

37. For example, on October 1, 2019, Q3 held $873,000 in its Q3I account and
$1,996,457.11 in its Q3H accounts at Signature Bank. Then in early October 2019, Q3 received
a redemption request for $3,000,000 from existing Q3 Customer A.

38. To meet Customer A’s $3,000,000 redemption request, Q3 transferred
approximately $996,000 of other Q3 customer funds from Q3’s trading account at a virtual-
currency exchange to its Q3 I, LP bank account at Signature Bank, from which Customer A’s
$3,000,000 redemption request was paid.

39. Additionally, from October 1, 2019, through October 2, 2019, Q3 received new
funds from five customers totaling $797,000. Q3 deposited these new funds into its Signature
Bank account.

40. Then on October 2, 2019, Defendants wired $500,000 to Ackerman and
$517,767.16 to the other Q3 founders from the Q3 Signature Bank account.

C. Ackerman Was a Controlling Person of Q3

 

Al. Ackerman was a controlling person of Q3. Ackerman was a founder of Q3 and
had trading authority over the Q3 trading accounts. Ackerman also created the algorithm that Q3

used to conduct the limited trading it did and Ackerman prepared reports and statements centered
Case b2O-cv-O1183 Documenti Filed O2/11/20 Page 1O of 15

on his trading that were given to Q3 customers. Ackerman also had the ability to hire, fire, and
set salaries for certain employees at Q3.

D. Ackerman Acted as an Agent for Q3

 

42. Through his solicitation of potential and existing Q3 customers, his active
marketing of Q3 by providing information regarding his trading of the Q3 accounts, and his
cryptocurrency trading, Ackerman acted as an agent of Q3.
