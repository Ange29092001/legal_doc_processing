Case 2:16-cv-07358 Documenti Filed 09/30/16 Page 2 of 39 Page ID #:2

Plaintiff, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”), by and
through its attorneys, alleges as follows:

I. SUMMARY

1. Since at least October 2011, and continuing through the present (the
“Relevant Period”), Defendants United Business Servicing, LLC (“UBS LLC”),
doing business as SchoolofTrade.com (“SoT”) and United Business Servicing, Inc.
(“UBS Inc.”), as successor in interest to UBS LLC, and doing business as SoT, by
and through the actions of their employees and agents, including but not limited to
Defendant Joseph Dufresne (“Dufresne”), also known as Joseph James, and
Defendant Megan Renkow, also known as Megan James (collectively,
Defendants”), have engaged and continue to engage in the fraudulent promotion
of trading strategies and systems to be used for the trading of commodity futures
contracts on or subject to the rules of designated contract markets.

2. To carry out their fraud, Defendants have engaged, and continue to
engage, in a systematic pattern of material false statements and omissions in
connection with the marketing of SoT’s trading strategies and systems. Each and
every material misrepresentation and omission made by Defendants was made with
knowledge, or with reckless disregard for the fact, that it was false and misleading.

3. SoT sells various levels of “memberships” that allow clients varying

degrees of access to SoT’s trading strategies and to SoT’s “Live Trade Room.”

These memberships range in price from $249.99 per month for a Beginning
Membership to a one-time payment of $4,999 for a lifetime Advanced
Membership. During the Relevant Period, SoT has sold approximately 877
memberships and has taken in approximately $2,776,994. On information and
belief, SoT continues to take in additional revenue from ongoing sales of
memberships.

4, To sell memberships, Defendants have made, and continue to make,
material false and misleading statements, and have omitted, and continue to omit,
material information concerning: a) the professional experience and trading
success of Dufresne; b) the profitability and performance record of SoT’s trading
strategies and systems; and c) the actual nature of the trading activity purporting to
take place during SoT’s “Live Trade Room.”

5. In addition, Defendants have failed to display prominently in their
solicitation material certain required disclosure statements concerning simulated or
hypothetical trading results, and client testimonials.

6. By virtue of this conduct, and the conduct further described herein,
Defendants have violated, and continue to violate Section 40 of the Commodity
Exchange Act (the “Act”), 7 U.S.C. § 60(1) (2012), and CFTC Regulations

(“Regulations”) 4.41(a) and (b), 17 C.F.R. §§ 4.41(a) and (b) (2016).

Case 2:16-cv-07358 Documenti Filed 09/30/16 Page 4o0f 39 Page ID #:4

7. During the Relevant Period, Dufresne and Renkow are officers,
employees, or agents of UBS LLC and UBS Inc. Therefore, pursuant to 7 U.S.C. §
2(a)(1)(B) (2012) and 17 C.F.R. § 1.2 (2016), UBS, LLC and UBS Inc. are liable
for the acts and omissions of Dufresne and Renkow that violated the Act and
Regulations.

8. During the Relevant Period, Dufresne and Renkow are controlling
persons of UBS LLC and UBS Inc. who have not acted, and are not acting in good
faith, or who have knowingly induced, and are knowingly inducing, directly or
indirectly, the acts and omissions constituting UBS LLC’s and UBS Inc.’s
violations of the Act and Regulations. Therefore, pursuant to 7 U.S.C. § 13c(b)
(2012), Dufresne and Renkow are liable for UBS LLC’s and UBS Inc.’s violations
of the Act and Regulations.

9. Unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, Defendants will likely
continue to engage in the acts and practices alleged in this Complaint, or in similar
acts and practices, as described more fully below.

10. Accordingly, pursuant to 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1 (2012), the CFTC brings
this action to enjoin Defendants’ unlawful acts and practices, to compel their
compliance with the Act and Regulations, and to enjoin them from engaging in any
commodity-related activity. In addition, the CFTC seeks civil monetary penalties,

restitution, and remedial ancillary relief, including, but not limited to, trading and

and further relief as the Court may deem necessary and appropriate.
II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

11. The Court has jurisdiction of this action pursuant to 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1,
which provides that, whenever it shall appear to the CFTC that any person has
engaged in, is engaging in, or is about to engage in any act or practice that
constitutes a violation of any provision of the Act or any rule, regulation, or order
promulgated thereunder, the CFTC may bring an action against such person to
enjoin such practice or to enforce compliance with the Act or Regulations.

12. Venue properly lies with this Court pursuant to 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1(e),
because Defendants are found in, inhabit, or transact business in this District, or
the acts and practices in violation of the Act and Regulations occurred, are
occurring, or are about to occur within this District, among other places.

IV. STATUTORY BACKGROUND

18. 7U.S.C. § 1a(6) (2012) defines a Commodity Trading Adviser
(“CTA”) as any person who, for compensation or profit, engages in the business of
advising others, either directly or through publications, writings, or electronic
media, as to the value of or the advisability of trading in any contract of sale of a
commodity for future delivery made or to be made on or subject to the rules of a
contract market.

19. 7U.S.C. § 60(1) makes it unlawful for a CTA, by use of the mails or
any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, directly or indirectly (A) to
employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud any client or customer or
prospective client or customer; or (B) to engage in any transaction, practice, or
course of business which operates as a fraud or deceit upon any client or
prospective client.

20. 17C.F.R. § 4.41(a)(1)-(2) makes it unlawful for a CTA, or any
principal thereof, to advertise in a manner which (1) employs any device, scheme

or artifice to defraud client or prospective client; or (2) involves any transaction,

practice, or course of business which operates as a fraud or deceit upon any client
or prospective client.

21. 17C.F.R. § 4.41(a)(3)G)-(i) makes it unlawful for a CTA, or any
principal thereof, to advertise in a manner which refers to any testimonial, unless
the advertisement or sales literature providing the testimonial prominently
discloses, among other things, that: (1) the testimonial may not be representative of
the experience of other clients; and (2) the testimonial is no guarantee of future
performance or success.

22. 17 C.F.R. § 4.41(b) provides that no person may present the
performance of any simulated or hypothetical commodity interest account,
transaction in a commodity interest or series of transactions in a commodity
interest of a CTA, or any principal thereof, unless such performance is
accompanied by the following prescribed statement:

These results are based on simulated or hypothetical performance

results that have certain inherent limitations. Unlike the results shown

in an actual performance record, these results do not represent actual

trading. Also, because these trades have not actually been executed,

these results may have under-or-over-compensated for the impact, if
any, of certain market factors, such as liquidity. Simulated or

hypothetical trading programs in general are also subject to the fact

 
Case 2:16-cv-07358 Document1 Filed 09/30/16 Page 9of39 Page ID #:9

1 that they are designed with the benefit of hindsight. No representation

2 is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or
losses similar to these being shown.

5 || The Regulation further provides that if the presentation is other than oral, the

6 prescribed statement must be prominently disclosed and in immediate proximity to
4

the simulated or hypothetical performance being presented.
Vv. FACTS

10}/ A. Defendants’ Operation of SoT

11

1 23. Renkow formed UBS LLC in Delaware in February 2008. She is

13]| listed as the sole Member on UBS LLC’s formation papers, although in a

1411 document executed in September 2008, and again in a similar document in June
15
16 2009, Renkow confirmed that Dufresne was an officer of the company and had full

17]|| access to company accounts and full authority over the operations of the company.

18 24. The SoT website (www.schooloftrade.com) first appeared in or about
. late 2008. The website at that time listed UBS LLC as the parent company of SoT.
21 25. UBS Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in July 2011. In November
22 201 1, Renkow registered UBS Inc. as a foreign corporation in California.

. According to UBS Inc.’s California corporation records, Renkow is the President,

25|| Chief Executive Officer, Secretary, and Chief Financial Officer of UBS Inc. Ina

document dated January 2012, Renkow stated that she is the “sole 100% owner of
all shares and interest in United Business Servicing Inc.”

26. As late as January 2012, UBS LLC continued to be listed as the parent
company on the SoT website; however, sometime between January 2012 and
March 2012, the SoT website was changed to reflect UBS Inc. as the parent
company of SoT. In or about September 2012, Renkow filed a Certificate of
Cancellation for UBS LLC with the state of Delaware. The cancellation was
granted in or about October 2012.

B. Products and Services Offered by Defendants

27. During the Relevant Period, Defendants have operated the SoT
website through which they have solicited members of the public to purchase
memberships in SoT that allow them varying degrees of access to trading strategies
and systems to be used for trading commodity futures contracts. Defendants
demonstrate how to use these trading strategies and systems through seminars,
training videos, one-on-one training sessions, and access to a “Live Trading
Room.”

28. SoT offers three levels of membership: a) a Beginner Membership for
the price of $249.99 per month; b) an Intermediate Membership for a one-time
price of $2,499.00 plus $99 per month after six months; and c) a lifetime Advanced

Membership for a one-time price of $4,999.00. The Intermediate and Advanced

levels of membership offer clients access to an increasing number of trading
strategies beyond the Beginner level.

29. Purchasers of the Beginner Membership have access to SoT’s trading
newsletter (available through a link on the SoT website), as well as a limited
number of tutorials and strategies focused on the basics of trading.

30. Purchasers of the Intermediate Membership have all of the benefits of
the Beginner Membership, as well as access to a broader array of tutorials and
strategies.

31. Purchasers of both the Intermediate and Advanced memberships have
access to a customizable automated trading system. According to its website, SoT
offers “3 different fully-automated and semi-automated trading systems for our
clients to make money on any market, any time of the day” that “[use] cutting-edge
algorithmic trading technology [...] that will allow our computer to do the trading
for us [sic].” At various times during the Relevant Period, both Intermediate and
Advanced memberships also included a Professional Trading Plan, which,
according to the “Frequently Asked Questions” section of the SoT website, is a
“personalized trade plan focusing on the best trading opportunities according to
your trading times.”

32. Purchasers of the Advanced Membership also have access to what

SoT describes as “Concierge Services.” These services include, among other

things, one-on-one training sessions and technical support, for which a client pays
an hourly fee.

33. The most highly touted benefit of Advanced Membership is access to
SoT’s “Live Trade Room.” According to the SoT website, this is “the most
important part of the Advanced Membership.” The “Live Trade Room” is a video
feed that Advanced Members can access through their computers or other
streaming devices. The SoT website describes the “Live Trade Room” as a place
where customers can follow Dufresne as he engages in “‘live trades’ called with
exact entry and exit information using [SoT’s] proprietary indicators, templates,
and strategies.”

34. During the Relevant Period, SoT has sold approximately 877
memberships and has taken in at least $2,776,994. From January through April
2016, SoT averaged nineteen (19) new clients per month and approximately
$60,000 per month in revenue from sales of memberships.

C. Defendants Solicited Clients to Purchase SoT’s Products and Services
Through False and Misleading Statements and Omissions

35. Defendants market SoT’s products and services through, among other
methods, the SoT website, seminars open to the public, marketing emails, and
various social media sites such as Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube. These
products and services are marketed to clients as tools that will enable them to make

money trading commodity futures contracts and Defendants tout the likelihood of

profits that can be gained by using them. Among the statements Defendants have

made on the SoT website, in emails to clients, and in social media are the

In a May 9, 2012 posting to the webpage www.schooloftrade-
review-diet.com, Dufresne states, “There is NOTHING more
powerful than learning by DOING with me every day, and you
will make an average of 30 ticks per day in the first 10 days
of my ‘plan’ so you will make money while you learn the
ropes” (emphasis added);

In a November 6, 2013 email to a potential client who was
skittish after a bad experience with another company, Renkow
states, “I can assure you that if your A[uto]T[rader] is set-up
correctly you should make very similar results to our posted
results. You will be fine with $7k and will make money as
planned” (emphasis added);

In a February 2014 email response to a potential client who
inquired about his ability to make back the cost of his SoT
membership through trading with Dufresne, Renkow states, “If

you trade with JJ 16 trading days per month it will take you a

(emphasis added); and

d. Ina December 21, 2014 posting to his Facebook page,
Dufresne states, “... Im (sic) talking about the simple process of
mastering a simple strategy that allows you to make $100
today, $200 tomorrow, and $400 next week... No get rich
quick... its (sic) about investing the TIME and getting PAID a

reward.” (emphasis added).

36. In the course of soliciting clients to purchase SoT’s products and
services, Defendants have made numerous false and misleading statements and
have omitted material information concerning: a) the professional experience and
trading success of Dufresne; b) the profitability and performance record of SoT’s
trading strategies and systems; and c) the actual nature of the trading activity
purporting to take place during SoT’s “Live Trade Room.”

1. Dufresne’s Experience and Success as a Trader

37. One of the major selling points employed by Defendants in marketing
SoT is the purported experience and success of Dufresne as a trader. A webpage
on SoT’s website titled “Meet the Team” lists Dufresne at the top and refers to him
as a “Professional Trader... [who] specializes in intra-day trading of crude oil,

Euro, Gold and E-Mini Russell Futures Markets along with the Major Forex

Pairs.” The SoT Blog (which is accessed from a link on the main webpage of the
SoT website) provides a link to Dufresne’s page on the LinkedIn.com website. As
late as August 2015, that page, which purports to provide a resume of Dufresne’s
professional background, stated, among other things that:
a. Dufresne “has been trading Futures and FOREX since the year
2000”;
b. “After 3 years of very successful trading, [Dufresne] opened his
first Hedge Fund in 2003”;
C. Dufresne has been a “Professional Day Trader” at Vantage
Capital Advisers LLC in Los Angeles since 2000;
d. Dufresne received an award as “Trader of the Year” in 2001;
and
e. | Dufresne was named to the “Top 30 under 30” by Professional
Trader Monthly in 2006.
38. Defendants have also touted Dufresne’s experience in solicitation
emails to prospective clients, including the following:
a. In an October 20, 2014 solicitation email, Dufresne states,
“What if you had a 14-year, professional trader helping you

every step of the way?” (emphasis added);

—_ Tt — —————— —

Case 2:16-cv-07358 Document 1 Filed 09/30/16 Page 16 of 39 Page ID #:16

 

1 b. In an October 24, 2014 solicitation email, Dufresne states,

2 “Trend-Following has been our ‘bread-and-butter’ for over 10
years” (emphasis added); and

Cc. In a May 26, 2015 solicitation email, Dufresne states, “I have

6 worked with thousands of traders in my 14-year career”
(emphasis added).

9 39. All of these statements regarding Dufresne’s background and
10 experience as a trader are false and misleading. Dufresne has not been a
, professional trader since 2000, nor has he been recognized for his trading acumen

13|| as described above. In fact, prior to 2007, not only was Dufresne not a

14 professional trader, he had no trading experience whatsoever. In September 2007,
15
16 Dufresne opened two trading accounts — one specifically for futures trading and

17|| one specifically for foreign exchange trading — in his own name with a registered

181! Futures Commission Merchant (“FCM”). In the account application documents for
19
20 each account, Dufresne was required to list his trading experience. Each

21|| application asked for the number of years’ experience he had trading stocks,

22 options, futures, and forex. Dufresne responded “none” for each category on each
23
24 application. The applications also asked for the number of trades executed in each

251| of these categories in an average month. Again, Dufresne responded “none” for
26 . as
each category on each application.

for registration as a Principal of an entity called Vantage Capital Management LLC
(“Vantage”). At the time, Vantage had a pending application with the NFA to be
registered as a CTA. In his application — which Dufresne was required to verify as
“true, complete, and accurate and... not misleading in any material respect....” —
Dufresne was required to list his employment history. For the period June 1999 to
November 2007, Dufresne listed his employment as including jobs as a
maintenance worker at a country club, a front desk operator at a fitness center, a
student worker at Arizona State University, and a loan officer, sales manager, or
owner at various mortgage companies. Dufresne’s application also stated that for
the period November 2007 to October 2008, he was unemployed. Nowhere in his
application did Dufresne state that he had been a professional day trader at Vantage
Capital Advisers LLC since 2000, or that he had been in charge of a hedge fund
since 2003. In February 2009, both Dufresne and Vantage withdrew their
applications with the NFA.

41. Dufresne’s claims to have been a professional trader and hedge fund
operator are also belied by the fact that he was incarcerated for six months in 2005.

According to the records of the Superior Court of Arizona, Maricopa County,

Case 2:16-cv-07358 Document1 Filed 09/30/16 Page 18 of 39 Page ID #:18

Dufresne was sentenced on May 12, 2005 to serve six months in the county jail

following a plea agreement to a felony charge of attempted sale of narcotics.

42. Defendants not only tout Dufresne’s experience as a trader, they also

tout his trading success, purposefully creating the impression among prospective

clients that Dufresne is able to live an extravagant lifestyle as a result of the trading

 

 

a.

success he has achieved using the strategies he is offering to clients. Among the

statements made to this effect are the following:

In a May 12, 2012 posting on the webpage www.schooloftrade-
review.com, Dufresne states, “Traders Lifestyle: we love to
trade, and we live a great lifestyle from our profits”
(emphasis added);

In a November 17, 2014 posting on his Facebook page (a link
to which is included on the SoT website), Dufresne states,
“LOL... old school traders always tell me these charts dont
(sic) work... until they see my bank account!” (emphasis
added);

In a December 9, 2014 posting on his Facebook page, Dufresne
states, “PLEASE tell me someone bought those lose [sic] on

Russell this morning! I better not be the only person cashing

d. Ina July 20, 2015 posting to his Twitter page (a link to which is

5 included on the SoT website), Dufresne states, “Thank you

6 #CrudeOil for paying my bills for me today! Love those

#Traps!” (emphasis added)

9 43. All of these statements are false and misleading. Dufresne has never
10)! been a profitable trader. Dufresne has held himself out as SoT’s Head Trader;
however, SoT has never had a trading account in its name. Between September

13|| 2007 and April 2016, UBS LLC and UBS Inc. (the parent company and successor
17! in interest parent company of SoT) opened a combined twelve (12) trading

15

Le accounts in their names. Of these twelve accounts, only four (4) appear to have

17}| had any trading activity. None of those four accounts was profitable on an

181 individual basis and the accounts incurred combined gross losses of $6,985 and
19
30 combined net losses of $9,765.14. During the same time period, Dufresne opened

214] two trading accounts in his own name and two other trading accounts in the name

221 of Lending Hands LLC (“Lending Hands”), a business of which he was indirectly
23
24 the owner. Dufresne never funded the two accounts in his own name. The two

25]! accounts in the name of Lending Hands incurred gross losses of $99,377.50 and
26 net losses of $109,258.98. Moreover, the records of the trading accounts with

which Dufresne has been associated show that, contrary to his claims on December
9, 2014, and July 20, 2015 (as cited in Paragraph 42(c) and (d) above), there were
no profitable trades and, indeed, no trades at all, on those days in any those
accounts.

2. The Profitability and Performance Record of SoT’s Trading
Strategies and Systems

44. Defendants also tout the profitability and performance of their trading
strategies and systems. For example:

a. In a January 24, 2012 solicitation email, Dufresne states, “Click

here to review the simple trading plan we used to earn 100
ticks of profit this morning!” (emphasis added);

b. Ina February 3, 2012 solicitation email, Dufresne states, “We
earned over 500 ticks per contract in January...” (emphasis
added);

c. Ina May 18, 2012 solicitation email, Dufresne states, “This
morning we finished up a record breaking week, earning over
$10,000 in profits this week alone... This is a true testament to
the effectiveness of our trading method....” (emphasis added);
and

d. Ina May 19, 2015 on-line chat with a disgruntled client who

was questioning the actual success of Dufresne’s trading,

20

 

 

 
Case 2:16-cv-07358 Documenti1 Filed 09/30/16 Page 21 of 39 Page ID #:21

1 Renkow states, “...last week we didn’t have any losing trades at
2 all for 4 of the days.”

3

, 45. At various times during the Relevant Period, Defendants directly

s || provided clients and potential clients with the performance record of SoT’s

61! automated trading systems. For example, on October 30, 2013, Renkow sent
;
3 copies to a potential client of the 2012 and 2013 performance records for SoT’s

9|| “auto-trader.” On March 18, 2014, Renkow sent another potential client a copy of

10] the performance record for SoT’s “FLEX Auto-Trader” for 2012 and 2013. At

li

1 various other times, Defendants posted the performance record of SoT’s automated

13|| trading systems on the SoT website’s “Blog,” which is accessible to the general

14 public through a link on the website’s main webpage. Those records claimed the
. following results for SoT’s Auto-Trader program:

17 a. In 2011, $169,935 in profits;

18 b. In 2012, $114,675 in profits; and

. C. In 2013, $156,150 in profits.

21 46. Defendants have stated on numerous occasions that their automated
22 trading system results were obtained in a funded trading account. On September
. 26, 2013, Defendants posted the following to the webpage www.schoolofirade-

25|| review-membership.com: “Are these strategies back-tested? Are you trading
26 . :
with real money? YES. Our automated trading systems are back-tested, forward-

least as late as June 24, 2014, the SoT website contained the following statements
in its “Frequently Asked Questions” section: “Are the Auto Trader results, Live
Results? - Yes, the auto trader results we post are indeed taken in a LIVE
environment on a LIVE account. We use the same auto trader ourselves that we
provide to our members.” (emphasis in original)

47. At various times during the Relevant Period, Defendants also posted
in the Member’s section of the SoT website, or otherwise distributed, other
performance records for SoT. Those records claimed the following results:

a. In 2011, $411,715 in profits;
b. In 2012, $433,861 in profits;
C, In 2013, $491,145 in profits;
d. In 2014, $626,864 in profits; and
e. In 2015, $716,104 in profits.

48. The profit claims made in SoT’s solicitations and in its performance
records, as set forth in Paragraphs 44, 45, and 47 above, are false and misleading.
As set forth in Paragraph 43 above, SoT has never had any trading accounts in its
name and none of the accounts in the name of either UBS LLC or UBS Inc. has

ever been profitable. Moreover, UBS LLC and UBS Inc. account records fail to

support any of the specific claims of profits cited in Paragraphs 44, 45, and 47
above.
3. Trading Activity in SoT’s “Live Trade Room”

49. Defendants operate the “Live Trade Room” to show clients how to
apply SoT’s strategies in the markets. Defendants have described the “Live Trade
Room” on the SoT website as “a web-based trading room where we watch charts,
call trades, teach our strategies, and answer questions that are typed into the chat
box.”

50. Defendants also promote the “Live Trade Room” as a place where
clients can make money by shadow-trading the trades announced in the session.
On May 9, 2012, Dufresne posted the following statement to the webpage
www.schooloftrade-review-diet.com (which, at the time, was accessible through
the SoT website): “In our trade room, I provide our members with the exact entry,
stop loss, and profit targets SPECIFICALLY so that my new traders (following the
trade plan) can shadow-trade with me during their learning process.” At least as
late as June 2014, the SoT website contained the following language with regard to
the “Live Trade Room”: “Benefit from Shadow-trading opportunities while you
learn to master your skills of professional trading. Make money the very first day

with easy-to-follow trade calls which provide EXACT information such as entry

price, stop-loss and profit-targets. You'll be amazed how quickly you will learn by
participating in our Live Trade Room with professionals.”

51. Many, if not most, sessions of the “Live Trade Room” are run by
Dufresne, although there are some sessions in which other SoT employees appear.

52. Communication between Dufresne and clients in the “Live Trade
Room” consists of: a) a chat room component, through which clients may submit
questions; b) an audio component, through which clients hear Dufresne answer
questions and announce trades; and c) a video component, through which clients
see trading charts and other visual aids.

53. Defendants purport that the activity in the “Live Trade Room” is
happening in real time. For example:

a. In a promotional video titled “Join our Trade Room,” that was
posted to SoT’s YouTube channel on July 26, 2014, Dufresne
invites viewers to join him in the “Live Trade Room,” where he
will show trading “in real time.”

b. Ina video titled “Simple Day trading strategy earns profit on
any futures market,” that was posted to the SoT YouTube
channel on May 21, 2013, Dufresne says, “I’m a teacher, but

I’m also a trader. In fact, from what I’m told I’m one of the

only people that moderates a trade room, right, trades live, and
teaches in real time.”

C. In an April 28, 2014 solicitation email, Dufresne states, “I teach
our students every morning in our Live Trade Room how to
find the best times and locations to find a price reversal and
then I call the trade in real time with exact entry and exit so
everyone can profit alongside me!” (emphasis in original)

54. Defendants also create the impression that the trading being done in
the “Live Trade Room” is being done with a real, funded account and that
Defendants are making real money as a result of the trades announced in the “Live
Trade Room.” Indeed, this is a major component of Defendants’ solicitations, both
in emails to clients and in video recaps of the “Live Trade Room” which are posted
to SoT’s YouTube Channel and are, in essence, a means of advertising
Defendants’ products and services. For example:

a. In a video titled “4 Trades for 150 ticks; We Love This Trading
Pattern,” posted on December 9, 2011, Dufresne states, “we
made 31 ticks buying fading the news, follow[ed] the plan. We
made at 9:02 here another 45 ticks, right? That’s, what, 76
ticks? So 76 ticks in the first trade, guys, that’s 760 USD

before 9:05 this morning.” (emphasis added);

Case 2:16-cv-07358 Document1 Filed 09/30/16 Page 26 of 39 Page ID #:26

In a video titled “Simple Day Trading Strategy Earns Profit on
Any Futures Market,” posted on May 21, 2013, Dufresne states,
“Just had a question come in from a guest here this afternoon
that said ‘Why we don’t trade the S&P more often?’ [...] I tell
you, I have a hard time getting to the S&P, tripping over all
these bags of cash we keep making on the Euro, the gold, the
Russell and Crude Oil.” (emphasis added);

In a January 27, 2014 solicitation email, Dufresne states,
“Monday’s trading session was FILLED with excitement, and
we made some incredible income in our Live Trade Room
alongside the members of SOT” (emphasis added);

At least as late as June 2014, SoT’s website contained the
following statement: “Follow along with professional traders as
they use Daily Price Levels and our Trading Plan to take real
trades on real trade accounts.” (emphasis added);

In an October 20, 2014 solicitation email, Dufresne states,
“Click here to watch us earn $1,950 LIVE from our Trade
Room” (emphasis in original);

In a November 16, 2014 email to a complaining client,

Dufresne states, “We earned over $500 both days you attended

our Live-Trade-Room. Our students made money with me.
...Let me be clear... I trade a live account.” (emphasis added);
and

In a video titled “WAVE Pattern Trading The E-Mini Russell
Futures; SchoolofTrade.com,” posted on April 20, 2015, a SoT
employee claims to have made 238 ticks ($1,190) in E-Mini
Russell Futures: “Let me get my stop in place here a little bit
tighter... if we get that hit. We’re looking at 238 ticks on the
trade... that’s still $1,100 on the trade... if we get them all
filled... well pause the video. We’ll come back in a little bit
and ... we held out to pull out the full move. So 238 ticks...

$1,190 dollars on the trade.” (emphasis added)

All of these statements regarding executing trades in a “real” or “live”
trading account and money made in the “Live Trade Room,” as set forth above in
Paragraphs 53 and54 above, are false and misleading. As set forth in Paragraph 43
above, SoT has never had any trading accounts in its name and none of the
accounts in the name of either UBS LLC or UBS Inc. has ever been profitable.
Moreover, UBS LLC and UBS Inc. account records fail to support any of the

specific claims of profits cited in Paragraph 54(a), (e), (f), and (g) above.

D. Defendants Failed To Prominently Display in Their Solicitation
Material Certain Required Disclosure Statements Concerning
Testimonials and Hypothetical or Simulated Trading Results and Client
Testimonials
56. The SoT website includes a webpage on which Defendants display

client testimonials.

57. As late as October 2015, the SoT webpage on which client
testimonials are displayed failed to include the language required under 17 C.F.R §
4.41(a)(3)(i)-(ii). It was not until sometime in or about 2016 that Defendants
began including the required language on the webpage. Even after it was included,
however, the language is not displayed prominently; rather, it can only be found by
scrolling all the way down to the very bottom of the webpage.

58. On their website, in their solicitation emails, and in their video recaps
of the “Live Trade Room,” Defendants have advertised performance results that
were — at best — based on hypothetical or simulated trading. While the SoT
website does include language relating to hypothetical or simulated performance,
such language can only be found by scrolling down to the very bottom of the
website’s main webpage and then clicking on a link entitled “Terms & Conditions”
that is located in the footer of the webpage. That link leads the reader to a new
webpage. The reader must then scroll about half-way down this webpage before

he finds the language relating to hypothetical or simulated performance. The

language is not displayed prominently, nor is it displayed in immediate proximity

to the performance results advertised for the automated trading program or the
other performance results. Moreover, the language displayed does not include the
following statements, which are required under 17 C.F.R. § 4.41(b): “These results
are based on simulated or hypothetical performance results that have certain
inherent limitations. Unlike the results shown in an actual performance record,
these results do not represent actual trading.”

59. None of the solicitation emails cited in Paragraph 44(a), (b), and (c)
and Paragraph 54(c) and (e) above, which touted profits earned, contained any
language relating to hypothetical or simulated performance.

60. Atleast some of the video recaps of the “Live Trade Room” posted to
SoT’s YouTube channel, failed to contain any statement relating to hypothetical or
simulated performance. Indeed, it appears that it was not until sometime in or
about late 2012, when Defendants began posting language on the webpage
containing a new video (although not in the video itself) relating to hypothetical or
simulated performance; however, this language can only be found by clicking on a
link on the webpage entitled “Show More.” It appears that it was not until in or
about April 2016, when Defendants began posting a banner with language relating
to hypothetical or simulated performance at the beginning of each new video on
SoT’s YouTube webpage. Again, however, neither the language posted on the

webpage beginning in 2012, nor the language posted at the beginning of the new

E. Dufresne and Renkow Are Control Persons of UBS LLC and UBS Ine.
61.  Atall times during the Relevant Period Dufresne and Renkow were
control persons of UBS LLC and UBS Inc. Dufresne, along with Renkow,
exercised control over the day-to-day operations of both UBS LLC and UBS Inc.,
which consisted primarily, if not solely, of the operation of SoT. Indeed, Dufresne,
at various times, has held himself out as the Owner, Founder, CEO, and Head
Trader of SoT. According to documents executed by Renkow, Dufresne was an
officer of UBS LLC and had full access to company accounts and full authority
over the operations of UBS LLC. He is a signatory and/or authorized trader on at
least some, if not all, of UBS LLC’s and UBS Inc.’s bank accounts and trading
accounts. Renkow was the sole Member of UBS LLC, and is the President, Chief
Executive Officer, Secretary, and Chief Financial Officer of UBS Inc. Along with
Dufresne, she exercised control over the day-to-day operations of UBS LLC and
UBS Inc., which consisted primarily, if not solely, of the operation of SoT. She is
a Signatory on at least some, if not all, of UBS LLC’s and UBS Inc.’s bank

accounts and trading accounts.

Inc., doing business as SoT, while acting as a CTA, by and through the actions of
its employees and agents, including but not limited to Dufresne and Renkow, by
using the mails or other means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce (1)
employed devices, schemes, or artifices to defraud clients or prospective clients,
and (ii) engaged in transactions, practices or courses of business which operated as

‘68. Because UBS LLC’s and UBS Inc.’s violations of 7 U.S.C. § 60(1), as
alleged herein, occurred in connection with statements and omissions made on the
SoT website, in solicitation emails, and on social media websites, all of which are
