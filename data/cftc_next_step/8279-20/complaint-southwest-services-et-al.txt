Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“Commission”) alleges as follows:

I. SUMMARY

1. Beginning from at least August 2016 through at least April 2018 (the “Relevant
Period”), Southwest Services, L.L.C. a/k/a South West Services, LLC (“Southwest Services’), a
Wisconsin limited liability company, offered to enter into and/or entered into agreements,
contracts, or transactions in financed retail foreign currency (“forex”) with customers located in
the United States who were not eligible contract participants (““ECPs’’) that did not result in the
delivery of forex within two (2) days of the transaction date. Southwest Services did so without
being registered with the Commission as a retail foreign exchange dealer (““RFED”), in violations
of Section 2(c)(2)(C) (ii) (aa) of the Commodity Exchange Act (“CEA”), 7 U.S.C.

§ 2(c)(2)(C) (1) (1) (aa) (2018), and Commission Regulation (“Regulation”) 5.3(a)(6)(),

17 C.F_R. § 5.3(a)(6)G) (2019).

Case 1:20-cv-01440-WCG Filed 09/15/20 Page 10f19 Document 2
2. Throughout the Relevant Period, Timothy A. Sack (“Sack’’), who organized and
operated Southwest Services as its sole managing member, associated himself with an
unregistered RFED as a partner, officer, sole managing member, or employee (or occupying a
similar status or performing similar functions), in a capacity that involved: (i) the solicitation or
acceptance of retail forex customers’ orders; or (11) the supervision of any person so engaged.
By associating himself with Southwest Services in such a capacity throughout the Relevant
Period, Sack acted as an associated person (“AP”) of an RFED without being registered with the
Commission, in violations of 7 U.S.C. § 2(c)(2)(C)(i1)(1)(aa) (2018), and Regulation 5.3(a)(6)(i1),
17 C.F.R. § 5.3(a)(6)Gi) (2019).

3. Throughout the Relevant Period, each time Southwest Services solicited an actual
or prospective customer and/or opened an account for a retail forex customer to engage in retail
forex transactions, it failed to provide each retail forex customer with a written “risk disclosure
statement,” in violations of Regulation 5.5(a)(1)@), 17 C.F.R. § 5.5(a)(1)@) (2019).

4. Throughout the Relevant Period, Southwest Services acted as an RFED and failed
to maintain records required to be kept by RFEDs, in violations of Regulation 5.13(d), 17 C.F.R.
§ 53.13(d) (2019).

5. As the sole managing member of a limited liability company, Sack controlled
Southwest Services throughout the Relevant Period and failed to act in good faith or knowingly
induced Southwest Services’ violations alleged herein. Sack is therefore liable for Southwest
Services’ violations as a controlling person pursuant to Section 13(b) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. §
13c(b) (2018).

6. At all relevant times, the acts and omissions of Sack, and any other employees

and/or agents of Southwest Services, were committed within the scope of their employment,

¢ oN “4, .
at tO Nowe peyaerat °
: p AS PPP ae Ct Pee reer as

eae? he Lea a a
agency, or office with Southwest Services; therefore, Southwest Services is liable under Section
2(a)(1)(B) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. § 2(a)(1)(B) (2018), and Regulation 1.2, 17 C.F.R. § 1.2 (2019),
as a principal for the actions and omissions of Sack, and any other employees or agents of
Southwest Services, in violations of the CEA.

7. By this conduct, and the conduct further alleged herein, Southwest Services and
Sack (collectively, “Defendants”) have engaged in acts and practices that violated certain
registration and recordkeeping provisions of the CEA and Regulations, including
7US.C. § 2(c)(2)(C) Gi) ()(aa), 17 C.F.R. § 5.3(a)(6)G), and 17 C.F.R. § 5.3(a)(6) (G1),

17 C.F.R. § 5.5, and 17 C.F.R. § 5.13(d).

8. Accordingly, pursuant to Section 6c of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1 (2018), and
7 U.S.C. § 2(c)(2)(C), the Commission brings this action to enjoin Defendants’ unlawful acts and
practices, to compel their compliance with the CEA and Regulations, and to further enjoin them
from engaging in certain commodity or forex-related activity, including soliciting or accepting
orders from non-ECP U.S. customers and offering to be the counterparty to customers’ forex
transactions without appropriate registration with the Commission, failing to keep required
records, and opening accounts without the required disclosure statements.

9. In addition, the Commission seeks civil monetary penalties and remedial ancillary
relief including, but not limited to, restitution, disgorgement, trading and registration bans,
rescission, pre- and post-judgment interest, and such other relief as the Court may deem
necessary and appropriate.

I. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

10. This Court has jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (2018)
(codifying federal question jurisdiction) and 28 U.S.C. § 1345 (2018) (providing that U.S.

district courts have original jurisdiction over civil actions commenced by the United States or by

3
Case 1:20-cv-01440-WCG Filed 09/15/20 Page 3 0f 19 Document 2
any agency expressly authorized to sue by Act of Congress). In addition, Section 6c(a) of the
CEA, 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1(a) (2018), provides that district courts have jurisdiction to hear actions
brought by the Commission for injunctive relief or to enforce compliance with the CEA
whenever it shall appear to the Commission that any person has engaged, is engaging, or is about
to engage in, an act or practice constituting a violations of any provision of the CEA or any rule,
regulation, or order thereunder.

11. Venue properly lies with this Court pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the CEA,
7US.C. § 13a-1(e) (2018), because Defendants resided and/or transacted business in the Eastern
District of Wisconsin, and certain transactions, acts, and practices alleged in this Complaint
occurred within this District.

IV. STATUTORY BACKGROUND

15. Section 2(c)(2)(C))(1) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. § 2(c)(2)(C)G)d) (2018), in relevant
part, applies to any agreement, contract, or transaction in forex that is offered to, or entered into
with, a person that is not an ECP, subject to certain exceptions not applicable herein. The
agreement, contract, or transaction in forex must be offered or entered into on a leveraged or
margined basis, or financed by the offeror, the counterparty, or a person acting in concert with
the offeror or counterparty on a similar basis. /d. Section 2(c)(2)(C)G)UI)(bb) of the CEA,

7 U.S.C. § 2(c)(2)(C)G)C)(bb) (2018), in relevant part, provides that Section 2(c)(2)(C)G)()
shall not apply to a contract of sale that results in actual delivery within two (2) days of the
transaction, or that creates an enforceable obligation to deliver between a seller and buyer that
have the ability to deliver and accept delivery, respectively, in connection with their line of
business.

16. The CEA defines an ECP, in relevant part, as an individual: (a) who has amounts
invested on a discretionary basis, the aggregate of which exceeds $10 million; or (b) $5 million if
the individual enters into the transaction “to manage the risk associated with an asset owned or
liability incurred, or reasonably likely to be owned or incurred, by the individual.” Section
§1a(18)(xi) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. § 1a(18) (xi) (2018).

17. Regulation 5.1(h)(1), 17 C.F.R. § 5.1(h)C1) (2019), in relevant part, defines an
RFED as “any person that is, or offers to be, the counterparty to a retail forex transaction,”
subject to certain exceptions not applicable here. Pursuant to Section 1a(38) of the CEA,

7 U.S.C. § 1a(38) (2018), “the term ‘person’ imports the plural or singular, and includes
individuals, associates, partnerships, corporations, and trusts.”

18. Regulation 5.1(m), 17 C.F.R. § 5.1¢m) (2019), in relevant part, defines a retail

forex transaction as any account, agreement, contract, or transaction described in 7 U.S.C.

5
Case 1:20-cv-01440-WCG Filed 09/15/20 Page 5of19 Document 2
§ 2(c)(2)(C). “A retail forex transaction does not include an account, agreement, contract, or
transaction in forex that is a contract of sale of a commodity for future delivery (or an option
thereon) that is executed, traded on or otherwise subject to the rules of a contract market
designated pursuant to Section 5(a) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. § 5(a) (2018).” Id.

19. Regulation 5.1(h)(2), 17 C.F.R. § 5.1(h)(2) (2019), in relevant part, defines an AP
of an RFED as any natural person associated with an RFED as a partner, officer, or employee (or
any natural person occupying a similar status or performing similar functions) in any capacity
that involves: (4) the solicitation or acceptance of retail forex customers’ orders; or (11) the
supervision of any person or persons so engaged.

20. Regulation 5.1(k), 17 C.F.R. § 5.1(h)(2) (2019), in relevant part, defines a “retail
forex customer’ as a person, other than an ECP as defined in 7 U.S.C. § 1a(18)(x1), acting on its
own behalf and trading in any account, agreement, contract, or transaction described in 7 U.S.C.
§ 2(c)(2)(C).

21. Pursuant to Regulation 5.3(a)(6)(), 17 C.F.R. § 5.3(a)(6)G) (2019), in connection
with retail forex transactions, all RFEDs must be registered with the Commission. Pursuant to
Regulation 5.3(a)(6)(i1), 17 C.F.R. § 5.3(a)(6)(i1) (2019), in connection with retail forex
transactions, all APs of an RFED must be registered with the Commission. The registration
requirements of Regulation 5.3(a)(6)() and (11) became effective October 18, 2010, prior to the
Relevant Period identified herein.

V. FACTS
A. Financed Retail Forex Transactions
22. During the Relevant Period, Defendants, through their website

www.currencyliquidators.com (the “website’), YouTube videos, and in-person solicitations,

6
Case 1:20-cv-01440-WCG Filed 09/15/20 Page 6 of19 Document 2
offered to enter into, and/or entered into, forex transactions in Vietnamese Dong, Iraqi Dinar, and
other foreign currencies with retail customers who were not ECPs by offering to act as the
counterparty to such transactions in Vietnamese Dong, Iraqi Dinar, and other foreign currencies.

23. As the sole managing member of Southwest Services, and the sole person
responsible for its creation and operation, Sack was responsible for the content of the website
both individually, and as the agent of Southwest Services.

24. During the Relevant Period, Southwest Services offered to act as the counterparty
to three types of forex transactions: 1) sell customers forex in cash, on a fully-paid basis; 2) buy
forex from customers for cash; and 3) sell forex via a financed retail forex transaction that
Defendants described as their “Premium + Layaway Program.” Only the financed retail forex
transactions Defendants offered through their “Premium + Layaway Program” are the subject of
the Commission’s jurisdiction.

25. Under the caption “Premium + Layaway Program ‘How it Works,’” Defendants,
through their website, offered retail customers transactions in forex utilizing a variety of
financing options, which customers could choose by selecting the “Premium + Layaway
Program” thirty (30) day or forty-five (45) day financing options displayed on the website.

26. Each of the “Premium + Layaway Program” payment plans described above were
financed by Southwest Services, acting as the counterparty, and none of the payment plans
offered to customers resulted in actual delivery of forex within two days of the transaction(s).
Instead, customers received their forex, if at all, over periods of not less than thirty (30) days,
and up to forty-five (45) days, following the date of their financed retail forex transaction. Each

of these financed retail forex transactions included a significant financing charge.

27. For example, Defendants’ “Premium + Layaway Program” thirty (30) day option,
as described on the website, directed actual and prospective customers to make a “good faith
down payment” then “[o]nce you’ ve made that down payment you’ll be deeded the full amount
of your foreign currency purchase, based on your promise to pay within the agreed 30- (sic) or
45-day term.” If customers failed to pay the balance due at the end of either the thirty (30) or
forty-five (45) day transaction, the customer’s entire initial payment was forfeited.

28. Defendants’ website offered customers a variety of options as to the amount of
the transaction in forex they may choose to enter into with Southwest Services, each of which
carried a significant financing charge included within the transaction. For example, if a customer
chose to enter into a transaction nominally involving ten million dinars in twenty-five thousand
(25,000) dinar notes, the customer would have been charged a financing charge of one hundred
twenty-nine dollars ($129.00).

29. Customers typically entered into transactions in forex with Southwest Services by
submitting an online account application through the website. Defendants’ website advised
actual and prospective customers that Southwest Services “accept[ed] a myriad of payment
options such as credit cards, debit cards, eChecks, cashiers’ checks, money orders, wire transfers,
and cash in person.”

30. The financed retail forex transactions that Defendants offered to retail customers
via the “Premium+ Layaway Program” required customers to access the website and select a
currency, denomination, amount for purchase, and the length of time to finance the retail forex
transaction, typically either thirty (30) days or forty-five (45) days.

31. Each customer then provided his or her shipping and billing addresses and

confirmed the order. The customer would immediately send a non-refundable “Premium+

Layaway Fee” to Southwest Services via money order or cashier’s check to cover the cost of
sourcing and storing the currency layaway order. The customer sent final payment within the
specified time period and once the payment cleared, the currency was mailed to the customer,
according to the website, during the Relevant Period.

32. During the Relevant Period, Southwest Services received at least $4,500,000 from
at least 1200 customers in connection with financed retail forex and cash forex transactions.

B. Failure to Keep and Maintain Required Books and Records

33. During the checkout process on the website, each customer opened an account
with Southwest Services by providing their name, billing and shipping addresses—including
city, state/province, postal code, and country—and phone number. For each of the financed
retail forex transactions Southwest Services entered into during the Relevant Period, Southwest
Services failed to keep and maintain records of each customer, the transaction entered into by
each customer, the funds paid by each customer, and the monthly and/or quarterly account
balance for each customer.

34. For each of the financed retail forex transactions Southwest Services entered into
during the Relevant Period, it failed to provide each customer with a separate written disclosure
statement required to be furnished to retail forex customers pursuant to Regulation 5.5(a)(1)Q),
17 C.F.R. § 5.5(a)(1)@) (2019).

35. For each of the financed retail forex transactions Southwest Services entered into
during the Relevant Period, it failed to keep and maintain books and records required to be kept
and maintained by an RFED pursuant to Regulation 5.13, 17 C.F.R. § 5.13 (2019), including but

not limited to: a copy of each customer’s monthly statement and transaction confirmation(s).

36. Southwest Services’ online account application did not seek any information
about prospective customers’ ability to send or receive actual delivery of forex or customers’
business need for forex. During the Relevant Period, Southwest Services failed to keep or
maintain any records containing any information about prospective customers’ ability to send or
receive actual delivery of forex or customers’ business need for forex.

37. In addition, Southwest Services’ online account application did not inquire as to
whether a prospective customer was an ECP or about a prospective customer’s savings and
investments. Southwest Services failed to keep or maintain any records containing any
information about a prospective customer’s savings and investments or whether a prospective
customer was an ECP.

38. For example, Southwest Services’ online account application did not inquire if a
prospective customer had assets in excess of $5 million, nor did it inquire if the prospective
customer was seeking to engage in forex transactions to manage the risk of an asset or liability
already owned, or about to be owned, by the prospective customer.

39, At no point in offering or entering into financed retail forex transactions during
the Relevant Period did Southwest Services solicit or obtain information concerning whether
prospective or actual customers were ECPs. Southwest Services failed to keep or maintain any
records indicating whether its customers were ECPs.

AO. Moreover, Southwest Services’ retail forex transactions neither resulted in
delivery within two days nor created an enforceable obligation to deliver between a seller and a
buyer who had the ability to deliver and accept delivery, respectively, in connection with their
lines of business. Rather, retail forex customers received their forex either 30 or 45 days

following the date of their forex transactions.
41. Southwest Services’ online account application did not seek any information
about prospective customers’ ability to send or receive actual delivery of forex or customers’
business need for forex.

42. Southwest Services’ financed forex transactions were the type of accounts,
agreements, contracts, or transactions described in Section 2(c)(2)(C) of the CEA,

7 U.S.C. § 2(c)(2)(C) (2018).

43. None of Southwest Services’ financed forex transactions was a contract of sale of
a commodity for future delivery (or an option thereon) that was executed, traded on, or otherwise
subject to the rules of a contract market designated pursuant to Section 5(a) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C.
§ 5(a) (2018).

44. Therefore, each of Southwest Services’ financed forex transactions was a retail
forex transaction.

C. Sack Was the Controlling Person of Southwest Services

45. At all times during the Relevant Period, Sack was the owner and controlling
person of Southwest Services. Sack was the sole managing member of Southwest Services, he
owned and operated Southwest Services’ website and business activities, he opened and
controlled Southwest Services’ bank accounts, and he was solely responsible for creating
Southwest Services pursuant to the laws of the State of Wisconsin. Therefore, Sack was de facto
and de jure solely in charge of the operations of Southwest Services throughout the Relevant
Period.

46. At no time during the Relevant Period were Southwest Services and Sack
registered as an RFED and an AP of an RFED, respectively, nor were they eligible for

exemptions from the requirements to register as such with the Commission.

61. During the Relevant Period, Sack acted as an officer of Southwest Services in a
