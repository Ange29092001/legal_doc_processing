ORDER

The United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (Commission) filed this
civil action against Jerry Stauffer alleging multiple violations of the Commodity Exchange Act
and its regulations. “The Commission asserted that Stauffer, who represented that he was
investing in foreign currency through currency trades (forex), defrauded his investors. At the
same time this lawsuit was filed, Stauffer was prosecuted by the Government for related
crimes. In 2016, Stauffer was convicted of both wire fraud and money laundering and 1s
currently serving a 10-year sentence followed by 3 years of supervised release.

One matter remains. “The Commission requests the Court impose a lifetime ban on
Stauffer, a permanent myunction, preventing him from trading in the markets regulated by
the Commission. (ECF No. 62.) Stauffer opposes the motion. (ECF No. 63.) Having
reviewed the motion and response, the Court agrees that an myunction is warranted, but

declines to impose a lifetime ban.
Case 1:15-cv-00201-PLM ECF No. 64 filed 03/30/18 PagelD.547 Page 2 of5

Having reviewed the record, the Court imposes a fifteen-year myunction on Stauffer
during which he may not, directly or through another person or entity, trade in the markets

regulated by the Commission.

Section 6c of the Commodity Exchanges Act, 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1, authorizes district
courts to enjoin individuals from violating the Act, or its associated rules and regulations.’
For these statutory injunctions, the Commission must establish a violation of the Act and
some reasonable likelihood of future violations. CH7C v. Hunter Wise Commodities, LLC,
749 F.3d 967, 974 (11th Cir. 2014); CFTC v. Hunt, 591 F.2d 1211, 1220 (7th Cir. 1979). A
court may infer a reasonable likelihood of future violations based on the defendant's prior
conduct. SEC v. Washington Cty. Util, Dist., 676 F.2d 218, 227 (6th Cir. 1982) ("Proof of
past violations of the securities laws serves as a basis for an inference that future violations
may occur."). In its motion, the Commission has described Stauffer's fraudulent conduct,
which occurred over approximately five years, involved more than a dozen victims and
approximately $1.8 million. Stauffer has not disputed the Commission's summary.

‘Two district courts have found that this statutory provision permits trading bans

altogether, not just injunctions against future violations of the Act. CFTC v. Arrington, 998

Many courts have granted the Commission's request for trading bans on individuals or
upheld a trading ban imposed by the Commission in an administrative proceeding. See, e.g, Ryan
v. CFTC, 145 F.3d 910 (7th Cir. 1998). In most of these cases, the individuals were brokers, floor
traders, or associated persons, all of whom must be registered under the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 12a(1).
Upon a felony conviction, registered individuals are suspended from registration and reregistration
for five years or longer, as the Commission may decide. 7 U.S.C. § 13(b). The statutory suspension
includes "using, or participating in any manner in, any market regulated by the Commission.” /d.
The explicit statutory authority to suspend registered individuals from trading does not appear to
extend to non-registered individuals.
F. Supp. 2d 847, 874 (D. Neb. 2014) ("Broader injunctions prohibiting trading activity, mn
addition to enjoming defendants from future violations, may be warranted."); CFTC v. Noble
Wealth Data Info. Servs., Inc., 90 F. Supp. 2d 676, 692 (D. Md. 2000) ("The pervasiveness
and seriousness of Baragosh's violations justify the issuance of a permanent myunction
prohibiting him from violating the Act and from engaging in any commodity-related activity,
including soliciting customers and funds.") affd in part and vacated in part CFTC v. Baragosh,
278 F.3d 319 (4th Cir. 2002). The Commission has successfully sought trading bans against
individuals in civil actions. See, eg, CHTC v. Li, No. 15 C 5839, 2016 WL 8256329, at
*10-* 11 (N.D. Ill. Dec. 9, 2016); CFTC v. Hays, No. 09-259, 2011 WL 311366, at *3 (D.
Minn. Jan. 28, 2011). And, at least one circuit court has upheld a permanent trading ban
imposed by a district court finding the ban was not an abuse of discretion. CFTC v. Wilshire
Inv. Mgmt. Corp., 531 F.3d 1339, 13846 (11th Cir. 2008) (affirming the imposition of a
permanent injunction prohibiting three defendants from engaging in any commodity-related
activity and referencing § 13a-1(b).)

Stauffer asserts two reasons not to impose a lifetime ban. First, he argues there is no
evidence that he is a threat to the markets. Second, he argues that lifetime bans are
unwarranted and generally inconsistent with precedent.

‘The Commission has demonstrated that Stauffer's conduct, fraud, poses a risk to the
market. Securities frauds undermine the public's confidence in the markets. See Dura
Pharm., Inc. v. Broudo, 544 U.S. 336, 345 (2005) (explaining that the securities statutes
maintain the public's confidence in the markets by deterring fraud); Chadbourne & Parke

LLP v. Troice, 134 8. Ct. 1058, 1074 (2014) (Kennedy, J. dissenting) (arguing against a
narrow interpretation of the Securities Ligation Uniform Standards Act because it would
inhibit the ability to "police frauds and abuses that undermine confidence in national
securities markets.").

‘Taking all of the relevant facts into account, the Court concludes that a 15-year ban
on trading in the markets regulated by the Commission 1s warranted. ‘The ban shall begin
immediately. ‘The trading ban will prevent Stauffer from trading while he is incarcerated and
while he is serving his three years of supervised release. After Stauffer's release from
incarceration and after he has served his term of supervised release, but no sooner than 10

years from the date of this Order, Stauffer may petition the Court to have the trading

restriction lifted.
Case 1:15-cv-00201-PLM ECF No. 64 filed 03/30/18 PagelD.550 Page 5of5

Accordingly, the Commission's motion for a permanent personal trading ban against
Stauffer (ECF No. 62) is GRANTED IN PART.

‘The Court imposes an iyunction, for a term of years described above, on Jerry
Stauffer which
a. Prohibits Stauffer from trading on or subject to the rules of any registered entity (as that
term is defined in Section la(40) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § La(40) (2012); and
b. Prohibits Stauffer from entering into any transactions involving "commodity interests" (as
that term is defined in Regulation 1.3yy, 17 C.F.R. § 1.3(yy) (2017) for his own personal
account or for any account in which he has a direct or indirect interest;
c. Prohibits Stauffer from having any commodity interests traded on his behalf; and
d. Confirms that this Order supplements and is in addition to the mjunctive provisions set
forth in the Consent Order entered by this Court on February 13, 2018 (ECF No. 60), and
that the Consent Order remains in full force and effect.

IT IS SO ORDERED.
