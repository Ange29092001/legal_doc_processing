A. Findings of Fact

The Parties To This Consent Order

16. Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an independent federal
regulatory agency that is charged by Congress with administering and enforcing the Act, and the
Regulations promulgated thereunder.

17. Defendant Jerry Stauffer is an individual who resided in Traverse City, Michigan.
On February 1, 2016, Stauffer was found guilty in a parallel criminal matter of wire fraud in
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1343 (2008), and money laundering in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1957
(2012). Stauffer was sentenced to one hundred and twenty (120) months in prison and is
currently serving his sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution in Oxford, Wisconsin. The
sximinal court found that Defendant’s offenses involved a violation of commodities law, and
applied a four-level enhancement to his base offense level at sentencing for that conduct.’ In
addition, based upon evidence submitted at sentencing, the criminal court found that Stauffer had
intentionally deleted files from his hard drive in violation of this Court’s SRO entered on
February 25, 2015, and applied a two-level obstruction of justice adjustment to Defendant's total
offense level for that conduct. At the time of his sentencing on June 14, 2016, Stauffer was
sixty-eight (68) years old. The criminal court also ordered that Stauffer pay restitution to the
defrauded pool participants in the amount of $845,679. Prior to his incarceration, Stauffer was
the officer, owner, principal, and sole proprietor of a boat brokerage company, Atlantic Boat
Brokers. On February 16, 2011, Stauffer filed a registration exemption with the Commission,
which was subsequently withdrawn on March 5, 2013. Stauffer has never been registered with
the Commission in any capacity.

Defendant’s Forex Trading Scheme
roraraease 1:15¢¢¥-00201-PLM ECF No. 61 filed 02/13/18 Fagelp.4se,, Fags 6 of 19 ia

im.

18. From at least June 2010 through at least the filing of the Complaint (“Relevant
Period”), Stauffer solicited prospective pool participants in person to send funds to him to trade
retail off-exchange foreign currency contracts (“forex”) in a commodity pool he operated. As
part of his solicitation, Defendant told prospective pool participants that he traded forex for a
living, was a successful trader and that he taught forex trading classes. Defendant showed at
least one pool participant past pecieeuanice charts, indicated his success at trading forex.
Stauffer told at least one pool participant that the forex trading would occur at Interactive
Brokers (“IB”), a futures coiniseaton merchant (“FCM”). In reality, Defendant’s minimal forex
trading prior to the Relevant Period was unprofitable.

19. Defendant reinforced the belief that he was highly successful at trading forex by
guaranteeing a return on prospective pool participants’ investments, Defendant had pool
participants sign a “Limited Power of Attomey with Exclusive Rights to Trade Foreign
Exchange Currencies” (“LPOA”), which promised prospective pool participants, among other
things: 1) a steady 5% monthly return on investment; or 2) the monthly retum would be rolled
over each — and pool participants would receive compound interest of 5% in their account;
or 3) a steady 10% monthly return on investment. The LPOAs were countersigned by Stauffer.

20. Defendant's representations prompted at least 14 pool participants to provide
Defendant approximately$1,883,460 for trading forex in the pool. In order to invest, pool
participants were instructed to make their checks payable to “Jerry Stauffer,” the commodity
pool operator (“CPO”). These checks were deposited into bank accounts in Stauffer’s name. In
accepting funds from pool participants, Stauffer made no distinction between the pool and Jerry
Stauffer as the CPO, accepted money in his own name and commingled participant funds with

his own funds.
Case 1:15-cv-00201-PLM ECF No. 61 filed 02/13/18 PagelD.457 Page 7 of 19
2024185937 CFTC 02:46:31 p.m. 10-31-2017 30142

21. In June 2010, Defendant opened a trading account at IB (“2010 IB trading
account”) but never deposited any pool participant funds into the account. The account
subsequently closed in September 2010.

22. Stauffer misrepresented to pool participants that the 2010 IB trading account was
funded. For instance, Stauffer gave one pool participant wire transfer documentation that
purported to show that the pool participant’s funds were deposited into Defendant’s bank
account at Citibank, N.A. (“Citibank”) in June 2010, when in fact, Defendant did not have a
bank account at that institution. Stauffer then gave the same pool participant a copy of a July
2010 trading statement of the 2010 IB trading account, reflecting a transfer of the supposed
Citibank funds (and other funds from his purported Citibank account) into the account.

, 23. — Rather than fully fund and trade the 2010 IB trading account as he told pool
participants he would, Defendant opened a forex trading account at OANDA, a Retail Foreign
Exchange Dealer (“RFED”) in February 2011, and funded it with approximately $95,000. Over _
the life of the OANDA trading account, Defendant withdrew approximately $93,000, and made
approximately $8,500 in profits from trading forex. In — 2012, Defendant opened a
trading account at FX Direct Dealer, another RFED. Stauffer similarly funded this account with
$95,000, incurred trading losses of approximately $54,000, and withdrew the remaining
approximately $41,000, In April 2012, Stauffer opened a second forex trading account at IB,
funding it with approximately $10,000; however, no trading activity occurred during the life of
this account, and Stauffer made three withdrawals totaling $9,850.

24. — In addition, Defendant sent numerous pool participants false 2010 IB trading

account statements that indicated Defendant was engaged in profitable trading at IB in the United
noraressgF5© 1:15,¢y-00201-PLM ECF No. 61 filed 02/13/18 hageld.459, Page 8 of 1,

Kingdom (“UK”), when in fact, he conducted no trading at all for the pool at IB, either in the
United States or the UK.

25: According to these fraudulent 2010 IB trading account statements, Defendant’s
alleged trading in January 2012 resulted in an account balance of approximately $683,000, and
the trading in November 2012 resulted in an account balance of approximately $799,000. Pool
participants were paid profits from the purported successful trading in the UK, when in reality,
Defendant did not have an account at IB in the UK and failed to eam any profits whatsocver in
any IB trading account. These purported profits and successful trading results prompted existing :
pool prtichienta to invest additional funds, and caused at least two pool participants to solicit
friends and family to participate in the pool.

26. In August 2013, Defendant emailed pool participants that his 2010 IB trading
account had been hacked and the account had been traded in such a manner as to incur
substantial losses. Defendant provided numerous poo! participants with an IB account statement
for July 2013, which showed a purported loss of more than $695,000. Defendant also spoke with
me or more pool participants over the telephone regarding the hacking.

27. In September 2013, Defendant notified pool participants via email that IB
informed him that someone with his personal information had contacted IB and requested access
to the account. Defendant claimed that he was suspicious that someone was attempting to steal
his identity and, therefore, decided to close his trading account. Asa silt, Defendant told pool
participants that the remaining funds would be transferred to a trading account at OANDA.

” Defendant told at least one pool participant that he planned to recoup the losses by trading at

OANDA, and that he subsequently planned to make each pool participant whole.

2024185937 CFTC 02:46:52 p.m. 10-31-2017 32 142

_ 28. Inteality, Stauffer’s trading account at IB was never hacked, nor did the account
sustain trading losses as a result thereof as was told to pool participants, because over the life of
-the account, no trading occurred. Contrary to what was told to pool participants, Defendant did
not close his IB account on his own volition. In August 2013, IB terminated its relationship with
Stauffer and closed his only funded account, which was opened in April 2012. Further,
Defendant did not transfer any funds to his existing OANDA secon in or after July 2013,

29.  Defendant’s purported forex pool was a sham, Out of the approximately
$1,883,460 received from pool participants, Defendant deposited only $200,000 in trading
accounts, withdrew approximately $144,000, and approximately $45,000 was lost trading,
Defendant retumed approximately $1,108,890 in principal to pool participants.

30. Stauffer misappropriated pool participant funds by using them for purposes other
than trading. In fact, he traded a very small amount of pool participant funds, used pool
participant funds to pay personal credit cards and expenses, transferred funds to his boat
company, Atlantic Boat Brokers, and paid pool participants purported profits (in the manner of a
Ponzi scheme) on the virtually non-existent trading.

B. Conclusions of Law
Jurisdiction and Venue

31. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 6c of the Act,
which provides that whenever it shall appear to the Commission that any person has engaged, is

32. Venue properly lies with this Court pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act, because
the Defendant resided in this jurisdiction and the acts and practices in violation of the Act
occurred within this District.

Misappropriation of Pool Participant Funds

33. By the conduct described in paragraphs 1 through 30 above, Defendant cheated and
defrauded, or attempted to cheat and defraud, and willfully deceived, or attempted to deceive, his
pool participants by, among other things, knowingly or recklessly misappropriating pool
participants’ funds, making material fraudulent statements to existing and prospective pool
participants about Defendant’s forex trading and profitability, and issuing false account
statements to pool participants in violation of Sections 4b(a)(2)(A)-(C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. §§
6b(a)(2)(A)-(C) (2012), and Regulation 5.2(b), 17 C.F.R. 5.2(b) (2014).

Fraud by A Commodity Pool Operator

34." Section 1a(11) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. §a(11) (2012) defines a “commodity pool
operator,” in relevant part, as a person

engaged in a business that is of the nature of a commodity pool,
investment trust, syndicate, or similar form of enterprise, and who, in
connection therewith, solicits, accepts, or receives from others, funds,
securities, or property, either directly or through capital contributions, the
sale of stock or other forms of securities, or otherwise, for the purpose of trading
in commodity interests, including any—

O. [forex] agreement, contract or transaction...

35. Stauffer operated as a commodity pool operator in that he engaged in a business
that is the nature of an investment trust, syndicate or similar form of enterprise, and in
connection therewith, solicited, accepted, or received funds, securities or property from others
for the purpose of trading forex.

2024185937 CFTC . 02:47:12p.m. 10-31-2017 34142

36. By the conduct described in paragraphs 1 through 30 above, Defendant, through
the use of the mails or other means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce (including
through the use of telephone calls and electronic mail with pool participants) misappropriated
pool participants’ funds, made material fraudulent statements and omissions to existing and
prospective pool participants about Defendant’s forex trading and profitability, and issued false
account statements to pool participants in violation of Sections 40(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 60(1)

“(2012).

Prohibited Activities of A Commodity Pool Operator

37. By the conduct described in paragraphs 1 through 30 above, Defendant failed to
operate the forex pool as a separate legal entity from himself, received pool participant funds in
his own name rather than in the name of the pool, and commingled pool participant funds with
his own funds, in violation of Regulation 4.20(a)-(c), 17 C.F.R. §§ 4.20(a)-(c) (2014).

order to the Clerk of Court in the criminal case for restitution. OANDA shall simultaneously
transmit copies of the cover letter and the form of payment to the Commission.
B. Civil Monetary Penalty

46. Defendant's violations of the Act and Regulations merit a civil monetary penalty.
However, this Court recognizes that in the related criminal matter: 1) the criminal court found
that Defendant’s offenses involved a violation of commodities law, and applied a four-level
enhancement to his base offense level at sentencing for that conduct; 2) the criminal court
applied a two-level obstruction of justice adjustment to Defendant's total offense level based on
Defendant’s destruction of evidence in the Commission’s case; 3) the criminal court’s order for
restitution; and 4) the Defendant’s age, financial status and length of incarceration. Therefore, a

civil monetary penalty in not ordered in this action.
