THE PARTIES AGREE AND THE COURT HEREBY FINDS:

A, Findings of Fact
1. The Parties To This Consent Order

14. Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an independent federal
regulatory agency that is charged by Congress with administering and enforcing the Act.
7 U.S.C. §§ 1-26 (2012), and the Regulations promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. §§ 1.1 — 190.10

(2017).

Case 1:17-cv-04722-LTS-DCF Document 30-1 Filed 07/27/18 Page 5 of 22

1S. Defendant Michael S. Wright is an individual whose last known address is in
Jersey City, New Jersey. Wright was the chief executive officer, founder, and chief strategist of
WTCG. Wright has never been registered with the Commission in any capacity.

2. Defendant Wright’s Solicitation Fraud, Misappropriation, and False Statements

16. From approximately 2010 through June 2017 (the “Relevant Period”), Defendant
Wright fraudulently solicited poo! participants to invest in a commodity pool for forex trading.
The fraudulent solicitations included misrepresentations that all or substantially all of pool
participants’ funds would be pooled and used to engage in forex trading. For example,
Defendant Wright told one prospective pool participant in a written solicitation that his $30,000
investment would be pooled and used for forex trading and that after 100% profit was made, the
gains thereafter would be split with the pool participant 85/15 in favor of WTCG. Such
representations were false because Defendant Wright did not use all of pool participants’ funds
to engage in forex trading and instead misappropriated pool participants’ funds for unauthorized
personal and business expenses.

17. Defendant Wright was the sole authorized signatory of WT'CG’s bank accounts.
Defendant Wright opened two individual forex trading accounts that were held in the name of
Michael Wright (the “Forex Trading Accounts”). Wright was the sole signatory of the two
trading accounts and was the only person who had authority to trade the accounts.

18. Defendant Wright transferred some but not all of the funds received from pool
participants into the Forex Trading Accounts. Between August 2010 and April 2016, Defendant
Wright deposited approximately $115,800 into the Forex Trading Accounts.

19, At all relevant times, Wright individually and on behalf of WTCG, controlled and

directed the forex trading in the Forex Trading Accounts.
 

 

Mase P1?-cv-04722-LTS-DCr Document 35 Filed o8/O2/18 Page 6 of 32
Case 1:17-cv-04722-LTS-DCF Document 30-1 Filed 07/27/18 Page 6 of 22

20. Through the Forex Trading Accounts, Defendant Wright engaged in forex
transactions on a leveraged or margined basis that did not result in actual delivery within two
days or otherwise create an enforceable obligation to deliver between a seller and buyer that have
the ability to deliver and accept delivery, respectively, in connection with their line of business.

21. As of mid-May 2016, the Forex Trading Accounts incurred, on a net basis,
realized trading losses of approximately $114,300.

22. Instead of using all or substantially all of pool participants’ funds for forex trading
as promised, Defendant Wright misappropriated the majority of pool participants’ funds for
unauthorized business and personal expenses such as food, clothing, jewelry, and entertainment.

23. During the Relevant Period, Defendant Wright made false account statements that
inflated and misrepresented the value of pool participants’ accounts and the pool’s trading
returns. Defendant Wright sent these false account statements to pool participants via email to at
least one pool participant that resided in New York County, New York.

24. The false account statements purported to reflect profitable earnings in the pool
for periods when Defendant Wright knew, or had to be aware, that there were in fact no such
profitable earnings because Defendant Wright was not engaging in forex trading at the time and
because there was an overall significant decrease in the net value of the pool due to the combined
effect of Defendant Wright’s unprofitable forex trading and misappropriation.

25. For example, shortly after the end of the second quarter of 2016, Defendant
Wright made false and misleading account statements and sent them to at least six pool
participants via email. The statements showed bar graphs that created the appearance that the
pool had consistent positive forex trading returns ranging from +1.08% a month to +18.81% a

month for each month from November 2014 through June 2016. These statements were false,

 
 

 

Case id f-cy-O04722-LTS-BCe Bocurment3s Filed og/oeie Page 7 off?
Case 1:17-cv-04722-LTS-DCF Document 30-1 Filed 07/27/18 Page 7 of 22

however, because in reality, WI1'CG did not engage in any forex trading from November 2014
through March 2015, mid-July 2015 through September 2015, or after mid-May 2016.
Moreover, the forex trading Defendants did engage in for certain periods between April 2015
and mid-May 2016 resulted in overall trading losses.

26. Although Defendant Wright did not engage in any forex trading after mid-May
2016, Defendant Wright continued to make and issue false pool participant account statements
that created the appearance of pool forex trading gains through the end of the third quarter 2016.

27, Defendant Wright did not disclose to pool participants that the pool suffered
significant trading losses or that some or all of their funds were actually misappropriated and
never used for forex trading.

28. In or around November 2016, Defendant Wright made misrepresentations via
email to at least one pool participant regarding the availability of pool funds for withdrawal,
including misrepresenting that pool funds were available for withdrawal.

29. At no time during the Relevant Period did any purported commodity pool
operated by Defendants qualify as an ECP. The purported commodity pool operated by
Defendants during the Relevant Period was a non-ECP, and was therefore subject to the
jurisdiction of the Commission, because (1) at no time during the Relevant Period did the poo!
have assets in excess of $5,000,000, (2) at no time during the Relevant Period was any purported
commodity pool formed and operated by a person subject to regulation under the Act, because
none of the Defendants were properly registered with the Commission as a Commodity Pool
Operator (“CPO”), and (3) at all times during the Relevant Period, one or more poo] participants
did not qualify as an ECP, as defined by Section la(1}8)(A)(ix) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.

§ 1a(18)(A)(ix) (2012).

3. Failure To Register with the Commission

30. During the Relevant Period, Defendant WTCG, by and through its officers,
employees or agents, used the mails, emails, wire transfers, websites, and other means or
instrumentalities of interstate commerce, to solicit pool participants and prospective pool
participants.

31. WTCG was never registered as a CPO. During the Relevant Period, WTCG acted
as a CPO by engaging in a business that is of the nature of a commodity pool and, in connection
with that business, soliciting and accepting pool funds from participants for the purpose of
trading in forex transactions described in Section 2(c)(2)(C)(i) of the Act. 7 U.S.C.

§ 2(c)(2)(C)(i) (2012), which were not transactions in foreign currency executed, traded on, or
otherwise subject to the rules of a designated contract market pursuant to Section 5(a) of the Act.

32. Defendant WTCG was not registered as a CPO while it operated and solicited
funds for a pooled investment vehicle that was not an ECP while engaged in forex transactions
described in Section 2(c)(2)(C)(i) of the Act.

33. WTCG was not exempt or excluded from registration as a CPO.

4. Commingling Pool Funds, Failure to Receive Pool Participant Funds in Pool’s Name,
and Failure To Operate Pool as a Separate Entity

34. WTCG, while acting as a CPO, failed to operate its commodity pool as a separate
legal entity, received pool funds in the name of Wright or WTCG rather than the pool, and
commingled pool funds with non-pool property by depositing pool funds into the bank accounts

of Wright or WTCG rather than a separate bank account for the pool.

B. Conclusions of Law

1. Jurisdiction and Venue
35, This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 6c of the Act,
7 U.S.C. § 13a-1 (2012), which provides that whenever it shall appear to the Commission that
any person has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a
violations of any provision of the Act or any rule, regulation, or order promulgated thereunder, the
Commission may bring an action in the proper district court of the United States against such
person to enjoin such act or practice, or to enforce compliance with the Act, or any rule,
regulation or order thereunder.
36. Venue properly lies with this Court pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
§ 13a-1(e) (2012), because the Defendant WTCG resided in this District during the relevant time,
Defendants transacted business within this District, and acts and practices in violations of the Act
occurred within this District.
2. Fraud by Misrepresentations and Omissions, False Account Statements, and

Misappropriation of Participant Funds and Fraud and Deceit by an Associated Person
ofa CPO

37, By the conduct described in paragraphs | through 29 above, Defendant Wright
cheated and defrauded, or attempted to cheat and defraud, and willfully deceived, or attempted to
deceive, WTCG pool participants by, among other things, knowingly or recklessly: making false
representations and omissions including but not limited to (1) misrepresenting to prospective
pool participants that all or substantially all of participants’ funds would be pooled and used to
engage in forex trading; (2) sending pool participants false account statements that inflated and
misrepresented the value of their accounts and the pool's trading returns; (3) misrepresenting that
pool participant funds were available for withdrawal; and (4) misappropriating pool participants’

funds for unauthorized personal or business expenses rather than engaging in retail forex trading

Case 1:17-cv-04722-LTS-DCF Document 30-1 Filed 07/27/18 Page 10 of 22

and failing to disclose that pool participants’ funds had been misappropriated, in violations of
Section 4b(2)(A)-(C) of the Act. 7 U.S.C. § 6b6(a)(2)(A)-(C) (2012), and Regulation 5.2(b)(1)-
(3), 17 C.F.R. § 5.2(6)(1)-(3) (2017).

38. By the conduct described in paragraphs | through 29 above Defendant Wright,
while acting in the capacity as an Associated Person (“AP”) of a CPO, used the mails or any
means or instrumentality of interstate commerce to employ devices, schemes, or artifices to
defraud WTCG pool participants and/or engage in transactions, practices, or courses of business
operated as a fraud or deceit upon WTCG pool participants by, among other things,

(1) misrepresenting in solicitations that all or substantially all of participants’ funds would be
pooled and used to engaged in forex trading; (2) making and sending to pool participants false
account statements that inflated and misrepresented the value of their accounts and the pool’s
trading returns; (3) misrepresenting that pool participant funds were available for withdrawal;
and (4) misappropriating pool participants’ funds for unauthorized personal or business expenses
rather than trading retail forex transactions and failing to disclose that pool participants’ funds
had been misappropriated, in violations of Section 40(1)(A)-(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 60(1 )(A)-
(B) (2012).

3. Failure to Register

39. By the conduct described in paragraphs | through 33 above, Defendant WTCG
was not registered as a CPO while it operated and solicited funds for a pooled investment vehicle
that was not an ECP while engaged in forex transactions described in Section 2(c)(2)(C)(i) of the
Act, 7 U.S.C. § 2(c)(2)(C)(i) (2012). Therefore, Defendant WTCG was in violations of Section

2(c)(2)(C) iii) (I) (cc) of the Act.

Case 1:17-cv-04722-LTS-DCF Document 30-1 Filed 07/27/18 Page 11 of 22

40. By the conduct described in paragraphs | through 33 above, Defendant WTCG
also acted as an unregistered CPO, in violations of Section 4m(1!) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 6m(1)
(2012).

4]. By the conduct described in paragraphs | through 33 above, Defendant WTCG
also acted as a CPO engaged in retail forex transactions as defined by Regulation 5.1(d)(1),

17 C.F.R. § 5.1(d)(1) (2017), and was not otherwise exempt or excluded from registration as a
CPO. Because WTCG was not registered with the Commission as a CPO and engaged in retail
forex transactions, it violated Regulation 5.3(a)(2)(i), 17 C.F.R. § 5.3(a)(2)(1) (2017).

42. Defendant Wright controlled Defendant WTCG, directly or indirectly, and did not
act in good faith or knowingly induced, directly or indirectly, WTCG’s acts in violations of the
Act and Regulations; therefore, pursuant to Section 13(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 13c(b) (2012),
Defendant Wright is liable for WTCG’s violations of Sections 2(c)(2)(C)(iii)(I)(ec) and 4m(1) of
the Act and Regulation 5.3(a)(2)(}).

4. Commingling Pool Funds, Failure to Receive Investor Funds in Pool’s Name, and
Failure to Operate Pool as a Separate Entity

43. By the conduct described in paragraphs | through 34 above, Defendant WTCG,
while acting as a CPO, violated Regulation 4.20(a)-(c), 17 C.F.R. § 4.20(a)-(c) (2017), by:
(1) failing to operate a commodity pool as a legal entity separate from Wright or WTCG,
(2) receiving pool participants’ funds in the names of Wright or WTCG rather than the
commodity pool; and (3) commingling the property of the pool with property of Defendants or
others.

44, Defendant Wright controlled Defendant WTCG, directly or indirectly, and did not

act in good faith or knowingly induced, directly or indirectly, WTCG’s acts in violations of the
 

Case bif-cv-04722-LTS-DCE Bocumertas Filed O8/O2/18 Page 12 of 22
Case 1:17-cv-04722-LTS-DCF Document 30-1 Filed 07/27/18 Page 12 of 22

Act and Regulations; therefore, pursuant to Section 13(b) of the Act, Defendant Wright is liable
for WTCG’s violations of Regulation 4.20(a)-(c).

45. Unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, there is a reasonable likelihood that
the Defendant will continue to engage in the acts and practices alleged in the Complaint and in

similar acts and practices in violations of the Act and Regulations.

IV. PERMANENT INJUNCTION

of Regulation 4.20(a)-(c), 17 C.F.R. § 4.20(a)-(c) (2017).
47. Defendant Wright is also permanently restrained, enjoined and prohibited from
directly or indirectly:
