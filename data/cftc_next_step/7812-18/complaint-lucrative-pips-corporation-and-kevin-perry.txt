Defendants.

 

 

Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“Commission”) alleges

as follows:

I. INTRODUCTION

1. From at least December 2016 to the present (the “Relevant Period’’),

Kevin Perry (“Perry”), individually and as agent and principal of Lucrative Pips

Corporation (“Lucrative Pips’’) (collectively “Defendants’’), operated a fraudulent

scheme in which they solicited and misappropriated funds for a pooled investment
vehicle in off-exchange leveraged or margined foreign currency exchange
(“forex’’) contracts.

2. Defendants knowingly made fraudulent and material misrepresentations
and omissions about their forex trading strategy and returns to persuade at least
thirty individuals (“Pool Participants”) to transfer at least $400,000 to Defendants
for the purpose of participating in a pooled forex investment vehicle.

3. To entice prospective Pool Participants, Defendants knowingly and
falsely represented that they were profitably trading forex and promised
prospective Pool Participants that their accounts would grow in value
approximately 200% to 350% in less than sixty days.

4. Further, to lure individuals to initially participate, Defendants knowingly
and falsely represented that a Pool Participant’s initial deposit with Defendants was
fully “guaranteed” against trading losses. Pool Participants were led to believe that
even if Defendants’ trading was unprofitable, upon request, the funds they initially
entrusted to Defendants to trade would be returned.

5. Despite Defendants’ claims to Pool Participants and prospective Pool
Participants that their forex trading was highly successful and that Pool
Participants could withdraw their money at the completion of trading, Defendants

did not successfully trade forex—indeed, they lost money trading forex, and
Defendants did not return Pool Participants’ money when they attempted to
withdraw funds.

6. Defendants misappropriated a portion of the funds that they solicited
from Pool Participants. As a result, Pool Participants have lost most, if not all, of
their funds due to Defendants’ fraud and misappropriation.

7. By virtue of this conduct, and the conduct as more fully set forth below,
Defendants have engaged, are engaging, and/or are about to engage in acts and
practices in violation of Sections 4b(a)(2)(A)-(C) and 40(1)(A) and (B) of the
Commodity Exchange Act (“Act”), 7 U.S.C. $§ 6b(a)(2)(A)-(C), 60(1)(A), (B)
(2012), and Commission Regulations (“Regulations’’) 4.41(a), and 5.2(b), 17
C.F.R. §§ 4.41 (a), 5.2(b) (2018).

8. In addition to the above-described fraudulent conduct, Defendant
Lucrative Pips acted at all times during the Relevant Period as a commodity pool
operator (“CPO”) by operating or soliciting funds for a pooled investment vehicle
that is not an eligible contract participant (“ECP”’) and that engages in retail forex
transactions, without being registered with the Commission as a CPO, as required
by the Act and Regulations. Specifically, Defendant Lucrative Pips’ failure to

register as a CPO violates Sections 2(c)(2)(C)@i)()(cc) and 4m(1) of the Act, 7
ULS.C. 8§ 2(c)2)(C)ai)(D(cc), 6m(1) (2012), and Regulation 5.3(a)(2)q), 17
C.F.R. § 5.3(a)(2)@) (2018).

9. Similarly, Defendant Perry solicited funds for participation in a pool
investment vehicle for the purpose of trading in off-exchange leveraged or
margined forex contracts, while associated with Defendant Lucrative Pips as an
officer, employee, or agent, without being registered with the Commission as an
associated person (“AP”’) of Lucrative Pips, as required by the Act and
Regulations. Specifically, Defendant Perry’s failure to register as an AP of a CPO
violates Sections 2(c)(2)(C)~ii)(1)(cc) and 4k(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.

§§ 2(c)(2)(C)Gu)(D(cc) and 6k(2) (2012), and Regulation 5.3(a)(2)(i), 17 C.F.R.
§ 5.3(a)(2)(i) (2018).

10. Accordingly, pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1 (2012),
the Commission seeks civil monetary penalties and remedial ancillary relief
including, but not limited to, trading and registration bans, restitution,
disgorgement, rescission, pre- and post-judgment interest, and such other relief as
the Court may deem necessary and appropriate.

11. Unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, Defendants are likely to
continue to engage in the acts and practices alleged in this Complaint and similar

acts and practices, as more fully described below.

I. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

12. Jurisdiction. This Court possesses jurisdiction over this action
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (2012) (codifying federal question jurisdiction) and
28 U.S.C. § 1345 (2012) (providing that U.S. district courts have original
jurisdiction over civil actions commenced by the United States or by any agency
expressly authorized to sue by Act of Congress). In addition, Section 6c of the
Act, 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1 (2012), provides that the Commission may bring actions for
injunctive relief or to enforce compliance with the Act in the proper district court
of the United States whenever it shall appear to the Commission that such person
has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a
violation of any provision of the Act or any rule, regulation, or order thereunder.

13. The Commission has jurisdiction over the forex solicitations and
transactions at issue in this case pursuant to Section 2(c)(2)(C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
§ 2(c)(2)(C) (2012).

14. Venue. Venue properly lies in this District pursuant to Section 6c(e)
of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1(e) (2012), because Defendants are found in, inhabit, or
transact business in this District, and because acts and practices in violation of the

Act occurred, are occurring, or are about to occur, within this District. As alleged
Case 1:18-cv-04549-CAP Document 1 Filed 09/28/18 Page 6 of 37

Northern District of Georgia, receiving at least $400,000 from those customers.

has amounts invested on a discretionary basis, the aggregate of which is in excess
of — (1) $10,000,000; or (II) $5,000,000 and who enters into the agreement,
contract, or transaction in order to manage the risk associated with an asset owned
or liability incurred, or reasonably likely to be owned or incurred, by the

a pooled investment vehicle that is not an [ECP] as defined in section 1a(18) of the
Act, and that engages in retail forex transactions[.|”

23. Section 4k of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 6k(2) (2012), and 17 C.F.R.

§ 5.3(a)(2)(i1) require any AP of a CPO, as defined in 17 C.F.R. § 5.1(d)(2), to be

operator... as a partner, officer, employee, consultant or agent . . . in any capacity
which involves: (i) The solicitation of funds, securities, or property for a
participation in a pooled investment vehicle; or (11) The supervision of any person
or persons so engaged.”

V. FACTS

A. Operation of Lucrative Pips

25. During the Relevant Period, Defendants fraudulently solicited at least
$400,000 from at least thirty Pool Participants, who were Defendant Perry’s
friends, acquaintances, and members of the public, for a pooled investment vehicle

that is not an ECP in connection with the trading of retail forex contracts.
26. On or about November 2, 2016, Defendants registered the Internet
domain name www.lucrativepips.com, which they used to host the Lucrative Pips
public website.

27. On or about December 6, 2016, Lucrative Pips was registered with the
Georgia Corporations Division. Perry is listed as chief executive officer and
registered agent for Lucrative Pips. Perry’s father is listed as Lucrative Pips’ chief
financial officer. Perry’s girlfriend is listed as Lucrative Pips’ corporate secretary.

28. Between August 2016 and January 2017, Defendants established
social media accounts for Lucrative Pips, including accounts on Instagram
(lucrative_pips), Twitter (@lucrative_pips), and Facebook (Lucrative-Pips).
Defendant Perry also used his personal Instagram account (freshkap) and Twitter
account (@freshkap), to tout the trading performance of Defendants.

29. During the Relevant Period, Defendants posted on the Lucrative Pips
social media accounts screenshots of purported profit-generating forex trades to
entice prospective Pool Participants to open accounts with Lucrative Pips. For
example on Instagram, along with the trading screenshots, Defendants posted:

a. “You want to win, you have to be on the right team! #lucrativepips

30. During the Relevant Period, from his personal Twitter account, Perry
retweeted posts from Lucrative Pips including:

a. “When one wins, we all will win! #tagafriend #lucrativepips
#takeprofits #risepiprise #forex #forexsignals;” and

b. “You can do this! #lucrativepips #trading #money #trader
#forextrader #business #pips #forextrading #wallstreet.”

31. Beginning on or about February 24, 2017, Defendants announced on
the Lucrative Pips Instagram account and Perry’s personal Instagram account that a
Lucrative Pips smartphone application (““App’”’) was available to prospective Pool
Participants at the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. The description
contained alongside the Lucrative Pips App image in Perry’s posting stated that:
“Lucrative Pips started with a single individual who earned wealth in the
foreign currency exchange market and became passionate about helping
other do the same. Continuing that journey today, we spend long hours

watching the market and testing new strategies so that we can bring the
benefits of forex to our customers.”

32. On March 2, 2017, in describing the Lucrative Pips App, the
Defendants posted on Instagram:

“The App that makes you $$$$, download now why [sic] it's free!

#lucrativepips LucrativePips.Com #takeprofits #stocks #investment #finance

#lifestyle #daytrading #forexsignals #currency #luxury #millionaire #rich

#futures.”

33. | The Lucrative Pips App is no longer available at either the Apple
App or Google Play store.

34. During the Relevant Period, Defendants opened bank accounts for
Lucrative Pips at multiple banks. By March 2018, all the Lucrative Pips banking
accounts were closed.

35. During the Relevant Period, Defendant Perry opened personal
banking accounts at multiple banks.

36. Perry deposited pool participant funds into both the Lucrative Pips
banking accounts and his personal banking accounts.

37. During the Relevant Period, Perry told Pool Participants that the
Defendants conducted their forex trading at a foreign-based trading company
(“Trading Company A’). This company has never been registered with the
Commission in any capacity.

38. At the direction of Defendants, Pool Participants entered into a

“Financial Investment Agreement” with “Lucrative Pips Corp. Foreign Currency

-ll-
Investment Trading Group.” The Financial Investment Agreement falsely stated
that Lucrative Pips shall receive and invest monies given to it by Pool Participants
and then “conduct all necessary and related financial business from trading the
investment in a Forex Trading account under Lucrative Pips.”

39. The duration of the Financial Investment Agreement was typically set
between thirty-five and fifty-five days and sometimes referred to as a “cycle.” A
pool participant’s trading cycle started after they gave their funds to Defendants.

40. At the direction of Defendants, to participate in the pool, Pool
Participants transferred funds via wire or check to bank accounts controlled by
Defendants. Defendants also accepted cash from Pool Participants at in-person
meetings. Defendants then purportedly transferred the funds to the Lucrative Pips
forex trading account.

41. Defendants told at least one pool participant that providing cash
directly to Defendants was the best way to avoid delays in the withdrawal process
caused by a Federal Reserve Bank review.

42. At least one pool participant was not an ECP as described in Part IV

above.

Case 1:18-cv-04549-CAP Document 1 Filed 09/28/18 Page 13 of 37

B. Defendants Made False and Misleading Representations and Omitted
Material Facts To Solicit Pool Participants

43. Throughout the Relevant Period, Defendants falsely and fraudulently
represented to Pool Participants that Defendants used Pool Participant funds to
profitably trade forex, and that the money deposited with Defendants was
guaranteed against trading losses.

44. Defendants failed to disclose to Pool Participants or prospective Pool
Participants that Defendants’ forex trading was generally unprofitable or that
Defendants would not return Pool Participant funds once trading was complete.

45. In personal meetings, Defendant Perry fraudulently and repeatedly
told prospective Pool Participants that the initial funds they gave to Lucrative Pips
were fully “guaranteed” against trading losses.

46. With regard to the risk involved in trading with Defendants, a version
of the Financial Investment Agreement fraudulently stated that “Forex Trading is
Risky, because of this Lucrative Pips does a 100% money back guarantee for
initial investment incase [sic] the money is lost while trading.” The agreement
further provides that if a Pool Participant’s funds are lost trading, Lucrative Pips
would contact the Pool Participant and make them aware of the situation. After
contacting the Pool Participant, Lucrative Pips would return their funds within

seven to ten days.

47. In personal meetings and in text messages, Defendant Perry
fraudulently and repeatedly told prospective Pool Participants that their accounts
would grow in value approximately 200% to 350% percent in less than sixty days.

48. As stated in the Financial Investment Agreement, Defendants’ goal
for Lucrative Pips’ forex trading was an increase on Pool Participants’ funds of up
to 350%.

49. During the relevant period, Perry falsely and fraudulently texted a
prospective Pool Participant, “$35,000-$50,000 will be earned from $20,000
investment in 2 months timeframe!”

50. Periodically during the trading cycle, Defendants sent updates to
certain Pool Participants regarding the Defendants’ trading activity. According to
these false and misleading updates, Defendants’ trading activity was
overwhelmingly profitable.

51. During the Relevant Period, Perry knowingly made the following
false and fraudulent statements via text to conceal Defendants’ fraudulent scheme

from detection:

a. “Up $47910 in the last 48 hours! Been a great week trading! Can’t
wait to show you these gains.”

b. “Your money is always growing understand that.”

c. “Gains!”

d. “Up $4763! Gains looking great.”

e. “Achieved another goal! 5 figures in profits now. Gains looking
great [a]ll trades that were placed have been profitable!”

f. “Account official[ly] doubled!”

52. Contrary to Perry’s fraudulent texts to Pool Participants that
Defendants were consistently making profitable forex trades, Defendants’ trading
was actually unprofitable.

53. For example, in August and September 2017, Perry fraudulently
misrepresented to Pool Participants that Defendants were profitably trading.
Several months later, he admitted to Commission staff that Defendants’ trading
was unprofitable. By letter dated April 20, 2018, in response to a subpoena issued
by the Commission, Perry wrote, “In August I lost over $75,000 and in September
I lost over $75,000.”

54. Pursuant to the Financial Investment Agreement and in text messages,
after a trading cycle concluded, Defendants falsely misrepresented that they would
withdraw all the profits from the forex trading account, deduct a commission for
Lucrative Pips, and return the remaining profits to the Pool Participants.

55. When Pool Participants attempted to withdraw their funds at the end
of their trading cycle, Defendants knowingly made false statements to Pool

Participants for the purpose of concealing from them that their funds had been

misappropriated or lost in trading to explain why Defendants had not returned Pool

Participants’ funds.

56.

Defendant Perry told Pool Participants that their funds were being

reviewed or held by Defendants’ bank or the Federal Reserve Bank. For example,

in text messages sent to one pool participant, (“Pool Participant A’’), between

December 7, 2017, and December 17, 2017, Perry wrote:

a.

[Pool Participant A] you can expect your money anytime, I know
I’ve said this but yes it could be another few days to next week but I
highly doubt this, bank has let me know your funding cleared the
extensive review and all we are waiting for is this to process through
and check printed.”

“Banks haven’t gotten back to me, because of the amount it’s the
reason it’s taking extra time and the fact all my investors are having
to put the funds through there [sic] name next cycles are making it be
so extensive.”

“T really apologize for this stupid delay but it’s out of my hands the
money is going through banks and must be cleared but it’s happening
as we speak just waiting for them to process your check out.”

“Banks keep taking longer across the board with all investors
withdrawing profits.”

“Funds can be put on hold from banks like this. It’s about to be over
I really assure you.”

“We are doing withdrawals of international transactions with gains
that take 15 years in months. The federal reserve can put extensive
holds.”

“T know this has taking [sic] longer than contract states but it’s out of
my control when the banks don’t clear the funds in usual times
sometime.”

“Tf we were using US brokers withdrawals would be 2-4 days no
holds ever but you only see 40% gains a year with them, we are using
international brokers, some based out of Hong Kong and Europe.
That’s when the [F]ederal [R]eserve steps in and reviews all funds
transferred and sometimes they place these hard holds.”

Perry sent a group of Pool Participants, (“Pool Participants B through

E”’) similar texts between October 2017 and December 2017 for the purpose of

concealing from them that their money had been misappropriated or lost in trading.

For example Perry wrote:

a.

58.

Participants,

“Wasn’t able to get checks, Wells Fargo let me know a extensive
review on the funds were placed. I expect all funding to clear very
soon.”

“Morning everyone the funding was placed under an extensive
review. I expected to have funding in the next 2 weeks.”

“Every time you close a business account my banker has told me they
mail you a check with the remaining balance. Problem was it’s a
international transfer with not only my funds but others.”

“All my wires get delays because of the dollar amount and where it’s
coming. The profits from this last cycle were above 6 figures which
is why this delayed happened. I assure you the funds will be in at
anytime.”

During the relevant period, Perry sent another group of Pool

(“Pool Participants F and G’’) similar texts for the purpose of

concealing from them that their money had been misappropriated or lost in trading.
For example Perry wrote:

a. “If we were using etrade or US companies this wouldn’t never
happen but it’s the fact it’s a international broker that we just have to
wait until it process out.”

b. “Contracts gets breached when federal reserve decides to hold funds.
That’s nor [sic] my control or yours it’s the governments, But trust
me you are very high on list as far as priority list, we will get it

cleared.”

c. “Markets are booming everyday hence why I believe feds are taking
Longer to clear withdrawals I believe.”

59. For the purpose of concealing from Pool Participants that their money
had been misappropriated or lost in trading, Perry also sent Pool Participants
fraudulent account withdrawal statements to purportedly prove Defendants had
sufficient funds to return money to Pool Participants.

60. Approximately November 2017, Pool Participant F contacted online
support staff at Trading Company A where Defendants purportedly had their
trading account to check the validity of Perry’s claim that Trading Company A had
transferred the funds from the Lucrative Pips trading account to a bank account
controlled by Defendants. Pool Participant F and Trading Company A online
support staff conducted their communications via an online chat room available on

Trading Company A’s website.

61. Pool Participant F provided Trading Company A online support staff a
communication Perry had provided her which Perry claimed was a confirmation
from Trading Company A documenting his withdrawal request and verifying that
Defendants’ funds were in the process of being wired to a bank account controlled
by Perry.

62. In response to this “confirmation,” Trading Company A online
support staff responded, “We have no pending withdraw [sic] funds with this
account.”

63. Ina separate conversation with Trading Company A online support
staff, after providing a screenshot of Perry’s withdrawal request and additional
account information, the online support staff told Pool Participant F that “This
Account have no Money[.| Client is already lose all funds in trading[.]”

64. Regarding the purported withdrawal request that Perry had provided
Pool Participant F, Trading Company A online support staff stated, “This Receipt
is fake.”

65. As late as April 2018, Defendants continued to solicit Pool
Participants for additional funds, claiming that if the Defendants are able to raise a
sufficient amount of money to open a new account at a different broker, all the

money to which Pool Participants are entitled would be released.

-19-
Case 1:18-cv-04549-CAP Document 1 Filed 09/28/18 Page 20 of 37

66. Specifically, Perry texted Pool Participant F and explained that
Defendants had transferred $475,000 from the Trading Company A to an
intermediary broker because that broker could then transfer the $475,000 to a
regulated broker. Perry further explained that once Defendants transferred the
money to a regulated broker, Defendants could withdraw the money in one to five
business days and pay all the Pool Participants.

67. According to Perry, however, to transfer that much money to the
regulated broker required a “VIP account” with an initial deposit of $100,000. In a
text message to Pool Participant F, Perry claimed to already have $73,000, but
needed an additional $27,000 to open a VIP account. Perry asked Pool Participant
F to give him $27,000 so he could open a VIP account and pay all the Pool
Participants in less than two weeks. Pool Participant F did not give Perry any
additional funds.

C. Defendants Misappropriated Pool Participants’ Funds

68. During the Relevant Period, Defendants received at least $400,000
from at least thirty Pool Participants.

69. During the Relevant Period, Perry misappropriated Pool Participant
funds by depositing these funds into his personal banking account that was used to

pay personal expenses.

20 -
Case 1:18-cv-04549-CAP Document 1 Filed 09/28/18 Page 21 of 37

70. Starting in at least September 2017, Defendants misappropriated Pool
Participant funds by failing to return funds to Pool Participants upon their request
pursuant to the terms of their Financial Investment Agreement with Lucrative Pips.

71. For example, during the Relevant Period different Pool Participants
texted Perry the following:

a. “Kevin, I need my check. You have had more than enough time to get
past any issues you’ ve continued to come up with as to why you do
not have my money. You have broken the terms written in the
contract numerous times. You don’t play games with other peoples’
money man. What you’re doing is extremely illegal.”

b. “Today is the 15" business day after the cycle ended. On the contract
it says 7-10 business days after the money is transfer [sic] out of the
account we will receive a check. Maybe I just didn’t check the mail
today, but I haven’t received a check nor had anybody else.”

72. To the extent Pool Participants received any funds, those funds were
misappropriated by Defendants from other Pool Participants, in the nature of a
Ponzi scheme, or came from Defendants’ personal assets in order to entice Pool
Participants to give Defendants additional funds.

73. To date, despite repeated requests, most Pool Participants have not

received any of their funds back from Defendants.
