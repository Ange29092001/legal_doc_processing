JIONGSHENG ZHAO,
DEFENDANT.

 

COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,
CIVIL MONETARY PENALTIES, AND OTHER RELIEF

Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) alleges as follows:

I. SUMMARY

1. From at least July 2012 through at least March 2017 (the “Relevant Period”),
Defendant Jiongsheng Zhao (“Zhao”) engaged in a manipulative and deceptive scheme while
placing orders for and trading futures contracts on a registered entity. In furtherance of this
scheme, Zhao repeatedly engaged in manipulative or deceptive acts and practices by “spoofing”
(bidding or offering with the intent to cancel the bid or offer before execution). On thousands of
occasions, Zhao placed an order that he wanted to execute and thereafter entered a larger order
on the opposite side of the market that he intended to cancel before execution. In placing these
larger spoof orders, Zhao intentionally or recklessly sent false signals of increased supply or

demand designed to trick market participants into executing against the orders he wanted filled.

2. By virtue of this conduct, as further described herein, Zhao has engaged in acts and
practices that violate Sections 4c(a)(5)(C) and 6(c)(1) of the Commodity Exchange Act (“Act”),
7 U.S.C. §§ 6c(a)(5)(C), 9(1) (2012), and Commission Regulation (“Regulation”) 180.1(a)(1)
and (3), 17 C.F.R. § 180.1(a)(1), (3) (2017).

3. The CFTC brings this action pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1
(2012), to enjoin Zhao’s violative acts and practices and to compel Zhao’s compliance with the
Act and Regulation. In addition, the CFTC seeks civil monetary penalties and such other relief,
including but not limited to disgorgement and trading and registration prohibitions, as the Court
deems necessary and appropriate.

Hf. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (2012) (federal
question jurisdiction) and 28 U.S.C. § 1345 (2012), which provides that district courts have
original jurisdiction over civil actions commenced by the United States or by any agency
expressly authorized to sue by Act of Congress. Section 6c(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1(a)
(2012), authorizes the Commission to seek injunctive relief in any proper district court of the
United States against any person whenever it shall appear to the Commission that such person
has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a violation of
any provision of the Act or any rule, regulation or order thereunder.

5. Venue properly lies with this Court pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act, because
Zhao transacts business in the Northern District of Illinois, and the acts and practices in violation
of the Act and Regulation have occurred within this District.

Hil. THE PARTIES

6. Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading Commission is the independent federal

regulatory agency charged by Congress with the administration and enforcement of the Act and
Case: 1:18-cv-00620 Document #: 1 Filed: 01/28/18 Page 3 of 17 PagelD #:3

rules, regulations, and orders thereunder. The CFTC is headquartered at 1155 21st Street, NW,
Washington, DC 20581.

7. Defendant Jiongsheng Zhao is a resident of New South Wales, Australia. Zhao has
been employed by a proprietary trading firm (the “Trading Firm”) as a trader for nearly nine
years. Zhao has never been registered with the CFTC.

IV. OTHER RELEVANT ENTITIES

8. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (“CME”) is a commodity exchange located at
20 S. Wacker Street, Chicago, Illinois 60606. It is registered with the CFTC as a designated
contract market and a swap execution facility.
9. CME Group Inc. (“CME Group”) is a Delaware corporation with its principal place
of business in Chicago, Illinois. CME Group is the holding company that owns CME.
Vv. FACTS

A. Futures Trading Background

10. A futures contract is an agreement to purchase or sell a commodity for delivery or
cash settlement in the future at a specified price. A futures contract traded on an exchange has
standard, non-negotiable contract specifications.

11. The E-mini S&P 500 Index futures contract (the “ES contract”) is traded on CME, a
registered entity. There are four ES contract delivery months: March, June, September, and
December. The ES contract is cash settled so no delivery of the stocks that make up the
underlying index takes place.

12. The ES contract trades 24 hours per day from 5:00 PM Central Time on Sunday
night to 4:00 PM Central Time on Friday afternoon, except for a 15-minute window each day
when trading halts. The trading day for the ES contract is commonly regarded as consisting of

two trading sessions: the daytime session and the overnight session. The daytime session

corresponds with open-outcry trading at the CME and runs from 8:30 AM to 3:15 PM Central
Time. The overnight session begins after the 15-minute trading halt and runs from 3:30 PM to
8:29:59 AM Central Time the next day. The daytime session corresponds with, but does not
perfectly overlap, the trading day for the stocks that make up the underlying index, which runs
from 8:30 AM to 3:00 PM Central Time on the NYSE and NASDAQ exchanges.

13. The value of the ES contract is the S&P 500 stock index multiplied by fifty dollars.
The price of the ES contract is quoted in index points, and the minimum price change allowed
during a trading session is one-quarter of an index point (0.25); thus, if a trader wished to place
an order above the last traded ES contract price of 2648.25 points, that trader would have to
place the order at 2648.50 points or higher. This minimum price change is commonly called a
“tick.”

14. An “order,” in the context of electronic exchange trading, is a request submitted to
an exchange to buy (that is, “bid”) or sell (that is, “offer” or “ask’”’) a certain number of a
specified futures contract. An order is for one or more contracts. Contracts may also be called
“lots,” among other things. Orders are entered into the exchange’s order book. When there
exists both a willing buyer and seller for a contract at a given price, a transaction occurs and is
referred to as a “fill” (or a “trade” or “execution”). At any time before the order is fully filled,
the trader can “cancel” the order. When an order is canceled, the contracts that have not yet been
bought or sold are pulled from the order book.

15. Each trader can view the aggregate number of contracts and orders that all traders are
actively bidding or offering at a given price level. Only the total numbers of orders and contracts
at various price levels are visible, not the identities of the traders who placed the orders. The

best-bid level, or first-bid level, is the highest price at which someone is willing to buy. The

pales

best-ask level, or first-ask level, 1s the lowest price at which someone is willing to sell. The bid-
ask spread is the difference between those two prices.

16. Traders can view the aggregate resting contracts and orders up to the tenth-bid and
tenth-ask levels. This combined bid and ask information is often referred to as the visible order
book and represents the visible market depth. Traders often consider information in the order
book when making trading decisions.

17. An “aggressive” order is an order that crosses the bid-ask spread. On the buy side of
the market, an aggressive buy order is placed at the best-ask price or higher so, put simply, it is
an offer to buy at a price that another trader is currently willing to sell. On the sell side of the
market, an aggressive sell order is placed at the best-bid price or lower so, put simply, it 1s an
offer to sell at a price that another trader is currently willing to buy. Accordingly, aggressive
orders are guaranteed to execute, at least partially, immediately after being placed.

18. A “passive” order, on the other hand, does not give up the spread in price. On the
buy side of the market, a passive buy order is placed at the best-bid price or lower so, put simply,
it is an offer to buy at a price that is lower than the price that other traders are currently willing to
sell. On the sell side of the market, a passive sell order is placed at the best-ask price or higher,
so, put simply, it is an offer to sell at a price that is higher than the price that other traders are
currently willing to buy. Passive orders rest for at least some amount of time after being placed
and are not guaranteed to execute.

19. The ES contract is traded electronically on the CME Globex trading system
(“Globex’”’). Globex employs a matching algorithm to match bids and offers for execution. The
matching algorithm for the ES market is known as “FIFO,” which denotes first-in, first-out.

Under the FIFO method, orders on the same side of the market (i.e., the buy side or sell side) and
Case: 1:18-cv-00620 Document #: 1 Filed: 01/28/18 Page 6 of 17 PagelD #:6

at the same price are filled based on time priority; thus, with a few exceptions not pertinent here,
the order that was placed first trades first, irrespective of the order’s size.

B. Zhao’s Manipulative and Deceptive Scheme

20. Zhao has worked as a trader at the Trading Firm for nearly nine years. In this role,
he trades futures contracts on U.S. and international exchanges. Zhao does not trade on behalf of
any party other than the Trading Firm. He shares any profits generated from his trading with the
Trading Firm. Zhao’s direct supervisor is the Trading Firm’s CEO.

21. During the Relevant Period, Zhao engaged in a manipulative and deceptive scheme
(the “Scheme”’) that consisted of the following general pattern: (1) placing one or more passive
small orders (that is, fewer than fifty contracts) on one side of the market, which he intended to
execute (“Genuine Orders”); (2) placing one or more passive large orders (that is, fifty contracts
or more) on the opposite side of the market, within two minutes of placing the Genuine Order
and while the Genuine Order is still pending, which he intended to cancel (“Spoof Orders”);

(3) reaching at least a five-to-one total contract size imbalance between his Spoof Orders and
Genuine Orders, respectively; and (4) canceling the Spoof Orders within two seconds after they
were placed. Each instance of this pattern comprises a single “Event.” Collectively, “Genuine
Orders” and “Spoof Orders” are referred to as “Event Orders.”

22. Zhao’s Scheme was designed to benefit financially from market participants’
reactions to his Spoof Orders. The following is a simplified explanation of how his Scheme was
intended to work, using a hypothetical example of a Spoof Order on the buy side. A large Spoof
Order to buy would result in an increase in demand in the order book (1.e., create or add to an
order book imbalance in which orders to buy outweigh orders to sell). This increase would be
visible to other market participants and may lead them to conclude that the price is likely to rise.

This conclusion, in turn, would impact market participants’ decisions, including prompting some

to attempt to purchase contracts before the predicted rise in price happens. In such a case, these
participants would place aggressive orders to buy (1.e., at a higher price than the currently resting
bids in the market), making execution of orders resting on the opposite side of the Spoof Order
more likely. Finally, these bids would enable orders on the opposite side of the Spoof Order—
including Zhao’s Genuine Orders—to sell sooner, at a better price, or in larger quantities than
they otherwise would.

23. Zhao carried out his Scheme on the ES contract market traded on CME. For some or
all of the Relevant Period, Zhao traded manually, by submitting orders, cancelations, and
modifications using a computer mouse or keyboard.

24. During the Relevant Period, as part of the ongoing Scheme, Zhao engaged in
approximately 2,300 Events. As part of those Events, Zhao entered about 2,300 Genuine Orders
and 3,100 Spoof Orders, with all of the Spoof Orders, according to the pattern described herein,
quickly being canceled.

25. Zhao intended to cancel the Spoof Orders before execution, and often did so after his
Genuine Orders were filled. The predictable sequence inherent in Zhao’s spoofing pattern,
which he engaged in thousands of times, demonstrates that Zhao was not reacting to market
changes when he canceled the Spoof Orders; rather, he was carrying out a predetermined
strategy that was not dependent on market conditions.

26. By engaging in the Scheme as described herein, Zhao entered Spoof Orders either to
intentionally send a false signal to the market that he actually wanted to buy or sell the number of
contracts specified in the Spoof Orders, or while recklessly disregarding the fact that entering his
spoof orders would send such a false signal—a signal that injected false information about

supply and demand into the market that could affect market activity. Zhao engaged in this

Scheme to trick other market participants into executing against his Genuine Orders on the
opposite side of the market—allowing them to fill sooner, at a better price, or in larger quantities
than they otherwise would. Zhao knew or recklessly disregarded that the Spoof Orders would
create the false appearance of market depth and result in misinformation, thereby luring market
participants to trade based on Zhao’s spoofing. The risk that the Spoof Orders could mislead
other market participants into believing there was genuine interest in purchasing or selling the
specified number of contracts represented by Zhao’s Spoof Orders was so obvious that Zhao
must have been aware of it. He knew that his Spoof Orders would appear in the order book and
that traders often consider order-book information in making trading decisions; thus, Zhao was,
at least, reckless with respect to the danger that his Spoof Orders would mislead other market
participants.

27. Although Zhao’s Spoof Orders were visible to the rest of the market, his identity as
the originator of those orders was not. Only the total numbers of orders and contracts at various
price levels are visible, not the number of traders or identities of the traders who placed the
orders. Accordingly, Zhao knew that other market participants could not see that the same trader
had placed both the Spoof Orders and the Genuine Orders, which might have tipped off market
participants that his Spoof Orders were not bona fide.

28. Trading overnight was a key component of Zhao’s Scheme and indicative of his
wrongful intent. Zhao carried out his Scheme more than 99% of the time during overnight
sessions, when trading volume and volatility were substantially decreased. As a result of the
reduced volume and volatility depth during overnight sessions, Zhao was able to use smaller

Spoof Orders (with concomitant lower financial risk) to provoke the market reactions he desired.

29. The near-perfect correlation between Zhao’s Scheme and his use of overnight
sessions cannot be explained by his residing in Australia, where the overnight session largely
occurs during daylight hours. Setting the Scheme aside, Zhao often traded during daytime
sessions, which overlaps with nighttime in Australia. Indeed, nearly one-third of Zhao’s non-
Event orders (1.e., orders that were not part of the Scheme) were placed during daytime sessions;
thus, Zhao’s focus on carrying out his Scheme almost exclusively during overnight sessions 1s
indicative of his wrongful intent.

30. Further, Zhao’s trading pattern shows he avoided placing large Spoof Orders when
they were more likely to execute. Had Zhao actually wanted to trade the quantities in his Spoof
Orders, he would have placed similar-size orders during daytime sessions, when trading volume
was higher and the larger quantities were more likely to execute; however, he did not. As
reflected in the table below, during the Relevant Period, Zhao placed only about 2% of his large
orders (both Spoof and non-Spoof) during daytime sessions. By contrast, Zhao placed about
29% of his small orders during daytime sessions; thus, Zhao avoided placing large orders when
they had better chances of executing, but he did not similarly curtail his small orders. This
further indicates that large order sizes were not an aspect of Zhao’s legitimate trading. Rather,
they were part of a scheme to mislead market participants by falsely signaling increased supply

or demand for the purpose of luring market participants to trade based on his spoofing.

31. Zhao’s Scheme frequently worked as planned; that is, his Spoof Orders tricked other
market participants into executing against his Genuine Orders. However, there were times that
Zhao’s Genuine Orders continued to sit, unfilled, even after he placed and canceled his Spoof
Orders; thus, not all of the Events resulted in executions of Zhao’s Genuine Orders. Still, Zhao’s
Genuine Orders seldom terminated in cancelations, again demonstrating the differing intent
behind his Spoof and Genuine Orders. Even though, by definition, 100% of Spoof Orders
terminated with at least a partial cancelation, the same was true for only about 22% of the
Genuine Orders. The difference is that Zhao wanted his Genuine Orders to execute.

32. Zhao also took steps to protect his Spoof Orders from execution. For example, he
canceled the Spoof Orders almost immediately after placing them; their median cancelation time
was 737 milliseconds, as illustrated in the table below. By contrast, on those rarer occasions
when Zhao canceled his Genuine Orders, the median cancelation time was 106 seconds. This
means that Zhao allowed his Genuine Orders to rest prior to cancelation for a much longer period
than his Spoof Orders. The consistently fast cancelation times for Zhao’s Spoof Orders reflect

his intent to cancel them from the outset.

33. Zhao’s efforts to avoid execution of his Spoof Order were successful. This is
reflected in vastly diverging rates in which Zhao’s Genuine and Spoof Orders were partially or
fully filled (the “hit rate’). As reflected in the table below, Zhao placed approximately 2,300
Genuine Orders during the Relevant Period. Of these, about 79% were hit. By contrast, less
than 1% of the approximately 3,100 Spoof Orders were hit. Thus, Zhao’s Genuine Orders were
about 180 times more likely to be hit. As a general matter, whether an order is hit is not
dependent on its size; rather, orders at the same price level execute according to time priority
under the FIFO matching algorithm. Here, the stark contrast in hit rates results from differences
in the orders’ relative competitiveness, over which Zhao had control, and illustrates his success

in avoiding execution of his Spoof Orders.

Case: 1:18-cv-00620 Document #: 1 Filed: 01/28/18 Page 12 of 17 PagelD #:12

34. The use of large orders was a hallmark of Zhao’s Scheme; he rarely placed large
orders otherwise. He placed about 3,800 large orders during the Relevant Period; 82% of those
were placed pursuant to the Scheme as Spoof Orders. By contrast, Zhao placed about 62,700
small orders during the Relevant Period. Only about 4% of these orders fell within the Scheme
as Genuine Orders. Zhao’s limited use of large order sizes, nearly always as part of the Scheme
and not as part of a legitimate trading strategy, is indicative of his illegal conduct. He primarily
used large orders to send false signals of increased supply or demand to market participants.

C. Examples of Zhao’s Scheme

35. Zhao’s Scheme 1s illustrated in the three Events set forth below. Detailed trade data
associated with these Events is provided in Exhibit A to this Complaint.

I. Event Example 1: April 15, 2013

36. Zhao’s trading in the early morning of April 15, 2013 constitutes an Event pursuant
to his Scheme. See Ex. A at 1—8 (displaying detailed trade data). At 1:11:16.287 AM Central
Time (denoted in hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds), Zhao placed an order to sell one
contract (the Genuine Order) at the best-ask level. See id. at 1, row 2. About ten seconds later,
at 1:11:25.537 AM, Zhao placed an order to buy 151 contracts at the best-bid level (the first
Spoof Order). See id. at 2, row 33. The first Spoof Order doubled the number of contracts then
resting at that level of the order book, but the order was not at risk of executing until the 151
contracts resting ahead of it executed or were withdrawn. Zhao’s first Spoof Order did not
immediately induce execution of his Genuine Order, and he canceled it at 1:11:26.240 AM (only
703 milliseconds after placing it). See id. at 2, row 47. A short time later, Zhao tried again. At
1:11:33.363 AM, he placed an order to buy 171 contracts at the best-bid level (the second Spoof
Order), more than doubling the number of contracts resting at that level of the order book. See

id. at 3, row 89. This time, Zhao’s Genuine Order executed at 1:11:33.366 AM, immediately

after the second Spoof Order was placed. See id. at 4, row 103. He then canceled his second
Spoof Order at 1:11:34.161 AM, within 798 milliseconds of placing it. See id. at 8, row 252.

2. Event Example 2: March 5, 2014

37. Zhao’s trading in the final hours of March 5, 2014 shows an Event that did not result
in execution of the Genuine Order, contrary to Zhao’s plan. See Ex. A at 9-12. At 22:44:12.924
PM Central Time, Zhao placed an order to buy one contract (the Genuine Order) at the best-bid
level. See id. at 9, row 2. Three seconds later, at 22:44:15.720 PM, Zhao placed an order to sell
201 contracts (the Spoof Order) at the best-ask level. See id. at 9, row 15. Zhao’s Spoof Order
was nearly 2.5 times the size of the combined orders then resting at that price level of the order
book, but it was not at risk of executing until the 82 contracts resting ahead of it executed or
were withdrawn. Zhao’s Genuine Order did not immediately execute. Zhao canceled his Spoof
Order at 22:44:16.394 PM, only 674 milliseconds after placing it. See id. at 10, row 40. He let
his Genuine Order rest longer, but canceled it as well at 22:44:40.533 PM, about half a minute
after placing it. See id. at 12, row 97.

3. Event Example 3: March 21, 2016

38. A third example occurred on March 21, 2016. See Ex. A at 13-18. At 7:31:28.726
AM Central Time, Zhao placed an order to sell 11 contracts (the Genuine Order) at the best-ask
level. See id. at 13, row 2. About five seconds later, at 7:31:33.645 AM, Zhao placed an order
to buy 82 contracts (the Spoof Order) at the best-bid level. See id. at 13, row 441. The Spoof
Order was over half the size of the combined orders then resting at that price level, but 1t was not
at risk of executing until the 153 contracts resting ahead of it executed or were withdrawn.
Almost immediately, at 7:31:33.980 AM and 7:31:33.981 AM, Zhao’s Genuine Order executed

through one trade of one and one trade of ten contracts. See id. at 13, rows 456 & 458. Zhao

then canceled his Spoof Order at 7:31:34.389 AM, just 744 milliseconds after placing it. See id.
