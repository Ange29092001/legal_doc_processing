(“Commission”) filed a Complaint [D.E. #1] against Defendants Forex Monthly Income Fund,

4
Case Odd-cov-62240.VPQ Document @O Entered on FLSD Docket OL/2o/2016 Page 5 of 22

Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, permanent injunction and equitable relief pursuant to 7
U.S.C. § 13a-1, as set forth herein. The findings and conclusions in this Consent Order are not
binding on any other party to this action.

THE PARTIES AGREE AND THE COURT HEREBY FINDS:

A. Findings of Fact
1. The Parties To This Consent Order

14. Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an independent federal
regulatory agency that is charged by Congress with administering and enforcing the CEA,
7 U.S.C. §§ 1 et seg., and the Regulations promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. §§ 1.1 ef seq..
15. Defendant Robert Tripode is an individual residing in Boynton Beach, Florida.
Tripode was at all material times hereto an agent of FMIF. Tripode has never been registered
with the Commission in any capacity.

2. The Foreign Currency (“Forex”) Trading Scheme

16. From January 2011 through at least June 2013 (“Relevant Period’), FMIF, by and
through its principals, Chauvel and Pierre-Charles, and its agent, Tripode, solicited members of
the public (hereinafter, “pool participants”), by use of the mails and/or other means or
instrumentalities of interstate commerce, to send money to FMIF to trade forex in a commodity
pool operated by FMIF. Some of the pool participants solicited were unsophisticated investors,
including senior citizens, who sought higher monthly income on their retirement savings.

17. As part of their solicitation, Defendants represented to prospective pool
participants that FMIF offered a safe investment with steady, guaranteed returns. Defendants
reinforced this belief by providing pool participants a “Schedule of Monthly Returns” stating the
exact amount of each monthly payment the pool participants were to receive based on the size of

their investments.
Case Odd-cov-62240.VPQ Document @O Entered on FLSD Docket OL/29/2016 Page 6 of 22

18. Tripode communicated with existing poo! participants and directed at least some
pool participants to sign a “Foreign Currency Fund Membership Agreement” (hereinafter,
“Agreement’). The Agreement reiterated the guaranteed monthly returns and also provided that
either party could terminate the Agreement and that funds would be refunded upon 60 days
written notice.

19. FMIF also solicited pool participants through a website,
www.forexmonthlyincomefund.com, in which FMIF was described as the “world’s leading and
most trusted online investment opportunity” and “an international investment company which
has been efficiently operating in the Forex market since 2010.” The website also repeated the
guarantees: “FMIF provides its clients with a fixed monthly income at a predetermined rate,
with return of your initial deposit with a [sic] 60 days written notice.”

20. | FMIF’s website offered pool participants four separate “plans” under which they
could participate in the FMIF pool. These plans touted monthly returns on investment from two
to three percent and annual returns from 30 to 50 percent.

21. FMIF’s website also offered an “Affiliate/Referral Program” under which pool
participants and non-participants alike could receive guaranteed payments for referring new pool
participants to the FMIF pool.

22. Defendants’ representations, as described above, prompted more than 100 pool
participants to provide FMIF approximately $1.429 million for trading forex in the purported
FMIF pool. In his role as an agent of FMIF, Tripode personally solicited at least 24 of these pool
participants. As part of his solicitations, Tripode repeated the guaranteed monthly returns

promised to pool participants and, in fact, countersigned as “Authorized Agent” the participant
Case Odd-cov-62240.VPQ Document @O Entered on FLSD Docket OL/2o/2016 Page ? of 22

Agreements that contained the guarantees. As a result of Tripode’s solicitations, these 24 pool
participants provided $584,632.07 to FMIF for trading in the FMIF pool.

23. In order to invest, pool participants were instructed to make their checks payable
to FMIF that were deposited into two bank accounts. Pierre-Charles and Chauvel had sole
signatory authority over these bank accounts.

24. FMIF did not open any domestic forex trading accounts or any foreign forex
trading accounts.

25. As early as summer 2012, FMIF was losing its ability to keep up with the
promised monthly payments to pool participants. In a July 2012 letter sent to FMIF pool
participants, Chauvel and Pierre-Charles, identified as the CFO and CEO of FMIF, respectively,

2 66

wrote that the pool participants’ “percentages [i.e., the promised returns on investment] are
temporarily adjusted down due to market conditions...but we expect the situation to back [sic] to
normal within the next 60-90 days.”

26. By early 2013, new deposits from pool participants ceased flowing into FMIF.
Within weeks of receiving the last deposit, FMIF ceased making regular monthly payments to
pool participants. At least as early as fall 2013, some pool participants demanded that FMIF
return their principal payments. Some or all of these demands were not honored by FMIF,
despite the guarantee of withdrawal upon 60 days written notice.

27. Inreality, FMIF’s purported forex pool was a sham. Defendants knowingly,
willfully, or recklessly made, or caused others to make, multiple material misrepresentations and
omissions in their solicitation of existing and prospective pool participants, including as

described above. In making their investment decisions, existing and prospective pool

participants in the FMIF pool relied on Defendants’ material misrepresentations and omissions,
Case Odd-cov-62240.VPQ Document @O Entered on FLSD Docket OL/2o/2016 Page 8 of 22

including statements regarding FMIF’s trading activity, purported profits earned from that
trading, and the manner in which pool participants’ funds would be used.

28. Instead of trading forex and paying the promised returns, FMIF, Chauvel, and
Pierre-Charles misappropriated the vast majority of pool participants’ funds. Of the $1.429
million received from pool participants, FMIF, Chauvel, and Pierre-Charles collectively returned
only approximately $356,000 in the form of purported monthly profits from forex trading and
withdrawals of principal. Tripode personally returned approximately $32,000 to pool
participants. The remaining approximately $1,041,000 was misappropriated by FMIF, Chauvel,
and Pierre-Charles.

29. In order to conceal and perpetuate their fraud, Defendants distributed false
statements to existing and prospective pool participants through the mails and/or other means or
instrumentalities of interstate commerce that indicated FMIF was engaged in profitable trading
when, in fact, Defendants conducted no trading at all for the FMIF pool.

30. Asan agent of FMIF, Tripode received total net payments of $203,090.01 from
FMIF. As the scheme started to collapse and FMIF ceased making regular payments to
participants, as noted above Tripode personally returned a total of $32,374.00 to a number of
participants. Thus, Tripode netted $170,716.01 from his work as an agent of FMIF.

B. Conclusions of Law
1. Jurisdiction and Venue

31. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 7 U.S.C. §§ 2(c)(2) and
13a-1 (2012). 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1 provides that whenever it shall appear to the Commission that
any person has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a
violations of any provision of the CEA or any rule, regulation, or order promulgated thereunder,

the Commission may bring an action in the proper district court of the United States against such

8
Case Odd-cv-62240.VPQ Document @O Entered on FLSD Docket OU/2o/2016 Page 9 of 22

person to enjoin such act or practice, or to enforce compliance with the CEA, or any rule,
regulation or order thereunder.

32. Venue properly lies with this Court pursuant to 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1(e), because
Tripode resides in this jurisdiction and the acts and practices in violations of the CEA occurred
within this District.

2. Fraud in Connection with Forex

33. 7 ULS.C. §§ 6b(a)(2)(A)-(C) (2012) makes it unlawful for any person, in or in
connection with any order to make or the making of any forex contract that is made, or to be
made, for or on behalf of, or with, any other person, other than on or subject to the rules of a
designated contract market, knowingly, willfully, or recklessly

(A) to cheat or defraud or attempt to cheat or defraud the other person; (B)
willfully to make or cause to be made to the other person any false report
or statement or willfully to enter or cause to be entered for the other
person any false record; or (C) willfully to deceive or attempt to deceive
the other person by any means whatsoever...

34, 17 C.F.R. § 5.2(b) (2014) makes it unlawful knowingly, willfully, or recklessly

retail forex transaction (1) to cheat or defraud or attempt to cheat or
defraud any person; (2) willfully to make or cause to be made to any
person any false report or statement or cause to be entered for any person
any false record; or (3) willfully to deceive or attempt to deceive any
person by any means whatsoever.

35. During the Relevant Period, by the conduct described in paragraphs | through 31

above, Tripode violated 7 U.S.C. § 6b(a)(2)(A)-(C) and 17 C.F.R. § 5.2(b), in or in connection
with an order to make or the making of forex contracts for or on behalf of other persons, by

knowingly, willfully, or recklessly, among other things: (i) misappropriating pool participants’

funds; (ii) making material fraudulent statements and omissions to existing and prospective pool
 

Case O14-cv-62240.VFD Docurnent9O Entered on FLSD Docket O2/29/2016 Page 16 of 22

participants about FMIF’s forex trading and profitability; and (iii) issuing false account reports to
existing and prospective pool participants.
36.  Tripode engaged in the acts and practices described above with reckless disregard

for the truth.

3. Fraud by an Associated Person of a Commodity Pool Operator

37.  7U,S.C. § 60(1) (2012) makes it unlawful

for a[n] ... associated person of a commodity pool operator by use of the
mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, directly or
indirectly—

(A) to employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud any
client or participant or prospective client or participant; or

(B) to engage in any transaction, practice, or course of business
which operates as a fraud or deceit upon any client or
participant or prospective client or participant.

38. 7 USS.C. § la(11) (2012) defines a “commodity pool operator,” in relevant part, as

a person

engaged in a business that is of the nature of a commodity pool,
investment trust, syndicate, or similar form of enterprise, and who, in
connection therewith, solicits, accepts, or receives from others, funds,
securities, or property, either directly or through capital contributions, the
sale of stock or other forms of securities, or otherwise, for the purpose of
trading in commodity interests, including any—

II. [forex] agreement, contract, or transaction...
39. From at least July 16, 201 1' to the end of the Relevant Period, FMIF operated as a

commodity pool operator in that it engaged in a business that is of the nature of an investment

 

' As of July 16, 2011, the statutory definition of a commodity pool operator set forth in
Section 1a(11) of the CEA was amended by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act, Pub, L. 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376, (July 21, 2010), to include commodity pool
operators operating commodity pools that solicit and accept funds for the purpose of trading
forex, in addition to other commodity interests

10
 

Case O:14-cv-6224d0WPD Bocument SQ Entered on FLSD Docket O1/29/2016 Page 11 of 22

trust, syndicate or similar form of enterprise, and in connection therewith, solicited, accepted, or
received funds, securities, or property from others for the purpose of trading forex.

40. From at least July 16, 2011 to the end of the Relevant Period, Tripode was an
agent of FMIF and acted as an associated person of FMIF in that he solicited and accepted funds,
securities, or property for FMIF.

41. From at least July 16, 2011 to the end of the Relevant Period, Tripode (acting as
an associated person of FMIF), through the use of the mails or other means or instrumentalities
of interstate commerce (including through the use of telephone calls and electronic mail with
pool participants and prospective pool participants), violated 7 U.S.C. § 60(1) by knowingly,
willfully, or recklessly (i) misappropriating pool participants’ funds, (ii) making material
fraudulent statements and omissions to existing and prospective pool participants about FMIF’s
forex trading and profitability, including statements published through FMIF’s website, and (iii)
issuing false account reports to existing and prospective pool participants.

42. Tripode engaged in the acts and practices described above with reckless disregard
for the truth.

4, Failure to Register as an Associated Person

43. 7U.S.C. § 6k(2) (2012) and 17 C.F.R. § 5.3(a)(2)(ii) (2014) prohibit persons from
being associated with a commodity pool operator as a partner, officer, employee, consultant, or
agent (or any person occupying a similar status or performing similar functions), in any capacity
that involves the solicitation of funds, securities, or property for participation in a commodity
pool unless such person is registered.

44. 17 C.F.R. § 3.12 (2014) prohibits a person from being associated with a
commodity pool operator unless the person is registered as an associated person of the

sponsoring commodity pool operator.

11
Case O:14-cv-6224d0WPD Bocument9Q Entered on FLSD Docket 01/29/2016 Page 12 of 22

45, As set forth above, from July 16, 2011 to the end of the Relevant Period, Tripode
solicited funds for participation in a commodity pool operated by FMIF. Because Tripode was
not registered as an associated person of FMIF, Tripode violated 7 U.S.C. § 6k(2) and 17 C.F.R.
§§ 3.12 and 5.3(a)(2)(ii).

46. Because Tripode was not registered as an associated person of FMIF, he violated
7 U.S.C. § 6k(2) and 17 C.F.R. §§ 3.12 and 5.3(a)(2)(ii).

47. Unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, there is a reasonable likelihood that
Tripode will continue to engage in the acts and practices alleged in the Complaint and in similar
acts and practices in violations of the CEA and Regulations.

IV. PERMANENT INJUNCTION

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT:
48. Based upon and in connection with the foregoing conduct, pursuant to 7 U.S.C.
§ 13a-1 Tripode is permanently restrained, enjoined, and prohibited from directly or indirectly:

a. cheating or defrauding, or attempting to cheat or defraud, other persons in or in
connection with any order to make, or the making of, any forex contract that is
made, or to be made, for or on behalf of, or with, any other person in violations of
7 U.S.C. § 6b(a)(2)(A)-(C) and 17 C.F.R. § 5.2(b);

b. employing any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud or engaging in any
transaction, practice, or course of business which operates as a fraud or deceit
upon any participant or prospective participant in a commodity pool in violations
of 7 U.S.C. § 60(1); and

c. soliciting funds for or being associated with a commodity pool operator without

being registered in violations of 7 U.S.C. § 6k(2) and 17 C.F.R. §§ 3.12 and

5.3(a)(2)(ii).

indirectly:

a, trading on or subject to the rules of any registered entity (as that term is defined in
7 U.S.C. § 1a(40) (2012);

any other officer or employee of any person (as that term is defined in 7 U.S.C.

registered with the Commission except as provided for in 17 C.F.R. § 4.14(a)(9).

Obligation beginning on the date of entry of this Consent Order and shall be determined by using
the Treasury Bill rate prevailing on the date of entry of this Consent Order pursuant to 28 U.S.C.
§ 1961 (2012).

51. To effect payment of the Restitution Obligation and the distribution of any

The annuities listed above shall be surrendered for their cash value, and the funds, minus any
mandatory tax withholding, shall be released to the monitor as directed in this Consent Order
and in an amount to satisfy Tripode’s Restitution Obligation.

53. Tripode shall make Restitution Obligation payments under this Consent Order to
the monitor in the name “Tripode — Restitution Fund” and shall send such Restitution Obligation
payments by electronic funds transfer, or by U.S. postal money order, certified check, bank
cashier’s, or bank money order, to the Office of Administration, National Futures Association,
300 South Riverside Plaza, Suite 1800, Chicago, Illinois 60606 under cover letter that identifies
Tripode as the paying defendant and the name and docket number of this proceeding. Tripode

Financial Officer, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st
Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20581.

54. The monitor shall oversee the Restitution Obligation and shall have the discretion
to determine the manner of distribution of such funds in an equitable fashion to FMIF’s pool
participants identified by the Commission or may defer distribution until such time as the

monitor deems appropriate. In the event that the amount of Restitution Obligation payments to

15
 

Case O:14-cv-62240-WPD Bocurment SQ Entered on FLSD Docket O1/29/2016 Page 16 of 22

the monitor are of a de minimis nature such that the monitor determines that the administrative
cost of making a distribution to eligible pool participants is impractical, the monitor may, in its
discretion, treat such restitution payments as civil monetary penalty payments, which the
monitor shall forward to the Commission following the instructions for civil monetary penalty
payments set forth in Part V.B below.

55. Tripode shall cooperate with the monitor as appropriate to provide such
information as the monitor deems necessary and appropriate to identify FMIF’s pool participants
to whom the monitor, in its sole discretion, may determine to include in any plan for distribution
of any Restitution Obligation payments. Tripode shall execute any documents necessary to
release funds that he may have in any repository, bank, investment or other financial institution,
wherever located, in order to make partial or total payment toward the Restitution Obligation.

56. | The monitor shall provide the Commission at the beginning of each calendar year
with a report detailing the disbursement of funds to FMIF’s pool participants during the previous
year. The monitor shall transmit this report under a cover letter that identifies the name and
docket number of this proceeding to the Chief Financial Officer, Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20581.

57. The amounts payable to each FMIF pool participant shall not limit the ability of
any pool participant from proving that a greater amount is owed from Tripode or any other
person or entity, and nothing herein shall be construed in any way to limit or abridge the rights of
any pool participant that exist under state or common law.

58. Pursuant to Rule 71 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, each FMIF pool
participant who suffered a loss is explicitly made an intended third-party beneficiary of this
