I. INTRODUCTION

On September 30, 2014, Plaintiff United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission

(“CFTC”) filed its Complaint [D.E. #1] and Ex Parte Emergency Motion for a Statutory

Restraining Order (“Motion for SRO”) [D.E. #4] alleging violations of the Commodity Exchange

Act (“Act”), 7 U.S.C. §§ 1 et seq., and Commission Regulations, 17 C.F.R. §§ 1.1 et seq.

The Complaint alleged that, from as early as January 2011 through the date of filing of

the Complaint (“Relevant Period”), Jean Chauvel (“Chauvel”) and Renaud Pierre-Charles

(“Pierrz-Charles”), individually and as principals of Forex Monthly Income Fund, LLC
ase Ood-ow-62240AVPD DocumentS$ Entered on FLSD Docket O2/2T/2015 Page 2 of 32

(“FMIF”), and Robert Tripode (“Tripode”)', individually and as an agent of FMIF, defrauded
more than 100 members of the public (“pool participants”) of more than $1.4 million in
connection with pooled investments in retail off-exchange foreign currency contracts (“forex”).
Specifically, the Complaint alleged violations of 7 U.S.C. §§ 6b(a)(2)(A)-(C), 6k(2), 6m(1), and
60(1) (2012) and 17 C.F.R. §§ 3.12, 4.20, 4.41(a), 5.2(b), 5.3(a)(2)(i) and (ii) (2014), and sought,
inter alia, injunctive relief, disgorgement, restitution and civil monetary penalties.

The answers of Pierre-Charles and FMIF were due on October 22, 2014, and Chauvel’s
answer was due on November 6, 2014. Because Chauvel, Pierre-Charles, and FMIF failed to
answer or otherwise respond to the Complaint, the CFTC filed its Motions for Clerk’s Entry of
Default against Chauvel on November 10, 2014 [D.E. #27], against FMIF on November 17,
2014 |D.E. #31], and against Pierre-Charles on November 24, 2014 [D.E. #33]. The Clerk of the
Court entered the defaults against Chauvel, FMIF, and Pierre-Charles on November 12, 18, and
25, 20:14, respectively [D.E. #29, 32, 34].

The CFTC now has submitted its Application for Entry of Default Judgment, Permanent
Injunction, Civil Monetary Penalty, and Ancillary Equitable Relief Against Defendants FMIF,
Chauvel, and Pierre-Charles (collectively, the “Default Defendants”) pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.
55(b)(2) and Local Rule 7(a)(1)(E). The Court has considered carefully the Complaint, the
allegations of which are well-pled and hereby taken as true, the CFTC’s Application, and all

oppositions thereto, and being fully advised in the premises, hereby:

 

Tripode answered the Complaint on November 17, 2014 [D.E. #30] and, therefore, is not
subject to this Order.
 

Case Odd-cv-62240.VPQ DocumentS9 Entered on FLSD Docket O2/2T/2018S Page 3 of 32

GRANTS the CFTC’s Application and enters this Order finding the Default Defendants
liable as to all violations as alleged in the Complaint and imposing on the Default Defendants a
permanent injunction, registration and trading bans, civil monetary penalties, and ancillary

equitable relief, as more fully described herein.

II. FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an independent federal
regulatory agency that is charged by Congress with the administration and enforcement of the
Act, 7 U.S.C. §§ 1 et seq., and the Regulations promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. §§ 1.1 et seq.

2. Defendant Forex Monthly Income Fund, LLC is a Florida limited liability
company created by Chauvel and Pierre-Charles on January 31, 2011 with a business address of
8362 Fines Blvd, No. 314, Pembroke Pines, FL 33024. FMIF has never been registered with the
Commission in any capacity. On September 27, 2013, FMIF was administratively dissolved by
the State of Florida for failing to file an annual report.

3. Defendant Jean Chauvel is an individual whose last known address was in Miami,
Florida. Chauvel is a principal, officer, and manager of FMIF and is responsible for its acts.
Chauvel has never been registered with the Commission in any capacity.

4. Defendant Renaud Pierre-Charles is an individual residing in Hallendale Beach,
Florida. Pierre-Charles is a principal, officer, and manager of FMIF and is responsible for its
acts. Fierre-Charles has never been registered with the Commission in any capacity.

5. During the Relevant Period, FMIF, by and through Chauvel and Pierre-Charles,
solicited existing and prospective pool participants, by use of the mails and/or other means or

instrumentalities of interstate commerce, to send money to FMIF to trade forex in a commodity
ase Od-ow-62240AVPD DocumentS9 Entered on FLSD Docket O2/2T/2015 Page 4 of 32

pool operated by FMIF. Some of the pool participants solicited were unsophisticated investors,
including senior citizens, who sought higher monthly income on their retirement savings.

6. As part of their solicitation, the Default Defendants represented to prospective
pool participants that FMIF offered a safe investment with steady, guaranteed returns. The
Default Defendants reinforced this belief by providing pool participants a “Schedule of Monthly
Returns” stating the exact amount of each monthly payment the pool participants were to receive
based on the size of their investments.

7. At least some pool participants signed a “Foreign Currency Fund Membership
Agreement” (hereinafter, “Agreement”) provided to them by the Default Defendants. The
Agreement reiterated the guaranteed monthly returns and also provided that either party could
terminate the Agreement and that funds would be refunded upon 60 days written notice.

8. In addition to personally soliciting prospective and existing pool participants, the
Default Defendants solicited pool participants through a website, www.forexmonthlyincomefund-
.com, in which FMIF was described as the “world’s leading and most trusted online investment
opportunity” and “an international investment company which has been efficiently operating in
the Forex market since 2010.” The website also repeated the Default Defendants’ guarantees:
“FMI provides its clients with a fixed monthly income at a predetermined rate, with return of
your initial deposit with a [sic] 60 days written notice.”

9. FMIF’s website offered pool participants four separate “plans” under which they
could participate in the FMIF pool. These plans touted monthly returns on investment from two

to three percent and annual returns from 30 to 50 percent.
Case Odd-cv-62240.VPQ DocumentS9 Entered on FLSD Docket O2/29T/201S Page 5 of 32

10... FMIF’s website also offered an “Affiliate/Referral Program” under which pool
participants and non-participants alike could receive guaranteed payments for referring new pool
participants to the FMIF pool.

11. The Default Defendants’ representations, as described above, prompted at least
100 pool participants to provide FMIF approximately $1.429 million for trading forex in the
purported FMIF pool.

12. During the Relevant Period, Pierre-Charles and Chauvel opened bank accounts in
the name of “Forex Monthly Income Fund” at J.P. Morgan Chase, N.A. (“Morgan Chase’) and
Bank of America, N.A. (“BofA”). Pierre-Charles and Chauvel had sole signatory authority over
these lank accounts.

13. In order to invest, pool participants were instructed to make their checks payable
to FMIF. These checks were deposited by Chauvel and Pierre-Charles into the Morgan Chase or
BofA bank accounts.

14. In opening these bank accounts and accepting funds from pool participants,
Chauvel and Pierre-Charles made no distinction between the purported FMIF pool and FMIF as
the commodity pool operator.

15. During the Relevant Period, the Default Defendants did not open any domestic or
foreign forex trading accounts.

16. Asearly as summer 2012, FMIF was losing its ability to keep up with the
promised monthly payments to pool participants. In a July 2012 letter sent to FMIF pool
participants, Chauvel and Pierre-Charles, identified as the CFO and CEO of FMIF, respectively,

wrote that the pool participants’ “percentages [i.e., the promised returns on investment] are
 

Case Odd-cv-62240.VPO DocumentS9 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/29/2018 Page 6 of 32

temporarily adjusted down due to market conditions...but we expect the situation to back [sic] to
normal within the next 60-90 days.”

17. By early 2013, new deposits from pool participants ceased flowing into FMIF.
Within weeks of receiving the last deposit, the Default Defendants ceased making regular
monttily payments to pool participants. At least as early as fall 2013, some pool participants
demanded that FMIF return their principal payments. Some or all of these demands were not
honored by the Default Defendants, despite the guarantee of withdrawal upon 60 days written
notice.

18. In reality, the Default Defendants’ purported forex pool was a sham. The Default
Defendants knowingly and willfully made, or caused others to make, multiple material
misrepresentations and omissions in their solicitation of existing and prospective pool
participants, including as described above. In making their investment decisions, existing and
prospective pool participants in the FMIF pool relied on the Default Defendants’ material
misrepresentations and omissions, including statements regarding FMIF’s trading activity,
purported profits earned from that trading, and the manner in which pool participants’ funds
would be used.

19. Instead of trading forex and paying the promised returns, the Default Defendants
misappropriated the vast majority of pool participants’ funds. Of the $1,429,018.23 received
from pool participants, the Default Defendants and agent Tripode returned only $420,312.82 to
pool participants in the form of purported monthly profits from forex trading and withdrawals of
principal. The remaining approximately $1,008,705.41 was misappropriated by the Default

Defendants and agent Tripode, including $334,570.45 transferred directly to Chauvel;
Case Odd-cov-62240.VPQ DocumentS9 Entered on FLSD Docket O2/29T/2018 Page 7 of 32

$20,038.00 paid to Pierre-Charles, $203,090.01 paid to agent Tripode, and $484,880.95 in the
form of cash withdrawals and miscellaneous payments to third parties.

20. In order to conceal and perpetuate their fraud, the Default Defendants distributed
false statements to existing and prospective pool participants through the mails and/or other
means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce that indicated the Default Defendants were

engaged in profitable trading when, in fact, they conducted no trading at all for the FMIF pool.

II. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

21. | Whena party against whom a default judgment is sought has failed to plead or
otherwise assert a defense, and that fact has been documented, the clerk shall enter the party’s
default. Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(a). The party seeking the default shall then apply to the court for a
default judgment. Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(b). Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(b)(2) provides that judgment by
default may be entered by a district court against a defendant upon the failure of that defendant
to plead or otherwise defend. CFTC v. Machado, No. 11-22275-Civ, 2012 WL 2994396 at *3
(S.D. Fla.); CFTC v. FX Professional Intern. Solutions, Inc., No. 1:10-cv—22311, 2010 WL
55411150 at *4 (S.D. Fla.); Dunn v. Prudential Ins. Co. of America, No. 8:10-cv—1626, 2011 WL
1298156 at *3-4 (M.D. Fla.); Vaccaro v. Custom Sounds, Inc., No. 3:08-cv-776-J-32, 2009 U.S.
Dist. LEXIS 113982 (M.D. Fla.). The grant or denial of a motion for default judgment lies
within a district court’s sound discretion. Hamm v. DeKalb County, 774 F.2d 1567, 1576 (11th
Cir. 1985). The fact that a defendant may make himself impossible to contact cannot prevent the
entry of default judgment. Florida Physician’s Ins. Co. v. Ehlers, 8 F.3d 780, 784 (11th Cir.
1993). Ifa district court determines that a defendant is in default, then well-pled factual
allegations of the complaint, except those relating to unspecified damages, will be taken as true

and liability is established by the entry of a default. Sampson v. Brewer, Michaels & Kane, LLC,
7
 

ase Ood-ow-62240AVPD DocumentS9 Entered on FLSD Docket O2/1T/2015 Page 8 of 32

No. 6:09-cv—2114—-Orl-31 DAB, 2010 WL 2432084 (M.D. Fla. 2010) (citing Buchanan v.
Bowman, 820 F.2d 359, 361 (11th Cir.1987)); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(b)(6) (effect of failure to
deny an allegation). Moreover, “[iJt is a familiar practice and an exercise of judicial power for a
court pon default, by taking evidence when necessary or by computation from facts of record,
to fix the amount which the plaintiff is lawfully entitled to recover and to give judgment
accorclingly.” Machado, 2012 WL 2994396 at *3 (quoting Pope v. United States, 323 U.S. 1, 12
(1944" (internal quotes omitted)).

22. The Clerk of the Court already has entered defaults against the Default
Defendants [D.E. #29, 32, 34]. As such, in accordance with Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(b)(2), the CFTC’s
allegations in the Complaint against the Default Defendants are deemed to be well-pled and are
taken as true, and a default judgment is hereby entered against the Default Defendants.

A. Jurisdiction

23. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1 (2012)
which provides that whenever it shall appear to the CFTC that any person has engaged, is
engaging, or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a violation of any provision of
the Act or any rule, regulation, or order promulgated thereunder, the CFTC may bring an action
in the proper district court of the United States against such person to enjoin such act or practice,
or to enforce compliance with the Act, or any rule, regulation or order thereunder.

24. — Venue properly lies with the Court pursuant to 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1(e) (2012), in that
the Default Defendants transacted business in the Southern District of Florida and the acts and
practices in violation of the Act and Regulations occurred within this District, among other

places.

B. The Commodity Exchange Act

25. ‘In analyzing the CFTC’s Application, the Court keeps in mind a crucial purpose
of the Act, inter alia, “protecting the innocent individual investor — who may know little about
the intricacies and complexities of the commodities market — from being misled or deceived.”
CFTC v. RJ. Fitzgerald & Co., 310 F.3d 1321, 1329 (11th Cir. 2002). “{C/Javeat emptor has no
place in the realm of federal commodities fraud. Congress, the CFTC, and the Judiciary have
determined that customers must be zealously protected from deceptive statements by brokers

who <leal in these highly complex and inherently risky financial instruments.” /d, at 1334.

Cc. Violations of 7 U.S.C. §§ 6b(a)(2)(A)-(C) and 17 C.F.R. § 5.2(b)
26. 7U.S.C. §§ 6b(a)(2)(A)-(C) (2012) make it unlawful for any person:

in or in connection with any order to make, or the making of, any
contract of sale of any commodity for future delivery ... (A) to
cheat or defraud or attempt to cheat or defraud the other person;
(B) willfully to make or cause to be made to the other person any
false report or statement or willfully to enter or cause to be entered
for the other person any false record; [or] (C) willfully to deceive
or attempt to deceive the other person by any means whatsoever...

27. 17 C.F.R. § 5.2(b) (2014) makes it unlawful for any person:

by use of the mails or by any means or instrumentality of interstate
commerce, directly or indirectly, in or in connection with any retail
forex transaction (1) to cheat or defraud or attempt to cheat or
defraud any person; (2) willfully to make or cause to be made to
any person any false report or statement or cause to be entered for
any person any false record; or (3) willfully to deceive or attempt
to deceive any person by any means whatsoever.

28. The Default Defendants, through their willful misappropriation of pool participant
funds, fraudulent sales solicitations, and issuance of false statements, violated 7 U.S.C. 8§

6b(a)(2)(A)-(C) and 17 C.F.R. § 5.2(b).
Case O:14-cyv-62240-WPD Document 39 Entered on FLSD Docket 0291/2015 Page 16 of 32

1, Fraud by Misappropriation

29. Misappropriation of customer funds constitutes “willful and blatant fraudulent
activity” in violation of 7 U.S.C. §§ 6b(a)(2)(A) and (C). CFTC v. Noble Wealth Data Info.
Serv., Inc., 90 F. Supp. 2d 676, 687, (D. Md. 2000) (defendants violated Section 6b(a) by
diverting investor funds for operating expenses and personal use), aff'd sub nom. CFTC v.
Barayosh, 278 F.3d 319 (4th Cir. 2002); see also CFTC v. Skorupskas, 605 F. Supp. 923, 932
(E.D. Mich. 1985) (holding that defendant violated Section 6b when she misappropriated
customer funds by soliciting funds for trading and then trading only a small percentage of those
funds, while disbursing the rest of the funds to investors, herself, and her family); CFTC v.
Weinberg, 287 F. Supp. 2d. 1100, 1106 (C.D. Cal. 2003) (misappropriating investor funds
violated Section 6b(a)); Jn re Slusser, [1998-1999 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) 4
27,701 at 48,315 (CFTC July 19, 1999), aff'd in relevant part sub nom. Slusser v. CFTC, 210
F.3d “'83 (7th Cir. 2000) (respondents violated Section 6b by surreptitiously retaining money in
their own bank accounts that should have been traded on behalf of participants); CFTC v. King,
No. 3:06-CV-1583-M, 2007 WL 1321762, at *2 (N.D. Tex. May 7, 2007) (“King’s violation of
section [6b(a)] is further proven by his admitted misappropriation of customer funds for personal
and professional use”); CFTC v. McLaurin, [1994-1996 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep.
(CCH) § 26,768 at 44,180 (N.D. III. 1996) (by depositing customer funds in accounts in which
the customers had no ownership interest and making unauthorized disbursements for his own
use, defendant violated Section 6b).

30. During the Relevant Period, the Default Defendants violated 7 U.S.C. §§
6b(a)(2)(A) and (C) and 17 C.F.R. § 5.2(b) by willfully misappropriating pool participant funds.

Specifically, of the $1,429,018.23 provided by pool participants to the Default Defendants for

10
Case O:14-cv-6224d0.WPD Document 39 Entered on FLSD Docket O291/2015 Page 11 of 32

trading forex, the record reflects that only $420,312.82 was returned to pool participants. The

remaining funds were misappropriated by the Default Defendants.

2. Fraud by Misrepresentations and Omissions to Existing
and Prospective Pool Participants

31. To establish that the Default Defendants violated 7 U.S.C. §§ 6b(a)(2)(A) and (C)
and 17 C.F.R. § 5.2(b) through misrepresentations and omissions, the CFTC must prove that 1) a
misrepresentation or omission was made, 2) with scienter; and 3) that the misrepresentation or
omission was material. R.J. Fitzgerald & Co., 310 F. 3d at 1328-29. Scienter requires proof that
a defendant committed the alleged wrongful acts “intentionally or with reckless disregard for his
duties under the Act.” Drexel Burnham Lambert, Inc. v. CFTC, 850 F.2d 742, 748 (D.C. Cir.
1988); see also Do v. Lind-Waldock & Co. [1994-1996 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep.
(CCH) ¥ 25,516 at 43,321 (CFTC Sept. 27, 1995) (determining that a reckless act is one where
there is so little care that it is “difficult to believe the [actor] was not aware of what he was
doing’). A statement is material if “it is substantially likely that a reasonable investor would
consider the matter important in making an investment decision.” RJ. Fitzgerald, 310 F.3d at
1328 (internal quotation omitted). Any fact that enables investors to assess independently the
risk inherent in their investment and the likelihood of profit is a material fact. In re Commodities
Int'l Corp., [1996-1998 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) § 26,943, at 44,563-64
(CFTC Jan. 14, 1997). Moreover, a material misrepresentation or omission is a violation
whether or not it induces investor action or inaction; rather, it is sufficient that a material
misrepresentation or omission is made to “attempt to cheat or defraud” or willfully to “attempt to
deceive” a person. See CFTC v. Int'l Fin. Servs., 323 F. Supp. 2d 482, 502 (S.D.N.Y. 2004)
(investor reliance need not be proven in an enforcement action alleging fraud) (citing S/usser v.

CFTC, 210 F.3d 783, 785-86 (7th Cir 2000)).
1]
Case O:14-cv-62240-WPD Document 39 Entered on FLSD Docket O21/2015 Page 12 of 32

32. As described above, the evidence demonstrates that during the Relevant Period
Chauvel and Pierre-Charles, individually and on behalf of FMIF, lied to existing and prospective
pool participants that they were making and would make large profits and that pool participants
woul: receive guaranteed returns on their investments, Chauvel and Pierre-Charles willfully or
with reckless disregard of the truth made these misrepresentations and omissions in order to
induce participants to invest with the Default Defendants. These misrepresentations and
omissions are material in that a reasonable pool participant would want to know, among other
things, that the Default Defendants had not opened forex trading accounts and that they never
generated any trading profits. Accordingly, each of the elements of fraud by misrepresentation
and omission is met in this case, and the Default Defendants therefore violated 7 U.S.C. §§
6b(a)(2)(A) and (C) and 17 C.F.R. § 5.2(b).

3. Fraud by False Statements

33. Delivering, or causing the delivery of, false statements to participants relating to
forex trades (or other transactions regulated by the CFTC) constitutes a violation of 7 U.S.C. §
6b(a)(2)(B) and, by definition, 17 C.F.R. § 5.2(b). See, e.g., CFTC v. Skorupskas, 605 F. Supp.
at 932-33 (finding that defendant violated Section 6b(a) of the Act by issuing false monthly
statements to customers); CFTC v. Sorkin, [1982-1984 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep.
(CCH) § 21,855 at 27,585 (S.D.N.Y. August 25, 1983) (determining that distribution of false
account statements which falsely report trading activity or equity is a violation of Sections 60
and 6l) of the Act); Weinberg, 287 F. Supp. 2d. at 1107 (false and misleading statements as to the
amount and location of investors’ money violated Section 6b(a)); Noble Wealth , 90 F. Supp. 2d

at 685-87 (defendants violated Section 6b(a) through the delivery of false account statements).

12
Case O:14-cv-62240-WPD Document 39 Entered on FLSD Docket 0291/2015 Page 15 of 32

34. | During the Relevant Period, the Default Defendants violated 7 U.S.C. §
6b(a)(2)(B) and 17 C.F.R. § 5.2(b) by willfully sending account statements stating their
purpcrted monthly returns and publishing promotional material to pool participants and others on
their website that misrepresented their trading performance and their ability to pay the promised

returris.

D. Violations of 7 U.S.C. § 60(1) and 17 C.F.R. § 4.41 (a)
35. 7U.S.C. § 60(1) (2012) makes it unlawful:

for a... commodity pool operator, or associated person of a commodity
pool operator by use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of
interstate commerce, directly or indirectly—

(A) — to employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud any client or
participant or prospective client or participant; or

(B) to engage in any transaction, practice, or course of business which
operates as a fraud or deceit upon any client or participant or
prospective client or participant.

36. 17 C.F.R. § 4.41(a) (2014) makes it unlawful for any commodity pool operator or
any principal thereof to publish, distribute, or broadcast, whether by electronic media or
otherwise, any report, letter, writing, or other literature which:

(1) Employs any device, scheme or artifice to defraud any participant
or client or prospective participant or client; [or]
(2) Involves any transaction, practice or course of business which

operates as a fraud or deceit upon any participant or client or any
prospective participant or client.

37.  7U,S.C. § 1a(11) (2012) defines a “commodity pool operator,” in relevant part, as
a person
engaged in a business that is of the nature of a commodity pool,
investment trust, syndicate, or similar form of enterprise, and who, in

connection therewith, solicits, accepts, or receives from others, funds,
securities, or property, either directly or through capital contributions, the

13
Case O:14-cv-62240-WPD Bocument 39 Entered on FLSD Docket 0291/2015 Page 14 of 32

sale of stock or other forms of securities, or otherwise, for the purpose of
trading in commodity interests, including any—

II. [forex] agreement, contract, or transaction...

38. Unlike 17 U.S.C. §§ 6b(a) and 60(1)(A), the language of Section 60(1)(B) does
not require “knowing” or “willful” conduct as a prerequisite for establishing liability. See, e.g.,
Messer v. E.F. Hutton & Co., 847 F.2d 673, 678-79 (11th Cir. 1988). Section 60 applies to all
commodity pool operators, whether registered, required to be registered, or exempted from
registration. See, e.g., CFTC v. Skorupskas, 605 F. Supp. at 932. The same conduct that
constitutes violations of Section 6b(a), as described above, constitutes violations of Section 60.
See, e.g., CFTC v. Skorupskas, 605 F. Supp. at 932-33.

39. From at least July 16, 20117 to the present, FMIF operated as a commodity pool
operator in that it engaged in a business that is of the nature of an investment trust, syndicate or
similar form of enterprise, and in connection therewith, solicited, accepted, or received funds,
securities, or property from others for the purpose of trading forex.

40. From at least July 16, 2011 to the present, Chauvel and Pierre-Charles were
principals and/or agents of FMIF and acted as associated persons of FMIF in that they solicited
and accepted funds, securities, or property for FMIF.

41. From at least July 16, 2011 to the present, FMIF (acting as a commodity pool

operator) and Chauvel and Pierre-Charles (acting as associated persons of FMIF), through the

 

2 As of July 16, 2011, the statutory definition of a commodity pool operator set forth in 7

U.S.C. § 1a(11) was amended by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection
Act, Pub.L. 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376, July 21, 2010), to include commodity pool operators
operating commodity pools that solicit and accept funds for the purpose of trading forex, in
addition to other commodity interests.

14
Case O:14-cv-62240-WPD Document 39 Entered on FLSD Docket 0291/2015 Page 15 of 32

use of the mails or other means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce (including through
the use of telephone calls and electronic mail with pool participants and prospective pool
participants), violated 7 U.S.C. § 60(1) (2012) by knowingly (i) misappropriating pool
participants’ funds, (ii) making material fraudulent statements and omissions to existing and
prospective pool participants about FMIF’s forex trading and profitability, including statements
published through FMIF’s website, and (iii) issuing false account reports to existing and
prospective pool participants.

42. From at least July 16, 2011 to the present, FMIF (acting as a commodity pool
operator) and Chauvel and Pierre-Charles (acting as principals of FMIF) violated 17 C.F.R. §
4.41(a) (2014) by knowingly (i) misappropriating pool participants’ funds, (ii) making material
fraudulent statements and omissions to existing and prospective pool participants about FMIF’s
forex trading and profitability, including statements published through FMIF’s website, and (iii)

issuing false account reports to existing and prospective pool participants.

E. Violations of 7 U.S.C § 6m(1) and 17 C.F.R. § 5.3(a)(2)(i)
43, 7 U.S.C § 6m(1) (2012) provides that it is unlawful for any commodity pool

operator, unless registered, to make use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate
commerce in connection with its business as a commodity pool operator.

44, Similarly, 17 C.F.R. § 5.3(a)(2)(i) (2014) provides that any commodity pool
operator, as defined in 17 C.F.R. § 5.1(d)(1), is required to register as a commodity pool
operator. 17 C.F.R. § 5.1(d)(1) (2014) defines a commodity pool operator as anyone who
“operates or solicits funds... for a pooled investment vehicle... that engages in retail forex

transactions.”

15
Case O:14-cv-62240-WPD Document 39 Entered on FLSD Docket O21/2015 Page 16 of 32

45. Asset forth above, from July 16, 2011 to the present, FMIF, by and through its
employees, agents, and control persons, including Chauvel and Pierre-Charles, used the mails or
instrumentalities of interstate commerce in or in connection with a commodity pool as a
commodity pool operator while failing to register as a commodity pool operator, in violation of 7
U.S.C. § 6m(1) (2012).

46. As set forth above, during the Relevant Period, FMIF, by and through its
emplayees, agents, and control persons, including Chauvel and Pierre-Charles, solicited funds
for a pooled investment vehicle that engaged in retail forex transactions while failing to register
as a commodity pool operator, in violation of 17 C.F.R. § 5.3(a)(2)(i) (2014).

F, Violations of 7 U.S.C. § 6k(2) and 17 C.F.R.

 

47. 7 U.S.C. § 6k(2) (2012) and 17 C.F.R. § 5.3(a)(2)(ii) (2014) prohibit persons from
being associated with a commodity pool operator as a partner, officer, employee, consultant, or
agent ‘or any person occupying a similar status or performing similar functions), in any capacity
that involves (i) the solicitation of funds, securities, or property for participation in a commodity
pool, or (ii) the supervision of any person or persons so engaged, unless such person is
registered.

48. 7U.S.C. § 6k(2)(ii) (2012) further prohibits commodity pool operators from
permitting such persons to become or remain associated with the commodity pool operator if the
commodity pool operator knew or should have known that such persons were not so registered.

49. 17 C.F.R. § 3.12 (2014) prohibits a person from being associated with a
commodity pool operator unless the person is registered as an associated person of the

sponscring commodity pool operator.

16
Case O:14-cv-62240-WPD Document 39 Entered on FLSD Docket 0291/2015 Page 1? of 32

50. As set forth above, from July 16, 2011 to the present, Chauvel and Pierre-Charles
solicited funds for participation in a commodity pool operated by FMIF and/or supervised
persons so engaged. Because Chauvel and Pierre-Charles were not registered as associated
persons of FMIF, Chauvel and Pierre-Charles violated 7 U.S.C. § 6k(2) (2012) and 17 C.F.R. §§
3.12 and 5.3(a)(2)(ii) (2014).

51. As set forth above, FMIF, by and through its employees, agents, and control
persons, permitted Chauvel and Pierre-Charles, among others, to become or remain associated
with FMIF knowing that they were not registered as associated persons, in violation of 7 U.S.C.
§ 6k(2)(ii) (2012).

G. Violations of 17 C.F.R. §§ 4.20(a) and (b)

52. 17 C.F.R. § 4.20(a) (2014) provides that a commodity pool operator “must
operate its pool as an entity cognizable as a legal entity separate from that of the pool operator.”
17 C.F.R. § 4.20(b) (2014) provides that all funds received by a commodity pool operator from
pool participants must be received in the name of the pool.

53. During the Relevant Period, FMIF failed to operate the purported pool as a legal
entity separate from itself, the commodity pool operator. Instead, the Default Defendants
referred to the pool operator and the pool by the same name. In addition, FMIF accepted funds
from pool participants in the name of FMIF, the commodity pool operator, rather than in the
name of an FMIF pool and made no distinction as to which bank accounts belonged to FMIF the
commniodity pool operator and which belonged to an FMIF pool. Therefore, FMIF violated 17

C.F.R.. §§ 4.20(a) and (b) (2014).

H. Chauvel and Pierre-Charles are Liable as Controlling Persons

54, Chauvel and Pierre-Charles controlled FMIF and, as controlling persons, are

liable for FMIF’s violations pursuant to 7 U.S.C. § 13c(b) (2012), which provides that:

Any person who, directly or indirectly, controls any person who

has violated any provision of this Act or any of the rules,

regulations, or orders issued pursuant to this Act may be held liable

for such violation in any action brought by the Commission to the

same extent as such controlled person. In such action, the

Commission has the burden of proving that the controlling person

did not act in good faith or knowingly induced, directly or
indirectly, the act or acts constituting the violation.

A “fundamental purpose” of the statute is “to reach behind the corporate entity to the controlling
individuals of the corporation and to impose liability for violations of the Act directly on such
individuals as well as on the corporation itself.” RJ. Fitzgerald & Co., 310 F.3d at 1334
(quoting JCC, Inc. v. CFTC, 63 F.3d 1557, 1567 (11th Cir. 1995) (internal quotation marks and
citation omitted)).

55. To establish controlling person liability under 7 U.S.C. § 13c(b) (2012), the CFTC
must show both (1) control and (2) lack of good faith or knowing inducement of the acts
constituting the violation. Jn re First Nat’l Trading Corp., [1992-1994 Transfer Binder] Comm.
Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) 4 26,142, at 41,787 (CFTC July 20, 1994), aff'd without opinion sub nom.
Pick vy. CFTC, 99 F.3d 1139 (6th Cir. 1996). To establish the first element, control, a defendant
must possess general control over the operation of the entity principally liable. See, e.g., RJ.
Fitzgerald, 310 F.3d at 1334 (recognizing an individual who “exercised the ultimate choice-
making power within the firm regarding its business decisions” as a controlling person).
Evidence that a defendant is an officer, founder, principal, or the authorized signatory on the
company’s bank accounts indicates the power to control a company. Jn re Spiegel, [1987-1990
Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) § 24,103, at 34,767 (CFTC Jan. 12, 1988); see also

18
Case O:14-cv-6224d0.WPD Bocument 39 Entered on FLSD Docket O21/2015 Page 19 of 32

Apache Trading Corp., [1990-1992 Transfer Binder] Comm, Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) § 25,251, at
38,7°5 (CFTC Mar. 11, 1992) (finding that an individual who “maintained control over the
economic aspects of the operations” of a firm was a controlling person of it).

56. To establish the “knowing inducement” element of the controlling person
violation, the CFTC must show that “the controlling person had actual or constructive knowledge
of the: core activities that constitute the violations at issue and allowed them to continue.” JCC,
Inc. v. CFTC, 63 F.3d at 1568 (quoting Jn re Spiegel, [1987-1990 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut.
L. Rep. (CCH) 4 24,103, at 34,767 (CFTC Jan. 12, 1988)). Controlling persons cannot avoid
liability by deliberately or recklessly avoiding knowledge about potential wrongdoing. In re
Spiegel, § 24,103, at 34,767. Indeed, constructive knowledge of wrongdoing is sufficient for a
finding of knowing inducement. See JCC, Inc., 63 F.3d at 1568. To support a finding of
constructive knowledge, the CFTC must show that a defendant “lacked actual knowledge only
because he consciously avoided it.” Jd. at 1569 (citations omitted).

57. As described above, at all material times, Chauvel and Pierre-Charles controlled
FMIF and the bank accounts in which pool participant funds were deposited and, therefore, had
actual knowledge of the activities that constituted the violations described above. Chauvel and
Pierre-Charles are the founders and managers of FMIF and its sole principals and officers.
Chauvel and Pierre-Charles solicited participants to trade through FMIF. Chauvel and Pierre-
Charlzs corresponded with participants regarding their accounts and knowingly caused the false
statements to be sent to participants. Chauvel and Pierre-Charles, thus, had the requisite control
of FMIF, knew of the fraudulent acts, and allowed them to continue. Chauvel and Pierre-
Charles, therefore, are liable pursuant to 7 U.S.C. § 13c(b) (2012) for FMIF’s violations

described above.

19
Case O:14-cv-62240-WPD Document 39 Entered on FLSD Docket O21/2015 Page 20 of 32

I. FMIF is Liable for the Acts of its Agents
58. 7 US.C. § 2(a)(1)(B) (2012) and 17 C.F.R. § 1.2 (2014) provide, inter alia, that

the act or omission of any agent or other person acting for a corporation within the scope of his
employment shall be deemed the act or omission of such corporation as well as of such agent or
other person. As described above, Chauvel and Pierre-Charles, who were the founders and sole
managers of FMIF, committed the acts and omissions described herein within the course and
scope of their employment at FMIF. Therefore, FMIF is liable under 7 U.S.C. § 2(a)(1)(B)
(2012) and 17 C.F.R. § 1.2 (2014) for Chauvel’s and Pierre-Charles’ violations described above.

See CFTC vy. Sidoti, 178 F.3d 1132, 1135-36 (11th Cir. 1999).

IV. REMEDIES

A, Permanent Injunction Against the Default Defendants
59. 7U.S.C. § 13a-1 (2012) authorizes and directs the CFTC to enforce the Act and

Regulations and allows a district court, upon a proper showing, to grant a permanent injunction.
CFTC v. Wilshire Inv. Mgmt. Corp., 531 F.3d 1339, 1346 (11th Cir. 2008). 7 U.S.C. § 13a-l
(2012) states in relevant part:

(a) Whenever it shall appear to the Commission that any registered
entity or other person has engaged, is engaging, or is about to
engage in any act or practice constituting a violation of any
provision of this Act or any rule, regulation or order, thereunder . .
. the Commission may bring an action in the proper district court
of the United States . . . to enjoin such act or practice, or to enforce
compliance with this Act, or any rule, regulation or order
thereunder...

20
Case O:14-cv-62240-WPD Document 39 Entered on FLSD Docket O291/2015 Page 21 of 32

60. The CFTC is entitled to injunctive relief upon a showing that a violation has occurred

and is likely to continue unless enjoined. CFTC v. Sidoti, 178 F.3d at 1137; CFTC v. Muller, 570

F.2d 1296, 1300 (Sth Cir. 1978); CFTC v. Hunt, 591 F.2d 1211, 1220 (7th Cir. 1979), cert denied,
442 U.S. 921 (1979); CFTC v. British American Commodity Options Corp., 560 F.2d 135, 141 (2nd
Cir. 1977); SEC v. Unique Financial Concepts, Inc., 196 F.3d 1195, 1199 n.2 (11th Cir. 1999).

61. ‘In analyzing whether future violations are likely to occur, a district court may
infer a likelihood of future violations from the defendant’s past unlawful conduct. See SEC v.
Carriba Air, Inc., 681 F.2d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.1982); CFTC v. Am. Bd. of Trade, Inc., 803
F.2d 1242, 1250-51 (2d Cir. 1986); CFTC v. Heritage Capital Advisory Services, Ltd., [1982-1984
Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. § 21,627 at 26,385 (N.D. IIl.1982). Such an inference is
approoriate because “past illegal conduct is highly suggestive of the likelihood of future violations.”
CFTC v. Crown Colony Commodity Options, Ltd., 434 F. Supp. 911, 919 (S.D.N.Y. 1977); Hunt,
591 F.2d at 1220; British American, 560 F.2d at 142.

62. The scope of the injunctive relief can be tailored to meet the circumstances of the
violations shown. See, e.g., Wilshire Inv. Mgmt. Corp., 531 F.3d at 1346 (upholding the district
court’s permanent injunction prohibiting the defendants from “engaging in any commodity-
related activity”); see also Noble Wealth Data Info. Servs., 90 F. Supp. 2d at 692 (‘[t]he
pervasiveness and seriousness of [the defendant’s] violation justify the issuance of a permanent
injunction prohibiting him from violating the Act and from engaging in any commodity-related

activity, including soliciting customers and funds’’). Under these standards, permanent

 

3 The Eleventh Circuit adopted as binding precedent all Fifth Circuit decisions that were

handed down prior to the close of business on September 30, 1981. Bonner v. City of Prichard,
661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc).

21
Case O:14-cv-62240.WPD Document 39 Entered on FLSD Docket O291/2015 Page 22 of 32

injunctive relief, including a comprehensive trading and registration ban, is clearly warranted
against the Default Defendants.

63. Based on the Default Defendants’ conduct and pursuant to 7 U.S.C. § 13a-l
(2012), the Default Defendants are permanently restrained, enjoined and prohibited from directly
or indirectly:

a) cheating or defrauding, or attempting to cheat or defraud, other persons in
or in connection with any order to make, or the making of, any forex contract that is
made, or to be made, for or on behalf of, or with, any other person in violation of 7
U.S.C. § 6b(a)(2)(A)-(C) (2012) and 17 C.F.R. § 5.2(b) (2014);

b) employing any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud or engaging in any
transaction, practice, or course of business which operates as a fraud or deceit upon any
participant or prospective participant in a commodity pool in violation of 7 U.S.C. §
60(1) and 17 C.F.R. § 4.41 (a);

c) acting as a commodity pool operator without being registered in violation
of 7 U.S.C. § 6m(1) and 17 C.F.R. §5.3(a)(2)(i) (2014);

d) soliciting funds for or being associated with a commodity pool operator
without being registered in violation of 7 U.S.C. § 6k(2) and 17 C.F.R. §§ 3.12 and
5.3(a)(2)(ii); and

e) failing to operate a pool as a legal entity separate from the commodity
pool operator and accepting funds from pool participants in the name of the pool operator
rather than in the name of the pool in violation of 17 C.F.R. §§ 4.20(a) and (b) (2014).
64. | The Default Defendants are also permanently restrained, enjoined and prohibited

from directly or indirectly:

22
Case O:14-cv-62240.WPD Document 39 Entered on FLSD Docket O21/2015 Page 25 of 32

a. trading on or subject to the rules of any registered entity (as that term is
defined in 7 U.S.C. § 1a(40) (2012));

b. entering into any “commodity interests” (as that term is defined in 17
C.F.R. § 1.3(yy) (2014)) for their own personal account or for any account in which they
have a direct or indirect interest;

c. having any commodity interests traded on their behalf;

d. controlling or directing the trading for or on behalf of any other person or
entity, whether by power of attorney or otherwise, in any account involving commodity
interests;

€. soliciting, receiving, or accepting any funds from any person for the
purpose of purchasing or selling any commodity interests;

f. applying for registration or claiming exemption from registration with the
CFTC in any capacity, and engaging in any activity requiring such registration or
exemption from registration with the CFTC, except as provided for in 17 C.F.R. §
4.14(a)(9) (2014); and/or

g. acting as a principal (as that term is defined in 17 C.F.R. § 3.1(a) (2014)),
agent or any other officer or employee of any person (as that term is defined in 7 U.S.C.
§ 1a(38) (2012)) registered, exempted from registration or required to be registered with
the Commission except as provided for in 17 C.F.R. § 4.14(a)(9) (2014).

B. Restitution

65. In acivil enforcement action brought pursuant to 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1 (2012), the
district court may order equitable relief in the form of restitution. A district court has broad

discretion in determining equitable remedies to be imposed upon a finding of violation of the

23
Case O:14-cv-62240-WPD Document 39 Entered on FLSD Docket 0291/2015 Page 24 of 32

Act. Indeed, “the unqualified grant of statutory authority to issue an injunction under [7 U.S.C.]
§ 13a—-1 carries with it the full range of equitable remedies.” CFTC v. Wilshire Inv. Mgmt. Corp.,
531 F.3d 1339, 1344 (11th Cir, 2008). Included within that range of equitable remedies “is the
power to grant restitution.” Jd, Prior to July 16, 2011, the Court’s authority to order restitution in
such vases was founded on the well-established legal principle articulated by the Supreme Court
in Porter v. Warner Holding Co., 328 U.S. 395, 398 (1946):

Unless otherwise provided by statute, all the inherent equitable

powers of the District Court are available for the proper and

complete exercise of that jurisdiction. And since the public

interest is involved in a proceeding of this nature, those equitable

powers assume an even broader power and more flexible character

than when a private controversy is at stake. Power is thereby

resident in the District Court, in exercising this jurisdiction, “to do

equity and to mould each decree to the necessities of the particular

case.”

66. The Supreme Court reaffirmed this principle in Mitchell v. Robert De Mario
Jewelry, Inc., 361 U.S. 288 (1960), where it recognized that “’the comprehensiveness of [the
court’s] equitable jurisdiction is not to be denied or limited in the absence of a clear and valid
legislative command. Unless a statute in so many words, or by a necessary and inescapable
reference, restricts the court’s jurisdiction in equity, the full scope of that jurisdiction is to be
recognized and applied.’” Jd. at 291 (quoting Porter, 328 U.S. at 398).

67. The Eleventh Circuit has followed these principles in granting broad equitable
powers to district courts in enforcement matters brought by federal agencies. See, e.g., Wilshire
Inv. Mgmt. Corp., 531 F.3d at 1344; see also CFTC v. Kimberlynn Creek Ranch, Inc., 276 F.3d
187, 193 (4th Cir. 2002) (“‘It is well settled that equitable remedies such as disgorgement are

available to remedy violations of the [Act]”); United States v. Universal Mgmt. Servs., Inc., 191

F.3d 7'50, 760-61 (6th Cir. 1999) (“{rJestitution and disgorgement are part of the court’s

24
Case O:14-cv-62240.WPD Document 39 Entered on FLSD Docket O291/2015 Page 25 of 32

traditional equitable authority”). In the absence of a statutorily provided remedy, Eleventh
Circuit courts measure restitution by the defendant’s unjust gain. See Wilshire Inv. Mgmt. Corp.,
531 F.3d at 1345; CFTC v. Levy, 541 F.3d 1102, 1113 (11th Cir. 2008).
68. On July 16, 2011, newly added subsection (d)(3) of 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1 became

effective. This section provides in relevant part:

(3) Equitable remedies

In any action brought under this section, the Commission may seek, and the

court may impose, on a proper showing, on any person found in the action to

have committed any violation, equitable remedies including—

(A) restitution to persons who have sustained losses proximately caused by such
violation (in the amount of such losses).

7 U.S.C. § 13a-1(d)(3) (2012) (emphasis added). Therefore, for violations of the Act and
Regulations occurring on or after July 16, 2011, the measure of restitution is determined by the
amount of the pool participants’ losses rather than the defendant’s unjust enrichment.

69. In this case, the total amount of participant funds misappropriated by the Default
Defendants is equal to the total amount of losses incurred by participants and is calculated with
straightforward arithmetic, i.e. $1,429,018.23 (the amount taken in from participants) minus
$420,312.82 (the amount returned to participants) equals $1,008,705.41 (the amount
misappropriated from/lost by participants).

70. Accordingly, this Court orders the Default Defendants to pay, jointly and
severally, restitution in the amount of $1,008,705.41, plus post-judgment interest (the
“Restitution Obligation”). Post-judgment interest on the Restitution Obligation shall accrue
beginning on the date of entry of this Order and shall be determined by using the Treasury Bill

rate prevailing on the date of entry of this Order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1961 (2012).

25
Case O:14-cv-62240-WPD Document 39 Entered on FLSD Docket O21/2015 Page 26 of 32

71. To effect payment of the Restitution Obligation and the distribution of any
restitution payments to FMIF’s pool participants, the Court appoints the National Futures
Assoviation (“NFA”) as Monitor (“Monitor”), The Monitor shall collect restitution payments
from the Default Defendants and make distributions as set forth below. Because the Monitor is
acting as an officer of this Court in performing these services, the NFA shall not be liable for any
action or inaction arising from NFA’s appointment as Monitor, other than actions involving
fraud.

72. The Default Defendants shall make Restitution Obligation payments under this
Consent Order to the Monitor in the name “[NAME OF DEFENDANT] - FMIF Restitution
Fund” and shall send such Restitution Obligation payments by electronic funds transfer, or by
U.S. postal money order, certified check, bank cashier’s, or bank money order, to the Office of
Administration, National Futures Association, 300 South Riverside Plaza, Suite 1800, Chicago,
Illinois 60606 under cover letter that identifies the paying Defendant and the name and docket
number of this proceeding. The Default Defendants shall simultaneously transmit copies of the
cover letter and the form of payment to the Chief Financial Officer, Commodity Futures Trading
Commnission, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20581.

73. The Monitor shall oversee the Restitution Obligation and shall have the discretion
to determine the manner of distribution of such funds in an equitable fashion to FMIF’s pool
participants identified by the Commission or may defer distribution until such time as the
Monitor deems appropriate. In the event that the amount of Restitution Obligation payments to
the Monitor are of a de minimis nature such that the Monitor determines that the administrative
cost of making a distribution to eligible pool participants is impractical, the Monitor may, in its

discretion, treat such restitution payments as civil monetary penalty payments, which the

26
Case O:14-cv-62240.WPD Document 39 Entered on FLSD Docket O21/2015 Page 27 of 32

Monitor shall forward to the Commission following the instructions for civil monetary penalty
payments set forth in Part IV.C below.

74. The Default Defendants shall cooperate with the Monitor as appropriate to
provide such information as the Monitor deems necessary and appropriate to identify FMIF’s
pool participants to whom the Monitor, in its sole discretion, may determine to include in any
plan ‘or distribution of any Restitution Obligation payments. The Default Defendants shall
execuite any documents necessary to release funds that he may have in any repository, bank,
investment or other financial institution, wherever located, in order to make partial or total
payment toward the Restitution Obligation.

75. The Monitor shall provide the Commission at the beginning of each calendar year
with a report detailing the disbursement of funds to FMIF’s pool participants during the previous
year. The Monitor shall transmit this report under a cover letter that identifies the name and
docket number of this proceeding to the Chief Financial Officer, Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20581.

76. | The amounts payable to each FMIF pool participant shall not limit the ability of
any pool participant from proving that a greater amount is owed from the Default Defendants or
any other person or entity, and nothing herein shall be construed in any way to limit or abridge
the rights of any pool participant that exist under state or common law.

77. Pursuant to Rule 71 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, each FMIF pool
participant who suffered a loss is explicitly made an intended third-party beneficiary of this
Consent Order and may seek to enforce obedience of this Consent Order to obtain satisfaction of

any portion of the restitution that has not been paid by the Default Defendants to ensure

27
Case O:14-cv-6224d0-WPD Document 39 Entered on FLSD Docket O21/2015 Page 25 of 32

continued compliance with any provision of this Consent Order and to hold the Default
Defendants in contempt for any violations of any provision of this Consent Order.

78. To the extent that any funds accrue to the U.S. Treasury for satisfaction of the
Default Defendants’ Restitution Obligation, such funds shall be transferred to the Monitor for

Cc. Civil Monetary Penalties
79, 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1(d)(1) (2012) provides that “the [CFTC] may seek and the court

shall have jurisdiction to impose, on a proper showing, on any person found in the action to have
comnnitted any violation [of the Act or Regulations] a civil penalty.” Pursuant to 7 U.S.C. § 13a-
1(d)(1 (A) (2012) and 17 C.F.R. § 143.8(a)(1) (2014), for the time period at issue in the case at
bar, the civil monetary penalty shall be not more than the greater of $140,000 for each violation
of the Act or triple the monetary gain to the Default Defendants. The CFTC has set forth several
factors to consider in assessing a civil monetary penalty. These factors include: the relationship
of the violation at issue to the regulatory purposes of the Act and whether or not the violations
involved core provisions of the Act; whether or not scienter was involved; the consequences
flowing from the violative conduct; financial benefits to a defendant; and harm to customers or
the market. Jn re Grossfeld, [1996-1998 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) 4 26,921
at 44,467-8 (CFTC Dec. 10, 1996), aff'd, 137 F.3d 1300 (11th Cir. 1998). Civil monetary
penalties should “reflect the abstract or general seriousness of each violation and should be
sufficiently high to deter future violations,” which means that civil monetary penalties should
make it financially detrimental to a defendant to fail to comply with the Act and Regulations so

that the defendant would rather comply than risk violations. Jd.

80. Conduct that violates the core provisions of the Act, such as customer fraud,
should be considered extremely serious. JCC, Inc., 63 F.3d at 1571. The CFTC itself has
recognized that:

[c]ustomer fraud is a violation of the core provisions of the [Act].

Such conduct historically has been considered to be among the

most serious of violations for purposes of initially determining the

severity of the sanctions to be imposed under the [Act] and

consistently has warranted substantial civil penalties.)
In re Slusser, CFTC No. 94-14, 1999 WL 507574 at *18 (CFTC July 19, 1999) (internal
quotations omitted). Severe sanctions are particularly warranted when a defendant repeatedly
violates the Act, id., and the CFTC may, as it did here, allege multiple violations in a single
count. Levy, 541 F.3d at 1110-11. Courts have routinely awarded significant civil monetary
penalties in cases involving fraud. See, e.g, Machado, 2012 WL 2994396 at *10-11 (S.D. Fla.
Apr. 20, 2012) (on default, ordering civil monetary penalty of $3,920,000 in fraud case based on
$140,000 for each of 28 customers defrauded); CFTC v. FX Professional Int’l Solutions, Inc.,
2010 WL 5541050 at *9-10 (S.D. Fla. Nov. 20, 2010) (on default, ordering civil monetary
penal:y of $4,080,000 based on 30 false statements issued by defendants); CFTC v. Cosmo, 2012
WL 5986525 at *3-4 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 1, 2012) (on default, ordering civil monetary penalty of
$240 million (triple the monetary gain to defendant) based on finding that defendant’s fraud
violations were intentional and significantly harmed numerous investors); CFTC vy. Int’]
Financial Servs., Inc., 2003 WL 22350941 at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Jun. 24, 2003) (on default, ordering
maxirnum allowable civil monetary penalty of $76 million equal to triple the monetary gain to
defendant for fraud violations).

81. This case warrants the imposition of a substantial civil monetary penalty against

the Default Defendants because they knowingly engaged in fraud, which is a core violation of

29
Case O:14-cv-62240-WPD Document 39 Entered on FLSD Docket O21/2015 Page 30 of 32

the Act. See Grossfeld, | 26,921 at 44,467 and n. 28 (citation omitted); see also United Investors
Group, Inc., 440 F. Supp. 2d 1345, 1361 (S.D. Fla. 2008) (determining that, among other things,
“the gravity of the offenses, the brazen and intentional nature of the violations, [and] the
vulnerability of the customers” justified “imposition of a substantial and meaningful [civil
monetary] penalty”). Specifically, Defendants knowingly engaged in an illegal scheme by, inter
alia, (i) misappropriating much of the pool participants’ funds, (ii) fraudulently soliciting
hundreds of thousands of dollars from participants for the purported purpose of trading forex,
and (iii) sending false account statements to these participants.

82. The Court believes that a civil monetary penalty in the total amount of
$3,026,116.23 against the Default Defendants, joint and several, is justified in this case. This
amount represents three times the monetary gain to Default Defendants as a result of their fraud.
The amount of the civil monetary penalty is appropriate given the repeated and egregious nature
of the: Default Defendants’ fraudulent scheme. See United Investors Group, Inc., 440 F. Supp.2d
at 1361. Accordingly, this Court orders the Default Defendants to pay, jointly and severally, a
civil monetary penalty in the amount of $3,026,1 16.23, plus post-judgment interest (the “CMP
Obligation’’), Post-judgment interest on this civil monetary penalty shall accrue beginning on the
date of entry of this Order and shall be calculated using the Treasury Bill rate prevailing on the
date of this Order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1961 (2012).

83. The Default Defendants shall pay this CMP Obligation by electronic funds
transfer, U.S. postal money order, certified check, bank cashier’s check, or bank money order. If
payment is to be made other than by electronic funds transfer, then the payment shall be made

payable to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and sent to the address below:

of this Order by personal service or otherwise.

85. Partial Satisfaction: Any acceptance by the CFTC or the Monitor of partial
payment of the Default Defendants’ Restitution and/or CMP Obligations shall not be deemed a
waiver of their obligation to make further payments pursuant to this Order, or a waiver of the

CFTC’s right to seek to compel payment of any remaining balance.
