DEFAULT JUDGMENT ORDER
I. Introduction
On September 6, 2012, the United States Commodity Futures Trading
Commission filed its Complaint for Permanent Injunction, Civil Monetary
Penalties, and Other Equitable Relief against Defendants Nikolai Simon Battoo
(Battoo), BC Capital Group $.A. (BC Panama), BC Capital Group International
Limited a/k/a BC Capital Group Limited a/k/a BC Capital Group Global (BC Hong
Kong), and BC Capital Group Holdings $.A. (BC Switzerland) (for convenience’s

sake, collectively referred to as Defendants!) for violations of certain anti-fraud

 

} The Complaint originally included BC Capital Management LLP (BC London) as a
Defendant. Later, however, the Commission moved to voluntarily dismiss BC London and
vacate the default order entered against it. Dkt. Nos. 292-294.

provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act (the Act), 7 U.S.C. §§ 1 et seg.? and the
Commission Regulations (Regulations) promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. §§ 1.1 et
seq. (2012). Dkt. No. 1.

Pursuant to Rule 55(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, this matter
now comes before the Court on the Commission’s Motions for Default Judgment and
for Restitution, Disgorgement and Civil Monetary Penalty, as amended, (collectively
called the “motions”) and Memoranda in Support of the motions against Defendants
after this Court’s previous Order of Default Judgment for their failure to answer or
otherwise respond to the Complaint. Dkt. Nos. 174-175, 209, 235-236, 458. This
Court has considered the entire record in this matter, including the Commission’s
Motions, Memoranda in Support of the Motions and the exhibits to them, and finds
that good cause exists for entry of the relief requested. Accordingly, the
Commission’s Motions are granted, as detailed below.

THE COURT HEREBY FINDS:

1. On September 6, 2012, the Commission filed a three-count Complaint
and an Emergency Ex Parte Motion and Memorandum in Support for Statutory
Restraining Order, Expedited Discovery, Preliminary Injunction, and Other
Equitable Relief (the SRO Motion) against Defendants, alleging violations of certain

anti-fraud provisions of the Act and Regulations. Dkt. Nos. 1, 9. After careful

 

2 All citations to Sections of the Act that have not been amended will read as follows:
“Section x of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § x (2006).” All citations to the Act as amended by the CRA,
but not by the Dodd-Frank Act, will read as follows: “Section x of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § x
(Supp. II 2009).” All sections of the Act that have been amended by the Dodd-Frank Act will
read as follows: “Section x of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § x. Gupp. V 2012).”

2
Case: 1:12-cv-07127 Document #: 496 Filed: 01/11/16 Page 3 of 32 PagelD #:16127

consideration, this Court granted the Commission’s SRO Motion and, among other
things, froze all assets under the possession or control of Defendants. Dkt. No. 15-1.

2. On September 21, 2012, the Commission filed its Motion for
Preliminary Injunction and for the Appointment of a Receiver (Preliminary
Injunction Motion). Dkt. Nos. 18-19. This Court granted the Preliminary Injunction
Motion, made findings of fact and conclusions of law, enjoined Defendants from
future violations of the Act and Regulations, and placed Defendants under the
temporary receivership of Robb Evans & Associates LLC (Receiver). Preliminary
Injunction, Dkt. No. 22.

3. Defendants were effectively served with the Summons and Complaint
on March 27, 2013. Dkt. No. 147. Therefore, Defendants’ answers were due no later
than April 17, 2018. Id. To date, none of the Defendants have filed answers or
otherwise responded to the Complaint. Accordingly, the Commission requested a
Clerk’s Entry of Default, which was entered on June 25, 2013. Dkt. Nos. 150, 166.

4, On August 1, 2013, the Commission filed its Motion for Default
Judgment and Memorandum in Support, seeking a finding of liability against
Defendants, but reserving the amount of monetary damages until the Receiver
completed its financial analysis. Dkt. Nos. 174-175. This Court granted the
Commission’s Motion for Default Judgment on August 5, 2013, and extended the
Preliminary Injunction. Dkt. No. 209.

5. On December 4, 2013, the Receiver filed its Modified Report of

Receiver’s Activities January 18, 2013 Through November 22, 2013 (Modified

 
Case: 1:12-cv-07127 Document #: 496 Filed: 01/11/16 Page 4 of 32 PagelD #:16128

Report), which among other things, sets forth the financial analysis of the
Defendants’ fraudulent conduct. Dkt. No. 217.

6. On January 10, 2014, the Commission submitted its Motion for
Restitution, Disgorgement, and Civil Monetary Penalty, which was based on the
Receiver’s analysis at that time. Dkt. Nos. 235-236.

7. On October 15, 2015, in light of additional documents obtained by the
Receiver, the Commission filed an Amendment to its Motion for Restitution,
Disgorgement, and Civil Monetary Penalty (Amendment). Dkt. No. 458.

Il. Findings of Fact

8. In view of the default, the allegations of the Complaint must be
accepted as true; these findings bind the named Defendants. This Order is
supported by the following facts:

A. Parties

9. United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an
independent federal regulatory agency that is charged by Congress with the
administration and enforcement of the Act and the Regulations promulgated
thereunder. The Commission maintains its principal office at Three Lafayette
Centre, 1155 21st Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20581.

10. Nikolai Simon Battoo is an individual who is believed to reside in
Switzerland. Until around 2007, Battoo was a resident of Florida. Until April 2018,
Battoo was a principal of a Commission-registered commodity pool operator (CPO)

and commodity trading advisor (CTA) located in Lincoln, Nebraska.
Case: 1:12-cv-07127 Document #: 496 Filed: 01/11/16 Page 5 of 32 PagelD #:16129

11. BC Capital Group S.A. is incorporated under the laws of the
Republic of Panama. BC Panama has never been registered in any capacity with the
Commission.

12. BC Capital Group Limited is incorporated under the laws of Hong
Kong. BC Hong Kong has never been registered in any capacity with the
Commission.

13. BC Capital Group Holdings S.A. is incorporated under the laws of
Switzerland. BC Switzerland has never been registered in any capacity with the
Commission.

B. Structure of the BC Common Enterprise

14. Battoo controlled BC Panama, BC Hong Kong, and BC Switzerland
and operated them as a common enterprise (the BC Common Enterprise) in
connection with the Private International Wealth Management (PIWM) and Private
International Wealth Management—Insurance (PIWM-J) portfolios (collectively, the
PIWM Portfolios). Although each entity purportedly performed different functions
in operating the PIWM Portfolios, Defendants did not differentiate between the
various corporations in solicitation materials or in communications with United
States residents and others (pool participants). Instead, some corporations were
mere shells with no actual offices. All actual operations of the BC Common
Enterprise occurred at Battoo’s office in London and his home office in Switzerland.

15. BC Panama purports to be the “manager and managing company” of

the PIWM Portfolios. Battoo is identified as the contact person for BC Panama in

 
Case: 1:12-cv-07127 Document #: 496 Filed: 01/11/16 Page 6 of 32 PagelD #:16130

the 2009 due diligence questionnaire (DDQ) that Defendants prepared and provided
to pool participants.

16. BC Hong Kong purports to be the “appointed financial investment
advisor” to BC Panama. BC Panama and BC Hong Kong are “responsible for the
customization and implementation (investment management) of the custom tailored
PIWM portfolio strategies for each mandate.” Battoo is identified as the principal of
and contact for BC Hong Kong in the 2009 DDQ.

17. BC Panama and BC Hong Kong are both shell companies. Battoo
subleased a section of office space from Alliance Investment Management (Alliance),
a Bahamas registered broker-dealer, to use as BC Panama’s and BC Hong Kong’s
“office.” Battoo and other employees, agents, and principals of the BC Common
Enterprise would occasionally use Alliance’s office for meetings with pool
participants and investment advisors. But no employee, agent, or principal of the
BC Common Enterprise operated from Alliance’s offices on a full-time basis.
Instead, Alliance staff would receive mail and forward it unopened to Battoo. BC
Panama and BC Hong Kong shared telephone and facsimile numbers with Alliance.

18. BC Switzerland is an affiliated company to BC Hong Kong and
purports to provide research and development, along with trading and execution,
under contract to BC Hong Kong. Battoo works from BC Switzerland’s office, which
is believed to be located in Battoo’s residence. Battoo used BC Switzerland’s office to
call investment advisors in the United States about the status of redemption

requests made by U.S. pool participants. Battoo is identified as the only contact
Case: 1:12-cv-07127 Document #: 496 Filed: 01/11/16 Page 7 of 32 PagelD #:16131
person for BC Switzerland. The telephone number for BC Switzerland provided in
the 2009 DD@Q is the same as for Alliance, BC Panama, and BC Hong Kong.

19. Solicitation materials that Defendants provided to prospective pool
participants do not distinguish between the different entities comprising the BC
Common Enterprise. For example, the DDQ identifies “BC Capital Group” as the
PIWM Portfolios’ “Global Overseer” and lists offices in the Bahamas, Hong Kong,
London, Panama, Singapore, and Switzerland. According to organizational charts,
all entities comprising the BC Common Enterprise share the same “Professional
Executive Board” and “Investment Advisory Board,” with Battoo as Senior Advisor
to the Investment Advisory Board. Battoo did not identify on behalf of which entity
comprising the BC Common Enterprise he was acting when communicating with
pool participants. Instead, account statements and letters to pool participants were
written on “PIWM” and “PIWM-I” letterhead.

C. Summary of the Fraud Scheme

20. From at least January 2003 to the present, the BC Common
Enterprise, by and through its agents, employees and principals including but not
limited to Battoo, and Battoo directly, solicited pool participants to invest in the
PIWM Portfolios. Solicitation materials provided by Defendants to prospective pool
participants state that the PIWM Portfolios would engage in the trading of
commodities, futures contracts, and equities, along with other investment
strategies. Based on these solicitations, at least 250 U.S. pool participants invested

at least $140 million into the PIWM Portfolios.

 
Case: 1:12-cv-07127 Document #: 496 Filed: 01/11/16 Page 8 of 32 PagelD #:16132

21. In 2008, investments made by the PIWM Portfolios into various funds
of which Battoo acted as investment advisor suffered significant losses. However,
Defendants failed to disclose some losses, while affirmatively misleading pool
participants about the extent of other losses. Defendants made further
misrepresentations to pool participants between 2009 and 2011 about the value of
the PIWM Portfolios’ underlying investments and the location of the pools’ funds.

D. Defendants’ Solicitation of Pool Participants

22. The BC Common Enterprise, while acting as a CPO, and Battoo, while
acting as an Associated Person (AP) of a CPO, solicited pool participants, both
directly and by soliciting U.S.-based investment advisors to recommend
investments by their clients, at offshore conferences hosted by investment advisors
between at least 2006 and 2010. Battoo, along with other agents or employees of the
BC Common Enterprise, gave presentations at the conferences about the PIWM
Portfolios. Defendants provided prospective pool participants with copies of the
DDQs and Power Point presentations describing the investment strategies used for
the PIWM Portfolios. Defendants also provided prospective pool participants with
one-page documents on PIWM letterhead that show the purported monthly returns
of the PIWM Portfolios since at least 2001, along with information on the
underlying investments held by the portfolios (the Tear Sheets).

23. Defendants told prospective pool participants that a portion of the
PIWM Portfolios would be used for futures trading. The DDQs identify “Financial

Futures” and “Commodities” as part of the “Underlying Investments” made by the
Case: 1:12-cv-07127 Document #: 496 Filed: 01/11/16 Page 9 of 32 PagelD #:16133

PIWM Portfolios. Moreover, Tear Sheets given to pool participants indicated that a
portion of the PIWM Portfolios is invested in “Multi-Strategy Futures &
Commodities.” The DDQs represent that Battoo is the registered principal of a CTA
registered with the National Futures Association (NFA) in the United States. The
DDQs also state that BC Hong Kong is affihated with a registered CTA located in
Singapore. The Power Point presentations tout that Battoo is an “accomplished
financial trader” with over fifteen years’ experience specializing in the futures and
commodities markets.

24, Since at least January 2008, pool participants sent funds, directly or
through offshore companies with the intent of investing in the PIWM Portfolios, to
an account in the name of BC Panama at Alliance. Alliance told at least some pool
participants that pool participants shared all profits or losses of the PIWM Portfolio
in which they invested on a pro rata basis. Defendants established at least eleven
PIWM Portfolios in which U.S. pool participants invested funds (the “U.S.
Participant Pools”).

25. Defendants told pool participants that the PIWM Portfolios contained
$1.5 billion as of May 2012, down from $2.2 billion in March 2009. Defendants also
told pool participants that there were sixty-eight separate PIWM Portfolios as of

March 2009.

E. Defendants’ Investments and Trading on Behalf of the PIWM
Portfolios

26. The PIWM Portfolios functioned as a fund of funds, whereby

Defendants invested pool participant funds into a variety of other hedge funds.

 
Case: 1:12-cv-07127 Document #: 496 Filed: 01/11/16 Page 10 of 32 PagelD #:16134

Defendants told pool participants that the PIWM Portfolios would pursue several
different strategies to generate returns, including strategies involving futures
trading. Although each PIWM Portfolio held slightly different combinations of
funds, the underlying investments of each portfolio fall into three general
categories: (a) hedge funds for which Battoo acted as investment advisor; (b) hedge
funds and commodity pools operated by third parties; and (c) “Managed Accounts.”

27. Defendants told pool participants that a portion of the PIWM Portfolios
was invested with five hedge funds for which Battoo acted as investment advisor:
(a) FuturesOne Diversified Fund (F1 Diversified); (b) FuturesOne Innovative Fund
(F1 Innovative); (c) Anchor Hedge Fund (Anchor Fund); (d) Galaxy Fund; and (e)
Two Oceans Fund (collectively, the Battoo-Operated Funds). Each Battoo-Operated
Fund contained multiple “share classes” in which the PIWM Portfolios invested.
Several share classes of F1 Diversified held trading accounts at futures commission
merchants (FCMs) in the United States and actively traded futures and options on
futures contracts on U.S. exchanges.

28. Defendants told pool participants that a portion of the PIWM Portfolios
was also invested in various hedge funds operated by entities unaffiliated with
Battoo. These investments included some of the largest global hedge funds, as well
as commodity pools run by at least four third-party CPOs. At least three of these
third-party CPOs are located in the United States.

29. Finally, Defendants told pool participants that Defendants traded a

portion of the PIWM Portfolios in six “Managed Accounts” held at Alliance. One

10
Case: 1:12-cv-07127 Document #: 496 Filed: 01/11/16 Page 11 of 32 PagelD #:16135

“Managed Account” was termed “Multi-Strategy Futures & Commodities.”
Defendants told pool participants in the U.S. Participant Pools that up to 18.79% of
their portfolios’ funds were in the “Multi-Strategy Futures & Commodities”
managed account.
F. Defendants’ Undisclosed Losses and Misrepresentations in 2008

The 2008 Trading Losses and Failure to Disclose: October to December 2008

30. Between April 2008 and October 2008, the PIWM Portfolios suffered
significant losses, potentially as high as $140 million that Defendants failed to
disclose to pool participants. As of December 31, 2008, the PIWM Portfolios held
significant investments in six share classes of the Anchor Fund, Galaxy Fund, and
F1 Diversified Fund (Phi R2 share classes). Between April 2008 and October 2008,
the Phi R2 share classes suffered significant losses from trading on a London-based
investment platform (the Phi R2 Fund losses). Because of the Phi R2 Fund losses,
the Anchor Fund, Galaxy Fund, and F1 Diversified Fund suspended redemptions of
the Phi R2 share classes between October 13, 2008 and December 18, 2008.

31. Battoo, as investment advisor to the Anchor Fund, Galaxy Fund, and
F1 Diversified Fund, knew or was reckless in not knowing of the Phi R2 Fund losses
and the resulting suspensions of redemptions. Despite this knowledge, Defendants
did not inform some PIWM Portfolio pool participants that a significant portion of
their portfolios were negatively impacted by the Phi R2 Fund losses and the

resulting suspensions of redemptions. Defendants accepted additional funds from

11

 
Case: 1:12-cv-07127 Document #: 496 Filed: 01/11/16 Page 12 of 32 PagelD #:16136

existing pool participants after the PIWM Portfolios suffered the Phi R2 Fund losses
without disclosing the losses to pool participants.
The Madoff-Related Losses and Misrepresentations: December 2008

32. Defendants made misrepresentations to pool participants about the
PIWM Portfolios’ exposure to the Ponzi scheme operated by Bernard Madoff (the
Madoff scheme).

33. Tear Sheets that Defendants provided to pool participants during sales
solicitations indicate that, as of October 2008, between 7% and 20% of each PIWM
Portfolio was invested in certain share classes of the Anchor Fund and Galaxy Fund
(Madoff share classes). Unknown to pool participants, the Madoff share classes
ultimately invested in the Madoff scheme.

34. Between December 18, 2008 and December 22, 2008, after the Madoff
scheme was exposed and Madoff was arrested, the Anchor Fund and Galaxy Fund
suspended redemptions of the Madoff share classes because of losses sustained in
the Madoff scheme.

35. As the investment manager of the Anchor Fund and Galaxy Fund,
Battoo knew or was reckless in not knowing of the funds’ suspensions of
redemptions.

36. Despite knowing about the PIWM Portfolios’ substantial exposure to
the Madoff scheme, on or about December 16, 2008, Battoo sent an email to two

investment advisors advising U.S. pool participants stating that “PIWM-Insurance

12
Case: 1:12-cv-07127 Document #: 496 Filed: 01/11/16 Page 13 of 32 PagelD #:16137

will be issuing a letter by end of week to all clients to inform them that the current
Madoff situation will have practically no impact to its portfolios.”

37. On or about December 19, 2008, an agent of the BC Common
Hnterprise operating from Florida sent an email to some U.S. pool participants and
attached a letter from Battoo, dated December 19, 2008. Battoo’s letter states that:

PIWM did carry a small nominal percentage of approx (0.20% - 2.9%)

portion of indirect exposure through a diversified hedge fund. Thus

when accounted for, the impact will be less than (0.05% - 0.78%)

depending on each client’s custom-tailored portfolio which is very low

and well under 1.0%.

38. Battoo’s December 19, 2008 letter misrepresents the PIWM Portfolio
pool participants’ exposure to the Madoff scheme.

39. Defendants also failed to disclose losses associated with the Madoff
scheme when Battoo discussed the PIWM Portfolios’ performance at a conference
for PIWM Portfolio pool participants held in Las Vegas, Nevada, in January 2009.
Defendants accepted additional funds from existing pool participants after the
PIWM Portfolios suffered the Madoff scheme losses without disclosing such losses to

pool participants.

G. Defendants Made Misrepresentations Regarding the Value of
Underlying Investments and Location of Funds

40. Following the undisclosed losses suffered by the PIWM Portfolios in
2008 due to the Phi R2 Fund and the Madoff scheme losses, Defendants made
additional misrepresentations to pool participants about the value of the underlying
investments in the PIWM Portfolios and the location of the PIWM Portfolios’ assets.

These misrepresentations began as some pool participants were placing additional

13

 
Case: 1:12-cv-07127 Document #: 496 Filed: 01/11/16 Page 14 of 32 PagelD #:16138

funds in the PIWM Portfolios and continued as pool participants demanded
redemptions starting in 2011.

The Fraudulent Asset Verifications: September 2009

41. In or around September 2009, Defendants provided pool participants
in the eleven U.S. Participant Pools with asset verifications conducted by the PIWM
Portfolios’ third-party administrator (Asset Verifications). These eleven Asset
Verifications purportedly provide the value of investments made by the PIWM
Portfolios as of December 31, 2008. While the Asset Verifications were issued by the
third-party administrator, they were based on information provided to the third-
party administrator by Defendants. Further, Battoo, not the third-party
administrator, sent the Asset Verifications to some if not all pool participants via
email.

42. The Asset Verifications grossly overstate the net asset value of the
U.S. Participant Pools’ investments with commodity pools operated by four third-
party CPOs. The Asset Verifications state that the U.S. Participant Pools had
investments worth over $21.8 million with commodity pools operated by these four
third-party CPOs. However, the total value of all investments with these third-
party CPOs made by any entity associated with Defendants totaled less than $8
million. Further, the Asset Verifications backdate investments in funds operated by
two CPOs that occurred after the purported valuation date. At a minimum, the
Asset Verifications overstate investments with the four third-party CPOs by $13.9

million.

14
Case: 1:12-cv-07127 Document #; 496 Filed: 01/11/16 Page 15 of 32 PagelD #:16139

Misrepresentations Regarding Funds Held at MF Global

43. Beginning in October 2011, Battoo made representations to pool
participants that the PIWM Portfolios were significantly impacted by the collapse of
MF Global Inc. (MF Global), a registered FCM that filed for bankruptcy at the end
of October 2011. Citing the MF Global collapse, Defendants suspended valuations
and redemptions of PIWM Portfolios on November 11, 2011. In letters sent to pool
participants on or about November 11, 2011, Battoo told pool participants that a
portion of the PIWM Portfolios’ assets were held in “underlying managed accounts
at MF Global, along with CTAs and hedge fund investments that cleared through
MF Global.” Defendants told pool participants that all PIWM Portfolios were
affected. In a later letter sent to pool participants via email on or about December 9,
2011, Battoo states that, while “each portfolio would have a varying exposure to MF
Global|,]” the exposure ranged from 17% to 39% of each portfolio.

44. According to the most recent account statements that Defendants
provided to pool participants, the U.S. Participant Pools have a value of at least
$130 million. Therefore, at a minimum, the U.S. Participant Pools’ exposure to MF
Global should be at least $22 million, or 17% of $130 million.

45. Despite Battoo’s statements to pool participants, MF Global had no
“managed accounts” in the name of PIWM or the PIWM Portfolios. In fact, the only
accounts with any connection to Defendants were in the name of the F1 Diversified
Fund and held less than $2.7 million in net liquidation value at the time of MF

Global’s bankruptcy.

15

 
Case: 1:12-cv-07127 Document #: 496 Filed: 01/11/16 Page 16 of 32 PagelD #:16140

46. Given the relatively small exposure that the PIWM Portfolios had to
the MF Global collapse, Defendants misrepresented to pool participants either (a)
the value of the PIWM Portfolios or (b) the extent to which the PIWM Portfolios
were affected by the MF Global collapse.

Ill. Conclusions of Law
A. Jurisdiction & Venue

47. This Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendants and subject
matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 18a-
1 (2012), which authorizes the Commission to seek injunctive relief against any
person whenever it appears that such person has engaged, is engaging, or is about
to engage in any act or practice constituting a violation of any provision of the Act
or any rule, Regulation, or order thereunder.

48. \ Venue properly lies with this Court under Section 6c(e) of the Act, 7
U.S.C. §13a-1(¢) (2012), in that Defendants transacted business in this District, and
that the acts and practices in violation of the Act and the Regulations have occurred
within this district, among other places.

B. Defendants’ Failure to Answer Warrants Entry of Default Judgment

49. “When a party against whom a judgment for affirmative relief is
sought has failed to plead or otherwise defend ... the clerk must enter the party’s
default.” FED. R. Civ. P. 55(a). As indicated supra, Defendants were properly served
on March 27, 2018, and thus were required to answer or otherwise respond to the

Complaint on or before on April 17, 2013. Dkt. No. 147. Defendants failed to answer

16
Case: 1:12-cv-07127 Document #: 496 Filed: 01/11/16 Page 17 of 32 PagelD #:16141

or otherwise respond to the Complaint in the time permitted by the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure. Accordingly, the Commission requested a Clerk’s Entry of Default,
which was entered on June 25, 2013. Dkt. Nos. 150, 155.

50. Once the Clerk has entered a default, the party seeking the default is
then required to apply to the court for a default judgment. See FED. R. Civ. P.
55(b)(2). Entry of default judgment is left to the sound discretion of the district
court. See Dundee Cement Co. v. Howard Pipe & Concrete Prods., Inc., 722 F.2d
1319, 1822 (7th Cir. 1983); see also C.K.S. Engrs, Inc. v. White Mountain Gypsum
Co., 726 F.2d 1202, 1206 (7th Cir. 1984) (noting although the law favors trial on the
merits, these considerations must be balanced against the need to promote efficient
litigation and to protect the interests of all litigants). Defendants’ failure to answer
or otherwise respond to the Complaint merits entry of this Order. The interests of
those who will make claims for restitution will be protected in the claims-
verification process; the fact-findings in this Order bind the named Defendants.

C. Defendants Violated Certain Anti-Fraud Provisions of the Act and
Regulations

51. “Upon default, the well-pled allegations of the complaint relating to
liability are taken as true, but those relating to the amount of damages suffered
ordinarily are not.” Wehrs v. Wells, 688 F.3d 886, 892 (7th Cir. 2012) (citing United
States v. Di Mucci, 879 F.2d 1488, 1497 (7th Cir.1989); FED. R. Civ. P. 8(b)(6) (“An
allegation—other than one relating to the amount of damages—is admitted if a
responsive pleading is required and the allegation is not denied.”). “A default

judgment establishes, as a matter of law, that defendants are liable to plaintiff on

17

 
Case: 1:12-cv-07127 Document #: 496 Filed: 01/11/16 Page 18 of 32 PagelD #:16142

each cause of action alleged in the complaint.” Wehrs, 688 F.3d at 892 (quoting e360
Insight v. The Spamhaus Project, 500 F.3d 594, 602 (7th Cir. 2007)). Accordingly,
the Court finds Defendants liable for each violation of the Act and Regulations

alleged in the Complaint.

Defendants Violated Sections 4b(a)(1)(A)-(C), 7 U.S.C. §§ 6b(a)(1)(A)-(C)
(Supp. V 2012)

52. Sections 4b(a)(1)(A)-(C) of the Act make it unlawful

for any person, in or in connection with any order to make, or the
making of, any contract of sale of any commodity in interstate
commerce or for future delivery that is made, or to be made, on or
subject to the rules of a designated contract market, for or on behalf of
any other person — (A) to cheat or defraud or attempt to cheat or
defraud the other person; (B) willfully to make or cause to be made to
the other person any false report or statement or willfully to enter or
cause to be entered for the other person any false record; [or] (C)
willfully to deceive or attempt to deceive the other person by any
means whatsoever in regard to any order or contract or the disposition
or execution of any order or contract, in regard to any act of agency
performed, with respect to any order or contract for or, in the case of
paragraph 2, with the other person.

7 U.S.C. §§ 6b(a)(1)(A)-(C) (Supp. V 2012).

538. As set forth above, Defendants violated Sections 4b(a)(1)(A)-(C) of the
Act, 7 U.S.C. §§ 6b(a)(1)(A)-(C) (Supp. V 2012), by knowingly or recklessly making
material misrepresentations and omissions to pool participants regarding (1) the
PIWM Portfolios’ exposure to the Phi R2 losses and the Madoff scheme, (2) the
value and location of assets purportedly held by the PIWM Portfolios, and (8) the
PIWM Portfolios’ exposure to the MF Global bankruptcy.

Defendants Violated Section 4o(1), 7 U.S.C. § 6o0(1) (2006)

18
Case: 1:12-cv-07127 Document #: 496 Filed: 01/11/16 Page 19 of 32 PagelD #:16143

54. Section 40(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 6o(1) (2006), prohibits fraudulent
transactions by CPOs and APs of CPOs. Section 4o0(1)(A) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
60(1)(A) (2006), makes it unlawful for a CPO, or an AP of a CPO, to employ any
device, scheme or artifice to defraud any participant or prospective participant by
use of instrumentalities of interstate commerce. Section 40(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
60(1)(B) (2006), makes it unlawful for a CPO, or an AP of a CPO, to engage in any
transaction, practice or course of business that operates as a fraud or deceit upon
any participant or prospective participant by use of instrumentalities of interstate
commerce.

55. As set.forth above, Defendants violated Section 40(1) of the Act, 7
U.S.C. 6o(1) (2006), by knowingly or recklessly making material misrepresentations
and omissions to pool participants regarding (1) the PIWM Portfolios’ exposure to
the Phi R2 losses and the Madoff scheme, (2) the value and location of assets
purportedly held by the PIWM Portfolios, and (3) the PIWM Portfolios’ exposure to
the MF Global bankruptcy.

Defendants Violated Section 4c(b), 7 U.S.C. 6c(b) (2006) and Regulations
33.10(a)-(c), 17 CER. §§ 38.10(a)-(c) (2012)

56. Section 4c(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 6c(b) (2006), provides that “[n]Jo
person shall... enter into or confirm the execution of any transaction involving any
.. option... contrary to any... regulation of the Commission.” In turn,
Regulations 33.10(a)-(c), 17 C.F.R. §§ 33.10(a)-(c) (2012), provide that:
It shall be unlawful for any person directly or indirectly — (a) To cheat

or defraud or attempt to cheat or defraud any other person; (b) To
make or cause to be made to any other person any false report or

19

 
Case: 1:12-cv-07127 Document #: 496 Filed: 01/11/16 Page 20 of 32 PagelD #:16144

record thereof or cause to be entered for any person any false record

thereof; (c) To deceive or attempt to deceive any other person by any

means whatsoever [,] in or connection with an offer to enter into, the

entry into, the confirmation of the execution of, or the maintenance of,

any commodity option transaction.

57. As set forth above, Defendants violated Sections 4c(b) of the Act, 7
U.S.C. § 6c(b), and Regulations 33.10(a)-(c), 17 C.F.R. §§ 33.10(a)-(c) (2012), by
knowingly or recklessly making material misrepresentations and omissions to pool
participants regarding (1) the PIWM Portfolios’ exposure to the Phi R2 losses and
the Madoff scheme, (2) the value and location of assets purportedly held by the
PIWM Portfolios, and (8) the PIWM Portfolios’ exposure to the MF Global
bankruptcy.

Battoo ts Liable for the Violations of the Act and Regulations Committed by

BC Panama, BC Hong Kong, and BC Switzerland, as a Control Person

Pursuant to Section 13(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 18c(b) (2006)

58. Section 18(b) of the Act defines a controlling person “[a]ny person who,
directly or indirectly, controls any person who has violated any provision of the Act
lif that controlling person] did not act in good faith or knowingly induced, directly or
indirectly, the act or acts constituting the violation.” 7 U.S.C. § 18c(b) (2006). This
provision includes individuals, associations, partnerships, corporations and trusts
that exercise control over persons who violate the Act and fail to act in good faith.
See Monieson v. CFTC, 996 F.2d 852, 859-60 (7th Cir. 1998) (finding control person
liability when defendant made management and hiring decisions and oversaw the

day-to-day operations). Indeed, “[a] fundamental purpose of section 13(b) is to allow

the Commission to reach behind the corporate entity to the controlling individuals

20
Case: 1:12-cv-07127 Document #: 496 Filed: 01/11/16 Page 21 of 32 PagelD #:16145

of the corporation and to impose liability for violations of the Act directly on such
individuals as well as on the corporation itself.” JCC, Inc. v. CFTC, 63 F.3d 1557,
1567 (11th Cir. 1995) (quoting In re Apache Trading Corp., [1990-1992 Transfer
Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) § 25,251 at 38,794 (CFTC Mar. 11, 1992)

59. A controlling person acts in bad faith if he “did not maintain a
reasonably adequate system of internal supervision and control over the [employee]
or did not enforce with any reasonable diligence such system.” Harrison v. Dean
Witter Reynolds, Inc., 974 F.2d 878, 881 (7th Cir. 1992) (citations omitted). At a
minimum, the controlling person must act recklessly; negligence alone is
insufficient to support liability. See G.A. Thompson & Co., Inc. v. Partridge, 636
F.2d 945, 959-60 (5th Cir. 1981) (holding that recklessness is sufficient to establish
liability for a controlling person where he was involved in day-to-day operations and
could influence corporate policy). See also Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U.S.
185, 209 n.28 (1976) (noting that the controlling person provision of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1984 requires more than negligence).

60. To establish the “knowing inducement” element, the Commission must
show that “the controlling person had actual or constructive knowledge of the core
activities that constitute the violation at issue and allowed them to continue.” JCC,
Inc., 63 F.3d at 1568. Controlling persons cannot avoid liability by deliberately or
recklessly avoiding knowledge about potential wrongdoing. See United States v.
Ramsey, 785 F.2d 184, 188-89 (7th Cir. 1986) (allowing an “ostrich” jury instruction

because “actual knowledge and deliberate avoidance of knowledge are the same

21

 
Case: 1:12-cv-07127 Document #: 496 Filed: 01/11/16 Page 22 of 32 PagelD #:16146

thing”). To support a finding of constructive knowledge, the Commission must show
that a defendant “lack[ed] actual knowledge only because [he] consciously avoided
it.” JCC, Inc., 63 F.3d, at 1568 (citations omitted).

61. Battoo is a “controlling person” of the BC Common Enterprise. First,
Battoo has the requisite control over each of the entities that comprise the BC
Common Enterprise. As discussed above, Battoo is the “Senior Advisor” to the
“Investment Advisory Board” of the BC Common Enterprise. Battoo hires and
manages employees of the BC Common Enterprise. Second, Battoo had knowledge
of and participated in the fraudulent activity committed by the BC Common
Enterprise discussed above. In particular, Battoo made presentations at conferences
and sent communications to pool participants containing misrepresentations about
the PIWM Portfolios’ exposure to the Madoff schemes and to MF Global’s
bankruptcy. These presentations and communications show that Battoo knowingly
induced the BC Common Enterprise in its violations of the Act and the Regulations.
Therefore, Battoo is hable for the acts of BC Panama, BC Hong Kong, and BC
Switzerland.

BC Panama, BC Hong Kong, and BC Switzerland are Liable for Battoo’s

Violations of the Act and Regulations Pursuant to Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act,

7 ULS.C. § 2(a)(1)(B) (2006), and Regulation 1.2, 17 C_F.R. § 1.2 (2012)

62. Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 2(a)(1)(B) (2006), and
Regulation 1.2, 17 C.F.R. § 1.2 (2012), impose strict liability upon principals for the

actions of their agents acting within the scope of their employment. See Rosenthal &

Co. v. CFTC, 802 F.2d 963, 966 (7th Cir. 1986) (finding that principals are strictly

22
Case: 1:12-cv-07127 Document #: 496 Filed: 01/11/16 Page 23 of 32 PagelD #:16147

liable for the acts of their agents).? Battoo, as well as other employees and agents,
committed the acts and omissions described herein within the course and scope of
their employment with BC Panama, BC Hong Kong, and BC Switzerland.
Therefore, BC Panama, BC Hong Kong, and BC Switzerland are liable under
Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 2(a)(1)(B) (2006), and Regulation 1.2, 17
C.F.R. § 1.2 (2012), as a principal for its agents’ acts, omissions or failures as they
relate to violations of the Act and Regulations.

IV. Order for Permanent Injunction, Restitution, Disgorgement, A Civil
Monetary Penalty And Other Ancillary Relief

63. Section 6c(b) of the Act provides in pertinent part that “[u]pon a proper
showing, a permanent... injunction... shall be granted without bond.” 7 U.S.C. §
18a-1(b) (2006). Unlike private injunctive actions, which are rooted in the equity
jurisdiction of the federal courts, a Commission enforcement action seeking
injunctive relief is a creature of statute. See CP'TC v. Garofalo, No. 10-cv-2417, 2011
WL 4954082, at *5 (N.D. Ill. May 5, 2011) (citing CFTC v. Morgan, Harris & Scott
Lid., 484 F. Supp. 669, 676-77 (S.D.N.Y. 1979)). As a result, restrictive concepts
ordinarily associated with private injunctive actions, such as proof of irreparable
injury or inadequacy of other remedies, are inapplicable. See CFTC v. Hunt, 591

F.2d 1211, 1220 (7th Cir. 1979)); see also Garofalo, 2011 WL 4954082, at *5.

 

3 Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 2(a)(1)(B) (2006), states: “The act, omission,
or failure of any official, agent, or other person acting for any individual, association,
partnership, corporation, or trust within the scope of his employment or office shall be
deemed the act, omission, or failure of such individual, association, partnership,
corporation, or trust, as well as of such official, agent, or other person.”

23

 
Case: 1:12-cv-07127 Document #: 496 Filed: 01/11/16 Page 24 of 32 PagelD #:16148

In order to obtain a permanent injunction, the Commission must show that a
violation of the Act and/or Regulations occurred, and that there is some reasonable
likelihood of future violations. See Hunt, 591 F.2d at 1220; see also Garofalo, 2011
WL 4954082, at *6. Furthermore, “the commission of past illegal conduct is highly
suggestive of the likelihood of future violations.” Garofalo, 2011 WL 4954085, at *6
(quoting CFTC v. Crown Colony Commodity Options Ltd., 434 F. Supp. 911, 919
(S.D.N.Y.1977)).

64. In its Preliminary Injunction, this Court found that the Commission
made a prima facie showing that Defendants violated Sections 4b(a)(1)(A)-(C), 40,
and 4c(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. §§ 6b(a)(1)(A)-(C), 60, and 6c(b) (2006 and Supp. V
2012), and Regulations 33.10(a)-(c), 17 C.F.R. §§ 38.10(a)-(c) (2012), by making
material misrepresentations and omissions concerning, among other things, the
suspensions of redemption caused by the Phi R2 losses, the PIWM Portfolios’
exposure to the Madoff scheme, and the value and location of the PIWM Portfolios’
assets—with the knowledge that the statements were false. This Court has also
held that there is a reasonable likelihood of future violations by Defendants.

65. ‘The Commission has shown that Defendants have engaged, are
engaging, and are about to engage in acts and practices which violate Sections
4b(a)(1)(A)-(C), 40(1), and 4c(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. §§ 6b(a)(1)(A)-(C) and 6c(b) (2006
and Supp. V 2012), and Regulations 33.10(a)-(c), 17 C.F.R. §§ 33.10(a)-(c) (2012).
Notwithstanding their default, the Commission has made a prima facie showing

that the defendant has engaged, or is engaging, in illegal conduct and that, unless

24
Case: 1:12-cv-07127 Document #: 496 Filed: 01/11/16 Page 25 of 32 PagelD #:16149

restrained and enjomed by this Court, there is a reasonable likelihood that
Defendants will continue to engage in the acts and practices alleged in the
Complaint and in similar acts and practices in violation of the Act and the
Regulations. Therefore, a permanent injunction is warranted.

IT 1S HEREBY ORDERED THAT:

66. Defendants have violated Sections 4b(a)(1)(A)-(C), 40(1), and 4c(b) of
the Act, 7 U.S.C. §§ 6b(a)(1)(A)-(C), 60(1), and 6e(b) (2006 and Supp. V 2012), and
Regulations 33.10(a)-(c), 17 C.F.R. §§ 33.10(a)-(c) (2012). Therefore, judgment shall
be and hereby is entered in favor of the Commission and against Defendants as
follows:

A. Prohibition on Violations

67. Defendants, all persons and entities insofar as they are acting in the
capacity of agents, servants, employees, successors, assigns, or attorneys of
Defendants, and all persons and entities insofar as they are acting in concert or
- participation with Defendants who receive actual notice of this order by personal
service or otherwise, shall be permanently prohibited, enjoined and restrained from
directly or indirectly engaging in any conduct in violation of Sections 4b(a)(1)(A)-(C),
4o(1), and 4c(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. §§ 6b(a)(1)(A)-(C), 6o(1), and 6c(b) (2012), and
Regulations 33.10(a)-(c), 17 C.F.R. §§ 33.10(a)-(c) (2015).

B. Trading, Solicitation and Registration Prohibitions
68, Permanent trading, solicitation and registration bans are appropriate

when a defendant’s violation of the Act and/or Regulations poses a threat to the

25

 
Case: 1:12-cv-07127 Document #: 496 Filed: 01/11/16 Page 26 of 32 PagelD #:16150

integrity of the markets regulated by the Commission. See Monieson, 996 F.2d at
863 (finding a trading ban appropriate and noting the CFTC takes a broad view of
what threatens the integrity of the markets); see also In re Staryk, [2003-2004
Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) 4 29,826, at 56,452 (CFTC July 23,
2004) (explaining that a bar prohibiting a defendant is appropriate when the record
shows that a [defendant’s] misconduct represents an inherent threat to the integrity
of the futures markets in the public eye); In re Miller, [1994-1996 Transfer Binder]
CCH { 26,440, at 42,914 (CFTC June 16, 1995), remanded on other grounds, Miller
v. CFTC, 197. F.3d 1227 (9th Cir. 1999) (CFTC affirming with “no difficulty” the
trial court’s permanent trading ban because defendant's pattern of wrongdoing that
extended over several years posed a danger to the integrity of the market sufficient
to warrant a permanent ban).

69. Furthermore, in view of Defendants’ fraudulent conduct, there is no
basis for allowing them to participate in the commodities markets. See CFTC v.
Harrison, 2015 WL 13228387, at *1-2 (D.S.C. Mar. 23, 2015) GQmposing permanent
trading and registration bans in fraud case); see also Garofalo, 2011 WL 4954082
(same).

70. Therefore Defendants, all persons and entities insofar as they are
acting in the capacity of agents, servants, employees, successors, assigns, or
attorneys of Defendants, and all persons and entities insofar as they are acting in

concert or participation with Defendants who receive actual notice of this order by

26
Case: 1:12-cv-07127 Document #: 496 Filed: 01/11/16 Page 27 of 32 PagelD #:16151

personal service or otherwise, shall be permanently prohibited, enjoined and
restrained from directly or indirectly:

a. Trading on or subject to the rules of any registered entity (as
that term is defined in Section la of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. § la
(2012));

b. Entering into any transactions involving commodity futures,
options on commodity futures, commodity options (as that term
is defined in 17 C.F.R. § 1.3(hh) (2015)) (“commodity options”),
security futures products, foreign currency (as described in 7
U.S.C. §§ 2(c)(2)(B) and 2(c)(2)(C)G) (2012)) (forex contracts),
and/or “swaps” (as that term is defined in 7 U.S.C. § 1a(47)
(2012), and as further defined by 17 C.F.R. § 1.8(xxx) (2015)), for
their own personal account or for any account in which they
have a direct or indirect interest;

c. Having any commodity futures, options on commodity futures,
commodity options, security futures products, forex contracts,
and/or swaps traded on their behalf;

d. Controlling or directing the trading for or on behalf of any other
person or entity, whether by power of attorney or otherwise, in
any account involving commodity futures, options on commodity
futures, commodity options, security futures products, forex

contracts and/or swaps;

27

 
Case: 1:12-cv-07127 Document #: 496 Filed: 01/11/16 Page 28 of 32 PagelD #:16152

e. Soliciting, receiving or accepting any funds from any person for
the purpose of purchasing or selling any commodity futures,
options on commodity futures, commodity options, security
futures products, forex contracts, and/or swaps;

f. Applying for registration or claiming exemption from
registration with the Commission in any capacity, and engaging
in any activity requiring such registration or exemption from
registration with the Commission, except as provided for in 17
C.F.R. § 4.14(a)(9) (2015); and

g. Acting as a principal (as that term is defined in 17 C.F.R. §
3.1(a) (2015)), agent or any other officer or employee of any
person (as that term is defined in 7 U.S.C. § la (2012))
registered, exempted from registration or required to be
registered with the Commission except as provided for in 17
C.F.R. § 4.14(a)(9) (2015).

C. Restitution, Disgorgement, and Civil Monetary Penalty

Restitution and Disgorgement

71. The Court’s authority to order restitution is ancillary to the Court’s
authority to order injunctive relief under Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1
(Supp. V 2012). This authority is founded on the well-established legal principle
articulated by the Supreme Court in Porter v. Warner Holding Co.:

Unless otherwise provided by statute, all the inherent equitable
powers of the District Court are available for the proper and complete

28
Case: 1:12-cv-07127 Document #: 496 Filed: 01/11/16 Page 29 of 32 PagelD #:16153

exercise of that jurisdiction. And since the public interest 1s involved in

a proceeding of this nature, those equitable powers assume an even

‘broader power and more flexible character than when a private

controversy is at stake. Power is thereby resident in the District Court,

in exercising this jurisdiction, to do equity and to mould each decree to

the necessities of the particular case.

Porter, 328 U.S. 395, 398 (1946) Gnternal citations omitted); see also CFTC v.
Hunt, 591 F.2d 1211, 1222-28 (7th Cir. 1979).

72. The Supreme Court reaffirmed this principle in Mitchell v. Robert De
Mario Jewelry, Inc., 361 U.S. 288, 296 (1960), where it found that the district court
had jurisdiction to order an employer to reimburse employees for lost wages in a
suit by the Secretary of Labor to restrain violations of the Fair Labor Standards
Act. “[T]he comprehensiveness of [the court’s] equitable jurisdiction is not to be
denied or limited in the absence of a clear and valid legislative command. Unless a
statute in so many words, or by a necessary and inescapable reference, restricts the
court's jurisdiction in equity, the full scope of that jurisdiction is to be recognized
and applied.” Jd. at 291 (quoting Porter, 328 U.S. at 398). Therefore, Defendants
are liable for restitution in the amount of $294,246,741.68, to be paid in accordance
with a distribution plan approved by this Court. This amount represents the
amount of funds solicited by Defendants from pool participants ($460,246,767.13),
less any funds returned to pool participants ($166,000,025.50).

73. Following these principles, the Seventh Circuit has held that a district
court has the authority to order restitution, and may compel disgorgement of

illegally obtained profits pursuant to the Act. See CFTC v. Hunt, 591 F.2d 1211,

1223 (7th Cir. 1979); see also CFTC v. Sarvey, No. 08-C-192, 2012 WL 426746, at * 6

29

 
Case: 1:12-cv-07127 Document #: 496 Filed: 01/11/16 Page 30 of 32 PagelD #:16154

(N.D. Ill. Feb. 10, 2012). Furthermore, the Seventh Circuit has held that it would
frustrate the spirit of the regulatory scheme to allow a violator to retain the profits
from his violations. See Hunt, 591 F.2d at 1228 (citing SEC v. Texas Gulf Sulphur
Co., 446 F.2d 1801, 1808 (2d Cir. 1971) and SEC v. Manor Nursing Centers, Inc.,
458 F.2d 1082, 1104 (2d Cir. 1972)). There is no basis to permit Defendants to
benefit from their fraudulent conduct. Therefore they must disgorge their ill-gotten
. gains in the amount of $49 million.

Civil Monetary Penalty

74. — Section 6c(d)(1) of the Act provides that “the Commission may seek and
the Court shall have jurisdiction to impose ... on any person found in the action to
have committed any violation, a civil penalty in the amount of not more than the
higher of $100,000 or triple the monetary gain to the person for each violation.” 7
U.S.C. §18a-1(d)(1) (2006). The Regulations adjust the statutory civil monetary
penalty of $100,000 for inflation. See 17 C.F.R. § 148.8. For the period at issue, the
statutory civil monetary penalty was $130,000 per violation (for violations
committed prior to October 23, 2008) and $140,000 per violation (for violations
committed thereafter). Jd. By not responding to the CFTC’s complaint, Defendants
offer no justification why the Court should not impose a civil monetary penalty of
treble the Defendants’ gain. Treble damages is a common multiplier of damages
when imposing a penalty; enough to punish a serious past violation and enough to

deter future violations, but no so much as to amount to an unreasonable

30
Case: 1:12-cv-07127 Document #: 496 Filed: 01/11/16 Page 31 of 32 PagelD #:16155

punishment. Here, treble damages would be $49,000,000 times three, specifically,
$147,000,000.
VI. Miscellaneous Provisions

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED THAT:

75. The Court determines that the continued appointment of the Receiver,
Robb Evans & Associates LLC, is warranted. The Receivership shall continue until
such time as the Court dissolves it, upon motion of the Receiver or the Commission.

76. The Receiver is hereby instructed to liquidate assets under the control
of the Receivership, including but not limited to assets under the control of Battoo,
and to liquidate such assets in such a way as he reasonably believes will maximize
their value. The Receiver is instructed to maintain the proceeds of such assets for
purposes of providing restitution to Defendants’ victims in a manner to be
determined by this Court at a future date.

77. Copies of this Order may be served by any means, including facsimile
transmission, email, United Parcel Service and Federal Express, upon Defendants
or any other entity or person that may be subject to any provision of this Order.
Amanda Burks, Andrew Ridenour, Kathleen Banar, Rick Glaser, and Erica Bodin,
all employees of the Commission, are hereby specially appointed to serve process,
including this Order and all other papers in this cause.

78. All pleadings, correspondence, notices or other materials required by

this Order shall be sent to Amanda Burks, Trial Attorney, Division of Enforcement,
