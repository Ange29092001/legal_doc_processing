COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF AND
FOR CIVIL MONETARY PENALTIES UNDER THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC” or “Commission’’), an

independent federal agency, by and through its attorneys, hereby alleges as follows:

I SUMMARY

1. From at least January 2016 and continuing through the present (the “Relevant
Period”), William Thomas Caniff (““Caniff’), Arie Bos (“Bos”), Berkley Capital Management,
LLC (““BCM”’), BBOT 1, LP (““BBOT’’) and Berkley II, LP (“Berkley IT’) (collectively,
Defendants’), have engaged in a scheme whereby they fraudulently solicited and accepted at
least $4.8 million from at least 62 commodity pool participants for the purpose of trading binary
options on or subject to the rules of a designated contract market in pool accounts to be managed

by BCM.

2. In January 2016, Caniff and Bos formed BCM and began to offer individual
participants the opportunity to trade binary options with pools of other participants, first through
the BBOT pool and later through the Berkley II pool. Caniff used a small portion of
participants’ funds to trade binary options through an account he set up at the binary options
trading firm, the North American Derivatives Exchange, Inc. (“NADEX’’), which is a designated
contract market headquartered in Chicago, Illinois. Caniff sent Bos fabricated statements
reflecting incredible results of his trading for these pools. In turn, Bos ignored numerous red
flags and recklessly accepted Caniff’s reports of profitable trading without verifying the results
in any way and used them to both solicit participants with claims of past profitable trading and
generate false statements that he sent to participants showing grossly-inflated, non-existent,
profits for their accounts.

3. Caniff misappropriated a substantial portion of the participants’ funds, paying Bos
and himself between $1.1 million to $1.2 million each as “fees based on non-existent profits.
Caniff also misappropriated funds to pay some participants a total of $2.3 million in a manner
akin to a Ponzi scheme. Overall, the defrauded participants have experienced a shortfall of
approximately $2.5 million.

4. By virtue of this conduct and the conduct further described below, Defendants
have engaged, are engaging in, or are about to engage in acts and practices that violate the
following sections of the Commodity Exchange Act (“Act” or “CEA”’), 7 U.S.C. 8§ 1-26 (2012),
and Commission Regulations (“Regulations”) promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. pts. 1-190
(2018), specifically Section 4c(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.§ 6c(b) (2012), and Regulation 32.4,

17 C.F.R. § 32.14 (2018), which prohibit fraud in connection with commodity options
Case: 1:19-cv-02935 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/01/19 Page 3 of 20 PagelD #:3

transactions. Defendant Caniff also violated Section 9(a)(4) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 13(a)(4)
(2012), which prohibits making false statements to a registered entity.

5. Accordingly, pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1 (2012), the
Commission brings this action to enjoin Defendants’ unlawful acts and practices and to compel
Defendants’ compliance with the Act and the Regulations. In addition, the Commission seeks
civil monetary penalties, and remedial ancillary relief, including, but not limited to, trading and
registration bans, restitution, disgorgement, rescission, pre- and post-judgment interest, and such
other and further relief as the Court may deem necessary or appropriate.

6. Unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, Defendants will likely continue to
engage in acts and practices alleged in this Complaint and similar acts and practices, as described

below.

Hf. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

7. This Court has jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (2012)
(federal question jurisdiction) and 28 U.S.C. § 1345 (2012) (district courts have original
jurisdiction over civil actions commenced by the United States or by any agency expressly
authorized to sue by Act of Congress). Section 6c(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1(a) (2012),
authorizes the Commission to seek injunctive relief against any person whenever it shall appear
that such person has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in any act or practice that
violates any provision of the Act or any rule, regulation, or order promulgated thereunder.

8. Venue properly lies with this Court pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act,
TUS.C. § 13a-1(e) (2012), because Defendants have transacted business in the Northern
District of Illinois, and the acts and practices in violations of the Act and Regulations have

occurred within this District, among other places.

Hil. PARTIES

9. Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC” or
‘““Commission’’) is an independent federal regulatory agency charged with the administration and
enforcement of the Commodity Exchange Act and Regulations promulgated thereunder.

10. Defendant William Thomas Caniff is a natural person, 50 years of age, who
sometimes uses the alias “Thomas Caniff’ and resides in Steubenville, Ohio. Caniff is a co-
founder and General Partner of BCM Capital Management, LLC, and a limited partner of BBOT,
LP. Caniff transacted business as the trader for BBOT at NADEX, which is located in Chicago,
Illinois. Caniff has a criminal history as a felon, having been convicted of several financial
crimes in the 1990s. Caniff he has never been registered with the Commission in any capacity.

11. Defendant Arie Bos is a natural person, 59 years of age, who resides in Rotterdam
in the Netherlands and is a citizen of that country. Bos is a co-founder and Managing Partner of
BCM and is a limited partner of BBOT and Berkley IH. Bos was responsible for all “marketing”
on behalf of BCM, and for “administration and reporting” to the funds limited partners and for
“membership management” of BBOT and Berkley II and for the limited partnership’s offerings.
Bos has never been registered with the Commission in any capacity.

12. Defendant BCM Capital Management, LLC, formed in January 2016, is a
Wyoming limited company with offices in Wintersville, Ohio and Rotterdam in the Netherlands.
BCM is the general partner of BBOT and Berkley II. BCM acted as the “portfolio manager” for
the BBOT fund. BCM has never been registered with the Commission in any capacity.

13. Defendant BBOT1 LP is a Delaware limited partnership, formed in January
2016, which has its principal place of business in Wintersville, Ohio and transacts business in the
State of Illinois at NADEX. BBOT has never been registered with the Commission in any

capacity.
14. Defendant Berkley II LP is a Delaware limited partnership, formed in July 2017,
which has its principal place of business in Wintersville, Ohio. Berkley II has never been
registered with the Commission in any capacity.

IV. OTHER RELEVANT ENTITY

15. The North American Derivatives Exchange is a Commission designated
contract market under Section 5 of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 5 (2012). As such a designated contract
market, NADEX also meets the definition of a “registered entity” under Section 1(a)40 of the
Act, 7 U.S.C. § 1(a)40 (2012). NADEX provides a platform for retail customers to trade binary
options that are commodity option transactions. NADEX is located in Chicago, Illinois.

V. STATUTORY BACKGROUND

16. Section 4c(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 6c(b) (2012), makes it unlawful for any
person to offer to enter into, enter into, or confirm the execution of, any transaction involving
any commodity regulated under the Act which is of the character of, or is commonly known to
the trade as, inter alia, an “option”, “bid”, “offer’’, “put’’, or “call”, contrary to any rule,
regulation or order of the Commission prohibiting any such transaction or allowing any such
transaction under such terms and conditions as the Commission shall prescribe. Thus, through
7 U.S.C. § 6c(b), Congress has given the Commission jurisdiction and plenary rulemaking
authority over all commodity option transactions.

17. Regulation 32.4, 17 C.F.R. § 32.4 (2018), promulgated under Section 4c(b) of the
Act, provides that:

In or in connection with an offer to enter into, the entry into, or the confirmation of the

execution of, any commodity option transaction, it shall be unlawful for any person,
directly or indirectly:
a) To cheat or defraud or attempt to cheat or defraud any other person;
b) To make or cause to be made to any other person any false report or
statement thereof or cause to be entered for any person any false
record thereof; or
C) To deceive or attempt to deceive any other person by any means
whatsoever.
VI. FACTS
A. Overview of Binary Options
18. Binary options involve a variety of underlying assets, including currency pairs

(e.g., EUR/USD); commodities such as oil, wheat, coffee, and gold; equity indices (e.g., the Dow
Jones Industrial Index); and stocks (e.g., Coke, Google, etc.). However, unlike other types of
options, a binary option does not give the holder the right to purchase or sell the underlying
asset. Instead, binary options are “cash settled.” When the binary option expires, if the customer
has correctly predicted the asset’s movement, the customer is “in the money” and entitled to a
payout of a pre-determined amount of money. Binary options offered at NADEX also give the
holder the option to sell prior to expiration, which would allow the holder to reap a sum less than
the premium if the position is in the money and suffer losses less than the premium if the option
is out of the money. If the customer has made an incorrect prediction, he or she is “out of the
money,” loses the premium paid, and gets nothing.

19. There are only three designated contract markets currently authorized to offer
binary options that are commodity options transactions to retail customers in the United States:
Cantor Exchange LP, Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Inc., and NADEX.

B. Caniff and Bos Formed BCM to Trade Binary Options

20. In January 2016, Caniff and Bos formed a partnership and created a new

“investment and trading technology firm” called BCM. This new Wyoming limited liability
> OF AN PS PEA ee

Ne ~The Tw ee j

age * of 2O Parnell #?
Med Poa Po CALA DAL

corporation has offices near each of their residences, in Steubenville, Ohio and Rotterdam in the
Netherlands, respectively, and purportedly “specialized in trading foreign-exchange binary
options derivatives.”

21. BCM became the general partner of a new investment pool fund called BBOT
that was set up as a limited partnership for this pool of participants.

22. Caniff was the designated trader for the fund, and Bos was responsible for
soliciting and reporting to participants.

23. Bos solicited participants by initially approaching members of his family and
friends in the Netherlands. Bos distributed an information packet to prospective participants that
described Caniff as having trading experience dating back to 2004 with a “proven track record.”

24. Bos instructed prospective participants to wire their funds to the pools’ various
bank accounts in the United States. Participants wired approximately $1.8 million to BBOT in
2016 and approximately $3 million to BBOT and Berkley I in 2017 and thereafter.

25. In February 2016, Caniff set up bank accounts for both BCM and the pool,
BBOT. In December 2016, he closed those accounts and opened new accounts for BCM and
BBOT at a different bank. In April 2017, Caniff moved the BCM and BBOT bank accounts to a
third banking institution and, in July 2017, opened an additional account for the new Berkley II
pool at the third bank.

26. During the Relevant Time, Caniff made all financial decisions for BCM, BBOT
and Berkley II. He directed withdrawals of client funds from the BBOT and Berkley II bank
accounts and deposits and withdrawals of fund from the BCM bank account and the BBOT
trading account. Bos was not a signatory to any of the bank accounts, but he had online access to

view the BBOT, Berkley I and BCM bank account statements.
C. Caniff Concealed his Criminal Background from NADEX and Opened a Trading
Account

27. In June 2016, Caniff opened a binary options trading account for BBOT at
NADEX, but, in doing so, hid his extensive criminal past from NADEX by falsifying his
application for that account. In connection with his February 25, 2016 application to NADEX,
Caniff willfully made a false statement to NADEX by intentionally responding in the negative to
each of the following two questions:

(a) Have you been convicted of, pled guilty to, or entered a plea of no contest
or plea agreement to, any felony in any domestic, foreign, or military
court?

(b) Have you been convicted of, pled guilty to, or entered a plea of no contest
or plea agreement to, a misdemeanor in any domestic, foreign, or military
court or military court which involves: Embezzlement, theft, extortion,
fraud, fraudulent conversion, forgery, counterfeiting, false pretenses,
bribery, gambling, racketeering, or misappropriation of funds, securities,
or property?

28. The responses Caniff gave to NADEX were false because Caniff had been
convicted of several felony offenses including ones involving fraudulent conversion, forgery,
and grand theft with a firearm. According to NADEX, it would have rejected Caniff’s
application to open the BBOT trading account if it had known about these criminal convictions.

D. Caniff Minimally Funded the NADEX Account and Misappropriated Most of the
Participants’ Money

29. From February 2016 through the present, at least 62 BCM participants, two of
whom were U.S. customers, paid more than $4.8 million to fund investments to trade binary
options through pools in the names of BBOT or Berkley II.

30. Over the life of the account, Caniff only sent two payments to NADEX, $35,000

in June 2016 and $50,000 in June 2017, for a total of $85,000. Thus, a mere fraction of BBOT
or Berkley II participant funds were ever sent to NADEX for trading. Caniff never opened a
NADExX< trading account for Berkley II participants.

31. Caniff misappropriated the remainder of participant funds, by sending
approximately $2.3 million to repay other participants and to pay Bos and himself between $1.1
and $1.2 million each in purported fees. Approximately $2.5 million is presently owing to
participants.

E. Bos Ignored Obvious Red Flags and Made Misrepresentations to Prospective
Participants

32. Throughout their partnership, Caniff sent Bos emails reflecting his purported
daily trading activity at NADEX, some of which included purported screen shots showing the
NADEX account balance for the BCM pools. Caniff’s emails reflected implausible rates of
return and consistently profitable trading.

33. Bos combined the NADEX account value information that he received from
Caniff with the information Bos obtained from his online access to the pools’ bank accounts to
calculate the pools’ overall profitability and individual participants’ returns. Bos inserted his
profit calculations into statements sent to participants and into promotional packets of
information that he prepared and distributed to prospective participants without any independent
verification of these profits. For example, Bos told prospective participants:

(a) For the period January 2016 through May 2016, BCM reported monthly

net return on investments (“ROIs’’) of 3.9%, 17.3%, 23%, 11.6% and
17.3%;

(b) BCM’s fund grew to a size of $5,500,000 by the end of calendar year
2016;

(c) BCM’s average monthly ROI for 2016 was 10%;

(d) Berkley II had an ROI of 14.4% in April 2018; and
(e)

34.

Berkley II had an overall average monthly return on invested capital of
13.9% between August 2017 and April 2018.

Each of the aforementioned representations that Bos made to prospective

participants was false, in that:

(a)

(b)

(Cc)

(d)

(e)

35.

BCM’s reported monthly profits for the period from January to May 2016
were false in that BBOT’s account at NADEX was not even opened and
funded until June 29, 2016;

BCM’s fund did not have a value of $5,5000,000 by the end of 2016;
rather, the BBOT account value combined with balances in BBOT’s bank
account was $277,961.89 at December 31, 2016; and

BCM did not average a 10% ROI for 2016; rather the average ROI for
2016 was a negative, specifically -0.88%;

Berkley II did not have an ROI of 14.4% in April 2018 because BCM
never opened an account at NADEX for Berkley II and, thus, there were
no profits earned for this pool; and

Berkley II did not have an overall average monthly return on invested
capital of 13.9% between August 2017 and April 2018 because BCM
never opened an account at NADEX for Berkley II and, thus, there were
no profits earned for this pool.

In sum, all of Bos’ claims of BCM’s multi-million dollar account values and high

profitability to prospective participants earned through binary options trading were fraudulent in

light of the actual deployment and misappropriation of participant funds. Berkley II never had

an account at NADEX and the only other BCM account at NADEX, BBOT, resulted in an

overall loss of $43,204.60. Further, the trading in the BBOT account at NADEX generated an

overall net rate of return of -5.54% and its highest account balance at any given time was only

$89,764.90. Instead, the vast majority of the $4.8 million of participant deposits into BCM’s

BBOT or Berkley I pools were simply withdrawn to pay Bos and Caniff fees or to pay

participant withdrawal requests in the manner of a Ponzi scheme.

10
36.

Throughout the relevant period, Bos willfully or recklessly ignored red flags that

should have prompted him to seek some corroboration of BCM’s incredible pool returns at

NADEX. Bos committed fraud in failing to do so and, instead, distributing the absurd profit

figures to existing participants and using them to solicit new participants. Among the red flags

that Bos ignored:

(a)

(b)

(Cc)

(d)

(e)

37.

Bos knew that, in 2016, participants had invested total capital of $1.74
million. In or around January 2017, Caniff gave Bos a copy of a purported
NADEX IRS Form 1099 showing that BBOT’s total invested capital of
$1.8 million had made total profits in 2016 of $5,043,386.60.

When Bos told Caniff to withdraw a “substantial part” of the more than $5
million in profits from NADEX in January 2017 and return them to the
BBOT bank account, Caniff told Bos that the funds could not be
withdrawn from NADEX and gave Bos a number of transparently bogus
explanations.

In March 2017, Bos requested that Caniff arrange for him to have online
access to personally view the NADEX account balances. Caniff said that
such arrangements could not be made.

Bos routinely accessed the pools’ bank account statements and, thus, he
knew that they had only deposited a total of $85,000 with NADEX over
the life of the NADEX accounts. Yet, Bos accepted the patently absurd
rate of return on a statement dated May 2, 2017 sent to him by Caniff
showing that the BBOT account at NADEX had earned a balance in
excess of $11.8 million through the trading of participants’ funds.

In June 2017, Caniff falsely told Bos that he had initiated a lawsuit on
behalf of BBOT against NADEX’s bank claiming that NADEX was
illegally withholding BBOT’s funds.

Despite all of these red flags during the relevant period, Bos, inexplicably,

continued to solicit individuals to invest new monies to be sent to NADEX. Bos could have

contacted NADEX directly to verify the account balances at any time, but he did not do so until

September 2018.

11
F. Bos Issued False Account Statements
38. In addition to the false solicitations, Bos issued false account statements to at least

one participant. Participant M.Y. is a U.S. citizen who invested $100,000 with BBOT in January
2017. From January 2017 through July 2018, Bos prepared and sent M.Y. multiple “Individual
Account Statements” that falsely reported profits, or neglected to report losses incurred in her
account at BBOT and never reported a losing month of trading. For example, an account
statement dated August 10, 2018 indicated that participant M.Y.’s $100,000 investment had
increased to $146,035.21 by July 31, 2018. In fact, between January 2017 and July 2018, the
BBOT pool actually lost a net total of $40,569. Similarly, in the months of August and
September 2017, Bos reported a 0% ROI to M.Y. when, in fact, the BBOT pool actually had an
ROI for those months of -31.06% and -23.13%.

G. When the Money Ran Out, Caniff Blamed NADEX and Bos Continued to Solicit
Participants

39. After Bos made several requests for Caniff to distribute funds from the NADEX
account in early 2017, Caniff informed Bos that he was not able to withdraw funds from
NADEX and indicated that NADEX was wrongfully holding the pools’ funds.

AO. In May 2017, Bos informed M.Y. that BBOT had suspended trading because of
problems that had been encountered with NADEX. Although no fees were being earned from
trading during this time, Bos knew that funds continued to be withdrawn from the BBOT pool
bank account during this period, and that the funds were being used to pay fees to Caniff and
himself and to repay some investors. Nonetheless, Bos failed to report those expenses as
deductions from the participant’s account value and continued to report unchanged balances to

M.Y. on her account statement.

12
41. In June 2017, Caniff told Bos that he had initiated a lawsuit in Chicago on behalf
of BBOT against NADEX’s bank claiming that NADEX was illegally withholding BBOT’s
funds. In reality, Caniff never filed a lawsuit. Rather, Caniff sent Bos fabricated pleadings and
forged correspondence from an attorney purportedly representing BBOT in the dispute with
NADEX. After Bos received the fabricated pleadings, Bos, inexplicably, continued to solicit
individuals to invest new monies to be sent to NADEX for trading, while ignoring that BBOT
purportedly could not withdraw its participant funds already deposited there and this legal
entanglement with NADEX.

H. Bos Eventually Faced the Fraud and Filed a Related State Court Suit in Chicago

42. Over a year later, in September 2018, Bos finally contacted NADEX directly and
learned that the true balance of the NADEX trading account was approximately $6,824.00.

43. Bos eventually told participant M.Y. that Caniff had reported incorrect NADEX
trading results and that the total remaining participant funds were significantly less than
participants’ overall deposits. Participant M.Y. lost her entire investment of $100,000.

44. In an effort to recover any remaining funds, on February 1, 2019, Bos filed suit in
state court in Chicago, Illinois against Caniff alleging fraud by Caniff and seeking to prevent a
bank’s disbursement of $116,153.25 on deposit in accounts it holds in the names of BCM, BBOT
and Berkley II. The state court pleading is captioned: Arie Bos, and Berkley Capital
Management, LLC, on behalf of All Participants and Limited Partners of BBOT I, LP and
Berkley I, LP vy. William Thomas Caniff, Jr., an individual, BBOT 1, LP, a limited partnership,
Berkley I, LP and Huntington Bank, Circuit Court of Cook County, Chancery Division, No.
2019 CH 01264. A copy of the complaint filed in the state court is attached as part of the

Appendix accompanying this filing.

45. On February 11, 2019, Circuit Court Judge Atkins entered a TRO freezing the
accounts pending further order of the court. However, on April 24, 2019, the Court issued an

order vacating the asset freeze.

defraud, customers and prospective customers; (b) made or caused to be made to customers and
prospective customers false reports or statements; and (c) deceived or attempted to deceive
customers and prospective customers, in violations of 7 U.S.C. § 6c(b), and 17 C.F.R. § 32.4.

48. During the relevant period, Defendant Caniff violated 7 U.S.C. § 6c(b) and
17 C.F.R. § 32.4 by misappropriating approximately $2.5 million of participant funds and by
sending Bos emails about false daily trading activity and nonexistent trading profits that he knew
Bos would use to solicit participants and make false reports to existing participants.

49. During the relevant period, Defendant Bos violated 7 U.S.C. § 6c(b) and
17 C.F.R. § 32.4 by, among other things, recklessly telling prospective participants:

(a) For the period January 2016 through May 2016, BCM reported monthly net return

on investments (“ROIs”) of 3.9%, 17.3%, 23%, 11.6% and 17.3%;

14
(b) BCM’s fund grew to a size of $5,500,000 by the end of calendar year 2106; and

(c) BCM’s average monthly ROI for 2016 was 10%;

(d) Berkley II did not have an ROI of 14.4% in April 2018 because BCM never
opened an account at NADEX for Berkley II and, thus, there were no profits
earned for this pool; and

(e) Berkley II did not have an overall average monthly return on invested capital of
13.9% between August 2017 and April 2018 because BCM never opened an
account at NADEX for Berkley II and, thus, there were no profits earned for this
pool.

50. During the relevant period, Defendant Bos violated 7 U.S.C. § 6c(b) and

17 C.F.R. § 32.4 by, among others, sending at least one participant numerous false statements
reporting that her account was profitable when it was not profitable and, at times, failed to report
withdrawals from her account balance.

51. Defendants committed the acts and practices describes herein willfully, or with
reckless disregard for the truth.

52. Each act of misrepresentation, misappropriation and omission of material fact,
including, but not limited to, those specifically alleged herein, constitutes a separate and distinct
violations of 7 U.S.C. § 6c(b) and 17 C.F.R. § 32.4.

53. The foregoing acts, omissions and failures of Caniff and Bos, and all other agents
of BCM, occurred and are occurring within the scope of their employment, office or agency with
BCM;; therefore, BCM is liable for these acts, omissions and failures pursuant to Section

2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 2(a)(1.)(B) (2012), and Regulation 1.2, 17 C.F.R. § 1.2 (2018).
