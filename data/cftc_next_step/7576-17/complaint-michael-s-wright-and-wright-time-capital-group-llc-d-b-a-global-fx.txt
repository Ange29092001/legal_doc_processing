COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF,
RESTITUTION, AND CIVIL MONETARY PENALTIES
UNDER THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT

Plaintiff, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC” or “Commission’”), by

and through its attorneys, alleges as follows:
I. SUMMARY

1. From approximately August 2010 through the present (the “Relevant Period”),
Defendants Michael S. Wright and Wright Time Capital Group LLC (d/b/a “Global FX Club”)
(“WTCG,” and together with Wright, “Defendants”) have engaged in a fraudulent scheme to
solicit more than $400,000 from at least 10 members of the public (“pool participants’) to
participate in a pooled investment to engage in foreign currency (“forex”) trading. Rather than
use pool participants’ funds for forex trading as promised, Defendants have only traded a portion
of pool participants’ funds, misappropriated pool participants’ funds, and issued false account

statements to pool participants to conceal their trading losses and misappropriation.

2. In furtherance of the fraudulent scheme, Defendants made material misstatements
and omissions in solicitations to prospective pool participants, including misrepresenting that all
or substantially all of participants’ funds would be pooled and used to engage in forex trading.

3. In reality, Defendants only traded a portion of pool participants’ funds in forex.
Between August 2010 and April 2016, Defendants deposited approximately $115,800 into forex
trading accounts that were used to trade pool participants’ funds. As of mid-May 2016, those
forex trading accounts had suffered approximately $114,300 in trading losses. Defendants also
misappropriated pool participants’ funds for unauthorized personal or business expenses such as
food, clothing, jewelry, and entertainment.

4. In order to conceal their trading losses and misappropriation, Defendants made
and issued false pool participant account statements that inflated and misrepresented the value of
the accounts and the pool’s trading returns. The false account statements purported to reflect
positive trading gains for the pool during periods of time when Defendants did not actually
engage in any forex trading, or engaged in trading that was unprofitable.

5. Around the fall of 2016, pool participants began having difficulty contacting
Defendants. In or around early November 2016, Defendants misrepresented to a pool participant
who sought to withdraw funds from his account that the funds would be transferred to the pool
participant in approximately two weeks, but the pool participant never received the funds.

6. Around mid-to-late November or December 2016, Defendants cut off
communications with pool participants; stopped returning telephone calls, text messages, and
emails; and left pool participants unable to recover any funds from their accounts.

7. During the Relevant Period, Defendants WTCG and Wright also failed to operate

the commodity pool as a separate legal entity — by receiving pool funds in WTCG or Wright’s
name rather than the name of the commodity pool, receiving pool participant funds in a name
other than that of the pool, and by commingling pool funds with non-pool property — and failed
to register with the Commission as a commodity pool operator (“CPO”).

8. By virtue of this conduct and the conduct further described herein, Defendants,
either directly or as controlling persons, have engaged, are engaging, or are about to engage in
acts and practices in violations of Sections 4b(a)(2)(A)-(C), 4m(1), 40(1)(A)-(B), and
2(c)(2)(111)(1)(cc) of the Commodity Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. § et seq. (the “Act’”), 7 U.S.C. §§
6b(a)(2)(A)-(C), 6m(1), 60(1)(A)-(B), and 2(c)(2)(111)(1)(cc) (2012), and Commission
Regulations (“Regulations”) 4.20(a)-(c), 5.2(b)(1)-(3), and 5.3(a)(2), 17 C.F.R. § 4.20(a)-(c),
5.2(b)(1)-(3), and 5.3(a)(2) (2016).

9. During the Relevant Period, Defendant Wright was an officer, employee or agent
of WTCG. Therefore, WTCG is liable for the acts and omissions of Wright done in the scope of
his employment or office, pursuant to Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 2(a)(1)(B)
(2012), and Regulation 1.2, 17 C.F.R. § 1.2 (2016).

10. Defendant Wright was a controlling person of WTCG throughout the Relevant
Period and did not act in good faith or knowingly induced WTCG’s violations of the Act and
Regulations described herein. Therefore, Wright is liable for WT'CG’s violations of the Act and
Regulations, pursuant to Section 13(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 13c(b) (2012).

11. Accordingly, the Commission brings this action pursuant to Section 6c of the Act,
7 U.S.C. § 13a-1 (2012) and Section 2(c)(2)(C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 2(c)(2)(C) (2012), to
enjoin Defendants’ unlawful acts and practices, to compel their compliance with the Act and the
Regulations promulgated thereunder, and to enjoin them from engaging in any commodity

related activity. In addition, the Commission seeks civil monetary penalties, and remedial
Case 1:17-cv-04722 Documenti1 Filed 06/22/17 Page 4 of 27

ancillary relief, including, but not limited to, trading and registration bans, restitution,
disgorgement, rescission, pre- and post-judgment interest, and such other and further relief as the
Court may deem necessary and appropriate.

12. Unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, Defendants will likely continue to
engage in acts and practices alleged in this Complaint and similar acts and practices, as described
below.

II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

13. Section 6c(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1 (2012), authorizes the Commission to
seek injunctive and other relief against any person whenever it shall appear to the Commission
that such person has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in any act or practice
constituting a violations of any provision of the Act, or any rule, regulation, or order thereunder.

14. Venue lies properly with this Court pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
§ 13a-1(e) (2012), because Defendants transacted business in this District and certain
transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business alleged in this Complaint occurred, are
occurring, or are about to occur in this District.

trust, syndicate, or similar form of enterprise, and who, in connection therewith, solicits, accepts,
or receives from others, funds, securities, or property, either directly or through capital
contributions, the sale of stock or other forms of securities, or otherwise, for the purpose of
trading in commodity interests, including any .. . agreement, contract, or transaction described in
[Sections 2(c)(2)(C)(i) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. §§ 2(c)(2)(C)G) (2012)].”

pertinent part, and subject to certain exceptions not relevant here, that the Commission has
jurisdiction over any agreement, contract, or transaction in foreign currency if the transactions
are offered to or entered into with a person that is not an eligible contract participant (“ECP”) on
a leveraged or margined basis, and the transactions do not result in actual delivery within two
days or otherwise create an enforceable obligation to deliver between a seller and buyer that have
the ability to deliver and accept delivery, respectively, in connection with their line of business.

20. Section 2(c)(2)(C)(vii) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 2(c)(2)(C)(vil) (2012), provides that
the Act applies to, and the Commission shall have jurisdiction over, an account or pooled

investment vehicle that is offered for the purpose of trading, or that trades, any agreement,
contract or transaction in foreign currency described in Section 2(c)(2)(C)G) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
§ 2(c)(2)(C)G) (2012).

21. Section 2(c)(2)(C)G() of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 2(c)(2)(C)GC) (2012), states that
Sections 4b and 40 of the Act, 7 U.S.C. §§ 6b and 60, apply to pooled investment vehicles that
are offered for the purpose of trading, or that trade, any forex agreement, contract, or transaction,
and that involve persons or entities who are not ECPs.

22. Section 2(c)(2)(C)(iv) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 2(c)(2)(C) (iv) (2012), states that
Section 4b of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 6b, applies to forex agreements, contracts, or transactions “as
if” they were contracts of sale of a commodity for future delivery.

23. Section 1a(18) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 1a(18) (2012), defines an ECP, in relevant
part, as (1) a commodity pool that (i) has total assets exceeding $5,000,000 and (ii) is formed or
operated by a person subject to regulation under the Act, provided that for purposes of Section
2(c)(2)(C)(vi1) of the Act the term ECP shall not include a commodity pool in which any
participant is not otherwise an eligible contract participant, see 7 U.S.C. § 1a(18)(iv) (2012), or
(2) an individual who has amounts invested on a discretionary basis, the aggregate of which
exceeds $10 million, or $5 million if the individual enters into the transaction to manage the risk
associated with an asset owned or liability incurred, or reasonably likely to be owned or incurred,

forex transactions is defined as a retail forex CPO.

26. Regulation 5.1(m), 17 C.F.R. § 5.1(m) (2016), defines a retail forex transaction in
relevant part as any account, agreement, contract or transaction described in Section 2(c)(2)(C)
of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 2(c)(2)(C) (2012). A retail forex transaction does not include an account,
agreement, contract or transaction in foreign currency that is a contract of sale of a commodity
for future delivery (or an option thereon) that is executed, traded on or otherwise subject to the
rules of a contract market designated pursuant to Section 5(a) of the Act.

Vv. FACTS
A. Defendants’ Fraudulent Solicitations, False Statements, and Misappropriation

27. During the Relevant Period, WTCG, by and through its officers, employees or
agents, fraudulently solicited pool participants to invest in a commodity pool for forex trading,
issued false account statements to pool participants, and misappropriated pool participants’
funds. In furtherance of the fraudulent scheme, Defendants made misrepresentations and
omissions to pool participants and prospective pool participants in written solicitations and
correspondence sent via email and mail and through telephone calls.

28. The fraudulent solicitations included, but were not limited to, misrepresentations
by Defendants that all or substantially all of pool participants’ funds would be pooled and used to
engage in forex trading.

29. For example, in or around December 4, 2013, Defendants told one prospective

pool participant in a written solicitation that his $30,000 investment would be pooled and used
for forex trading and that after 100% profit was made, the gains thereafter would be split with the
pool participant 85/15 in favor of WTCG.

30. Defendants told other prospective pool participants in oral and written
solicitations that WT'CG would charge no fee, or a “fairly low” fee, until the pool participant’s
money doubled, after which point the pool participant would be charged a fee of 85% on
additional profits.

31. These representations were false because, as described further below, Defendants
did not use all of pool participants’ funds to engage in forex trading and instead misappropriated
pool participants’ funds for unauthorized personal and business expenses.

32. Through the misrepresentations described above, Defendants WTCG, by and
through their officers, employees, and agents, fraudulently solicited and obtained over $400,000
from at least 10 persons to invest in a forex commodity pool.

33. Defendants deposited a portion of the pool participant funds they received into a
bank account at a banking institution (“Bank 1”) held in the name of Michael Wright or into
bank accounts at two other banking institutions (“Bank 2” and “Bank 3”) held in the name of,
and for the benefit of, WTCG.

34. Defendant Wright was the sole authorized signatory of WTCG’s bank accounts at
Bank 2 and Bank 3.

35. During the Relevant Period, Defendants made multiple withdrawals from WTCG
bank accounts from automated teller machines (ATMs) in New York County. For example,
Defendants withdrew over $400 from a WTCG bank account from an ATM on 7th Avenue in

Manhattan on February 20, 2013.
36. In or around August 2010, Defendant Wright opened an individual forex trading
account at a forex trading firm (“Forex Trading Firm 1”), a registered Futures Commission
Merchant (“FCM”) and Retail Foreign Exchange Dealer (“RFED”). The forex trading account at
Forex Trading Firm | (“Forex Trading Account 1”) was held in the name of, and for the benefit
of, Michael Wright, not for the commodity pool operated by Defendants. Defendant Wright was
the sole signatory of Forex Trading Account 1 and was the only person who had authority to
trade the account.

37. In or around July 2015, Defendant Wright opened an individual forex trading
account at a second forex trading firm (“Forex Trading Firm 2”), a registered Futures
Commission Merchant and Retail Foreign Exchange Dealer. The forex trading account at Forex
Trading Firm 2 (“Forex Trading Account 2,” and together with Forex Trading Account 1, the
“Forex Trading Accounts”) was held in the name of, and for the benefit of, Michael Wright, not
for the commodity pool operated by Defendants. Defendant Wright was the sole signatory of
Forex Trading Account 2 and was the only person who had authority to trade the account.

38. Defendants transferred some but not all of the funds they received from pool
participants into the Forex Trading Accounts. Between August 2010 and April 2016, Defendants
deposited approximately $115,800 into the Forex Trading Accounts. During the same time
period, Defendants withdrew approximately $820 from the Forex Trading Accounts.

39. — At all relevant times, Wright individually and on behalf of WTCG, controlled and
directed the forex trading in the Forex Trading Accounts.

AO. Through the Forex Trading Accounts, Defendants engaged in forex transactions

on a leveraged or margined basis that did not result in actual delivery within two days or
Gerth

wR AL PMA WTAE PD oe

otherwise create an enforceable obligation to deliver between a seller and buyer that have the
ability to deliver and accept delivery, respectively, in connection with their line of business.

Al. As of mid-May 2016, the Forex Trading Accounts incurred, on a net basis,
realized trading losses of approximately $114,300.

42. Instead of using all or substantially all of pool participants’ funds for forex trading
as promised, Defendants misappropriated the majority of pool participants’ funds for
unauthorized purposes.

43. Defendants failed to disclose to pool participants that Defendants did not invest
all pool participant funds as promised in forex trading.

44. Defendant Wright, through his control over his and WTCG’s bank accounts,
personally misappropriated pool participants’ funds for unauthorized personal or business
expenses such as food, clothing, jewelry, and entertainment.

45. For example, on February 25, 2013, Defendants spent, or caused to be spent, over
$1,000 at a department store on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan using funds from a WTCG bank
account. Similarly, on September 9, 2013 and January 5, 2014, Defendants spent, or caused to
be spent, over $4,000 and $1,000 respectively at luxury jewelers in Midtown, Manhattan using
funds from a WTCG bank account.

46. During the Relevant Period, Defendants knowingly made, or caused to be made,
false account statements that inflated and misrepresented the value of pool participants’ accounts
and the pool’s trading returns.

47. Defendants sent false accounts statements via email on January 14, 2016 and July

6, 2016 to at least one pool participant that resided in New York County, New York.

10
A8. The false account statements purported to reflect profitable earnings in the pool
for periods when Defendants knew, or had to be aware, that there were in fact no such profitable
earnings because Defendants were not engaging in forex trading at the time and because there
was an overall significant decrease in the net value of the pool due to the combined effect of
Defendants’ unprofitable forex trading and misappropriation.

49, For example, shortly after the end of the second quarter of 2016, Defendants
made, or caused to be made, false and misleading account statements and sent them to at least six
pool participants via email. The statements showed bar graphs that created the appearance that
the pool had consistent positive forex trading returns ranging from +1.08% a month to +18.81%
a month for each month from November 2014 through June 2016. These statements were false,
however, because in reality, WTCG did not engage in any forex trading from November 2014
through March 2015, mid-July 2015 through September 2015, or after mid-May 2016.
Moreover, the forex trading Defendants did engage in for certain periods between April 2015
and mid-May 2016 resulted in overall trading losses.

50. Although Defendants did not engage in any forex trading after mid-May 2016,
Defendants continued to make and issue false pool participant account statements that created
the appearance of pool forex trading gains through the end of the third quarter 2016.

51. The false account statements Defendants made or caused to be made also inflated
and misrepresented the value of the pool participants’ accounts. For example, the individual
account statements for the second quarter of 2016 for six pool participants, sent via email shortly
after the end of the second quarter of 2016, showed account values that totaled in excess of
$678,000 when combined. In reality, most or all of the pool participants’ funds had been lost

due to Defendants’ trading losses and misappropriation.

11
52. Defendants did not disclose to pool participants that the pool suffered significant
trading losses or that some or all of their funds were actually misappropriated and never used for
forex trading.

53. By making and issuing such account statements, Defendants knowingly either
misrepresented or attempted to misrepresent to pool participants, or willfully deceived or
attempted to deceive pool participants, on multiple occasions during the Relevant Period.

54. Defendant Wright knew or should have known that pool funds were being
misappropriated and not used for forex trading because he controlled his and WTCG’s bank and
trading accounts and engaged in the misappropriation himself.

55. Around the fall of 2016, pool participants began having difficulty contacting
Defendants.

56. In or around November 2016, Defendants made misrepresentations to at least one
pool participant regarding the availability of pool funds for withdrawal. On November 1, 2016, a
pool participant sent an email request to Defendants to withdrawal $200,000 from his account.
The next day, Defendants responded via an email that falsely created the appearance that the
pool participant’s funds would be returned in approximately two weeks. The email stated that
WTCG was in receipt of the pool participant’s request and that it would have to (1) close
positions, which would be done by the end of the week, (2) transfer funds from its trading
account to Bank 2, which would take approximately 3-5 business days, and (3) then transfer the
funds to the pool participant via ACH-Wire, which would take 2-3 business days. After more
than two weeks, however, the pool participant never received the funds. To date, Defendants

have not returned the pool participant’s funds.

12
57. | Around mid-to-late November or December 2016, Defendants stopped
communicating with pool participants or returning pool participants’ emails, telephone calls, and
text messages. Pool participants have been unable to recover funds from their accounts.

58. At no time during the Relevant Period did any purported commodity pool
operated by Defendants qualify as an ECP. The purported commodity pool operated by
Defendants during the Relevant Period was a non-ECP, and was therefore subject to the
jurisdiction of the Commission, because (1) at no time during the Relevant Period did the pool
have assets in excess of $5,000,000, (2) at no time during the Relevant Period was any purported
commodity pool formed and operated by a person subject to regulation under the Act, because
none of the Defendants were properly registered with the Commission as a CPO, and (3) at all
times during the Relevant Period, one or more pool participants did not qualify as an ECP, as
defined by Section 1a(18)(A)(ix) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 1a(18)(A)(x) (2012).

B. Commingling Pool Funds and Failure to Operate Pool as Separate Entity

59. WTCG, while acting as a CPO, also failed to operate its commodity pool as a
separate legal entity, received pool funds in the name of Wright or WTCG rather than the pool,
and commingled pool funds with non-pool property by depositing pool funds into the bank
accounts of Wright or WTCG rather than a separate bank account for the pool.

C. Defendants’ Failure to Register With the Commission

60. During the Relevant Period, Defendant WTCG, by and through its officers,
employees or agents, used the mails, emails, wire transfers, websites, and other means or
instrumentalities of interstate commerce, to solicit pool participants and prospective pool

participants.

13
6l. WTCG was never registered as a CPO. During the Relevant Period, WTCG acted
as a CPO by engaging in a business that is of the nature of a commodity pool and, in connection
with that business, soliciting and accepting pool funds from participants for the purpose of
trading in forex transactions described in Section 2(c)(2)(C)(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. §
2(c)(2)(C)() (2012), which were not transactions in foreign currency executed, traded on, or
otherwise subject to the rules of a designated contract market pursuant to Section 5(a) of the Act.

62. During the Relevant Period, WTCG was not statutorily exempt or excluded from
registration as aCPO. Moreover, WTCG never filed any electronic or written notice with the
National Futures Association that 1t was exempt or excluded from registration as a CPO, as
required by Commission Regulations 4.5(c) and 4.13(b)(1).

D. Controlling Person Liability

63. Throughout the Relevant Period, Defendant Wright was the CEO, founder, and
chief strategist of WTCG.

64. During the Relevant Period, Defendant Wright did not act in good faith or
knowingly induced WTCG and its officers’, employees’ or agents’ violations of the Act and
Commission Regulations by personally making the misrepresentations and omissions described
above concerning how the funds would be used and the availability of funds for withdrawal;
making false account statements and sending them to pool participants; and misappropriating, or
causing WTCG to misappropriate, pool participants’ funds. Wright knew or should have known
that WTCG was not using pool participants’ funds to trade forex, that he had been making false
account statements, and that he had been misappropriating pool participant funds. Wright also
failed to remove or correct Defendants’ misrepresentations and failed to disclose the

misappropriation of pool participant funds.

69. Defendant WTCG, by and through its officers, employees, and agents, and Wright

5.2(b)(1)-(3), 17 C.F.R. § 5.2(b)(1)-(3) (2016), by making false representations and omissions
including but not limited to (1) misrepresenting to prospective pool participants that all or
substantially all of participants’ funds would be pooled and used to engage in forex trading; (2)
sending pool participants false account statements that inflated and misrepresented the value of
their accounts and the pool’s trading returns; (3) misrepresenting that pool participant funds were
available for withdrawal; and (4) misappropriating pool participants’ funds for unauthorized
personal or business expenses rather than engaging in retail forex trading and failing to disclose
that pool participants’ funds had been misappropriated.

70. In soliciting pool participants and prospective pool participants, Defendants
WTCG and Wright directly violated Section 4b(a)(2)(A) and (C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. §
6b(a)(2)(A) and (C) (2012), and Commission Regulation 5.2(b)(1) and (3), 17 C.F.R. § 5.2(b)(1)
and (3) (2016), by falsely representing that all or substantially all of pool participants’ funds

by misappropriating WTCG pool participants’ funds for unauthorized personal or business

73. The foregoing acts, omissions, and failures occurred within the scope of Wright’s
employment or office with WTCG. Therefore, WTCG 1s liable for Wright’s acts, omissions, and

1.2, 17 C.F.R. § 1.2 (2016).

74. Defendant Wright held and exercised direct and indirect control over WTCG and
either did not act in good faith or knowingly induced WTCG’s violations of Sections
Ab(a)(2)(A)-(C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 6b(a)(2)(A)-(C) (2012), and Commission Regulation
5.2(b)(1)-(3), 17 C.F.R. § 5.2(b)(1)-(3) (2016). As a controlling person of WT'CG, Wright is

COUNT TWO

violations of Section 40(1)(A)-(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 60(1)(A)-(B)
(Fraud and Deceit by a CPO)

76. Paragraphs 1| through 75 are re-alleged and incorporated herein by reference.

77. During the Relevant Period, WTCG engaged in a business, for compensation or
profit, that is of the nature of a commodity pool, investment trust, syndicate, or similar form of
enterprise, and in connection therewith, solicited, accepted, or received from others, funds,
securities, or property, either directly or through capital contributions, the sale of stock or other
forms of securities, or otherwise, for the purpose of trading in commodity interests, including in
relevant part transactions in foreign currency. Therefore, WTCG constituted a CPO as defined
by Section la(11) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § la(11) (2012).

78. An Associated Person (“AP”) of a CPO is defined by Regulation 1.3(aa)(3) as any
person who is a partner, officer, employee, consultant, or agent (or any natural person occupying
a similar status or performing similar functions), in any capacity which involves (1) the
solicitation of funds, securities, or property for a participation in a commodity pool or (11) the
supervision of any person or persons so engaged. During the Relevant Period, Defendant Wright
acted as an AP of WTCG.

79. During the Relevant Period, WTCG was not registered with the Commission as a
CPO.

80. Section 40(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 60(1) (2012), prohibits CPOs and APs of
CPOs, whether registered with the Commission or not, from using the mails or any means or
instrumentality of interstate commerce, directly or indirectly, from (A) employing devices,

schemes or artifices to defraud any client or participant or prospective client or participant,

18
and/or (B) engaging in transactions, practices, or courses of business which operated as a fraud
or deceit upon any client or participant or prospective client or participant.

81. While acting in its capacity as a CPO, Defendant WTCG, by and through its
officers, agents or employees, knowingly or recklessly: (1) misrepresented in solicitations that all
or substantially all of participants’ funds would be pooled and used to engaged in forex trading;
(2) made and sent to pool participants false account statements that inflated and misrepresented
the value of their accounts and the pool’s trading returns; (3) misrepresented that pool participant
funds were available for withdrawal; and (4) misappropriated pool participants’ funds for
unauthorized personal or business expenses rather than trading retail forex transactions and failed
to disclose that pool participants’ funds had been misappropriated. Therefore, WTCG violated
Section 40(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 60(1) (2012).

82. Defendant Wright directly violated Section 40(1)(A)-(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. §
60(1)(A)-(B) (2012), while acting in the capacity as an AP of CPO Defendant WTCG, by (1)
misrepresenting in solicitations that all or substantially all of participants’ funds would be pooled
and used to engaged in forex trading; (2) making and sending to pool participants false account
statements that inflated and misrepresented the value of their accounts and the pool’s trading
returns; (3) misrepresenting that pool participant funds were available for withdrawal; and (4)
misappropriating pool participants’ funds for unauthorized personal or business expenses rather
than trading retail forex transactions and failing to disclose that pool participants’ funds had been
misappropriated.

83. The foregoing acts, omissions, and failures of Defendant Wright occurred within
the scope of his employment or office with WTCG. Therefore, WTCG is liable for Wright’s

acts, omissions, and failures in violations of Section 40(1)(A)-(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 60(1)(A)-

19

(B) (2012), pursuant to Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, as amended, 7 U.S.C. § 2(a)(1)(B) (2012),
and Regulation 1.2, 17 C.F.R. § 1.2 (2016).

84. Defendant Wright held and exercised direct and indirect control over WTCG and
either did not act in good faith or knowingly induced WTCG’s violations of Section 40(1)(A)-
(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 60(1)(A)-(B) (2012). As a controlling person of WTCG, Wright is
liable for WTCG’s violations of Section 40(1)(A)-(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 60(1)(A)-(B)
(2012), pursuant to Section 13(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 13c(b) (2012).

85. Each misrepresentation, omission of material fact, false statement, and
misappropriation, including but not limited to those specifically alleged herein, is alleged as a
separate and distinct violations of Section 40(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 60(1) (2012).

violations of Sections 2(c)(2)(C)Gii)()(cc) and 4m(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 8§
2(c)(2)(C) (iii) D(cc) and 6m(1), and Regulation 5.3(a)(2), 17 C.F.R. § 5.3(a)(2)
(Failure to Register as a Retail Forex CPO)

86. Paragraphs 1| through 85 are re-alleged and incorporated herein by reference.

87. Section 2(c)(2)(C)aii)(I)(cc) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 2(c)(2)(C)Gi)(D)(cc) (2012),
prohibits a person, unless registered in the capacity as required in Commission rule, from
operating or soliciting funds for a pooled investment vehicle that is not an ECP in connection
with forex transactions described in Section 2(c)(2)(C)(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 2(c)(2)(C)()
(2012).

88. During the Relevant Period, Defendant WTCG was not registered as a CPO while
it operated and solicited funds for a pooled investment vehicle that was not an ECP while

engaged in forex transactions described in Section 2(c)(2)(C)(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. §

20
2(c)(2)(C)). Therefore, Defendant WTCG was in violations of Section 2(c)(2)(C)(ii)(1)(cc) of
the Act.

89. Section 4m(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C § 6m(1), makes it unlawful for any CPO,
unless registered with the Commission, to make use of the mails or any means or instrumentality
of interstate commerce in connection with its business as a CPO.

90. During the Relevant Period, WTCG engaged in a business, for compensation or
profit, that is of the nature of a commodity pool, investment trust, syndicate, or similar form of
enterprise, and in connection therewith, solicited, accepted, or received from others, funds,
securities, or property, either directly or through capital contributions, the sale of stock or other
forms of securities, or otherwise, for the purpose of trading in commodity interests, including in
relevant part transactions in foreign currency described in Section 2(c)(2)(C)(i) of the Act, 7
U.S.C. § 2(c)(2)(C)a). Therefore, WTCG constituted a CPO as defined by Section 1a(11) of the
Act, 7 U.S.C. § la(11) (2012).

91. During the Relevant Period, WTCG, while using the mails or means of interstate
commerce in connection with business as a CPO, was not registered with the Commission as a
CPO. Thus, WTCG acted as an unregistered CPO in violations of Section 4m(1) of the Act, 7
U.S.C. § 6m(1) (2012).

92. Regulation 5.3(a)(2), 17 C.F.R. § 5.3(a)(2) (2016), requires any CPO engaged in
retail forex transactions to register with the Commission. Regulation 5.1(d)(1), 17 C.F.R. §
5.1(d)(1) (2016), defines a CPO as any person who “operates or solicits funds, securities, or
property for a pooled investment vehicle that is not an eligible contract participant as defined

section la(18) of the Act, and that engages in retail forex transactions.”

21
Case 1:17-cv-04722 Document1 Filed 06/22/17 Page 22 of 27

93. During the Relevant Period, WTCG solicited funds, securities, or property for a
pooled investment vehicle that was not an ECP and engaged in retail forex transactions (as
defined by Regulation 5.1(m), 17 C.F.R. § 5.1(m) (2016)). Thus, WTCG acted as a CPO
engaged in retail forex transactions as defined by Regulation 5.1(d)(1), 17 C.F.R. § 5.1(d)(1)
(2016), and was not otherwise exempt or excluded from registration as a CPO. Because WTCG
was not registered with the Commission as a CPO and engaged in retail forex transactions, it
violated Regulation 5.3(a)(2)(1), 17 C.F.R. § 5.3(a)(2)() (2016).

94. Wright held and exercised direct and indirect control over WTCG and either did
not act in good faith or knowingly induced WTCG’s violations of Sections 2(c)(2)(C)(ii1)(1)(cc)
and 4m(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. §§ 2(c)(2)(C)G)(1)(cc) and 6m(1) (2012), and Regulation
5.3(a)(2)), 17 C.F.R. § 5.3(a)(2)() (2016). As a controlling person pursuant to Section 13(b) of
the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 13c(b) (2012), Wright is liable for WTCG’s violations of Sections
2(c)(2)(C)a1i)(1)(cc) and 4m(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. §§ 2(c)(2)(C)ai)(1)(cc) and 6m(1) (2012),

95. Paragraphs 1| through 94 are re-alleged and incorporated herein by reference.

96. Commission Regulation 5.4, 17 C.F.R. § 5.4 (2016), states that Part 4 of the
Regulations, 17 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, et seg., apply to any person required to register as a CPO pursuant

to Part 5 of the Regulations relating to forex transactions. 17 C.F.R. §§ 5.1, et seq.

97. Commission Regulation 4.20(a), 17 C.F.R. § 4.20(a) (2016), requires a CPO,
whether registered or not, to operate its commodity pool as a legal entity separate from that of
the CPO.

98. Commission Regulation 4.20(b), 17 C.F.R. § 4.20(b) (2016), prohibits CPOs,
whether registered or not, from receiving pool participants’ funds in any name other than that of
the pool.

99. Commission Regulation 4.20(c), 17 C.F.R. § 4.20(c) (2016), prohibits a CPO,
whether registered or not, from commingling the property of any pool it operates with the
property of any other person.

100. During the Relevant Period, WTCG, while acting as a CPO, violated Commission
Regulation 4.20(a)-(c), 17 C.F.R. § 4.20(a)-(c) (2016), by: (1) failing to operate a commodity
pool as a legal entity separate from Wright or WTCG; (2) receiving pool participants’ funds in
the names of Wright or WTCG rather than the commodity pool; and (3) commingling the
property of the pool with property of Defendants or others.

101. Defendant Wright held and exercised direct and indirect control over WTCG and
either did not act in good faith or knowingly induced WTCG’s violations of Regulation 4.20(a)-
(c), 17 C.F.R. § 4.20(a)-(c) (2016). As a controlling person of WTCG, Wright is liable for
WTCG’s violations of Regulation 4.20(a)-(c), 17 C.F.R. § 4.20(a)-(c) (2016), pursuant to Section
13(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 13c(b) (2012).
