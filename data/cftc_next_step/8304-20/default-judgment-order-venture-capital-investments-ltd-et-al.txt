FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLORADO

COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION,

Plaintiff,

CLARK,

Defendant.

ORDER GRANTING
MOTION FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT

BACKGROUND

Because this case is before the court on the Commission’s motion for entry of
default judgment and Defendants have failed to answer or otherwise respond to the
complaint, the court deems as true the material well-pleaded allegations in the
complaint. Pers. Indus. Loan Corp. v. Forgay, 240 F.2d 18, 20 (10th Cir. 1956) (“By
failing to appear and permitting a default judgment to be entered, [the defendant]
admitted only facts well pleaded.”’). “In addition, the court accepts the undisputed
facts set forth in any affidavits and exhibits.” Purzel Video GmbH v. Biby, 13 F.
Supp. 3d 1127, 1135 (D. Colo. 2014).

This case arises from Defendants’ fraudulent solicitations of seventytwo
participants to trade foreign and electronic currencies (also known as “forex”),
including Bitcoin and Altcoin in a commodity pool operated by Defendants.

Compl., Doc. 1 at { 24. A “commodity pool” sounds like what it is: an entity formed

-l-
Case 1:20-cy-O0882-DDD-MEH Bocument 30 Filed 11/02/20 USDC Colorada Page 2 af 14

to trade commodity interests, see 7 U.S.C. § la(10). Defendants found pool
participants through social media, email, webinars, and face-to-face meetings. Id.
A commodity pool isn’t necessarily illegal, but this one was. Defendants ultimately
solicited $535,829 from the pool participants, misappropriating $450,302 of that
sum for personal use and, in a small-time imitation of a Bernie-MadoffPonzi
scheme, for making payments to pool members so it appeared as though the pool

was profitable. Id.

In the course of operating their fraudulent commodity pool, Defendants made
numerous false statements of their experience and expertise in foreign and virtual
currencies like Bitcoin. In October 2018, Defendants told a prospective pool
participant that Defendants employed a “master team of traders [who could] execute
the Foreign Exchange markets with precision and accuracy.” Id. at { 25. Earlier that
year, Defendants posted on Facebook that in “investing in Venture you could yield
[a] 12-16% [return] per month.” Id. Other times they promised an “18% weekly”
return on “crypto investments” and as much as a “21%” return on investment from
Venture Capital. Id. In reality, Clark had little to no trading experience, Venture
Capital had no team of highly experienced traders, and the pool money actually

traded by Venture Capital and Ms. Clark was lost. Id. at {{] 27-30.

Defendants misrepresented the risk of investing in cryptocurrency to pool
participants. In April 2018, Defendants told prospective pool members that, if they
joined the pool, they would receive a “capital lock,” which would ensure the capital
they invested would be protected from loss. Id. at | 32. Defendants reiterated this

misrepresentation to potential pool participants in October 2018. Id.

Defendants’ misrepresentations were successful—a total of seventytwo pool
participants sent $534,829 to Defendants’ bank accounts. Id. at {| 35. Of this,
Defendants invested $121,165 in cryptocurrency trades that lost approximately
$84,000. Id. at { 36. With the remaining $450,302, Ms. Clark purchased a car,

jewelry, and other personal items, and made payments to pool members so it
Case 1:20-cy-00882-DDD-MEH OGocument30 Filed 11/02/20 USOC Colorada Page 3 of 14

appeared as though the commodity pool was profitable. Id. at {| 37. Defendants’
concealed their scheme by sending out falsified account statements that showed
trading gains. Id. at {| 38. One of these account statements reported a 67-percent
return over a fourteen-week period. Id. Another account statement showed a 26-
percent return over the last month. Id. When several pool participants requested to
withdraw their funds, Ms. Clark falsely told them that an ongoing “CFTC audit”

prevented her from permitting withdrawal. Id. at J 41.

After investigation, the Commission filed this suit against Venture Capital and
Ms. Clark on February 14, 2020, asserting four claims under the Commodity

Exchange Act:

(1) fraud by a community pool operator or community trade advisor in violation

of 7 U.S.C. § 60(1);
(2) fraud by deceptive device in violation of 7 U.S.C. § 9(1);

(3) failure to register as a community pool operator in violation of 7
U.S.C. § 6(m)(1) and provisions implementing regulation, 17
C.F.R. § 5.3 (a)(2)(i); and

(4) failure to register as a community trade advisor in violation of 7
U.S.C. § 6m(1) and that provision’s implementing regulation, 17
C.E.R. § 5.3(a)(3)(i).

Doc. 1. On February 18, 2020, Venture Capital and Ms. Clark were served with the
summons and the complaint. Docs. 6, 8, 10. Venture Capital’s service agent was
served on February 28, 2020. Doc. 7. Despite being served, Venture Capital and
Ms. Clark did not answer or otherwise respond to the complaint, so the Commission
moved the clerk of court for an entry of default against the Defendants. Doc. 12.
The clerk entered default against Ms. Clark on March 17, 2020, and against Venture
Capital on March 23, 2020. Docs. 13, 21. The Commission then moved for the now-

pending motion for entry of default judgment. Doc.

ANALYSIS

Under Rule 55(b), after the clerk enters default, a court must enter a default
judgment against a party that has failed to plead or otherwise defend an action
brought against it. Default judgment may be entered by the clerk if the claim is for
a “sum certain,” Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(b)(1), but in all other cases, “the party must
apply to the court for a default judgment.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(b)(2). The purpose of
a default judgment is to protect a diligent party against an unresponsive adversary.

In re Rains, 946 F.2d 731, 732-33 (10th Cir. 1991).

1. Jurisdiction

Before a court can enter default judgment it must ensure it has jurisdiction over
the matter. Dennis Garberg & Assocs., Inc. v. Pack-Tech Int’! Corp., 115 F.3d 767,
771 (10th Cir. 1997). The Court has subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §
1331, which grants jurisdiction to federal courts over questions “arising under”
federal law, and 28 U.S.C. § 1345, which grants federal district courts jurisdiction
over civil suits “commenced by the United States.” All of the Commission’s claims
are asserted under federal statutes or regulations, and this is a civil suit filed by the

United States.

The Court also has personal jurisdiction over Defendants. The moving party
bears the burden of proof to show that the Court has jurisdiction over Defendants
under Colorado’s long-arm statute and that they have minimum contacts with the
state. Dennis, 115 F.3d at 771. But in the context of a motion for default judgment,
the petitioner’s burden is a minimal one: the petitioner “need only make a prima
facie showing on these two questions if the motion is decided only on the basis the
parties’ affidavits and other written materials,” as it is here. Id.; see also Fed.

Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Oaklawn Apartments, 959 F.2d 170, 174 (10th Cir. 1992)
Case 1:20-cy-O0882-DDD-MEH Bocument 30 Filed 11/02/20 USDC Colorada Page 5 af 14

(explaining that well-pleaded allegations in complaint are accepted as true for

purposes of determining personal jurisdiction at pleading stage).

The complaint satisfies this standard. It alleges that Ms. Clark is a resident of
Colorado and that she is the control-person of Venture Capital which is also located
and incorporated in Colorado. Doc. 1| at §{[ 11— 12. This is sufficient for the Court
to exercise general personal jurisdiction over a defendant. Daimler AG v. Bauman,
571 U.S. 117, 137 (2014) (“With respect to a corporation, the place of incorporation
and principal place of business are paradigm bases for general jurisdiction.”
(alterations adopted; citations omitted)); Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.A.
v. Brown, 564 U.S. 915, 924 (2011) (“For an individual, the paradigm forum for

the exercise of general jurisdiction is the individual’s domicile.”’).

Il. Entry of Default Judgment

Having assured it has jurisdiction over this matter, the court must decide “whether
the unchallenged facts constitute a legitimate cause of action” such that a judgment
should be entered. Bixler v. Foster, 596 F.3d 751, 762 (10th Cir. 2010) (quoting
10A Charles A. Wright, Arthur

R. Miller & Mary K. Kane, Fed. Prac. & Proc. § 2688, at 63 (3d ed. 1998)). “There
must be a sufficient basis in the pleadings for the judgment entered.” Id. (quoting
Nishimatsu Constr. Co. v. Houston Nat’] Bank, 515 F.2d 1200, 1206 (5th Cir.
1975)). “A party is not entitled to a default judgment as of right; rather the entry of
a default judgment is entrusted to the ‘sound judicial discretion’ of the court.”
Greenwich Ins. Co. v. Daniel Law Firm, No. 07-cv-2445- LTB-MJW, 2008 WL
793606, at *2 (D. Colo. Mar. 22, 2008) (quoting Cablevision of S. Conn., Ltd.
P’ship v. Smith, 141 F. Supp. 2d 277, 281 (D. Conn. 2001)).

On review of a motion for default judgment, if default was properly entered, the
moving party enjoys the benefit of deferential pleading interpretation. See Olcott v.
Del. Flood Co., 327 F.3d 1115, 1125 (10th Cir. 2003). The court deems the well-
pleaded facts of the complaint to be true. Vibe Tech., LLC v. Suddath, No. 06-cv-

Howard Pipe & Concrete Prods., Inc., 722 F.2d 1319, 1323 (7th Cir. 1983)).
Undisputed facts set forth by the moving party in affidavits and exhibits are also

accepted as true. Id.

A. Count I: Fraud by a community pool operator or community trade
advisor in violation of 7 U.S.C. § 60(1)

7 U.S.C. § 60(1), makes it unlawful for a commodity trading advisor,
associated person of a commodity trading advisor, commodity pool
operator, or associated person of a commodity pool operator, by use
of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce,

directly or indirectly--

(A) — to employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud
any client or participant or prospective client or participant; or

(B) to engage in any transaction, practice, or course of
business which operates as a fraud or deceit upon any client or
participant or prospective client or participant.

Id. To be entitled to a default judgment, the undisputed facts must show that (1)
Defendants were commodity trading advisors, commodity pool operators, or
persons associated with them; (2) used an instrumentality of interstate commerce;
(3) to make material misrepresentations; (4) with scienter; (5) in connection with
the purchase or sale of a commodity. U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Comm’n v.
Wilson, 19 F. Supp. 3d 352, 363 (D. Mass. 2014) (“The same intentional or reckless
misappropriations, misrepresentations, and omissions of material fact violative of
section [6]b of the Act ... also violate section [6]o(1)(A)-(B) of the Act.” (quoting
CFTC v. Driver, 877 F.Supp.2d 968, 978 (C.D. Cal. 2012)), aff'd sub nom.
Commodity Futures Trading Comm’n v. JBW Capital, 812 F.3d 98 (1st Cir. 2016);
see also Stotler & Co. v. Commodity Futures Trading Comm’n, 855 F.2d 1288,
1291 (7th Cir. 1988) (“Section 40 is a parallel statute forbidding fraud and

misrepresentation by commodity trading advisors.”). Each element is present here.
Case 1:20-cy-O0882-DDD-MEH Bocument 30 Filed 11/02/20 USDC Colorada Page ? af i4

The undisputed facts show Ms. Clark meets the definition of “commodity trading
advisor.” A commodity trading advisor is a person who “for compensation or profit,
engages in the business of advising others, either directly or through publications,
writings, or electronic media, as to the value of or the advisability of trading in”
commodities. 7 U.S.C. § 1a(12)(A). Notably, a person need not be registered as a
commodity trading advisor with the commission to be considered a commodity
trading advisor. Id. It is undisputed that advised pool members directly and
indirectly in the purchase and sale of foreign and virtual currencies. She thus acted
as a commodity trading advisor.

The undisputed facts likewise show that Venture Capital meets the definition of
“commodity pool operator.” A “commodity pool operator” is a person “engaged in
a business that is of the nature of a commodity pool, investment trust, syndicate, or
similar form of enterprise, and who, in connection therewith, solicits, accepts, or
receives from others, funds, securities, or property . . . for the purpose of trading in
commodity interests.” 7 U.S.C. § la(11)(A). Notably, a person need not be
registered as a commodity pool operator with the Commission to be considered a
commodity pool operator. Id. Here, it is undisputed that Venture Capital operated
a commodity pool whose purpose was to trade foreign currency and virtual
currencies. This element is thus satisfied.

The remaining elements are also present. Defendants used instrumentalities of
interstate commerce to accomplish their scheme— namely, email and social media.
See Utah Lighthouse Ministry v. Found. for Apologetic Info. & Research, 527 F.3d
1045, 1054 (10th Cir. 2008) (“We agree that the Internet is generally an
instrumentality of interstate commerce.”). They engaged in fraudulent conduct in
relation to the sale of commodities. Among other things, Defendants (1)
misrepresented their expertise and experience in trading foreign and virtual
currencies; (2) misappropriated pool participants’ funds; and (3) created false
account statements it distributed to plan participants. This kind of conduct violates
the Section 60 of the Commodity Exchange Act. Commodity Futures Trading
Comm’n v. Schafer, No. CIV.A. H-96-1213, 1997 WL 33547409, at *8 (S.D. Tex.

-7-
Case 1:20-cy-O0882-DDD-MEH Bocument 30 Filed 11/02/20 USDC Colorada Page 8 af 14

Dec. 23, 1997) (“Accordingly, it is generally well-understood that providing false
or misleading account statements or misrepresenting other material facts constitutes
fraud under Section

4o of the CEA.” (citing Commodity Futures Trading Comm’n v.
Schroeder, Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) J 22, 394 at 29,805 (D. Kan. Sept.

28, 1984)); see also U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Comm’n v. Driver, 877 F.
Supp. 2d 968, 978 (C.D. Cal. 2012) (“Actionable misrepresentations include those
made to customers when soliciting their funds.”), aff'd sub nom. Commodity
Futures Trading Comm’n v. Driver, 585 F. App’x 366 (9th Cir. 2014).

The undisputed facts thus demonstrate that Defendants violated 7 U.S.C. § 60.

B. Count II: Fraud by deceptive device in violation of 7 U.S.C. § 9(1)
and 17 C.F.R. § 180.1(a)

In Count IT, the Commission alleges that Defendants violated 7

U.S.C. § 9(1), and 17 C.F.R. § 180.1(a) by fraudulently deceiving pool members.
Under 7 U.S.C. § 9(1), it is unlawful for any person to

use or employ, or attempt to use or employ, in connection with any
swap, or acontract of sale of any commodity in interstate commerce,
or for future delivery on or subject to the rules of any registered
entity, any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance, in
contravention of such rules and regulations as the Commission shall
promulgate.

And as pertinent here, 17 C.F.R. § 180.1(a) makes it

unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, in connection with
any swap, or contract of sale of any commodity in interstate
commerce, or contract for future delivery on or subject to the rules
of any registered entity, to intentionally or recklessly use or employ,
or attempt to use or employ, any manipulative device, scheme, or
artifice to defraud; make, or attempt to make, any untrue or
misleading statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material
fact necessary in order to make the statements made not untrue or
misleading; or engage, or attempt to engage, in any act, practice, or
course of business, which operates or would operate as a fraud or
deceit upon any person.
Case 1:20-cy-O0882-DDD-MEH Bocument 30 Filed 11/02/20 USDC Colorada Page 9 af i4

“To prove a violation of ...7 U.S.C. § 9(1)[] and Regulation 180.1(a), 17

C.F.R. § 180.1(a) .. . , the Commission must show that Defendants engaged in
prohibited conduct (ie., employed a fraudulent scheme; made a material
misrepresentation, misleading statement[,] or deceptive omission; or engaged in a
business practice that operated as a fraud); with scienter; and in connection with a
contract of sale of a commodity in interstate commerce.” Commodity Futures
Trading Comm’n v. McDonnell, 332 F. Supp. 3d 641, 717 (E.D.N.Y. 2018) (citing
See CFTC

v. McDonnell, 287 F.Supp.3d 213, 226 (E.D.N.Y. 2018); CFTC v. S. Tr. Metals,
Inc., 894 F.3d 1313, 1325 (11th Cir. 2018); CFTC v. Hunter Wise Commodities,
LLC, 21 F.Supp.3d 1317, 1347 (S.D. Fla. 2014)). Here, the undisputed facts

establish each element.

The facts show that Defendants used a deceptive device or contrivance in
connection with the sale of a commodity in interstate commerce by
misappropriating pool-member funds to purchase electronic currencies like Bitcoin.
See McDonnell, 332 F.Supp.3d at 717-19, 723 (finding defendant violated 7 U.S.C.
§ 91) and 17 C.F.R. § 180.1(a) by misappropriating funds and making
misrepresentations); see also Commodity Futures Trading Comm’n v. My Big Coin
Pay, Inc., 334 F. Supp. 3d 492, 498 (D. Mass. 2018) (collecting cases and noting
that bitcoin is a commodity within the meaning of 9 U.S.C. § 9(1)). As described
above, Defendants likewise misrepresented their expertise in trading electronic
currencies, misappropriated pool participant funds, and lied about the profitability
of the pool. And the facts show that they acted with scienter. They knew, for
example, that the account statements they issued were false. The undisputed facts

establish a violation of Section 9(1).

C. Counts III and IV: Failure to register as a commodity pool operator
or a commodity trade advisor in violation of 7 U.S.C. § 6(m)(1), and
17 C_F.R. §§ 5.3 (a)(2)(i) and 5.3(a)(3)(@)
Case 1:20-cvy-O0882-DDD-MEH Bocument 30 Filed 11/02/20 USDC Colorada Page 10 of 14

7 U.S.C. § 6m(1) makes it unlawful for any Commodity Pool Operator or
Commodity Trade Advisor to make use of the mails or any means or instrumentality
of interstate commerce in connection with its business unless it is registered with
the Commission. Count three of the complaint alleges that Ms. Clark and Venture
Capital operated as an unregistered Commodity Pool Operators. And Count Four
of the Complaint alleges that Ms. Clark operated as an unregistered Commodity

Trade Advisor. The Commission is entitled to default judgment on these claims.

17 C.F.R. § 5.3(a)(2)() makes it unlawful for any Commodity Pool Operator
engaged in retail foreign-exchange transactions defined in 17 C.F.R. § 5.1(d)(1), to
act as a Commodity Pool Operator without being registered. As pertinent here, 17
C.F.R. § 5.1(d)(1) defines a Commodity Pool Operator as “any person who operates
or solicits funds, securities, or property for a pooled investment vehicle . . . that
engages in retail forex transactions.” The undisputed facts show that from March 1
to April 2, 2018 and again from October 17, 2018 to June 30, 2019, Ms. Clark acted
as aCommodity Pool Operator by soliciting funds for the pool and trading the funds
in the pool. Compl. at §{[ 18-20, 24. Venture Capital performed the same function
from April 3, 2018 to October 17, 2018, VCI acted as a CPO. Id. at Jf 20, 22.

17 C.F.R. § 5.3(a)(3)G) makes it unlawful for any Commodity Trade Adviser
engaged in foreign-exchange transactions to do so without being registered with the
Commission. As explained above, Ms. Clark meets the definition of Commodity
Trading Advisor and she wasn’t registered as such with the Commission. Compl.
at { 49. The undisputed facts thus establish that the Commission is entitled to a

default judgment on Counts Three and Four of the Complaint.
Ii. Entitlement to Relief

Even if a plaintiff has a legal basis for relief, a default judgment cannot be entered
until the amount of damages or the entitlement to injunctive relief has been
ascertained. See Herzfeld v. Parker, 100 F.R.D. 770,773 (D. Colo. 1984). Pursuant

to Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(c), “[a] default judgment must not differ in kind from, or

-10-
Case 1:20-cy-O0882-DDD-MEH Bocument 30 Filed 11/02/20 USDC Colorada Page li of 14

exceed in amount, what is demanded in the pleadings.” The Commission seeks (1)

an injunction; (2) restitution; (3) a civil monetary penalty; and (4) costs.

A. Injunctive Relief

7 U.S.C. § 13a-1(a) empowers the court to enter an injunction in an action brought
by the Commission. Id. (“Whenever it shall appear to the Commission that any
person has engaged [in activity] constituting a violation of any provision of this
chapter or any rule thereunder the Commission may bring an action to enjoin such
act’) (internal omissions and ellipses omitted); see also 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1(b)(“* Upon
a proper showing, a permanent or temporary injunction or restraining order shall be
granted without bond.”). “An injunction prohibiting a party from engaging in
conduct that violates the provisions of a statute is appropriate when there is a
likelihood that, unless enjoined, the violations will continue.” Commodity Futures
Trading Comm’n v. Am. Bd. of Trade, Inc., 803 F.2d 1242, 1250-51 (2d Cir. 1986)
(citing CFTC v. Co Petro Marketing Group, Inc., 680 F.2d 573, 582 n. 16 (9th
Cir.1982); SEC v. Holschuh, 694 F.2d 130, 144-45 (7th Cir. 1982)). “The
traditional requirements for injunctive relief such as irreparable injury or
inadequacy of other remedies are not required under § 13a—1, and the Commission
need only show a likelihood of a violation.” Commodity Futures Trading Comm’n
v. Clothier, 788 F. Supp. 490, 492-93 (D. Kan. 1992) (citations omitted). A district
court may properly infer a likelihood of future violations from the defendant’s past

unlawful conduct.” Am. Bd. of Trade, Inc., 803 F.2d at 1250-51.

Under these standards, the Commission is entitled to an injunction. Defendants
have committed fraud in connection with the operation of a commodity pool and
have illegally operated an unregistered commodity pool, which is sufficient for the

court to infer future illegal conduct along these lines.

B. Restitution

-ll-
Case 1:20-cvy-O0882-DDD-MEH Document 30 Filed 11/02/20 USDC Colorada Page 12 of 14

The court is empowered to award of restitution under the Commodity Exchange
Act. 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1(d)(3) (“In any action brought under this section, the
Commission may seek, and the court may impose, on a proper showing, on any
person found in the action to have committed any violation, equitable remedies
including restitution to persons who have sustained losses proximately caused by
such violation (in the amount of such losses).”); see also Commodity Futures
Trading Comm’n v. Kimberlynn Creek Ranch, Inc., 276 F.3d 187, 193 (4th Cir.
2002) (“It is well settled that equitable remedies such as disgorgement are available
to remedy violations of the CEA.”). “Generally, the amount of restitution in FTC
consumer redress cases is the purchase price of the relevant product or business
opportunity, less any refunds or money earned.” F.T.C. v. Nat’] Bus. Consultants,

Inc., 781 F. Supp. 1136, 1143 (E.D. La. 1991).

Based on the foregoing conduct of Defendants, the court will order restitution in
the amount of $450,302, entailing deposits Defendants received ($534,829), less

the amount Defendants repaid to their customers ($84,527).
C. Civil Monetary Penalty

The court is empowered to impose a civil monetary penalty under the Act
“an the amount of not more than the greater of $100,000 or triple the monetary gain
to the person for each violation.” 7 U.S.C. § 13al(d)(1)(A). The Commission
Regulations adjust the statutory civil monetary penalty of $100,000 for inflation. 17
C.F.R. § 143.8. For the period at issue here, the statutory civil monetary penalty is
$185,242 for each violation. Id. “Civil penalties should be imposed to act as a
deterrent, but should be proportional to the gravity of the offenses committed.”
Commodity Futures Trading Comm’n v. Brockbank, 505 F. Supp. 2d 1169, 1177
(D. Utah 2007), aff'd, 316 F. App’x 707 (10th Cir. 2008). While the Commission
requests the maximum possible penalty—three times the amount Defendants gained
for the conduct, or $1,350,906— the court deems this amount excessive in the light

of its order for the Defendants to pay restitution. The court will order a civil

-12-
Case 1:20-cy-O0882-DDD-MEH Document 30 Filed 11/02/20 USDC Colorada Page 13 of 14

monetary penalty in the amount of the gain Defendants received, or $450,302.! This

amount is in addition to the restitution discussed above.

CONLCUSION
The Commission’s motion for entry of default judgment (Doc. 29) is
GRANTED, and the clerk is directed to enter default judgment against
Defendants in the principal sum of $900,604 and costs. It is FURTHER
ORDERED that Defendants, their officers, agents, servants,

 

employees, and attorneys, and any other persons who are in active concert or

participation with them are permanently enjoined from engaging in:

A. further violations of 7 U.S.C. 8§ 60(1)(A), (B), 6m(1), 9(1); and
17 C.F.R. §§ 5.3(a)(2), (3), 180.1(a);

B. entering into any transactions involving “commodity interests,” 17
C.F.R. § 1.3, for their own personal account or for any account in which

they, separately or together, have a direct or indirect interest;

C. having any commodity futures, options on commodity futures,
commodity options, security futures products, swaps, and/or forex

contracts traded on their behalf, either separately or together;

D. controlling or directing the trading for or on behalf of any other person
