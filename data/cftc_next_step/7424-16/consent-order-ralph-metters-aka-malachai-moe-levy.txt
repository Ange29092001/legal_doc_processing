THE PARTIES AGREE AND THE COURT HEREBY FINDS:
A. _ Findings of Fact

The Parties to this Consent Order

14. Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an independent
federal regulatory agency that is charged by Congress with administering and
enforcing the Act, 7 U.S.C. §§ 1-26 (2012), and the Regulations promulgated
thereunder, 17 C.F.R. §§ 1.1 — 190.10 (2014).

15. Ralph Metters, aka Malachai “Moe” Levy, resides in Los Angeles,
California. Metters has never been registered with the Commission in any
capacity.

Defendant’s Activities

16. Beginning in or before 2011, and continuing through at least October,
2014, there was an agreement between more than two persons to commit wire
fraud. Defendant became a member of the conspiracy knowing of its object and
intending to help accomplish it.

17. In furtherance of the conspiracy, Defendant falsely represented to
investors that he would use their money to engage in foreign currency investments,
and their money would be kept in escrow until they authorized its use. Victims
accordingly invested at least $745,000, which Defendant took out of the escrow
accounts without their permission. Interstate wires used to advance the foreign
currency investment fraud include the wire transfer of $500,000 from a victim’s

B. Conclusions of Law

Jurisdiction and Venue

18. The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 6c of
the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1 (2012), which provides that whenever it shall appear to
the Commission that any person has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in

regulation, or order promulgated thereunder, the Commission may bring an action
in the proper district court of the United States against any such person to enjoin
such act or practice, or to enforce compliance with the Act, or any rule, regulation,
or order thereunder.

19. Venue properly lies with this Court pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the
Act, 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1(e) (2012), because the Defendant resides in this jurisdiction
and the acts and practices in violations of the Act occurred within this District.

Fraud by Misappropriation, Misrepresentation, and Omission

20. By the conduct described in paragraphs | through 17 above, the
Defendant cheated and defrauded, or attempted to cheat and defraud, and willfully
deceived, or attempted to deceive, his client by, among other things, knowingly
(a) misappropriating funds provided by M.B.; and (b) making material
misrepresentations including, but not limited to, guaranteeing trading profits and

24. Defendant’s violations of the Act and Regulations merit the award of

conduct at issue in this action. Accordingly, restitution is not ordered in this
action.
B. Disgorgement

25. Defendant shall pay disgorgement in the amount of five hundred
thousand dollars ($500,000) (“Disgorgement Obligation’), plus post-judgment
