Plaintiff U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“Commission”) alleges as

follows:
I. SUMMARY

1, From at least January 2010 through the present (the “Relevant Period”), Haena
Park, individually and as the founder and officer of Phaetra Capital GP LLC (“Phaetra GP”),
Phaetra Capital Management LP (“Phaetra Management”, and, collectively with Phaetra GP, the
“Phaetra entities”), and Argenta Group LLC (“Argenta Group”, and collectively with Park and
the Phaetra entities, “Pool Defendants”), engaged in at least two fraudulent schemes in violation
of the Commodity Exchange Act (“Act”): (1) the Pool Defendants fraudulently solicited at least
$23 million from members of the public to participate in a commodity pool that traded various
futures contracts, as well as leveraged or margined retail off-exchange foreign currencies, the

latter contracts commonly known as “forex” and (2) Park, as the agent and officer Argenta

 
Case 1:16-cv-04120 Documenti1 Filed 06/02/16 Page 2 of 35

Capital LLC, a predecessor of Phaetra Management, duped at least one investment firm to
authorize Park to manage the firm’s investment account. Moreover, Park and her partner Yul
Kaseman (collectively with Pool Defendants, “Defendants”) made false statements to the
National Futures Association (“NFA”) about the Phaetra entities’ activities.

2. At Park’s direction, approximately 50 members of the public (“pool participants’)
deposited over $23 million into at least 4 bank accounts opened in Park’s name and/or controlled
by Park. In soliciting funds from potential and existing pool participants, Park made material
misrepresentations and omissions regarding her trading expertise and profits.

3. Park told the poo! participants that they were investing in a pooled investment run
by the Phaetra entities and the Argenta Group. In reality, Park transferred a portion of pool
participant funds to a personal trading account opened in Park’s name at futures commission
merchant (“FCM”) Interactive Brokers, where she traded on behalf of a commodity pool (“Park
Pool”).

4, Over the Relevant Period, Park’s trading on behalf of the Park Pool resulted in a
loss of more than $17.5 million. Park hid these losses from the pool participants and falsely and
fraudulently represented to existing and prospective pool participants that the Park Pool was
trading at a profit. To perpetrate her fraud, Park provided pool participants with false monthly
statements with fabricated data.

5. While Park used portions of the funds collected from the pool participants to trade
for the Park Pool, she also misappropriated portions of pool participants’ funds. Over the
Relevant Period, Park used pool participants’ funds on personal credit card bills, cash

withdrawals, and other non-business related expenses not authorized by the pool participants. |
Case 1:16-cv-04120 Documenti Filed 06/02/16 Page 3 of 35

Park further misappropriated the funds from pool participants by paying out Park Pool funds to
other pool participants, in the manner akin to a Ponzi scheme.

6. Park, individually and as the agent of Argenta Capital LLC (“Argenta”), a
predecessor of Phaetra Management, also made material misrepresentations and omissions
regarding her trading expertise, profits, and the track record and performance of the Park Pool to
an investment firm based in Louisville, Kentucky (“Investment Firm A”), in order to
fraudulently induce Investment Firm A to hire Park and Argenta to manage its funds. Kaseman
recommended Park to Investment Firm A and was aware of Park’s and Argenta’s engagement by
Investment Firm A.

7. Park and Kaseman made multiple false or misleading statements to the NFA, the
self-regulatory organization for the U.S. futures industry, in statutorily required reports filed
between January 2014 and the present, and during an Apri! 2016 NFA audit of the Phaetra
entities. Park and Kaseman falsely represented to the NFA that the Phaetra entities had not yet
begun to operate or to solicit business. Park also represented to the NFA that all of the funds in a
trading account maintained in her own name at Interactive Brokers were proprietary in nature
and comprised solely of her own funds. However, Park and Kaseman knew that these statements
to the NFA were false because they knew that Park, on behalf of the Phaetra entities, had
solicited and accepted funds, purportedly for trades, from pool participants during the Relevant
Period.

8. Park and Kaseman also represented to the NFA that neither Argenta Capital GP
LLC nor Argenta Capital LLC, predecessors of the Phaetra entities, ever operated or solicited

business. Park and Kaseman knew that statement to the NFA was false because they knew that
Case 1:16-cv-04120 Documenti Filed 06/02/16 Page 4 of 35

Park, on behalf of Argenta Capital LLC, entered into a Commodity Trading Agreement with
Investment Firm A and managed a fund for Investment Firm A from March 2013 to May 2014.

9. By virtue of this conduct, and as more fully set forth below, Defendants have
engaged, are engaging, and/or are about to engage in acts and practices in violation of provisions
of the Act, 7 U.S.C. §§ 1 et seg. (2012), and certain of the Commission’s Regulations
(“Regulations”) promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. §§ 1.1 et seg. (2015).

10. The acts and omissions of Park and Kaseman occurred within the scope of their
agency, employment, and/or office with the Phaetra entities; therefore, the Phaetra entities are
liable for these acts and omissions pursuant to Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. §
2(a)(1)(B) (2012), and Regulation 1.2, 17 C.F.R. § 1.2 (2015).

11. | Some of Park’s acts and omissions also occurred within the scope of her agency,
employment, and/or office with Argenta Group; therefore, the Argenta Group is liable for these
acts and omissions pursuant to Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 2(a)(1)(B) (2012), and
Regulation 1.2, 17 C.F.R. § 1.2 (2015).

12. During the Relevant Period, Park controlled the Phaetra entities, directly or
indirectly, and did not act in good faith or knowingly induced, directly or indirectly, the acts of
the Phaetra entities described herein; therefore, Park is liable for the acts of the Phaetra entities
pursuant to Section 13(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 13c(b) (2012).

13. Similarly, during the Relevant Period, Park controlled Argenta Group, directly or
indirectly, and did not act in good faith or knowingly induced, directly or indirectly, the acts of
Argenta Group described herein; therefore, Park is liable for the acts of Argenta Group pursuant

to Section 13(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 13c(b) (2012).
Case 1:16-cv-04120 Document1 Filed 06/02/16 Page 5 of 35

14. Accordingly, pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, as amended, 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1
(2012), the Commission brings this action to enjoin Defendants’ unlawful acts and practices and
to compel compliance with the Act, as amended, and Commission Regulations.

15. — In addition, the Commission seeks civil monetary penalties and remedial ancillary
relief, including, but not limited to, trading and registration bans, restitution, disgorgement,
rescission, pre- and post-judgment interest, and such other relief as the Court may deem
necessary and appropriate.

16. Unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, Defendants are likely to continue to
engage in the acts and practices alleged in this Complaint or in similar acts and practices, as
described more fully below.

Il. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

17. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 6c(a) of the Act,
7 U.S.C. § 13a-1 (2012), which authorizes the Commission to seek injunctive and other relief
against any person whenever it appears to the Commission that such person has engaged, is
engaging, or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a violation of any provision of
the Act or any rule, regulation, or order thereunder.

18. Venue lies properly in this District pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
§ 13a-1(e) (2012), because the Defendants transacted business in the Southern District of New
York, and some of the Defendants’ acts and practices in violation of the Act and Regulations
occurred within this District.

V. FACTS

A. Operation of the Park Pool

 

26. Park first opened a personal trading account at Interactive Brokers (“IB Trading
Account”) in November 2008. Beginning in January 2010, Park began soliciting funds from
prospective pool participants and induced pool participants to transfer funds via wire into bank
accounts in her own name and in the name of Argenta Group LLC. By May 31, 2016,
approximately 50 pool participants had transferred more than $23 million to bank accounts
controlled by Park. Park had transferred approximately $21.5 million to the IB Trading Account, .
and misappropriated the remainder of the funds.

27. During the Relevant Period, the Park Pool consistently suffered heavy losses
through Park’s trading. The pool declined in value in 74 out of the 91 months it had operated,
and suffered a cumulative loss of approximately $19.4 million, or 99% of the value of the pool.

On May 31, 2016, the total value of the Park Pool had declined to approximately $196,000.
Case 1:16-cv-04120 Document1 Filed 06/02/16 Page 9 of 35

28. At Park’s instruction, pool participants wired funds directly to personal bank
accounts held in Park’s name at Bank of America, J.P. Morgan and Citibank (collectively, “Park
Personal Bank Accounts”), as well as an account at Citibank held in the name of Argenta Group
LLC controlled by Park (“Argenta Bank Account”). Park transferred approximately $19 million
of the $23 million wired by the pool participants into the IB Trading Account. She
misappropriated the rest of the funds, or approximately $4 million. The funds transferred to the
IB Trading Account were used to effect futures and forex transactions. Park also withdrew a
total of approximately $1.8 million.

29. At all relevant times, Park was the sole signatory on the Park Personal Bank
Accounts and the Argenta Bank Account. She was also the sole person authorized to trade in the
IB Trading Account. Accordingly, at all relevant times Park had personal knowledge of the total
amount of funds accepted by the pool from participants, the disposition of those funds, as well as
the number of trades effected on behalf of pool participants in the Park Pool and the date each
trade was made. As reflected in the daily activity statements for the IB Trading Account, Park
actively traded commodity futures and forex each month throughout the Relevant Period.

B. Material Misrepresentations to Pool Participants

30. During the Relevant Period, Park made material misrepresentations and omissions
regarding her trading expertise, profits, and the track record and performance of the Park Pool
when soliciting funds from prospective pool participants. Park knowingly made
misrepresentations and omissions in order to fraudulently induce prospective pool participants to
deposit, maintain, or increase their deposits in the Park Pool.

31. Park represented to prospective pool participants that they were investing in a

pooled “friends and family” fund run by the Phaetra entities or its predecessors, rather than an
Case 1:16-cv-04120 Document1 Filed 06/02/16 Page 10 of 35

commodity pool run out of the IB Trading Account. When Park made solicitations from
prospective pool participants, she furnished them with charts purporting to contain actual
performance data over the preceding months. In truth, the charts contained fabricated data that
bore no relationship or resemblance to reality. At all relevant times, the Park Pool suffered
heavy losses and declined steeply in value due to Park’s trading. Park never disclosed these
losses to the prospective and existing pool participants.

32. For example, in April 2015, Park solicited funds from a prospective pool
participant J.A., who resided in Baltimore, Maryland. During this solicitation, Park knowingly
made false and fraudulent representations about the performance and track records of the Park
Pool.

33. On or about April 2, 2015, Park emailed J.A. a document titled “Returns.pdf’,
which Park represented showed the actual performance of an investment of $1,000,000 made in
November 2009 under her management. The document falsely represented that, under Park’s
management, the initial investment of $1,000,000 achieved a cumulative return of 393.2% and
grew to $4,778,229 by February 27, 2015. The chart also falsely showed that, in the 64-month
period between November 2009 and February 2015, the purported investment suffered a loss in
value in only four of the 64 months, and experienced growth between 0.2 % to 8.4% per month
in 60 of the 64 months.

34. _Intruth, contrary to Park’s representations, between November 2009 and
February 2015, the Park Pool had lost approximately $10.13 million as a result of Park’s trading
activities, and suffered losses in value in 48 out of the 64 preceding months. In August 2011,
where Park claimed to have enjoyed the highest monthly gain of 8.4% in the value of her

investments, her trading actually resulted in a loss of $256,686 to the Park Pool, or a loss of over

-10-
Case 1:16-cv-04120 Document1 Filed 06/02/16 Page 11 of 35

88% of the total value of the pool for that month. Park knew or should have known that these
representations regarding the track record and performance of the Park Pool were false because
she was the sole person in control of and responsible for the JB Trading Account and the Park
Pool at all relevant times. Park made these misrepresentations in order to fraudulently induce
J.A. to invest in the Park Pool.

35. On or about April 1, 2015, Park induced J.A. to execute an “Agreement of
Investment”. The parties to the “Agreement of Investment” were J.A. and Park, as agent of
Phaetra Capital Management LP, which Park represented to be the successor-in-interest to
Argenta Capital LLC. The “Agreement of Investment” provided that J.A. would make an initial
investment of $700,000. The “Agreement of Investment” further falsely and fraudulently
represented the following:

a). Park’s and Phaetra Management’s fees would be limited to an annual fee of 2% of the
principal, to be applied at the beginning of each fiscal year, and 10% of the annual
performance, to be applied at the end of each fiscal year;

b). J.A.’s investment would be tracked by Park, and Park would send to J.A. a monthly
statement showing monthly and year-to-date gains and losses on the principal
invested; and

c). Upon a notification of withdrawal by J.A., positions would be liquidated from the
brokerage account by the end of the month and the resulting capital would be sent to
J.A.

36. — Based on Park’s fraudulent representations, J.A. made an initial investment of

$700,000 and transferred the funds to Park via wire on or about April 2, 2015. Subsequently,

between May 15, 2015 and September 18, 2015, J.A. made three additional investments totaling

-{1-
Case 1:16-cv-04120 Document1 Filed 06/02/16 Page 12 of 35

$3.3 million. Each time J.A. re-invested, he and Park executed a new Agreement of Investment
containing similar, and similarly fraudulent, language. Park transferred a portion of J.A.’s
investment funds to the IB Trading Account and misappropriated the rest.

37. As another example, on or about January 4, 2016, Park solicited funds from a
prospective pool participant A.D., who resided in London, United Kingdom, to participate in the
Park Pool. During this solicitation, Park made false and fraudulent representations about the
performance and track record of the Park Pool.

38.  Onor about January 6, 2016, Park and A.D. spoke on the phone regarding the
possibility of investing in the Park Pool. After the call, Park emailed A.D. a document titled
“Returns.pdf’. In her email to A.D., Park referred to the “Returns.pdf’ document as
“performance data” and asked A.D. to keep the data confidential. The “Returns.pdf’ document,
similar to the document received by J.A. described above, consisted of a chart purporting to
show the actual performance of an investment of $1,000,000 made in November 2009. The
document falsely represented that, under Park’s management, an initial investment of $1,000,000
in November 2009 obtained a cumulative return of 514.2% and grew to $6,142,448 by December
31, 2015. The chart also purported to show that, in the 74-month period between November
2009 and December 2015, the investment suffered a loss in value in only four of the 74 months,
and experienced monthly growth between 0.2 % to 8.4% in 70 of the 64 months.

39. In truth, and contrary to Park’s representations, by December 2015, the Park Pool
had lost over $16.34 million as a result of Park’s trading activities. In the 74-month period
between January 2009 and December 2015, the Park Pool lost value in 60 out of 74 months.
Park knew or should have known that her representations regarding the track record and

performance of the Park Pool were false because she was the sole person in control of and

-12-
Case 1:16-cv-04120 Document1 Filed 06/02/16 Page 13 of 35

responsible for the IB Trading Account and the Park Pool at all relevant times. Park made these
misrepresentations in order to fraudulently induce A.D. to invest in the Park Pool.

40. Based on Park’s fraudulent representations and omissions, A.D. decided to invest
in the Park Pool and transferred $800,000 to Park via wire on or about January 11 and 13, 2016.
A.D. also introduced his parents, R.D. and L.D., who resided in Edison, New Jersey, to Park. In
January and April 2016, R.D. and L.D. made two investments totaling $850,000 in the Park Pool.
Park transferred a portion of these investment funds to the IB Trading Account and
misappropriated the rest.

41. During the Relevant Period, Park, individually and as agent of the Phaetra
entities, both orally and in writing, falsely represented to pool participants that their share of the
Park Pool had increased in value due to successfully trading, when in fact the value of the Park
Pool had suffered heavy trading losses. During the Relevant Period, Park failed to disclose that
the Park Pool had only 17 winning months out of 91 months, and suffered a cumulative loss of
nearly $19.4 million. On May 31, 2016, the total value of the Park Pool had declined to
approximately $196,000.

42. Park hid these losses from poo! participants. Park knowingly misrepresented to
pool participants on multiple occasions that their total principal investment was intact and that
trading was profitable, when Park knew this was not true. Park knowingly issued false account
statements to pool participants reporting profitable earnings in the pool, when she knew that
there were no such profitable earnings, and that there was instead an overall significant decrease
in the net value of the pool due to the combined effect of trading losses, Park’s misappropriation,
and payments to some pool participants in the manner akin to a Ponzi scheme. In addition, Park

omitted to tell prospective and existing pool participants (a) that she was presently losing money

-13-
Case 1:16-cv-04120 Documenti1 Filed 06/02/16 Page 14 of 35

trading commodities and futures and had consistently lost money trading commodities and
futures in the past; (b) that she traded only a portion of pool participant funds and
misappropriated the remainder.

43, For example, from April 2015 to the present, Park provided J.A. with false and
fraudulent monthly statements, which contained fictitious data on the performance of J.A.’s
investments. These monthly statements falsely state that the value of J.A.’s investment increased
to $5,103,622 by April 29, 2015, or a cumulative return of 35.7% in value. According to these
false statements, J.A.’s investment had increased in value in each of the twelve months, with a
monthly return ranging from 0.9% to 4.7%. In truth, during the same period, the Park Pool had
lost value in each of the preceding twelve months and suffered a cumulative loss of
approximately $7 million.

44, Based on Park’s misrepresentations and omissions of the value and performance
of J.A.’s investments, J.A. made additional deposits in the Park Pool after his initial investment
and continued to maintain his investment with the Park Pool.

45. Similarly, from January 2016 to the present, Park sent to A.D. via email four false
and fraudulent monthly statements that contained fictitious data on the performance of A.D.’s
investments. These monthly statements falsely stated that the value of A.D.’s $800,000
investment had increased to $863,397 by April 29, 2015, which was a cumulative return rate of
8.8% in value. On or about April 4, 2016, Park stated in an email to A.D. that “[w]e had a very
good month”. As recently as May 5, 2016, Park stated in an email to A.D that “[w]e had a good
month”. In truth, during the same period, the Park Pool lost value every month and suffered a

cumulative loss of approximately $2 million and Park failed to disclose these facts.

-14-
Case 1:16-cv-04120 Documenti Filed 06/02/16 Page 15 of 35

46. Based on Park’s misrepresentations and omissions regarding the value and
performance of A.D.’s investments, A.D. continued to maintain his investment with the Park
Pool.

C. Pool Defendants Made Material Misrepresentations to Investment Firm A

47, Park, individually and as the agent of Argenta Capital LLC (“Argenta”), also
made material misrepresentations and omissions regarding her trading expertise, profits, and the
track record and performance of the Park Pool to employees and officers of “Investment Firm
A”, an investment firm based in Louisville, Kentucky. Park knowingly made misrepresentations
in order to fraudulently induce Investment Firm A to hire herself and Argenta to manage
Investment Firm A’s funds as a CTA.

48. In December 2012, Kaseman introduced and recommended Park to J.F., then an
employee at Investment Firm A. On or about December 11, 2012, on an introductory call with
J.F., Park falsely and fraudulently represented that she had been managing about $5 million of
her own money at the time, that her own investments had a “30-35% annualized return” since
2010, and that her biggest monthly “drawdown”, or a decline in the value of her investment, had
been only 2.5%.

49, — J.F. subsequently visited Park’s apartment in New York on or about January 10,
2013, and further discussed Park’s credentials, track record, and trading strategy. At this
meeting, Park falsely and fraudulently represented that she was currently trading $4.5 million of
personal funds and “friends and family” money in commodity futures and forex accounts. Park
also falsely represented that she had begun investing with $1 million of her own money in 2009,

and had grown her initial investment to $3 million by January 2013.

-15-
Case 1:16-cv-04120 Document1 Filed 06/02/16 Page 16 of 35

50. In truth, and contrary to Park’s misrepresentations, at the beginning of December
2012, the value of the positions in Park’s IB Trading Account totaled only approximately
$868,852. By the end of December 2012, due to trading losses, the value in the IB Trading
Account further declined to $253,478 despite a deposit of $149,000 that month, and to $164,488
by the end of January 2013. Moreover, by month-end January 2013, rather than enjoying a 30-
35% annualized return, Park had instead suffered cumulative losses of approximately $4.96
million in value from the approximately $5.13 million in net deposits in the IB trading account.
Park failed to disclose these facts. Park knew that her representations regarding the track record
and performance of her own trading and investments were false because she was the sole person
in control of and responsible for the IB Trading Account and the Park Pool. Park made these
misrepresentations in order to fraudulently induce Investment Firm A to hire her and Argenta to
manage Investment Firm A’s funds.

51. As aresult of Park’s misrepresentations and omissions, on or about February 22,
2013, Investment Firm A entered into a Trading Advisor Agreement with Park, as the agent and
manager of Argenta, to manage a fund (“Master Fund”) for the firm. Subsequently, Investment
Firm A granted to Park and Argenta the authority to trade $5 million on behalf the Master Fund.
That trading authority was increased to $15 million by the end of 2013. Park, as the agent and
manager of Argenta, managed a trading account held at the FCM Newedge USA, LLC on behalf
of the Master Fund (“Newedge Account”) from March 2013 until June 2014 and traded
commodity futures and forex. Throughout this time, Park was the sole person authorized to trade
in the Newedge Account for the benefit of the Master Fund.

52. During the course of Park’s management, the Master Fund suffered trading losses

of more than $1.9 million. Due to poor performance, Investment Firm A terminated its

Dz. False Statements to the NFA

53. In furtherance of its official duties under the Act, the NFA conducts periodic
audits and examinations of NFA members as a means of monitoring and assuring compliance
with NFA rules, the Act, and Commission Regulations. In addition, pursuant to NFA rules, the
Act, and Commission Regulations, CPOs are required to file with the NFA quarterly financial
reports for each pool the CPO operates.

54. Park and Kaseman, individually and as the agents of the registered Phaetra
entities, made multiple false or misleading statements to the NFA in statutorily required reports
filed between January 2014 and the present, and during an April 2016 NFA audit of the
registered Phaetra entities.

55. Between May 20, 2014 and the present, Phaetra GP and Phaetra Management, by
and through its agents Park and Kaseman, filed at least 18 false written reports with the NFA.
Despite that between January 1, 2014 and the present (the “reporting period”), Park solicited and
received funds from pool participants on behalf of the Phaetra entities, Phaetra GP and Phaetra
Management, by and through its agent Park, falsely represented to the NFA that although
registered as CPOs, Phaetra GP and Phaetra Management had not in fact been operating as CPOs
or CTAs during the reporting period. Kaseman, as Phaetra GP’s and Phaetra Management’s
Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Operating Officer, filed the majority of these false reports
with the NFA. Kaseman, who was also responsible for marketing, investor relations, and
internal operational details at Phaetra Management, and Park, knew these statements were false

because they knew or should have known that Park solicited funds from pool participants as the |

-17-
Case 1:16-cv-04120 Documenti Filed 06/02/16 Page 18 of 35

agent of the Phaetra entitiesduring the reporting period, and used these funds to traded forex and
commodity futures contracts. Park and Kaseman also knew that Phaetra Management, and its
predecessor Argenta, acted as a Commodity Trading Advisor (“CTA”) for the Master Fund.

56. On March 31, 2016, after the filing of the false quarterly reports, the NFA
contacted the Phaetra entities to announce a routine, on-site examination on the activities of the
firms to ensure the firms were in compliance with their recordkeeping and financial
requirements. Kaseman answered the call from NFA and represented to the NFA that Phaetra
GP and Phaetra Management had not conducted business in any capacity to date. Kaseman
further represented that Park actively traded her personal IB Trading Account at home.

57. OnApril 1, 2016, Kaseman telephoned the NFA and represented once again that
there was little to no activity in bank and broker accounts established for the Phaetra entities.

58. On April 4, 2016, NFA conducted an on-site examination of the Phaetra entities.
During the examination, Park and Kaseman both represented that:

a) neither of the Phaetra entities had commenced business of any kind;

b) neither the Phaetra entities nor Park or Kaseman currently managed any third-

party accounts; and

c) neither Argenta Capital GP LLC nor Argenta Capital LLC ever operated or

solicited business.

59, Pursuant to a NFA document request issued prior to the on-site visit, Phaetra GP
and Phaetra Management, by and through Park and Kaseman, represented to the NFA on the
same day of the on-site visit that the only proprietary or non-customer account maintained was

Park’s IB Trading Account. During the onsite meeting, Phaetra GP and Phaetra Management

-18-
Case 1:16-cv-04120 Documenti Filed 06/02/16 Page 19 of 35

both furnished the NFA with letters stating that they were not doing any business to date. The
letters state: “As of this date, we have not conducted any futures or forex business.”

60. Subsequent to the on-site examination and pursuant to a NFA request, Park
provided the NFA with statements to the IB Trading Account for the period October 1, 2015
through March 31, 2016 via email in the evening of April 4, 2016. In the same email exchange,
Park provided written representation that the activity in the IB Trading Account was proprietary
in nature and comprised solely of her personal funds.

61. Park and Kaseman knew these statements were false because they knew that Park
had solicited funds from pool participants on behalf of the Phaetra entities, and that Park had
been actively traded commodity futures contracts in the IB Trading Account throughout the
reporting period. Further, Park and Kaseman knew that that Park, on behalf of Argenta, entered
into a Commodity Trading Agreement with Investment Firm A and managed the Master Fund

from March 2013 to May 2014.
