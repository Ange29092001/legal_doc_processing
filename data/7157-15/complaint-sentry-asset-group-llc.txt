Plaintiff, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“Commission”), by its

attorneys, alleges as follows:
I. SUMMARY

1. From at least March 2012, and continuing through at least July 2013 (the
“Relevant Period”), Defendant Sentry Asset Group, LLC dba Sentry Asset Management, LLC
(“SAG”), by and through the actions of its employees and agents, including, but not limited to
Defendant, John Pakel (“Pakel’), (collectively, “‘Defendants”’), offered to enter into, or conducted
any office or business in the United States, for the purpose of soliciting or accepting any order
for the purchase or sale of precious metals from retail customers on a leveraged or financed
basis. These transactions constituted illegal, off-exchange retail commodity transactions. By
this conduct, Defendants have engaged, are engaging, or are about to engage in conduct in

violation of the Commodity Exchange Act (“Act”), 7 U.S.C. §§ 6(a) and 6d(a) (2012).
Case 9:15-cv-80506-XXXX Document1 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/20/2015 Page 2 of 14

2. Pakel controlled SAG throughout the Relevant Period and failed to act in good
faith or knowingly induced SAG’s violations alleged herein. Therefore, Pakel is liable for
SAG’s violations pursuant to 7 U.S.C. § 13c(b) (2012).

3. At all relevant times, the acts and omissions of Pakel and others were committed
within the scope of their employment, agency, or office with SAG. Therefore, SAG is liable
under 7 U.S.C. § 2(a)(1)(B) (2012), and Commission Regulation (“Regulation”) 17 C.F.R. § 1.2
(2014), as a principal for the actions and omissions of Pakel, and any other manager, employee
or agent of SAG in violation of the Act.

4, Accordingly, pursuant to 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1 (2012), the Commission brings this
action to enjoin Defendants’ unlawful acts and practices, to compel their compliance with the
Act, and to further enjoin them from engaging in any commodity-related activity.

5. In addition, the Commission seeks civil monetary penalties, restitution and
remedial ancillary relief, including, but not limited to, trading and registration bans,
disgorgement, rescission, pre- and post-judgment interest, and such other relief as the Court may
deem necessary and appropriate.

6. Unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, Defendants likely will continue to
engage in the acts and practices alleged in this Complaint and similar acts and practices, as more
fully described below.

II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

7. 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1 (2012) authorizes the Commission to seek injunctive relief
against any person whenever it shall appear to the Commission that such person has engaged, is
engaging, or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a violation of any provision of

the Act or any rule, regulation, or order thereunder.

14
Case 9:15-cv-80506-XXXX Document1 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/20/2015 Page 3 of 14

8. The Commission has jurisdiction over the conduct and transactions at issue in this
case pursuant to 7 U.S.C. §§ 2(c)(2)(D) and 13a-1 (2012).

9, Venue properly lies with the Court pursuant to 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1(e) (2012),
because Defendants transacted business in this District, and certain transactions, acts, and
practices alleged in this Complaint occurred, are occurring, and/or are about to occur within this
District.

Case 9:15-cv-80506-XXXX Document1 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/20/2015 Page 4 of 14

IV. RELATED ENTITIES

13. SAG introduced customers to Hunter Wise Commodities, LLC (“Hunter
Wise”), a precious metals dealer that confirmed the execution of customer precious metal
transactions, directly or through Lloyds Commodities, LLC (“Lloyds”). Hunter Wise was
formed as a California company in July 2007 and registered as a Nevada company in October
2010. It maintained business addresses in Las Vegas, Nevada and Irvine, California. Hunter
Wise held itself out on its website as “a physical commodity trading company, wholesaler,
market maker, back-office support provider, and finance company.” Hunter Wise purported to
offer, enter into, and confirm the execution of retail commodity transactions involving gold,
silver, platinum, palladium, and copper throughout the United States using a network of
telemarketing solicitors such as SAG that it referred to as “dealers.”

14. On February 19, 2014, this Court, in an action captioned CFTC v. Hunter Wise
Commodities, LLC, granted the Commission's Motion for Summary Judgment finding that
Hunter Wise and the other defendants violated 7 U.S.C. § 6(a) (2012). Case No. 9:12-cv-81311-
DMM (S.D. Fla. Feb. 19, 2014).

15. Lloyds is a Florida limited liability company with its principal place of business
in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. Lloyds was an intermediary firm that recruited precious metals
dealers to solicit customers who would execute retail commodity transactions through Hunter
Wise. Lloyds has never been registered with the Commission.

16. SAG also introduced customers to AmeriFirst Management, LLC
(“AmeriFirst”), a precious metals wholesaler and clearing firm that purported to confirm the

execution of customer off-exchange retail commodity transactions.
Case 9:15-cv-80506-XXXX Document1 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/20/2015 Page 5 of 14

17. AmeriFirst held itself out on its website as a precious metals clearing and
financing firm for precious metals dealers and claimed to provide dealers with “tangible assets in
a growing physical market” and guarantee[s] that every ounce of metal in [the dealer’s]
customers [sic] account exists and is ready for delivery at any point and time.” On its website,
AmeriFirst’s product offering was gold, silver, and platinum in bar and coin form. AmeriFirst
also claimed on its website to provide customer financing options for precious meta! dealers. It
operated throughout the United States using a network of over 30 solicitation firms such as SAG
that it refers to as “dealers.”

18. On February 25, 2013, AmeriFirst ceased operations.

19. On September 17, 2013, this Court, in an action captioned CFTC v. AmeriFirst
Management, LLC, entered a Consent Order of Permanent Injunction Against AmeriFirst,
finding that AmeriFirst violated 7 U.S.C. § 6(a) (2012). Case No. 9:13-cv-61637-WPD (S.D.
Fla. Sept. 17, 2013). In the order, AmeriFirst neither admitted nor denied its violations of
7 U.S.C. § 6(a) (2012). Id.

V. STATUTORY BACKGROUND

20. 7 U.S.C. §2(c)(2)(D) (2012) gives the Commission jurisdiction over “any
agreement, contract, or transaction in any commodity” that is entered into with, or offered to, a
non-eligible contract participant (“ECP”) “on a leveraged or margined basis, or financed by the
offeror, the counterparty, or a person acting in concert with the offeror or counterparty on a
similar basis” (“retail commodity transactions”) with respect to conduct occurring on or after
July 16, 2011, subject to certain exceptions not applicable here. 7 U.S.C. § 2(c)(2)(D) makes 7
U.S.C. § 6(a) (2012) applicable to retail commodity transactions “as if such transactions are

contracts for the sale of a commodity for future delivery.
Case 9:15-cv-80506-XXXX Document1 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/20/2015 Page 6 of 14

21. The Act defines an ECP, in relevant part, as an individual who has amounts
invested on a discretionary basis, the aggregate of which exceeds $10 million, or $5 million if the
individual enters into the transaction to manage the risk associated with an asset owned or
liability incurred, or reasonably likely to be owned or incurred, by the individual. 7 U.S.C.

§ 1a(18)(xi) (2012).

22. 7U.,S.C. § 6(a) (2012) in relevant part, makes it is unlawful for any person to
offer to enter into, execute, confirm the execution of, or conduct any office or business anywhere
in the United States for the purpose of soliciting, accepting any order for, or otherwise dealing in
any transaction in, or in connection with, a contract for the purchase or sale of a commodity for
future delivery unless the transaction is conducted on or subject to the rules of a board of trade
that has been designated or registered by the Commission as a contract market.

23. 7 U.S.C. § 6d(a) (2012) in relevant part, provides that it shall be unlawful for any
person to be a futures commission merchant (“FCM”) unless such person shall have registered
with the Commission as an FCM. In pertinent part, 17 C.F.R §1a (28) (2014) defines an FCM as
“an individual, association, partnership, corporation, or trust that is engaged in soliciting or in
accepting orders for...any agreement, contract, or transaction described in 7 U.S.C. §

2(c)(2\(C)(i) of this title or 7 U.S.C. § 2(c)(2)(D)(i)....”

VI. FACTS
24. During the Relevant Period, SAG was a telemarketing firm that solicited retail
customers to engage in off-exchange retail commodity transactions involving leveraged precious

metals. Although SAG also offered precious metals on a fully paid basis, the vast majority of its

14
Case 9:15-cv-80506-XXXX Document1i Entered on FLSD Docket 04/20/2015 Page 7 of 14

business was in off-exchange retail commodity transactions. It is only SAG’s off-exchange retail
commodity transactions through Hunter Wise and AmeriFirst that are at issue here.

25. During the Relevant Period, Pakel was a managing member, owner and
controlling person of SAG. Pakel was a signatory on SAG bank accounts, and entered into
agreements with AmeriFirst on behalf of SAG.

26. At various times during the Relevant Period, SAG employed Pakel and other
individuals to, among other things, solicit retail customers to engage in off-exchange retail
commodity transactions.

27. Pakel and SAG’s other employees conducted nearly all of their solicitations by
telephone. When soliciting customers for off-exchange retail commodity transactions, Pakel and
SAG’s other employees represented that to purchase a certain quantity of metal, the customers
needed to deposit a percentage of the total metal value, and that customers would receive a loan
for the remaining amount. Lloyds, Hunter Wise or AmeriFirst provided the financing for the
loans to the customers. However, SAG did not disclose to all of their customers Lloyds’, Hunter
Wise’s or AmeriFirst’s involvement in their off-exchange retail commodity transactions.

28. After a non-ECP customer invested, SAG contacted Lloyds, Hunter Wise or
AmeriFirst to effectuate the transaction. SAG collected the funds needed for the transaction
from the customer and sent them to Lloyds, Hunter Wise or AmeriFirst. Lloyds purportedly
forwarded funds that it received from SAG to Hunter Wise. Hunter Wise and AmeriFirst
provided back office support services to SAG and provided access to the details of the
transaction to the customer.

29. With respect to the retail commodity transactions, SAG charged customers

commissions, storage and other fees for purchasing the metal and interest on loans to buy metal.

14
Case 9:15-cv-80506-XXXX Document1 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/20/2015 Page 8 of 14

Lloyds/Hunter Wise provided SAG’s share of the commissions and fees to SAG after it received
the customer’s funds from SAG. AmeriFirst initially operated in a similar fashion, but it later
directed SAG to deduct its commissions and fees from customer funds before forwarding those
funds to AmeriFirst.

30. With the exception of a few instances which are not the subject of this action,
SAG’s customers did not take delivery of precious metals. Rather, the vast majority of SAG’s
customers were only engaging in these transactions with SAG in order to speculate on the price
direction of the precious metals.

31. Of more than $1.1 million collected by SAG during the Relevant Period,
$278,767 was paid to managers of SAG, presumably in the form of fees and commissions.

32. SAG, Lloyds, Hunter Wise and AmeriFirst never bought, sold, loaned, stored, or
transferred any physical metals for these off-exchange retail commodity transactions. Likewise,
SAG, Lloyds, Hunter Wise and AmeriFirst never delivered any precious metals to any customers
with respect to these financed metals transactions.

33. At all times during the Relevant Period, Pakel was an owner, operator and
controlling person of SAG. He exercised control over the day-to-day operations of SAG, opened
bank accounts and entered into agreements on behalf of SAG.

VII. VIOLATIONS OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT
COUNT I

ILLEGAL OFF-EXCHANGE TRADING
Violations of 7 U.S.C. § 6(a) (2012)

35. During the Relevant Period, the retail] commodity transactions described in this
Complaint were offered and entered into by Defendants (a) on a leveraged or margined basis, or
financed by the offeror, the counterparty, or a person acting in concert with the offeror or
counterparty on a similar basis, (b) with persons who are not ECPs or eligible commercial
entities as defined by the Act, and (c) not made or conducted on, or subject to, the rules of any
board of trade, exchange or contract market.

36. The retail commodity transactions described herein are commodities as defined in
7 ULS.C. § 1a(9) (2012).

37. As set forth above, during the Relevant Period, Defendants SAG and Pakel
violated 7 U.S.C. § 6(a) (2012) by offering to enter into, entering into, executing, confirming the
execution of, or conducting an office or business in the United States for the purpose of soliciting
or accepting orders for, or otherwise dealing in, transactions in, or in connection with, retail
commodity transactions.

38. Each offer to enter into, entrance into, execution, confirmation, solicitation, or
acceptance of an order for a retail commodity transaction made during the Relevant Period to a
non-ECP customer is alleged as a separate and distinct violation of 7 U.S.C. § 6(a) (2012).

39. Pakel directly or indirectly controlled SAG and did not act in good faith or
knowingly induced, directly or indirectly, the acts constituting SAG’s violations of 7 U.S.C. §
6(a) (2012), alleged in this Complaint. Therefore, pursuant to 7 U.S.C. § 13c(b) (2012), Pakel is
liable for each of SAG’s violations of 7 U.S.C. § 6(a) (2012).

40. The acts and omissions of Pakel and the managers, agents and or persons acting
for SAG described in this Complaint were done within the scope of their employment, agency or

office with SAG. Therefore, SAG is liable as a principal for each act, omission, or failure of

Case 9:15-cv-80506-XXXX Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/20/2015 Page 10 of 14

Pakel and SAG’s other managers, agents or persons acting for SAG, constituting violations of 7
U.S.C. § 6(a) (2012), pursuant to 7 U.S.C § 2(a)(1)(B) (2012) and17 C.F.R. § 1.2 (2014).
COUNT II

FAILURE TO REGISTER
Violations of 7 U.S.C. § 6d(a) (2012)

41. Paragraphs | through 40 of this Complaint are re-alleged and incorporated herein
by reference.

42. During the relevant period, SAG, through its managers, agents and employees,
acted as an FCM by soliciting and accepting orders for agreements, contracts, or transactions
described in 7 U.S.C. § 2(c)(2)(D)(i) (2012), i.e., retail commodity transactions.

43. 7 ULS.C. § 6d(a) (2012) provides that it shall be unlawful for any person to be an
FCM unless such person shall have registered with the Commission as an FCM.

44. —_ During the relevant period, Defendants failed to register with the Commission as
an FCM, and therefore, violated 7 U.S.C. § 6d(a) (2012).

45. Pakel directly or indirectly controlled SAG and did not act in good faith or
knowingly induced, directly or indirectly, the acts constituting SAG’s violations of 7 U.S.C. §
6d(a) (2012), alleged in this Complaint. Therefore, pursuant to 7 U.S.C. § 13c(b) (2012), Pakel
is liable for each of SAG’s violations of 7 U.S.C. § 6d(a) (2012).

46. The acts, omissions and failures of Pakel and other managers, agents or persons
acting for SAG described in this Complaint occurred within the scope of their employment,
agency or office with SAG, and are deemed to be the acts, omissions and failures of SAG by

operation of 7 U.S.C. § 2(a)(1)(B) (2012) and 17 C.F.R. § 1.2 (2014).
