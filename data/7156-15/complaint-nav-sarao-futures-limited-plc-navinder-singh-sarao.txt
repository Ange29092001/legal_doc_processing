COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, CIVIL MONETARY PENALTIES, AND
OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF

The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (Commission or CFTC), by and through its

attorneys, hereby alleges as follows:
I. INTRODUCTION

l. During certain periods from June 2009 to the present, Defendants engaged and are
engaging in a massive effort to manipulate the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s (CME’s) E-mini
S&P 500 futures contract (the E-mini S&P) by utilizing a variety of exceptionally large,
aggressive, and persistent spoofing tactics. In particular, beginning in Fines 2009, Defendants
schemed to design and utilize an automated system to manipulate the E-mini S&P price to their
benefit. From at least April 2010 to January 2012; July 2012 to June aul and Senrenntser: 2014 to
present (the Relevant Period), Navinder Sarao (Sarao) and/or his company Nav Sarao Futures
Limited PLC (Sarao Futures), acting through its agents and employees, including Sarao,
(collectively, Defendants), used this automated system, as well as a variety of manual techniques, to

place, modify, and cancel hundreds of thousands of orders with no intention of executing such
orders so as to affect the E-mini S&P price such that Defendants could profit from their other
trading. Defendants’ actions caused artificial prices to exist in the intra-day price of the lead month
of the E-mini S&P during the Relevant Period, including on at least the following 12 days: April
27, May 4-6, and May 10, 2010; January 28, F ebruary 22, March 4, May 2, July 29, and August 4,
2011: and March 10, 2014 (the Example Price-Impact Days).' This period includes May 6, 2010,
commonly known as the Flash Crash Day, when E-mini S&P prices, along with many U.S. equities
prices, quickly and dramatically plummeted and then recovered in a matter of minutes.

2. Defendants’ manipulative scheme involves numerous aggressive spoofing tactics.
First, Defendants utilized an automated “layering” algorithm (the Layering Algorithm) that
typically simultaneously layered four to six exceptionally large sell orders into the visible E-mini
S&P central limit order book (Order Book). Each sell order was one price level from the next,
' generally beginning at least three or four price levels from the best asking price in the Order Book.
As the market price moved, Defendants’ Layering Algorithm automatically simultaneously moved
the large layered sell orders, resulting in the orders remaining at least three or four price levels from
the best asking price in the Order Book. This caused the orders to remain visible to other market
participants in the Order Book, with very little risk of the sell orders resulting in a consummated
trade because each order was several price levels above the best asking price.

3... On average, on the Example Price-Impact Days, Defendants used the Layering
Algorithm to place hundreds of orders for tens of thousands of contracts that were modified

thousands of times and eventually canceled over 99% without ever resulting in a trade. At times on

 

' Defendants’ manipulation of the E-mini S&P futures market was not limited solely to the
Example Price-Impact Days. These specific days are referenced for illustrative purposes only.
Plaintiff anticipates supplementing the Example Price-Impact Days as additional information is
obtained and analyzed. OO
the Example Price-Impact Days when the Layering Algorithm was active, Defendants’ sell-side
orders constituted as much as 40% of all active sell-side orders.
4, On each of the Example Price-Impact Days, as well as on other days during the
Relevant Period, Defendants intentionally utilized the Layering Algorithm to overload the sell side
of the Order Book to temporarily artificially lower the E-mini S&P market price. Moreover, when
Defendants turned off the Layering Algorithm, the artificially lowered price typically rebounded to
its previous level. During the Example Price-Impact Days, as well as on other days during the
Relevant Period, Defendants cycled the Layering Algorithm on and off numerous times in order to
cause temporary price volatility. Defendants took advantage of this price volatility by trading an
exceptionally high volume of E-mini S&P contracts in a manner designed to profit from the
artificial price swings. On each of the Example Price-Impact Days, Defendants traded on average
$7.8 billion in notional value, resulting in daily profits averaging approximately $53 0,000. In
total, Defendants profited approximately $6.4 million on the twelve specific Example Price-Impact
Days alleged herein. |
5. Defendants’ scheme further involved other unlawful Order Book activities in the E-
mini S&P contract. Specifically, throughout the Relevant Period, Defendants “flashed” large lot
orders in a variety of lot sizes in the Order Book that were quickly canceled with no intention of
these orders resulting in trades (Flash Spoofing). At times during the Relevant Period, the Flash
Spoofing was used with and to amplify the price impact of the Layering Algorithm. At other
times, Defendants’ Flash Spoofing was used alone to benefit Defendants’ trading strategies.
6. For instance, on the Example Price-Impact Days, Defendants repeatedly engaged in
a Flash Spoofing tactic whereby Defendants manually placed and canceled orders in lot sizes of

188 and 289 contracts (the 188/289 Spoofing), typically one or two levels away from the best bid
or ask price in the Order Book. Defendants primarily utilized 188/289 Lot Spoofing on the sell
side of the Order Book in conjunction with the Layering Algorithm. |

7. At various times during the Relevant Period, Defendants used other Flash Spoofing
tactics involving differing large-lot orders, including frequently placing and canceling 2000 lot
orders (2000 Lot Spoofing). Defendants engaged in the 2000 Lot Spoofing when attempting to
execute orders on the opposite side of the Order Book at favorable prices. Defendants placed the
Large Lot Spoofing orders with no intention of executing trades.

8. Presently, Sarao is actively trading high volumes in the E-mini S&P market in a
personal account. Sarao continues to engage in spoofing activity by, among other things, placing
and quickly canceling orders with no intention of executing a trade.

9. Defendants have actively placed orders and traded in the E-mini S&P market on at
least 800 days during the Relevant Period. Upon information and belief, Defendants engaged in
one or more of the above spoofing tactics on the vast majority of days they were actively trading in
the E-mini S&P market during the Relevant Period. During the Relevant Period, Defendants
profited from their E-mini S&P trading by approximately $40 million.

10. These acts and practices constitute violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (Act
or CEA), 7 U.S.C. §§ 1 et seg. (2012), and Regulations promulgated by the Commission.
Specifically, Defendants’ conduct violates Sections 4c(a)(5)(C), 6(c)(1) and (3),” and 9(a)(2) of the
Act, 7 U.S.C. §§ 6c(a)(5)(C), 9(1) & (3), and 13(a)(2) (2012), and Commission Regulations
(Regulations) 180.1 and 180.2, 17 C.F.R. § 180.2 (2014), which, among other things, make it

unlawful for any person to manipulate, attempt to manipulate, use a manipulative device, or attempt

 

* Section 6(c)(1) and (3) of the Act became effective on August 15,2011. Prior to that date,
Defendants’ conduct violated Section 6(c) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. §§ 9, 15 (2008).

4
to use a manipulative device, or spoof the market of any commodity in interstate commerce or for
future delivery on or subject to the rules of any registered entity, including any contract market.

11. Sarao committed the acts described herein within the course and scope of his
employment at, or agency with, Sarao Futures; therefore, Sarao Futures is liable under Section
2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 2(a)(1)(B) (2012), and Regulation 1.2, 17 C.F.R. § 1.2 (2014), asa
principal for its agents’ acts, omissions, or failures.

12. Sarao controlled Sarao Futures, directly or indirectly, and did not act in good faith
or knowingly induced, directly or indirectly, the acts of Sarao Futures that constitute the violations
alleged in this Complaint; therefore, pursuant to Section 13(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 13c(b) (2012),
Sarao is liable as a controlling person for violations of the Act and Regulations committed by Sarao
Futures.

13. Plaintiff Commission brings this action pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, TUS.C.
§ 13a-1 (2012), to enjoin Defendants’ violative acts and practices and to compel Defendants’
compliance with the Act and Regulations. In addition, the CFTC seeks civil monetary penalties and

such other equitable relief, including but not limited to disgorgement, as this Court deems necessary

or appropriate.
II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE
14. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, which

authorizes the Commission to seek injunctive relief against any person, or to enforce compliance
with the Act and Regulations, whenever it shall appear to the Commission that such person has
engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a violation of any
provision of the Act or any rule, regulation, or order thereunder.

15. Venue properly lies with this Court pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.

§ 13a-1(e) (2012), in that Defendants transact business in this District, and the acts and practices in
5
violation of the Act and Regulations have occurred, are occurring, or are about to occur within this
‘District.
Til. THE PARTIES
16. The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an independent federal
regulatory agency that is charged by Congress with the responsibility for administering and
enforcing the provisions of the Act, 7 U.S.C. §§ 1 et seq., and the Regulations promulgated
thereunder, 17 C.F.R. §§ 1 ef seg. (2014). One of its core responsibilities is to protect the public
interest by deterring and preventing price manipulations of the commodity markets or futures
markets or other disruptions to market integrity. See 7 U.S.C. § 5(b) (2012).
17. Nav Sarao Futures Limited PLC is a private limited company incorporated in the
United Kingdom with its principal place of business in London, England. Sarao Futures began
operations on or about July 1, 2005. Sarao Futures has never been registered with the Commission.
18. | Navinder Singh Sarao resides in London, England and is the owner and sole
employee and trader of Sarao Futures. Sarao was responsible for trades on behalf of Sarao Futures

during the Relevant Period. Sarao has been a member of the CME since May 2008. Sarao has

never been registered with the Commission.

IV. FACTS
A. Background
i. Definitions
19. A futures contract is an agreement to purchase or sell a financial instrument or

physical commodity for delivery or cash settlement in the future at a price determined at initiation
of the contract that obligates each party to the contract to fulfill the contract at the specified price.

Futures contracts are used to assume or shift price risk and may be satisfied by cash settlement,
delivery, or offset. Futures contracts are commonly used to hedge risks or to speculate on the price
of financial instruments or physical commodities.

20. Open interest represents the total number of futures contracts in a market that
remain “open” at the end of a trading session across all available contract months. In other words,
open interest refers to those contracts not yet liquidated either by an offsetting futures market
transaction or delivery. For each open contract there is a “short” and a “long” position. For
example, if open interest is one hundred contracts, then there are outstanding one hundred short
contracts and one hundred long contracts. A trader who has no open interest (and thus no exposure
to market risk) is said to be “flat.”

21. Volume is the number of purchases or sales of futures contracts made during a
specified period of time. |

22. An “order” is a submission to an exchange to buy or sell a futures contract that has
been acknowledged by an exchange and entered into an order book. An order “lot” typically
consists of one contract. An “order modification” is a change to an order that is in the order book.

_ An “order cancellation” is the cancellation of an existing order that is in the order book.

23. A limit order allows a buyer to define the maximum price to pay and the seller the
minimum price to accept (the Limit Price). A limit order remains on the order book until the order
is either executed, canceled, or expires. Any portion of the order that can be matched is
immediately executed.

24. <A “bid” is an offer to buy a specific quantity of an exchange-traded product at a

stated price.

25. An “ask” is an offer to sell a specific quantity of an exchange-traded product at a

stated price.
26. The “2010 Flash Crash” refers to an event that occurred on May 6, 2010 in the U.S.
financial markets. Between 1:41 and 1:44 p.m. CT, the E-mini S&P market price suffered a sharp
decline of 3%. Then, at 1:45 p.m. CT, in a matter of 15 seconds, the E-mini S&P market price
declined another 1.7%. The price crash in the E-mini S&P market quickly spread to major U.S.
equities indices which suffered precipitous declines in value of approximately 5 to 6%, with some
individual equities suffering much larger declines. After a few minutes, markets quickly rebounded
to near previous price levels. In their Preliminary Findings Regarding the Events of May 6, 2010,
the CFTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission noted that a significant imbalance between
sell orders and buy orders contributed to a sudden loss of liquidity in the E-mini S&P market. This
loss of liquidity, in conjunction with other market events, directly contributed to the E-mini S&P
price crash.

ii, | E-mini S&P Market Fundamentals

27. The E-mini S&P is regularly traded in five contract months in the March quarterly
cycle (March, June, September, and December).

28. Prices of the E-mini S&P contract are $50 times the value of the S&P 500 Index.
During the Relevant Period, the E-mini S&P contract’s average price was approximately $1,519
and the average volume was about 1.7 million contracts traded per day.

29. . During the Relevant Period, prior to November 19, 2012, the trading day began on
the electronic trading platform, Globex, at 3:30 p.m. CT and continued to 3:15 p.m. CT the next
day. Trading halted from 3:15 p.m. CT to 3:30 p.m. CT after November 19, 2012, the trading day

began on Globex at 5:00 p.m. CT and continued to 4:15 p.m. CT the next day. .

30. The Order Book is an electronic market structure that matches customer orders

based on price and time priority. The highest bid and lowest ask constitute the “best market” or
“touch.” Prices in the Order Book move in increments of one quarter cent per index point, known
as a “tick.” A movement in price of one tick results in a change in the value of the contract by
$12.50. Orders at the best ten ticks on the buy and sell side of the Order Book are visible to other
market participants.

31. Trading in the E-mini S&P is conducted electronically via the CME’s Globex
electronic trading system. Globex traders have the ability to enter, modify, and cancel bids and
offers in a matter of milliseconds through a computer portal to the Globex platform.

32. When a “buy” or “sell” order is placed on Globex, the order becomes part of the
Order Book. The Order Book displays the total order volume ten ticks deep on both the bid and ask
side. Individual orders are aggregated at each tick, so it is typically not possible for market
participants to identify individual orders within the Order Book. Globex functions such that the
best available bid or ask price must be taken (“hit” or “lifted”) by the market for a trade to occur,
before the next available best bid or ask price can be taken. The best bid price is the highest
available price for buy orders that are posted in the market. The best ask price is the lowest
available price for sell orders that are posted in the market.

33. Many market participants, relying on the information contained in the Order Book,
consider the total relative number of bid and ask offers in the Order Book when making trading
decisions. For instance, if the total number of sell orders significantly outweighs the total number
of buy orders, market participants may believe a price drop is imminent and trade accordingly.
Similarly, if the balance of buy and sell orders changes abruptly, market participants may believe
the new orders represent legitimate changes to supply and demand and therefore trade accordingly.

Further, many market participants utilize automated trading systems that analyze the market for
these types of order imbalances and use that information to determine trading strategies.
Consequently, actions in the Order Book can, and do, affect the price of the E-mini S&P.

34. A long position in the E-mini S&P is a market position in which the trader has
bought E-mini S&P contracts that do not offset a previously established short position. A trader
profits on a long position when the price of E-mini S&P increases.

35. A short position in the E-mini S&P is a market position in which the trader has sold
E-mini S&P contracts that do not offset a previously established long positon. A trader profits on
the short position when the price of the E-mini S&P decreases.

iii. Background Information About Defendants’. Trading Activities

36. During the Relevant Period, Defendants utilized a combination of automated and
manual trading systems to place, modify, and cancel orders, resulting in a very high number of
orders, modifications, cancelations, and transactions, especially compared to other E-mini S&P
market participants. Defendants actively traded in the E-mini S&P market on over at least 800
days during the Relevant Period. As recently as April 6, 2015 Defendants continued to trade the
E-mini S&P.

37. | Generally, during the Relevant Period, Defendants employed a high-frequency,
day-trading strategy in the E-mini S&P market. The objective for most high-frequency day traders
is to take large short-term positions and quickly trade out of those positions to profit from small
price movements in the market. Frequently, during the Relevant Period, Defendants would
establish large, short-term positions on either side of the market throughout the day and quickly
trade out of those positions. Defendants typically repeated this cycle many times a day, but would

normally begin and end each day flat, holding no positions.

10
38. For example, on May 4, 2010, Defendants had established a long position of over
2,000 E-mini S&P contracts, and over a forty-minute period, then proceeded to repeatedly sell and
buy E-mini S&P contracts such that, at the end the forty-minute period, Defendants had
established a short position of over 1,500 contracts. This cycle was repeated several times during
the day, and Defendants ultimately ended the day flat, profiting $876,823 from this trading. On
that day, Defendants had the fifth highest trading volume in the E-mini S&P, trading 130,030 E-
mini S&P contracts. |

39. Defendants’ spoofing tactics were intended to complement Defendants’ trading
strategy by injecting volatility into and causing price movements in the E-mini S&P market, which
Defendants could exploit and profit.

iv. Defendants’ Trading Accounts

40. Defendants traded the E-mini S&P at four futures commission merchants (FCMs)
during the Relevant Period: FCM A (April 2010 to October 2011), FCM B (November 2011 to
January 2012), FCM C (July 2012 to August 2012), and FCM D (August 2012 to June
2014). Sarao began trading the E-mini S&P contract in a personal account at FCM D in October

_ 2014 and continues to do so.through the present. The majority of Defendants’ trading occurred

using the accounts at FCMs A and D. At all times during the Relevant Period, Sarao was

responsible for all trading decisions relating to Defendants’ accounts.

B. Defendants’ Manipulative Scheme

41. During the Relevant Period, Defendants engaged, and Sarao is currently engaging,
in a scheme to manipulate the price of the E-mini S&P utilizing a variety of spoofing tactics in the
E-mini S&P Order Book designed to cause price swings that Defendants could exploit through
their trading. Specifically, Defendants utilized the Layering Algorithm and Flash Spoofing, at

times in conjunction and at times in isolation, on the vast majority of trading days throughout the

11
Relevant Period.
i. Defendants’ Creation and Use of the Layering Algorithm

42. The Layering Algorithm.is an automated program utilized by Defendants during the
Relevant Period to initiate, quickly and repeatedly modify, and eventually cancel several sell orders
simultaneously in such a manner that the orders were visible to other market participants, but did
not result in executed transactions.

a) Defendants’ Creation of the Layering Algorithm
43. Prior to June 2009, Defendants used an off-the-shelf trading platform commonly

utilized by traders in the futures trading industry to place E-mini S&P orders. Beginning in June.

2009, Sarao sought technical assistance in modifying the trading platform to create an automated
_ trading algorithm designed to rapidly place, modify, and cancel orders in the E-mini S&P market.
Specifically, Sarao emailed a representative at FCM A and indicated that he needed technical
assistance in programming a “cancel if close function, 50 that an order is canceled if the market
gets close.”

44. Shortly thereafter, Sarao emailed directions to a representative of the company that
designed and sold his off-the-shelf trading platform. In that email, Sarao indicated that he wanted
the trading program to be altered to have numerous additional functions, including, among other
things:

e a “cancel if close function”;

e the ability to “alternate the closeness ie one price away or three prices
away”;

e “a facility to be able to enter multiple orders at different prices using one

click”;

12
e “(t]he ability for my orders to rest on particular size, ie my order will be
pulled if there are not x amount of orders beneath it”; and

e “[t]he ability for my orders to only allow 1 clip to go into them. Hence, if I
am working 500 lot and a 2 lot trades, the 498 balance is removed
immediately.”

45. Subsequently, in November 2009, Sarao emailed a representative of the trading
system company thanking him for assisting in modifying the trading platform and noting that he
“found [the modified platform] really useful.” Sarao further indicated that

[t]he system you set up was basically one whereby I turn the [trading platform] on or off

and when it was turned on it would put offers a specific value and quantity away from the

best offer. In the version you set up, we always had offers 3, 4, 5 and 6 prices away from
the best offer.
Sarao went on to request that the individual give him the code used so that Sarao could “play
around with creating new versions” of the modified platform.

46. In October 2011, Sarao emailed a representative of a software firm about further

refining his trading program.
b) Defendants’ Use of the Layering Algorithm
47. On the Example Price-Impact Days during the Relevant Period, Defendants used
the Layering Algorithm to place four to six exceptionally large sell orders into the Order Book,
each one tick from the next, generally beginning at least three or four ticks from the best asking
price. As the market price moved, the Layering Algorithm automatically simultaneously modified
the large layered sell-side order prices, resulting in the orders remaining at least three or four ticks
_ from the best asking price in the Order Book. These orders were modified hundreds of times in

order to keep them from resulting in executed trades. Defendants placed the Layering Algorithm

orders with no intention of these orders resulting in transactions.

13
48. On the Example Price-Impact Days, the Layering Algorithm orders differed
significantly from average E-mini S&P orders. For instance:

a. The Layering Algorithm orders were canceled without execution at a
much higher rate (99+% canceled with no execution) than similarly sized
orders placed by other traders (less than 49% canceled with no
execution); |

b. The Layering Algorithm orders were much larger (504 contracts on
average) than other traders’ orders (7 contracts on average); and

c. The Layering Algorithm orders were modified much more frequently
(average 161 modifications per order) than other traders’ orders (average
less than 1 modification per order).

49, On the Example Price-Impact Days, Defendants’ total order modifications
comprised at least 60% of the total sell-side market order modification volume, meaning that
Defendants’ total order modification volume was more than one and a half times that of the rest of
the market. |

50. On the Example Price-Impact Days, Defendants used the Layering Algorithm to
place, modify, and cancel orders in cycles typically lasting less than 6 minutes. After canceling the
Layering Algorithm orders, Defendants typically let the E-mini S&P market price rebound for 2 to
3 minutes before beginning a new cycle of orders, modifications, and cancellations. On the
Example Price Impact Days, Defendants used the Layering Algorithm for a combined total of
almost than 38 hours.

51. These Layering Algorithm cycles had the ability to, and did, create large Order

Book imbalances between the sell and buy side of the E-mini S&P market. On many occasions

14
when the Layering Algorithm was operating, Defendants’ sell-side orders accounted for
approximately 20% of the total sell-side orders in the Order Book and sometimes reached as high as
40%. On average, the Layering Algorithm orders added over $150 million in notional value to the
sell-side Order Book imbalance.

52. The order book imbalances created by Defendants on the Example Price-Impact
Days had the ability to affect the E-mini S&P market price and, in fact, were intended to have an
effect on the E-mini S&P market price by indicating to other market participants that sell-side
demand outpaced buy-side demand. a

53. In fact, Defendants’ use of the Layering Algorithm did impact the price of the E-
mini S&P market. On the Example Price-Impact Days, Defendants’ use of the Layering Algorithm
caused the price in the E-mini S&P contract to be temporarily artificially depressed while the
Layering Algorithm was active. Once the Layering Algorithm was turned off and the orders were
canceled, the market price typically rebounded. In other words, Defendants’ use of the Layering
Algorithm introduced artificial volatility into the E-mini S&P futures market and caused artificial
prices to exist.

54. While the Layering Algorithm was operating on the Example Price-Impact Days,
Defendants traded in a manner designed to profit both from the temporary artificial price drop in the
E-mini S&P and from the rebounding price after the Layering Algorithm was turned off. When the
Layering Algorithm was on, Defendants typically attempted to take advantage of the expected price
drop caused by the Layering Algorithm by repeatedly selling a very high volume of E-mini S&P
contracts and buying the contracts back at a lower price. When the Layering Algorithm was turned
off, Defendants typically bought a very high volume of E-mini S&P contracts and sold the contracts

at a profit as the price rebounded.

15
55. On the Example Price-Impact Days, Defendants traded a total notional value of
approximately $93.1 billion in the E-mini S&P contract and made a total profit of approximately
$6.4 million. oe

56. During the Relevant Period, Defendants used the Layering Algorithm on at least
442 trading days.

57. Upon information and belief, during the remainder of the Relevant Period,
Defendants used the Layering Algorithm in the same or similar manner as it was used on the
Example Price-Impact Days and Defendants’ use of the Layering Algorithm caused artificially
depressed prices in the E-mini S&P futures market.

re) Example of the Layering Algorithm Causing an Artificial Price

58. On trading day May 4, 2010, Defendants turned on the Layering Algorithm 31
times, leaving it on for an average of 6.45 minutes. At 11:00:36.846 a.m. CT, Defendants placed
four nearly-simultaneous (within 0.002 seconds of one another) orders of 600 lots each at the
following prices: 1173.25, 1173.50, 1173.75, and 1174.00. Thus, the order closest to the best ask
was still three ticks above the price of 1172.50. These orders were each modified 152 times (one
of these orders was canceled and immediately replaced by an identical order; the sum of these two
orders’ modifications was 152), with each modification occurring when the market price changed
to ensure the orders stayed at least three ticks away from the best ask. Defendants canceled the
orders at 11:12:38.762 a.m. CT without any portion of them having been filled. The notional value
of these Layering Algorithm orders exceeded $140 million.

59. | Defendants repeated this basic sequence of events 31 times that day, resulting in a
total of 141 orders (totaling 83,900 lots) placed and canceled, and 12,693

modifications. Defendants had the Layering Algorithm on for three hours and twenty minutes that

16
day and caused artificial prices to occur repeatedly throughout the day in the lead month of the E-
mini S&P futures contract.

60. Defendants took advantage of the artificial price swings caused by the Layering
Algorithm by executing buy orders totaling 65,015 lots and sell orders totaling 65,015 lots with a
total notional value of $7.6 billion and booked a profit of $876,823.

61. On May 4, 2010, Defendants were the fifth-largest traders in the E-mini S&P,
trading 130,030 E-mini S&P contracts. Additionally, Defendants order modifications comprised
approximately 60% of the total sell-side order modification volume on May 4, 2010.

ii. Defendants’ Use of Flash Spoofing
62. In addition to the Layering Algorithm, Defendants frequently manually “flashed”
large-lot orders in a variety of lot sizes in the Order Book that were quickly canceled with no
intention of these orders resulting in trades. At times during the Relevant Period, the Flash
Spoofing was used with and to amplify the impact of the Layering Algorithm. At other times,
Defendants’ Flash Spoofing was used alone to benefit Defendants’ trading strategies.
a) The 188/289-Lot Spoofing |

63. On the Example Price-Impact Days, Defendants often “flashed” and quickly
canceled several large-lot orders, typically on the sell-side of the Order Book. Specifically,
Defendants manually placed 1,728 sell-side orders in lot sizes of 188 and 289 with an approximate
_ notional value of $26.5 billion. Defendants then canceled approximately 95% of the 188 and 289
lot sell orders prior to any execution.

64. These orders were typically placed on the sell-side of the Order Book, normally two

or three ticks from the best ask and almost 80% were placed while the Layering Algorithm was

17
operating. Frequently, two or more of each order size were placed simultaneously at the same price
level. These orders were typically canceled within two seconds. |

65. The 188/289-Lot Spoofing was primarily used to exacerbate the price impact of the
Layering Algorithm by creating extreme momentary sell-side order imbalance. Defendants placed
the 188-lot and 289-lot orders with no intention of these orders resulting in transactions.

66. For instance, on May 5, 2010, from 11:22 a.m. CT to 12:30 p.m. CT, Defendants
turned on the Layering Algorithm, placing five orders totaling 2,500 contracts with a notional value
of $146.3 million. The orders were one tick apart, starting two ticks from the best asking price.
During this hour-long period, Defendants added 107 188-lot and 289-lot sell orders. These orders
amounted to 25,267 contracts. All but four of these orders were canceled before any execution and
the median cancelation time was less than a second.

67. Upon information and belief, at many times during the Relevant Period, Defendants
utilized the 188/289-Lot Spoofing in a same or similar manner as on the Example Price-Impact

Days.

b) 2000 Lot Spoofing
68. In addition to using the 188/289 Lot Spoofing, Defendants used other Flash

Spoofing tactics involving large-lot orders. For instance, Defendants frequently flashed and
quickly canceled orders of 2000 lots, typically at the best bid or ask on both the sell- and buy-sides
of the E-mini S&P market when attempting to enter into transactions on the opposite side of the
market. Defendant intended the 2000 Lot Spoofing orders to trick other market participants into
executing Defendants’ orders on the opposite side of the market at favorable prices. Once
Defendants other orders were executed, Defendants would typically cancel the 2000 Lot Spoofing

orders.

18
69. For instance, on March 3, 2014, at 11:38:27.538 a.m. CT, Defendants placed a 2000
Lot Spoofing order on the buy-side at a price of $1,839.25. Within 0.2 seconds, Defendants placed
a sell order of 169 lots at price $1,839.50 (one tick away from the price of the 2000 Lot Spoofing
buy order), which began filling immediately. Less than one second later, after filling 20 lots of the
sell order, Defendants canceled the buy-side 2000 Lot Spoofing order before it had any executions.
At 11:38:31.826 a.m. CT, Defendants placed another buy-side 2000 Lot Spoofing order at the
same price of $1,839.25, and within one millisecond Defendants filled the remainder of the 169-lot
sell order. At 11:38:32.336 a.m. CT, approximately one half-second after placing the order,
Defendants canceled this second 2000 Lot Spoofing order before it had any executions.
Defendants placed these 2000 Lot Spoofing orders with the intent to cancel the orders prior to
execution.

70. Additionally, on September 30, 2013, at 12:30:38.987 p.m. CT, Defendants placed
a 2,000 Lot Spoofing order on the buy-side at a price of $1,678.50. Simultaneously, Defendants
placed a sell order of 384 lots at price $1,678.75 (one tick away from the price of 2000 Lot
Spoofing order), which began filling immediately. Less than one second later, after filling 89 lots
of the sell order, Defendants canceled the 2000 Lot Spoofing order before it had any executions.
Four seconds later, at 12:30:42.867 p.m. CT, Defendants placed another buy-side 2000 Lot
Spoofing order at the same price of $1,678.50 and canceled it after approximately 0.7 seconds.
Defendants then filled an additional 101 lots of the sell-side order. Six seconds later, at
12:30:49.165 p.m. CT, Defendants placed yet another buy-side 2000 Lot Spoofing order, also at
price $1,678.50. While this final Flash Spoofing Order was active, Defendants filled the rest of the

sell-side order. Defendants canceled the third 2000 Lot Spoofing order in less than one second, at

19
12:30:49.708 p.m. CT. Defendants placed these 2000 Lot Spoofing orders with the intent to cancel
the orders prior to execution. |

71. Upon information and belief, Defendants engaged in 2000 Lot Spoofing on
hundreds of occasions during the Relevant Period and placed the 2000 Lot Spoofing orders with the
intent to cancel the orders prior to execution.

ili. Defendants’ Actions on the 2010 Flash Crash Day

72. Defendants aggressively used both the Layering Algorithm and the 188/289-Lot |
Spoofing strategies on May 6, 2010, the 2010 Flash Crash day.

73. Defendants first turned on the Layering Algorithm at 9:20 a.m. CT, placing four
orders, totaling 2,100 contracts. These orders were each one tick apart, starting three ticks from the
best ask. The orders were modified 604 times over the following six minutes so the orders were
always at the third level of the sell-side of the order book or deeper, and then canceled with no
executions, as the Layering Algorithm was turned off. While the first cycle of the Layering
Algorithm was active, the E-mini S&P price fell 39 basis points.

74. While the first cycle of the Layering Algorithm was active, Defendants bought
1,606 contracts and sold 1,032 contracts.

75. Defendants’ use of the Layering Algorithm and the 188/289-Lot Spoofing
intensified throughout the day. At 11:17 a.m. CT, Defendants turned the Layering Algorithm on for
more than two consecutive hours, until 1:40 p.m. CT. During this cycle, Defendants utilized the
Layering Algorithm to place five orders, totaling 3,000 contracts. A sixth order was added at
around 1:13 p.m. CT, increasing the total to 3,600 contracts.

76. These orders represented approximately $170 million to over $200 million worth

of persistent downward pressure on the E-mini S&P price and, over the next two hours, represented

20
20-29% of the entire sell-side of the Order Book. The orders were replaced or modified more than
19,000 times before being canceled at 1:40 p.m. CT. At that time, the Order Book was severely
imbalanced and Defendants’ 3,600 Layering Algorithm orders were almost equal to the entire buy- |
side of the Order Book. In total, the Layering Algorithm was on for over four hours and 25 minutes
on May 6, 2010.

77. In addition to the Layering Algorithm, Defendants aggressively utilized the
188/289-Lot Spoofing which intensified the Layering Algorithm’s effects. Between 12:33 p.m.
CT-1:45 p.m. CT, Defendants placed a total of 135 orders with 188 or 289 lots on the sell-side of

. the Order Book, totaling 32,046 contracts. Of these 135 188/289-lot orders, 132 orders were
canceled without resulting in execution.

78. Between 1 1:17 am. CT and 1:40 p.m. CT, Defendants’ actions contributed to an
- extreme order book imbalance in the E-mini S&P market. This order book imbalance contributed
to market conditions that caused the E-mini S&P price to fall 361 basis points.

79. During this two-hour period, Defendants traded 62,077 E-mini S&P contracts with
a notional value of $3.5 billion. |

80. On May 6, 2010, Defendants caused an artificially low price to exist in the lead

month of the E-mini S&P contract.

B. Sarao’s Ongoing Spoofing

81. In October 2014, Sarao opened a personal trading account and continues to actively
trade in the E-mini S&P futures market. Sarao continues to place a very high volume of orders and
cancel nearly 90% of certain size orders, including buy orders in lot sizes 1, 2, 15, 24, and 26, often
in less than one second. During this six-month period, Sarao bought and sold over 707,000 lots in

the E-mini S&P futures contract with a total notional value exceeding $71 billion. Upon

21
information and belief, Sarao continues to enter orders in the E-mini S&P futures contract with the

intent to cancel orders prior to execution.

S&P to be artificial on at least the Example Price-Impact Days. Accordingly, Defendants violated
Sections 6(c)(3) and 9(a)(2) of the Act and Regulation 180.2.

86. Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act provides that the act, omission, or failure of any

92. _ By virtue of the foregoing, during the Relevant Period, Defendants intended to
affect or influence the intra-day contract price for the near month of the E-mini S&P during the
Relevant Period and engaged in repeated overt acts in furtherance of that intent. Accordingly,
Defendants violated Sections 6(c)(3) and 9(a)(2) of the Act and Regulation 180.2.

93. Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act provides that the act, omission, or failure of any

25
98. Since on and after July 16, 2011, Defendants have placed hundreds of thousands of

Commission Regulation 180.1, 17 C.F.R. §180.1 (2014)

(For the Period August 15, 2011 to the Present)

102. The allegations set forth in paragraphs 1 through 81 are realleged and incorporated
