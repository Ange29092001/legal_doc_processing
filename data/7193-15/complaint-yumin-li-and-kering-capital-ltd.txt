COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF
AND CIVIL MONETARY PENALTIES UNDER THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT

The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC” or “Commission”), by and
through its attorneys, hereby alleges as follows:

I. SUMMARY
l. On six trading dates from March 17, 2015 to May 6, 2015 (“Relevant Period”),

Defendant Yumin Li (“Li”) fraudulently accessed and improperly traded her employer’s account
in order to move approximately $300,000 to Defendant Kering Capital Ltd. (“Kering Capital’)
(the individual and corporation, collectively, “Defendants”). By structuring the transactions such
that her employer’s account would always buy at higher prices and sell at lower prices opposite
an account Li controlled at Kering Capital, Li was able to conduct a “money pass” between the

two accounts in favor of the Kering Capital account.
Case: 1:15-cv-05839 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/01/15 Page 2 of 14 PagelD #:2

2. By virtue of this conduct and the conduct further described herein, Defendants -
have engaged, are engaging or are about to engage in conduct in violation of (1) Sections
Ab(a)(1)(A) and (C) of the Commodity Exchange Act (“Act”), 7 U.S.C. § § 6b(a)(1)(A) and (C)
(2012), by cheating or defrauding Li’s employer through her unauthorized use of his account;
(ii) Section 4c(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 6c(a) (2012), by entering into transactions that are pre-
arranged, fictitious sales, and/or wash sales involving the purchase or sale of commodities for
future delivery; and (iii) Regulation 1.38(a), 17.C.F.R. § 1.38(a) (2014), by entering into illegal,
non-competitive transactions to buy and sell futures contracts.

3. Unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, Defendants are likely to continue to
engage in the acts and practices alleged in this Complaint and in similar acts and practices, as
more fully described below.

4, Accordingly, pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1 (2012), the
Commission brings this action to enjoin such acts and practices, prevent the dissipation of assets,
and compel compliance with the provisions of the Act. In addition, the Commission seeks civil
penalties and remedial ancillary relief, including but not limited to, trading bans, restitution,
disgorgement, an accounting, pre and post-judgment interest and such other statutory and
equitable relief as the Court may deem necessary or appropriate under the circumstances.

Il. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

5. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 6c(a) of the Act,

— 7US.C. § 13a-1(a). Section 6c(a) of the Act authorizes the CFTC to seek injunctive relief
against any person whenever it shall appear to the CFTC that such person has engaged, is
engaging or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a violation of any provision of

the Act or any rule, regulation or order promulgated thereunder.

 
Case: 1:15-cv-05839 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/01/15 Page 3 of 14 PagelD #:3

6. Venue properly lies with this Court pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
§ 13a-1(e), because Defendants transacted business in this District, and the acts and practices in
violation of the Act have occurred, are occurring or are about to occur within this District.

HI. THE PARTIES AND RELIEF DEFENDANT

7. Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an independent federal
regulatory agency that is charged by Congress with administering and enforcing the provisions
of the Act (2012) and the Commission Regulations promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. §§ 1.1 et
seq. (2014).

8. Defendant Yumin Li (“Li”) is a Chinese citizen who lived in the United States
during the relevant period. From February 2014 until May 2015 Li was employed by a trading
firm in Alamo, California to conduct research related to the futures market. Li has never been
registered with the Commission.

9, Defendant and Relief Defendant Kering Capital Limited (“Kering Capital’) is
a trading company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. Kering Capital was formed in
November 2014 by Li’s mother, who is its Chief Executive Officer and sole shareholder.
Beginning in March 2015, Kering Capital authorized Li to trade futures on its behalf. It has
never been registered with the Commission in any capacity. Kering Capital received funds that
were obtained through Li’s unlawful conduct and to which Kering Capital had no legitimate
interest or entitlement. Therefore, Kering Capital is also a Relief Defendant in this matter.

IV. FACTUAL BACKGROUND
A. Eurodollar Trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange

10. | Chicago Mercantile Exchange (“CME”) is a designated contract market located in

Chicago, Illinois that provides a marketplace for trading futures products, such as Eurodollar

futures.
Case: 1:15-cv-05839 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/01/15 Page 4 of 14 PagelD #:4

11. CME offers an electronic trading platform, CME Globex, in which traders place
various orders for futures in its order book, and CME’s matching engine arranges trades using
those orders. CME’s regular trading hours are 7:00 AM to 4:00 PM central time (“CT”), but
traders are also able to place orders in CME Globex outside of CME’s regular trading hours.
Using CME Globex, a trader is able to enter orders electronically in Eurodollar futures contracts
on weekdays during all but one hour of the day (4:00 to 5:00pm CT).

12. One trading strategy is to buy or sel! multiple Eurodollar contracts at one time in a
transaction known as a “spread.” Using a “butterfly spread,” a trader may establish positions in
Eurodollar futures contracts with three or more distinct expiration dates.

13. Eurodollar futures contracts with “distant” expiration dates that are five or more
years beyond the trade date are generally less liquid than Eurodollar contracts with earlier
“nearby” expiration dates, in that there are fewer bids to buy and offers to sell futures contracts
by market participants. In some Eurodollar contracts with expiration dates that are five or more
years beyond the trade date, there is very little trading whatsoever.

14. Generally, futures markets are price discovery markets that provide a centralized
marketplace where traders can shift risk. Price discovery occurs through the open and
competitive execution of trades on the centralized market. To protect the integrity of the price
discovery process, the Act and Regulations generally require offers to be open and available to
the market as a whole (i.e., potentially matched with any other offer). The Act and Regulations
prohibit trading practices that undermine the price discovery process, such as pre-arranged
trading or fictitious sales.

B. Li’s Control Over Two Trading Accounts
15. Li carried out a money pass by using two trading accounts held at different

registered futures commission merchants (“FCMs”).

4
Case: 1:15-cv-05839 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/01/15 Page 5 of 14 PagelD #:5

16. One trading account belonged to Li’s employer, and its account number was
XXXX8202 (“Employer 8202”). Li’s employer had a unique CME user identifier (“Tag 50”)
that allowed him to control trading within the account. Li’s employer had provided Li with his
Tag 50 for purposes of trade research; Li was not authorized to use her employer’s Tag 50 for
Eurodollar futures trading.

17. | The second account belonged to Kering Capital, and its account number was
XXXX2536 (“Kering Capital 2536”). Kering Capital opened an account at a U.S. FCM in
December 2014, and it informed the FCM that Li’s mother, Yanping Lu, would be trading for
the account. Yanping Lu was issued a unique Tag 50 for her futures trading.

18. Kering Capital authorized Li to trade on behalf of Kering Capital during the
relevant period. Li was to receive compensation in the form of commissions for profitable
trading. Li, using her mother’s Tag 50, was the only person trading Kering Capital 2536 from
March 2015 through May 2015.

C. Li’s Scheme to Siphon Money Through Eurodollar Spread Trading

19. A money pass is a form of non-competitive trading in which one trader
intentionally loses money to another trader, typically where one trader buys a quantity of
contracts at a high price opposite the other trader, and sells back the same quantity of contracts at
a low price opposite the same trader, leaving neither trader with a resulting futures or options
position (i.e., a “round turn”). What appears to the market to be a legitimate trade between two
arm’s-length parties is instead a pre-arranged scheme to move money from one account to the
other.

20. Beginning on March 17, 2015 and continuing on selected dates until May 6, 2015,
Li carried out a money pass scheme whereby she moved money from her employer’s account to

Kering Capital through a series of round-turn Eurodollar transactions at the CME. In order to

5
Case: 1:15-cv-05839 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/01/15 Page 6 of 14 PagelD #:6

ensure that her employer’s and Kering Capital’s orders would match, Li concentrated her trading
in illiquid Eurodollar contracts with expiration dates that were five or more years beyond the
trade date. In addition, she traded outside of regular CME trading hours, which meant there
would be fewer market participants trading, and she would have a better chance of matching the
orders.

21. In each of those transactions, Li would use Kering Capital 2536 to place an order
for a Eurodollar spread of a certain quantity at certain price. Li would then place a second order
using Employer 8202 on the opposite side of the market in the same product for the same
quantity and same price.

22. After the orders were matched in one transaction, Li would enter into equal and
offsetting transactions to close out the position. Li entered matched orders in this pattern on at
least March 17, 2015, March 18, 2015, March 19, 2015, April 1, 2014 and April 24, 2015, and
May 6, 2015.

23. For example, on May 6, 2015 Li entered orders for Kering Capital 2536 and
placed corresponding orders from Employer 8202 on the opposite side of the market. Between
12:42:54 AM and 12:43:05 AM CT, she entered multiple orders for Kering Capital 2536 to sell
Eurodollar butterfly spreads, which consisted of selling 600 December 2021 Eurodollar futures,
buying 1,200 September 2022 Eurodollar futures, and selling 600 June 2023 Eurodollar futures,
at a price differential of 3.0. Between 12:44:17 AM and 12:44:21 AM CT, Li entered orders for
Employer 8202 to buy an equal quantity of the same spread at the same price (3.0). Because she
entered the orders for Employer 8202 with the same quantities and prices as the orders for

Kering Capital 2536, the two accounts’ orders matched and traded opposite each other.
Case: 1:15-cv-05839 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/01/15 Page 7 of 14 PagelD #:7

24. | _Assoon as the orders were matched, Li immediately closed out the position.
Between 12:43:22 AM and 12:44:02 AM CT, she entered multiple orders for Kering Capital
2536 to buy the same quantities of Eurodollar butterfly spreads at price differentials of -1.5 and
-1.0. Between 12:44:23 AM and 12:44:34 AM CT, she entered orders for Employer 8202 to sell
the same quantities of the spread at the same prices (-1.5 and -1.0). Because she entered orders
for Employer 8202 with the same quantities and prices as the orders for the Kering Capital 2536,
and no other market participant submitted an intervening order, the two accounts’ orders
matched and traded opposite each other in full immediately after the orders for Employer 8202
were entered.

25. This particular series of transactions resulted in a $67,487.50 gain to Kering
Capital 2536, and a corresponding loss to Employer 8202.

26. Using this methodology, Li traded the accounts exclusively against each other on
CME. By placing nearly simultaneous, matching orders, trading in illiquid Eurodollar products,
and trading outside regular CME trading hours, Li virtually eliminated the possibility of trading
with any other counterparty. Indeed, during each series of orders that Li entered, Kering Capital
2536 and Employer 8202 were the only two accounts trading in the particular spread markets.

27. Kering Capital 2536 executed 41 round-turn trades opposite of Employer 8202 on
CME Globex. Each time a position was closed out, it resulted in a loss to Employer 8202 and a
gain to Kering Capital 2536. Asa result, Li was able to transfer at least $300,000 to Kering

Capital 2536.

28. Li did not execute these trades in accordance with CME’s written rules.
Case: 1:15-cv-05839 Document #: 1 Filed: 07/01/15 Page 8 of 14 PagelD #:8

29. Li intended these transactions to appear as arm’s-length transactions to the market

 

but, instead, they were part of a scheme to defraud her employer and siphon at least $300,000 to
Kering Capital 2536.
