COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,
CIVIL MONETARY PENALTY, AND OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF

 

Plaintiff United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) alleges as

follows:
I. SUMMARY
l. Beginning as early as January 2012, Joshua Gilliland and Chawalit
Wongkhiao, individually and as principals of Allied Markets LLC (“Allied Markets”)
(collectively “Defendants”), have engaged in a fraudulent scheme to solicit more than $1
million from members of the public to participate in a supposed commodity pool purportedly
trading leveraged or margined retail off-exchange foreign currency contracts, commonly

known as “forex.”

2 As part of this illegal scheme, Defendants misappropriated pool participants’

funds to pay Gilliland’s and Wongkhiao’s personal expenses. Gilliland and Wongkhiao
treated pool participants’ funds as their personal bank account, spending pool participants’
money on restaurants, entertainment, and living expenses.

3. Defendants made material misrepresentations regarding their trading expertise
and profits, and they failed to disclose to prospective and existing pool participants that only
a small portion of their funds would be used to trade forex, while the rest would be
misappropriated to pay Gilliland’s and Wongkhiao’s personal expenses and to further
Defendants’ fraudulent scheme.

4. Defendants, who have never been registered as required with the CFTC, lured
their victims into sending them funds for their purported commodity pool by fraudulently
guaranteeing specific trading returns and by representing that Defendants’ forex trading was
generating large profits. At Defendants’ direction, pool participants deposited more than
$1 million into bank accounts controlled by Defendants. When Defendants paid what they
claimed to be trading profits to pool participants or supposedly returned pool participants”
principal, they did so using money paid by other pool participants, in the manner of a Ponzi
scheme.

De By virtue of this conduct, and as more fully set forth below, Defendants have
engaged, are engaging, and/or are about to engage in acts and practices in violation of
Sections 2(c)(2)(C)(iii)(I)(ce), 4b(a)(2)(A) and (C), 4k(2), 4m(1). and 4o(1) of the
Commodity Exchange Act (“CEA”), 7 U.S.C. §§ 2(c)(2)(C)(ii)(1)(ec). 6b(a)(2)(A). (C).

5.3(a)(2)(i), (ii) (2014).

prohibits fraud in connection with any contract of sale of any commodity for future delivery

CPO, or an associated person of a CPO, by use of the mails or any means or instrumentality
of interstate commerce.

V. FACTS
18. The Relevant Period for this Complaint is January 2012 through the present.
19. During the Relevant Period, Allied Markets, by and through Gilliland and
Wongkhiao, solicited members of the public, by use of the mails and/or other means or

instrumentalities of interstate commerce, to send money to bank accounts under Defendants

uw
control for the purpose of trading agreements, contracts, or transactions in forex (foreign
currency, offered to persons who were not eligible contract participants, and offered, or
entered into, on a leveraged or margined basis) in a purported commodity pool operated by
Allied Markets.

20. By undertaking these solicitations and accepting funds for a commodity pool,
Allied Markets, by and through Gilliland and Wongkhiao, acted as a CPO.

21. Through their actions on behalf of Allied Markets. Gilliland and Wongkhiao
acted as associated persons of Allied Markets, the CPO.

22. Neither Allied Markets, Gilliland, nor Wongkhiao has ever been registered
with the CFTC in any capacity.

23. At least $1 million was deposited in accounts under Defendants’ control for
the purpose of trading forex in a purported commodity pool operated by Allied Markets.

24. During the Relevant Period, at least one pool participant did not qualify as an
“eligible contract participant,” as that term is defined by Section 1a(18) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
§ 1a(18) (2012). In addition, the purported commodity pool operated by Allied Markets was
not an eligible contract participant during the Relevant Period.

25. On numerous occasions during the Relevant Period, including in or about June
2012 and in or about July 2013, Defendants fraudulently represented to at least four
prospective pool participants that Allied Markets’ forex trading offered a safe investment

with guaranteed returns, which pool participants were due to receive on a monthly or annual

basis.
26. | Defendants knew these representations were false because, among other
things, Defendants knew that the purported commodity pool operated by Allied Markets, by
and through Gilliland and Wongkhiao, sustained overall net losses in its forex trading
account during the Relevant Period.

2h. Gilliland and Wongkhiao, acting on behalf of Allied Markets, directed at least
two pool participants to sign agreements with Allied Markets containing fraudulent
representations. These agreements guaranteed rates of return on pool participants’ principal
of seven and ten percent, respectively. The agreements also provided that pool participants
could terminate their agreement with Allied Markets and that their principal would be
refunded upon sixty days’ notice. Wongkhiao signed the agreements as a “Managing
Member” of Allied Markets.

28. While the agreements Allied Markets executed with pool participants referred
to investment returns as “interest,” Defendants communicated to pool participants that their
funds were to be pooled for trading in forex and that returns would be derived from trading
profits. At least one agreement Allied Markets executed with a pool participant expressly
stated that the pool would trade forex.

29. During the Relevant Period, Defendants’ representations prompted pool
participants to provide Defendants at least $1 million for trading forex in the purported
commodity pool operated by Allied Markets. Defendants misappropriated this money.

30. Defendants directed pool participants to send funds to bank accounts under
their control. In operating these bank accounts and accepting funds from pool participants,

Defendants made no distinction between the purported commodity pool operated by Allied
Markets and Allied Markets as the CPO, and they commingled their personal funds with
funds contributed by pool participants.

3) Gilliland and Wongkhiao, acting on behalf of Allied Markets, established a
forex trading account in the name of, and for the benefit of, Allied Markets, not for the
purported commodity pool operated by Allied Markets.

32. During the Relevant Period, the forex trading conducted by Gilliland and/or
Wongkhiao resulted in a net loss of approximately $190,000.

33. Defendants did not disclose these losses to pool participants. Rather,
Defendants knowingly misrepresented to pool participants on multiple occasions during the
Relevant Period, in person and via telephone, that Defendants’ forex trading was profitable.

34. While Defendants initially deposited some of the funds they received from
pool participants into the Allied Markets forex trading account, Defendants used only a small
portion of those funds for trading.

35, Instead of trading forex as promised, during the Relevant Period Defendants
withdrew approximately $850,000 in pool participant funds from the Allied Markets forex
trading account.

36. Using pool participants’ funds, Gilliland and Wongkhiao spent approximately
$64,000 on restaurants and entertainment, approximately $33,000 on travel, hotels. and rental
cars, and approximately $66,000 on rent for their residence in Jacksonville Beach, Florida.

Bal During the Relevant Period, Gilliland and Wongkhiao also transferred at least
$83,200 to their personal bank accounts, withdrew approximately $105,000 in cash from

automated teller machines, and withdrew approximately $34,000 in cash at bank branches.
38. Defendants also used pool participant funds to pay purported profits, to pay
other personal expenses, and to further their fraudulent scheme. Defendants failed to
disclose to pool participants that Defendants did not invest all pool participant funds as
promised,

39. During the Relevant Period, Defendants distributed approximately $48,169 in
purported gains to pool participants. Defendants represented that these payments came from
trading profits. Contrary to their representations, Defendants made these payments from the
deposits of other pool participants. in the manner of a Ponzi scheme.

40. Unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, Defendants are likely to
continue to engage in the acts and practices alleged in this Complaint and similar acts and
practices in violation of the CEA and CFTC Regulations.
