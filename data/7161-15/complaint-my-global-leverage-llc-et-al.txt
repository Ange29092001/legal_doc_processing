Plaintiff, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“Commission”), by its
attorneys, alleges as follows:
iF SUMMARY

1. From July 16, 2011, and continuing through at least November 2012 (the
“Relevant Period”), My Global Leverage, LLC (““MGL’”), by and through the actions of its
employees and agents, including, but not limited to Toney Blondo Eggleston (“Eggleston”) (

“Defendants”), offered to enter into, and conducted an office or business in the United States, for

 
Case 2:15-cv-00745 Documenti Filed 04/23/15 Page 2 of 11

the purpose of soliciting or accepting orders for the purchase or sale of precious metals from
retail customers on a leveraged or financed basis. These transactions constituted illegal, off-
exchange retail commodity transactions. By this conduct, Defendants have engaged, are
engaging, or are about to engage in conduct in violation of Section 4(a) of the Commodity
Exchange Act (“Act”), 7 U.S.C. § 6(a) (2012).

2, Eggleston controlled MGL throughout the Relevant Period and failed to act in
good faith or knowingly induced MGL’s violations alleged herein. Therefore, Eggleston is also
liable for MGL’s violations as a control person of MGL, pursuant to 7 U.S.C. § 13c(b) (2012).

3. At all relevant times, the acts and omissions of Eggleston and other MGL
representatives were committed within the scope of their employment, agency, or office with
MGL. Therefore, pursuant to 7 U.S.C. § 2(a)(1)(B) (2012) and 17 C.F.R. § 1.2 (2014), MGL is
liable as a principal for the actions and omissions of Eggleston and any other employee or agent
of MGL in violation of the Act.

4, Accordingly, pursuant to 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1 (2012), the Commission brings this
action to enjoin Defendants’ unlawful acts and practices, compel their compliance with the Act,
and further enjoin them from engaging in any commodity-related activity.

5, In addition, the Commission seeks civil monetary penalties, restitution, and
remedial ancillary relief, including, but not limited to, trading and registration bans,
disgorgement, rescission, pre- and post-judgment interest, and such other relief as the Court may
deem necessary and appropriate.

6. Unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, Defendants likely will continue

engaging in the acts and practices alleged in this Complaint and similar acts and practices, as

 
Case 2:15-cv-00745 Document1 Filed 04/23/15 Page 3 of 11

more fully described below.
Il. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

7. 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1 authorizes the Commission to seek injunctive relief against any
person whenever it shall appear to the Commission that such person has engaged, is engaging, or
is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a violation of the Act or of any rule,
regulation, or order thereunder.

8. Pursuant to 7 U.S.C, §§ 2(c)(2)(D) and 13a-1 (2012), the Commission has
jurisdiction over the conduct and transactions at issue in this case.

9, Pursuant to 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1(e), venue properly lies with this Court because
Defendants transacted business in this District, and certain transactions, acts, and practices
alleged in this Complaint occurred, or are occurring, within this District.

TH. ‘THE PARTIES

A. Plaintiff

10. _— Plaintiff U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an independent
federal regulatory agency charged by Congress with the administration and enforcement of the
Act, 7 U.S.C. §§ 1 et seq. (2012), and the Regulations promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. §§ 1.1
et seq. (2014),

B. Defendants

11. Defendant My Global Leverage, LLC is a Nevada limited liability company
formed in December 2009. MGL’s license to do business in Nevada lapsed at the end of 2012.
Its principal place of business was in Las Vegas. MGL has never registered with the

Commission in any capacity.

 
Case 2:15-cv-00745 Document1 Filed 04/23/15 Page 4 of 11

12. During the Relevant Period, Defendant Toney Blondo Eggleston was the
managing member, owner, operator, and controlling person of MGL, managing its day-to-day
operations. From 1999 to September 2012, Eggleston was registered with the Commission as an
Associated Person (“AP”) at several firms that were registered as Introducing Brokers,
Commodity Trading Advisors and Commodity Pool Operators.

IV. RELATED ENTITY

13. MGL introduced customers to Hunter Wise Commodities, LLC, a precious
metals dealer that confirmed the execution of customer precious metals transactions (“Hunter
Wise”).

14. | Hunter Wise was organized as a California limited liability company in July 2007
and was registered to do business in Nevada. It maintained business addresses in Las Vegas,
Nevada and Irvine, California, On its website, Hunter Wise held itself out as “a physical
commodity trading company, wholesaler, market maker, back-office support provider, and
finance company.” Hunter Wise purported to offer, enter into, and confirm the execution of
retail commodity transactions involving gold, silver, platinum, palladium, and copper throughout
the United States using a network of telemarketing solicitors such as MGL that Hunter Wise
referred to as “dealers.”

15, On February 19, 2014, the United States District Court for the Southern District
of Florida, granted the Commission’s motion for summary judgment finding that Hunter Wise
and other defendants violated 7 U.S.C. § 6(a), CFTC v. Hunter Wise Commodities, LLC, 1 F.

Supp. 3d 1311, 1320-22 (S.D. Fla. 2014).

 
Case 2:15-cv-00745 Document1 Filed 04/23/15 Page 5 of 11

V. STATUTORY BACKGROUND

16. 7U,S.C. § 2(c)(2)(D) gives the Commission jurisdiction over “any agreement,
contract, or transaction in any commodity” that is entered into with, or offered to, a non-eligible
contract participant (“ECP”) “on a leveraged or margined basis, or financed by the offeror, the
counterparty, or a person acting in concert with the offeror or counterparty on a similar basis”
(“retail commodity transactions”) with respect to conduct occurring on or after July 16, 2011,
subject to certain exceptions not applicable here. 7 U.S.C. § 2(c)(2)(D) makes 7 U.S.C. § 6(a)
applicable to retail commodity transactions “as if” such transactions are contracts for the sale of
a commodity for future delivery.

17. The Act defines an ECP, in relevant part, as an individual who has amounts
invested on a discretionary basis, the aggregate of which exceeds $10 million, or $5 million if the
individual enters into the transaction to manage the risk associated with an asset owned or
liability incurred, or reasonably likely to be owned or incurred, by the individual. 7 U.S.C.

§ La(18)(A)(xi) (2012).

18. 7ULS.C. § 6(a), in relevant part, makes it unlawful for any person to offer to enter
into, execute, confirm the execution of, or conduct any office or business anywhere in the United
States for the purpose of soliciting, accepting any order for, or otherwise dealing in any
transaction in, or in connection with, a contract for the purchase or sale of a commodity for
future delivery unless the transaction is conducted on or subject to the rules of a board of trade
that has been designated or registered by the Commission as a contract market.

VI FACTS

19, From July 16, 2011, and continuing through at least November 2012, Defendants

 
Case 2:15-cv-00745 Document1 Filed 04/23/15 Page 6 of 11

offered to enter into, executed, and confirmed the execution of financed precious metals
transactions with persons who were not ECPs. Defendants solicited individuals to invest in
financed precious metals transactions through Hunter Wise.

20. During the Relevant Period, MGL employed Eggleston and other individuals to,
among other things, solicit retail customers to engage in financed precious metals transactions
which constitute off-exchange retail commodity transactions.

21. Eggleston and MGL’s other employees conducted solicitations by telephone.
When soliciting customers for financed precious metals transactions, Eggleston represented that
to purchase a certain quantity of metal, the customers needed to deposit a percentage of the total
metal value, and that customers would receive a loan for the remaining amount. MGL’s website
stated that customers typically paid an initial minimum deposit of 20 to 25 percent of their metals
purchases. Hunter Wise provided the financing for the remaining balance of the purchases.
However, MGL did not disclose to at least some customers that Hunter Wise was involved in
their financed precious metals transactions.

22, After a customer invested, MGL contacted Hunter Wise to effectuate the
transaction. MGL collected the funds needed for the transaction from the customer and sent the
customer’s funds to Hunter Wise. Hunter Wise provided back office support services to MGL
and provided access to the details of the transaction to the customer via MGL’s website.

23. | MGL charged customers commissions and fees for purchasing the metal and
interest on loans to buy metal. Hunter Wise provided MGL’s share of the commissions and fees
to MGL after it received a customer’s funds from MGL,

24. | MGL’s customers did not take delivery of precious metals. Rather, most of

 
Case 2:15-cv-00745 Document1 Filed 04/23/15 Page 7 of 11

MGL’s customers were speculating on the price direction of precious metals.

25. During the Relevant Period, MGL introduced approximately 12 customers to
Hunter Wise and transferred at least $786,000 to Hunter Wise for the financing of precious
metals. During the Relevant Period, MGL received from Hunter Wise commissions and fees
totaling at least $257,680 for the retail financed precious metals transactions executed through
Hunter Wise.

26. MGL and Hunter Wise never bought, sold, loaned, stored, or transferred any
physical metals for these financed precious metals transactions. Likewise, MGL and Hunter
Wise never delivered any precious metals to any customers with respect to these financed metals
transactions.

27,  Atall times during the Relevant Period, the financed metals transactions that
MGL entered into with its customers were not made or conducted on, or subject to, the rules of
any board of trade, exchange or contract market.

28.  Atall times during the Relevant Period, Eggleston was the managing member and
owner of MGL. Eggleston exercised control over the day-to-day operations of MGL. Eggleston
was a signatory on MGL’s bank accounts and entered into agreements on behalf of MGL.

Case 2:15-cv-00745 Document1 Filed 04/23/15 Page 8 of 11

Complaint were offered and entered into by Defendants (a) on a leveraged or margined basis, or
financed by the offeror, the counterparty, or a person acting in concert with the offeror or
counterparty on a similar basis, (b) with persons who were not ECPs or eligible commercial
entities as defined by the Act, and (c) not made or conducted on, or subject to, the rules of any
board of trade, exchange or contract market.

31. The precious metals discussed in this Complaint are commodities as defined by 7
U.S.C. § 1a(9) (2012).

32, As set forth above, from July 16, 2011, until at least November 2012, Defendants
MGL and Eggleston violated 7 U.S.C. § 6(a) by offering to enter into, entering into, executing,
confirming the execution of, or conducting an office or business in the United States for the
purpose of soliciting or accepting orders for, or otherwise dealing in, transactions in, or in
connection with, retail commodity transactions.

33, Each offer to enter into, entrance into, execution, confirmation, solicitation, or
acceptance of an order for a retail commodity transaction made during the Relevant Period is
alleged in this Complaint as a separate and distinct violation of 7 U.S.C. § 6(a).

34. Eggleston directly or indirectly controlled MGL and did not act in good faith or
knowingly induced, directly or indirectly, the acts constituting MGL’s violations of 7 U.S.C. §
6(a) alleged in this Complaint. Therefore, pursuant to 7 U.S.C. § 13c(b), Eggleston is liable for
each of MGL’s violations of 7 U.S.C. § 6(a) as a controlling person of MGL.

35. ‘The acts and omissions of Eggleston and the other employees of MGL described
