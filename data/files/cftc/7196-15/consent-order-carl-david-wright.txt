an amount to be determined upon subsequent consent order or motion by the CFTC and/or
hearing before this Court.

16. The Court, being fully advised in the premises, finds there is good cause for entry

entry of Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and a permanent injunction and ancillary
equitable relief pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1, as set forth herein.

Il, FINDINGS OF FACT

17. In early 2008, Wright, who is a teacher and is also the owner of a painting
business, opened a futures trading account in his own name with a futures commission merchant
(âFCMâ) registered with the Commission. In his account application, Wright stated that his
investment objective was to speculate and that no other person would have an interest in the
account.

18. Beginning in or about August 2008, Wright began to solicit funds from friends
and acquaintances. He told some individuals that the funds were loans for his painting business
or that the funds would be used to purchase gas stations. He told other individuals that their
funds would be used to trade commodities,

19. Wright provided at least some of these individuals with documents entitled
âSpecial Renewable Note Agreementâ (âNotesâ). At least some of these Notes stated that the
funds provided would be invested in âcrude oil futures,â âgrain futures,â or âcurrency futures.â
These agreements confirmed the amount received from the participant and also specified that the
participant would receive a specific repayment, which included a profit at a stated rate of interest

varying between 10 and 30 percent. Most of these Notes had terms of no more than 2-6 months.

5

NO0G2-RLYV-DSC Document6 Filed 1o/28/13 Page 5 of 15

   

 

 
20. Wright told at least some of the participants that he was the managing partner of a
commodity pool and that he would send their funds to be traded by a firm called âCommodity
Investment Group.â Some of the Notes Wright provided to participants appeared to be printed
on âCommodity Investment Groupâ letterhead, but, in fact, Wright designed and printed those
documents on his home computer. Wright signed the Notes as the âManaging Partnerâ of the
Commodity Investment Group.

21, Regardless of what Wright told these individuals, he instructed all participants to
make their checks payable to him personally and then deposited those funds into his personal
banking account,

22. Wright did not transfer any funds to a firm named âCommodity Investment
Groupâ and Wright is not the managing partner of any such firm.

23. Wright received at least $1 million in participant funds, of which he wired
approximately $200,000 into his futures trading account. Wright did not, in fact, use most of
those funds to trade commodity futures. Instead, Wright transferred approximately $147,000
back out of his futures trading account to his bank account, often after holding the funds in the
account for only a short period of time. Wright lost approximately $60,000 in trading activities.

24. Wright used the remaining funds to pay back Pool participants in a manner of a
Ponzi scheme and to pay his own personal expenses.

25.  Wrightâs statements to Pool participants were false because he knew that he was
not trading the vast majority of the funds that he received, he knew that there was no firm called
âCommodity Investment Groupâ to which he was transferring funds, he knew that he could not

meet the terms of the promissory notes through legitimate investments, and he knew that he was

6

Case 5:13-cv-00002-RLY-DSC Document6 Filed 10/28/13 Page 6 of 15

 

 
misappropriating the majority of the funds he received to pay supposed returns to participants
and to support his lifestyle.

26. Wright used the United States Postal Service, or other private or commercial
catrier, to receive and make at least some of the payments to Pool participants.

27. On March 22, 2013, Wright was served with a search warrant by the United States
Postal Inspector and the North Carolina Bureau of Investigation. At that time, Wright gave an
informal statement in which he admitted, among other things, that he had solicited funds from
friends and acquaintances, telling at least some of them that their investments would be used to
trade commodities futures contracts, but that he had not used most of the funds to trade
commodities futures, instead using the funds to pay supposed returns to his investors. Wright
also admitted that he created the promissory Notes that he provided to some investors on his
home computer and he claimed that no one else knew that the investments were fraudulent.

Ii. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

The Court, being fully advised in the premises, finds that there is good cause for the entry
of this Consent Order and that there is no just reason for delay. The Court therefore directs the
entry of the following Conclusions of Law, permanent injunction and equitable relief pursuant to

futures.

33. Wright violated Section 40(1) of the Act, 7.U.S.C. Â§ 60(1) (2006), in that he
employed a device, scheme or artifice to defraud Pool participants and prospective Pool

operates as a fraud or deceit upon Pool participants or prospective Pool participants. These
fraudulent acts include (a) misappropriating funds invested by Pool participants; (b) providing
participants with Notes that promised a fixed return of 10-30%; (c) making material

34, Inthe course of these fraudulent acts, Wright used the mails or other
instrumentalities of interstate commerce including (a) using the United States Postal Service or
other private or commercial interstate carrier to send payments to Pool participants, and
(b) wiring funds to and from his commodity futures trading account.

35. Wright engaged in the acts and practices described above knowingly or with
