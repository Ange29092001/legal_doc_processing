I INTRODUCTION

On September 30, 2013, Plaintiff U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission (âCFTCâ or âCommissionââ) filed a Complaint against Defendants
Lions Wealth Holdings, Inc. and Lions Wealth Services, Inc., both d/b/a Lions
Wealth Capital or âLWCâ (collectively âLions Wealthâ), 20/20 Precious Metals,
Inc. (â20/20 Metalsâ), and Bharat Adatia (âAdatiaâââ) (collectively âDefendantsââ)
seeking injunctive and other equitable relief, as well as the imposition of civil
penalties, for violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (the âActââ), 7 U.S.C.
Â§Â§ 1 et seg.â Specifically, the Commission charged Defendants with violating
Sections 4(a), 4b(a)(2)(A)-(C) and 6(c)(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6(a),
6b(a)(2)(A)-(C) and 9(1) (2012), and Commission Regulation 180.1(a)(1)-(3),
17 C.F.R. { 180.1(a)(1)-(3) (2013), in connection with illegal off-exchange
transactions involving the purported purchase or sale of physical metals on a

leveraged, margined or financed basis (âRetail Commodity Transactionsâ).

 

' The Commission commenced this action in the District of Nevada. On or around December 9,
2013, that Court issued an Order transferring this case to the Central District of California.

* Effective J uly 16, 2011, Section 742 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act of 2010 (âDodd-Frank Actâ), Public Law 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376 (2010),
broadened the scope of the CFTCâs jurisdiction to include financed commodity transactions with
retail customers, including those at issue in this matter by amending Section 2(c)(2) of the Act to
create a new subparagraph, Section 2(c)(2)(D), entitled âRetail Commodity Transactionsâ.
Specifically, this broadened jurisdiction requires that financed commodity transactions with
retail customers be executed on an exchange and, among other things, subjects these transactions
to Section 4(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6(a), and the anti-fraud provisions of Section 4b of the Act,

THE PARTIES AGREE AND THE COURT HEREBY FINDS:
A. _ Findings of Fact

1. The Parties to this Consent Order

14. Plaintiff U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an
independent federal regulatory agency charged by Congress with administering
and enforcing the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1 et seg., and the Commission Regulations
promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1.1 et seg. From at least July 16, 2011
through July 31, 2012, Defendant Lions Wealth Holdings, Inc. (âLWHâ) was an
active Nevada corporation with its principal place of business in in San Juan
Capistrano, California. From at least July 16, 2011 through the present, Defendant
Lions Wealth Services, Inc. (ââLWSâ) has been an active Nevada corporation with
its principal place of business in San Juan Capistrano, California. Neither LWH
nor LWS has been registered with the Commission in any capacity.

15. From at least November 2009 through December 2012, when its
incorporation was revoked, Defendant 20/20 Precious Metals, Inc. was a Nevada
corporation. From at least July 16, 2011 through February 22, 2013, 20/20 Metals
maintained an office in San Juan Capistrano, California. 20/20 Metals has never
been registered with the Commission in any capacity.

16. Defendant Bharat Adatia, also known as Brad Adatia, resides in San

Juan Capistrano, California. Adatia is the sole officer and director of LWH and

ase 8:13-cv-01923-JLS-JPR Document 55 Filed 01/16/15 Page 8 of 37 Page ID#:5

20/20 Metals, and the president and director of LWS. Adatia managed and ran the
day-to-day operations of Lions Wealth and 20/20 Metals, including
communicating with Hunter Wise Commodities, LLC and its various subsidiaries
and related entities (collectively âHunter Wiseâ) about retail metals transactions.
Adatia was registered with the Commission in various capacities from 1996
through 2009, including as an associated person of 20/20 Trading Company, Inc.
(20/20 Tradingââ), a registered introducing broker (âIBââ), from 2000 to 2009.

2. Overview of Defendantsâ Business Model

17. Beginning on or shortly after July 16, 2011, the date Section
2(c)(2)(D) of the Act became effective, and continuing through at least
February 22, 2013 (the ârelevant timeââ), Defendants LWH and LWS, both doing
business as âLions Wealth Capitalâ or âLWCââ, through their officers, agents and
other persons acting on their behalf, including Defendant Adatia, and defendant
20/20 Metals, through its officers, agents and other persons acting on its behalf,
including Adatia, offered to enter into, entered into, confirmed the execution of,
and conducted an office and business in the United States for the purpose of
soliciting, accepting orders for, and otherwise dealing in illegal, off-exchange,
financed commodity transactions with retail customers.

18. Defendants falsely claimed to sell physical commodities, including

gold, silver, platinum, and palladium, in off-exchange transactions to retail

8

ase 8:13-cv-01923-JLS-JPR Document 55 Filed 01/16/15 Page 9of37 Page ID#:5

customers throughout the United States. Most notably, Defendants falsely claimed
to: (a) sell actual physical metals to customers; (b) make loans to customers to
purchase the physical metals; (c) transfer title of physical metals to customers; and
(d) arrange for the transfer and storage of customersâ physical metals in
independent depositories where such metal purportedly was held on the customersâ
behalf.

19. In fact, Defendants did not purchase, sell, transfer ownership of, or
arrange for storage of any physical metals in connection with the financed
commodity transactions, and Defendants never had possession of, or title to, the
physical metals they purported to purchase, sell, finance and/or transfer on behalf
of retail customers. Defendants also did not lend funds to customers to purchase
physical metals or advance or loan physical metals to customers. Rather, during
the relevant time, Defendants introduced their retail customer accounts to Hunter
Wise, a purported precious metals dealer that recorded and tracked customer orders
and trading positions. In reality, Hunter Wise did not purchase, sell, finance and/or
transfer metals in connection with Defendantsâ financed transactions, but rather
traded derivatives in its own margin accounts. Defendants knew or recklessly
disregarded that Hunter Wise did not sell or transfer ownership of any physical

metals and/or store physical metals in any depositories for or on behalf of Lions

Wealth and/or 20/20 Metals retail customers. Defendants also did not disclose
their relationship with Hunter Wise to retail customers.

20. Lions Wealth and 20/20 Metals customers were charged a
commission (up to 15% of the total metal value of a single transactions and up to
38% of the funds deposited for each transaction), a price spread (a 1.5-3% mark-up
or mark-down from the current price of the metal), interest on the purported loan
(at an annual rate of approximately 9.5%) and other fees (such as a âservice feeâ of
approximately 7% annually on the total market value of the account) for the Retail
Commodity Transactions. The customerâs equity increased or decreased as prices
of metals fluctuated, and was also subject to depletion on a daily basis by interest
and service fees. When a customerâs equity fell below 15% of the value of the
total trading position, the customer received a margin call, requiring the customer
to deposit additional funds in order to maintain the trading position. If the
customerâs equity dropped to 9% of the total value, any open trading positions
were liquidated.

21. Although no physical metal was held anywhere in the Lions Wealth or
20/20 Metals customersâ names, Lions Wealth and 20/20 Metals fraudulently
charged Lions Wealthâs and 20/20 Metalsâ customers commissions on orders for
purchasing metals, interest on non-existent loans to finance supposed metals

purchases, storage fees on non-existent metal, and other fees supposedly incurred

in connection with the purchase of physical metals. In the course of this scheme,
during the relevant time, at least 44 Lions Wealth retail customers collectively
incurred at least $1,807,712 in trading losses, commissions, interest charges and
other fees, and at least 30 20/20 Metals retail customers collectively incurred at
least $570,266 in trading losses, commissions, interest charges and other fees.

3. Defendants Knew or Recklessly Disregarding that there Was No
Metal Underlying the Retail Commodity Transactions

22. On April 26, 2011, prior to the effective date of the Dodd-Frank Act
and the broadening of the CFTCâs anti-fraud jurisdiction, the Commission filed a
civil injunctive enforcement action in the U.S. District Court for the Central
District of California against 20/20 Metals and Adatia, as well as 20/20 Trading, a
defunct entity and non-party to this action, and various individual defendants. See
CFTC v. 20/20 Trading Company, Inc. et al., Case No. SACV 11-643-JLS
(FMOx) (CD Cal.) (the âPrior 20/20 Litigationâ).

23. Inthe Prior 20/20 Litigation, the Commission charged the defendants
with committing fraud in connection with both commodity options trading and
leveraged metals sales. As to the purported sale of precious metals to retail
customers, the business model employed by 20/20 Metals and 20/20 Trading prior
to April 26, 2011, and at issue in the Prior 20/20 Litigation, was the same or

substantially similar to the business model utilized for the Retail Commodity

Transactions as more fully described herein. Ultimately, the Court found that â
prior to the broadening of the Commissionâs authority under the Dodd-Frank Act â
the Commission lacked jurisdiction over the defendantsâ leverage metals business
and dismissed those claims.

24. During the course of the Prior 20/20 Litigation, the Court appointed a
temporary receiver who filed a report on May 23, 2011. See CFTC v. 20/20
Trading, Rept. of Temporary Receiverâs Activities, Doc. No. 60. (CD Cal. May 23,
2011). Among other things, the receiver advised the Court and the parties in the
Prior 20/20 Litigation that, after reviewing documents and conducting interviews
with Adatia and representatives from Hunter Wise, among others, he was unable to
âverify the existence, ownership, and safekeeping of precious metalsâ purportedly
purchased and held in 20/20 Trading and 20/20 Metals customer accounts.

25. Adatia received and reviewed the receiverâs report, and therefore
knew or recklessly disregarded that the court appointed receiver had been unable to
identify, locate, and/or inspect any metal purportedly held on behalf of retail
customers. Nevertheless, Adatia subsequently failed to verify that any depository
held or was holding metal on behalf of 20/20 Trading, 20/20 Metals, Lions Wealth

and/or any of their customers during the relevant period of this action.

4. Defendants Solicited Customers for Illegal, Off-Exchange Retail
Commodity Transactions and Falsely Represented that Customers
Were Purchasing Actual Physical Metal

26. In connection with the Retail Commodity Transactions, Lions
Wealthâs website falsely represented that: (a) Lions Wealthâs retail customers
could purchase physical commodities, specifically gold, silver, platinum and
palladium; (b) customers purchased the âactual physical commodityâ in the âform
of either bullion bars or coinsâ, as opposed to âbuy[ing] a futures or options
contract on an underlying commodityâ; and (c) customers could elect to receive
physical metals or have Lions Wealth store metals on the customerâs behalf in âa
depository selected by LWCâ as Lions Wealth is âtied to and work[s] with experts
who understand the specifics of storing metal bullion.â Similarly, 20/20 Metalsâ
website claimed that retail customers could either take delivery of physical metals
or rely on 20/20 Metals and its âexperts who understand the specifics of storing
metal bullionâ for storage servicesââWe know how to keep your bullion safe and
sound.â The website also references the possibility of financing a metals purchase.

27.  Inaddition, Defendantsâ written marketing materials falsely
represented that in Retail Commodity Transactions customers purchased physical
metals through a financing arrangement that had âthe benefits of a âdown paymentâ
similar to those found in real estate, where you buy a propertyâ but âunlike real

estate, the non-recourse loan . . . has limited risk similar to an âoptionâ, but with no

immediate expiration date to worry about. With no ticking clock, [customers] have
an open-ended commodity transaction.â

28. Through their officers, agents and other persons acting on their behalf,
including Adatia, both Lions Wealth and 20/20 Metals knew or recklessly
disregarded that, in connection with their Retail Commodity Transactions, neither
they nor Hunter Wise purchased or sold physical metals, stored metals, delivered
metals to an affiliate, bank or depository, or lent funds to customers for the
purchase of physical metals. Defendants also knew or recklessly disregarded the
fact that there were no accounts with any metals depository holding physical
metals in the name of Lions Wealth, 20/20 Metals and/or any of their retail
customers.

5. Defendants Made Material Misrepresentations to Retail Customers
about the Purchase, Sale, Financing and Delivery of Physical Metal

29. Most, if not all, Lions Wealth customers executed the Customer
Purchase and Sale Agreement (the âPurchase Agreementâ) in which Lions Wealth
falsely represented that customers were purchasing âphysical commoditiesâ from
Lions Wealth Capital âon credit with financing provided by Lions Wealth
Service[s] Inc.â Prior to July 16, 2011, most if not all 20/20 Metals customers
executed a Purchase Agreement with 20/20 Metals that contained the same or

substantially similar provisions as those quoted herein.

30. Inthe Purchase Agreement, Defendants knowingly or recklessly
misrepresented that, within seven days of receiving a customerâs payment of the
required portion of the purchase price, they would âdeliver the commodities to
Customer, to Customerâs designee, or for the benefit of Customer to banks or
depositories used for the purpose of safekeeping Customer commodities
(collectively referred to as Bank).â Further, Defendants represented that
âOwnership of Commodities purchased by Customer, subject to any security
interest therein, passes to Customer upon delivery to Customer, Customerâs
appointed designee, or to Bank to be held for Customer,â and that âCommodities
transferred to Bank for Customer will be delivered as an undivided share of a
fungible lot and held in safekeeping on a fungible basis with the commodities of
other Bank Customers.â Finally, in the Purchase Agreement, Lions Wealth
represented that LWC (or, as applicable, 20/20 Metals) âmay utilize one or more
sources, including its own inventory, to acquire the physical commodities
necessary to fulfill its obligations to Customer.â

31. Most, if not all, Lions Wealth customers executed a Loan, Security
and Storage Agreement (the âLoan Agreementâ) with Lions Wealth in which Lions
Wealth falsely represented that LWS loans âphysical commoditiesâ or âsums of
money to purchase physical commodities, including, but not limited to, delivery to

a depository, costs, fees, storage, collateral, security interests, certain risks and

costs associated with each loan transactionâ to retail customers in exchange for a
âsecurity interestâ in all âcommoditiesâ belonging to and held on behalf of the
customer. Prior to July 16, 2011, most if not all 20/20 Metals customers executed
a Loan Agreement with 20/20 Metals that contained the same or substantially
similar provisions as those quoted herein.

32. The Loan Agreement states that â[c]ommodities transferred to Bank
for Borrower will be delivered as an undivided share of a fungible lot and held in
safekeeping on a fungible basis with the commodities of other Bank customers.â
The Loan Agreement further specifies that â[u]pon delivery of commodities on
behalf of Borrower to Bank, Borrower will receive a confirmation evidencing that
such quantity of commodities has been delivered to the depository and is being and
will continue to be held as an undivided share of the commodities so held by the
depository, on the purchaserâs behalf, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances,
other than liens of [LWS or 20/20 Metals].â

33. In fact, Defendants did not disburse any funds for the so-called âloanâ
or âfinancedâ portion of Retail Commodity Transactions, nor did Defendants ever
intend to loan or finance the Retail Commodity Transactions. Moreover, to the
extent that Hunter Wise purported to extend purchase money loans to Defendantâs
customers, such loans were a sham because Hunter Wise never obtained any

physical metal for, or delivered any such metal to, those customers.

34. Nevertheless, during the relevant time, Lions Wealth customers
collectively paid $47,161 in interest on the purported loans to retail customers and
20/20 Metals customers collectively paid $56,551 in interest on the purported loans
to retail customers in connection with Retail Commodity Transactions.

35. Further, Lions Wealth and 20/20 Metals customer account statements
reflect metal purchases and sales that were not actually made. Hunter Wise
generated the customer account statements and transmitted them to Lions Wealth
and/or 20/20 Metals, or directly to retail customers, pursuant to certain agreements
between Hunter Wise and Defendants. The customer account statements notified
retail customers of âcommodities purchasedâ, âopening buyâ, âclosing buyâ and/or
âcommodity receivedâ into the account. The statements also informed customers
that they had âloan feesâ and a loan âbalanceâ even though Defendants did not
disburse any funds for the so-called âloanâ or âfinancedâ portion of Retail
Commodity Transactions and loans purportedly extended by Hunter Wise were a
sham.

36. Defendants also falsely claimed to âshipâ or âreceiveâ metals
following each trade in Transfer of Commodity notices. The Transfer of
Commodity notices sent to retail customers included, among other provisions,

language reflecting âProduced Received into your Accountâ and a statement that

Lions Wealth âhereby confirms that a depository (âCustodianââ) authorized by

connection with, a contract for the purchase or sale of a commodity for future
delivery unless the transaction is conducted on or subject to the rules of a board of
trade that has been designated or registered by the Commission as a contract
market.

41. By the conduct described in paragraphs 14 through 36, above,
Defendants Lions Wealth and 20/20 Metals, individually and/or through their
employees and agents including Adatia, violated Section 4(a) of the Act by

43. During all relevant times, Adatia directly or indirectly controlled
Lions Wealth and 20/20 Metals, and did not act in good faith or knowingly

is therefore liable as a controlling person for the violations by Lions Wealth and
20/20 Metals to the same extent as those Defendants.

likelihood that the Defendants will continue to engage in the acts and practices
alleged in the Complaint and in similar acts and practices in violation of the Act

violation of Section 4b(a)(2)(A) and (C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6b(a)(2)(A), (C)

persons acting for Lions Wealth and 20/20 Metals occurred within the scope of
their employment, agency, or office with these entity Defendants, and are deemed
to be the acts, omissions and failures of those Defendants by operation of Section

likelihood that the Defendants will continue to engage in the acts and practices
alleged in the Complaint and in similar acts and practices in violation of the Act

61. To effect payment of the Restitution Obligation and the distribution of
any restitution payments to Defendantsâ customers, the Court appoints Melanie
Damian, Esq., as Monitor (the âMonitorââ).* The Monitor shall collect restitution
payments from Defendants and make distributions as set forth below. Because the
Monitor is acting as an officer of this Court in performing these services, the
Monitor shall not be liable for any action or inaction arising from her appointment

62. Defendants shall make Restitution Obligation payments under this
Consent Order to the Monitor in the name âLions Wealth â Settlement/Restitution
Fundâ and shall send such Restitution Obligation payments by electronic funds
transfer, or by U.S. postal money order, certified check, bank cashierâs, or bank

Regional Counsel, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 525 W. Monroe
Street, Suite 1100, Chicago, IL 60661.

63. The Monitor shall oversee the Restitution Obligation and shall have
the discretion to determine the manner of distribution of such funds in an equitable
fashion to Defendantsâ customers identified by the CFTC or may defer distribution
until such time as the Monitor deems appropriate. The Monitor shall reduce the
Restitution Obligation by amounts distributed to Defendantsâ customers in
connection with the Hunter Wise Litigation. In the event that the amount of
Restitution Obligation payments to the Monitor are of a de minimis nature such
that the Monitor determines that the administrative cost of making a distribution to
eligible customers is impractical, the Monitor may, in its discretion, treat such
restitution payments as civil monetary penalty payments, which the Monitor shall
forward to the Commission following the instructions for civil monetary penalty
payments set forth in paragraphs 70 and 71, below.

64. Defendants shall cooperate with the Monitor as appropriate to provide
such information as the Monitor deems necessary and appropriate to identify

Defendantsâ customers to whom the Monitor, in its sole discretion, may determine

Chief Financial Officer, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Three
Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20581.

other person or entity, and nothing herein shall be construed in any way to limit or
abridge the rights of any person that exist under state or common law.

67. Pursuant to Rule 71 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, each
Lions Wealth and/or 20/20 Metals customer who suffered a loss is explicitly made
an intended third-party beneficiary of this Consent Order and may seek to enforce
