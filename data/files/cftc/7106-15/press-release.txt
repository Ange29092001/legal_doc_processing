Federal Court Orders California-Based Defendants Bharat Adatia and His Companies, Lions
Wealth Holdings, Lions Wealth Services, and 20/20 Precious Metals to Pay over $5.3
Million in Monetary Sanctions for Multi-Million Dollar Fraudulent Precious Metals Scheme

Defendants Defrauded Customers of More than $2.3 Million in
Connection with Illegal Off-Exchange Precious Metals Transactions

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced that on January 16, 2015,
Judge Josephine L. Staton of the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered a Consent Order for
permanent injunction against Defendants Lions Wealth Holdings, Inc. and Lions Wealth Services, Inc. (collectively
Lions Wealth), 20/20 Precious Metals, Inc. (20/20 Metals), and their principal Bharat Adatia (aka Brad Adatia) for
fraudulently soliciting retail customers and prospective customers to enter into off-exchange trading of precious metals
on a leveraged, margined or financed basis. Adatia resides in San Juan Capistrano, California. The Defendants were also
charged in the CFTC Complaint with falsely representing that customers were purchasing actual physical metal and
issuing false account statements, among other illegal conduct (see CFTC Press Release and Complaint 6729-13,
September 30, 2013).

The courtâs Consent Order requires Lions Wealth and Adatia jointly to pay restitution of $1,773,013, and 20/20 Metals and
Adatia jointly to pay restitution of $543,227 (resulting in a combined restitution sum of $2,316,240) and requires the
Defendants to pay a civil monetary penalty totaling $3,072,490. The Order also imposes permanent trading, solicitation,
and registration bans against the Defendants and prohibits them from violating the Commodity Exchange Act and a CFTC
Regulation, as charged.

According to the CFTCâs Complaint, the Defendants falsely claimed to sell physical metals (including gold, silver,
platinum, and palladium); make loans to customers to purchase physical metals; and arrange for the storage and transfer
of customersâ physical metals to an independent depository. The Complaint further charged that the Defendants did not
sell or transfer ownership of any physical metals or disburse funds as loans and that, in fact, no metals were stored in any
depositories for or on behalf of Lions Wealth and 20/20 Metals customers. Rather, the Defendants used a portion of the
funds received from retail customers to enter into paper transactions with a third-party, Hunter Wise Commodities, LLC
(Hunter Wise) (see CFTC Press Releases 6447-12, December 5, 2012 and 6935-14, May 22, 2014).

Specifically, the Order finds that between July 16, 2011 and February 22, 2013, the Defendants falsely claimed to sell
physical metals. During that time, at least 44 Lions Wealth retail customers collectively incurred at least $1,807,712 in
trading losses, commissions, interest charges, and other fees. The Order further finds that at least 30 20/20 Metals retail
customers collectively incurred at least $570,266 in trading losses, commissions, interest charges, and other fees. The
Defendants knew or recklessly disregarded that there was no metal underlying the retail commodity transactions,
according the Order.

The Order provides that Melanie Damian, Esq. is responsible for collecting restitution and making any distributions to
Lions Wealth and 20/20 Metals customers. Ms. Damian was appointed by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District
of Florida as Special Monitor, Corporate Manager, and Equity Receiver in the CFTCâs enforcement action against Hunter
Wise and certain of its associated entities.

The CFTC cautions victims that restitution orders may not result in the recovery of money lost because the wrongdoers
may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers and to
ensure the wrongdoers are held accountable.

The CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this action are Elizabeth N. Pendleton, Melissa
Glasbrenner, Joseph Konizeski, William P. Janulis, Scott Williamson and Rosemary Hollinger.
