ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTIONS 6(c) AND 6(d) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, MAKING
FINDINGS AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

I.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ) has reason to believe that
on June 14, 2010, June 15, 2010, December 10, 2010, April 12, 2013, April 15, 2013, and
December 11, 2013, (the âRelevant Datesâ), Daniel Bowman (âBowmanâ or âRespondentââ)
violated Section 4a(e) of the Commodity Exchange Act (the âActââ), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6a(e) (2012).
Therefore, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest that public
administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted to determine whether Respondent
engaged in the violations set forth herein and to determine whether any order should be issued
imposing remedial sanctions.

IT.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Respondent has
submitted an Offer of Settlement (âOfferââ), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Without admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, Respondent consents to
the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 6(c) and 6(d) of the
Commodity Exchange Act, Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (âOrderâ) and
acknowledges service of this Order,'

 

' Respondent consents to the entry of this Order and to the use of these findings in this

proceeding and in any other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission
is a party; provided, however, that Respondent does not consent to the use of the Offer, or the

 
TI.
The Commission finds the following:
A, SUMMARY

On three trading days in 2010, and three trading days in 2013, Respondent exceeded the
spot month speculative position limit for the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. (âCMEâ) Live
Cattle futures contract. In 2013 Respondent controlled the trading of a company named Four
Aces Investment Group, LLC (âFour Acesâ), On the trading days of the position limit violations
in 2013, the aggregate futures position held by Four Aces and Respondent exceeded the spot
month speculative position limit in the Live Cattle futures contract.

B. RESPONDENT

Respondent Daniel Lee Bowman (âBowmanâ) resides in Lisle, Illinois, and was
registered with the Commission as a Floor Broker from January 1, 1982 until June 10, 2014.
Bowman was the Agent and Manager of Four Aces, an IIlinois limited liability company. In
2012, Bowman reported that he controlled the trading of Four Aces on his Commission Form 40
âStatement of Reporting Trader.â Bowman retired as a floor broker in June of 2014.

C, FACTS

The trading of the Live Cattle futures and options on futures contracts is subject to
speculative position limits established by the CME and approved by the Commission. During
the Relevant Dates, the Live Cattle futures position limit in the spot month was 450 contracts as
of the close of business on the first business day following the first Friday of the contract month
until the close of business on the business day preceding the last five business days of the
contract month. Any person desiring to own or control a position in excess of the speculative
position limits was required to obtain an exemption from the CME. Respondent did not obtain
an exemption that would permit the accounts for which he traded to hold Live Cattle futures
positions in excess of the CMEâs limits.

In 2010, Respondent exceeded the CME Live Cattle futures contract speculative position
limit on three days. Respondentâs long positions in the June 2010 Live Cattle futures contract
were as follows: 546 contracts on June 14, 2010, which exceeded the position limit by 96
contracts; and 506 contracts on June 15, 2010, which exceeded the position limit by 56 contracts.
Respondentâs long position in the December 2010 Live Cattle futures contract was 483 contracts
on December 10, 2010, which exceeded the position limit by 33 contracts.

 

findings or conclusions in this Order consented to in the Offer, as the sole basis for any other
proceeding brought by the Commission, other than in a proceeding in bankruptcy or to enforce
the terms of this Order. Nor does Respondent consent to the use of the Offer or this Order, or the
findings or conclusions in this Order consented to in the Offer, by any other party in any other
proceeding.

 
In 2013, the aggregate net futures position of Four Aces and Respondent exceeded the
CME Live Cattle futures contract speculative position limit on three days, The aggregate net
short futures positions held by Four Aces and Respondent in the April 2013 Live Cattle futures
contract were as follows: 512 contracts on April 12, 2013 and April 15, 2013, which exceeded
the position limit by 62 contracts, and 462 contracts later in the day on April 15, 2013, which
exceeded the position limit by 12 contracts. The aggregate net long futures position held by Four
Aces and Respondent in the December 2013 Live Cattle futures contract was 463 contracts on
December 11, 2013, which exceeded the position limit by 13 contracts. Bowmanâs ill-gotten
gross profits from trades that exceeded the position limits were $ 34,940.01.

IV.
LEGAL DISCUSSION

Section 4a(e) of the Act, in relevant part, makes it unlawful for any person âto violate any
bylaw, rule, regulation, or resolution of any contract market, derivatives transaction execution
facility, or other board of trade licensed, designated, or registered by the Commission ... fixing
limits on the amount of trading which may be done or positions which may be held by any
person under contracts of sale of any commodity for future delivery or under options on such
contracts or commodities, if such bylaw, rule, regulation, or resolution has been approved by the
Commission.â 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6a(e) (2012).

CME is a registered entity as defined by 1a(40) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1a(40) (2012), and
a designated contract market for the Live Cattle futures contract pursuant to Section 5 of the Act,
7 U.S.C, Â§ 7 (2012). The Commission approved the CMEâs speculative position limit for the
Live Cattle futures contract in February 2003.

CME rules set a speculative position limit in the Live Cattle futures contract of 450
contracts long or short in the expiring contract month as of the close of business on the first
business day following the first Friday of the contract month until the close of business on the
business day preceding the last five business days of the contract month. CME Rule 10102.E.

Commission Regulation 150,5(g) provides, in relevant part, that, â[i]n determining
whether any person has exceeded the limits established under this section, all positions in
accounts for which such person by power of attorney or otherwise directly or indirectly controls
trading shall be included with the positions held by such person.â 17 C.F.R. Â§ 150.5(g) (2015),
The CMEâs aggregation rule similarly provides that the position limits apply to âall positions in
accounts for which a person by power of attorney or otherwise directly or indirectly owns the
positions or controls the trading of the positionsâ in determining whether that person has exceed
the position limits. CME Rule 559.D.

Respondent controlled the trading of the Live Cattle futures contract for Four Aces on the
dates of the position limit violations in 2013. Pursuant to CME Rule 559.D, the positions held
by Four Aces were required to be aggregated with Respondentâs positions for purposes of
applying CMEâs speculative position limits for the Live Cattle futures contract.

 
By exceeding the CME position limit for the Live Cattle futures contract on three trading
days in 2010, and on an aggregated basis on three trading days in 2013, Respondent violated
Section 4a(e) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6a(e) (2012). The plain language of Section 4a(e) of the Act
unambiguously imposes liability for violations of designated contract market position limit rules
such as those at issue here. Saberi v. CFTC, 488 F.3d 1207, 1212 (9th Cir. 2007) (rejecting a
traderâs contention that the Commission was required to prove that he intended to violate the
speculative limits in frozen pork bellies futures set forth in CME Rule 8302.E (citing CFIC y.
Hunt, 591 F.2d 1211, 1218 (7th Cir. 1979)). Exceeding position limit rules is sufficient to
constitute a violation of Section 4a(e) of the Act; the Commission does not need to establish
scienter, or intent to violate position limits, in order to prove a violation. Saberi, 488 F.3d at
1212 n. 4; Ant, 591 F.2d at 1218.

FINDINGS OF VIOLATION

Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that, during the Relevant Dates,
Respondent violated Section 4a(e) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6a(e) (2012),
