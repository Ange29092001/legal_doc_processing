ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTIONS 6(c) AND 6(d) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, MAKING
FINDINGS AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

I.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ) has reason to believe that
BNP Paribas Securities Corp. (âBNPPâ or âRespondentââ) violated Commission Regulations
(âRegulationsâ) 1.25(b)(3)()(F) and 1.25(b)(3)Gi)(D). Therefore, the Commission deems it
appropriate and in the public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are,
instituted to determine whether BNPP engaged in the violations set forth herein and to determine
whether any order should be issued imposing remedial sanctions.

IT.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, BNPP has submitted an
Offer of Settlement (âOfferâ), which the Commission has determined to accept. Without
admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, BNPP consents to the entry of
this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 6(c) and 6(d) of the Commodity
Exchange Act, Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (âOrderâ) and acknowledges
service of this Order.â

 

' â BNPP consents to the entry of this Order and to the use of these findings in this proceeding

and in any other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party;
provided, however, that BNPP does not consent to the use of the Offer, or the findings or
conclusions in this Order consented to in the Offer, as the sole basis for any other proceeding
brought by the Commission, other than in a proceeding in bankruptcy or to enforce the terms of
this Order. Nor does BNPP consent to the use of the Offer or this Order, or the findings or
conclusions in this Order consented to in the Offer, by any other party in any other proceeding.

III.
The Commission finds the following:
A. SUMMARY

On three occasions in or about November and December 2014 (the âRelevant Periodâ),
BNPP violated the Commissionâs Regulations governing concentration limits applicable to the
investment of segregated commodity customer funds. BNPP reported two of the violations to
the Commission. An additional violation was discovered in connection with a review by
BNPPâs designated self-regulatory organization, CME Group Inc. None of the violations
resulted in customer losses.

B. RESPONDENT

BNP Paribas Securities Corp. is a financial services firm organized under the laws of
Delaware with its principal office located in New York, New York. It is registered with the
Commission as a Future Commission Merchant (âFCMâ) and is an approved Swap Firm and
National Futures Association Member.

Cc. FACTS

As an FCM, BNPP receives money, securities, and other property from its customers
(âcustomer fundsâ) to margin, guarantee, or secure the customersâ trades in commodity futures,
options and certain derivatives contracts. FCMs are required to segregate customer funds from
funds belonging to the FCM, and can only invest customer funds in investments enumerated in
Regulation 1.25, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.25 (2013). See 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6d(a)(2). Regulations 1.25(b)(3)(i)(F)
and 1.25(b)(3)(ii)(D), 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1.25(b)(3)(i)(F), 1.25(6)(3)1)(D) (2013), establish asset-
based and issuer-based concentration limits for investments of segregated customer funds in
money market mutual funds (ââMMMFsâ).

During the Relevant Period, BNPP invested segregated customer funds in a manner
prohibited by Regulations 1.25(b)(3)(i)(F) and 1.25(b)(3)(i)(D).

On November 20, 2014, BNPP invested more than 10 percent of segregated customer
funds in an individual MMMF in violation of Regulation 1.25(b)(3)(1i1)(D) and more than 50
percent of segregated customer funds in MMMFs in violation of Regulation 1.25(b)(3)(i)(F).
BNPP maintained books and records reflecting total assets held in segregation as well as
investments into MMMFs. BNPPâs employees manually entered MMMF investments into its
books and records, and BNPP had a process to calculate whether BNPP was compliant with
Regulations 1.25(b)(3)(i)(F) and 1.25(b)(3)(ii)(D). BNPPâs employee erroneously entered the
amount of the investment into MMMFs as an amount less than the amount actually invested.
The manual error caused BNPPâs books and records to reflect incorrectly that the investment was
compliant with applicable concentration limits. At the end of the day, BNPP discovered that it
was in violation of Regulation 1.25(b)(3)(ii)(D), and on the following day, November 21, BNPP
reported its violation to the Commission.

On November 28, 2014, BNPP invested segregated customer funds in an individual
MMMF, and the investment exceeded 10 percent of total assets held in segregation in violation
of Regulation 1.25(b)(3)(11)(D). BNPPâs employee entered the total assets held in segregation as
approximately $1.158 billion when, in fact, the segregated account only held assets of
approximately $1.054 billion. This error caused BNPPâs books and records to reflect incorrectly
that BNPPâs prior investment of $110 million of customer segregated funds in an MMMF was
still allowable, whereas the maximum allowable investment was $105.4 million. BNPP
maintained an investment of customer segregated funds in an individual MMMF which breached
the applicable concentration limits. BNPP failed to discover this violation. BNPPâs designated
self-regulatory organization, CME Group, discovered this violation on or about December 19,
2014.

On December 5, 2014, BNPP invested more than 50 percent of segregated customer
funds in MMMFs in violation of Regulation 1.25(b)(3)(i)(F). The assets held in segregation and
BNPPâs investments in the MMMFs were entered correctly into BNPPâs books and records, and
BNPPâs existing process reflected non-compliance with applicable concentration limits.
However, BNPPâs employee making the investments failed to detect that the investments in
MMMFs exceeded the applicable concentration limits contained in Regulation 1.25(b)(3)(i)(F).
On the next business day, December 8, BNPP discovered that it was non-compliant and reported
it to the Commission.

In accepting BNPPâs Offer, the Commission recognizes BNPPâs cooperation during the
investigation by the staff of the Division of Enforcement. The Commission also recognizes that
BNPP voluntarily undertook remedial action to strengthen its policies and procedures related to
compliance with Regulations 1.25(b)(3)(i)(F) and 1.25(b)(3)Gi)(D).

The Commission also notes that the civil monetary penalty imposed on BNPP reflects
BNPPâs early resolution of this matter.

IV.
LEGAL DISCUSSION

Section 4d(a)(2) of the Commodity Exchange Act (âActâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6d(a)(2) (2013),
provides that customer funds âmay be invested in obligations of the United States, in general
obligations of any State or of any political subdivision thereof, and in obligations fully
guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States, such investments to be made in
accordance with such rules and regulations and subject to such conditions as the Commission
may prescribe.â Regulation 1.25(a) contains a list of permissible investments in which FCMs

 

? During the CFTCâs investigation, BNPP discovered that it was in violation of Regulation
1.25(b)(3)(11)(D) at the time of the manual error by BNPPâs employee.
may lawfully invest customer funds, including MMMFs, and Regulation 1.25(b) sets forth the
requirements for managing âpermitted investments consistent with the objectives of preserving
principal and maintaining liquidity,â including establishing asset-based and issuer-based
concentration limits. 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.25 (2013).

Regulation 1.25(b)(3)(1)(F) establishes an asset-based concentration limit for direct
investment of segregated customer funds in MMMFs, stating in relevant part, that âinvestments
in money market mutual funds . . . may not exceed 50 percent of the total assets held in
segregation by the [FCM].â 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.25(b)(3)(i)(F).

Regulation 1.25(b)(3)(ii)(D) establishes issuer-based concentration limits for direct
investments of segregated customer funds in MMMFs, stating in relevant part, that â[i]nterests in
any individual money market mutual fund described in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(F) of this section may
not exceed 10 percent of total assets held in segregation by the [FCM].â 17 C.F.R. Â§
1.25(b)(3)(ii)(D).

On November 20 and 28, 2014, BNPP violated the concentration limit set forth in
Commission Regulation 1.25(b)(3)(4i1)(D) relating to its investment of segregated customer funds
in an individual MMMF, and on November 20 and December 5, 2014, BNPP violated the
concentration limit set forth in Commission Regulation 1.25(b)(3)(i)(F) relating to its investment
of segregated customer funds in MMMFs. Each and every day that BNPP maintained segregated
customer funds in an individual MMMF or in MMMFs in violation of Commission Regulation
1.25(b)(3)()(F) or 1.25(b)(3)ii)(D) constitutes a separate and distinct violation.

V.
FINDINGS OF VIOLATION

Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that, during the Relevant Period, BNPP
violated Commission Regulations 1.25(b)(3)(i)(F) and 1.25(b)(3)(i1)(D), 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§
1.25(b)(3)()(F), 1.25(6)(3)Gi)(D) (2013).
