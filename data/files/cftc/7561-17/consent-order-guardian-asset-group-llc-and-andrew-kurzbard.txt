ase O:15-cy-81354-KAM Docurent22 Entered on PLSD Docket O5/22/2017 Page Sofis

monetary penalty, and other equitable relief pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1
(2012), as set forth herein.
THE PARTIES AGREE AND THE COURT HEREBY FINDS:
A. Findings of Fact
(D Parties to this Consent Order

14. Plaintiff U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an independent federal
regulatory agency that is charged by Congress with administering and enforcing the Act, 7
US.C. Â§Â§ 1-26 (2012), and the Regulations promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1.1 â 190.10
(2016).

15. Defendant Guardian Asset Group, LLC is a Florida limited liability company
formed in 2012. Guardian was administratively dissolved in September 2014. Guardian was a
telemarketing firm that solicited retail customers to engage in financed transactions in precious
metals. Guardianâs principal place of business was West Palm Beach, Florida. Guardian has
never been registered with the Commission in any capacity.

16. Defendant Andrew Kurzbard is an individual whose last known address was in
Hacksneck, Virginia. Kurzbard was an owner, principal, and controlling person of Guardian,
overseeing its day-to-day operations. Although Kurzbard was at one time registered with the
Commission as an associated person, he is not currently, and was not from February 2012
through at least February 2013 (the Relevant Period), registered with the Commission in any
capacity.

(2) Other Relevant Entities
17. AmeriFirst Management LLC is a Florida limited liability company formed in

October 2011. AmeriFirst operated throughout the United States using a network of over 30
ase O:15-cy-81354-KAM Docurent22 Entered on PLSD Docket O5/22/2017 Page Gof1s

solicitation firms referred to as âdealers,â including Guardian. AmeriFirst held itself out as a
precious metals wholesaler and clearing firm, claiming to provide customer financing options for
precious metals dealers like Guardian. During the Relevant Period, Amerifirst purported to
confirm the execution of precious metal transactions that customers executed through precious
metals dealers such as Guardian. AmeriFirst ceased operations on February 25, 2013.

18, On September 17, 2013, a court in this District, in an action captioned CFTC v.
AmeriFirst Management LLC, No. 13-cv-61637-WPD (S.D. Fla. Sept. 17, 2013) (ECF No. 17),
entered a consent order against AmeriFirst, finding that it violated Sections 4(a), 4b(a)(2), 4d(a),
and 6(c)(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6(a), 6b(a)(2), 6d(a), and 9(1) (2012). In the consent order,
AmeriFirst neither admitted nor denied its violations of the Act.

(3) Defendantsâ Illegal Financed Precious Metals Business

19. During the Relevant Period, the Defendants solicited members of the general
public through various means, including but not limited to, an internet website, promotional
materials, and telephone calls. The Defendants solicited potential retail customers to purchase
physical metals, including gold, silver, and platinum, on a leveraged, margined, or financed
basis. Although Guardian also offered precious metals on a fully-paid basis, the vast majority of
its business involved off-exchange financed metals transactions.

20. Defendantsâ solicitations included representations that customers should deposit a
percentage of the total metal value, and secure a loan for the remaining amount, in order to
purchase more metal through leverage. Guardian introduced its customers to AmeriFirst, which

provided the financing for the loans to the customers.
ase O:15-cy-81354-KAM Document 22 Entered on PLSD Docket O5/22/2017 Page 7 ofig

21. After a customer invested, Guardian contacted AmeriFirst to carry out the
transaction. Guardian collected the necessary funds and sent them to AmeriFirst. AmeriFirst, in
turn, provided back office support services and customer access to the details of the transaction.

22. For the financed precious metals transactions, Guardian charged customers
commissions, storage and other fees, and interest on loans. AmeriFirst initially provided
Guardianâs share of the commissions and fees to Guardian after it received the customer funds
from Guardian. Later in the relationship, Guardian deducted the commissions and fees before
forwarding the customer funds to AmeriFirst.

23. None of Guardianâs financed precious metals customers took actual delivery of
precious metals in connection with the Retail Commodity Transactions at issue. Guardianâs
customers neither possessed nor controlled any physical metals as a result of these Retail
Commodity Transactions.

24, Neither Guardian nor AmeriFirst bought, sold, loaned, stored, or transferred any
physical precious metals as part of the Retail Commodity Transactions at issue. Neither
Guardian nor Amerifirst actually delivered any physical precious metals to any retail-
commodity-transaction customers.

25. At least some, if not all, of Defendantsâ financed-precious-metals-transaction
customers did not qualify as âeligible contract participantsâ as defined in 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1a(18)(xi)
(2012).

26. Defendantsâ financed precious metals transactions were not conducted on or
subject to the rules of a board of trade which has been designated by or registered with the

CFTC.
ase O:15-cy-81354-KAM Docurent22 Entered on PLSD Docket O5/22/2017 Page 8 orig

27. During the Relevant Period, Guardian collected at least $1,714,107 from its retail-
commodity-transaction customers. At least $434,413.54 of that amount was retained by
Guardian as commissions, storage or other fees, or interest charges.

28. In addition to overseeing Guardianâs day-to-day operations as an owner and
principal, Defendant Andrew Kurzbard had signatory authority over Guardianâs bank accounts.
Kurzbard also had the authority to bind Guardian in contractual agreements, and to hire and fire
employees. Finally, Kurzbard not only solicited customers himself, but he managed Guardian

employees who solicited customers to finance their purported precious metals purchases.

B. Conclusions of Law
@ Jurisdiction and Venue
29. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7

U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2012), which provides that whenever it shall appear to the Commission that any
person has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a
violation of any provision of the Act or any rule, regulation, or order promulgated thereunder, the
Commission may bring any action in the proper district court of the United States against such
person to enjoin such act or practice, or to enforce compliance with the Act, or any rule,
regulation, or order thereunder.

30. The Commission has jurisdiction over the solicitations and transactions at issue in
this action pursuant to Section 2(c)(2)(D) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(c)(2)(D) (2012).

31. | Venue properly lies with this Court pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
Â§ 13a-1(e) (2012), because Guardian resides in this jurisdiction and the acts and practices in

violation of the Act occurred within this District.

(2) Violations of Section 4(a) of the Act â Off-Exchange Retail Precious Metals
Transactions

32. Under Section 4(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6(a) (2012), it is unlawful for any
person to offer to enter into, execute, confirm the execution of, or conduct any office or business
anywhere in the United States for the purpose of soliciting, accepting any order for, or otherwise
dealing in any transaction in, or in connection with, a contract for the purchase or sale of a
commodity for future delivery unless the transaction is conducted on or subject to the rules of a
board of trade that has been designated or registered by the Commission as a contract market.

33. During the Relevant Period, Defendantsâ Retail Commodity Transactions
described in the Complaint (ECF No. 1), and this Consent Orderâs Findings of Fact, were offered
and entered into (a) on a leveraged or margined basis, or financed by the offeror, the
counterparty, or a person acting in concert with the offeror or counterparty on a similar basis;
(b) with persons who are not eligible contract participants or eligible commercial entities as
defined by the Act; and (c) the transactions were not made or conducted on, or subject to, the
rules of any board of trade, exchange, or contract market.

34. By offering and entering into these Retail Commodity Transactions, Defendants
violated Section 4(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6(a) (2012).

35. The foregoing acts, omissions, and failures of Kurzbard and other employees of
Guardian occurred within the scope of their employment, agency, or office with Guardian.
Pursuant to Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(a)(1)(B) (2012), and Regulation 1.2, 17
C.F.R. Â§ 1.2 (2016), these acts, omissions, and failures are deemed those of Guardian, which is

liable as principal for these acts, omissions, and failures.
Case 9:15-cv-81354-KAM Document22 Entered on FLSD Docket 05/22/2017 Page lO of ig

(3) Violations of Section 4d(a) of the Act â Failure to Register as a Futures
Commission Merchant

36. Section 4d(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6d(a) (2012), makes it unlawful for any
person to be a Futures Commission Merchant (FCM) unless such person shall have registered
with the Commission as an FCM.

37. During the Relevant Period, Guardian, through Kurzbard and other employees,
acted as an FCM by soliciting and accepting orders for Retail Commodity Transactions without
registering with the Commission as an FCM. By doing so, they violated Section 4d(a) of the
Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6d(a).

38. The foregoing acts, omissions, and failures of Kurzbard and other employees of
Guardian occurred within the scope of their employment, agency, or office with Guardian.
Pursuant to Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(a)(1)(B) (2012), and Regulation 1.2, 17
C.F.R. Â§ 1.2 (2016), these acts, omissions, and failures are deemed those of Guardian, which is
liable as principal for these acts, omissions, and failures.

(4) Kurzbard Controlled Guardian

39. Kurzbard directly or indirectly controlled Guardian and knowingly induced,
directly or indirectly, the acts constituting Guardianâs violations of Section 4(a) and 4d(a) of the
Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6(a) and 6d(a) (2012). Kurzbard is therefore liable for those violations as a
controlling person pursuant to Section 13(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13c(b) (2012).

40. Unless restrained and enjoined by the Court, there is a reasonable likelihood that
Defendants Guardian and Kurzbard will continue to engage in the acts and practices alleged in

the Complaint and in similar acts and practices in violation of the Act.

the execution of, or conducting any office or business for the purpose of soliciting, accepting any

purchase or sale of a commodity for future delivery not conducted on or subject to the rules of a
board of trade that has been designated by or registered with the Commission as a contract
market, in violation of Section 4(a) and 4d(a), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6(a) and 6d(a) (2012).

provided for in Regulation 4.14(a)(9), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 4.14(a)(9) (2016).
V. RESTITUTION AND CIVIL MONETARY PENALTY
A. Restitution
43, Guardian and Kurzbard shall pay restitution in the amount of four hundred thirty
four thousand four hundred thirteen dollars and fifty four cents ($434,413.54) (Restitution
Obligation), plus postjudgment interest. Postjudgment interest shall accrue on the Restitution
Obligation beginning on the date of entry of this Consent Order and shall be determined by using
the Treasury Bill rate prevailing on the date of entry of this Consent Order pursuant to 28 U.S.C.
Â§ 1961 (2012). Guardian and Kurzbard are jointly and severally liable for the Restitution
Obligation.
44. To effect payment of the Restitution Obligation and the distribution of any
restitution payments to Defendantsâ customers, the Court appoints the National Futures
Association (NFA) as Monitor. The Monitor shall collect restitution payments from the

Defendants and make distributions as set forth below. Because the Monitor is acting as an

12
Case 9:15-o-81354-KAM Documert22 Entered on FLSD Docker O5/22/eG1? Pade 13 af 1S

officer of this Court in performing these services, the NFA shall not be liable for any action or
inaction arising from NFAâs appointment as Monitor, other than actions involving fraud.

45. Defendants shall make Restitution Obligation payments under this Consent Order
to the Monitor in the name âGuardian Asset Group LLC and Andrew Kurzbard
Settlement/Restitution Fundâ and shall send such Restitution Obligation payments by electronic
funds transfer, or by U.S. postal money order, certified check, bank cashierâs check, or bank
money order to the Office of Administration, National Futures Association, 300 South Riverside
Plaza, Suite 1800, Chicago, Illinois 60606, under cover letter that identifies the paying
Defendant and the name and docket number of this proceeding. Defendants shall simultaneously
transmit copies of the cover letter and the form of payment to the Chief Financial Officer,
Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street, NW,
Washington, D.C. 20581.

46. | The Monitor shall oversee the Restitution Obligation and shall have the discretion
to determine the manner of distribution of such funds in an equitable fashion to Defendantsâ
customers identified by the CFTC or may defer distribution until such time as the Monitor deems
appropriate. In the event that the amount of Restitution Obligation payments to the Monitor are
of a de minimis nature such that the Monitor determines that the administrative cost of making a
distribution to eligible customers is impractical, the Monitor may, in its discretion, treat such
restitution payments as civil monetary penalty payments, which the Monitor shall forward to the
CFTC following the instructions for civil monetary penalty payments set forth in Paragraph 53
below.

47. Defendants shall cooperate with the Monitor as appropriate to provide such

information as the Monitor deems necessary and appropriate to identify Defendantsâ customers

13
Case 9:15-cv-81354-KAM Document22 Entered on FLSD Docket 05/22/2017 Page ld of ig

to whom the Monitor, in its sole discretion, may determine to include in any plan for distribution
of any Restitution Obligation payments. Defendants shall execute any documents necessary to
release funds that they have in any repository, bank, investment, or other financial institution,
wherever located, in order to make partial or total payment toward the Restitution Obligation.

48. The Monitor shall provide the Commission at the beginning of each calendar year
with a report detailing the disbursement of funds to Defendantsâ customers during the previous
year. The Monitor shall transmit this report under a cover letter that identifies the name and
docket number of this proceeding to the Chief Financial Officer, Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20581.

49, The amounts payable to each customer shall not limit the ability of any customer
from proving that a greater amount is owed from Defendants or any other person or entity, and
nothing herein shall be construed in any way to limit or abridge the rights of any customer that
exist under state or common law.

50. Pursuant to Rule 71 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, each customer of
Defendants who suffered a loss is explicitly made an intended third-party beneficiary of this
Consent Order and may seek to enforce obedience of this Consent Order to obtain satisfaction of
any portion of the restitution that has not been paid by Defendants to ensure continued
compliance with any provision of this Consent Order and to hold Defendants in contempt for any
violations of any provision of this Consent Order.

51. To the extent that any funds accrue to the U.S. Treasury for satisfaction of
Defendantsâ Restitution Obligation, such funds shall be transferred to the Monitor for

disbursement in accordance with the procedures set forth above.

one thousand six hundred twenty dollars and thirty one cents ($651,620.31) (CMP Obligation),

on the date of entry of this Consent Order and shall be determined by using the Treasury Bill rate
prevailing on the date of entry of this Consent Order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1961 (2012).
