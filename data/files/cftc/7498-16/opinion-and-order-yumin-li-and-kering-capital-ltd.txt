OPINION AND ORDER

Plaintiff U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCFTCâ) filed a complaint
against Defendants Yumin Li and Kering Capital, Ltd. (âKeringâ), alleging that Li and Kering
violated the Commodity Exchange Act (â the Actâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6b(a)(1)(A) and (C), 7 U.S.C.
Â§ 6c(a), and 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.38(a), when Li cheated or defrauded Liâs employer, Tanius
Technology (âTaniusâ), by entering into pre-arranged, fictitious trades of futures contracts
designed to transfer money from Tantus to Kering. CFTC now moves for summary judgment,
seeking to permanently enjoin Defendants from further violations of the Act, permanently enjoin
Li from trading in the futures markets, and permanently enjoin Kering from granting Li access to â
its futures trading accounts and from relying upon Li for trading advice and direction. CFTC
also asks the Court to impose a civil monetary penalty of $901,387.50, jointly and severally
against the Defendants. Finally, CFTC requests that the Court order restitution to Tanius in the

amount of $300,462.50, plus post-judgment interest.
Case: 1:15-cv-05839 Document #: 82 Filed: 12/09/16 Page 2 of 23 PagelD #:957

Because the undisputed facts establish that Li engaged in illegal fictitious trades in order
to fraudulently transfer funds from Tanius to Kering and did so in the scope of her employment
with Kering, the Court grants the CFTCâs motion for summary judgment. The Court orders Li
and Kering to return $300,462.50, plus post-judgment interest, to the Tanius Account and to pay
a civil penalty of $901,387.50. The Court enjoins Li from working in the futures markets for
five years and permanently enjoins Li from future violations of the Act. The Court enjoins

_ Kering from employing Li to do any work related to the futures markets for five years and
permanently enjoins Kering from future violations of the Act.

CFTC also moves to strike [65] the declaration of Nicolas Morgan in opposition to the
motion for summary judgment [56], the declaration of Dr. Tiago Duarte-Silva [5 a and Liâs
Response to the Joint Statement of Undisputed Material Factsâ [58]. Li subsequently withdrew
the declaration of Dr. Duarte-Silva, but she continues to object to the exclusion of her Response
and the Morgan declaration. Because the Response does not comply with the Courtâs standing
order on summary judgment procedures and the Morgan declaration puts forth irrelevant and
inadmissible evidence, the Court grants CFTCâs motion to strike.

BACKGROUNDâ
A. Relevant Parties

1. Yumin Li

Tanius, a California based trading firm, employed Li from February 2013 until May
2015. Tanius hired Li because she had expertise in Eurodollar and other types of trading. While

employed at Tanius, Li received a total of $931,140.21. According to her employment

 

' Li filed an amended Response to the Joint Statement of Undisputed Material Facts [72]. The Court
treats the motion to strike as applicable to this amended Response.

* The facts in this section are derived from the Joint Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (âJSOFâ),
Doc. 46. All facts are taken in the light most favorable to Li and Kering Capital, the non-movants.

2
Case: 1:15-cv-05839 Document #: 82 Filed: 12/09/16 Page 3 of 23 PagelD #:958

agreement, Li was not authorized to trade any securities or financial instruments for herself or
any other entity without authorization from Tanius.

Li contends that while at Tanius, she was treated unfairly relating to the margin and risk
limits on her trading activities. Li also felt that Tanius did not appropriately compensate her and
thus, she faciliated the trades described below in order to obtain compensation which she
believed Tanius owed to her.

Li accepted a position as a trader at Kering in November 2014 while still employed atâ
Tanius. At Kering, Li was the only person trading futures for Kering and held sole responsibility
for developing Keringâs futures trading strategies.

Prior to her employment at Tanius, Li had worked periodically as a Eurodollar trader for
five years. Li has a masterâs degree in statistics and a bachelorâs degree in business
administration.

2. Kering Capital Limited

Kering is a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. Yanping Lu, Liâs
mother, formed Kering in November 2014. Lu is the Chief Executive Officer of Kering.
Keringâs sole business activity is trading; its only business asset is the trading account ending in
2536 (âKering Accountâ). During the relevant timeframe, Li was a probationary trader for
Kering, but she expected to receive compensation from Kering for profitable trading and she
expected to be hired by Kering if she generated enough profit.

3. Tanius Technology LLC

Tanius is a California-based trading firm. One of Taniusâ founders, Gary Middlemiss,
was Liâs supervisor at Tanius. While working at Tantus, Li had access to Middlemissâ trading

account ending in 8202 (âTanius Accountâ).
Case: 1:15-cv-05839 Document #: 82 Filed: 12/09/16 Page 4 of 23 PagelD #:959

B. Trading at Issue

Beginning on March 17, 2015 and continuing until May 6, 2015, Li used the Tanius
Account to engineer a series of trades designed to benefit Kering. Li structured 41 trades over
six Separate occasions such that the Tantus Account would always buy futures from the Kering
Account at higher prices and sell those same futures back to Kering at lower prices (or in the Â©
reverse order in some circumstances) completing what is known as a âround-turn trade.â
Regardless of the order of the transaction, each transaction resulted in unidirectional profits to
Kering at the expense of Tanius. Over the course of these 41 transactions, Li successfully
transferred $300,462.50 from the Tanius Account to the Kering Account. Li was not authorized
by Middlemiss or anyone else at Tanius to enter into any of these 41 transactions and she was not .
authorized to enter into any transactions that obviously would result in a loss for Tanius.

Li always placed these orders outside of normal trading hours in illiquid futures
marketsâtypically Eurodollar futures with expiration dates more than five years in the future.
She would enter an order with one account and then, within seconds, enter an identical order
with the other account on the opposite side of the trade. For example, on May 6, 2015 , between
12:42:54 AM and 12:43:05 AM (a nine-second window), Li entered orders on the Kering
Account selling a total of 2400 futures with three different expiration dates. Then, between
12:44:17 AM and 12:44:21 AM, Li entered orders on the Tanius Account to buy the exact same
quantities of those futures at the exact price she offered them on the Kering Account. These
orders matched and the exchange executed the trade. Li then immediately closed out the position
by doing essentially the same transaction in reverse, this time entering an order to buy the same
2400 futures with the Kering Account and selling them from the Tanius account, but this time at

a lower price. Again the orders matched and the exchange executed the trade. The total time
Case: 1:15-cv-05839 Document #: 82 Filed: 12/09/16 Page 5 of 23 Pagelb #:960

elapsed from the moment Li entered the first order until she closed out the position was one
minute and forty seconds, during which time she transferred $67,487.50 from the Tanius
Account to the Kering Account. Each of the other round-turn trades Li executed between the
Tanius Account and the Kering Account resulted in a loss to Tanius and a gain to Kering.

By engaging in these trades outside of regular business hours, placing nearly
simultaneous orders in illiquid products, Li was able to virtually assure that she would not trade
with a third party, and eliminated any market risk to her transaction. During each of her trades,
the Kering Account and Tanius Account were the only two accounts trading in the selected
markets.

C. Discovery of the Trading and Subsequent Action

On May 6, 2015, Middlemiss noticed that trading had occurred in the Tanius Account
that had caused a significant loss on the account. Middlemiss asked Li about the trades and she
admitted to executing the trades. That same day, Li fled to China where she remains to this day.
Li has expressed her intention to return to the United States and continue trading for Kering after
the conclusion of this case.

Kering did not authorize Li to engage in illegal transactions, and Lu was not aware that
Li conducted trades on behalf of Kering by controlling the Tanius Account and directing trades
favoring Kering with that account.

D. Freezing of the Kering Account

On July 2, 2015; the Court entered an order freezing the assets in the Kering Account.

The parties consented to a preliminary injunction extending the freeze for the duration of the

case on July 23, 2015.

LEGAL STANDARD

Summary judgment obviates the need for a trial where there is no genuine issue as to any
material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56.
To determine whether a genuine issue of fact exists, the Court must pierce the pleadings and
assess the proof as presented in depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions, and
affidavits that are part of the record. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 & advisoty committeeâs notes. The party
seeking summary judgment bears the initial burden of proving that no genuine issue of material
fact exists. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265
(1986). In response, the non-moving party cannot rest on mere pleadings alone but must use the
evidentiary tools listed above to identify specific material facts that demonstrate a genuine issue
for trial. Id. at 324; Insolia v. Philip Morris Inc., 216 F.3d 596, 598 (7th Cir. 2000). Although a
bare contention that an issue of fact exists is insufficient to create a factual dispute, Bellaver v.
Quanex Corp., 200 F.3d 485, 492 (7th Cir. 2000), the Court must construe all facts in the light
most favorable to the non-moving party and draw all reasonable inferences in that partyâs favor.

ANALYSIS

A. Motion to Strike

CFTC moves to strike the declaration of Nicolas Morgan in opposition to the motion for
summary judgment, the declaration of Dr. Tiago Duarte-Silva, and Liâs Response to the J SOF.

I. Morgan Declaration

The declaration of Nicolas Morgan contains irrelevant information and several citations
to prior CFTC decisions. CFTC does not move to strike the decision citations, only the

irrelevant information contained in paragraphs 2-4 and 10. Declarations offered in support ofa
Case: 1:15-cv-05839 Document #: 82 Filed: 12/09/16 Page 7 of 23 PagelD #:962

motion for summary judgment must âset out facts that would be admissible in evidence.â Fed.
R. Civ. P. 56(c)(4). The Morgan Declaration sets out the following statements that CFTC seeks
to strike for presenting irrelevant information:

2. I contacted counsel for Tanius on March 4, 2016 at 4:08
PM and on March 15, 2016 at 10:38 PM via email.

3. In these two emails, I asked Taniusâ counsel to confirm
whether they would provide my client, Li, with her W-2 for 2015.

4. I never received a response to either of these emails.

10. =â In addition, as part of the courtesy copy of the filing that I
have provided to the Court, I have also provided a CD containing
an audio recording produced by the CFTC in this action, bates- _
stamped as CFTC-Li-0001748. This recording is an interview
conducted by the CME of Gary Middlemiss. Ms. Li relied on this
recording in preparing the transcript that is attached to her
concurrently-filed declaration as Exhibit I.

Doc. 56 Ff 2-4, 10. In her response to the motion to strike, Li offers no argument regarding the
Morgan Declaration or why it is admissible. The Court finds that the four challenged paragraphs
contain irrelevant information and therefore strikes them and does not consider them in
conjunction with the motion for summary judgment.

2. Li Response

CFTC seeks to strike Liâs Response to the JSOF in its entirety because it fails to comply
with the Courtâs summary judgment procedure and because it offers inadmissible and irrelevant
information.

The Courtâs summary judgment procedure requires all undisputed facts be included in the
joint motion for undisputed facts. The additional facts Li seeks to put before the Court do not
appear to be disputed, therefore they are not properly before the Court. The Court's procedures

are not advisory; therefore, the Court strikes these facts. See Sweatt v. Union Pac. R.R. Co., 796

7
Case: 1:15-cv-05839 Document #: 82 Filed: 12/09/16 Page 8 of 23 PagelD #:963

F.3d 701, 711-12 (7th Cir. 2015) (affirming this Courtâs summary judgment case management
procedures as conforming to Local Rule 56.1); Ciomber v. Coop. Plus, Inc., 527 F.3d 635, 643
(7th Cir. 2008) (district court does not abuse its discretion âwhen it opts to disregard facts
presented ina manner that does not follow [Local Rule 56.1âs] instructionsâ).

Even if the Court considered these facts, they do not help Liâs case. Li argues in her
Response that the facts she presents may be considered for purposes of determining the
appropriate remedy. But her Response to the JSOF does not add any information the Court finds
useful even if it were admissible. For example, in the âRemedies Factsâ section of her Response,
Li provides the following response to paragraph 13 of the JSOF:

14. Although Tanius paid Li $931,140.21 during her employment
at Tanius, she was still undercompensated because Tanius broke
certain promises made to Li in the Employment Agreement and

otherwise mistreated her in ways that required her to undertake
additional expenses or receive reduced compensation.

15. In addition, Tanius broke promises made to Li to increase her
net profits based contingent compensation to 50%, instead of the
20-30% outlined in the Employment Agreement, which
significantly reduced Liâs compensation.

Doc. 72 4f 14-15. This response is typical of Liâs failure to comprehend the nature of her
violation and unwillingness to accept responsibility. The fact that she had an employment
dispute with her employer does not justify or mitigate the theft of over $3 00,000 from her
employer or her abuse of the commodities market to carry out that theft. It does show, however,
that she has not internalized the wrongfulness of her conduct and is likely to repeat it in the
future. The remainder of her Response is in a similar vein. The Court thus strikes the Response

for failure to comply with the Courtâs summary judgment procedures and for lack of relevance.
Case: 1:15-cv-05839 Document #: 82 Filed: 12/09/16 Page 9 of 23 PagelD #:964

3. Dr. Duarte-Silva Declaration

Finally, CFTC moves to strike the declaration of Dr. Duarte-Silva. Li subsequently
withdrew this declaration, therefore, the Court denies as moot CFTCâs motion to strike the
declaration.

B. Liability

1. Unauthorized Trading and Misappropriation Claim (Count I) -

CFTC first contends that Li committed fraud and misappropriated funds in violation of
Â§ 4b of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6b. CFTC claims that Li cheated or defrauded her employer, Tanius,
by engaging in unauthorized trades of Eurodollar futures on behalf of Tanius, which were _
structured in such a way as to shift money from Tanius to Kering. A party violates Â§ 4b if, in
connection with any order to make any on-exchange futures contract for another person, the
party cheats, defrauds or attempts to cheat or defraud the other person, or the party willfully
deceives or attempts to deceive the other person by any means in regard to any such order or
contract. 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6b(a)(1)(A),(C).

Between March 17, 2015 and May 6, 2015, Li engaged in pre-arranged trades of
Eurodollar futures contracts between accounts she controlled that were owned by Tanius and
Kering. Li engaged in these trades with the sole purpose of moving money from Tanius to
Kering, and she ultimately succeeded in transferring $3 00,462.50 from Tanius to Kering by way
of these fictitious trades. These trades were designed to result in financial losses for Tanius and
financial gains for Kering. Li made these trades without the knowledge or authorization of her
employer, Tanius. Furthermore, while she was generally permitted to trade Eurodollar futures on
Taniusâ account, she was not authorized to engage in trades which were structured to create a

loss for Tanius. Li undertook these trades willfully because she believed that Tanius owed her
Case: 1:15-cv-05839 Document #: 82 Filed: 12/09/16 Page 10 of 23 PagelD #:965

money and that executing these trades was the only way she would receive the money she
believed they owed her. This conduct establishes a violation of Â§ 4b.

Li argues that the Court should deny the motion for summary judgment on Count I -
because there is a dispute as to whether she was authorized to trade Eurodollar futures. This
argument falls flat, however. It is not material whether or not Li was authorized to trade
Eurodollar futures as a general matter, and CFTC does not dispute that she was. The issue is
_ whether Tanius authorized her to engage in fictitious trades designed to siphon money from
Tanius to Kering. They did not. Included with the Joint Statement of Undisputed Facts is a list
of all 41 improper trades Li structured on behalf of Tanius and Kering. The parties do not
dispute that âLi was not authorized by Middlemiss to enter into the Eurodollar transactions
identifiedâ in that list and that she was ânot authorized by Middlemiss to enter into any
transaction that would obviously result in a loss.â* Doc. 46 at Â§ 53. Her authorization to trade
Eurodollars merely provided the means for her to commit this deception; it did not create
immunity from liability.

Li also argues that the Â§ 4b claim should be thrown out because the mechanism by which
she engaged in the fraud, a âmoney pass,â is prohibited by Â§ 4c(a) of the Ac, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6c(a),
under which CFTC is also seeking relief in this matter. Li argues that the Â§ 4b and Â§ 4c claims
are âentirely duplicativeâ and therefore the enforcement of the Â§ 4b claim would render Â§ 4c
| superfluous. Doc. 55 at 9. This again is incorrect. Sections 4b and 4c are not duplicative.

Section 4b prohibits taking money from another party in a deceptive manner, in relation to a

 

3 In her Amended Response to the JSOF, Li states that she did not need to seek permission prior to
conducting specific trades, that her trade restrictions were margin and position-based, and she was
authorized to trade Eurodollar futures. Doc. 72 at ff 10-12. Even if the Court did not strike the
Response, these assertions have no bearing on whether or not she was authorized to engage in trades |
designed to steal money from Tanius. If anything, they illustrate the amount of trust that Tanius put in

her, which she subsequently betrayed.
10
Case: 1:15-cv-05839 Document #: 82 Filed: 12/09/16 Page 11 of 23 PagelD #:966

futures contract, whereas Â§ 4c prohibits fictitious trades of futures contracts whether done to
commit a fraud or not. Here, Li happened to have used a money pass as the method of carrying
out her fraud, but engaging in a money pass is not always a fraud nor is a fraud always a
violation of Â§ 4c. The elements of the two offenses are distinct and it is possible to violate one
without the other. If, for example, Li had engaged in the money pass transactions with
Middlemissâ approval, that would have been a violation of Â§ 4c but not Â§ 4b. Therefore, Â§ 4b is |
not duplicative of Â§ 4c.

There is no dispute that Li knowingly engaged in fictitious trades of Eurodollar futures
using the Tanius account and without the knowledge or approval of her managers at Tantus in
order to transfer money from Tanius to Kering. Thus, CFTC is entitled to summary judgment on
the Â§ 4b claim.

2. Fictitious Sales of Eurodollar Futures (Count I)

CFTC alleges that in the process of carrying out her misappropriation of Tanius funds, Li
engaged in a Series of pre-arranged, fictitious trades with the Kering Account she also controlled
in violation of Â§ 4c of the Act. 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6c(a). Li does not contest her liability under Â§ 4c in
her Response, but this does not end the Courtâs inquiry; the Court still must determine whether
CFTC has established that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Keeton v.
Morningstar, Inc., 667 F.3d 877, 884 (7th Cir. 2012).

Section 4c makes it unlawful for any person to enter into the execution of a transaction Â©
that is a fictitious sale. 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6c(a). A fictitious sale is one which uses pre-arranged trades
that give the appearance of submitting trades to the open market but is protected from market
risk and price competition. Jn the Matter of Solomon Mayer, CFTC No. 92-21, Comm. Fut. L.

Rep. P 27,259, 1998 WL 39411, at *21 (Feb. 3, 1998). Pre-arranged trades are fictitious sales

11
Case: 1:15-cv-05839 Document #: 82 Filed: 12/09/16 Page 12 of 23 PagelD #:967

because â[b]y determining trade information such as price and quantity outside the pit, then
using the market mechanism to shield the private nature of the bargain from public scrutiny, both
price competition and market risk are eliminated.â CFTC v. Moncada, 31 F. Supp. 3d 614, 617
(S.D.N.Y. 2014) (quoting Harold Collins, [1986-87 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep.
(CCH), J] 22,982 at 31,903 (C.F.T.C. April 4, 1986), rev'd on other grounds sub nom. Stoller v.
CFTC, 834 F.2d 262 (2d Cir. 1987)). These trades are made with the intent to avoid taking a
genuine position in the market. Reddy v. CFTC, 191 F.3d 109, 115 (2nd Cir. 1999). An
individual violates Â§ 4c when she enters such a trade intentionally. Jd. at 119. CFTC need not
establish motive, but evidence of motive strengthens the inference of intent. Jd.

Here, Li engaged in 41 round-turn trades which involved trading outside of normal
trading hours, in low-volume contracts. A typical transaction would involve Li placing an order
for a quantity of Eurodollar contracts at a certain price using the Kering Account. She would
then place a second order using the Tanius Account on the opposite side of the market (e.g.,
buying with the Kering Account and selling with the Tanius Account) for the same product,
quantity, and price. After these orders were matched and the trade completed, Li then entered
into an offsetting transaction in which she would enter an order to sell the same quantity of
Eurodollar futures from the Kering Account and an order to buy the same quantity from the
Tanius Account closing out the position taken in the first trade. Li placed the orders for Tantus
and Kering nearly simultaneously and outside of normal trading hours, typically after midnight,
effectively eliminating any risk of trading with a third party. These facts are sufficient to show
that Li intentionally engineered and engaged in trades that were designed to give the appearance

of taking place on the open market, while in reality structured to avoid market risk. This is

12
Case: 1:15-cv-05839 Document #: 82 Filed: 12/09/16 Page 13 of 23 PagelD #:968

sufficient to establish a violation Â§ 4c and the Court grants CFTC summary judgment on Count
II.

3. Violation of CFTC Regulation I .38(a) (Count ITD)

CFTC alleges that Li violated Regulation 1.38(a), which requires that all purchases and
sales of futures be executed âopenly and competitively,â by engaging in the round-turn trades
described above. Conduct that violates Â§ 4c also violates Reg. 1.38(a). Moncada, 31 F. Supp. 3d
at 617. Li did not include any response to this allegation in her Response to the motion for |
summary judgment. For the reasons stated above regarding Â§ 4c, the Court grants the CFTC
summary judgment on Count III.

4, Vicarious Liability of Kering

CFTC seeks to hold Kering vicariously liable for Liâs violations of Â§Â§ 4b and 4c and
Regulation 1.38(a) because she was acting as Keringâs agent when she committed the violations.
The Act holds principals strictly liable for violations of the Act carried out by their agents when
those agents were acting within the scope of their employment. See 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(a)(1)(B);
Stotler & Co. v. CFTC, 855 F.2d 1288, 1292 (7th Cir. 1988). The principal is liable even if it did
not participate in or know of the violation. Jd. Kering does not dispute that it employed Li
during the relevant period; the only question is whether Li was acting within the scope of her
employment or furtherance of her agency when engaging in the illegal transactions. Rosenthal &
Co. v. CFTC, 802 F.2d 963, 966-67 (7th Cir. 1986).

Whether an employee was acting within the scope of her employment is a question of
fact and turns âon an overall assessment of the totality of the circumstances in each case.â

In the Matter of Gary Glass & Zoltan (Lou) Guttman, CFTC No. 93-4, Comm. Fut. L. Rep. P

26,787 1996 WL 518121, at *9 (Sept. 11, 1996) (quoting Berisko v. E. Capital Corp., [1984â-

13
Case: 1:15-cv-05839 Document #: 82 Filed: 12/09/16 Page 14 of 23 PagelD #:969

1986 âTransfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) {| 22,772 at 31,223 (CFTC 1984)). Where
there is no dispute as to any material fact regarding whether the employee was acting within the
scope of her employment, the Court may decide the issue as a matter of law. See, e.g., CFTC v.
Schafer, No. CIV.A. H-96-1213, 1997 WL 33547409, at *7 (S.D. Tex. Dec. 23, 1997).

There is no dispute that as part of her employment with Kering, Li had broad authority to
engage in futures trading on the Kering Account. She was the only trader working for Kering at
that time and she was solely responsible for developing, overseeing, and executing the futures
trading strategy on behalf of Kering. She engaged in each of the illegal trades using the Kering
Account and with the purpose of transferring money to Kering. Trading in commodity futures Â©
for the benefit of Kering is exactly why Kering employed Li and the illegal acts in which she
engaged were squarely within this scope.

Kering argues that it never authorized Li to engage in the illegal trades and therefore she
was acting outside of her authority.â It is irrelevant, however, whether or not Kering authorized
Li to engage in the illegal trades. Mast v. Best Commodities Servs., Inc., [1986-1987 Transfer
Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. Â§ 23,380 at 33,038-33,039 (CFTC Dec. 2, 1986) (liability of
principal not defeated by claims that agent was not authorized to act fraudulently). If an
employer could avoid liability simply by not affirmatively authorizing illegal conduct, Â§ 2(a)

would be rendered a nullity. Thus, this argument fails.

 

* It is significant that Kering failed to take any action that an employer typically does once the employer
learns that an employee has âgone rogue.â Kering did not fire Li, immediately return the funds to Tantus,
or cooperate with the investigation. Instead, Kering attempted to withdraw the Tanius funds from its
account once Tanius discovered the fraud and continues a willingness to work with Li, as evidenced by
Liâs assertion that she intends to return to the United States and trade futures on Keringâs behalf. These
facts lead to the inference that while Kering may not have authorized Liâs fraudulent conduct beforehand,
it certainly appears to have ratified the fraudulent conduct once discovered, thus undermining Keringâs
âgone rogueâ argument. |

Case: 1:15-cv-05839 Document #: 82 Filed: 12/09/16 Page 15 of 23 PagelD #:970

Kering finally argues that it cannot be held liable because it is a retail customer, not a
registered futures merchant. Kering offers no case law or statutory support for this argument,
simply concluding, âIt is wrong to punish an unsophisticated client because the expert trader it
retained engaged in wrongdoing.â Doc. 70 at 4. The language of Â§ 2(a) is broad, and extends
vicarious liability to âany individual, association, partnership, corporation, or trust.â 7 US.C.

Â§ 2(a)(1)(B). There is no language limiting its applicability to registered futures merchants or
exempting retail customers. Therefore, the Court finds Kering is not exempt from vicarious
liability under Â§ 2(a).

The undisputed facts, supported by admissible evidence, establish that Li violated Â§Â§ 4b
and 4c as well as Regulation 1.38 as a matter of law. Additionally, because the undisputed facts
demonstrate that Li was acting within the scope of her employment with Kering when
conducting the illegal trades in question, Kering is vicariously liable for Liâs violations pursuant
to Â§ 2(a). Therefore, the Court grants CFTC summary judgment as to liability on Counts I, II,
and III. The Court turns next to the appropriate remedy.

C. Â© Remedy

CFTC seeks disgorgement of the ill-gotten gains from Kering, a civil penalty of three-
times the ill-gotten gains jointly and severally from Li and Kering, a permanent injunction
banning Li from interacting in any way with the commodities market, a permanent injunction on
Kering enjoining it from directly or indirectly granting Li access to its commodity futures trading
accounts or allowing Li to control or direct commodity futures trading on behalf of Kering, and a
permanent injunction on both Li and Kering restraining them from future violations of the Act.
For the reasons stated below, the Court finds that disgorgement of all ill-gotten gains, a civil

penalty equal to three-times the ill-gotten gains, a five-year trading ban on Li, a five-year

15
Case: 1:15-cv-05839 Document #: 82 Filed: 12/09/16 Page 16 of 23 PagelD #:971

injunction on Kering interacting with Li in any way regarding commodity futures trading, and a
permanent injunction on both Li and Kering Capital restraining them from violating the Act is
appropriate in this case.

1, Disgorgement

CFTC seeks disgorgement of $300,462.50 from the Kering Account. Neither Kering nor
Li object to disgorgement of these funds. The Court has authority to order disgorzement to
further the purpose of the Act. See CFTC v. Co Petro Mktg. Grp., Inc., 680 F.2d 573, 584 (9th
Cir. 1982) (holding that it would frustrate the regulatory purposes of the Act ifa violator were
allowed to keep his ill-gotten gains). Therefore, the Court orders Defendants to return the
$300,462.50, plus post-judgment interest, to the Tanius Account or in the alternative authorizes
the Futures Commission Merchant holding the Kering Account to release the frozen funds
directly to the Tanius Account.

2 Civil Penalty

CFTC seeks a civil penalty against Defendants equal to three times their illicit gainsâ
$901,387.50. Under the Act, CFTC may seek a maximum civil penalty of up to three times the
ill-gotten gains or $140,000 for each violation whichever is greater. 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(d)(1); 17
C.F.R. Â§ 143.8(a)(2). The fine amount must also be ârationally related to the offense.â
Monieson v. CFTC, 996 F.2d 852, 864 (7th Cir. 1993). The Court looks to three factors to
determine if the fine is rationally related to the offense: (1) the nature of the violations, (2) the
injury caused by the violations, and (3) penalties used in similar cases. Jd.

The nature of the violations is fraud and fictitious trades. Li repeatedly engaged in illegal
pre-arranged trades, intentionally designed to take money from her employer, Tanius, and
transfer it to Kering without incurring any market risk. She did this in a manner designed to

evade detection and spread over six separate occasions. This is a severe violation and one that

16
' Case: 1:15-cv-05839 Document #: 82 Filed: 12/09/16 Page 17 of 23 PagelD #:972

cuts to the heart of the purpose of the Act: to protect âall market participants from fraudulent or
other abusive sales practices and misuses of customer assets.â 7 U.S.C Â§ 5(b).

The injury caused by the violations is $300,462.50 transferred from Tanius to Kering.
Furthermore, Liâs actions have undermined public confidence in the commodities markets. This
harm is more insidious and damaging than the stolen funds themselves. Congress created CFTC
to promote efficiency, transparency, and fairness in the commodities markets and when a trader
fraudulently steals money from her employer and engages in pre-arranged trades, it harms the
public trust in the markets, which Congress has set out to promote and protect. See CFTC v.
Sarvey, No. 08 C 192, 2012 WL 426746, at *6 (N.D. Ill. Feb. 10, 2012). Therefore, this is a
serious offense, meriting a serious penalty.

Courts in similar cases have imposed civil penalties equal to three times the ill-gotten
gains, and in some cases, at the statutory maximum. In CFTC v. Garofalo, No. 10-CV-2417,
2011 WL 4954082, at *7 (N.D. II. May 5, 2011), the court imposed a civil penalty of three times
the ill-gotten gains. The defendant in that case engaged in conduct similar to that of Li. Over
the course of one evening, the defendant participated in 119 fictitious sales between his account
and that of an investment firm over which he had obtained control. His efforts resulted in a loss Â©
of $614,925 for the victim and an equal gain for himself. Jd; see also CFTC v. Brockbank, 505
F. Supp. 2d 1169, 1177 (D. Utah 2007), aff'd, 316 F. Appâx 707 (10th Cir. 2008) (imposing the
âhighest possibleâ civil penalty where the defendant engaged investor fraud); CFTC v. Sarvey,
No. 08 C 192, 2012 WL 426746, at *6 (N.D. Ill. Feb. 10, 2012) (imposing civil penalty equal to
three times the ill-gotten gains where two traders engaged in fictitious sales to fraudulently

transfer money from one traderâs clients to the personal account of the second trader).

17
Case: 1:15-cv-05839 Document #: 82 Filed: 12/09/16 Page 18 of 23 PagelD #:973

In cases where the only charged offense was a violation of Â§ 4c, courts have routinely
imposed civil penalties approximately equal to the amount of the ill-gotten gains. See, e.g.,
CFTC v. Singhal, Case No. 12-cv-00138; Doc. 32 (N.D. Ill. Nov. 28, 2012) (imposing a civil
penalty of $140,000 where defendant transferred $118,868.75 between two accounts using
fictitious trades). But here, Li did not only violate Â§ 4c, she also violated Â§ 4b, and thus Singhal
and other simple Â§ 4c cases are not helpful comparators. A penalty equal to three times the ill-
gotten gains is not out of step with cases in which a defendant defrauded a customer and engaged
in pre-arranged sales as occurred here.

In arguing for a lower penalty Li states that the Court should consider the following

factors when setting the fine:

(1) the seriousness of the violations as determined by the
relationship of the violation to the regulatory purpose; (11) whether
the violation was an isolated mistake arising from an ambiguous
statutory duty or from circumstances that are unique or
unforeseeable; (iii) the particular mitigating and aggravating
circumstances presented by the unique facts of the conduct at
issue; (iv) any benefit to the violator; (v) any harm to the investors;
(vi) any attempt to cure the violations; (vii) post-violation conduct;
(viii) cooperation with authorities; and (ix) any attempt to provide
restitution.

Doc. 55 at 10-11. Li contends that in light of these factors,â the Court should impose a minimal .
penalty or no penalty at all. Li proceeds to go through each of her proposed factors in turn. The
Court declines to evaluate each factor individually, but addresses Liâs argument in its entirety.
As noted above, Liâs violations strike at the central purpose of the regulatory framework
Congress has devised around the commodities market, to protect âall market participants from

fraudulent or other abusive sales practices and misuses of customer assets.â 7 U.S.C Â§ 5(b). Yet

 

5 Li refers to these factors as the âLevy factor[s],â in reference to CFTC v. Levy, 541 F.3d 1102 (11th Cir.
2008), but it is not clear why. These factors are not contained in Levy, and the court in Levy affirmed a
civil penalty well in excess of three times the ill-gotten gains. The Court indulges Li and addresses these
factors, despite her pointing to no valid authority requiring the Court to do so.

18
Case: 1:15-cv-05839 Document #: 82 Filed: 12/09/16 Page 19 of 23 PagelD #:974

Li argues that her conduct does not implicate a core provision of the Act and âat worst, involved
money pass transaction and not price manipulation or fraud.â Doc. 55 at 11. The Court
disagrees. Li illegally transferred over $300,000 from her employerâs account to another account
controlled by her and owned by her mother. She did 50 without her employerâs knowledge or
consent, in a manner designed to avoid detection. She engaged in this behavior on six separate
occasions over two months. This is not a simple money pass case, and Liâs suggestion to the
contrary is confusing at best.Â°

Liâs violations did not result from any unique circumstances. She argues that she engaged
in the illegal trades because the hostile work environment at Tanius drove her to think that
_ âexecuting these trades was the only way in which she would receive the compensation that she
believed Tanius owed to her.â Doc. 55 at 14-15 (quoting Doc. 46 J 76). While the allegations |
of mistreatment are concerning, they do not provide a mitigating basis for her conduct. Li
provides no citation in support of the contention that this constitutes unique, mitigating
circumstances. Her argument is essentially that her employers at Tanius were exceedingly cruel
to her and they broke the law too: therefore, she should not be punished for breaking the law. If
what Li alleges about her treatment at Tanius is true, she had numerous legitimate options to
address her mistreatment that did not involve violating the Act.

Li next presents several arguments that can only be described as misguided and
unhelpful. First she argues that she did not benefit from the trading because of the asset freeze
the Court placed on the assets in the Kering Account. She argues in the alternative that if the

Court determines she did benefit from the illegal trades, âthose funds represented monies that

 

Â° Li also argues that she did not know at the time that the transactions were wrongful. This is perhaps the
most preposterous claim of all. The Court finds it difficult to believe that someone as well educated,
privileged, and having as much family support as Li does not understand the basic concept, as taught to
children around the globe, that it is wrong to steal and lie.

19
Case: 1:15-cv-05839 Document #: 82 Filed: 12/09/16 Page 20 of 23 PagelD #:975

Ms. Li believed were owed to her by Tanius and Middlemiss.â Doc. 55 at 15. Liis wrong on
all points. First, the mere fact that CFTC was able to act quickly enough to freeze the assets
before she could obtain them does not absolve her of her theft. Second, the funds did not belong
to her, she stole them. If Li had a legal claim to the money, she should have pursued it in court.
This argument demonstrates Liâs abj ect failure to take responsibility for her actions and in no
way mitigates her behavior.

Li makes additional arguments about why she should not be penalized for her actions, but
they are all similarly unhelpful. Because Li has provided no compelling legal or factual
argument as to why a civil penalty of three-times the ill-gotten gains is inappropriate in this case,
the Court imposes a civil penalty of $901,387.50 against Li and Kering, jointly and severally.â

3. Injunction Against Li

CFTC seeks a lifetime trading ban in the commodity futures market as well as a
permanent injunction against future violations of the Act against Li. An injunction is appropriate
where a violation has occurred and there is a reasonable likelihood of future violations. CFTC v.
Hunt, 591 F.2d 1211, 1220 (7th Cir. 1979). The Court should consider the totality of the
circumstances when determining whether future violations are likely to occur. Jd. The Court
should look at the egregiousness of the conduct, the isolated or recurrent nature of the infraction,
the degree of scienter involved, the sincerity of the defendantâs assurances against future
violations, the defendantâs recognition of the wrongful nature of her conduct, and the likelihood
the defendantâs occupation will present opportunities for future violations. CFT Cv. Wilshire

Inv. Mgmt. Corp., 531 F.3d 1339, 1346 (11th Cir. 2008).

 

â Kering also argues that CFTC has failed to meet its burden of demonstrating collectability of the civil
penalty. Collectability is no longer a requirement of imposing a civil penalty. See Brenner v. CFTC, 338
F.3d 713, 723 (7th Cir. 2003) (collectability no longer a consideration for conduct occurring after 1992
amendment to the Act). |

20
Case: 1:15-cv-05839 Document #: 82 Filed: 12/09/16 Page 21 of 23 PagelD #:976

A trading ban is an appropriate remedy for Liâs misconduct. As discussed above, her
violation was severe and directed at the central purpose of the Act. Her conduct was not |
isolated, but occurred on six separate occasions over two months. The clear-cut nature of her
fraud and the way in which she carried it out makes it clear that she did so with scienter. Li
contests this point, but in light of the undisputed facts it is not credible that she did not know that
her actions were wrongful. The Court also does not view Liâs assurances that she will avoid
wrongful conduct in the future as sincere. To date, she continues to provide excuses for her
misconduct and has failed to fully cooperate with the investigation. It appears that Li has failed
to fully internalize the wrongfulness of her conduct and is therefore more likely to repeat it in the
future. Finally, Liâs stated intention is to return to the United States and resume trading in
commodities following the resolution of this case. This is the exact profession where she would
likely be able to carry out future violations of the Act. The Court therefore finds that her risk of
reoffending is high.

The Court finds that a five-year trading ban and a permanent injunction against future
violations of the Act are necessary to protect the public and are reasonable in light of prior CFTC
actions. See, e.g., In the Matter of Zhang, CFTC Doc. No. 14-33, Order dated Sept. 29, 2014
(five-year trading ban for violation of Â§ 4c and no allegation of fraud); CFTC v. Singhal, No. 12-
cv-00138, Doc. 32 (N.D. Ill. Nov. 28, 2012) (five-year trading ban for violation of Â§ 4c and no
allegation of fraud and imposing a permanent injunction on future violations of the Act); Ryan v.
~ CFTC, 145 F.3d 910, 916 (7th Cir. 1998) (affirming six-year trading ban for violations of Â§Â§ 4b
and 4c); LaCrosse v. CFTC, 137 F.3d 925, 936 (7th Cir. 1998) (affirming five-year trading ban
CFTC imposed on defendant following a criminal conviction for violation of Â§-4b); Monieson v.

CFTC, 996 F.2d 852, 862 (7th Cir. 1993) (affirming a two-year trading ban where defendant was

21
Case: 1:15-cv-05839 Document #: 82 Filed: 12/09/16 Page 22 of 23 PagelD #:977

a controlling person who failed to supervise parties who violated Â§ 4b); cf CFTC v. Capitalstreet
Financial, LLC, No. 3:09-cv-387âRJCâDCK, 2012 WL 79758, at *12 (W.D.N.C. Jan. 11, |
2012) (imposing a permanent trading ban for violation of Â§ 4b where defendants operated a
âPonziâ scheme in which they misappropriated over one million dollars from customers and
concealed over $200,000 in trading losses from customers); CFTC v. Harrison, No. 8:13-âcvâ
00327-JDA, 2015 WL 1322837, at *1-2 (D.S.C. Mar. 03, 2015) (amposing permanent trading
ban in fraud case where defendant was sentenced to one year and one day in prison in related
criminal case).

4, Injunction Against Kering

CFTC also seeks a permanent injunction against future violations of the Act by Kering as
well as a permanent injunction preventing Kering from granting Li access to its futures trading
accounts and from relying on Li for trading advice or direction. An injunction against Kering is
appropriate if Kering violated the law and is likely to violate the law in the future. Hunt, 591
F.2d at 1220.

As discussed above, Kering is vicariously liable for violations of the Act Li committed in
the scope of her employment. Kering granted Li essentially unfettered access to trade on its
account and she used that access to violate the Act. Li did this using her motherâs trading
account. This arrangement made it difficult for CFTC to detect Liâs role in Keringâs trading
activity, and this difficulty supports the need to also enjoin Kering to protect the market from ~
future violations by Li. To date there is no evidence that Kering has taken any steps to limit its -
relationship with Li, including termination of her employment. Therefore the Court finds a
limited injunction against Kering is necessary to prevent future violations of the Act by Kering

and Li. The Court imposes a five-year injunction prohibiting Kering from granting Li access to

22
Case: 1:15-cv-05839 Document #: 82 Filed: 12/09/16 Page 23 of 23 PagelD #:978

its futures trading accounts and from relying on Li for trading advice or direction. The Court
also imposes a permanent injunction against future violations of the Act by Kering.
CONCLUSION

For the foregoing reasons, the Court grants CFTCâs motion for summary judgment [47].
The Court orders Defendants to disgorge $300,462.50, plus post-judgment interest, in ill-gotten
gains and return it to the Tanius Account. Additionally, the Court orders Defendants to pay a
civil penalty of $901,387.50 to CFTC. The Court enjoins Li from trading in the commodity
futures market for five years and permanently enjoins Li from violating the Act. The Court
enjoins Kering from allowing Li to trade futures on its account or consulting Li on any futures
related matters for five years. The Court also permanently enjoins Kering from future violations
of the Act. The Court grants in part and denies in part CFTCâs motion to strike [65]. The Court
strikes Liâs Amended Response to the Joint Statement of Facts and the Morgan declaration. The

Court enters judgment for CFTC. The case is terminated.
