ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTIONS 6(c) AND 6(d) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, MAKING
FINDINGS AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

I,

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ) has reason to believe that
from at least June 2010 through at least January 2014, Newedge USA, LLC, now known as SG
Americas Securities, LLC (collectively, âRespondentâ or âNewedgeâ), violated Section 4c(a) of
the Commodity Exchange Act (âActâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6c(a) (2012), and Commission Regulations
(âRegulationsâ) 1.38 and 166.3, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1.38 and 166.3 (2015). Therefore, the Commission
deems it appropriate and in the public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and
hereby are, instituted to determine whether Respondent engaged in the violations set forth herein
and to determine whether any order should be issued imposing remedial sanctions.

IL.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Respondent has
submitted an Offer of Settlement (âOfferâ), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Without admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, Respondent consents to
the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 6(c) and 6(d) of the
Commodity Exchange Act, Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (âOrderâ) and
acknowledge service of this Order.'

 

' Respondent consents to the entry of this Order and to the use of these findings in this proceeding and in any other
proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party; provided, however, that Respondent
does not consent to the use of the Offer, or the findings or conclusions in this Order consented to in the Offer, as the
sole basis for any other proceeding brought by the Commission, other than in a proceeding in bankruptcy or to
enforce the terms of this Order. Nor does Respondent consent to the use of the Offer or this Order, or the findings or
conclusions in this Order consented to in the Offer, by any other party in any other proceeding,

 
HI.
The Commission finds the following:
A, SUMMARY

Throughout the period from June 2010 through at least January 2014 (the ârelevant
periodâ), Newedge, a Futures Commission Merchant (âFCMâ) registered with the Commission,
acting through its agents, officers and employees, including certain account representatives,
executed and confirmed the execution of, and reported to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
(âCMEâ) and Chicago Board of Trade (ââCBOTâ) numerous exchange of futures for physical
transactions (âEFPsâ)â in agricultural and soft commodities for and on behalf of its clients that
are, are of the character of, or are commonly known as wash sales. These trades were for the
same contract, quantity and same or similar price with the buyer and seller for each EFP under
the same common control and ownership. Moreover, the trades were executed under
circumstances where certain Newedge account representatives either knew that clients desired to
net out futures positions across commonly owned and controlled accounts through the use of
EFPs, or else failed to inquire why clients were routinely on both sides of the EFPs.

By this conduct, Newedge executed and confirmed the execution of wash trades in
violation of Section 4c(a) of the Act. Moreover, because the EFPs were not done in accordance
with the written rules of the CME and CBOT, they were not bona fide EFPs, and, therefore,
Newedge caused prices to be reported, registered or recorded that were not true and bona fide
prices, also in violation of Section 4cÂ¢(a) of the Act. Further, by accepting and transmitting EFP
orders that were not executed openly and competitively pursuant to exchange rules, but in a
manner that avoided market risk and price competition that legitimate, competitive trading
entails, Newedge executed noncompetitive trades for customers in violation of Commission
Regulation 1.38(a).

During the relevant period, Newedge also failed to supervise diligently its employeesâ
handling of the transactions at issue and failed to have adequate policies and procedures designed
to detect and deter the execution of wash EFP trades, in violation of Regulation 166.3.

In accepting Newedgeâs Offer, the Commission recognizes Respondentâs cooperation
during this investigation and corrective action taken to address the conduct and improve its
supervisory systems and internal controls in order to detect and deter the improper use and
mishandling of wash EFPs.

 

* An EEFP is a privately negotiated transaction involving a simultaneous exchange of an exchange futures position for
a corresponding cash position at a price difference mutually agreed upon â /.e., one party buys the physical
commodity and simultaneously sells (or gives up a long) futures contract while the other party sells the physical
commodity and simultaneously buys (or receives a long) futures contract. See âReport on Exchanges of Futures for
Physicals,â Division of Trading and Markets, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, October I, 1987 at 13.

 
B. RESPONDENT

SG Americas Securities, LLC (âSGASâ) is a financial services firm based in New York
and is registered as an FCM with the Commission. Effective January 2, 2015, SGAS merged
with Newedge USA, LLC, a registered futures commission merchant, and SGAS was the
surviving entity.

C, FACTS

Throughout the relevant period, Newedge, acting through its agents, officers and
employees, including certain agricultural commodity account representatives, knowingly
accepted, executed and confirmed the execution of EFP transactions for and on behalf of its
clients that are, are of the character of, or are commonly known as wash sales. These trades were
for the same contract, quantity and same or similar price. In addition, in each instance, it was the
same beneficial owner or controller that was on both sides of the transaction. The clients entered
into the EFPs with the intent to negate market risk and price competition and the transactions
produced a financial nullity for the clients.

Newedge also reported the pricing of the futures side of those wash trades to the CME or
CBOT and âdesignated the trades as bona fide EFPs. The client who owned and controlled both
sides of the transaction selected the price at which the EFP was done. On many occasions the
futures price reported to the exchange was outside the dayâs trading range.

With respect to one client, a Newedge account representative executed, confirmed, and
reported the execution of wash EFP trades to the CBOT where the client held its long and short
futures positions in separate accounts, The client owned and controlled both accounts, The
client, in consultation with the Newedge account representative, routinely offset its short
positions by its long positions prior to each of the annual delivery periods by executing an EFP.
The Newedge account representative knew the client owned and controlled both trading accounts
and knew the terms of the EFPs âi.e., the contract, quantity and price.

In numerous other instances where other Newedge account representatives executed,
confirmed, and reported the execution of wash EFPs trades to the exchange for clients, the
Newedge account representatives either knew that the clientsâ intention was to negate market
risk and price competition or failed to inquire why the same controller or owner was on both
sides of the transactions, or to note that the EFPs were at the same contract, quantity and price
resulting in wash trades.

Prior to 2014, Newedgeâs supervisory systems and internal controls were not adequate to
detect and deter the processing and confirmation of wash sales designated as EFPs. Newedge
did not have adequate internal controls, or policies and procedures addressing EFPs and the
indicia of potential unlawful EFPs, including potential wash sales. Instead, Newedge relied upon
its account representatives to independently react to and identify any potential EFPs by Newedge
clients that might be improper or unlawful. Newedge also failed to adequately train its
employees involved in the execution, confirmation and reporting of EFPs in understanding the
requirements for executing bona fide EFPs.

 
As a result of these supervisory failures, for at least three and a half years, Newedge did
not detect the noncompetitive execution of the futures contracts and improper designation of
wash trades as EFPs. In 2014, after the CFTC Division of Enforcement began its investigation,
Newedge implemented new policies and procedures intended to detect and prevent the execution
of unlawful wash EFPs.

IV.
LEGAL DISCUSSION
A, Newedge Confirmed the Execution of Wash EFPs in Violation of Section 4c(a)

EFPs that are equal and offsetting in quantity and price, where the same entity, or
beneficial owner or controller is on both sides of the transactions, constitute âââwash salesâ within
the meaning of Section 4c(a) of the Act. In re Noble Americas Corp., CFTC Docket No. 10-12,
2010 WL 1803817 (CFTC May 3, 2010) (Consent order).

Section 4c(a) of the Act makes it âunlawful for any person to offer to enter into, enter
into, or confirm the execution of a transactionâ that âis, is of the character of, or is commonly
known to the trade as, a âwash saleâ... .â 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6c(a)(1)-(2) (2012). A wash sale is a form
of fictitious transaction. Jn re Gimbel, [1987-1990 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. rep. (CCH)
24,213 at 35,003 (CFTC Apr. 14, 1988), aff'd as to liability, 872 F.2d 196 (7th Cir. 1989); In re
Goldwurm, 7 A.D. 265, 274 (CEA 1948). Wash sales are harmful, in part, because they create
illusory price movements in the market. See Wilson v. CFTC, 322 F.3d 555, 559 (8" Cir. 2003);
Reddy y, CFTC, 191 F.3d 109, 115 (2d Cir, 1999), See also CFTC vy. Savage, 611 F.2d 270, 284
(9th Cir. 1980) (wash sales may mislead market participants because they do not reflect the
forces of supply and demand); Jn re Piasio, [1999-2000 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep.
(CCH) 28,276 at 50,691 (CFTC Sep. 29, 2000) (wash sales are âgraveâ violations, even in the
absence of customer harm or appreciable market effect, because âthey undermine confidence in
the market mechanism that underlies price discovery.â)

The liability of the customer initiating the wash sale depends upon evidence
demonstrating that the customer intended to negate market risk or price competition. ed. at
{ 50,685. Similarly, the liability of a participant in the wash sale requires a showing that the
participant knew, at the time he chose to participate in the transaction, that the transaction was
designed to achieve a wash result in a manner that negated risk. Jn re Bear Sterns & Co., [1990-
1992 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) J 24,994 at 37,665 (CFTC Jan. 25, 1991). An
account representativeâs intent to knowingly participate in a wash sale may be inferred from his
failure to undertake a reasonable inquiry in the face of facts suggesting his customer intended to
avoid a bona fide market position. Jn re Three Eight Corporation, [1992-1994 Transfer Binder]
Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) 25,749 at 40,445 (CFTC June 16, 1993). The fact that the same
entity, or beneficial owner or controller, was on both sides of an EFP, standing alone, suggests an
intent to avoid a price competition and market risk, Likewise, the fact that the EFP is for the
same contract, quantity and same or similar price â i.e., a wash result â reflects an intent to avoid
market risk and price competition, An account representativeâs failure to undertake an inquiry
into the legitimacy of the EFP in the face of such facts can support an inference of knowing
participation in wash sales. Jd.

 
âJust as a customer has a duty not to initiate transactions with an intent to avoid a bona
fide market position, .. . an FCM has a duty not to accept such orders and transmit them to the
trading floor.â /d., | 25,749 at 40,445, Therefore, â[a] broker is responsible for evaluating the
orders he receives for indications that his participation in the transaction is legally prohibited.â
Id.; see also Piasio, { 28,276 at 50,689 (an account executive has a duty to inquire about a
customerâs intent when he receives simultaneous orders to buy and sell the same spread).

Here, Newedge, through the acts of account representatives and others, knowingly
executed and confirmed the execution of wash EFP transactions for clients in agricultural and
soft commodities where the buyer and seller for each EFP was under the same common control
and/or ownership.â By engaging in these wash EFPs, Newedge clients were able to avoid price
competition and market risk. Accordingly, Newedge violated Section 4c(a) of the Act.

B. Newedge Caused Prices to be Reported, Registered, or Recorded at Non-Bona Fide
Prices in Violation of Section 4Â¢(a)

Section 4c(a) of the Act also makes it unlawful to offer to enter into, enter into, or
confirm the execution of a commodity futures transaction that ââis used to cause any price to be
reported, registered, or recorded that is not a true and bona fide price.â 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6c(a) (2012).

Congressâ intent in enacting Section 4c(a) was to âensure that all trades are focused in the
centralized marketplace to participate in the competitive determination of the price of futures
contracts.ââ Za re Collins, [1996-1998 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) 4 27,194 at
45,742 (CFTC Dec. 10, 1997) (quoting S. Rep. No. 93-1131, at 16-17 (1974)). In other words,
Section 4c(a) was meant to âprevent collusive trades conducted away from the trading pits,â
Merrill Lynch Futures, Inc. vy. Kelly, 585 F. Supp. 1245, 1251 n.3 (S.D.N.Y. 1984), and âto
outlaw insofar as possible all schemes of trading that are artificial and not the result of arms-
length trading on the basis of supply and demand factors,â [nm re Goldwurm, 7 Agric, Dec. 265,
276 (1948). Here, Newedge reported prices to the exchanges that were determined off-exchange
by a single person or entity that controlled both sides of the wash EFP transactions.

Even though an individual EFP, when executed between independent parties, results in
the actual transfer of the cash commodity, and is supported by proper documentation, may be
privately negotiated âex pitâ at any commercially reasonable price agreeable to the
counterparties, a wash EFP is a non-bona fide transaction in violation of Regulation 1.38(a),

 

* EFPs are a subset of transactions known as Exchange for Related Positions (âEFRPsâ). CME and CBOT exchange
rules set out the requirements for bona-fide EFRPs. With respect to who may be parties to a EFRP, the exchange
require that the opposing accounts to an EFRP transaction must be (a) independently controlled accounts with
different beneficial ownership; or (b) independently controlled accounts of separate legal entities with common
beneficial ownership; or (c) independently controlled accounts of the same legal entity, provided that the account
controllers operate in separate business units; or (d) commonly controlled accounts of separate legal entities
provided that the separate legal entities have different beneficial ownership. For EFRP transactions between
accounts with common beneficial ownership, the parties to the trade must be able to demonstrate the independent
control of the accounts and that the transaction had economic substance for each party to the trade. See CME,
CBOT, NYMEX & COMEX Market Regulatory Advisory Notice, (Rule 538) CME Group RA1006-5 (June 11,
2010).

 
thereby making the prices reported for such transactions also non-bona fide. See Jn re Gilchrist,
[1990-1992 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) 4 24,993, at 37,653 (CFTC Jan. 25,
1991) (finding non-bona fide price in violation of Section 4c(a) of the Act where trades were
non-bona fide in violation of Regulation 1.38). In fact, the prices reported on unlawfully
executed noncompetitive trades are non-bona fide even if they accurately reflect the prices
agreed upon by the parties and the current price for similar contracts traded on exchange. Jd. In
this case, because the EFPs were non bona fide, Newedge violated Section 4c(a) when it reported
non-bona fide prices for the futures side of the wash EFPs to the CME and CBOT,

Cc, Newedge Violated Regulation 1.38(a)

Generally, Commission Regulation 1.38(a) requires that all purchases and sales of
commodity futures be executed âopenly and competitively.â This general requirement, however,
âshall not apply to transactions which are executed noncompetitively in accordance with written
rules of the contract market ... specifically providing for the noncompetitive execution of such
transactions.â EFPs are non-competitive off-exchange transactions. CME and CBOT Rule 538
only permits âExchanges for Related Positionsâ â of which EFPs are a sub-set â under certain
conditions, EFPs are permissible only if they are between two independent parties and involve
privately negotiated and simultaneous exchange of a futures position for a corresponding and
offsetting cash physical position. If a noncompetitive trade does not qualify for an exception to
this exchange rule, it violates Regulation 1.38(a). Williams y. Lind-Waldock & Co., [1996-1998
Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) 4 27,111 at 45,237, 1997 WL 381248 (CFTC
July 10, 1997); In re GNP Commodities, Inc., [1990-1992 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep.
(CCH) Â§ 25,360, at 39,217 (CFTC Aug. 11, 1992), aff'd sub nom. Monieson v. CFTC, 996 F.2d
852 (7"" Cir. 1993).

As explained, supra, Newedge, through its account representatives and others, processed
and confirmed the execution of wash EF Ps that did not meet the exchange requirements for
noncompetitive trades. Therefore, Newedge violated Regulation 1.38(a).

D. Newedge Is Liable for Its Employeesâ Acts and Omissions

The foregoing acts, omissions, and failures of Newedgeâs account representatives and other
employees occurred within the scope of their employment, office, or agency with Newedge; therefore,
pursuant to Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, as amended, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(a)(1)(B), and Regulation 1.2,

17 C.ELR. Â§ 1.2 (2015), Newedge is liable for those acts, omissions, and failures in violation of Section
4c(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6c(a) (2006), and Commission Regulation 1,38, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.38 (2015),

E. Newedge Lacked an Adequate Supervisory System and Compliance Programs to
Detect and Deter Wash EFPs in Violation of Regulation 166.3

Commission Regulation 166.3 imposes on registrants an affirmative duty to supervise
their partners, employees and agents diligently by establishing, implementing and executing
adequate supervisory structures and compliance programs. âThe duty to supervise... include[s]
the broader goals of detection and deterrence of possible wrongdoing by [a registrantâs] agents.â
Lobb vy. LT. McKerr & Co., [1987-1990 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) { 24,568,
at 33,444 (CFTC Dec. 14, 1989). âIn appropriate circumstances, a showing that the registrant

 
lacks an adequate supervisory system can be sufficient to establish a breach of duty under Rule
166.3.â See In re Thomas Collins, [1996-1998 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH)
27,194 at 45,744 (CFTC Dec. 10, 1997). A violation under Commission Regulation 166.3 is an
independent violation for which no underlying violation is necessary. /d.; see also Inre Paragon
Futures Association, [1990-1992 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) { 26,266 at
38,850 (CFTC Apr. 1, 1992). There is no requirement to charge an underlying violation of the
Act. Inre First National Trading Corporation, [1992-1994 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L.
Rep. (CCH) { 26,142 at 41,786 (CFTC July 20, 1994) (âIn appropriate circumstances, proof of
an independent substantive violation is not a necessary element to establish a breach of the duty
imposed by Rule 166.3.â), aff'd without op., Pick v. CFTC, No. 95-3761, 99 F.3d 1139 (6" Cir.
Oct. 26, 1996).

A violation of Regulation 166.3 is demonstrated by showing either that: (1) the
registrantâs supervisory system was generally inadequate; or (2) the registrant failed to perform
its supervisory duties diligently. In re Murlas Commodities, [1994-1996 Transfer Binder]
Comm. Fut. L Rep. (CCH) Â§ 26,485, at 43,161 (CFTC Sept. 1, 1995); In re GNP Commodities,
Ine., | 25,360, at 39,219 (providing that, even if an adequate supervisory system is in place,
Regulation 166.3 can still be violated if the supervisory system is not diligently administered);
Samson Refining Co. v. Drexel Burnham Lambert, Inc., [1987-1990 Transfer Binder] Comm.
Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) 7 24,596, at 36,566 (CFTC Feb. 16, 1990) (noting that, under Regulation
166.3, an FCM has a âduty to develop procedures for the detection and deterrence of possible
wrongdoing by its agentsâ) (internal quotation omitted), Evidence of violations that âshould be
detected by a diligent system of supervision, either because of the nature of the violations or
because the violations have occurred repeatedly,â is probative of a failure to supervise. /n re
Paragon Futures Assoc., | 25,266 at 38,850.

During the relevant period, Newedge lacked adequate internal controls and procedures to
verify the validity of EFPs before they were cleared and reported to the CME and CBOT.
Newedge also lacked adequate procedures and surveillance systems to identify trades incorrectly
or improperly designated as EFPs. Finally, Newedge failed to provide adequate training to its
employees who participated in the execution or processing of EFPs regarding the requirements
for bona fide EFPs. As a result, Newedge failed to detect numerous wash EFPs between
commonly owned and controlled client accounts.

Accordingly, Newedge failed to supervise its employees diligently, in violation of
Commission Regulation 166.3.

V.
