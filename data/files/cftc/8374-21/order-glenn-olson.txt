ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTION 6(c) AND (d) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, MAKING
FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

I. INTRODUCTION

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ) has reason to believe that
from in or about April 2014 through March 2018 (âRelevant Periodâ), Respondent Glenn Olson
(âRespondentâ) violated Sections 2(e), 4c(b), 4d(a)(1) and 6(c)(1) of the Commodity Exchange
Act (âActâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 2(e), 6c(b), 6d(a)(1), 9(1) (2018), and Regulations 32.2, 32.4 and
180.1(a) of the Commission Regulations (âRegulationsâ) promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R.

Â§Â§ 32.2, 32.4, 180.1(a) (2020). Therefore, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the
public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted to determine
whether Respondent engaged in the violations set forth herein and to determine whether any
order should be issued imposing remedial sanctions.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Respondent has
submitted an Offer of Settlement (âOfferâ), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Respondent consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Section 6(c)
and (d) of the Commodity Exchange Act, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions
(âOrderââ), and acknowledges service of this Order. !

 

' Respondent agrees that the findings of fact and conclusions of law in this Order shall be taken as true and correct
and be given preclusive effect without further proof in this proceeding and any other proceeding brought by the
Commission or to which the Commission is a party or claimant, including but not limited to, a proceeding in
bankruptcy or receivership.
II. FINDINGS
Respondent admits, and the Commission finds, the following:
A. SUMMARY

On October 23, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York found
that during the Relevant Period several related persons and entities operating as a common
enterprise (âBlue Bit Enterpriseâ) engaged in a fraudulent scheme involving binary options
trading and a succeeding virtual currency scam that resulted in U.S. customers losing the
ageregate sum of $846,405.58. CFTC v. Kantor, No. 18-cv-2247-SJF-ARL, 2019 WL 6796680
(E.D.N.Y. Oct. 23, 2019), ECF No. 49 (default order). The court found that the Blue Bit
Enterprise had fraudulently solicited their customers to open and trade binary options accounts
on an illegal off-exchange binary options trading platform at www.bluebitbanc.com. As part of
the scheme, the Blue Bit Enterprise misrepresented the profitability of trading through Blue Bit,
manipulated or fabricated purported trades in their customersâ accounts to the customersâ
disadvantage, prevented customers from withdrawing funds, and misappropriated customer
funds. Olson acted as part of the Blue Bit Enterprise and knowingly made false statements,
omitted statements of material fact, and took other actions to defraud customers, while receiving
disbursements from the Blue Bit Enterprise totaling $241,070.30.

B. RESPONDENT

Glenn Olson is a natural person residing in Brooklyn, New York. During the Relevant
Period, Olson was employed by Blue Bit Banc, and functioned as part of the Blue Bit Enterprise.
In addition, Olson was president and legal agent of G. Thomas Client Services Ltd., a New York
corporation incorporated on July 28, 2015, which also was part of the Blue Bit Enterprise.
Neither Olson, G. Thomas, nor any other member of the Blue Bit Enterprise has ever been
registered with the Commission in any capacity.

C. FACTS

In 2014, Olson affiliated with a United Kingdom company called Blue Bit Banc (âBlue
Bitâ) that had launched a website at www.bluebitbanc.com to introduce U.S. retail customers to
the Blue Bit binary options trading platform. In connection with his work at Blue Bit Banc,
Olson sold binary options to customers, processed credit card transactions and supervised
employees. Olson used the aliases âGreg Tolanâ or âG. Thomasâ to conduct Blue Bit Enterprise
business.

A binary option is a type of options contract in which the payout depends entirely on the
outcome of a yes/no proposition based upon particular outcomes in the markets for securities,

 

* The Blue Bit Enterprise included two individuals, Blake Harrison Kantor and Nathan Mullins, and four entities,
Blue Bit Banc, Blue Bit Analytics, Ltd., G. Thomas Client Services Ltd. (âG. Thomasâ), and Mercury Cove, Inc. In
a related criminal case in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, Kantor pleaded guilty to
conspiracy to commit wire fraud and admitted to obstructing an investigation into his fraudulent scheme. Kantor
was sentenced to 86 months of incarceration. See Judgment in a Criminal Case, United States v. Kantor, No. 18 CR
177 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 1, 2019), ECF No. 58.
currencies or other assets or propositions. Binary options are different than ordinary options in
that they are cash-settled, thereby giving the options holder a pre-determined amount of money if
the customer has made a correct prediction or the customer loses the premium if he or she has
made an incorrect prediction. Binary options are required to be traded on a registered board of
trade. During the Relevant Period, and currently, only three designated contract markets were
and are authorized to offer binary options that are commodity options to retail customers in the
U.S.: Cantor Exchange LP, Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Inc. and the North American
Derivatives Exchange, Inc. All other entities offering binary options in the U.S. or to U.S.
customers, such as the Blue Bit Enterprise, are doing so illegally.

Olson, the Blue Bit Enterprise, and Blue Bit retail customers were not eligible contract
participants (âECPsâ) as defined in Section 1a(18)(A)(x1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1a(18)(A)(x1)
(2018). Nonetheless, Olson and others in the Blue Bit Enterprise solicited customers in and
outside of New York, through phone calls and emails and through the bluebitbanc.com website,
to open self-traded and managed binary options accounts with Blue Bit. He and others in the
Blue Bit Enterprise falsely claimed that the binary options transactions on the Blue Bit platform
would be based upon the actual prices of securities, currencies, and other assets at particular
points in time, and would generate predetermined profits. Olson intentionally made these
misrepresentations and took other actions to defraud customers during the course of his
involvement with the Blue Bit Enterprise.

After convincing prospective customers to open Blue Bit trading accounts, Olson and
others acting on behalf of the Blue Bit Enterprise would instruct them how to fund their new
accounts, typically advising customers to send their funds by wire or credit card to a specified
overseas bank account. In turn, a portion of those funds were funneled into a bank account
opened in the name of G. Thomas, a U.S. company incorporated by Olson, and used to pay Blue
Bit Enterprise business expenses, including salaries and commissions to Blue Bit sales staff, and
personal expenses of Olson and others.

Once customers opened Blue Bit accounts, Olson and other individuals acting on behalf
of the Blue Bit Enterprise either made purported binary options trades for the customers on a
discretionary basis or else instructed the customers on how to enter orders through the Blue Bit
online order-entry platform on the Blue Bit website. Olson knew, but did not disclose, that the
Blue Bit Enterprise then manipulated data associated with customer trades to the customersâ
disadvantage, creating trading losses for the customers.

The Blue Bit Enterprise and Olson, who were not ECPs, entered off-exchange swaps
transactions with retail customers.

The Blue Bit Enterprise also misrepresented to customers that they could withdraw their
fund balances at any time after their Blue Bit trading accounts had reached a specified volume of
activity. In fact, the Blue Bit Enterprise frequently imposed undisclosed requirements to prevent
or discourage customers from withdrawing their funds.

In or around October 2017, the Blue Bit Enterprise began encouraging customers to
transfer their Blue Bit account balances to new company called Bitsblockchain, which purported
to offer customers the opportunity to purchase its new virtual currency called âATMC,â or
âATM Coinâ or âAsset Trading Market Coin.â ATMC purported to be a cryptocurrency
utilizing open-source blockchain technology with no government authority controlling it.
Bitsblockchain offered ATMC for sale to retail customers via its website, which was linked to
the Blue Bit website. However, as with their former binary options balances, Blue Bit customers
were unable to withdraw account balances that purportedly had been transferred into ATMC
accounts at Bitsblockchain.

At least twenty-seven U.S. customers of the Blue Bit Enterprise who deposited funds to
trade binary options with Blue Bit lost the aggregate sum of $846,405.58. Olson received
disbursements from the Blue Bit Enterprise totaling $241,070.30 in the form of checks or
transfers to his personal bank account during the Relevant Period.

HI. LEGAL DISCUSSION
A. Illegal Off-Exchange Retail Swaps in Violation of Section 2(e) of the Act

An ECP is defined in Section 11a(18)(A)(x1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1a(18)(A0(x1) (2018),
in relevant part, as an individual who has amounts invested on a discretionary basis, the
ageregate of which exceeds $10 million, or $5 million if the individual enters into the transaction
to manage the risk associated with an asset or liability incurred, or reasonably likely to be owned
or incurred, by the individual.

Section 1a(47)(A) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1a(47)(A) (2018), defines âswapâ to include,
among other things, any agreement, contract, or transaction that: (a) is an option of any kind;
(b) provides for payment dependent on the occurrence, nonoccurrence, or the extent of the
occurrence of an event or contingency; or (c) provides on an executory basis for payments based
on the value or level of one or more interest or other rates, currencies, commodities, securities,
instruments of indebtedness, indices, quantitative measures, or other financial or economic
interests or property of any kind, without also conveying an ownership interest in any asset or
liability.

Section 2(e) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(e) (2018), makes it unlawful for any person who is
not an ECP-1.Â¢., any person who is a retail customerâto enter into a swap unless the swap is
entered into on or subject to the rules of, a board of trade designated as a contract market under
section 5 (hereafter referred to as âregistered exchangeâ).

The binary options offered by the Blue Bit Enterprise constituted swaps transactions.
During the Relevant Period, Olson on behalf of the Blue Bit Enterprise, which was a non-ECP,
entered into swaps transactions, and the swaps transactions entered into were not executed on
any registered exchange or exempt foreign exchange.

By entering into off-exchange swaps transactions as a non-ECP, the Blue Bit Enterprise
violated Section 2(e) of the Act. Olson had knowledge of the wrongdoing underlying the
violation and intentionally assisted the Blue Bit Enterprise in entering illegal swaps; thus, Olson
aided and abetted the violation of Section 2(e) of the Act, and is liable for the violation pursuant
to Section 13(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13c(a) (2018), which provides, in relevant part, that

4
â[a|ny person who commits, or who willfully aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces, or
procures the commission of, a violation of [the Act or Regulations], or who acts in combination
or concert with any other person in any such violation . .. may be held responsible for such
violation as a principal.â

B. Illegal Off-Exchange Commodity Options in Violation of Section 4c(b) of the Act
and Regulation 32.2

Congress gave the Commission jurisdiction and plenary rulemaking authority over all
commodity option transactions through Section 4c(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6c(b) (2018).
Section 4c(b) of the Act and Commission Regulation 32.2, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 32.2 (2020), ban off-
exchange trading of commodity option contracts and, specifically, makes it unlawful for any
person to offer to enter into, enter into, or confirm the execution of, any transaction involving
any commodity regulated under the Act which is of the character of, or is commonly known as,
inter alia, an âoption,â âbid,â âoffer,â âput,â or âcall,â contrary to any rule, regulation, or order of
the Commission prohibiting any such transaction or allowing any such transaction under such
terms and conditions as the Commission shall prescribe.

Regulation 32.2 makes it unlawful for any person to offer to enter into, enter into,
confirm the execution of, maintain a position in, or otherwise conduct activity related to any
transaction in interstate commerce that is a commodity option transaction, unless: (a) such
transaction is conducted in compliance with and subject to the provisions of the Act, including
any Commission rule, regulation, or order thereunder, otherwise applicable to any other swap, or
(b) is a trade option conducted pursuant to Regulation 32.3, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 32.3 (2020)âwhich
these were not.

The binary options transactions offered by the Blue Bit Enterprise also constituted
commodity options transactions. Olson and the Blue Bit Enterprise offered to enter into, entered
into, confirmed the execution of, maintained a position in, or otherwise conducted activity
related to commodity options, other than on a registered exchange and without seeking
registration as an exempt foreign exchange, and thereby violated Section 4c(b) of the Act and
Regulation 32.2.

OF Unregistered FCM Activities in Violation of Section 4d(a)(1) of the Act

Section 1a(28) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1la(28) (2018), defines, in part, a futures
commission merchant (âFCMâ) as an individual, association, partnership, corporation, or trust
that is engaged in soliciting and accepting orders for commodity options or swaps. Section
4d(a)(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6d(a)(1) (2018), makes it unlawful for any person to act as an
FCM unless such person is registered with the Commission.

Olson and other members of the Blue Bit Enterprise, including G. Thomas, who have
never been registered in any capacity with the Commission, solicited or accepted orders for
commodity options or swaps, and accepted money to margin, guarantee, or secure trades or
contracts resulting from those commodity options or swaps without registration as an FCM. The
Blue Bit Enterprise thereby violated Section 4d(a)(1) of the Act. Olson had knowledge of the
wrongdoing underlying the violation and intentionally assisted the Blue Bit Enterprise in acting

5
as an FCM; thus, Olson aided and abetted the violations by Blue Bit Enterprise, and is liable for
the violations pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Act.

D. Commodity Options Fraud in Violation of Section 4c(b) of the Act and Regulation
32.4

Regulation 32.4, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 32.4 (2020), promulgated under Section 4c(b) of the Act,
provides that:

In or in connection with an offer to enter into, the entry into, or the confirmation
of the execution of, any commodity option transaction, it shall be unlawful for
any person, directly or indirectly:

(a) To cheat or defraud or attempt to cheat or defraud any other person;

(b) To make or cause to be made to any other person any false report or
statement thereof or cause to be entered for any person any false record
thereof; or

(c) To deceive or attempt to deceive any other person by any means
whatsoever.

Olson and the Blue Bit Enterprise, in or in connection with an offer to enter into, the
entry into, or the confirmation of the execution of, any commodity option transaction, directly
and indirectly: (a) cheated or defrauded, and attempted to cheat and defraud, customers and
prospective customers; (b) made or caused to be made to customers and prospective customers
false reports or statements; and (c) deceived or attempted to deceive customers and prospective
customers, in violation of Section 4c(b) of the Act and Regulation 32.4.

E. Manipulative & Deceptive Devices in Connection with Swaps in Violation of
Section 6(c)(1) of the Act and Regulation 180.1(a)

Section 6(c)(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 9(1) (2018), makes it âunlawful for any person,
directly or indirectly, to use or employ, or attempt to use or employ, in connection with any
swap, ... any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance, in contravention of such rules
and regulations as the Commission shall promulgate. . .â

Regulation 180.1(a), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 180.1(a) (2020), in turn, specifically provides that âit
shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, in connection with any swap, .. . on or
subject to the rules of any registered entity, to intentionally or recklessly: (1) Use or employ, or
attempt to use or employ, any manipulative device, scheme, or artifice to defraud; (2) Make, or
attempt to make, any untrue or misleading statement of a material fact or to omit to state a
material fact necessary in order to make the statements made not untrue or misleading; or
(3) Engage, or attempt to engage, in any act, practice, or course of business, which operates or
would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person...â
Olson, intentionally or recklessly, directly and indirectly, in connection with swaps:
(a) used or employed, or attempted to use or employ, manipulative devices, schemes, and
artifices to defraud; (b) made, or attempted to make, untrue or misleading statements of material
facts; (c) omitted to state material facts necessary in order to make statements made not untrue or
misleading; and (d) engaged, or attempted to engage, in acts, practices, and courses of business,
which operated or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon customers or prospective customers,
in violation of Section 6(c)(1) of the Act, and Regulation 180.1(a).

F. Olson is Liable as a Control Person for the Violations of G. Thomas and the Blue Bit
Enterprise

Olson controlled G. Thomas and the Blue Bit Enterprise, and had actual knowledge of the
underlying violations of G. Thomas and the Blue Bit Enterprise by virtue of his direct
participation in the underlying acts. In addition, while acting as a controlling person of G.
Thomas and the Blue Bit Enterprise, Olson did not act in good faith or knowingly induced,
directly or indirectly, G. Thomasâs and the Blue Bit Enterpriseâs acts constituting the violations
of the Act and Regulations. Therefore, pursuant to Section 13(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13c(b)
(2018), Olson is liable for G. Thomasâs and Blue Bitâs violations of Sections 2(e), 4c(b), 4d(a)(1)
and 6(c)(1) of the Act, and Regulations 32.2, 32.4 and 180.1(a).

IV. FINDINGS OF VIOLATIONS

Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that, during the Relevant Period,
Respondent violated Sections 2(e), 4c(b), 4d(a)(1) and 6(c)(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 2(e), 6c(b),
6d(a)(1), 9(1) (2018), and Regulations 32.2, 32.4 and 180.1(a), 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 32.2, 32.4, 180.1(a)
(2020).
