ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTION 6(c) AND 6(d) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT,
MAKING FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

I.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ or âCFTCâ) has reason to
believe that The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. (ââBTMUâ or âRespondentâ) has violated
Section 4c(a)(5)(C) of the Commodity Exchange Act (the âActâ or the âCEAâ), 7 U.S.C.

Â§ 6c(a)(5)(C) (2012). Therefore, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest
that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted to determine whether the
Respondent engaged in the violations set forth herein, and to determine whether any order shall
be issued imposing remedial sanctions. |

IL.

In anticipation of the institution of administrative proceedings, the Respondent has
submitted an Offer of Settlement (âOfferâ), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Without admitting or denying the findings or conclusions herein, the Respondent herein consents
to the entry and acknowledges service of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Sections
6(c) and 6(d) of the Commodity Exchange Act, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial
Sanctions (âOrderâ)!

 

' The Respondent consents to the entry of this Order and to the use of these findings and conclusions in

this proceeding and in any other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a
party; provided, however, that the Respondent does not consent to the use of the Offer, or the findings or
conclusions in this Order, as the sole basis for any other proceeding brought by the Commission, other
than in a proceeding in bankruptcy or to enforce the terms of this Order. Nor does the Respondent
consent to the use of the Offer or this Order, or the findings and conclusions in this Order consented to in
the Offer, by any other party in any other proceeding. )
Ill.

The Commission finds the following:

A. Summary

From at least July 2009 through December 2014 (the âRelevant Periodâ), BTMU â by
and through one of its traders (âTrader Aâ) â engaged in the disruptive trading practice of
âspoofingâ in markets for a variety of futures products traded on designated contract markets in
the United States. These products included futures contracts based on United States treasury
notes, and Eurodollars. BTMUâs disruptive trading violated Section 4c(a)(5)(C) of the Act.

In accepting the Respondentâs Offer, the Commission recognizes the Respondentâs
cooperation with the Division of Enforcementâs (âDivisionâ) investigation of this matter. The
Commission notes that the Respondent promptly self-reported the misconduct and proactively
implemented large-scale remedial measures and process improvements to deter and detect
similar misconduct.

B. Respondent

The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, UFJ Ltd. âBTMUâ) is a Japanese banking
corporation headquartered in Tokyo, Japan. As part of its business activities, BTMU engaged
during the Relevant Period in proprietary trading of futures contracts in the United States.
BTMU employed Trader A in one of its Tokyo offices. BTMU has been provisionally
registered with the Commission as a swap dealer since December 31, 2012.

C. Facts

 

1. BIMUâs Disruptive Trading

During the Relevant Period, BTMU employed a number of traders, including Trader A,
in its Tokyo offices. As part of his duties, Trader A traded a variety of futures contracts on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange (âCMEâ) and the Chicago Board of Trade (âCBOTâ), including
futures contracts based on United States treasury notes (âTreasuriesâ) and Eurodollars
(âEurodollarsâ). Trader A accessed these markets through a trading platform from one of
BTMDUâs Tokyo offices.

During the Relevant Period, although largely in 2010 and 2011, Trader A placed multiple
orders for futures contracts with an intent to cancel the orders before their execution
(âspoofingâ). Trader A spoofed a variety of futures contracts traded on the CME and CBOT,
including Treasuries and Eurodollars. Trader Aâs spoofing strategies included submitting orders
on opposite sides of the same market at nearly the same time. In this pattern, Trader A first
placed one or more relatively small bids or offers (âOrder 1â). Soon thereafter, in the same
market, Trader A entered one or more larger bids or offers (âOrder 2â) while Order 1 rested live
in the market. Order 2 was placed on the opposite side of the market from Order 1. Hence, if
Order 1 was a bid, Order 2 was an offer, and vice versa. In many instances, Trader A then
received a partial or complete fill on Order 1, and then cancelled Order 2 before it was filled.

2
Trader A engaged in this spoofing activity in order to move the market in a direction favorable to
Order 1.

2. BIMU?âs Self-Reporting, Cooperation, and Remediation

Once aware of Trader Aâs misconduct, BTMU promptly suspended Trader A and
reported the conduct to the Division. BTMU commenced an expansive internal review and
assisted the Divisionâs investigation of the conduct. BTMUâs assistance expedited the
Divisionâs investigation. At the same time, BTMU launched an overhaul of its systems and
controls and implemented a variety of enhancements to detect and prevent similar misconduct.
As part of this process, BTMU revised its policies, updated its training, and implemented
electronic systems to identify spoofing. BTMUâs automated anti-spoofing measures include
reviewing trading data and communications for suspicious activity.

IV.
LEGAL DISCUSSION
A, Section 4c(a)(5)(C) of the Act â Spoofing Violations

Section 4c(a)(5)(C) of the Act makes it unlawful for â[a]ny person to engage in any
trading, practice, or conduct on or subject to the rules of a registered entity that . . . is, is of the
character of, or is commonly known to the trade as, âspoofingâ (bidding or offering with the
intent to cancel the bid or offer before execution).â As described above, Trader A entered into
multiple bids or offers on a registered entity with the intent to cancel the bids or offers before
execution in violation of Section 4c(a)(5)(C) of the Act. See, e.g., CFTC v. Oystacher, No. 15-
CV-09196 (N.D. Ill. Dec. 20, 2016); CFTC v. Nav Sarao Futures Ltd., 15-CV-3398 (N.D. Ill.
Nov. 14, 2016); CFTC v. Khara, No. 15 cv 03497 (S.D.N.Y. Mar 31, 2016).

B. Respondent B U_Is Liable for the Acts of Its Agents

Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(a)(1)(B) (2012), and Commission Regulation
1.2,17C.F.R. Â§ 1.2 (2016), provide that the act, omission or failure of any official, agent or
other person acting for any individual, association, partnership, corporation or trust within the
scope of his employment or office shall be deemed the act, omission or failure of such
individual, association, partnership, corporation or trust. Under Section 2(a)(1)(B) and
Commission Regulation 1.2, principals are strictly liable for the actions of their agents. See, e.g.,
Rosenthal & Co. v. CFTC, 802 F.2d 963, 966 (7th Cir. 1986); Dohmen-Ramirez & Wellington
Advisory, Inc. vy. CFTC, 837 F.2d 847, 857-58 (9th Cir. 1988).

Trader A engaged in the conduct described herein within the course and scope of his
employment at BTMU. Therefore, BTMU is liable for the acts, omissions and failures of Trader
A, as described above, that constituted violations of Section 4c(a)(5)(C) of the Act.
