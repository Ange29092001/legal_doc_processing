I, SUMMARY
1. Defendant Laino Group Limited d/b/a PaxForex (ââPaxForexââ) operates a website

and trading platform, www.paxforex.com, which allows customers to trade commodities ranging
from foreign currencies and precious metals to certain digital assets including ether, litecoin, and
bitcoin. The problem with Defendantâs business is that it is illegally soliciting or accepting
orders for leveraged, margined or financed retail off-exchange foreign currency (âforexâ),
precious metals, and digital asset transactions from U.S. customers without being registered with
Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionââ), as required.

2. From at least March 2018 through the present (the âRelevant Periodâ), Defendant,
through the actions of its officers, employees, and/or agents, has conducted a business in the
United States in a manner that violates Section 4(a) of the Commodity Exchange Act (âActâ),

7 U.S.C. Â§ 6(a) (2018): by soliciting or accepting orders from non-eligible contract participants
(ânon-ECPsââ), not conducted on or subject to the rules of any Commission-regulated exchange,

for the purchase or sale of gold, silver (together, âprecious metalsââ), ether, litecoin, and bitcoin
 

(collectively, âdigital assetsâ) on a leveraged, margined or financed basis that does not result in
actual delivery of the commodities to the customer (retail commodity transactionsâ).

3. Further, without registering with the Commission as a futures commission
merchant (RCMâ), Defendant, in or in connection with forex and retail commodity transactions,
accepis money, securities, or property (or extends credit in leu thereof) in the form of bitcom or
other assets, to margin, guarantee, or secure trades or contracts that result or may result
therefrom, in violation of Section 4d(a)(1) of the Act, 7 LLS.C. 8 6d(ajcd) (2018).

4. Pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. $ 13a-L 018), the Commission
brings this action to enjoin Defendantâs unlawful acts and practices, to compel comphance with
the Act, and to further enjorn Defendant from engaging in any commodity-related activity.

5. In addition, the Commission seeks civil monetary penalties and remedial ancillary
relief, including but not limited to, trading and registration bans, disgorgement, restitution,
rescission, pre-judgment and post-judgment mierest, and such other relief as the Court may deem
necessary and appropriate.

6. Uniess restrained and enjoined by this Court, Defendant is likely to continue to
engage in the acts and practices alleged m this Complaint, or similar acts and practices, as more
fully described below.

Â¥v. FACTS

20. During the Relevant Period, Detendant operated an online trading platform
(âplatformâ) accessed through its website, www.paxforex.com (website). Through its platform
and website Defendant solicits or accepts orders from customers, mcluding those im the United
States, for transactions in âContracts for Differenceâ (âCFDsââ) referenced to the prices of
commodities mchiding certain foreign currencies, precious metals, and digital assets. Defendant
aiso solicits customers through its PaxPorex YouTube channel at www.youtube.com.

21. A CED is generally an agreement to exchange the difference m value of an
underlying asset, such as a commodity, between the time at which the CFD trading position
(âpositionâ) is established and the time at which it is terminated.

22. Foreign currencies, gold, silver, ether, htecoin, and bitcoin are âcommoditiesâ
under Section La(Q) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ ta(9) (2018).

23. CFD trading on the platform is settled in U.S. Dollars (USD) and bitcoim,
among other assets.

24, Bitcoin, ether, and htecoim are digital representations of value that function as
mediums of exchange, units of account, and/or stores of value, but that do not have legal tender
status in any jurisdiction. Bitcoin and other virtual currencies are distinct from ârealâ currencies,
which are the coin and paper money of the United States or another country that are designated
as tegal tender, circulate, and are customarily used and accepted as a medium of exchange in the

couniry of issuance.

6
 

25. To begin trading or open a position on Defendantâs platform, customers complete

a brief registration process through www.paxforex.com. During the registration process,
customers provide, among other information, their country, a physical address, email address,
and phone number to which PaxForex sends email and text messages, respectively, for
verification.

26. For entering personal information, Defendant provides customers with a drop
down menu with an option of selecting the United States as the customer's country of residence
as weil as an American flag symbol that corresponds to the customerâs area code and phone
number.

27. After completing the registration process, U.S. custorners deposit assets such as
USD and bitcoin into an account or wallet controlled by PaxForex as margin or collateral for the
customers trades.

28. When a customer deposits bitcoin as collateral, Defendant credits the customer's
trading account in USD in an amount that is purportedly equivalent to the market value of the
bitcotn.

29. Trades on Defendantâs platform are made using MetaTrader (*MTââ) trading
platform software, which U.S. customers can download from Defendant's website onto their
desktop or mobile devices. For trading foreign currencies, MT presents customers with currency
pairs such as the Euro/USD (EUR/USD) and Australian Dollar/USD (AUD/USD) im which the
first currency is the currency being âboughtâ or âsold,â and the second currency ts the currency
in which the buy or sell price is quoted.

30. Similarly, for trading digital assets, the platformâs MT presents customers with

pairs unchuding ether/USD CETH/USD), litecoin/USD (LTC/USD), and bitcom/USD
 

(BTC/USD). As is the case with trading foreign currencies on Defendant's platform, the first
asset is the asset being âboughtâ or âsoldâ with the price quoted in the second asset, USD.

34, Using MT on Defendantâs platform, U.S. customers can either buy or sell CFDs
(go âlongâ or âshortâ) referenced to the prices of foreign currencies, precious metals, and digital
assets on margin with leverages potentially as high as 1/500.

32, In this case, âmarginâ means the assets a customer deposits with the Defendant as
collateral, while âleverageâ allows a customer to control a large amount of a commodity with a
comparatively small amount of margin. Leverage also allows customers to significantly magnify
profits or losses with a relatively small investment.

33. In taking trading positions on Defendantâs platform, U.S. customers speculate on
the price movement of the underlying commodity and either profit or lose based on whether
prices move in their favor or not. There is no actual delivery of the underlying commodity and
customers close their positions by trading equal and opposite positions. Defendant automatically
closes customersâ positions when their losses reduce the value of assets they have deposited to
equal to or fess than five percent of the value of their open positions.

34. When one of Defendantâs agents was contacted by an individual who identified
himself as a U.S. customer, Defendantâs agent actively solicited that individual in this District by
email, and by phone through a U.S. phone number, to transact in CPDs referenced to the prices
of foreign currencies, precious metals, and digital assets on Defendantâs platform.

35, Defendant subsequently accepted orders placed by this U.S. individual on its
platform, from this District, and executed transactions, on a leveraged or margined basis using
bitcom as coHateral margin, in CFDs referencing the price of commodities. In these CFD

transactions, Defendant acted as the counterparty.

36. Defendant uses its YouTube channel as a further means of sohciting U.S.
customers. It does this through a promotional video that instructs customers on how to open a
trading account and by providing an âOpen Trading Accountâ hyperlink to PaxForexâs website.

37. PaxPorexâs YouTube channel, along with PaxForexâs website, also contains daily
videos, narrated by one of Defendantâs agents, which promote Defendantâs forecasts and
recommendations for making trades in specific commodities, and periodic videos that tout the
purported profitability of Defendantâs earher trading recommendations and associated forecasts.

38, Additionally, in a blogpost on its website, Defendant touts itself as âThe Best
Forex Broker for Beginners in the USA.â

39. Sumiarly, Defendant's website contains customer testimonials from two U.S.
customers, one of whom the website identifies as bemg from the United States, and further
purports to have a U.S. presence with its âIT Infrastructures [which] has been deployed within
industry leading datacenters in London... and New York.â

AQ, Minalfy, Defendant solicits customers, inchiding those in the United States,
through its âAffihateâ program. Through this program, Defendant incentivizes U.S. persons to
become âaffiliatesâ by providing them with commussions and other mecentives to solicit
customers to trade CFDs in forex and other commodities on Defendant's platform.

Ay, Defendant fails to check the ECP status of its customers during the customer
registration process. Moreover, Defendant solicits customers to open an account with an initial
deposit of as little as the equivalent of $10 to incentivize trading by retail customers who would

AO Through the above-described conduct, Defendant offers to enter into, or enters
into, and/or executes leveraged, margined or financed transactions in foreign currencies, precious
metals, and digital assets with non-ECP customers in the United States.

AS. Defendantâs platform is not a designated contract market or derivatives
transaction execution facility, exempt board of trade, or a bona fide foreign board of trade as
those terms are defined in the Act. Indeed in the âTerms and Conditions of business PaxForex
MT4,â which Defendant provides to customers, Defendant acknowledges that us platform is âthe
sole Execution Venue [for customersâ orders and trades] which is a nonregulated market.â

AA, As of the date of the filing of this Complaint, PaxForex has not been registered
with the Commission as an RCM,
