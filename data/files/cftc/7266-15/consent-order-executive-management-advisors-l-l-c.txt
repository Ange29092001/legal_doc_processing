I. INTRODUCTION
On September 23, 2014, Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading Commission

(âCommissionâ or âCFTCâ) filed a Complaint against Defendant John R. Bullar (âBullarâ) and
Executive Management Advisors L.L.C. (âEMAâ) or (âDefendantsâ) seeking injunctive and
other equitable relief, as well as the imposition of civil penalties, for violations of the
Commodity Exchange Act (âActâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1-26 (2012), and the Commissionâs Regulations
(âRegulationsâ) promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.1 et seg. (2014).

Bullar and EMA are Debtors in Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings pending in the United
States Court for the Southern District of Ohio captioned Jn re: Executive Management Advisors,
et al., Case No. 13-14741 and_In re: John R. Bullar Case No. 13-14740, Jointly Administered
Under Case No. 13-14741 (Bankr., S.D. Ohio 2013). Both cases were filed on October 11, 2013
and ordered jointly administered on October 18, 2013 (âBankruptcy Actionâ). On October 22,
Case: 1:14-cv-00755-MRB Doc #: 22 Filed: 09/25/15 Page: 2 of 28 PAGEID #: 207

2013, the Bankruptcy Court approved the appointment of Richard D. Nelson, Esq. (âNelsonâ) as
interim Chapter 7 trustee (âTrusteeâ), and subsequently as permanent Trustee in the jointly
administered bankruptcy cases.

On October 29, 2014, a Waiver of the Service of Summons (âWaiverâ) was sent to
Nelson, as bankruptcy Trustee for EMA pursuant to Rule 4(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure by overnight UPS delivery. The waiver was executed by Nelson as Trustee on behalf
of EMA and was filed with the Court on November 6, 2014. On December 29, 2014, EMA,
through Nelson as its Trustee, filed an Answer to the Complaint.

Bullar is also a defendant in a related criminal action entitled United States of America y.
Bullar, Case No. 1:14-cr-00086-MRB-1, United States District Court for the Southem District of
Ohio, filed on August 20, 2014 (âCriminal Actionâ). In the Criminal Action, Bullar waived
indictment and on September 23, 2014, entered a guilty plea to an Information to one count of

Case: 1:14-cv-00755-MRB Doc #: 22 Filed: 09/25/15 Page: 6 of 28 PAGEID #: 211

Other Related Entities

15. Executive Management of Greater Cincinnati, LTD (âEMGâ) is a limited liability
company organized in Ohio with a registered office in Cincinnati, Ohio. EMG has never been
registered with the Commission.

16. Priapus Group LLC (ââPriapusâ) is a limited liability company organized in Ohio
with a principal office in Cincinnati, Ohio. Priapus has never been registered with the
Commission.

Facts Establishin *s Violations of the Commodity Exchange Act

17. From at least March 11, 2009 through September 2013.(âRelevant Periodâ), EMA
solicited potential investors (CEMA Pool Participantsâ) located mainly in Cincinnati, Ohio.
EMA represented to EMA Pool Participants that their funds would be pooled for the purpose of
trading commodity futures and commodity options contracts. The Pool Participants included
members of a church group, friends and acquaintances.

18. EMA solicited potential EMA Pool Participants in person, by phone, email or
through the mail. EMA represented to EMA Pool Participants that EMA would make the trading
decisions for the pool, and EMA falsely held out its principal and/or employee as a successful
and exempt commodity trading advisor (âCTAâ).

19. EMA held out its principal and/or employee as a highly specialized managed
futures trader that had broad experience with trading floors at the Chicago Board of Trade and
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

20.  Asaresult of these solicitations and representations, approximately 40 EMA Pool
Participants invested at least $8,348,604 with the EMA Pool, some of whom also entered into an

EMA Managed Account Agreement (âEMA Investment Agreementâ). The EMA Investment

 
Case: 1:14-cv-00755-MRB Doc #: 22 Filed: 09/25/15 Page: 7 of 28 PAGEID #: 212

Agreement stated that the Pool Participants âappointed EMA or its authorized agent as [the Pool
Participantâs] attorney-in-fact with respect to the account to buy, sell or otherwise trade in
commodities, commodity futures contracts [and] ... commodity options ....â The EMA
Investment Agreement also provided that EMA would open accounts for the Pool Participants
âthrough EMAâ at a registered futures commission merchant (âFCMâ) and that EMA would
only be entitled to a monthly incentive fee based on a percentage of the Pool Participantsâ trading
profits. The incentive fee fluctuated depending on the agreement EMA reached with each Pool
Participant. The EMA Investment Agreement did not provide for any other fees to be paid to
EMA or for the benefit of its principal and/or employee.

21. BMA directed EMA Pool Participants to send their funds by check or wire into
three EMA bank accounts and one EMG bank account (collectively called the âEMA-EMG
Bank Accountsâ) held at three financial institutions. EMAâs principal was a signatory to all
EMA-EMG Bank Accounts.

22. Most of the funds received from the EMA Pool Participants and deposited in the
EMA-EMG Bank Accounts for the purpose of trading commodity futures or commodity options
contracts were not traded at all. Instead, $6,209,185 of the EMA Pool Participant funds were
misappropriated or embezzled by EMA.

Fands Traded

23. EMA traded a fraction of the funds solicited and obtained from Pool Participants
at accounts opened and maintained at FCMs MF Global and R.J. OâBrien (âRJOâ) (together,

âEMA Trading Accountsâ) and misappropriated and embezzled the remainder of the funds.
Case: 1:14-cv-00755-MRB Doc #: 22 Filed: 09/25/15 Page: 8 of 28 PAGEID #: 213

24. From April 2009 through November 2011, EMA opened and traded five EMA
Trading Accounts at MF Global and from November 2011 through July 2013, EMA opened and
traded six EMA Trading accounts at RJO.

25. The EMA Trading Accounts traded commodity futures, including indexes, soft
commodities, metals, energy, notes, and on exchange currency; and in commodity options
contracts, soft commodities, metals, bonds, and on exchange currency were traded.

26. EMA represented to EMA Pool Participants that their trades cleared through MF
Global, RJO and Rosenthal Collins (âRosenthalâ) through June 2013. Despite representing to
EMA Pool Participants that EMA was trading at Rosenthal there was in fact no trading
conducted at all by EMA at Rosenthal for at least five years prior to the collapse of this scheme
in September 2013.

27. In total, $786,941.21 was deposited and traded through the EMA Trading
Accounts and $230,155.53 was lost through trading activity and fees. The remaining funds in
the EMA Trading Accounts were either returned to the EMA-EMG bank accounts or used for
purposes other than the benefit of the EMA Pool Participants.

Material Misrepresentations and Omissions Regarding the Use of Funds

28. BMA knowingly failed to disclose to the EMA Pool Participants that all of their
funds would not be invested and traded. Instead, EMA invested only a small portion of their
funds and used the remaining amount for its own purposes.

29. EMA knowingly failed to disclose to the EMA Pool Participants that it was
misappropriating their funds.

30. | EMA provided false account statements to the EMA Pool Participants that

showed fictitious profits, account balances and other false information relating to their
Case: 1:14-cv-00755-MRB Doc #: 22 Filed: 09/25/15 Page: 9 of 28 PAGEID #: 214

investments. Indeed, EMA made these misrepresentations on the account statements to conceal
the misappropriation of funds and trading losses from the Pool Participants.

31. EMA knowingly failed to disclose to the EMA Pool Participants that their funds
were being used to pay certain Pool Participants their fictitious trading profits and/or
withdrawals of their principal.

32. EMA misrepresented to at least some EMA Pool Participants that their funds were
being invested through a poo] and that they would be receiving an allocation of the profits
proportionate to the amount they invested in the pool. This representation was false since any
funds the Pool Participants received were mostly, if not fully, paid by the funds contributed by
the Pool Participants and not from trading profits. For example, from July 2009 through August
2010, EMA Trading Accounts suffered only trading losses, but EMA made payments of
purported profits to at least some EMA Pool Participants from Pool Participant Funds.

33. In short, EMA intentionally or recklessly misrepresented or omitted disclosing to
EMA Pool Participants the manner in which their funds were or would be used or traded.

34. Statements and omissions made by EMA set forth above were material
misstatements and misrepresentations as well as fraudulent omissions.

Misappropriation and Embezzlement of the EMA Pool Participantsâ Funds

35. EMA solicited and received at least $8,348,604 from Pool Participants. Only
$786,941.21 was transferred to EMA Trading Accounts for trading commodity futures and
commodity options.. A total of $230,155.53 was lost through trading and fees. EMA returned.
$2,334,805.38 to some EMA Pool Participants, of which $195,385.58 was in excess of the
principal the EMA Pool Participants invested. The difference between the amount fraudulently

solicited and directly obtained by Bullar, $8,348,604, and the net amount returned to customers,
Case: 1:14-cv-00755-MRB Doc #: 22 Filed: 09/25/15 Page: 10 of 28 PAGEID #: 215

$2,139,419 (total amount returned of Â§2,334,805.38 minus the amount returned in excess of
EMA Pool Participantsâ principal, $195,385.58), is $6,209,185, the amount misappropriated and
embezzled by EMA.

36. Most of the EMA Pool Participantsâ funds in the EMA-EMG Bank Accounts
were used to pay for its principalâs personal expenses, to make cash withdrawals, to issue checks
to its principal, and to transfer money to its principalâs personal accounts, or to two Priapus
Accounts -- accounts controlled by EMAâs principal and used to purchase property and vehicles,
to pay for landscaping and other home improvements.

37. Inamanner typical of a Ponzi scheme, EMA also used certain EMA Pool
Participant funds to pay for other EMA Pool Participantsâ withdrawals of principal or fictitious
profits.

False Reports of EMAâs Trading Performance and the Value of EMAâs Investor
Accounts

38. | Throughout the Relevant Period, EMA sent or caused to be sent to EMA Pool
Participants an âExecutive Management Advisors L.L.C. Account Statementâ (âEMA Account
Statementâ) that purported to show the beginning balance, total gross profit/loss, total
deposits/withdrawals, total margin requirements, total open trade positions, and total account
ending balance for each Pool Participant.

39. The EMA Account Statements always showed that âtotal gross profitsâ increased
on a quarterly basis. For example, an EMA Account Statement sent to one EMA Pool
Participant showed the following gross profits every quarter for 2012: Q1 2012: $3,635.00; Q2
2012: $4,088.00; Q3 2012: 4,387.00 and Q4 2012: $5,130.00. These gross profits, as well as the

âbeginning balanceâ that incorporated these gross profits in the following quarter, were fictitious.

10
Case: 1:14-cv-00755-MRB Doc #: 22 Filed: 09/25/15 Page: 11 of 28 PAGEID #: 216

40. Similarly, the EMA Account Statements showed fictitious values for the âTotal
Account Ending Balance.â For example, the account statement for an EMA Pool Participant
listed increases in his âTotal Account Ending Balanceâ from $315,643.55 in the 2011 fourth
quarter to $454,690.37 in the 2012 fourth quarter. This ending balance was false since it was
more than the total amount of EMA Pooled funds in all trading accounts for this very same
fourth quarter of 2012, which totaled only $160,674.19.

41. Also, since at least 2012, EMA sent or caused to be sent to EMA Pool
Participants an EMA âDeposit Formâ (âEMA Deposit Formâ) that purported to show the date
when EMA Pool Participant funds were âreceived by E.M.A.â and the date when the funds were
âentered into active trading.â For example, on September 20, 2013, one EMA Pool Participant
sent a wire transfer in the amount of $80,000 to EMA. The EMA Deposit Form received by this
Pool Participant showed that this EMA Pool Participantâs funds were âentered into active
tradingâ on September 20, 2013. A review of EMA Trading Accounts shows this to be false.
The funds were never deposited into the EMA Trading Accounts.

42. EMA Pool Participants relied on the false information in the EMA Account
Statements and as a result made decisions to deposit funds with EMA, decided not to withdraw
their investments, and/or made additional investments with EMA. Further, EMA sent, or caused
to be sent, the EMA Account Statements and EMA Deposit forms to Pool Participants knowing
they contained false information.

Collapse of EMA.

43. On March 7, 2013, an EMA Pool Participant made an $800,000 withdrawal of his
investment. To partially fund this request, $150,000 was withdrawn from one of the EMA

11
Case: 1:14-cv-00755-MRB Doc #: 22 Filed: 09/25/15 Page: 12 of 28 PAGEID #: 217

Trading Accounts at RJO. This withdrawal left this EMA Trading Account with a negative total
balance of ($103,366.24).

44. On July 1, 2013, EMA, through its principal, emailed the EMA Trading Account
manager at RJO stating that â$35Kâ was needed from the accounts and the funds need to be
wired âasap.â

45. OnJuly 3, 2013, RJO wired $30,081.50 to one of the EMA-EMG Bank Accounts,
leaving four trading accounts with a zero balance, one account with a negative ($5.00) balance,
and one remaining trading account with only $75.

46. On September 17, 2013, EMA accepted a $427,293.57 deposit from an EMA Pool
Participant (âParticipant 1â) for the purpose of trading futures and commodity option contracts.
Three days later, on September 20, 2013, EMA accepted an $80,000 deposit from another EMA
Pool Participant (âParticipant 2â). In both instances, EMA failed to disclose to Participant 1 and
Participant 2 that the EMA Trading Accounts were no longer trading. Further, EMA failed to
transfer their deposits to the EMA Trading Accounts.

EMA Failed to Register as CPO and CTA

47. During the Relevant Period, without registering as a commodity pool operator
(âCPOâ), EMA acted as a CPO by engaging in a business that was of the nature of a commodity
pool, an investment trust, syndicate, or similar form of enterprise, and, in connection therewith,
solicited, accepted, or received from others, funds, securities, or property, either directly or
through capital contributions, the sale of stock or other forms of securities, or otherwise, for the
purpose of trading in commodities for future delivery and commodity options, and made use of

the mails or any means of interstate commerce in connection with EMAâs business as a CPO.

12
Case: 1:14-cv-00755-MRB Doc #: 22 Filed: 09/25/15 Page: 13 of 28 PAGEID #: 218

48. During the Relevant Period, without registering as a CTA, EMA also acted as a
CTA by engaging in the business of advising others, either directly or through publications,
writings, or electronic media, as to the value of or the advisability of trading in any contract of
sale of a commodity for future delivery and advisability of trading in any commodity options for
compensation or profit. Further, the mails or any means of interstate commerce were used in
connection with EMAâs business as a CTA.

which was received from any customer, client, or pool participant in connection with the

A. Restitution
61. EMA shall pay restitution in the amount of six million two hundred nine thousand
one hundred eighty five dollars ($6,209,185) (âRestitution Obligationâ), plus post-judgment
interest. Post-judgment interest shall accrue on the Restitution Obligation beginning on the date
of entry of this Consent Order and shall be determined by using the Treasury Bill rate prevailing
on the date of entry of this Consent Order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1961 (2012). The redacted
names of the EMA Pool Participants and the amount owed to each are attached as Exhibit A to
this Consent Order, which is hereby incorporated as if fully set forth herein (the âListâ). An
unredacted List has also been provided to Chambers for in camera review, to the parties in this
case, and to the Court Appointed Monitor. The unredacted List is also incorporated by reference
as if fully set forth herein.
62. Defendant Bullar is currently the defendant in the Criminal Action and Bullar and
EMA are the Debtors in the Bankruptcy Action referenced above. For amounts disbursed to the
EMA Pool Participants as a result of satisfaction of any restitution ordered in the Criminal
Action and/or amounts disbursed to EMA Pool Participants in the Bankruptcy Action, EMA.
shall receive a dollar-for-dollar credit against its Restitution Obligation only if those
disbursements made in the Criminal Action and/or in the Bankruptcy Action were for amounts
owed to the same EMA Pool Participants and for the Relevant Period identified in paragraph 17
of this Consent Order. Restitution payments made by Bullar for amounts owed to EMA Pool

Participants prior to the Relevant Period will not receive any credit against EMAâs Restitution

19
Case: 1:14-cv-00755-MRB Doc #: 22 Filed: 09/25/15 Page: 20 of 28 PAGEID #: 225

Obligation. Within ten (10) days of disbursement in the Criminal Action or the Bankruptcy
Action to the EMA Pool Participants, EMA shall, under a cover letter that identifies the name
and docket number of this proceeding, transmit to the Chief Financial Officer, Commodity
Futures Trading Commission, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street, NW, Washington, D.C.
20581, copies of the form of payment to those pool participants.

63. To effect payment of the Restitution Obligation and the distribution of any
restitution payments to EMA Pool Participants, the Court appoints the National Futures
Association (âNFAâ) as Monitor (âMonitorâ). The Monitor shall collect restitution payments
from EMA and make distributions as set forth below. Because the Monitor is acting as an officer
of this Court in performing these services, the NFA shall not be liable for any action or inaction
arising from NFAâs appointment as Monitor, other than actions involving fraud.

64. EMA shall make Restitution Obligation payments under this Consent Order to the
Monitor in the name âEMA SETTLEMENT/ RESTITUTION Fundâ and shall send such
Restitution Obligation payments by electronic funds transfer, or by U.S. postal money order,
certified check, bank cashierâs, or bank money order, to the Office of Administration, National
Futures Association, 300 South Riverside Plaza, Suite 1800, Chicago, Ilinois 60606 under cover
letter that identifies EMA, as payor, and the name and docket number of this proceeding. EMA

Financial Officer, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Three Lafayette Contre, 1155 21st

to determine the manner of distribution of such funds in an equitable fashion to EMA Pool

Participants identified by the Commission or may defer distribution until such time as the

20
Case: 1:14-cv-00755-MRB Doc #: 22 Filed: 09/25/15 Page: 21 of 28 PAGEID #: 226

Monitor deems appropriate. In the event that the amount of Restitution Obligation payments to
the Monitor are of a de minimis nature such that the Monitor determines that the administrative
cost of making a distribution to eligible EMA Pool Participants is impractical, the Monitor may,
in its discretion, treat such restitution payments as civil monetary penalty payments, which the
Monitor shall forward to the Commission following the instructions for civil monetary penalty
payments set forth in Part B below.

66. | EMA shall cooperate with the Monitor as appropriate to provide such information
as the Monitor deems necessary and appropriate to identify EMA Pool Participants to whom the
Monitor, in its sole discretion, may determine to include in any plan for distribution of any
Restitution Obligation payments. EMA shall execute any documents necessary to release funds
that it has in any repository, bank, investment or other financial institution, wherever located, in
order to make partial or total payment toward the Restitution Obligation.

67. The Monitor shall provide the Commission at the beginning of each calendar year
with a report detailing the disbursement of funds to EMA Pool Participants during the previous
year. The Monitor shall transmit this report under a cover letter that identifies the name and
docket number of this proceeding to the Chief Financial Officer, Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20581.

68. | The amounts payable to each EMA Pool Participant shall not limit the ability of
any EMA Poo! Participant to prove that a greater amount is owed from EMA or any other person
or entity, and nothing herein shall be construed in any way to limit or abridge the rights of any
EMA Pool Participant that exist under state or common law.

69. Pursuant to Rule 71 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, each EMA Pool

Participant who suffered a loss is explicitly made an intended third-party beneficiary of this

21

Consent Order and may seek to enforce obedience of this Consent Order to obtain satisfaction of
any portion of the restitution that has not been paid by EMA to ensure continued compliance
with any provision of this Consent Order and to hold EMA in contempt for any violations of any
provision of this Consent Order.

B. Civil Monetary Penalty

70. | EMA shall pay a civil monetary penalty in the amount of six million two hundred
nine thousand one hundred eighty five dollars ($6,209,185) (âCMP Obligationâ), plus post-
judgment interest. Post-judgment interest shall accrue on the CMP Obligation beginning on the
date of entry of this Consent Order and shall be determined by using the Treasury Bill rate
prevailing on the date of entry of this Consent Order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1961 (2012).

71. EMA shall pay its CMP Obligation by electronic funds transfer, U.S. postal
