ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTION 6(c) AND (d) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, MAKING
FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

I. INTRODUCTION

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ) has reason to believe that
from in or about January 2018 to at least January 2021 (âRelevant Periodâ), Amaggi ExportagÃ©o
e Importacdo Ltda. âRespondentâ or âAmaggiâ) violated Regulation 19.01, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 19.01
(2020). Therefore, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest that public
administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted to determine whether Respondent
engaged in the violations set forth herein and to determine whether any order should be issued
imposing remedial sanctions.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Respondent has
submitted an Offer of Settlement (âOfferâ), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Without admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, Respondent consents to
the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Section 6(c) and (d) of the Commodity
Exchange Act, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (âOrderâ), and
acknowledges service of this Order.!

 

' Respondent consents to the use of the findings of fact and conclusions of law in this Order in this
proceeding and in any other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a
party or claimant, and agrees that they shall be taken as true and correct and be given preclusive effect
therein, without further proof. Respondent does not consent, however, to the use of this Order, or the
findings or conclusions herein, as the sole basis for any other proceeding brought by the Commission or
to which the Commission is a party or claimant, other than: a proceeding in bankruptcy or receivership;
or a proceeding to enforce the terms of this Order. Respondent does not consent to the use of the Offer or
this Order, or the findings or conclusions in this Order, by any other party in any other proceeding.
I. FINDINGS
The Commission finds the following:
A. SUMMARY

During the Relevant Period, Respondent failed on at least thirteen occasions to file CFTC
Form 204 reports setting forth the composition of their fixed price soybean positions, as required
by Regulations 19.00(a)(1) and 19.01, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 19.00(a)(1), 19.01 (2020), until being
prompted by Commission staff to file them. Moreover, on at least eight of those occasions, the
Form 204s filed by Respondent contained inaccurate information that Respondent did not correct
until February 2021.

B. RESPONDENT

Amaggi Exportac4o e Importacao Ltda. is a private company formed in Brazil and part
of the Grupo Amaggi, one of the largest soybean producers in the world. Amaggi has never been
registered with the Commission.

C. FACTS

During at least thirteen months during the Relevant Period, Respondent held or controlled
soybean futures positions that were reportable pursuant to Regulation 15.00(p)(2), 17 C.F.R.
Â§ 15.00(p)(2) (2020), and, based on records provided by Respondent, constituted bona fide
hedging positions as defined in Regulation 1.3, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.3 (2020). Therefore, Respondent
was required to file Form 204 reports within three business days of the last Friday of each such
month pursuant to Regulations 19.00(a)(1) and 19.01, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 19.00(a)(1), 19.01 (2020).
On all thirteen of these occasions, however, Respondent failed to timely file the Form 204
reports and did not file the reports until prompted by Commission staff.2 In addition, eight of the
Form 204s submitted by Respondent incorrectly stated its soybean positions. After Commission
staff identified likely errors in the reports Respondent filed, Respondent submitted corrected
Form 204s in February 2021.

Hl. LEGAL DISCUSSION

Regulation 19.00(a)(1), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 19.00(a)(1) (2020), requires that persons holding or
controlling futures and options positions in certain agricultural commodities that are reportable
pursuant to Regulation 15.00(p)(2), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 15.00(p)(2) (2020), and any part of which
constitute bona fide hedging positions as defined in Regulation 1.3, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.3 (2020), must
file Form 204 reports showing the composition of the fixed price cash position of each such
commodity hedged (the âForm 204 commodities,â which include wheat, corn, oats, soybeans,
soybean oil, and soybean meal).* Reportable positions under Regulation 15.00(p)(2) are any

 

* Respondent failed to file timely Form 204 reports for the following months: JanuaryâMay 2018,
October 2019, April-June 2020, and October 2020âJanuary 2021.

> On October 15, 2020, the Commission adopted a new rule that, inter alia, prospectively will relieve
hedgers of the obligation to file Form 204s because the Commission will collect the relevant data from
combined futures and futures-equivalent option open contract positions as defined in Part 150 of
the Regulations, 17 C.F.R. pt. 150 (2020), in any one month or in all months combined, either
net long or net short in any commodity on any one reporting market, which positions at the close
of the market on the last business day of the week exceed the net quantity limit in spot, single, or
all-months fixed in Regulation 150.2, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 150.2 (2020), for the Form 204 commodities.

The filing requirement is longstanding. In fact, in 2013, the CFTCâs Division of Market
Oversight issued an advisory regarding the obligation of market participants to submit accurate
Form 204 Reports. See CFTC Staff Advisory No. 13-42, Obligation of Reportable Market
Participants to File CFTC Form 204 Reports (July 8, 2013). As noted, a purpose of the Form
204 report has been to check compliance with speculative position limits by ensuring that filers
that classify their futures positions as hedging actually own or control offsetting cash positions.

By failing to timely file Form 204 reports on thirteen occasions, including eight reports
that failed to accurately report Respondentâs fixed price cash positions of each commodity
hedged, as set forth above, Respondent violated Regulation 19.01, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 19.01 (2020).

IV. FINDINGS OF VIOLATIONS

Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that, during the Relevant Period,
Respondent violated Regulation 19.01, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 19.01 (2020).

2. A hearing;

3. All post-hearing procedures;

204s until exchanges implement the new reporting regime required under the rule, no later than January 1,
2022. Id. at 3248-49.
