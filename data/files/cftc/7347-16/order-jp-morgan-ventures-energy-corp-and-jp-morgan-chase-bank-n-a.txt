ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTION 6(c) AND 6(d) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT,
MAKING FINDINGS AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

I.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ) has reason to believe that
from at least March 1, 2013 through April 30, 2014 (the âRelevant Periodâ), JP Morgan Ventures
Energy Corporation (âJPVECâ) and JP Morgan Chase Bank N.A. (âJPCBâ) (collectively,
âRespondentsâ) violated Section 4s(f) of the Commodity Exchange Act (the âActâ),

7 U.S.C. Â§ 6s(f) (2012), and Commission Regulations (âRegulationsâ) 20.4 and 20.7,

17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 20.4 and 20.7 (2015). Therefore, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the
public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted to determine
whether Respondents engaged in the violations set forth herein, and to determine whether any
order should be issued imposing remedial sanctions.

Il.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Respondents have
submitted an Offer of Settlement of Respondents JP Morgan Ventures Energy Corporation and
JP Morgan Chase Bank N.A. (âOfferâ) that the Commission has determined to accept. Without
admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, Respondents consent to the entry
of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 6(c) and 6(d) of the Commodity
Exchange Act, Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (âOrderâ) and acknowledge
service of this Order.

 

Respondents consent to the entry of this Order and to the use of these findings in this proceeding and in any
other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party; provided, however, that
Respondents do not consent to the use of the Offer or the findings or conclusions in this Order consented to in the
Offer, as the sole basis for any other proceeding brought by the Commission, other than a proceeding in bankruptcy
or to enforce the terms of this Order. Nor do Respondents consent to the use of the Offer or this Order, or the
findings or conclusions in this Order consented to in the Offer, by any other party in any other proceeding.
III.
The Commission finds the following:
A. SUMMARY

Pursuant to Section 4s(f), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6s(f), and Regulation 20.4, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 20.4, Swap
Dealers that meet certain requirements are required to file daily large trader reports for reportable
positions in physical commodity swaps (âLTRsâ), which are populated with specific data as
directed by the Commission. The LTRs must also conform to the form and manner for reporting
and submitting information as set forth in Regulation 20.7, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 20.7.

During the Relevant Period, Respondents filed LTRs which failed to comply with certain
Commission requirements. On January 2, 2014, the Commissionâs Division of Market Oversight
issued special call notices to JPVEC and JPCB that identified multiple apparent instances of such
noncompliance in the LTRs submitted by Respondents (âSpecial Callsâ). After receiving the
Special Calls, Respondents implemented changes to their reporting procedures and submitted
corrected historical reports.

B. RESPONDENTS

Respondents are headquartered in New York and have been provisionally registered with
the Commission as Swap Dealers (âSDsâ) since December 31, 2012.

C. FACTS

As provisionally registered SDs, Respondents were required to submit LTRs in the form
and manner determined by the Commission during the Relevant Period.â Despite that obligation,
Respondents submitted LTRs that routinely contained errors, and they failed to submit LTRs on
two days. Respondents submitted reports that included errors such as (1) reporting the
underlying commodity, futures equivalent months, and currency value strike price in the wrong
data fields; (2) reporting futures contract equivalents, commodity units, and notional values that
were incorrect or missing; and (3) providing identifying information for principals that attributed
positions to the wrong entities; and (4) incorrectly reporting counterparty names. As a result of
these errors, Respondents submitted LTRs throughout the Relevant Period that inaccurately
reported Respondentsâ positions in various commodities. Moreover, in many instances, the data
processing and reporting systems used by Respondents to generate the LTRs did not detect these
errors before Respondents submitted the LTRs to the Commissionâs Division of Market
Oversight (DMO). Accordingly, Respondentsâ LTRs did not comply with the requirements
governing Part 20 Reports, which are set forth in Regulations 20.4 and 20.7, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 20.4 &
20.7, in conjunction with further instructions provided in the Large Trader Reporting for

 

2 The Part 20 rules became effective on September 20, 2011. Following the promulgation of the Part 20

rules, the Commissionâs Division of Market Oversight, through a series of no-action letters, provided temporary
relief from these reporting requirements and certain safe-harbor provisions. However, by March 1, 2013, such relief
was no longer available and Respondents were required to be in full compliance with the Part 20 reporting
requirements.
Physical Commodity Swaps: Division of Market Oversight Guidebook for Part 20 Reports
(âPart 20 Guidebookâ).

In accepting Respondentsâ Offer, the Commission recognizes Respondentsâ cooperation
in this matter. Throughout the Relevant Period, Respondents communicated with DMO
regarding issues with their LTRs. In response to DMOâs Special Calls, Respondents analyzed
their past reports and made modifications to their data processing and reporting systems as
necessary to comply with their LTR reporting requirements. Respondents also corrected errors
as they were identified and submitted corrected historical LTRs.

IV.
LEGAL DISCUSSION

Pursuant to Section 4s(f)(1)(A) of the Act: âEach registered swap dealer and major swap
participant .. . shall make such reports as are required by the Commission by rule or regulation
regarding the transactions and positions and financial condition of the registered swap dealer or
major swap participant.â 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6s(f). Regulation 20.4(c) provides certain enumerated data
elements that must be included in a SDâs data report. 17 C.F.R. Â§ 20.4(c) (2015). These data
elements include, among others: the commodity underlying the reportable positions, the
commodity reference price, futures equivalent month, long paired swap positions and short
paired swap positions, swaption strike price, name of the counterparty, and an identifier
indicating that a principal or counterparty position is being reported.

Large trader reporting for physical commodity swaps is essential to the Commissionâs
ability to conduct effective surveillance of markets in U.S. physical commodity futures and
economically equivalent swaps. Failure to comply with the reporting specifications set forth by
the Commission hinders the Commissionâs ability to efficiently process and effectively utilize
this critical data.

Regulation 20.7 provides, in relevant part: âUnless otherwise instructed by the
Commission, a clearing organization or reporting entity shall submit data records and any other
information required under this part to the Commission .. . (a) Using the format, coding
structure, and electronic data transmission procedures approved in writing by the Commission.â
17 C.F.R. Â§ 20.7 (2015). The prescribed manner and form of reporting and submitting swaps
data is provided in the Part 20 Guidebook.â

Respondents provisionally registered as SDs on December 31, 2012 and consequently
were required to submit LTRs during the Relevant Period. LTRs submitted by Respondents
omitted required data elements and reported certain data in a manner that did not conform to the
specifications required by the Commission. Additionally, for two days during the Relevant
Period, Respondents failed to submit required LTRs altogether. Accordingly, Respondents

 

3 As provided for in Regulation 20.8, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 20.8 (2015), the Commission delegated certain authority to

the Director of DMO or others as the Director may designate from time to time. This delegated authority includes
the authority pursuant to Regulation 20.7 âfor providing instructions or determining the format, coding structure,
and electronic data transmission procedures for submitting data records and any other information required under
[part 20}.â
violated Section 4s(f) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6s(f), and Regulations 20.4 and 20.7, 17 C.F.R.
Â§Â§ 20.4 & 20.7.

V.
FINDINGS OF VIOLATIONS

Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that Respondents violated Section 4s(f) of
the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6s(f) (2012), and Regulations 20.4 and 20.7, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 20.4 & 20.7
(2015).
