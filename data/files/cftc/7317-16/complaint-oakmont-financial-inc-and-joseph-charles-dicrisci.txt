Plaintiff U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionââ) alleges as

follows:
I. SUMMARY

l. From at least July 16, 2011, and continuing through at least July 27, 2012 (the
âRelevant Periodâ), Defendant Oakmont Financial, Inc. (âOakmontâ), by and through the actions
of its employees and agents, including but not limited to Defendant Joseph Charles DiCrisci
(âDiCrisciâ) (collectively, âDefendantsâ), entered into, offered to enter into, or conducted any
office or business in the United States for the purpose of soliciting or accepting any order for the
purchase or sale of precious metals from retail customers on a leveraged or financed basis.
These transactions constituted illegal, off-exchange retail commodity transactions. By this
conduct, Defendants have engaged, are engaging, or are about to engage in conduct that violates
Sections 4(a) and 4d(a) of the Commodity Exchange Act (âActâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6(a) and 6d(a)

(2012).
Case 9:16-cv-80055-XXXX Document1 Entered on FLSD Docket 01/12/2016 Page 2 of 14

2. DiCrisci controlled Oakmont throughout the Relevant Period and failed to act in
good faith or knowingly induced Oakmontâs violations alleged herein. DiCrisci is therefore
liable for Oakmontâs violations pursuant to Section 13(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13c(b) (2012).

3. At all relevant times, the acts-and omissions of DiCrisci and other managers,
employees, and agents of Oakmont were committed within the scope of their employment,
agency, or office with Oakmont; therefore, Oakmont is liable under Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the
Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(a)(1)(B) (2012), and Commission Regulation (âRegulationâ) 1.2, 17 C.F.R.

Â§ 1.2 (2015), as a principal for the actions and omissions of DiCrisci and any other manager,
employee, or agent of Oakmont, in violation of the Act.

4. Pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2012), the Commission
brings this action to enjoin Defendantsâ unlawful acts and practices, to compel compliance with
the Act, and to further enjoin them from engaging in any commodity-related activity.

5. In addition, the Commission seeks civil monetary penalties, restitution, and
remedial ancillary relief, including but not limited to, trading and registration bans,
disgorgement, rescission, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, and such other relief as the
Court may deem necessary and appropriate.

6. Unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, Defendants are likely to continue to
engage in the acts and practices alleged in this Complaint, or similar acts and practices, as more
fully described below.

Il. JURISDICTION AND VENUE
7. Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1, authorizes the Commission to seek

injunctive relief against any person whenever it shall appear to the Commission that such person
Case 9:16-cv-80055-XXXX Document1 Entered on FLSD Docket 01/12/2016 Page 3 of 14

has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a violation of
any provision of the Act, or any rule, regulation, or order thereunder.
8. The Commission has jurisdiction over the conduct and transactions at issue in this
case pursuant to Sections 2(c)(2)(D) and 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 2(c)(2)(D) and 13a-1 (2012).
9, Venue properly lies with the Court pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
Â§ 13a-1(e) (2012), because Defendants transacted business in this District, and certain
transactions, acts, and practices alleged in this Complaint occurred, are occurring, or are about to

occur within this District.

il. THE PARTIES
A. Plaintiff

10. ~â Plaintiff U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an independent
federal regulatory agency charged by Congress with the administration and enforcement of the
Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1 et seg. (2012), and the Regulations promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1.1
et seq. (2015).

B. Defendants

11. Defendant Oakmont Financial, Inc. was a Florida corporation formed in October
2010 that was administratively dissolved in September 2012. Its principal place of business was
Boynton Beach, Florida. Oakmont was a telemarketing firm that solicited retail customers to
invest in off-exchange retail commodity transactions. Oakmont has never been registered with
the Commission in any capacity.

12. Defendant Joseph Charles DiCrisci is a resident of New York, New York.
DiCrisci was an owner, principal, and controlling person of Oakmont. During the Relevant

Period, DiCrisci was not registered with the Commission.
Case 9:16-cv-80055-XXXX Documenti Entered on FLSD Docket 01/12/2016 Page 4 of 14

13. For most of the period from February 2002 through March 2005, DiCrisci was
registered as an associated person with several introducing brokers registered with the
Commission. From November 2003 through March 2005, he was also listed as a principal of
one of those firms, which he owned and controlled. On or about May 26, 2005, the National
Futures Association (âNFAâ) Business Conduct Committee issued a complaint alleging that:

1) DiCrisci, his firm, and his employee made deceptive and misleading sales solicitations; and â
2) DiCrisci and his firm failed to supervise his employee in connection with such activity. On or
about December 20, 2005, an NFA Hearing Panel issued a decision barring DiCrisci from NFA
membership or associated membership and from acting as a principal of an NFA member for one
year. Among other things, the panel ordered DiCrisci to pay a $10,000 fine if, after the
expiration of his one-year membership bar, he were granted NFA membership or associated
membership or became a principal of an NFA member. The panel also ordered DiCrisci to tape
record, for six months, all conversations between himself and existing or potential customers and
to retain the tapes for one year from the time they were created if he again became an NFA
member or associate. Finally, the panel ordered that in the event DiCrisci became a principal of
an NFA member, DiCrisci would be required to cause all associated persons of that firm, and of
any other firm of which he became a principal, to tape record, for six months, all conversations
that occurred between all associated persons and existing or potential customers and to retain the
tapes for one year from the time they were created.

14. QOnor about July 13, 2010, the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer
Services issued an Informal Settlement and Immediate Final Order to Cease and Desist Specified
Telemarking Activities against DiCrisci and an entity he owned and controlled that sold

investments in precious metals by telephone for: 1) failing to register as a Florida commercial
Case 9:16-cv-80055-XXXX Document1 Entered on FLSD Docket 01/12/2016 Page 5 of 14

telephone seller; and 2) employing fourteen individuals who failed register as Florida
commercial telephone salespersons. DiCrisci and his firm were ordered to pay a $10,000 fine
and to comply with Floridaâs telemarking licensing requirements.

IV. RELATED ENTITIES

15. | Oakmont introduced customers to Hunter Wise Commodities, LLC (âHunter
Wiseâ), which held itself out as a precious metals wholesaler and clearing firm. Hunter Wise
purported to confirm the execution of customer off-exchange retail commodity transactions.

16. | Hunter Wise was organized as a California limited liability company in July 2007
and was registered to do business in Nevada. It maintained business addresses in Las Vegas,
Nevada and Irvine, California. On its website, Hunter Wise held itself out as âa physical
commodity trading company, wholesaler, market maker, back-office support provider, and
finance company.â Hunter Wise purported to offer, enter into, and confirm the execution of
retail commodity transactions involving gold, silver, platinum, palladium, and copper throughout
the United States using a network of telemarketing solicitors such as Oakmont that it referred to
as âdealers.â

17. On February 19, 2014, a court in this District, in an action captioned CFTC v.
Hunter Wise Commodities, LLC, held that Hunter Wise and other defendants violated Section
4(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§6(a), the prohibition against off-exchange trading of retail commodity
transactions like the ones at issue here. The court granted summary judgment in favor of the
Commission. 1 F. Supp. 3d 1311, 1320-1322 (S.D. Fla. 2014).

V. STATUTORY BACKGROUND
18. Section 2(c)(2)(D) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§2(c)(2)(D), gives the Commission

jurisdiction over âany agreement, contract, or transaction in any commodityâ that is entered into
Case 9:16-cv-80055-XXXX Document1 Entered on FLSD Docket 01/12/2016 Page 6 of 14

with, or offered to, a non-eligible contract participant âon a leveraged or margined basis, or
financed by the offeror, the counterparty, or a person acting in concert with the offeror or
counterparty on a similar basisâ (âretail commodity transactionsâ) with respect to conduct
occurring on or after July 16, 2011, subject to certain exceptions not applicable here. Section
2(c)(2)(D) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(c)(2)(D), makes Section 4(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§6(a),
applicable to retail commodity transactions âas ifâ such transactions are contracts for the sale of
a commodity for future delivery.

19. The Act defines an eligible contract participant (âECPââ), in relevant part, as an
individual who has amounts invested on a discretionary basis, the aggregate of which exceeds
$10 million, or $5 million if the individual enters into the transaction to manage the risk
associated with an asset owned or liability incurred, or reasonably likely to be owned or incurred, â
by the individual. Section 1(a)(18)(xi) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1a(18)(xi) (2012). During the
Relevant Period, Oakmont solicited non-ECP customers to enter into retail commodity
transactions and executed retail commodity transactions with non-ECP customers.

20. Section 4(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6(a), in relevant part, makes it is unlawful for
any person to offer to enter into, execute, confirm the execution of, or conduct any office or
business anywhere in the United States for the purpose of soliciting, accepting any order for, or
otherwise dealing in any transaction in, or in connection with, a contract for the purchase or sale
of a commodity for future delivery unless the transaction is conducted on or subject to the rules
of a board of trade that has been designated or registered by the Commission as a contract
market.

21. Section 4d(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6d(a), in relevant part, provides that it shall

be unlawful for any person to be a futures commission merchant (âFCMâ) unless such person
Case 9:16-cv-80055-XXXX Document1 Entered on FLSD Docket 01/12/2016 Page 7 of 14

shall have registered with the Commission as an FCM. In pertinent part, Regulation 1.3(p),
17 C.F.R Â§ 1.3(p) (2015), defines an FCM as â[a]ny individual, association, partnership,
corporation, or trust... engaged in soliciting or in accepting orders for. . . any agreement,
contract, or transaction described in section 2(c)(2)(C)(i) or section 2(c)(2)(D)(i) of the Act... .â
See also Section 1a(28) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1a(28) (2012) (defining an FCM).

V1. FACTS

22. During the Relevant Period, Oakmont operated as a telemarketing firm that
solicited retail customers to engage in off-exchange retail commodity transactions involving
leveraged precious metals. Although Oakmont also offered precious metals on a fully-paid
basis, the majority of its business was in off-exchange retail commodity transactions. Only
Oakmontâs off-exchange retail commodity transactions through Hunter Wise during the Relevant
Period are at issue here.

23.  Atall times during the Relevant Period, DiCrisci was an owner, principal, and
controlling person of Oakmont. DiCrisci managed, or controlled those who controlled, the day-
to-day operations of Oakmont; determined employee salaries and commission compensation
rates; directed payments from Hunter Wise to Oakmont;' entered into agreements with Hunter
Wise on behalf of Oakmont; and communicated with Hunter Wise on behalf of Oakmont in
connection with Oakmontâs operations and customer transactions.

24. âAtall times during the Relevant Period, Oakmont employed individuals to,
among other things, solicit retail customers to engage in off-exchange retail commodity

transactions. DiCrisci supervised or managed individuals who oversaw the solicitation of funds

 

' DiCrisci also directed payments due Oakmont from Hunter Wise to another entity he owned and controlled, Joseph
Charles Asset Management, Inc.
Case 9:16-cv-80055-XXXX Document1 Entered on FLSD Docket 01/12/2016 Page 8 of 14

by Oakmont employees, he was involved in hiring Oakmont employees, and he had authority to
fire Oakmont employees.

25. DiCrisci, however, attempted to hide his control over Oakmont. He did not want
his involvement with Oakmont known to regulators and others.

26. | Oakmontâs employees conducted nearly all of their solicitations by telephone.
When soliciting customers for off-exchange retail commodity transactions, Oakmontâs
employees represented that to purchase a certain quantity of metal, customers needed to deposit a
percentage of the total metal value and arrange for a loan for the remaining amount. Hunter
Wise provided the financing for the loans to the customers. However, Oakmont did not disclose
to all of its customers Hunter Wiseâs involvement in the off-exchange retail commodity
transactions.

27. After a customer invested, Oakmont contacted Hunter: Wise to accomplish the
transaction. Oakmont collected the funds needed for the transaction from the customer and sent
them to Hunter Wise. Hunter Wise provided back office support services to Oakmont and
customer access to the details of the transaction.

28. | With respect to retail commodity transactions, Oakmont charged customers
commissions, storage, and other fees for purchasing the metal and interest on loans to buy metal.
Hunter Wise provided Oakmontâs share of the commissions and fees to Oakmont after it
received the customerâs funds from Oakmont.

29. In the leveraged precious metals transactions at issue, Oakmontâs customers did
not take delivery of precious metals.

30. During the Relevant Period, Oakmont collected at least $2,308,228 from at least

107 customers in connection with retail commodity transactions. Of this amount, at least
Case 9:16-cv-80055-XXXX Document1 Entered on FLSD Docket 01/12/2016 Page 9 of 14

$735,329 was paid to Oakmont in the form of commissions, markups, storage fees, and interest
charges.

31. Oakmont and Hunter Wise never bought, sold, loaned, stored, or transferred any
physical metals for the off-exchange retail commodity transactions at issue. Likewise, Oakmont
and Hunter Wise never delivered any precious metals to any customers in connection with the
financed metals transactions at issue.

Vil. VIOLATIONS OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT
COUNT I
ILLEGAL OFF-EXCHANGE TRADING
Violations of 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6(a)

32. Paragraphs 1 through 31 of this Complaint are re-alleged and incorporated herein
by reference.

33. During the Relevant Period, the retail commodity transactions described in this
Complaint were offered and entered into by Defendants (a) on a leveraged or margined basis, or
financed by the offeror, the counterparty, or a person acting in concert with the offeror or
counterparty on a similar basis, (b) with persons who are not ECPs or eligible commercial
entities as defined by the Act, and (c) without being made or conducted on, or subject to, the
rules of any board of trade, exchange, or contract market.

34. The retail commodity transactions described in this Complaint involve
commodities as defined in Section 1a(9) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1a(Q9) (2012).

35. As set forth above, during the Relevant Period, Defendants Oakmont and DiCrisci

violated Section 4(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6(a), by offering to enter into, entering into,

executing, confirming the execution of, or conducting an office or business in the United States

 
Case 9:16-cv-80055-XXXX Document1 Entered on FLSD Docket 01/12/2016 Page 10 of 14

for the purpose of soliciting or accepting orders for, or otherwise dealing in, any transaction in,
or in connection with, retail commodity transactions.

36. Each offer to enter into, execution, confirmation, solicitation, or acceptance of an
order for a retail commodity transaction made during the Relevant Period to a non-ECP customer
is alleged as a separate and distinct violation of Section 4(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6(a).

37. | DiCrisci directly or indirectly controlled Oakmont and did not act in good faith, or
knowingly induced, directly or indirectly, the acts constituting Oakmontâs violations of Section
4(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6(a). Pursuant to Section 13(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13c(b),
DiCrisci is therefore liable for each of Oakmontâs violations of Section 4(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
Â§ 6(a).

38. | The acts and omissions of DiCrisci and other managers, employees, agents, and
other persons acting for Oakmont described in this Complaint were done within the scope of
their employment, agency, or office with Oakmont. Therefore, Oakmont is liable as a principal

' for each act, omission, or failure of DiCrisci and Oakmontâs other managers, employees, agents,
and other persons acting for Oakmont, constituting violations of Section 4(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
Â§ 6(a), pursuant to Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C Â§ 2(a)(1)(B), and Regulation 1.2, 17
C.F.R. Â§ 1.2.

COUNT Il
FAILURE TO REGISTER
Violations of 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6d(a)

39. Paragraphs 1 through 38 of this Complaint are re-alleged and incorporated herein
by reference.

40. During the Relevant Period, Oakmont, through its managers, employees, and

agents, acted as an FCM by soliciting and accepting orders for agreements, contracts, or

10
Case 9:16-cv-80055-XXXX Document1 Entered on FLSD Docket 01/12/2016 Page 11 of 14

transactions described in Section 2(c)(2)(D)(i) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(c)(2)(D)(i) (i.e., retail
commodity transactions), and, in or in connection with those transactions, accepted at least
$2,308,228 from its customers.

41. Section 4d(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6d(a), provides that it shall be unlawful for
any person to be an FCM unless such person shall have registered with the Commission as an
FCM.

42. During the Relevant Period, Oakmont failed to register with the Commission as
an FCM, and therefore violated Section 4d(a), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6d(a).

43. | DiCrisci directly or indirectly controlled Oakmont and did not act in good faith or
knowingly induced, directly or indirectly, the acts constituting Oakmontâs violations of Section
4d(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6d(a), alleged in this Complaint. Pursuant to Section 13(b) of the
Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13c(b), DiCrisci 1s therefore liable for each of Oakmontâs violations of Section
4d(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6d(a).

44. The acts and omissions of DiCrisci and other managers, employees, agents, and
other persons acting for Oakmont described in this Complaint were done within the scope of
their employment, agency, or office with Oakmont. Therefore, Oakmont is liable as a principal
for each act, omission, or failure of DiCrisci and Oakmontâs other managers, employees, agents,
and other persons acting for Oakmont, constituting violations of Section 4d(a) of the Act, 7
U.S.C. Â§ 6d(a), pursuant to Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C Â§ 2(a)(1)(B), and Regulation
1.2,17C.F.R. Â§ 1.2.
