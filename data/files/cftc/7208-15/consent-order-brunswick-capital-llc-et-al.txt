On April 18, 2014, Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ or

U.S.C, Â§Â§ 1 et seq. (2012), and the Commissionâs Regulations (âRegulationsâ) promulgated

THE PARTIES AGREE AND THE COURT HEREBY FINDS:
A. FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Parties

14. Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an independent federal
regulatory agency that is charged by Congress with administering and enforcing the Act, 7
USC. Â§Â§ 1 et seq., and the Regulations promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1.1 et seq.

15. Brunswick Capital LLC is a Connecticut limited liability corporation with its
principal place of business in New Canaan, Connecticut. Weddington became BCLLCâs
managing member and BCLLC served as the CPO for the Pennoyer Fund. BCLLC has never
been registered with the Commission in any capacity.

16. Brunswick Capital Partners LP is a Delaware limited partnership with its principal
place of business in New York, New York. Weddington formed BCLP in 2007. Weddington
became BCLPâs managing partner and president and BCLP served as the advisor to the Pennoyer
Fund. From its inception until October 2011, BCLP was not registered with the Commission.
BCLP became registered with the Commission as a CTA in October 2011 and is currently
registered in that capacity,

17. Wayne Pennoyer Weddington III is a resident of New York, New York.

Weddington is BCLLCâs managing member. Weddington also formed BCLP and is its

SMRH:204222830.1 -5-

 

 
 

managing partner and president. Weddington was not registered with the Commission until
January 2012, Weddington became registered with the Commission as an associated person
(âAPâ) of BCLP and is currently registered in that capacity.

2. Defendantsâ False Exemption and Unregistered CTA Activity

18. Defendants formed the Pennoyer Fund in approximately 2007, and installed
BCLLC as the fundâs CPO and BCLP as the fundâs advisor. Weddington served as BCLLCâs
managing member and BCLPâs general partner and president. Defendants were entitled to
compensation from the Pennoyer Fund in the form of management or incentive fees. BCLP, by
and through Weddington, solicited investments from numerous prospective pool participants.
BCLP, by and through Weddington, also distributed promotional materials containing purported
profits generated from successful commodity trading to the public and prospective pool
participants.

19, Between October and December 2008, the Defendants solicited and accepted
approximately $1.35 million from outside investors for interests in the pool, which ultimately
traded E-mini S&P 500 futures contracts and other e-mini index products offered on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, Inc. (âCMEâ),

20. CPOs and CTAs must electronically file with NFA all notices of exclusion or
exemption from the Commissionâs registration requirements.

21. In October 2008, before commencing trading in the pool, Weddington, on behalf
of BCLLC, filed a notice of exemption under Commission Regulation 4.13(a)(4), 17 C.F.R. Â§
4,13(a)(4), for BCLLC to operate as an exempt CPO.

22. At the same time, Weddington, on behalf of BCLP, filed a notice of exemption
under Commission Regulation 4.14(a)(8) for BCLP to act as an exempt CTA to advise and trade

the Pennoyer Fund without benefit of Commission registration, Commission Regulation

SMRH:204222830.1 -6-

 
 

4.14(a)(8), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 4.14(a)(8), provides that a person is not required to register as a CTA if
(1) the advisor is already registered as an investment adviser under the IAA, registered with a
state securities regulatory agency, or excluded from the definition of an IAA; and, (2) the
commodity trading advice given is solely incidental to the advisorâs business of providing
securities or other investment advice.

23. The notice of exemption Defendants Weddington and BCLP filed for BCLP
under Regulation 4.14 was inaccurate for two reasons, First, neither BCLP nor Weddington was
registered under the IAA during the relevant period, nor were they excluded from the definition
of the term IAA. Second, Defendantsâ commodity trading advice was not solely incidental to
providing securities or other investment advice to the Pennoyer Fund,

24, Defendantsâ filing of an inaccurate notice of exemption was willful. Weddington
and BCLP knew that they were not registered under the IAA because they never sought such
registration, Further, Weddington and BCLP knew that the commodity trading advice BCLP
provided was not merely incidental to the operation of the Pennoyer Fund because Weddington
and BCLP opened and funded the Pennoyer Fundâs futures trading accounts and because the
$1.35 million Defendants traded in E-mini S&P 500 futures contracts from October 2008
through July 2009 made up the overwhelming majority of the funds in the Pennoyer Fund.

25. The exemption claimed by Weddington and BCLP remained inaccurate until
BCLP registered with the Commission as a CTA in October 2011, and Weddington became
registered as an AP of BCLP in January 2012.

26. BCLP acted as a CTA and Weddington acted as an associated person of a CTA
throughout the relevant period by soliciting funds from participants and prospective participants

to trade in E-mini S&P 500 futures contracts in the Pennoyer Fund, and advised others directly

SMRH:204222830.1 -7-

 
 

or indirectly or through publications, writings or electronic media as to the value or the
advisability of trading in commodity futures or options contracts.

3. Defendantsâ Fraudulent Solicitation of Pool Participant Funds and Falsified
Trading Results

27. â By July 2009, the Pennoyer Fund had lost approximately 30% of its value
through, among other things, trading losses. Defendants returned some of the remaining funds to
some of the pool participants.

28. In December 2008, Participant A, a 62 year old resident of Willow, New York,
wired $250,000 to a Pennoyer Fund account that Weddington controlled. By December 31,
2010, due to market losses from Defendantsâ trading, Participant Aâs investment had been
reduced to $190, 837.

29. For several months between January 2010 to December 2010, Defendants issued
or caused to be issued via email to Participant A false monthly statements that misrepresented
the fundâs profits and losses.

30. | Weddington led Participant A to believe that he had the ability to redeem her
funds and led her to believe that her funds were safe and secure by, among other statements,
assuring her in the same e-mail that, in response a specific question she posed, her funds were
not directly exposed to markets and an annual dividend of not less than 4% would be paid to her.
Weddington engaged in this type of communication with Participant A until at least March 2014,
when he sent her an e-mail offering her a promissory note in which he would not return her funds
to her until 2017.

31. Participant A requested return of her funds from Defendants in approximately
July 2012. From that time until at least March 2014, in a series of e-mails and telephone calls,

Weddington repeatedly told Participant A that he would return her funds but never did so.

SMRH:204222830.1 ~8-
 

32. Further, after July 2009, Defendants solicited new fund participants and
prospective participants via email, telephone and other means or instrumentalities of interstate
commerce. In the course of soliciting these new participants and prospective participants,
Defendants made material misrepresentations, omitted material facts and engaged in deceptive
acts and practices in attempts to defraud the participants and prospective participants. For
example, Defendants created false performance and financial records and promotional material
that they used from at least February 2010 to July 2011, in which they falsely claimed that an
algorithmic trading system Weddington had developed called âSysMacroâ to trade E-mini S&P
500 futures contracts made profits nearly every month and over 30% in one year.

33. Additionally, some of the trading Defendants used to create the false performance
records purportedly took place in a hypothetical trading account. Defendants failed to disclose to
new participants or prospective participants that some of the trading results contained in the
performance records were hypothetical and instead presented the results in promotional and
marketing material as actual trading results.

34, Defendants hired marketing managers to assist soliciting the new participants and
prospective participants, and provided the marketing managers with promotional! material
containing false performance records.. Defendants intended that the marketing managers use the
false performance records and false promotional material to solicit prospective participants and
knew or recklessly disregarded that the marketing managers were presenting false and
misleading promotional! material to prospective participants,

35. â_In or about October 2010, Defendants solicited and obtained approximately

$500,000 from a participant to trade in the Pennoyer Fund. Defendants lost at least $30,000 of

the participantâs funds within two to three months. Defendants, knowing these losses occurred,

SMRH:204222830.1 -9-

 
 

continued to claim to prospective participants that their trading of the Pennoyer Fund was
profitable.

36. In or about March 2011, utilizing email, telephone or other instrumentalities of
interstate commerce, Defendants set up and attended meetings with a major financial services
company in attempts to obtain trading funds, Defendants used the false performance records and
undisclosed purported hypothetical trading results to solicit the financial services company.
Further, Defendants falsely inflated the Pennoyer Fundâs assets in a financial prospectus they
provided to the financial services company, claiming that the Pennoyer Fund had between one
and three million dollars in assets under management, when, in fact, the Pennoyer Fund at that
time had approximately $270,000.

37. Inor about August 2011, Defendants, through their marketing managers, solicited
and obtained approximately $1,000,000 from another participant which was sent by bank wire,
an instrumentality of interstate commerce. Shortly thereafter, Defendants had to return the funds
to the participant when the participant learned that Defendants did not have the trading success
represented in their promotional materials.

38. During the relevant period, Weddington at all times controlled and acted on
behalf of BCLLC, BCLP and the Pennoyer Fund. For example, Weddington opened and signed
on behalf of both BCLLC and BCLP all of the account agreements necessary to open and trade
the Pennoyer Fund futures accounts, signed corporate documents assigning BCLLC and BCLP
as the Pennoyer Fundâs operator and advisor. Weddington also created the false Pennoyer Fund
performance records and the false promotional materials, and hired the marketing managers and
armed them with the false promotional materials to solicit participants and prospective

participants.

SMRH:204222830.1 -10-

 
 

39. | Weddingtonâs primary professional activity still involves financial consulting and

acting as a private equity advisor/financing.
B. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1 Jurisdiction and Venue

40, This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 6c(a) of the Act, 7
U.S.C, Â§ 13a-1(a), which provides that whenever it shall appear to the Commission that any
person has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a
violation of the Act or any rule, regulation, or order promulgated thereunder, the Commission
may bring an action in the proper district court of the United States against such person to enjoin
such act or practice, or to enforce compliance with the Act, or any rule, regulation or order
thereunder,

41, Venue properly lies with the Court pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
Â§ 13a-1(e), because Defendants reside and/or maintain an office in this jurisdiction and the acts,
practices in violation of the Act occurred within this District,

2, Defendants BCLP and Weddington Violated Section 9(a)(4) of the Act, 7
U.S.C, Â§13(a)(4), By Seeking An Exemption Based Upon False Information

42, Section 9(a)(4) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§13, in relevant part, makes it unlawful for
any person to willfully make any false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation, or
make or use any false writing or document knowing the same to contain a false, fictitious or
fraudulent statement or entry, to a registered entity, board of trade or futures association
designated or registered under the Act acting in furtherance of its official duties under the Act.

43, As described in paragraphs | 8-25 above, from least October 2008, Defendants
BCLP and Weddington violated Section 9(a)(4) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13(a)(4), by willfully

filing a false notice of CTA exemption with NFA, the registered futures association designated to

SMRH:204222830.1 -11-

 
 

administer Commission registrations. Such exemption was false at the time of filing and
remained false until BCLP became registered with the Commission beginning in October 2011
and Weddington became registered as an AP of BCLP in January 2012.

44, | Weddington controlled BCLP and did not act in good faith or knowingly induced,
directly or indirectly, the acts constituting BCLPâs violations alleged in this count. Pursuant to
Section 13(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13c(b), Weddington is thereby liable for BCLLC and
BCLPâs violations of Section 9(a)(4) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13(a)(4).

45. The foregoing acts, misrepresentations, omissions, and failures of Defendant
Weddington occurred within the scope of his employment with Defendant BCLP. Therefore,
BCLP is liable for these acts in violation of the Act, pursuant to Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7
U.S.C, Â§ 2(a)(1)(B), and Regulation 1.2, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.2.

U.S.C. Â§ 6m(1), By Acting as Unregistered CTAs

47, Section 4m(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6m(1), makes it unlawful for any CTA to
make use of the mails or any means of the instrumentalities of interstate commerce in connection
with its business as a CTA unless registered under the Act.

48, As described in paragraph 26 above, from at least October 2008, BCLP and
Weddington, acting within the scope of his employment with BCLP, made use of the mails or
any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce in connection with BCLPâs business as a
CTA, in that for compensation or profit, they engaged in the business of advising others either
directly or through publications, writings or electronic media, as to the value or the advisability

of trading in any contract of sale of a commodity for future delivery made or to be made on or

SMRH:204222830. 1 ~[2-

 
 

subject to the rules of a contract market or derivatives transaction execution facility, or for
compensation or profit, and as part of a regular business, issued or promulgated analyses or
reports concerning any of the activities referred to above, without benefit of Commission
registration. Defendant BCLP operated as an unregistered CTA in violation of Section 4m(1) of
the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6m(1), until BCLP registered with the Commission in October 2011.

49. | Weddington controlled BCLP and did not act in good faith or knowingly induced,
directly or indirectly, the acts constituting BCLPâs violations alleged in this count. Pursuant to
Section 13(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13c(b), Weddington is thereby liable for BCLPâs violations
of Section 4m(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C, Â§ 6m(1).

50. The foregoing acts, misrepresentations, omissions, and failures of Defendant
Weddington described in this Count occurred within the scope of his employment with
Defendant BCLP. Therefore, BCLP is liable for these acts in violation of the Act, pursuant to
Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C, Â§ 2(a)(1)(B), and Regulation 1.2, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.2,

4, Defendants Defrauded Pool Participants and Attempted to Defraud

Prospective Pool Participants in Violation of Sections 4b(a)(1)(A) and (C) of
the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6b(a)(1)(A) and (C)

unlawful for any person in or in connection with any order to make or the making of any futures
contract to cheat, defraud or willfully deceived, or attempt to cheat, defraud or willfully deceive
any other person by any means whatsoever.

trading and falsely presenting such hypothetical trading as actual trading. Defendants made
these material misrepresentations, omitted these material facts, and misappropriated pool

53. Each material misrepresentation or omission, including but not limited to those
specifically alleged herein, is alleged as a separate and distinct violation of Sections 4b(a)(1)(A)
and (C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6b(a)(1)(A) and (C),

57. As described in paragraphs 28-29 above, from at least January 2010 to the
present, Defendants violated Section 4b(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6b(a)(1)(B), by among
other acts and practices, knowingly or recklessly issuing or causing to be issued to at least one
