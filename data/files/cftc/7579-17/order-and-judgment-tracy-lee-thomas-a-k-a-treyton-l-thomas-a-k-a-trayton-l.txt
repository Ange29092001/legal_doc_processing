ORDER AND JUDGMENT

This matter is before the Court on the Motion for Final Judgement by Default,
Permanent Injunction, Civil Monetary Penalty, and Other Statutory and Equitable Relief
against Defendants. (ECF No. 18.)

On Match 22, 2016, Plaintiff U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCFTCâ)
filed a Complaint charging Defendants Tracy Lee Thomas, a/k/a Treyton L. Thomas, a/k/a
Trayton L. Thomas, a/k/a Trey Thomas, a/k/a Tray Thomas, a/k/a T.L. Thomas
(âThomasâ) and Marbury Advisors Inc. (âMarburyâ) (collectively âDefendantsââ) with
fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions in violation of Section 4b(a)(1)(A)-(C) of the
Commodity Exchange Act, as amended (the âActââ), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6b(a)(1)(A)-(C) (2012).

Defendant Thomas was timely and personally served a copy of the Summons and

Complaint in this action on December 5, 2016, (ECF No. 12), and also via publication in The

Case 1'16-cv-002276-|L_CB-LPA Document 20 Filed 04/11/17 Pane 1of 15
(Charlottesville) Daily Progress and Greensboro News Record with the last date of publication on
October 22, 2016. (ECF Nos. 14, 15). Defendant Marbury was served a copy of the Summons
and Complaint via its designated agent, Interactive Brokers LLC (âInteractiveâ)! on August 1,
2016, and also via its agent Thomas on December 5, 2016. (ECF Nos. 13, 16). Defendantsâ
Answer was due December 27, 2016 and Defendants failed to answer or otherwise plead,
therefore, on January 9, 2017, the Clerk of the Court entered defaults against Defendants
Thomas and Marbury. (ECF No. 17.)

The CFTC has moved this Court to grant final judgement by default against Defendants,
order permanent injunctive relief, and impose a restitution obligation and a civil monetary
penalty.

The Court, having carefully considered the Complaint, the allegations which are well-
pleaded and hereby taken as true, the CFTCâs memorandum in support of its motion for
default judgement, the declarations and exhibits thereto, the record in this case, and the Court
being otherwise advised in the premises,

Accordingly, the Court makes findings of fact, conclusions of law, and enters an Order
of Final Judgment by Default, Permanent Injunction, Civil Monetary Penalties, and Other
Statutory and Equitable Relief (âOrderâ) pursuant to Section 6c and 6d of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§

13a-1 (2012), as set forth herein.

 

"CFTC Regulation 15.05(b) designates the futures commission merchant (âFCMâ) for accounts of
foreign brokers or foreign traders as the agent for service of process. 17 C.F.R. Â§ 15.05(b) (2016).

FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
I. Findings of Fact

A. The Parties

1. U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an independent federal
reeulatory agency charged by Congress with the responsibility for administering and enforcing
the provisions of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1 eÃ© seg., and the Regulations promulgated thereunder,
17 CLELR. QQ 1 et seg.

2. Defendant Tracy Lee Thomas (âUhomasââ) was a resident of Naples, Florida,
during the Relevant Period charged in the Complaint, February 2011 through August 2012
(âRelevant Periodâ). Thomas was the Managing Director of Defendant Marbury. Thomas
has never been registered with the CFTC in any capacity.

3. Defendant Marbury Advisors Inc. (âMarburyâ) was a Cayman Islands

corporation during the Relevant Period and has never been registered with the CFTC in any

 

capacity.
B. Defendantsâ Fraudulent Scheme
4. During the Relevant Period, Defendants engaged in a fraudulent scheme by

soliciting approximately $1,189,000 from customers by misrepresenting that Defendants
would invest in âTreasury Bills on their behalf, misrepresenting Defendantsâ prior investment
and trading success, and misrepresenting that Thomas would manage customer funds in a
conservative manner; and by not disclosing that Defendants used customersâ funds to trade
Chicago Mercantile Exchange (âCMEâ) E-mini S&P 500 futures contracts (âE-miniâ) and

Chicago Board of Trade (ââCBOTââ) 2-Year Treasury Note futures contracts, not disclosing the

Case 1'16-cv-002276-|LCB-LPA Document 20 Filed 04/11/17 Pane 3 of 15
substantial risk of loss associated with commodity futures trading in which all of the
customersâ funds could be lost, and not disclosing the net losses that Defendants sustained
trading commodity futures with customersâ funds.

5. Between 2006 and 2010, Marbury opened several accounts at Interactive, a
registered Futures Commission Merchant (âPCMâ). Thomas maintained trading authority
overt Marburyâs accounts at Interactive. None of Marburyâs accounts at Interactive, including
account ending 0342, were net profitable.

6. In or around March 2009, Defendants obtained control over a trust account at
Fidelity Bank (as trustee) in the name of N.C. & VA. Warranty Inc. (âNCVAâ). NCVA ts a
North Carolina corporation owned by âThomasâ late father, Ronnie Thomas, which sold
automobile warranty policies to car dealerships and was located in Roxboro, North Carolina.
Thomas represented to his late father that Defendants were successful investing in âTreasury
Bills (âT-Billsââ) for other customers using an algorithm designed by Thomas and that
Defendants would invest the money in this trust account to obtain higher returns through safe
(non-risky) investments in â[â-Bills.

7. Beginning in or around April 2010, Thomas solicited Steven Matthews
(âMatthewsâ), to invest in â[â-Bills through Defendants. Matthews owns Matthews Motors
Inc., a car dealership in Clayton, North Carolina, which conducted business with NCVA. In
an email dated February 14, 2011, Thomas represented to Matthews that Thomas would use

>

Matthewsâ funds to conservatively invest in the âT-Bill/Treasury program,â which would
average 4% profitable returns. Thomas also told Matthews that Defendants had been

successful in their prior investments and trading. Between December 2011 and August 2012,

Case 1'16-cv-002276-LCB-LPA Document 20 Filed 04/11/17 Pane 4of15
Matthews made several investments totaling approximately $595,000 with Thomas by wiring
ot providing funds to NCVAâs bank account, which Thomas controlled, and with the
expectation that Defendants would invest in T-Bills.

8. In or around December 2010, Thomas solicited his father-in-law, William Stone
(âStoneââ), to invest in Treasury Bills or âT-Billsâ through Marbury. Thomas falsely
represented to Stone that Defendants were successful in their prior business and trading
activities and the funds would be used to invest in âsafeâ and âconservativeâ T-Bills. Between
February 2011 and August 2011, Stone made several investments with Defendants and wired
a total of approximately $594,000 to the NCVA trust account controlled by Thomas.

9. However, Defendants never invested the customer funds in âTreasury Bills or
T-Bills. Instead, Defendants diverted customer funds by wiring the funds first to Marburyâs
bank account in the Cayman Islands and then to Marburyâs futures trading account ending
0342 at Interactive. Defendants primarily traded 2-year Treasury Note futures and E-mini
futures with these customersâ funds in this account and ultimately lost their funds.

10. Defendants misrepresented to customers that their prior investments and
trading activities were successful, when in fact, Defendants prior investment and trading
activities were net unprofitable.

11. Defendants mispresented to customers that they would use customer funds to
invest âIâ-Bills, when in fact, Defendants intended and did trade on-exchange commodity
futures with the customersâ funds.

12. Defendants never disclosed to these customers that their investments were used

to trade on-exchange commodity futures.

Case 1'16-cv-002276-LCB-LPA Document 20 Filed 04/11/17 Pane 5 of 15
13. During the Relevant Period, Defendants provided Stone and Matthews with
false reports or statements indicating their investments were profitable in Treasury Bills or T-
Bills. These false statements caused Stone and Matthews to make investments throughout the
Relevant Period.

14. Defendants also attempted to conceal their fraudulent conduct from others.
Thomas provided Fidelity Bank, the trustee of the NCVA trust account, with fabricated
Interactive account statements showing investments in Treasury Bills when, in fact, no such
accounts of investments existed. âThomas also falsely represented to Interactive that Marbury
had no U.S. customers when, in fact, Defendants had transferred funds from U.S. resident
customers (Stone and Matthews) to Marburyâs account at Interactive.

15. At all times described herein, Thomas acted knowingly or recklessly when he
made the above-referenced misrepresentations and omissions of material facts..

16. In total, Defendants used approximately $1,189,000 from customers to engage
in commodity futures trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Defendants returned
$78,587 to the defrauded customers. Customersâ net losses proximately caused by Defendants
are $1,110,413. Defendantsâ net gain, therefore, was $1,110,413.

TT. Conclusions of Law

A. Jurisdiction and Venue

17. âThis Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 6c(a) of the Act,
7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1, which provides that whenever it shall appear to the CFTC that any person
has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a violation

of any provision of the Act or the Regulations, the CFTC may bring an action in the proper

Case 1'16-cv-002276-|LCB-LPA Document 20 Filed 04/11/17 Pane 6 of 15
district court of the United States against such person to enjoin such practice, or to enforce
compliance with the Act, or any rule, regulation, or order thereunder.

18. Venue properly lies with this Court pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act, 7
U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(e) (2012), because certain of the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of
business occurred, are occurring, and/or are about to occur in this District, among other
places.

B. Fraud by Misrepresentations and Omissions (Count 1)

19. Sections 4b(a)(1)(A)-(C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6b(a) (1) (A)-(Â©), make it unlawful
for any person, in or in connection with any order to make, or the making of, any contract of
sale of any commodity in interstate commerce or for future delivery that is made, or to be
made, on or subject to the rules of a designated contract market, for or on behalf of any other
person (A) to cheat or defraud or attempt to cheat or defraud the other person; (B) willfully
to make or cause to be made to the other person any false report or statement thereof; or (C)
willfully to decetve or attempt to deceive the other person by any means whatsoever in regard
to any order or contract or the disposition or execution of any order or contract, or in regard
to any act of agency performed, with respect to any order or contract for the other person.

20. By the conduct described in paragraphs 1 through 16 above, Defendants, tn
connection with commodity futures transactions subject to the rules of a designated contract
market and made for or on behalf of other persons, cheated and defrauded or attempted to
cheat and defraud other persons, willfully made or caused to be made to other persons false
reports or statements, and willfully deceived or attempted to deceive other persons by:

a) Misrepresentinge Defendantsâ prior investment and_ trading

Case 1'16-cv-002276-|LCB-LPA Document 20 Filed 04/11/17 Pane 7 of 15
successes which were actually net unprofitable;

b) Misrepresenting that Defendants would manage funds in a

conservative manner by investing in Tâ-Bills when Defendants intended

and did trade on-exchange commodity futures; and

c) Failing to disclose: 1) that Defendants misused customer funds to

trade on-exchange commodity futures, 11) the substantial risks associated

with futures trading, and i) that Defendants lost customer funds

through futures trading;
all in violation of Sections 4b(a)(1)(A)-(C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6b(a)(1)(A)-(C).

21. Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(a)(1)(B) (2012), and CFTC Regulation
1.2, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.2 (2016), provide that the âact, omission, or failure of any official, agent, or
other person acting for any [...] partnership [...] within the scope of his employment or office
shall be deemed the act, omission, or failure of such [...] partnership ....â Strict liability 1s
imposed upon principals for the actions of their agents acting within the scope of their
employment. Because Thomas committed his fraudulent violations while acting as an official,
employee or agent of Marbury acting within the scope of his employment or office, Defendant
Marbury is also liable for âThomasâ violations of the Act pursuant to Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the
Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(a)(1)(B), and Regulation 1.2., 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.2.
22. CFTCâs Motion for Final Judgment by Default, Permanent Injunction, Civil

Monetary Penalties, and Other Statutory and Equitable Relief against each Defendant is
GRANTED, and pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1, Defendants are

26. Defendants shall make Restitution Obligation payments under this Order to the
Monitor in the name "Tracy L. Thomas/Marbury Advisors Fund" and shall send such

discretion to determine the manner of distribution of such funds in an equitable fashion to
the defrauded customers identified by the CFTC or may defer distribution until such time as
the Monitor deems appropriate. In the event that the amount of Restitution Obligation

may, in its discretion, treat such restitution payments as civil monetary penalty payments,
which the Monitor shall forward to the CFTC following the instructions for civil monetary

penalty payments set forth in below.

institution, wherever located, in order to make partial or total payment toward the Restitution
Obligation.

on the date of entry of this Order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1961.
