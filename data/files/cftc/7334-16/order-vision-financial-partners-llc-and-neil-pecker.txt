SEALED ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFFâS EX PARTE MOTION FOR A
STATUTORY INJUNCTION AND RELATED MOTIONS

THIS CAUSE is before the Court upon Plaintiffs Ex Parte Motion for a Statutory

Restraining Order, Preliminary Injunction, and Other Equitable Relief [DE 5] (âMotionâ).

The Court has considered the pleadings, declarations, exhibits, and memorandum in

support, and is otherwise advised in the premises. The Motion will be GRANTED to the

extent that the Court enters a Statutory Injunction granting Plaintiff the relief it requests.

Defendants, Relief Defendants, and other affected persons may move to modify or

vacate the statutory injunction after it has been served. However, this Order will remain

in effect in the meantime.
l. Findings

The Court makes the following findings:

1. This Court has jurisdiction over the parties and over the subject matter of
this action pursuant to 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(e) (2012).

2. Venue lies properly within this District pursuant to 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(e)
(2012).

3. The Commission has presented evidence that, from as early as October,
2012, through the present, Defendants have engaged in a fraudulent scheme to solicit
nearly $3 million from at least 120 members of the public in the United States and
Canada, to trade off-exchange binary options, which are not excepted or exempted from
the Commission's ban on trading options off-exchange. In doing so, Defendants are
making false and misleading sales representations to prospective clients and are failing
to disclose material facts. Defendants have misappropriated almost $2 million of client
funds for their personal use in connection with their scheme by transferring client funds
to Prometheus Enterprises, Inc. (âPrometheusâ), Westward International, Ltd.
(âWestwardâ), Coucarin Holdings Ltd. (âCoucarinâ) and GDCM Trust (collectively, âRelief
Defendantsâ). Relief Defendants are not providing any apparent legitimate services to
clients and do not have any interest or entitlement to client funds.

4. In addition to their fraudulent solicitations, Defendants are impermissibly
receiving client funds in the name of Vision. Further, Vision and Pecker are advising
clients and managing client funds without properly being registered as a commodity
trading advisor (âCTAâ) and an associated person (âAPâ) of a CTA with the Commission,

respectively. Accordingly, the Commission has shown that there is good cause to
believe that Defendants Vision Financial Partners LLC (âVisionâ), by and through the
actions of its sole employee and agent Neil Pecker ("Peckerâ), and Pecker in his
individual capacity (collectively, âDefendantsâ), have engaged, are engaging, and/or are
about to engage in acts and practices constituting violations of Sections 4c(b), 4k(3),
4(m)(1), 401), and 6(c)(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6c(b), 6k(3), 6m(1), 60(1), and 9(1)
(2012), and Commission Regulations (âRegulationsâ) 3.12(a), 4.30, 3.12(a), 32.4(a) and
(c), 17 C.F.R Â§Â§ 3.12(a), 4.30, 32.4(a) & (c), and 180.1(a) (2015).

5. There is good cause to believe that Relief Defendants are receiving funds,
assets, or property as a result of Defendantsâ violative acts and practices and have
been unjustifiably enriched thereby. The Relief Defendants do not have any legitimate
interest or entitlement to these funds, assets, or property received as a result of
Defendantsâ violative conduct.

6. There is good cause to believe that immediate and irreparable damage to
the Court's ability to grant effective final relief for clients in the form of monetary redress
will occur from the sale, transfer, assignment, or other disposition by Defendants and
Relief Defendants of assets or records unless Defendants and Relief Defendants are
immediately enjoined by Order of the Court.

7. There is good cause for the Court to freeze assets owned, controlled,
managed, or held by, on, or for the benefit of Defendants and Relief Defendants.

8. There is good cause for entry of an order prohibiting Defendants, Relief
Defendants, their agents, servants, employees, assigns, attorneys, and persons in
active concert or participation with Defendants and Relief Defendants, including any

successor therefrom, from destroying records and/or denying agents of the Commission
access to inspect and copy records to ensure that Commission representatives have
immediate and complete access to those books and records.

9. Absent the entry of this statutory injunction, Defendant and Relief
Defendants are likely to dissipate or transfer assets and destroy business records.

10. This is a proper case for granting an ex parte statutory injunction to
preserve the status quo, protect public clients from loss and damage, and enable the
Commission to fulfill its statutory duties.
