Case 2:13-cv-00992-MMD-VCF Document171 Filed 02/29/16 Page 8 of 52

a. The Overlapping Businesses

21. Laurent founded Banc de Binary in or about 2010.

22. ETBO owns the trade name Banc de Binary, and has granted licenses to each of
the Corporate Defendants to use that trade name.

23. During the Relevant Period, a website operating under the trade name Banc de
Binary held itself out as being headquartered at 40 Wall Street, New York, New York (the âWall
Street Officeâ), and as having offices at Kristelina Towers, 12 Arch Makariou III, 3" Floor
Office 301, Mesa Yeitonia, Limassol, Cyprus, among other places.

24. Banc de Binary conducts a significant part of their business through its website
located at www.bbinary.com. In addition, Banc de Binary also maintains affiliated websites at
www.bancdebinary.com and www.bbinary.net, among others. Collectively, these websites
comprise the Banc de Binary website (âBanc de Binary websiteâ or âwebsiteââ). Defendants did
not differentiate between the companies on the Banc de Binary website, in Banc de Binary
solicitation materials, or in communications with Banc de Binary customers, including U.S.
customers.

25. Throughout the Relevant Period, ETBO solicited and offered to trade with U.S.
and foreign customers binary options through the Banc de Binary website and through e-mail
and other communications and acted as the counterparty to those transactions. In addition,
ETBO entered into, confirmed the execution of, or maintained a position in, and solicited and
accepted U.S. customer orders and funds offered through the Banc de Binary website, and
through email and other communications, including from U.S. customers, who were not eligible

contract participants (âECPsââ).
Case 2:13-cv-00992-MMD-VCF Document171 Filed 02/29/16 Page 9 of 52

26. During the Relevant Period, BO Systems solicited and offered to trade with U.S.
customers binary options, including U.S. customers that were not ECPs, through the Banc de
Binary website, and through e-mail and other communications and acted as the counterparty to
those transactions. In addition, BO Systems entered into, confirmed the execution of or
maintained a position in, and accepted U.S. customer orders and funds offered through the Banc
de Binary trading website, and through e-mail and other communications, including U.S.
customers that were not ECPs.

27. At least from June 2012 to March 2013,

e BdB Ltd. provided banking and clearing services to BO Systems and
accepted funds from customers, including U.S. customers who were
not ECPs, as BO Systemâs financial agent, for the trading of binary
options;

e BdB Ltd. and BO Systems had access to and used the same binary
options trading platform to accept orders and execute binary option
trades with customers, including U.S. customers; and

e ETBO provided BdB Ltd. and BO Systems marketing and customer
support services in relation to the Banc de Binary trading platform.

28. In or about March 2013, Laurent created BDB Services. At or about the same
time, BO Systems ceased its operations and transferred some or all of its operations to BDB
Services.

29. Since March, 2013:

e BdB Ltd. provided banking and clearing services to BDB Services and
accepted funds from customers, including U.S. customers who were not ECPs,
as BDB Servicesâ financial agent (from March 2013-August 2013), for the
trading of binary options;

e BdB Ltd. and BDB Services had access to and used the same binary options
trading platform to accept orders and execute binary option transactions with
customers, including U.S; and
Case 2:13-cv-00992-MMD-VCF Document 171 Filed 02/29/16 Page 10 of 52

e ETBO provided BDB Services marketing and customer support services in
relation to the Banc de Binary trading platform.

30. The binary options trading platform utilized by the Corporate Defendants to place
orders and execute binary options with U.S. and foreign customers, is the same trading platform
used to place orders and execute binary options through the Banc de Binary website.

b. Common Ownership and Control

31. Laurent owns, manages and controls the Banc de Binary trade name that the
Corporate Defendants use to conduct their binary options business.

32. Laurent is the founder, president, CEO, a director and, along with his father, one
of two equal beneficial owners of BdB Ltd. From its inception to 2012, Laurent was the sole
shareholder of ETBO, and since March 2013, he has been one of three owners of ETBO, the
other two owners being Laurentâs father and his brother. Laurent is and has always been the sole
director of ETBO. He is a signatory on ETBO bank accounts.

33. From its creation and during all relevant times, Laurent was the sole owner of BO
Systems, and a director, officer or agent of the company. He has executed contracts on BO
Systemsâ behalf, including contracts with BdB Ltd. and ETBO. During the Relevant period,
Laurent, along with his father, was one of two equal beneficial owners and a director, officer or
agent of BDB Services. He has executed contracts on BDB Servicesâ behalf, including contracts
with BdB Ltd. and ETBO.

34. Laurent holds himself out both commercially and to regulators as the person
primarily responsible for Banc de Binaryâs business activities. During the Relevant Period he
has been actively involved in the management and general business of each of the Corporate

Defendants.

10
Case 2:13-cv-00992-MMD-VCF Document 171 Filed 02/29/16 Page 11 of 52

35. Laurent speaks on behalf of Banc de Binary to the news media and in numerous
promotional videos on YouTube. He also has been personally involved in responding to certain
customer grievances. Through the videos and other media appearances, Laurent promotes
trading in binary option to U.S. customers and in this way was involved in soliciting U.S.
customers to open accounts with Banc de Binary.

3. The Banc de Binary Website

36. The Banc de Binary website is an internet trading platform through which Banc
de Binary solicits, accepts money from, and executes trades with U.S. customers to trade binary
options. Through the Banc de Binary website, customers buy or sell binary âcallâ or âputâ
options that allow them to predict whether the price of a certain âassetâ will go âupâ or âdownâ
at a future date and/or time.

37. During the Relevant Period, the Banc de Binary website offered for purchase to
U.S. customers with Banc de Binary as the counterparty to the customersâ transactions, binary
options on dozens of âassets,â including commodities (e.g., wheat, oil, gold, platinum, sugar,
coffee, corn, etc.), forex pairs (e.g., EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/JPY, etc.), and stock indices
(e.g., S&P 500, NASDAQ futures, etc.).

38. Once customers opened and funded accounts through the Banc de Binary website,
customers executed trades by selecting a particular asset on the website and predicting if that
assetâs current price will go up or down on a date and time certain. For example, customers who
predicted that the price of oil will rise above the then-current price listed on the website on a
specific future expiration date or time, execute a âCall Optionâ by clicking the âUPâ button on
the website. Conversely, customers who predicted that the price of oil will fall below the then-

current price listed on the website on a specific future expiration date or time, execute a âPut

11
âCase 2:13-cv-00992-MMD-VCF Document 171 Filed 02/29/16 Page 12 of 52.

Optionâ by clicking the âDOWNâ button on the website. The Banc de Binary website permitted
customers to execute trades from between $1 to $8,000, and to pick the date and time of contract
expiration. The Banc de Binary website also lists, by âassetâ or contract, the âPayoutâ or
âreturnâ should the predicted event occur.

39. During the Relevant Period, U.S. customers opened trading accounts on the
website, which they accessed in the U.S., and traded binary options. The options traded
included, but were not limited to, predictions about future price changes of, among other things,
coffee, gold, the US dollar/Japanese Yen forex pair, the Euro/Japanese Yen forex pair, and the
S&P 500 index.

AO. During the Relevant Period, U.S. customers initiated and executed these options
trades on the Banc de Binary website through computer terminals located in the U.S.

41. To fund their Banc de Binary trading accounts and make the trades, U.S.
customers transferred funds from the U.S. to Banc de Binary by credit card, wire transfer, check
or third party payment systems (e.g., MoneyBookers E-wallet, Alertpay E-wallet, etc.) to foreign
bank accounts maintained in the name of Banc de Binary or over which Banc de Binary had
beneficial control and interest.

42. Throughout the Relevant Period, the Corporate Defendants offered to, solicited,
and accepted orders from, and executed trades with U.S. customers who are not ECPs. U.S.
users of the website were not required to submit any information about their net worth, or assets,
or prior trading experience to open a trading account on the website, and the Corporate
Defendants executed trades with U.S. customers, without inquiring into or confirming such

customersâ net worth, assets or prior trading history.

12
Case 2:13-cv-00992-MMD-VCF Document 171 Filed 02/29/16 Page 13 of 52

4. The Bonus Program

43, During the Relevant Period, in addition to the website, the Corporate Defendants
also actively solicited U.S. customers located in the U.S. via telephone, e-mails, and other
communications to participate in Banc de Binaryâs âbonusâ programs.

44. In their solicitations, Corporate Defendants and Banc de Binary claimed they
would provide a certain âdeposit matchâ amounting to a specified percentage of customer funds.
For example, according to the website, if the company âoffers you a 50% deposit match of up to
$50,000, it means that if you open a new real trading account and make a first deposit of $1,200,
Banc [d]e Binary will instantly fund your account with an additional $600 that will go straight to
your trading balance allowing you to trade with $1800 instead of the $1,200 you initially
deposited.ââ The website claims that this bonus âgives you great value and extra trading
leverage.â The âterms and conditionsâ on the website note that, upon accepting the bonus,
customers are prohibited from withdrawing funds from their trading account, including
apparently their own funds initially invested, unless and until the customer trades at least 20
times the value of his or her trading account, or, in the example provided above, $36,000 (i.e.,
$1,200 plus $600 multiplied by 20 = $36,000).

45. Certain of the customers that traded binary options through the website signed up
for the bonus program.

46. The binary options executed by customers as part of the bonus program, including
those executed by U.S. customers, were retail commodity transactions within the meaning of the
CEA because they were leveraged or margined or financed by Banc de Binary and the Corporate

Defendants.

5. The Banc de Binary Businessâs Ongoing Activity

47. On April 9, 2014, the CFTC filed a Motion for Order to Show Cause Why
Defendant [Banc de Binary Ltd.] Should Not be Held in Contempt for Violation of Injunction
(âMotion for Order to Show Causeââ) [DE #48], alleging violations of the Preliminary Injunction
Order due to a transaction with a single U.S. customer. The CFTC subsequently supplemented
its Motion for Order to Show Cause on June 23, 2015 [DE #133], alleging additional transactions
with U.S. customers that violated the Preliminary Injunction Order. Defendants responded to
both the Motion for Order to Show Cause [DE #56] and the Motion to Supplement [DE #141]
and challenged the number of transactions at issue. The CFTC filed replies to each, respectively.
[DE #58, #144. ]

A8. On August 11, 2015, the Court held a hearing on the CFTCâs Motion for Order to
Show Cause and found that Defendant Banc de Binary violated the terms of the Preliminary
Injunction Order. [DE #152].
B. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. Jurisdiction and Venue

49, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(a) (2012) authorizes the Commission to seek injunctive relief
against any person whenever it shall appear to the Commission that such person has engaged, is
engaging, or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a violation of the Act or any
rule, regulation, or order thereunder.

50. The Commission has jurisdiction over the conduct and transactions at issue in this
case pursuant to 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 2(c)(2) & 13a-1 (2012).

51. Venue properly lies with the Court pursuant to 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-I(e) (2012),

because the acts or practices in violation of the CEA and the Regulations have occurred, are

14
Case 2:13-cv-00992-MMD-VCF Document 171 Filed 02/29/16 Page 15 of 52

occurring, or are about to occur within this District, among other places, and because one or
more of the Defendants transact or transacted business in this District.

2. The Corporate Defendants and Banc de Binary Operated as a Common
Enterprise as a Matter of Law

52. ââ[E]ntities constitute a common enterprise when they exhibit either vertical or
horizontal commonality â qualities that may be demonstrated by a showing of strongly
interdependent economic interests or the pooling of assets and revenues.â FTC v. Network
Services Depot, Inc., 617 F.3d 1127, 1142-43 (9"" Cir. 2010). The Ninth Circuit has looked to
the following factors in determining whether companies have acted as a common enterprise: (1)
whether the companies have pooled resources, staff, and funds; (2) whether they have common
ownership and management; and (3) whether they have participated in a âshared business
schemeâ and âcommon revenue.â /d. at 1143; F.T.C. v. Health Formulas, LLC, No. 2:14-CV-
01649-RFB, 2015 WL 2130504, at *6 (D. Nev. May 6, 2015).

53. Under this test, ETBO, BO Systems and BDB Services operated as a common
enterprise during the Relevant Period. BdB Ltd. operated as part of the common enterprise
during at least part of the Relevant Period. Laurent and family members owned and controlled
each corporate entity comprising the Banc de Binary enterprise; the corporate Defendants shared
business addresses; the corporate entitiesâ business activities were interrelated and entwined; and
BdB Ltd. operated as both BO Systemsâ and BDB Servicesâ financial agent, and provided them
banking and clearing services during the Relevant Period.

54. Thus, as a matter of law, BdB Ltd., ETBO, BO Systems and BDB Services

operated as a common enterprise during the Relevant Period.

binary option contracts not excepted or exempted from the Commissionâs ban on trading options
off-exchange, including with U.S. customers that are not ECPs. None of these transactions

63. The acts of the agents and employees of BdB Ltd., ETBO and BO Systems
undertaken on each of their behalves occurred within the scope of their employment. Defendants
BdB Ltd, ETBO and BO Systems are therefore liable for their agentsâ and employeesâ acts,

omissions, or failures pursuant to 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(a)(1)(B) (2012), and 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.2 (2012).

Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (ââDodd-Frankâââ), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1 et seq.
(2012), which, among other things, expanded and clarified the CFTCâs jurisdiction over swaps.
As relevant here, Dodd-Frank defined an option as a swap, with the exception of options subject
to 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 2(c)(2)(C) & 2(c)(2)(D) (2012). Dodd-Frank became effective on July 16, 2011.
66. 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1a(47)G) (2012), defines a âswapâ â unless otherwise excluded under 7

of indebtedness, indices, quantitative measure, or other financial or economic interests or
property of any kind.â
67. On June 26, 2012, Part 32 of the Regulations was repealed and a new Part 32, 17
C.F.R. Part 32 (2013) went into effect. 17 C.F.R. Â§ 32.2 (2013), makes it unlawful for

68. 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(e) (2012) makes it unlawful for
any person, other than an eligible contract participant, to enter into a swap
unless the swap is entered into on, or subject to the rules of, a board of
trade designated as a contract market under section 5.

enter into and entering into binary option transactions with U.S. customers who were not ECPs,
and confirming the execution of those binary options not excepted or exempted from the
Commissionâs ban on trading options off-exchange, including with U.S. customers that are not

70. The Corporate Defendants are not and have never been exempt from the
requirements of 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6c(b) & 2(e) (2012), pursuant to 17 C.F.R. Â§ 32.2 (2013).

71. The acts of the agents and employees of the Corporate Defendants undertaken on
each of their behalves occurred within the scope of their employment. The Corporate
Defendants are therefore liable for their agentsâ and employeesâ acts, omissions, or failures
pursuant to 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(a)(1)(B) (2012) and 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.2 (2013).

72. Laurent is liable under 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13c(b) (2012), as a controlling person of the
Corporate Defendants for their violations of the Act and the Regulations because he controlled,
directly or indirectly, the Corporate Defendants and knowingly induced, directly or indirectly,

the acts constituting the violations.

6(a) (2012), applies to any agreement, contract, or transaction described in 7 U.S.C. Â§
2(c)(2)(D)@) (2012), âas if the agreement, contract, or transactionâ was a futures contract.
75. 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6(a) (2012), as relevant here, makes it unlawful for any person
to offer to enter into, to enter into, to execute, to confirm the
execution of, or to conduct any office or business anywhere in the
United States, its territories, or possessions, for the purpose of
soliciting, or accepting any order for, or otherwise dealing in, any
transaction in, or in connection with, a contract for the purchase or
saleâ a futures contract â(other than a contract which is made on or

Commission as a contract market or derivatives transaction

execution facility for such commodity;

(2) such contract is executed or consummated by or through a

(3) such contract is evidenced by arecord....

76. During the period from July, 2011 through at least March 2013, the Corporate

a contract market or derivatives transaction execution facility and its contracts were not executed
or consummated by or through a contract market; 2) offered to enter into, entered into, confirmed
the execution of, and conducted business in the U.S.; 3) for the purpose of soliciting or accepting

entities (see 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1(a)(17) (2012).

77. The Corporate Defendants are not and have never been exempt from the
requirements of 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6(a) (2012), pursuant to 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6(c) (2012).

78. The acts of the agents and employees of the Corporate Defendants, undertaken on
each of their behalves occurred within the scope of their employment. The Corporate
Defendants are therefore liable for their agentsâ and employeesâ acts, omissions, or failures
pursuant to 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(a)(1)(B) (2012), and 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.2 (2013).

79. Laurent is liable under 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13c(b) (2012), as a controlling person of the
Corporate Defendants, for their violations of the Act and the Regulations because he controlled,
directly or indirectly, the Corporate Defendants and did not act in good faith or knowingly

and 2(c)(2)(B)(iv)()(aa) (2012) and 17 C.F.R Â§ 5.3(a)(4)(i)(B) (2015), and
Laurent Is Liable Under 7 U.S.C. 13c(b) (2012)

80. 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6d(a) (2012), as relevant here, makes it unlawful for âany person to be

21
Case 2:13-cv-00992-MMD-VCF Document 171 Filed 02/29/16 Page 22 of 52

82. 17 C.F.R. Â§ 5.3(a)(4)G)(B) (2015), requires that all FCMs who solicit or accept
orders from any person that is not an ECP in connection with any retail forex transaction must be
registered.

83. During the period from July 16, 2011 through at least March 2013, BdB Ltd.,
ETBO, and BO Systems each operated as an FCM by (i) soliciting and accepting orders for the
purchase or sale of swaps, retail forex transactions, retail commodity transactions, and/or
commodity options, (11) acting as a counterparty to retail commodity options transactions, and
(111) accepting money, securities, or property to margin, guarantee, or secure any trades or

2(c)(2)(B)(iv)(1)(aa) (2012), and 17 C.F.R. Â§ 5.3(a)(4)G@) (2015).

86. The acts of agents and employees of BdB Ltd., ETBO, and BO Systems
undertaken on each of their behalves occurred within the scope of their employment. BdB Ltd.,
ETBO, and BO Systems are therefore liable for their agentsâ and employeesâ acts, omissions, or
failures pursuant to 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(a)(1)(B) (2012) and 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.2 (2013).

87. Laurent is liable under 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13c(b) (2012), as a controlling person of BdB
Ltd., ETBO, and BO Systems for their violations of the Act and the Regulations because he
controlled, directly or indirectly, BdB Ltd., ETBO, and BO Systems and did not act in good faith

V. RESTITUTION, DISGORGEMENT AND CIVIL MONETARY PENALTY
A. RESTITUTION
92. Defendants shall pay, jointly and severally, restitution in the amount of Seven
Million, One Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars ($7,100,000) (âRestitution Obligationâ) payable as
follows:

a. $3.1 million shall be paid to the National Futures Association (âNFAâ), a
self-regulatory organization regulated by the CFTC, upon execution of and in accordance
with this Consent Order and the Judgments and Consents to Final Judgments entered in
the SEC Action against the Defendants; and

b. $4 Million ($4,000,000) is due and owing and is to be paid in separate $1
million increments to the NFA on or before the following dates: February 28, 2016;
September 30, 2016; February 28, 2017; and September 29, 2017, provided, however,

and

24
Case 2:13-cv-00992-MMD-VCF Document 171 Filed 02/29/16 Page 25 of 52

C. In the event that Defendants fail to make any payment toward the
$4,000,000.00 disgorgement amount by the dates and/or in the amounts set forth above in
Paragraph 92(b) on or before the date agreed and/or in the amount agreed according to
the schedule set forth in Paragraph 92(b) above, all outstanding payments and monetary
amounts under this Consent Order, minus any payments made, including post-judgment
interest, shall become immediately due and owing at the discretion of CFTC staff without
further application to or order from the Court. Defendants will deliver proof of payment
through a letter from its counsel, Ifrah PLLC, on firm letterhead indicating the date on
which a wire was sent from Ifrah PLLC's Client Account to the NFA and the wire
confirmation details. Such a letter will be delivered on or before the date of payment, as
specified herein. Receipt of such a letter by the NFA will constitute timely payment. To
the extent Ifrah PLLC is no longer representing Defendants, Defendants acknowledges
and agrees that a payment to the National Futures Association is only deemed received
according to the records of the NFA showing a deposit into the âBanc de Binary â
Restitution Fund. Post-judgment interest shall begin to accrue on the date of the first
failure to make any payment as set forth in Paragraph 92(b) above, and shall accrue and
be applied thereafter to all outstanding monetary amounts.

93. Defendants acknowledge that they, in this action and the SEC Action, have placed
$5,050,000.00 in escrow towards the Restitution Obligation, and agree that these funds will be
released upon entry of this Consent Order and the Judgment entered in the SEC Action, and paid
in accordance with this Consent Order and Judgments and Consents to Final Judgments entered
in the SEC Action.

94. Post-judgment interest shall accrue on the Restitution Obligation on any

25
Case 2:13-cv-00992-MMD-VCF Document 171 Filed 02/29/16 Page 26 of 52

delinquent amounts and shall be determined by using the Treasury Bill rate prevailing on the
date of the delinquency pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1961 (2012).

95. To effect payment of the Restitution Obligation and the distribution of any
restitution payments to Defendantsâ customers the Court appoints the NFA as Monitor
(âMonitorâ). The Defendants shall pay the Restitution Obligation as set forth in Paragraphs 92-
93 above, and the Monitor shall receive restitution payments from Defendants and make
distributions as set forth in Paragraphs 96-101 below. Because the Monitor is acting as an
officer of this Court in performing these services, the NFA shall not be liable for any action or
inaction arising from NFAâs appointment as Monitor, other than actions involving fraud.

96. Defendants shall make Restitution Obligation payments under this Consent Order
to the Monitor in the name âBanc de BinaryâRestitution Fundâ and shall send such Restitution
Obligation payments by electronic funds transfer, or by U.S. postal money order, certified check,
bank cashierâs, or bank money order, to a location specified by the Office of Administration,
National Futures Association, 300 South Riverside Plaza, Suite 1800, Chicago, Illinois 60606
under cover letter that identifies the payment and the name and docket number of this
proceeding. Defendants shall simultaneously transmit copies of the cover letter and the form of
payment to the Chief Financial Officer and the Director, Division of Enforcement, Commodity
Futures Trading Commission, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street, NW, Washington, D.C.
20581.

97. The Monitor shall oversee the Restitution Obligation and shall have the discretion
to determine the manner of distribution of such funds in an equitable fashion to Defendantsâ
customers identified by the CFTC and in the SEC Action in (a list of which is attached hereto as

Exhibit A and incorporated by reference), or may defer distribution until such time as the

26
Case 2:13-cv-00992-MMD-VCF Document 171 Filed 02/29/16 Page 27 of 52

Monitor deems appropriate. In the event the Monitor is unable to distribute all funds contained
in the Banc-de-Binary Restitution Fund to the Defendantsâ customers identified on Exhibit A, the
remaining funds will be transferred to the United States Treasury as civil monetary penalties.

98. Defendants shall cooperate with the Monitor as appropriate to provide such
information as the Monitor deems necessary and appropriate to ensure the accuracy of Exhibit A
and provide contact information to locate Defendantsâ customers identified on Exhibit A.

99. The Monitor shall provide the CFTC and Securities and Exchange Commission
(âSECâ) at the beginning of each calendar year with a report detailing the disbursement of funds
to Defendantsâ customers during the previous year. The Monitor shall transmit this report under
a cover letter that identifies the name and docket number of this proceeding to the Chief
Financial Officer and Director of Enforcement, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Three
Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20581 as well as to John W. Berry,

Washington, DC 20006, jeff @ifrahlaw.com.

100. The amounts payable to each customer shall not limit the ability of any customer
from proving in a separate action that a greater amount is owed from Defendants or any other
person or entity, and nothing herein shall be construed in any way to limit or abridge the rights of
any customer that exist under state or common law.

101. Pursuant to Rule 71 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, each of Defendantsâ
customer who suffered a loss is explicitly made an intended third-party beneficiary of this

Consent Order and may seek to enforce obedience of this Consent Order to obtain satisfaction of

27
Case 2:13-cv-00992-MMD-VCF Document 171 Filed 02/29/16 Page 28 of 52

any portion of the Restitution Obligation that has not been paid by Defendants to ensure
continued compliance with any provision of this Consent Order and to hold Defendants in
contempt for any violations of any provision of this Consent Order.

B. CIVIL MONETARY PENALTY

102. Defendants shall pay, jointly and severally, a civil monetary penalty in the amount
of Two Million U.S. Dollars ($2,000,000) (âCMP Obligationâ), plus post-judgment interest. The
civil monetary penalty is due and owing on or before September 29, 2017, with post-judgment
interest beginning to accrue on that date. Post-judgment interest shall be determined by using the
Treasury Bill rate prevailing on the date of entry of this Consent Order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Â§
1961 (2012).

103. Defendants shall pay their CMP Obligation by electronic funds transfer, U.S.
postal money order, certified check, bank cashierâs check, or bank money order. If payment is to
