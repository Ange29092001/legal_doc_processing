I.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ) has reason to believe that
Respondent Cargill de MÃ©xico S.A. De C.V. (âCargill de MÃ©xicoâ) violated Section 4c(a)(1) of
the Commodity Exchange Act (âthe Actâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6c(a)(1) (2012),' and Commission
Regulation (âRegulationâ) 1.38(a), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.38(a) (2015) Therefore, the Commission deems
it appropriate and in the public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are,
instituted to determine whether Cargill de MÃ©xico engaged in the violations set forth herein and
to determine whether any order imposing remedial sanctions should be issued.

Il.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Cargill de MÃ©xico has
submitted an Offer of Settlement (âOfferâ), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Without admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, Cargill de MÃ©xico
consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 6(c) and 6(d) of
the Act, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (âOrderâ) and acknowledges
service of this Order.â

Il.

 

' Although Section 4c(a)(1)(A) was amended as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act, Pub. L. No. 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376 (2010) (codified as amended in scattered sections of 7, 12, and
15 U.S.C.), that amendment did not affect the operative language for the violations described in this Order.

* Cargill de MÃ©xico consents to the entry of this Order and to the use of these findings in this proceeding and in any
other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party; provided, however, that Cargill
de MÃ©xico does not consent to the use of the Offer, or the findings or conclusions in this Order consented to in the
Offer, as the sole basis for any other proceeding brought by the Commission, other than in a proceeding in
bankruptcy or to enforce the terms of this Order. Nor does Cargill de MÃ©xico consent to the use of the Offer or this
Order, or the findings or conclusions in this Order consented to in the Offer, by any other party in any other
proceeding.
TI.
The Commission finds the following:

A. SUMMARY

On multiple occasions between March 2010 and August 2014 Cargill de MÃ©xico engaged
in wash trades in certain agricultural futures products, including corn, soybeans and wheat, on
the Chicago Board of Trade (âCBOTâ) as well as in hard red wheat traded on the Kansas City
Board of Trade (âKCBTâ), which at the time was a designated contract market. Before orders for
these trades were entered on an exchange, employees of Cargill de MÃ©xico, either acting alone or
with another employee of Cargill de MÃ©xico, entered equal and opposite transactions in the same
futures product for another account that was also owned by Cargill de MÃ©xico, and matched the
product, quantity, price, and timing of those orders and trades. Further, by so structuring or
prearranging and entering these orders, which negated the risk incidental to an open and
competitive marketplace, Cargill de MÃ©xico also engaged in noncompetitive transactions in
violation of Regulation 1.38(a).

B. RESPONDENT

Cargill de MÃ©xico S.A. De C.V. is a Mexican corporation that, among other things,
trades in global futures markets in connection with Cargillâs Mexican agricultural import and
export business in grains and oilseeds. Cargill de MÃ©xico is not registered with the Commission
in any capacity.

Gs FACTS

On multiple occasions between April 2010 and August 2014 Cargill de MÃ©xico entered
into wash trades involving CBOT corn, soybean, and wheat futures contracts and KCBT hard red
wheat futures contracts. Cargill de MÃ©xico traders, acting either alone or with a colleague,
moved futures positions between accounts owned by Cargill de Mexico by entering into equal
and opposite transactions in the same contract, contract month, quantity, and price. They entered
the orders for these trades electronically and timed the order entry to be as close to
simultaneously as possibleâoften entering orders within less than a second.

Cargill de MÃ©xico maintains that it participated in these prearranged trades in order to
move hedging positions for its physical business among numerous accounts. Each account was
used to hedge physical trading conducted by Cargill de MÃ©xico, and each account was linked to a
particular source for the physical product. If the source of the physical product was later
changed because of availability, customer demand, or price, Cargill de MÃ©xico maintains that it
would, as a matter of internal policy, transfer the futures position to the account linked to the
new source of the physical product.

Cargill de MÃ©xico typically effected transfers between accounts by contacting its clearing
broker and effecting transfers pursuant to the policies of the clearing broker and the rules of a
designated contract market. However, in some instances, and in particular near or after the notice

2
date, its clearing broker would not make the back office transfers due to applicable contract
market rules. In these situations Cargill de MÃ©xico traders transferred the positions using the
market but did so in a non-competitive fashion by entering equal and opposite transactions.
Cargill de MÃ©xico entered into numerous such transactions beginning in March 2010 and
continuing into August 2014.

Upon being alerted by CME Group to concerns about its prearranged trading, Cargill de
MÃ©xico instituted a number of changes in its policies and procedures in order to prevent future
violations. Cargill de MÃ©xico has cooperated fully during this investigation.

D. LEGAL DISCUSSION

1. Cargill de MÃ©xico Entered into Wash Sales in Violation of
Section 4c(a)(1)(A) of the Act

Section 4c(a) of the Act makes it âunlawful for any person to offer to enter into, enter
into, or confirm the execution of a transactionâ that is or âis of the character of, or is commonly
known to the trade as, a âwash saleâ ...â 7 U.S.C. Â§6c(a). A wash sale is a form of fictitious sale.
In re Gimbel, [1987-1990 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) J 24,213 at 35,003
(CFTC Apr. 14, 1988).

In order to establish that a wash sale has occurred, it must initially be demonstrated that
the transaction at issue achieved a wash result. The Commission may demonstrate that the trades
resulted in a wash by showing â(1) the purchase and sale (2) of the same delivery month of the
same futures contract (3) at the same (or a similar) price.â Wilson v. CFTC, 322 F.3d 555, 559
(8th Cir. 2003) citing In re Gilchrist, [1990-1992 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) Â§
24,993 at 37,653 (CFTC Jan. 25, 1991); see also In re Citadel Trading, [1986-1987 Transfer
Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep (CCH) Â§ 23,082 at 32,190 (âOrders to purchase and sell for the
account of the same customer the identical quantity of the same futures contract at identical
prices were entered virtually simultaneously.â)

In addition to the factors enumerated in Gilchrist, intent must be proven to establish a
violation of Section 4c of the Act. Reddy v. CFTC, 191 F.3d 109, 119 (2d Cir. 1999), The intent
to negate risk or price competition and avoid a bona fide market position can properly be inferred
from prearrangement but it can also be inferred âfrom the intentional structuring of a transaction
in a manner to achieve the same result as prearrangement.â Jn re Three Eight Corp., [1992-1994
Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) 4 25,749 at 40,444 n.1S5 (CFTC Jun.16, 1993)
(citing In re Collins [1986-1987 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH)22,982 at 31,900-
O01 (CFTC Apr. 4, 1986), rev 'd on other grounds sub nom. Stoller vy. CFTC, 834 F.2d 262 (2d
Cir. 1987) (âCollinsââ)), The placement of offsetting orders to buy and sell, while simultaneously
taking steps to âenhance the likelihood that the buy and sell orders would be filled at the same or
a similar priceâ is persuasive evidence that the trader intends to negate risk and price
competition. Collins at J 31,900; see also In re Piasio, [1999-2000 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut.
L. Rep. (CCH) Â§ 28,276 at 50,685, 50,689-691 (CFTC Sep. 29, 2000) (finding customer who
placed paired buy and sell orders, with specific pricing and loss limitation instructions,
âstructured orders to negate riskâ and thus had intent to violate Section 4c), aff'd sub nom.
Piasio v. CFTC, [2002-2003 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) Â§ 29,251 (2d Cir.
Dec. 31, 2002).

The Cargill de MÃ©xico traders entered into trades for the purchase and sale in the same
delivery month of the same futures contract at the same prices, and thus achieved wash results.
Additionally, the Cargill de MÃ©xico traders knowingly entered into the purchase and sale of the
same delivery month of the same futures contracts at the same (or a similar) price for the
purpose of transferring positions between Cargill de MÃ©xico accounts. In doing so, Cargill de
MÃ©xico violated Section 4c(a)(2)(A) of the Act by entering into transactions of the character of
and commonly known as wash sales.

2. Cargill de MÃ©xico Executed Noncompetitive Trades in Violation of
Commission Regulation 1.38(a)

Regulation 1.38(a) requires that all purchases and sales of commodity futures be executed
âopenly and competitively.â The purpose of this requirement is to ensure that all trades are
executed at competitive prices and that all trades are directed into a centralized marketplace to
participate in the competitive determination of the price of futures contracts. Noncompetitive
trades are generally transacted in accordance with express or implied agreements or
understandings between and among the traders. See, e.g., In re Gilchrist, [1990-1992 Transfer
Binder] Comm, Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) Â§ 24,993 at 37,652 (CFTC Jan. 25, 1991). Noncompetitive
trades are also a type of fictitious sale because they negate the risk incidental to an open and
competitive market. Jn re Fisher, Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) at 56,052 n.11. Prearranged
trading is a form of anti-competitive trading that violates Regulation 1.38(a). Jn re Shell US
Trading Co., [2005-2007 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) Â§ 30,161 at 57,632
(CFTC Jan. 4, 2006); In re Gimbel, [1987-1990 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH)
4 24,213 at 35,003 (CFTC Apr. 14, 1988), aff'd as to liability, 872 F.2d 196 (7th Cir. 1989).

By knowingly structuring and entering into prearranged noncompetitive trades, Cargill de
MÃ©xico violated Commission Regulation 1.38(a).
