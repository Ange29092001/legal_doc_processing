Plaintiff, Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ or âCFTCâ), an
independent federal agency, by and through its attorneys, alleges as follows:

I SUMMARY

1. From at least August 2016 through October 2017 (the âRelevant Periodâ), Mayco
Alexis Maldonado Garcia (âMaldonadoâ), Cesar Castaneda (âCesar Castanedaâ), Joel Castaneda
Garcia (âJoel Castanedaâ), and Rodrigo Jose Castro Molina (âCastroââ), jointly d/b/a Global
Trading Club (collectively, âDefendantsââ), operated a fraudulent scheme involving the
solicitation of customer funds which were to be used to speculate in price movements of Bitcoin,
a digital asset. Specifically, Defendants and others falsely represented to actual and potential
customers that their business, named Global Trading Club (âGTCâ), employed âmaster tradersâ
who had years of experience trading âcrypto currency,â and used âcutting edge trading robotsâ to
trade Bitcoin for customers â24 hours a day, 7 days a week.â Defendants further falsely

represented that customer earnings would increase based on the amount of their deposit, and that

rane,

GTC would award bonuses to customers who referred others to GTC, in the form of a multi-level
marketing scheme.

2. At least 27 individual customers deposited at least $989,000 with one or more
representatives of GTC.

3. To conceal their fraud, Defendants caused misleading trading statements to be
posted online. GTC customers could access the online statements by logeimg into an Internet
web site and/or a smartphone app. These misicading trading statements did not accurately reflect
the Bitcom trading purportedly undertaken by Defendants and led certam customers to beheve
they were earning significant amounts of money from Defendantsâ trading of Bitcoin on their
behalf.

4. At various times during the Relevant Period, at least some customers
unsuccesstully attempted to withdraw funds from their accounts. One or more Defendants
responded with purported explanations regarding why the money could not be withdrawn,
including that the web site and/or smartphone app were experiencing technical problems.
Eventually, Defendants stopped responding to customers, some of whom lost the full amount of
the funds they deposited with Defendants for trading.

5. By this conduct and the conduct further described herein, Defendants engaged,
are engaging, and/or are about to engage in fraudulent acts and practices in violation of Section
6(c)(1) of the Commeadity Exchange Act Actâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 9C1) 2018), and Commission
Regulation ( Regulationâ) 180. (a), P7 CPLR. Â§ 180.1 (2019).

6. Accordingly, pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ I3a-1 (2018), the
Commission brings this action to enjom Defendantsâ unlawful acts and practices, to compel their

comphance with the Act and Regulations, and to further enjoin Defendants from engaging in any

commodity interest-related activity. In addition, the Commission seeks civil monetary penalties,
restitution, and ancillary remedial relief, including, but not limited to, trading and registration
bans, rescission, disgorgement of benefits derived from Defendantsâ illegal activities, fees and
costs, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, and such other equitable relief as the Court may
deem necessary and appropriate.

IV. STATUTORY BACKGROUND

14. Digital assets such as Bitcoin are encompassed in the definition of âcommodityâ
under Section la(9) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ la(Q) (2018). For the purposes of this Complaint, a
digital asset, also known as âvirtual currencyâ or âcryptocurrencyâ, means a digital
representation of value that functions as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and/or a store
of value. Digital assets are distinct from ârealâ currencies, which are the coin and paper money
of the United States or another country that are designated as legal tender, circulate, and are
customarily used and accepted as a medium of exchange in the country of issuance. Digital
assets typically use cryptographic protocols to secure transactions in that asset and use
decentralized networks to track transactions between persons who are denominated only by

publicly visible strings of characters. The transactions are captured in single blocks at a time,

4
Case 4:20-cv-03185 Document1 Filed on 09/11/20 in TXSD Page 5 of 13

which independent operators (called âminers,â a virtual analogy to actual miners whose efforts
unearth gold, silver, and other precious metals) confirm by performing algorithmic proofs of
work and for which they are usually awarded a sum of the virtual currency in question. The
public nature of the decentralized ledger allows people to recognize the transfer of digital assets
from one user to another without requiring any central intermediary in which both users need to
trust.

V. FACTS
A. Defendants Solicited Customers to Purchase Bitcoin with GTC

15. In 2016, Defendants began to market a new business called GTC. The stated
purpose of GTC was to offer customers an opportunity to profit from speculative trading that
was based upon price fluctuations in Bitcoin.

16. Although Defendants marketed Bitcoin trading using the GTC name, GTC did not
exist as a separate legal entity. Instead, Defendants Maldonado, Cesar Castaneda, and Joel
Castaneda used separate corporate entities, and opened bank accounts in the names of those
entities, through which they accepted deposits from GTC customers.

17. During the Relevant Period, Defendants continued to promote the GTC business

using numerous channels, including a web site, www.gtcexchange.com (âGTC web siteâââ); a

 

smartphone app called âGTC Digitalâ; videos posted to a YouTube channel; and a Facebook
page called Global Trading Club. The GTC web site and Facebook page presented Castro as a
key leader in the company. On the GTC web site, Castro was listed a member of GTCâs âMaster
Council Leadershipâ; on the GTC Facebook page and Castroâs personal Facebook page, Castro
was called a âFinancial Advisor Bitcoinâ and a âMaster Councilâ for GTC.

18. Additionally, throughout the Relevant Period, Defendants made representations

directly to actual and potential customers during GTC âcryptocurrencyâ seminars held by

5
Case 4:20-cv-03185 Document1 Filed on 09/11/20 in TXSD Page 6 of 13

Defendants in Houston and elsewhere in the United States. During these seminars, Defendants

shared a GTC marketing presentation, which contained the same representations found on the

GTC web site and in the YouTube videos.

19.

following:

20.

The GTC seminars conducted by one or more of the Defendants included the

In September 2016, Maldonado spoke to members of a Korean-American
church at a luncheon in Santa Maria, California;

In September 2016 and February 2017, Maldonado spoke to potential
customers at a seminar held in Hawaii;

In September 2016, Castro and Maldonado spoke with potential customers in
Los Angeles, and Castro spoke with potential customers in Las Vegas. Castro
advertised these seminars in Spanish-language posts on Facebook;

In September 2016, Castro, Cesar Castaneda, Joel Castaneda, and Maldonado
hosted a seminar at Drury Inn and Suites in Houston. Castro advertised the
seminar in a Spanish-language post on Facebook.

In November 2016, Castro spoke with potential customers in Miami. He
advertised this seminar in a Spanish-language post on Facebook, as well as a
Spanish-language multilevel marketing web site, www.universomlm.com, in
which Castro is referenced as a âsocio fundadorâ (translated as âfounding
memberâ) and âMaster Internacionalâ (translated as âInternational Masterâ) of
GTC. Castro also purported to achieve âun explosivo crecimiento en apenas
dos mesesâ (translated as âexplosive growth in two short monthsâ) for GTC;
and

 

In December 2016, Defendants hosted a GTC holiday party for potential
customers at a hotel in Houston. Maldonado, Cesar Castaneda, Joel
Castaneda, and Rodrigo Castro attended.

Throughout the Relevant Period, Maldonado also held one-on-one and small-

group meetings with potential customers. Some of these meetings took place at a business office

located in an apartment complex in Houston. During these meetings, Maldonado shared the

GTC marketing presentation with customers.

21. Defendants marketed the GTC business to non-Enghish-speaking residents of the
United States. The GTC web site highlighted Korean- and Spanish-speaking representatives of
the business. Maldonado circulated Spanish and Korean translations of the GTC marketing
presentation to the other Defendants, as well as other individuals who marketed the GTC
business on behalf of Defendants. The YouTube videos were also translated into Spanish,
Korean, and other languages.

B. Defendants Made False and Misleading Representations when Soliciting
GTC Customers

22. The GTC web site, YouTube videos, marketing presentations, and/or other GTC
marketing matenals included the following representations:
e@ GTC employed âover 75 master tradersâ
Â® These traders had years of trading experience m âcrypto currencyâ trading;
Â® GTC customer âcapital is continuously being traded in a real time
environment, by our expert traders and cutting edge trading robots 24 hours a
day, 7 days a week.â

Â® âWith our automated trading software and monitoring system, trades are done
automatic [sic] for members with no risk. Finally the best way to trade with

+ 99

no experience. âPut your hitcoin to work for youâ.â (emphasis in original)

23. The GYC marketing materials further represented that customers could join one of
multiple GTC membership levels, ranging from $250 CEntrepreneurâ level to $31,000
(âFounder Traderâ level). The GPC marketing materials set forth guaranteed specific daily
earnings, which would merease based on the customer's membership level at GTC,

24. The GTC marketing materials offered further earnings through its multi-level
marketing structure, under which customers could earn additional money by referring new
customers to GTC. Customers were promised a cash bonus for each direct referral, in the

amount of 20 percent of the deposit made by the referred customer. Customers were further

offered bonuses for indirect referrals and a âbimary matching bonusâ tor multi-level marketing
âteams.â The amount of the bonuses increased if customers made additional deposits with GTC,
which placed them at a higher membership level within GTC,

25. Defendants made representations similar to those set forth in Paragraphs 22-24
during the GTC seminars, meetings with small groups of customers, and/or individual customer
meetings described in paragraphs 15-21.

26. The representations set forth in Paragraphs 22-24 are false. Upon information and
behef, Defendants employed no traders, and neither created nor used any trading robots.
Accordingly, GTC customer capital was not âbeing traded in a real tume environment, by our
expert traders and cutting edge trading robots 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.â Additionally, one
or more GTC customers did not receive any daily earnings or referral bonuses.

27, Defendants concealed their fraudulent conduct by causing misleading trading
statements to be posted online. GTC customers could access the online statements by logging
into a web site and/or the GTC Digital app, using a username and password. Once flogged in,
customers could see how much money they'd earned from GTC's purported trading on their
behalf. Opon information and belief, these misleading trading staternents did not accurately
reflect the Bitcom trading purportedly undertaken by Defendants and led at least certain

customers to believe they were earning significant profits from their Bitcomm trading.
