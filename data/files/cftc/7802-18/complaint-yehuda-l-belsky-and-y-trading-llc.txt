COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF,
RESTITUTION, AND CIVIL MONETARY PENALTIES
UNDER THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT

Plaintiff, Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ or âCFTCâ), by its

attorneys, alleges as follows:
I. SUMMARY

1. Since at least June 22, 2015, through the present (the âRelevant Periodâ),
Defendant L. Yehuda Belsky (âBelskyâ) a.k.a. Jay Bell, acting individually and on behalf of
Defendant Y Trading, LLC (âY Trading,â and together with Belsky, âDefendantsâ), has engaged
in a fraudulent scheme to solicit at least $1,258,000 from at least fourteen customers to trade
binary options on the North American Derivatives Exchange, Inc. (âNadexâ) in violation of the
Commodity Exchange Act (âActâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1-27f (2012), and the regulations promulgated
thereunder (âRegulationsâ), 17 C.F.R. pts. 1-190 (2017).

2. In solicitations of customers Belsky, acting both as an individual and at times
through Y Trading, made false and misleading claims including, but not limited to, that he: (1)
was an expert binary options trader; (2) had a record of profitable binary options trading; and (3)

was successfully trading binary options on behalf of multiple customers at the time.
3. Belsky solicited funds from prospective customers in order to conduct two
distinct fraudulent schemes. With regard to the first scheme, Belsky induced some customers to
send Defendants at least $719,000 to trade binary options on their behalf. With regard to the
second scheme, Belsky induced customers into authorizing him to trade at least $539,000 of
customer funds in the customersâ Nadex binary options trading accounts.

4. Belsky omitted material facts in his solicitations including, but not limited to, that
he: (1) was misappropriating customer funds; (2) had no binary options trading account in the
name of Y Trading or in his own name from which to trade binary options; and (3) along with a
company Belsky previously owned, Innovative Capital Management, LLC (âInnovativeâ), had
been the subject of a December 19, 2008 Commission Order (â2008 Orderâ) finding that Belsky
and Innovative had committed a $1,250,000 fraud and lied to the National Futures Association
(âNFAâ), a registered futures association, during a routine audit.

5. By surreptitiously trading binary options on Nadex, an online binary options
exchange that is registered with the Commission as a Designated Contract Market (âDCMâ) and
a Derivatives Clearing Organization (âDCOâ), using some of his customersâ credentials, Belsky
violated the 2008 Order.

6. On February 21, 2018, during investigative testimony under oath before the
Commission, Belsky made false or misleading statements of material facts, or omitted to state in
any such statements material facts that were necessary to make any statements of material fact
made not misleading in any material respect, while he knew, or reasonably should have known,
the statements he made to be false or misleading.

7. By virtue of this conduct and conduct further described herein, Belsky, either

directly or as a controlling person, has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in acts and
Case 1:18-cv-05408 Document1 Filed 09/26/18 Page 3 of 24 PagelD #: 3

practices in violation of the Act and Regulations, specifically Sections 4m(1), 40(1)(A) and (B),
6(c)(2), and 6c(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6m(1), 60(1)(A), (B), 9(2), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(a) (2012),
and Defendants have engaged, are engaging, or are about to engage in acts and practices in
violation of the Act and Regulations, specifically Section 4c(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6c(b)
(2012), and Regulation 32.4(a) and (c), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 32.4(a), (c) (2017).

8. Accordingly, pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2012), the
Commission brings this action to enjoin such acts and practices and compel compliance with the
Act and Regulations. In addition, the Commission seeks civil monetary penalties and remedial
ancillary relief including, but not limited to, trading and registration bans, restitution,
disgorgement, post-judgment interest, and such other relief as the Court may deem necessary and
appropriate.

9. Unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, Defendants are likely to continue to
engage in the acts and practices alleged in this Complaint and similar acts and practices, as more
fully described below.

II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

10. Jurisdiction. This Court possesses jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28
U.S.C. Â§ 1331 (2012) (codifying federal question jurisdiction) and 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1345 (2012)
(providing that U.S. district courts have original jurisdiction over civil actions commenced by the
United States or by any agency expressly authorized to sue by Act of Congress). In addition,
Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2012), provides that United States district courts possess
jurisdiction to hear actions brought by the Commission for injunctive relief or to enforce
compliance with the Act whenever it shall appear to the Commission that such person has

engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a violation of any
Case 1:18-cv-05408 Document1 Filed 09/26/18 Page 4 of 24 PagelD #: 4

provision of the Act or any rule, regulation, or order thereunder. The offered binary options at
issue in this action constitute âoptionsâ pursuant to Section 4c(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6c(b)
(2012), because the assets underlying them were âcommoditiesâ pursuant to Section 1a(9) or
1(a)(19) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1a(9), (19) (2012).

11. Venue. Venue properly lies with the Court pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act, 7
U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(e) (2012), because Defendants transacted business in this District, and acts and
practices in violation of the Act and Regulations occurred, are occurring, or are about to occur
within this District.

Hl. THE PARTIES

12. Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an independent federal
regulatory agency charged by Congress with the administration and enforcement of the Act and
Regulations.

13. Defendant Yehuda L. Belsky is an individual residing in Brooklyn, New York.
Belsky conducted business individually and as the sole owner and operator of Y Trading. Belsky
and Innovative were the subjects of the 2008 Order, which found that they had engaged in
fraudulent solicitation and misappropriation of customer funds in violation of Sections
A4b(a)(2)(i), (i), and (iii) and 40(1)(A) and (B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6b(a)(2)G), (ai), (it),
60(1)(A), (B) (2006), and made false statements to NFA in violation of Section 9(a)(4) of the
Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13(a)(4) (2006). The 2008 Order permanently prohibited Belsky from, among
other things, trading on or subject to the rules of any registered entity, including any DCM, and
ordered him to cease and desist from violating Section 40(1)(A) and (B) of the Act. Between
2002 and 2008 Belsky was registered with the Commission as an associated person (âAPâ), and

listed with NFA as principal, of Innovative.
Case 1:18-cv-05408 Document1 Filed 09/26/18 Page 5 of 24 PagelD #: 5

14. Defendant Y Trading, LLC is a New York limited liability company formed in
February 2011. Until approximately December 2016, the firm conducted business at 40 Wall
Street, fifth floor, New York, New York. Upon information and belief Belsky, the sole owner of
Y Trading, operated the firm in an informal manner without keeping regular business records. Y
Trading, through Belsky, solicits customer funds for the purported purpose of investing in binary

options. Y Trading has never been registered with the Commission in any capacity.

IV. FACTS
A. Binary Options
15. A binary option is a type of options contract in which the payout depends entirely

on the outcome of a yes/no proposition, typically relating to whether the price of a particular
asset that underlies the binary option will rise above or fall below a specified amount. Unlike
other types of options, a binary option does not give the holder the right to purchase or sell the
underlying asset. When the binary option expires, the option holder will receive either a pre-
determined amount of cash or nothing at all.

16. â Binary options are âoptions,â as defined by Section 1a(36) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
Â§ 1a(36) (2012), and binary options on commodity futures and âcommodities,â as defined by
Section la(9) or (19) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1laQ), (19) (2012), are commodity option
transactions pursuant to Section 4c(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 4c(b) (2012), and Regulation 32.2,
17 C.F.R. Â§ 32.2 (2017).
B. Defendantsâ Fraudulent Solicitations and Omissions

17. During the Relevant Period, Belsky, operating individually and at other times as
Y Trading, induced customers to provide him with funds by touting his reputation as an expert

binary options trader and offered finderâs fees to individuals who introduced customers to him.

ne a

18. Based on his purported binary options trading skills, Belsky provided paying
customers with contracts that were six months in duration (âY Trading Agreementsâ). Belsky
promised to pay some of his customers a fixed ten percent (10%) per month return, which
equates to a one-hundred and twenty percent (120%) annual rate of return. Belsky promised
other customers an unspecific share of the trading profits from his binary options trading.

19. Despite using his customersâ funds for binary options trading, which was
prohibited by the 2008 Order, Belsky attempted to conceal the fact that he was doing so by
omitting any reference to binary options trading in the Y Trading Agreements. Instead, each Y
Trading Agreement was captioned as an âAgreement/Noteâ and characterized the funds the
customers provided to Belsky as six-month loans. Verbally, however, Belsky told these same
customers that the their funds would be used to trade binary options and that the high rate of
return he offered was as a result of his ability to engage in profitable binary options trading.

20. Belsky supported his assertion that he was a successful binary options trader with
false and misleading statements, including claiming that he had developed a trading method for
binary options trading that produced consistent profits on behalf of multiple clients. In fact, his
actual binary options trading had resulted in significant losses.

21. From May 2017 to September 2017, Belsky also marketed himself and Y Trading
through paid online social media and press releases. Through at least thirteen online press
releases he sought to bolster his image as a binary options authority and to ârehabilitateâ his
name by obscuring the 2008 Order. Belskyâs series of Newswire.com press releases echoed the
sales pitch he made directly to customers and included the following claims:

a. âBelsky is a highly respected financial expert and traderâ;

b. âa world-renowned financial expert who has traded on
various markets the world overâ;
C. âhis greatest expertise is on binary options, and he has
developed a method to make binary options trading more
likely to be successfulâ; and

d. âhonesty is another quality that sets him apart from other
financial experts and traders.â

22. When soliciting some of his customers for the purpose of trading binary options,
Belsky presented himself under the false identity âJay Bell,â and drafted and signed agreements
with customers who provided him with funds as âJay Bell.â âJay Bellâ was neither Belskyâs
given name nor any legal name associated with his true name. On other occasions, Belsky also
conducted business using his true name.

23. By presenting himself to some customers as âJay Bell,â Belsky prevented them
from conducting due diligence research that would have revealed his history of fraudulent
financial activity and false statements found in the publicly-available 2008 Order that is
connected with Belskyâs true name and not with his false identity âJay Bell.â

24. When soliciting customers, Belsky assured them that his established and
successful binary options trading methods had historically produced a high level of profits.

25. Upon information and belief, all of the representations Belsky made about his
trading expertise and ability to generate profits for customers by trading binary options were
knowingly false when made.

26. On February 28, 2017, Belsky provided one group of potential customers with a
fabricated binary options trading account statement in the name of Y Trading, including with the
Nadex name and logo, in order to bolster his false claims of conducting profitable binary options
trading in his own or Y Tradingâs account. Other customers relied on his verbal claims of
purported trading expertise and past profits.

27. This fictional Y Trading Nadex account statement that Belsky used to mislead his

prospective customers listed supposedly profitable binary options trades based on CME E-mini

7
Case 1:18-cv-05408 Document1 Filed 09/26/18 Page 8 of 24 PagelD #: 8

Nasdag 100Â® Index Futures and CME E-mini S&P 500Â® Index futures purportedly made by
Belsky.

28. Belsky did not place any of the customer funds he collected in a Y Trading
binary options trading account, contrary to the misleading statements he made to some of his
customers when he induced them to provide funds for his binary options trading. In fact, neither
Belsky nor Y Trading maintained any binary options trading accounts in either of their names.

29. Belsky did not inform any of his customers that he was the subject of the 2008
Order in which the Commission determined that Belsky and his prior company, Innovative, had
committed fraud and lied to NFA during a routine audit.

OF Defendantsâ Collection of, and Failure To Repay, Customer Funds

30. During the Relevant Period, Defendants acquired and controlled customer funds
in two ways. For some customers, generally those who provided relatively smaller amounts of
funds, Belsky requested or required that they provide funds to him in cash. For customers who
provided relatively larger amounts of funds Defendants directed them to send funds to a bank
account in the name of Y Trading.

31. During the Relevant Period, Defendants received at least $719,000 in the Y
Trading bank account from at least eleven customers.

32. Once Defendants obtained funds from their customers, they either failed to pay
the promised ten percent per month return or stopped making such payments after a short period
of time. When customers demanded the return of their funds, Belsky sometimes made token
payments and occasionally repaid customers who had provided Defendants with a relatively

small amount of funds with other customer funds in a manner akin to a Ponzi scheme.
Case 1:18-cv-05408 Document1 Filed 09/26/18 Page 9 of 24 PagelD #: 9

33. In March 2017, several customers learned of Belskyâs fraudulent trading history
and demanded the return of their funds. In or about July 2017, Belsky responded to their
requests by falsely informing them that he could not return their funds because they had been
frozen by the Commission.

D. Belskyâs Rejected Nadex Application and Surreptitious Trading Using Customer
Credentials

34. On or about May 13, 2015, Belsky applied for membership at, and sought to open
a binary options trading account with, Nadex. On May 19, 2015, Nadexâs compliance personnel
informed Belsky via email that it had denied his application for membership.

35. On May 20, 2015, Belsky emailed a petition appealing the denial of his
membership application to Nadex, arguing in part that binary options are different than
commodity futures and therefore he should be granted membership with Nadex, notwithstanding
the permanent ban language contained within the 2008 Order.

36. Via letter dated June 15, 2015, Nadexâs Chief Executive Officer (âCEOâ)
responded to Belsky by notifying him that he had denied Belskyâs appeal of Nadexâs compliance
departmentâs decision to deny his application for Nadex membership. Nadexâs CEO also
specifically explained to Belsky that, because Nadex is a âregistered entityâ under the Act, the
2008 Order prohibited him from trading directly or indirectly on Nadex, stating in relevant part:

As you are likely aware, Nadex is a Derivatives Clearing
Organization (âDCOâ) and Designated Contract Market (âDCMâ),
registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
(âCFTCâ). The definition of âregistered entityâ as set forth in the
Commodity Exchange Act (now codified in Section 1a(40), as
revised by the Dodd-Frank Act), includes both âa board of trade
designated as a contract marketâ and âa derivatives clearing
organizationâ registered in accordance with sections 7 and 7a-1 of
Title 7 of the United States Code. As a registered DCM and DCO,

Nadex falls under the definition of âregistered entity.â As noted
above, you are permanently prohibited from trading on any
s
Ds awe
RN %

SOLAS EERIE GL LF

registered entity, either directly or indirectly. It is therefore clear
that based upon the order imposed by the CFTC (to which you
agreed) you are prohibited from trading on Nadex.

37. Starting on or about a week after Nadexâs CEO affirmed Nadexâs denial of his
membership application, Belsky requested or required at least three customers to open and fund
binary options trading accounts at Nadex and provide him with their login credentials.

38. Customers deposited at least $539,000 into their own Nadex accounts at Belskyâs
direction. Belsky then surreptitiously commenced trading the personal funds of these customersâ
Nadex accounts in violation of the 2008 Order, which permanently prohibited Belsky from
directly or indirectly trading on or subject to the rules of any registered entities.

39. As an example, on or about June 22, 2015, Belsky induced Customer A to open
an account at Nadex and then to provide Belsky with Customer Aâs login credentials. Belsky
used Customer Aâs login credentials to conduct trades in Customer Aâs binary options trading
account from June 2015 through June 2016 without Nadexâs knowledge. Throughout this time,
Belsky informed Customer A that he was trading in Customer Aâs Nadex account.

AO. During the aforementioned twelve-month period, Customer A deposited $14,000
into his Nadex binary options trading account, and Belsky lost approximately $13,000 of this
amount through trading binary options in Customer Aâs Nadex binary options trading account.

41. In or about January 2016, Belsky made an arrangement with another customer,
Customer B. Customer B entered into a âManaged Account Agreementâ with Defendants and
deposited a total of $500,000 into his binary options trading account at Nadex during January
and February 2016. Starting on or about February 1, 2016, Belsky conducted binary options

trading in Customer Bâs binary options trading account without Nadexâs knowledge.

10
Throughout this time, Belsky informed Customer B that he was trading Customer Bâs Nadex
account.

42. In less than two months Belsky lost approximately $200,000 trading binary
options in Customer Bâs Nadex binary options trading account.

43. Belsky traded various binary options in Customer A and Customer Bâs accounts,
including, but not limited to, the âUS 500,â which is based on CME E-mini S&P 500Â® Index
Futures, the âWall Street 30,â which is based on CBOT E-mini DowÂ® Index Futures, and the
âUS SmallCap 2000,â which is based on CME E-mini Russell 2000Â® Index Futures.

44, In or about March 2017, Belsky entered into new verbal agreements with
Customers A and B that allowed Belsky to continue to surreptitiously trade funds in their
respective Nadex binary options trading accounts using their login credentials. In order to
induce Customers A and B to continue allowing him to trade their accounts, Belsky falsely
represented to them that he would be trading his own funds in their Nadex binary options trading
accounts. In reality, Belsky did not trade his own funds in the Nadex binary options trading
accounts of Customers A and B. Instead, Belsky transferred funds from his other customers to
Customers Aâs and Bâs Nadex binary options trading accounts and covertly traded those
customer funds using Customers Aâs and Bâs Nadex account login credentials.

45. Specifically, concerning Customer A, in March 2017 Belsky caused $48,000 from
his third-party customers to be deposited into Customer Aâs Nadex binary options trading
account. Belskyâs binary options trading of third-party customer funds in Customer Aâs account
resulted in the loss of approximately $42,500 before Belskyâs trading ceased.

46. Concerning Customer B, on March 9, 2017, Belsky caused $50,000 from his

third-party customers to be deposited into Customer Bâs Nadex binary options trading account.

11
Case 1:18-cv-05408 Documenti1 Filed 09/26/18 Page 12 of 24 PagelD #: 12

Belskyâs binary options trading of third-party customer funds in Customer Bâs account resulted
in the loss of almost all of the $50,000 before Belskyâs trading ceased.

E. Belskyâs Misappropriation of Customer Funds

47. Aside from the customer funds not lost through trading on Nadex, Belsky
misappropriated the vast majority of the customer funds he collected. Belsky used some
customer funds as his personal âpiggy bankâ to make car, school, and credit card payments, and
he also took large cash withdrawals that he used for unknown reasons.

48. For example, between approximately February 24, 2017, and February 27, 2017,
Belsky received wires totaling $335,000 from four customers, funds that he solicited for the
purpose of binary options trading and for which he promised to pay the customers ten percent per
month interest. Belsky directed the funds to be wired to his Y Trading account at Citizens Bank
in Brooklyn, NY.

49. Of the $335,000 in customer funds Belsky received between approximately
February 24, 2017, and February 27, 2017, only approximately $100,000 appears to be traceable
to deposits made to the Nadex binary options trading accounts held in the names of Customers A
and B.

50. From approximately February 24, 2017, through March 24, 2017, Belsky spent
approximately $20,000 of customerâs funds that had been previously deposited to his Y Trading
account at Citizens Bank to pay for personal expenses such as groceries, gasoline, and clothing,
and to make automobile and credit card internet payments. He also made cash withdrawals
totaling approximately $69,000.

51. At least $80,000 from the $335,000 in customer deposits made between February
24, 2017, and February 27, 2017, were used to repay Defendantsâ earlier customers, in a manner

akin to a Ponzi scheme.

12
Case 1:18-cv-05408 Documenti1 Filed 09/26/18 Page 13 of 24 PagelD #: 13

52. Similarly, on or about April 27, 2017, Customer C wired $70,000 to Belskyâs Y
Trading account at Citizens Bank for the purpose of binary options trading. From approximately
April 27, 2017, to July 31, 2017, Customer C made additional deposits totaling $180,000 into the
same Y Trading account.

53. During the same time period, Belsky withdrew approximately $125,000 of
Customer Câs funds in cash from the Y Trading account at Citizens Bank and Belsky spent
approximately $30,000 of Customer Câs funds on personal expenses. Belsky also appears to
have paid approximately $95,000 of Customer Câs monies to previous customers, in a manner
akin to a Ponzi scheme. Based on information and belief, none of Customer Câs funds were
deposited into any trading or investment accounts.

F. Belskyâs Material Omissions

54. During the Relevant Period, Belsky failed to disclose the following material facts

to the customers he solicited:

a. that the 2008 Order prohibited Belsky and his prior company, Innovative,
from trading on, or subject to, the rules of any registered entity;

b. that the Commission, in the 2008 Order, had found Belsky and Innovative
liable for defrauding their customers, including creating false account
statements and misappropriating customer funds;

C. that, contrary to his customer agreements and verbal representations,
Belsky was not depositing their funds into any Belsky or Y Trading binary
options trading account; and

d. that, contrary to his customer agreements and verbal representations,
Belsky was not using the majority of customer funds to trade binary
options but was instead misappropriating most of these funds to pay for
his personal expenses or, in some cases, to repay other customers in a
manner akin to a Ponzi scheme.

13
Case 1:18-cv-05408 Documenti1 Filed 09/26/18 Page 14 of 24 PagelD #: 14

G. Belskyâs Violations of the 2008 Order

55. As recited in the 2008 Order Belsky, acting as a registered commodity pool
operator and commodity trading advisor (âCTAâ), defrauded his pool participants of funds
totaling $1,250,000. According to the 2008 Order, instead of using the funds he had solicited to
purchase commodity futures and/or options contracts as promised, Belsky misappropriated at
least $385,000 and created false commodity pool account statements that he provided to
Innovative pool participants.

56. Belsky neither admitted nor denied the allegations and conclusions contained in
the 2008 Order, yet Belsky consented to the 2008 Order that required, among other things, that
he cease and desist from violating the provisions of the Act he was found to have violated, and
the payment of a civil monetary penalty of $100,000 and restitution in the amount of $1,250,000.
Additionally, the 2008 Order prohibited him from certain activities related to his violations in
order to protect the public.

57. Among its specific provisions, the 2008 Order permanently prohibited Belsky
from âdirectly or indirectly (a) trading on or subject to the rules of any registered entity, as that
term is defined in Section 1la(29) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1a(29) (2006).â

58. During the Relevant Period Belsky violated the 2008 Order by surreptitiously
conducting binary options trading on Nadex, a DCO that is a registered entity under the Act,
through at least two of his customersâ Nadex binary options trading accounts.

H. Belskyâs False Statements to the Commission
59. On February 21, 2018, during investigative testimony under oath before the
Commission, Belsky made false or misleading statements of material fact by repeatedly denying

to the Commission that he solicited customer funds for the alleged purpose of trading in binary

14
Case 1:18-cv-05408 Documenti1 Filed 09/26/18 Page 15 of 24 PagelD #: 15

options. These statements were material because Belskyâs use of the funds he solicited from

customers to trade binary options on Nadex would have violated the 2008 Order.

60.

In addition, during his February 21, 2018 investigative testimony under oath

before the Commission, Belsky made a series of false and misleading statements of material fact

regarding the trading he had conducted in his customersâ Nadex binary options trading accounts.

Specifically, Belsky repeatedly falsely denied that he had conducted any binary options trading

in any binary options trading accounts on Nadex, whether belonging to his customers or

otherwise. These statements were material because Belskyâs trading of binary options trading

accounts on Nadex would have violated the 2008 Order.

32.4(a) and (c), C.F.R. Â§ 32.4(a), (c) (2017)

The allegations set forth in the foregoing paragraphs are re-alleged and

incorporated herein by reference.

62.

63.

Section 4c(b) of the Act states, in relevant part:

No person shall offer to enter into, enter into or confirm the
execution of, any transaction involving any commodity regulated
under this Act which is of the character of, or is commonly known
to the trade as, an âoption, aa

privilege,â âindemnity,â âbid,â
âoffer,â âput,â âcall,â âadvance guaranty,â or âdecline guaranty,â
contrary to any rule, regulation, or order of the Commission
prohibiting any such transaction or allowing such transaction under
such terms and conditions as the Commission shall prescribe.

Regulation 32.4(a) and (c) makes it unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly,

to cheat or defraud or attempt to cheat or defraud any other person, or to deceive or attempt to

15
deceive any other person by any means whatsoever, in or in connection with any commodity
option transaction.

64. During the Relevant Period, Defendants cheated or defrauded, or attempted to
cheat or defraud, customers by making false representations in connection with, among other
things, the alleged success of Belskyâs binary options trading, providing of fictional trading
account statements to customers, assuming a false identity to solicit customers, and
misappropriating customer funds.

65. Defendants also failed to disclose material facts to customers regarding Belskyâs
background, including the existence of the 2008 Order in which the Commission determined that
Belsky had engaged in commodity pool fraud and that he was subject to a trading ban. Further,
Defendants failed to disclose that customer funds would not be transferred to any Y Trading
binary options trading accounts for binary options trading but instead would be used for Belskyâs
personal expenses, provided to other customers in a manner akin to a Ponzi scheme and, in some
cases, used by Belsky to trade binary options in other customersâ binary options trading
accounts.

66. Belsky controlled Y Trading and did not act in good faith or knowingly induced,
directly or indirectly, Y Tradingâs conduct alleged in this Count. Therefore, pursuant to Section
13(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13c(b) (2012), Belsky is liable for Y Tradingâs violations of Section
4c(b) of the Act and Regulation 32.4(a) and (c).

67. The foregoing acts, misrepresentations, omissions, and failures of Belsky
occurred within the scope of his employment, office, or agency with Y Trading. Therefore, Y
Trading is liable for these acts, misrepresentations, omissions, and failures pursuant to Section

2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(a)(1)(B) (2012), and Regulation 1.2, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.2 (2017).

68. Each act of misappropriation, misrepresentation, or omission of material fact
including, but not limited to, those specifically alleged herein, is alleged as a separate and
distinct violation of Section 4c(b) of the Act and Regulation 32.4(a) and (c).

currently codified in 1a(40) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1a(40) (2012).
72. Belskyâs conduct that violated the 2008 Order also violated Section 6c(a) of the
Act because Belsky has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in any act or practice
constituting a violation of an order issued under the Act and Regulations.
73. Each act constituting a violation of the 2008 Order including, but not limited to,

those specifically alleged herein, is alleged as a separate and distinct violation of Section 6c(a) of

FALSE STATEMENTS TO THE COMMISSION
Violation of Section 6(c)(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 9(2) (2012)

The allegations set forth in the foregoing paragraphs are re-alleged and

incorporated herein by reference.

85.

Section 6(c)(2) of the Act prohibits making false or misleading statements to the

Commission. This provision makes it unlawful for:

86.

any person to make any false or misleading statement of a material
fact to the Commission, including in any registration application or
any report filed with the Commission under this chapter, or any
other information relating to a swap, or a contract of sale of a
commodity, in interstate commerce, or for future delivery on or
subject to the rules of any registered entity, or to omit to state in
any such statement any material fact that is necessary to make any
statement of a material fact made not misleading in any material
respect, if the person knew, or reasonably should have known, the
statement to be false or misleading.

On February 21, 2018, during investigative testimony under oath before the

Commission, Belsky made false or misleading statements of material facts while he knew the

statements he made to be false. Specifically, Belsky repeatedly denied that he had solicited

customer funds for the purpose of trading binary options contracts in response to direct questions

by the Commission.

87.

Commission, Belsky made an additional series of false and misleading statements by denying

that he had at any time traded binary options in the Nadex binary options trading accounts of

Customers A and B in response to direct questions by the Commission.
