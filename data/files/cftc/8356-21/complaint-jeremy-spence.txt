JURY TRIAL DEMANDED

 

 

I. INTRODUCTION

1. From at least in or around December 2017 through at least in or around April
2019 (the âRelevant Periodâ), Jeremy Spence (âSpenceâ or âDefendantâ), doing business under
the name âCoin Signals,â operated a virtual currency Ponzi scheme in which he fraudulently
solicited individuals to invest funds in various pools that traded virtual currencies such as bitcoin
and ether, each a commodity in interstate commerce. During the Relevant Period, Defendant
obtained virtual currencies such as bitcoin and ether, worth more than $5 million from
individuals (âcustomersâ) comprising approximately 175 user accounts through fraudulent
solicitations involving misrepresentations of, among other things, his trading record, assets under
management, and highly profitable returns. In fact, as Defendant himself has admitted,
Defendantâs trading resulted in significant trading losses, and Defendant caused false
performance reports to be provided to customers. As in all Ponzi schemes, Defendantâs payouts
of supposed profits to customers in actuality consisted of other customersâ misappropriated
funds.

2. Through this conduct, Defendant has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage

in fraudulent acts and practices in violation of the Commodity Exchange Act (âActâ),
Case 1:21-cv-00699 Document1 Filed 01/26/21 Page 2 of 20

7 U.S.C. 8Â§ 1-26 (2018), and Commission Regulations (âRegulationsââ), 17 C.F.R. pts. 1-190
(2020), specifically Section 6(c)(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 9(1) (2018), and Regulation 180.1(a),
17 C.F.R. Â§ 180.1(a) (2020).

3. Accordingly, pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2018), the
Commission brings this action to enjoin such acts and practices and compel compliance with the
Act. In addition, the Commission seeks civil monetary penalties and remedial ancillary relief,
including, but not limited to, trading bans, restitution, disgorgement, rescission, pre- and post-
judgment interest, and such other relief as the Court may deem necessary and appropriate.

4. Unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, Defendant is likely to continue to
engage in the acts and practices alleged in this Complaint and similar acts and practices, as more
fully described below.

I. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

5. Jurisdiction. This Court has jurisdiction over this action under
28 U.S.C. Â§ 1331 (2018) (federal question jurisdiction) and 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1345 (2018) (district
courts have original jurisdiction over civil actions commenced by the United States or by any
agency expressly authorized to sue by Act of Congress). In addition, Section 6c(a) of the Act,
7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(a) (2018), authorizes the Commission to seek injunctive and other relief against
any person whenever it appears to the Commission that such person has engaged, is engaging, or
is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a violation of any provision of the Act or
any rule, regulation, or order thereunder.

6. Venue. Venue properly lies with the Court pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act,

7US.C. Â§ 13a-1(e) (2018), because Defendant is found in, inhabits, or transacts business in this
Case 1:21-cv-00699 Document1 Filed 01/26/21 Page 3 of 20

District, and because acts and practices in violation of the Act occurred, are occurring, or are
about to occur, within this District.

Hr. THE PARTIES

7. Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ or
CFTCâ) is an independent federal regulatory agency that is charged by Congress with the
administration and enforcement of the Act and the Regulations. The Commission maintains its
principal office at Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street, N.W. Washington, D.C. 20581.

8. Defendant Jeremy Spence is a natural person with a last known residence in New
York, New York. Spence has never been registered with the Commission. During the Relevant
Period, Spence did business under the name âCoin Signals.â

IV. FACTS

9. A virtual currency is a type of digital asset defined here as a digital representation
of value that functions as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and/or a store of value, but
does not have legal tender status in any jurisdiction. Bitcoin, ether, and other virtual currencies
are distinct from ârealâ currencies, which are the coin and paper money of the United States or
another country that are designated as legal tender, circulate, and are customarily used and
accepted as a medium of exchange in the country of issuance.

10. During the Relevant Period, Defendant solicited and received virtual currency
then equivalent to more than approximately $5,000,000 from customers comprising
approximately 175 user accounts, who invested amounts ranging from fractions of bitcoin to
virtual currency amounts worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, for the purpose of entering into
contracts of sale of virtual currency, including bitcoin and ether, through electronic web-based

virtual currency trading platforms based in various states and countries.

Case 1:21-cv-00699 Document1 Filed 01/26/21 Page 4 of 20

A. The Formation and Operation of Coin Signals

11. In or around late 2017, Defendant began doing business as Coin Signals (âCSâ)
for the purpose of soliciting customers and others in several of the United States as well as a
number of foreign countries to provide virtual currencies such as bitcoin and ether to Defendant,
which Defendant would employ in various âfundsâ to engage in virtual currency trading on the
customersâ behalf.

12. The CS funds included but were not limited to the Mex Fund (the âCS Mex
Fundâ), the Alt Fund (the âCS Alt Fundâ), and the Long-Term Fund (the âCS Long-Term Fundâ)
(collectively, the âCS Fundsâ).

13. During the Relevant Period, Defendant solicited customers and managed the CS
Funds from New York, New York.

14. Defendantâs trading strategies purportedly included seeking to trade virtual
currency profitably based on market volatility by, among other things, trading conservatively.

15. Defendant arranged with persons (âCS adminsâ) he met through online social
media sites such as Twitter, Telegram, and Discord internet chatrooms and otherwise to assist in
creating and to serve as administrators of CS chatrooms, to handle non-trading administrative
aspects of the CS Funds, and to act as conduits of information and solicitations to prospective
and existing customers.

16. Defendantâs solicitationsâwhich, as described below, were rife with fraud, lies,
and deceitâwere successful. During the Relevant Period, Defendant obtained virtual currencies
such as bitcoin and ether worth more than approximately $5 million from individual customers

comprising approximately 175 user accounts.
17. These customers included retail customers, that is, customers who were not high
net-worth individuals.
18. During the Relevant Period, Defendantâs primary virtual currency trading

accounts for the CS Mex Fund trading strategy were held at an international virtual currency
trading platform (the âCS Mex accountsâ). In the CS Mex accounts, Defendant engaged in
trading of contracts of virtual currencies such as bitcoin and ether, each a commodity in interstate
commerce, including on a futures contract basis (contracts in which the CS Mex account agreed
to trade, e.g., a commodity such as bitcoin or ether, at a predetermined price and specified time
in the future, e.g., in one week), swaps, and through the use of margin.

19. During the Relevant Period, Defendant engaged in trading of virtual currencies
via accounts on another international virtual currency trading platform (the âCS Alt accountsââ).

20. Defendant also employed other virtual currency accounts in furtherance of his
scheme.

21. Defendant communicated with customers regarding his trading strategy and
results in CS chatrooms directly and through CS admins.

22. Defendant also provided customers with information such as reports of his trading
results and customersâ account balances by âroundsâ that ranged from approximately a few days
to a few weeks. Defendantâs reportsâwhich, as described below, were false and misleadingâ
generally reflected successful and highly profitable virtual currency trading.

23. Defendant provided such trading and customer account information to customers
through an automated computer program referred to as a âbotâ (the âCS Botâ), which customers

could query on demand. For a given round, Defendant reported the CS Fundsâ trading profit-
Case 1:21-cv-00699 Document1 Filed 01/26/21 Page 6 of 20

and-loss results to a CS admin, who entered that information into the CS Bot, which then
calculated each customerâs resulting balance and profits or losses.

24. The profit-and-loss information reported at the end of each âroundâ was purported
to be realized profits or losses. This supposedly allowed customers to closely monitor their
investments and promptly withdraw funds as they wished.

B. Defendantâs False and Misleading Solicitations

25. During the Relevant Period, Defendantâs solicitations involved exaggerations of
his trading track record and ability to generate outsize returns.

26. In or around January 2018, in soliciting participation in CS, Defendant touted his
ability to trade successfully over the course of 2018 the funds that customers gave him to trade
**20xâââ that is, to trade so successfully and lucratively as to return 2,000% of a customerâs
investment by year end.

27. In or around March 2018, in a CS chatroom, the CS Mex Fund was touted as
having averaged more than 10% in weekly profits for at least two months.

28. Around the same time, Defendant solicited a customer by touting his consistent
trading gains of approximately 10% per month.

29. Defendant claimed to another prospective customer that he achieved his gains
through trading virtual currencies profitably based on market volatility.

30. These and other statements were false and misleading representations and omitted
material facts.

31. In fact, for the period January through March 2018, Defendantâs CS Mex
accountsâ trading records reflect unsuccessful virtual currency trading that resulted in significant

losses well in excess of $1,000,000 (the trading records reported these losses as more than 160

Mas

f SARE wT MOL Hea hake
a GO UL aL A

bitcoin, as the recordsâ convention was to reflect all profit and losses from trading of bitcoin,
ether, and other virtual currencies as denominated in Bitcoin).

32. During the Relevant Period, Defendantâs solicitations also involved substantial
overstatements of the amount of his assets under management.

33. These and other statements were false and misleading representations and
omissions of material facts.

34. For example, in or around early 2018, Defendant told one prospective customer
that Defendant had approximately $8 million in assets under management.

35. In fact, during the Relevant Period, Defendantâs net balances at his CS Mex
accounts and his CS Alt accounts never exceeded approximately $2 million. As of March 31,
2018, Defendantâs assets under management in those accounts was less than $1 million, and as
of September 30, 2018, Defendantâs assets under management in those accounts had dwindled to
virtual currency worth less than approximately $20,000 using the then-prevailing valuation.

36. Defendantâs solicitations also failed to disclose to customers that Defendant was
misappropriating customer funds.

37. For example, Defendant stated to customers that he requested a voluntary
payment equal to 15% of customer profits, which Defendant referred to as a âTip.â

38. These and other of Defendantâs statements concerning his compensation were
false and misleading representations and omissions of material facts.

39. In fact, customers generally were automatically charged the 15% fee based on

Defendantâs purported profitable trading.
be:
AO. But because Defendant suffered trading losses, Defendant was not entitled to such

fees. Any âTipsâ Defendant paid himself based on fictitious profits were, in fact, paid from
customer funds and therefore misappropriated.

41. For example, in or around September 2018, the CS Bot reported to one customer
that as a result of Defendantâs purportedly successful trading during that âround,â the customerâ s
CS Mex Fund was charged approximately a .5 bitcoin âTipâ based on Defendantâs then
ââ{clurrent [r]ound [g]ainâ of more than 5%.

42. In fact, as of that date, the CS Mex accounts records show Defendantâs
unsuccessful virtual currency trading had resulted in losses equivalent to more than $250,000
(the records reflect these losses, denominated by convention in Bitcoin, as more than forty
bitcoin).

43. Similarly, like all Ponzi schemes, because Defendant suffered trading losses,
customer withdrawals during the Relevant Period based on the purported profits in fact were
funds misappropriated from other customers.

44. Defendant made these and other false and misleading representations and
omissions of material facts to prospective customers directly and through agents during the
Relevant Period in person, by telephone, and online.

45. Defendant made these and other false and misleading representations and
omissions of material facts to prospective customers as well as existing customers directly and

through agents knowingly or with reckless disregard for the truth.
Case 1:21-cv-00699 Document1 Filed 01/26/21 Page 9 of 20

Cc. Defendant Misrepresented the Performance and Balance of the Funds

46. During the Relevant Period, by the CS Bot and otherwise, Defendant caused
numerous reports to be issued to customers claiming that their accounts or the overall balance of
the funds had increased in value.

47. These reports were false and misleading.

48. For example, in or around September 2018, the CS Bot reported to one customer
that as a result of Defendantâs purportedly successful virtual currency trading during that
âround,â the customerâs CS Mex Fund deposit of more than fifty-five bitcoin (equivalent to more
than approximately $325,000 using the then-prevailing valuation) had enjoyed profits of more
than 5%, and that the value of the customerâs deposit had increased by more than 12% in a
matter of weeks.

49. In fact, for the month of September 2018, the CS Mex accounts records show
Defendantâs unsuccessful virtual currency trading had resulted in losses equivalent to more than
$250,000 (the records reflect these losses, denominated by convention in Bitcoin, as in excess of
forty bitcoin).

50. Similarly, Defendant caused one customer to receive a report stating that the
customerâs initial investment had increased in value by more than 7% in a matter of weeks due to
Defendantâs purported successful virtual currency trading.

51. In fact, from that customerâs initial investment to around the time of the additional
investment, the CS Mex accounts records show that Defendantâs virtual currency trading had
resulted in losses equivalent to approximately $600,000 to $700,000 (the records reflect these

losses, denominated by convention in Bitcoin, as approximately 100 bitcoin).
52. By indicating that customersâ accounts virtually always increased in value each

âround,â the statements also served as fraudulent solicitations for customers to invest additional
funds with Defendant.

53. For example, as a result of receiving a false and misleading report of 7% growth
in a matter of weeks, a customer invested an additional more than sixty bitcoin (equivalent to
more than approximately $375,000 using the then-prevailing valuation) in Defendantâs CS Mex
Fund.

54. On or about October 1, 2018, Defendant claimed to customers in a CS chatroom
that over the previous nine months the CS Mex Fund had grown âfrom just 10btcs to 1300btcs
today.â

55. As of on or about October 1, 2018, 1,300 bitcoin was approximately equivalent to
more than $8 million using the then-prevailing valuation.

56. In fact, on or about October 1, 2018, the total balance in the CS Mex accounts and
the CS Alt accounts was approximately one bitcoin (equivalent to approximately $6,500 using
the then-prevailing valuation).

57. Defendant made these and other false and misleading representations and
omissions of material facts to customers directly and through agents during the Relevant Period
in person, by telephone, and online.

58. Defendant made these and other false and misleading representations and
omissions of material facts to customers directly and through agents knowingly or with reckless

disregard for the truth.

10
Case 1:21-cv-00699 Document1 Filed 01/26/21 Page 11 of 20

D. Defendantâs False and Misleading Claims of a Hack

59. Beginning in or around August 2018, when customers requested withdrawals of
the investments, Defendant offered a series of excuses for delays in repayment, falsely
represented that there were sufficient balances in CSâs bitcoin accounts, and failed to pay
redemption requests from customers.

60. In or about Fall 2018, to explain delays in meeting customersâ withdrawal
demands, Defendant represented that CS had experienced a security issueâa âhackâââthat
caused approximately forty bitcoin in losses (approximately equivalent to more than $250,000
using the then-prevailing valuation).

61. In or about November 2018, Defendant represented that the âhackâ actually had
resulted in approximately 150 bitcoin in losses (approximately equivalent to $1,000,000 using
the then-prevailing valuation).

62. These statements were false and misleading.

63. In fact, on and around the date of the purported hack, the total balance in the CS
Mex accounts and the CS Alt accounts never reached 150 bitcoin (approximately equivalent to
$1,000,000 using the then-prevailing valuation).

64. Around the date of the purported hack, records of the CS Mex accounts and CS
Alt accounts reflect no withdrawals of approximately 150 bitcoin, whether attributable to a
âhackâ or not.

65. In fact, the CS Mex accounts records for September 2018 reflect virtual currency
trading lossesânot a âhackâââin excess of $250,000 (records reflect these losses, denominated

by convention in Bitcoin, as more than forty bitcoin).

11
Case 1:21-cv-00699 Document1 Filed 01/26/21 Page 12 of 20

66. Defendant made these and other false and misleading representations and
omissions of material facts to customers concerning the âhackâ directly and through agents
during the Relevant Period.

67. Defendant made these and other false and misleading representations and
omissions of material facts to customers directly and through agents knowingly or with reckless
disregard for the truth.

E. Defendantâs False and Misleading âProofs of Fundsâ

68. On or about November 4, 2018, in an effort to reassure customers that they would
receive their full balances soon, Defendant stated to customers that âsince the beginning the
[M]ex [F]und is up almost 500btcs (sic).â

69. This statement was false and misleading.

70. In fact, from the opening of the CS Mex accounts through on or about November
4, 2018, the CS Mex Fund trade records show virtual currency trading losses of more than
approximately $1,400,000 (the records reflect these losses, denominated by convention in
Bitcoin, as more than 200 bitcoin).

71. In late 2018, to substantiate his claims of sufficient remaining assets to return
customersâ balances, Defendant provided purported proofs of funds to his agents for them to
convey to the customers.

72. Defendantâs agents then conveyed the sum and substance of these purported
proofs to customers.

73. These purported proofs of funds were false and misleading.

74. For example, in or about November 2018, Defendant showed purported

screenshots of the CS Mex accounts reflecting balances totaling in excess of several hundred

12
Case 1:21-cv-00699 Document1 Filed 01/26/21 Page 13 of 20

bitcoin (equivalent to more than approximately $3,000,000 using the then-prevailing valuation).
This information in sum and substance was conveyed to customers.

75. In fact, through November 2018, Defendantâs bitcoin, ether, and other virtual
currency trading had resulted in the equivalent of hundreds of bitcoin in losses.

76. In fact, at no point during November 2018 did the balance of the CS Mex
accounts exceed ten bitcoin, much less the several hundred bitcoin that Defendant had
represented.

77. Defendant made these and other false and misleading representations and
omissions of material facts to customers concerning the âproofs of fundsâ directly and through
agents during the Relevant Period.

78. Defendant made these and other false and misleading representations and

omissions of material facts to customers directly and through agents knowingly or with reckless

 

disregard for the truth.
F. Defendantâs Admissions of His Lies and Deceit
79. In late 2018, after numerous efforts to conceal his misconduct and to forestall

customersâ withdrawal requests, Defendant admitted to deceiving and misleading his customers.

80. In or around that time, in a chat to CS customers, Defendant admitted, âIâve spent
the past two months trying to hide my drawdowns with lies and deceit.â

81. Also in or around that time in a chat to CS customers, Defendant acknowledged
that he had concealed and misrepresented losses to his customers, admitting, âI should have been
more honest with my losses.â

82. In or around that time, Defendant claimed that he had lied about the size of the
purported hack and had downplayed it to deceive his customers.

13
Case 1:21-cv-00699 Document1 Filed 01/26/21 Page 14 of 20

83. In or around that time, Defendant also claimed that, contrary to the conservative
strategy and prompt realization of profits he had represented to customers, he had opened and
held a long bitcoin position that had suffered significant losses.
