ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTIONS 6(c) AND 6(d) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, MAKING
FINDINGS AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

I.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ) has reason to believe that
between July 2014 and July 2015 (the âRelevant Periodâ), Brandon Elsasser (ââRespondentâ or
âElsasserâââ) violated Section 4c(a) of the Commodity Exchange Act (âActâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6c(a)
(2012), and Commission Regulation (âRegulationâ) 1.38(a), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.38(a) (2016).
Therefore, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest that public
administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted to determine whether Respondent
engaged in the violations set forth herein and to determine whether any order should be issued
imposing remedial sanctions.

Il.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Respondent has
submitted an Offer of Settlement (âOfferâ), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Without admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, Respondent consents to
the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 6(c) and 6(d) of the
Commodity Exchange Act, Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (âOrderââ) and
acknowledges service of this Order.â

 

Respondent consents to the entry of this Order and to the use of these findings in this
proceeding and in any other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission
is a party; provided, however, that Respondent does not consent to the use of the Offer, or the
findings or conclusions in this Order consented to in the Offer, as the sole basis for any other
proceeding brought by the Commission, other than in a proceeding in bankruptcy or to enforce
the terms of this Order. Nor does Respondent consent to the use of the Offer or this Order, or the
II.
The Commission finds the following:
A. SUMMARY

During the Relevant Period, Elsasser engaged in a fictitious trading strategy in order to
generate rebates from an exchangeâs market maker program. Elsasser discovered that he could
trade against himself in rebate-eligible products and avoid detection using the exchangeâs
implied matching engine. Elsasser entered orders for several Eurodollar pack butterfly spreads
on one side of the market and then entered orders on the opposite side of the market for
Eurodollar pack spreads with component legs that contained the same underlying contracts.
Using this technique, Elsasser traded against himself and generated rebates that benefitted his
trading group and his employerâs house account. As such, Elsasserâs trading constituted
fictitious, wash sales in violation of Section 4c(a) and non-competitive transactions in violation
of Regulation 1.38(a).

B. RESPONDENT

During the Relevant Period, Brandon Elsasser (âElsasserââ) was a trader employed by
Rosenthal Collins Capital Markets LLC (â*âRCCMâââ) in Chicago, Illinois, and he traded for a
division within RCCM known as DV Trading. Elsasser was not registered with the Commission
during the Relevant Period.

OF FACTS
1. CMEâs Eurodollar Pack and Bundle Market Maker Program

During the Relevant Period, RCCM was a participant in the Eurodollar Pack and Bundle
Market Maker Program (âProgramââ) offered by Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Inc. (ââCMEâ or
âexchangeâ).â Elsasser was designated as one of several RCCM traders in the Program. Under
the terms of the Program, RCCM had certain quoting obligations and, in return, it could earn
rebates for its trading in the Eurodollar pack and bundles. Pursuant to the Program, RCCM
received the rebates in the form of credits on the exchange fees that it had incurred for its trading
(ârebatesâ). The rebates RCCM earned through Eurodollar pack and bundle trading could be
applied to offset exchange fees for any trading RCCM had done in the Eurodollar complex.

Eurodollar packs and bundles are groups of Eurodollar futures contracts that allow
market participants to purchase or sell a series of Eurodollar futures representing a particular

proceeding.

there were several different agreements in effect during the Relevant Period.
segment along the yield curve.â Market participants may trade Eurodollar packs and bundles at a
single price, eliminating the necessity of entering multiple orders and the possibility that some
orders may go unfilled. Under the Program, the amount of the potential rebate credit increased
as the Eurodollar Pack and Bundle contracts extend further out along the yield curve. For
example, trading in Eurodollar packs that extend seven years into the future would generate more
credits than trading in Eurodollar packs that extend only two years into the future.

The CME provides electronic markets for specific Eurodollar packs and bundles as well
as electronic markets for the individual, underlying contracts. When a market participant enters
an order for a Eurodollar pack or bundle, the exchange can either: (1) match that order with an
identical pack or bundle order on the opposite side, or (11) if there is not an identical pack or
bundle on the opposite side, it can break apart the pack or bundle into individual contracts or
smaller spreads in order to fill all of the contracts contained in the original order. The latter
technique is known as âimpliedâ matching.

In the spring of 2014, CME informed RCCM that it would exclude self-matches among
traders at the same firm before calculating rebate credits.

2. Elsasser Entered into Fictitious Trades In Order to Generate Rebates

In mid-2014, RCCM was not generating its desired level of rebates in the Program.
Elsasser began trading in the Program at that time and discovered that he was able to match his
own orders without detection and still earn rebates on wash trades using the exchangeâs implied
matching engine. Elsasser entered orders for several Eurodollar pack butterfly spreads on one
side of the market and then entered orders on the opposite side of the market for Eurodollar pack
spreads that contain the same underlying contracts."

Using this technique, Elsasser was able to trade against himself in products subject to the
Program for approximately 12 months. Elsasserâs strategy was so effective that he generated
rebates in excess of his groupâs Eurodollar trading fees, and he distributed the rebates among
other RCCM traders and the house account at RCCM.

 

> A Eurodollar bundle consists of the simultaneous sale or purchase of one each of a series of

consecutive Eurodollar futures contracts. Eurodollar packs represent a series of four consecutive
quarterly Eurodollar futures.

* A butterfly spread involves the placing of two inter-delivery spreads in opposite directions

with the center delivery month common to both spreads. CME Group Glossary at

IV.
LEGAL DISCUSSION

A. Elsasser Entered into Fictitious Trades in Violation of Section 4c(a)

Section 4c(a) of the Act makes it âunlawful for any person to offer to enter into, enter
into, or confirm the execution of a transactionââ that âis, is of the character of, or is
commonly known to the trade as, a âwash saleâ... .ââ 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6c(a) (2012). A wash sale
is a form of fictitious sale. In re Gimbel, [1987-1990 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep.
(CCH) J 24,213 at 35,003 (CFTC Apr. 14, 1988), aff'd as to liability, 872 F.2d 196 (7th Cir.
1989).

Wash sales are harmful, in part, because they create illusory price movements in the
market. Wilson v. CFTC, 322 F.3d 555, 559 (8th Cir. 2003); Reddy v. CFTC, 191 F.3d 109,
115 (2d Cir. 1999); see also CFTC v. Savage, 611 F.2d 270, 284 (9th Cir. 1980) (wash sales
may mislead market participants because they do not reflect the forces of supply and demand).
They also are considered âgraveâ violations because âthey undermine confidence in the market
mechanism that underlies price discovery.â Jn re Piasio, [1999-2000 Transfer Binder] Comm.
Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) 50,691 (CFTC Sept. 29, 2000), aff'd after remand and further
proceedings, sub nom. Piasio v. CFTC, 54 Fed. Appx. 702, [2002-2003 Transfer Binder]
Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) J 29,251 (2d Cir. Dec. 31, 2002).

In order to establish that a wash sale has occurred, the Commission must show that
the transaction at issue achieved a wash result. The Commission may demonstrate that the
trades resulted in a wash by (1) the purchase and sale (2) of the same delivery month of the
same futures contract (3) at the same (or a similar) price. Wilson, 322 F.3d at 559; In re
Gilchrist, [1990-1992 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) 9 24,993 at 37,653
(CFTC Jan. 25, 1991); see also Inre Citadel Trading, [1986-1987 Transfer Binder] Comm.
Fut. L.Rep (CCH) J 23,082 at 32,190 (CFTC May 12, 1986) (âOrders to purchase and sell
for the account of the same customer the identical quantity of the same futures contract at
identical prices were entered virtually simultaneously.ââ)

In addition to the factors enumerated by the Commission in Gilchrist, the Commission
must prove intent to establish a violation of Section 4c of the Act. Reddy, 191 F.3d at 119. A
traderâs intent to negate risk or price competition and avoid a bona fide market position may
involve explicit prearrangement, or it can be inferred âfrom the intentional structuring of a
transaction in a manner to achieve the same result as prearrangement.â Jn re Three Eight
Corp.,[1992-1994 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L.Rep. (CCH) { 25,749 at 40,444 n.15
(CFTC June 16, 1993); see also In re Elliott, [1996-1998 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep.
(CCH) { 27,243 at 46,007 (CFTC Feb. 3, 1998), aff'd, Elliott v. CFTC, 202 F.3d 926 (7th Cir.
2000) (finding wash trading among traders who were buying and selling spreads to each other
at the same price differential when the trades reflected a âprecision and symmetry not generally
found in competitive tradingâ).
Placing offsetting orders to buy and sell, while simultaneously taking steps to âenhance
the likelihood that the buy and sell orders would be filled at the same or a similar priceâ is
persuasive evidence that the trader intends to negate risk and price competition. Jn re Collins
[1986-1987 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) Â¥ 22,982 at 31,900 (CFTC Apr. 4,
1986), revâdon other grounds sub nom. Stoller v. CFTC, 834 F.2d 262 (2d Cir. 1987) ; see also
In re Piasio, [1999-2000 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) at 50,689-91 (finding
customer who placed paired buy and sell orders, with specific pricing and loss limitation
instructions, âstructured orders to negate riskâ and thus had intent to violate Section 4c).
Traders violate Section 4c when they avoid taking bona fide positions in the market and
simply buy and sell the same product at the same price in order to generate exchange
rebates See In re Gelber Grp., LCC, [2012-2013 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH)
{ 32,534 at 72,115 (CFTC Feb. 8, 2013) (consent order imposing $750,000 civil monetary
penalty against proprietary trading firm, finding two proprietary traders, at the direction of a
trading group manager, had engaged in wash trades in certain Russell Index futures contracts
on the Intercontinental Exchange in order to inflate firmâs trading volume to enable it to obtain
increased rebates from exchange as part of an incentive program); In re Martin A. Lorenzen,
[2012-2013 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) J 32,534 (CFTC Feb. 8, 2016)
(consent order imposing $200,000 civil monetary penalty against manager of trading group,
finding manager liable as a controlling person for directing two traders to engage in wash
sales).

Elsasser violated Section 4c(a) of the Act by entering into transactions of the character of
and commonly known as wash sales. Elsasser knowingly entered into the wash sales with the
intent of inflating his trading volume in order to generate additional rebates from the Program.

B. Elsasser Executed Trades Noncompetitively in Violation of Regulation 1.38(a)

With certain exceptions not relevant here, Regulation 1.38(a) requires that âall purchases
and sales of any commodity for future delivery, and of any commodity option, on or subject to
the rules of a contract market shall be executed openly and competitively by open outcry or
posting of bids and offers or by other equally open and competitive methods, in the trading pit or
ring or similar place provided by the contract market, during the regular hours prescribed by the
contract market for trading in such commodity or commodity option ....â 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.38(a)
(2016).

Noncompetitive trades are a type of fictitious sale because they negate the risk incidental
to an open and competitive market. Jn re Fisher, [2003-2004 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L.
Rep. (CCH) J 29,725 at 56,052 n.11 (CFTC Mar. 24, 2004). Prearranged trading is a form of
anti-competitive trading that violates Regulation 1.38(a). In re Shell US Trading Co., [2005-2007
Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) { 30,161 at 57,632 (CFTC Jan. 4, 2006) (consent
order); In re Gimbel, [1987-1990 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) at 35,003.

Elsasser violated Regulation 1.38 by executing trades noncompetitively. Elsasser
knowingly entered into the noncompetitive trades with the intent of inflating his Eurodollar pack
and bundle trading volumes in order to generate additional rebates from the Program.
In accepting Respondentâs Offer, the Commission recognizes Respondentâs significant
cooperation during the investigation of this matter with the CFTCâs Division of Enforcement
(âDivisionâ), in the form of a proffer and providing additional evidence of value to the
Divisionâs investigation.
