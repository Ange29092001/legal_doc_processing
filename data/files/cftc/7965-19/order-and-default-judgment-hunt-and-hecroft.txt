II. FINDINGS OF FACT
A. The Parties

1. Plaintiff Commission is an independent federal regulatory agency charged by
Congress with the administration and enforcement of the Commodity Exchange Act (the âActâ
or âCEAâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1-26 (2012), and the Commission Regulations (âRegulationsâ)
promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. pt. 1-190 (2018). (Compl. { 15.)

address in Arlington, Texas, and Hunt later indicated to L.M. that he had received a package sent
by L.M. to that address. (Compl. Tf 3, 16.)

3. Defendant Hecroft is an individual whose last known residence, according to
Hecroft, is in Baltimore, Maryland, and who did business under names including âKim Hecroftâ
and âFirst Options Trading,â neither of which has ever been registered with the Commission in
any capacity. (Compl. { 17.)

B. Huntâs Use of Facebook To Solicit Customers

4. On or about February 16, 2017, Hunt set up a Google account for the email
address morganhunttrusts @ gmail.com. For a recovery email, Hunt provided Google with the
address kimhecroft@ gmail.com. This recovery email address was the same address that Hecroft
set up on or about January 3, 2017, and was the same email address Hecroft used to perpetuate
his fraud, as described below. (Compl. J 18.)

5. On or about February 16, 2017, Hunt used the email address
morganhunttrusts@gmail.com to create a Facebook profile under the name âMorgan Huntâ
(https://www.facebook.com/morgan.hunt.1656), and subsequently used that profile to create a
Facebook page entitled âTrading With Morgan Huntâ (https://www.facebook.com/
tradingwithmorganhunt). (Compl. J 19.)

6. According to his Facebook profile, as of June 22, 2018, Hunt had studied

and 2018. (Compl. { 20.)
Case 4:18-cv-00807-O Document17 Filed 06/28/19 Page 4of37 PagelD 287

7. Beginning in or around March 2017, Hunt made a series of Facebook posts
containing images purporting to show forex trading activity in various currency pairs, with the
words âEXPIRED POSITION DETAILSâ at the top of each image. Hunt introduced these
images with statements on his Facebook page such as âTrading Signals for the weekend,â
âTraded accounts for the week,â and âTraded Accounts for last week.â (Compl. { 21.)

8. Beginning in or around April 2017, Hunt began including references to diamonds
in his posts about purported forex trading activity, such as: âDiamonds Investments Trust,â
âDiamonds Are Forever,â âDiamonds Exchange Trading Rocks,â âLatest Trend In Bitcoins
Diamonds Trust,â âDiamonds Traded On the Commodities Exchange!!!â and âAccolades to the
diamonds exchange!!!â (Compl. { 22.)

9. On or about May 5, 2017, Hunt commented, in reference to one of his posts
showing purported forex trading activity: âItâs the bitcoins diamonds exchange. Awesome
profits generated from it.â (Compl. { 23.)

10. Between approximately March 2017 and January 2018, at least 11 Facebook users
posted public comments in response to Huntâs Facebook posts, asking for information about
Huntâs trading and how to participate in the investment opportunity Hunt was offering. In
response to such comments, Hunt generally responded by indicating that he would communicate
with the users by private message. For instance, on or about May 28, 2017, in response to Hunt
posting images showing purported forex trading activity in three different currency pairs, a
Facebook user commented, âhow does the diamond exchange tradeing [sic] work,â to which
Hunt replied, âI will inbox you.â (Compl. J 24.)

11. All of Huntâs representations about his trading activity and expertise that he

publicly posted on his Facebook page were false. (Compl. { 25.)
Case 4:18-cv-00807-O Document 17 Filed 06/28/19 Page5of37 PagelD 288

12. Hunt had never been employed at the investment firms listed on his profile, was
not engaged in any profitable forex trading activity during the Relevant Period, and was not
involved in any legitimate business venture under any of the names (e.g., âDiamonds
Investments Trustâ) mentioned in his Facebook posts. (Compl. J 26.)

OF Solicitation and Transfer of L.M.âs Bitcoins to Hunt

13. On or about October 19, 2017, Hunt began exchanging private Facebook
messages (hereinafter âFacebook chatâ messages) with L.M., a retired California resident.
(Compl. { 27.)

14. On or about November 3, 2017, L.M. stated to Hunt that he was interested in
forex trading and had previously traded forex for himself but âlose [sic] everything because I
didnât really know what I was doing.â (Compl. J 28.)

15. Hunt told L.M. that his investment product was called âthe Bitcoins Diamonds
Trustâ and that it âguarantees a passive investment return of 40-60% after a 30 day trading
cycle.â Hunt sent L.M. a link to a 29-second Youtube video posted by âDiamond Invest Club,â
in which a man stated that âDiamond Investâ offered a forex investment product that could
produce profits of 150 to 288 percent in 120 days. (Compl. J 29.)

16. L.M. told Hunt that he was on Social Security disability and needed âto get some
of my monthly income working for me,â and that he had âlost everything Iâve ever invested.â
L.M. asked Hunt whether he could invest $100 per month; Hunt responded that he had a âtrading
minimumâ of $1,000, and assured L.M. that âyou have nothing to loose [sic] in this.â (Compl.
{ 30.)

17. Hunt represented that L.M. would be investing his funds in a pooled investment

vehicle. On or about November 3, 2017, in response to L.M.âs inquiry whether Hunt had âpool
Case 4:18-cv-00807-O Document 17 Filed 06/28/19 Page 6of37 PagelD 289

accounts that several people contribute to,â Hunt stated, âYes, thatâs also an outstanding platform
to leverage on the Collective Investments Scheme.â On February 2, 2018, Hunt told L.M., âI
want us to set up a 100k portfolio with a pool investment scheme.â On or about February 19,
2018, Hunt told L.M. that he would âimmediatelyâ start up a âpool schemeâ when he got two
more investors; and on or about February 20, 2018, Hunt reported to L.M. that â[a] lot of
investors just keyed into the pool trading scheme.â Hunt told L.M. that Hunt had âover 100
clientsâ and was âcurrently running a mutual fund for pool investors.â (Compl. J 31.)

18. On January 22, 2018, L.M. proposed making an investment of $2,000, and Hunt
stated that he would achieve trading returns of 30 to 60 percent each month on a $2,000 principal
investment. (Compl. J 32.)

19. On January 22 and 23, 2018, Hunt provided L.M. with instructions to create a
Bitcoin wallet, purchase Bitcoins using the cryptocurrency payment processor Coinmama, and
transfer Bitcoins to Huntâs wallet at another cryptocurrency payment processor, Remitano. Over
these two days, Hunt spent several hours communicating with L.M. by Facebook chat and
videochat in order to facilitate L.M.âs transfer of funds. (Compl. J 33.)

20. On January 23, 2018, L.M. transferred approximately $2,000 worth of Bitcoins to
Hunt. (Compl. { 34.)

21. On February 2, 2018, Hunt emailed to L.M. (using his email address
morganhunttrusts @ gmail.com, which was the address he always used when emailing L.M.) a
document he claimed was âan update on the status of your portfolio,â which purported to show
significant trading profits, and Hunt suggested to L.M. that L.M. âdouble the initial investments

sum.â (Compl. { 35.)
Case 4:18-cv-00807-O Document17 Filed 06/28/19 Page 7 of37 PagelD 290

22. Later on February 2, 2018, L.M. made a second transfer of Bitcoins to Hunt,
worth approximately $2,000. (Compl. { 36.)

23. On February 15, 2018, L.M. made a third transfer of Bitcoins to Hunt, worth
approximately $100. (Compl. J 37.)

24. Beginning on February 2, 2018, Hunt emailed L.M. account statements on an
approximately weekly basis that purported to show that Hunt was achieving enormous trading
profits for L.M. (Compl. J 38.)

25. The account statements were in the form of letters, either addressed to L.M. or to
L.M.âs four children (after Hunt had purportedly permitted L.M. to divide his funds among
accounts in the names of his children), and signed by a âSteven McGill,â purportedly a
âLiquidation Officerâ for âDiamonds Trading Investment.â (Compl. J 39.)

26. L.M. understood from Huntâs representations about his trading results, as well as
from Huntâs representations, beginning on or about November 3, 2017, or earlier, about Huntâs
use of âleverage,â that L.M.âs funds were being used by Hunt to trade forex on a margined or
leveraged basis. (Compl. J 40.)

27. On June 28, 2018âapproximately five months after L.M.âs initial investmentâ
Hunt represented to L.M. that his principal investment of approximately $4,000 had
âaccumulated a profitâ of over $200,000, which was a purported gain of more than 5,000
percent. (Compl. J 41.)

28. All of the account statements and updates that Hunt provided to L.M. were

fraudulent and entirely fictitious. (Compl. J 42.)
Case 4:18-cv-00807-O Document 17 Filed 06/28/19 Page 8of37 PagelD 291

29. Hunt never engaged in any profitable forex trading during the Relevant Period,
and rather than using L.M.âs funds to trade forex, Hunt misappropriated the funds. (Compl.
{ 43.)

D. Huntâs Solicitation of Additional Customers Referred by L.M.

30. Beginning on or about February 2, 2018, Hunt began suggesting to L.M. that he
could earn referral commissions by soliciting others to invest their own funds with Hunt. On
February 2, 2018, Hunt told L.M. that â[i]t would be nice if you bring your friends to on board,
Ill open a Collective Investment Scheme and you'll be making great referral commissions aside
your monthly earnings... . You'll be earning consistently as long as they keep coming in....
The payout commission is instant.â (Compl. J 44.)

31. On or about February 5, 2018, Hunt emailed L.M. a document that Hunt said was
âthe commission contract I told you about[.] Where you receive 10% in commissions on any
investor you refer[.| And itâs instant payment.â (Compl. J 45.)

32. On February 10, 2018, in response to L.M. mentioning that he had a friend who
was concerned about Bitcoins, Hunt told L.M. that he should âconvince her to invest,â because
âas you know there is a referral commission scheme on this program . .. 10% commission
payable instantly on any investor you bring.â (Compl. { 46.)

33. On February 13, 2018, Hunt again asked L.M. to solicit others: âI really want us
to make this big. .. . Probably sign up one or two participants so that your earning scheme can
improve by way of referral commissions.â L.M. responded, âI understand this, but my friends
are really hesitant and donât believe the returns. I keep sharing, but no takers yet.â (Compl.

447.)
Case 4:18-cv-00807-O Document 17 Filed 06/28/19 Page 9of37 PagelD 292

34. On March 7, 2018, Hunt asked L.M. if he had any referrals; L.M. responded in
the negative but that he was âworking on them.â (Compl. J 48.)

35. On April 4, 2018, Hunt reiterated to L.M.: âWe need an expansion, keep telling
your friends and family about this.â (Compl. J 49.)

36. On or about April 29, 2018, L.M. solicited a friend (âW.â) to invest with Hunt and
directed him to Huntâs Facebook profile. On April 30, 2018, Hunt informed L.M. that W. had
contacted Hunt and that L.M. would earn a referral commission from any investment W. made:
âT also got a message from your friend [W.] and... Pll recommend you expand your earning
scheme through his referral commission.â Hunt stated: â[W.âs] Investments earns you a
commission and a trading bonus of about $2000 which is payable instantly.â (Compl. { 50.)
E. Huntâs Further Misrepresentations To Conceal His Fraud

37. In late April 2018, L.M. informed Hunt by email that he wished to withdraw
approximately $7,000 from his accountâwhich, by that time had, according to statements
provided by Hunt, purportedly grown to tens of thousands of dollars. (Compl. J 51.)

38. In order to conceal his misappropriation and continue his fraud, Hunt sought to
dissuade L.M. from withdrawing funds from his account by deceiving him about the tax
implications of such a withdrawal. (Compl. { 52.)

39. On May 3, 2018, Hunt told L.M. that, because he invested through transfers of
Bitcoins, if L.M. withdrew any of his funds he would have to pay â10% taxation on the whole
portfolio.â According to Hunt, although L.M.âs funds were being used to trade forex, L.M.âs

âwhole portfolio . . . is still taxableâ because âthe leverage instrument is Crypto.â (Compl. J 53.)
Case 4:18-cv-00807-O Document 17 Filed 06/28/19 Page 10 of 37 PagelD 293

40. Hunt then told L.M. that he would have âto comply with the tax prior to
liquidation,â 1.e., he would have to pay the tax using new funds, not the funds that were
supposedly in his investment account with Hunt. (Compl. J 54.)

Al. As Hunt knew, L.M. had no such fundsâoutside of the amount that was invested
in Huntâs pooled investment vehicleâwith which he could purchase an amount of Bitcoin even
approaching ten percent of his purported account balance with Hunt. (Compl. { 55.)

42. In response to L.M.âs questions, Hunt variously attributed the ten percent tax to a
recent federal court ruling, to ânew legislation in force,â and to a ânew regulation in place which
overulled [sic] the previous system.â Hunt told L.M. that the âtax is handled by the CFTCâ and
is âpaid to a secure CFTC wallet.â (Compl. { 56.)

43. All of Huntâs representations about the tax were knowingly false. There is no
legislation, regulation, or court ruling that requires a tax of ten percent of an investorâs portfolio
to be paid to the CFTC prior to the withdrawal of funds. (Compl. J 57.)

44, When L.M. told Hunt, on May 4, 2018, that he was attempting to contact the
CFTC to inquire about the tax, Hunt told L.M. that he would connect L.M. with âa friend who
works with CFTC and heâll help you with that.â (Compl. J 58.)

45. On May 7, 2018, Hunt identified the âfriendâ to L.M. as âCorey,â a âFutures
Trading Specialist/ Investigator with CFTC.â On May 8, 2018, a person identifying himself as
Corey and claiming to be a CFTC official called L.M. on the telephone. âCoreyâ supported
Huntâs story about the liquidation tax and told L.M. that his office had the power to make L.M.âs
âportfolio appear on the surface to be frozen while it is really still growingâ so that L.M.âs tax

obligation would be limited to ten percent of his account balance as of that moment. (Compl.

q 59.)

10
Case 4:18-cv-00807-O Document 17 Filed 06/28/19 Page 11of37 PagelD 294

46. âCoreyâ was an associate of Hunt who was assisting Hunt with his fraudulent
scheme, and was not a person affiliated with the CFTC in any way. (Compl. { 60.)

47. Hunt subsequently attempted to dissuade L.M. from making further inquiries to
the CFTC, advising him to âlay lowâ and warning him that âcontacting CFTC personally will
open a can of worms.â (Compl. { 61.)

F. Huntâs Fraudulent Use of the CFTC Seal and Forged CFTC Memorandum

48. On May 9, 2018, L.M. asked Hunt for âlinks to CFTC tax regulations and
requirements,â explaining that he wished to learn about the tax for himself. (Compl. { 62.)

49. On May 10, 2018, Hunt emailed L.M. a PDF document, which Hunt stated was
âthe Liquidation Guideline concerning your Tax Obligation as prescribed by CFTC.â (Compl.
{| 63.)

50. The PDF document consisted of a three-page memorandum addressed to
âINVESTMENT BROKERAGES/ TRADERS,â purportedly from CFTC General Counsel
Daniel J. Davis, dated March 10, 2018, with the subject âGuidance Regarding Ethics Law and
Regulations Related to Tax Obligations/ Liquidation in Cryptocurrencies Portfolios.â (Compl.
{| 64.)

51. Under the heading âLiquidation Guidelines and Tax Obligations Of The Investing
Party,â the final section of the document stated:

A Portfolio with Crytpocurrencies [sic] with leverage outside the Jurisdiction of
CFTC incures [sic] a tax obligation of 10% at Liquidation.

Compliance with the aforementioned rule, shall be communincated [sic] to the
Investment Brokerage/ Trader who shall in turn liquidate the portfolio after an

authorization from the Tax Regulatory Unit.

Tax evasion at Liquidation is treated as a felony and in the event of such, the
penalties specified by the Commodities Exchange Act prevails [sic].

11
Case 4:18-cv-00807-O Document 17 Filed 06/28/19 Page 12o0f37 PagelD 295

Failure to liquidate by after [sic] the pre-requisites, stipulated above have been
complied with by the Investing Party, is an [sic] shall be treated as a felony which
in turn, has the implications as prescribed by the Commodities Exchange Act [sic]
on the Investment Brokerage/ Trader[. |

(Compl. { 65.)

52. The document was printed on CFTC letterhead, including the official CFTC seal.
(Compl. { 66.)

53. As Hunt knew when he sent it to L.M., the document was a forgery intended to
deceive L.M. into believing that he would have to pay a tax to the CFTC before withdrawing his
funds. (Compl. { 67.)

54. The portion of the document quoted in paragraph 51 above was not written by the
CFTCâs General Counsel or any other CFTC official, but instead was fabricated by Defendants
or someone acting in concert with Defendants for the purpose of deceiving customers such as
L.M. (Compl. { 68.)

55. The remainder of the document appeared to have been copied from a genuine
memorandum from the CFTCâs General Counsel to âALL STAFF,â dated February 5, 2018,
entitled âGuidance Regarding Ethics Law and Regulations Related to Employee Holdings and
Transactions in Cryptocurrencies,â which was publicly available on the CFTCâs website at
https://www.cftc.gov/sites/default/files/idc/groups/public/%40newsroom/documents/file/bitcoin_
egrelrrehtc020418.pdf. (Compl. { 69.)

56. L.M. noted to Hunt that the document was unclear as to several details concerning
the payment of the purported tax, and told Hunt that L.M. might contact the CFTC to seek
authorization before taking any steps to pay the tax. (Compl. { 70.)

57. Hunt dissuaded L.M. from doing so, and within days began pressuring L.M. to

come up with thousands of dollars to purchase Bitcoins and transfer them to a wallet address

12
Case 4:18-cv-00807-O Document 17 Filed 06/28/19 Page 13 0f37 PagelD 296

provided by Hunt to pay the purported tax. In order to induce L.M. to transfer the Bitcoins, Hunt
even offered to contribute $3,000 of his own funds to help pay the tax if L.M. provided another
$3,000. L.M. did not agree, because, as he told Hunt, even $1,000 âwould clean me out except
for my normal living expenses.â (Compl. J 71.)

58. Hunt intended to induce L.M. to purchase Bitcoins and transfer them to an
address that he told L.M. was for a âsecure CFTC walletâ in order to pay the purported tax, but
instead was the address of a wallet controlled by Hunt or a person acting in concert with Hunt, so
that Hunt could misappropriate the funds. (Compl. J 72.)

59. _L.M. subsequently contacted the CFTC General Counselâs office and was
informed that the document Hunt had sent him was a forgery that had been partially copied from
the publicly available February 5 memo. (Compl. { 73.)

60. When L.M. confronted Hunt with this information on June 15, 2018, Hunt denied
having created the document and would not acknowledge that it was a forgery. Hunt continued
to refer to the âliquidation taxâ as if it were real, told L.M. that â[i]f you want to liquidate, then
we have to come up with the 10%,â offered to loan L.M. part of the money, and refused to
answer L.M.âs repeated questions about the basis for the requirement to make such a payment
upon liquidation. (Compl. { 74.)

61. L.M. then demanded to withdraw $20,000 worth of Bitcoins from his account.
Hunt refused. To date, L.M. has not received any funds back from Hunt, and he has lost
approximately $3,941.35 (i.e., his entire principal investment). (Compl. J 75; Decl. of Trevor

Kokal (âKokal Decl.â) Â§ 6(b), (d) (ECF No. 16-1).)

G. Solicitation and Transfer of D.P.âs Bitcoins to Hecroft

62. Hecroft set up an email address, kimhecroft@ gmail.com, on or about January 3,
2017. (Compl. { 76.)

63. During the Relevant Period, Hecroft used some of the same IP addresses to log
into his kimhecroft@ gmail.com account that Hunt used when logging into his
morganhunttrusts @ gmail.com account and his âMorgan Huntâ Facebook page. (Compl. Â§ 77.)

64. By no later than 2017, Hecroft had also created a Facebook profile under the
name âKim Hecroft.â (Compl. { 78.)

65. In approximately 2017, Hecroft sent a Facebook friend request to a resident of
Australia, D.P., with whom he shared several mutual Facebook friends, and D.P. and Hecroft
began corresponding through Facebook chat. (Compl. J 79.)

66. Hecroft referred D.P. to the website of a purported investment firm by the name
of First Options Trading (âFirst Optionsâ), at http://firstoptionstrading.com, for which Hecroft
claimed to be a trader. (Compl. { 80.)

67. The website stated that First Options was located in Washington, D.C., at the
same street address as appeared on the phony âDiamonds Trading Investment Houseâ account
statements that Hunt sent to L.M. (Compl. J 81.)

68. Using Facebook chat, Hecroft solicited D.P. to open an account with First
Options, offering one of the investment opportunities described on the First Options website.
The offer was for D.P. to invest $1,000 worth of Bitcoin in a trading account that would pay

$100 dividends to D.P. each week. (Compl. J 82.)

Case 4:18-cv-00807-O Document 17 Filed 06/28/19 Page 15o0f37 PagelD 298

69. â_ Hecroft told D.P. that this would be a segregated investment account in D.P.âs
name, and that Hecroft would generate the promised returns by using the funds in the account to
trade binary options for D.P.âs benefit. (Compl. J 83.)

70. A binary option is a type of options contract in which the payout depends entirely
on the outcome of a yes/no proposition, typically relating to whether the price of a particular
asset that underlies the binary option will rise above or fall below a specified amount. Unlike
other types of options, a binary option does not give the holder the right to purchase or sell the
underlying asset. When the binary option expires, the option holder will receive either a pre-
determined amount of cash or nothing at all. (Compl. J 84.)

71. On or about May 9, 2018, D.P. registered as a customer on the First Options
website, and on or about May 10, 2018, she used CoinSpot, an Australian cryptocurrency
exchange, to transfer approximately $1,000 worth of Bitcoin from her own wallet to a wallet
address provided by Hecroft. (Compl. J 85.)

72. Between approximately May 19, 2018 and July 7, 2018, D.P. received online
account statements on the First Options website purportedly showing that Hecroft was profitably
trading binary options with D.P.âs $1,000 investment, and D.P. received in her wallet eight
transfers of Bitcoin worth approximately $100 eachâthe promised weekly dividend payments
purportedly generated by Hecroftâs profitable trading. (Compl. J 86.)

H. Hecroftâs Misrepresentations and Forgeries To Further His Fraud

73. On or about May 22, 2018, Hecroft began communicating with D.P. exclusively
though his kimhecroft @ gmail.com email, claiming in an email to D.P. that Hecroft had to
remove his Facebook account because of âan intrusion due to a suspected malware which

infected my device.â (Compl. J 87.)

15
Case 4:18-cv-00807-O Document 17 Filed 06/28/19 Page 16 o0f37 PagelD 299

T4. On or about that date, Hecroft solicited D.P. to invest more of her money with
him, through another investment opportunity described on the First Options website as the
âDiamond Trading Programme (Limited Time Only).â The website stated, in part:

We buy and sell diamonds on the international diamond exchange. Before the
internet, diamond trading was not easy, but now with bitcoins, we can trade

diamonds easily.

With an investment of 2 bitcoins, you will earn 10 bitcoins after 14 days from
diamond trading. 5 bitcoins will earn 25 bitcoins in the same period.

The earning trend of diamonds is such that profits can be made quickly.

Diamonds have an 85% of going up in price [sic] once purchased. Once they are
purchased, they are kept under a hold-order until their value increases, then they
are sold again and the funds are used to reinvest and resell. Because of the ease of
business of bitcoin transactions and the facilitated trading channels, so many
diamond trading transactions can be carried out on one trading account in a day.

Once the investor invests, the trader finds good diamond trades to participate in
and make profits for the client. In a few trades, huge profits are made.

(Compl. { 88.)

75. Hecroft confirmed to D.P. the terms stated on the website, telling her that First
Options achieved such massive returns by using the âbest trading strategies,â including âhedging,
Value Averaging, Fibonacci,â and told her that, two weeks after making a principal investment
of two Bitcoins, she would have ten Bitcoins in her account, out of which she would have to pay
a one Bitcoin feeâwhich would be a net 350 percent return on her investment in two weeks.
(Compl. { 89.)

76. Hecroft referred D.P. to the Facebook profiles of three individuals he claimed
were customers that could vouch for the investment opportunity. One of the supposed
customers, who used a Facebook profile with the name âEvamarie Folleyâ (hereinafter âFolleyâ),
had posted, and repeatedly âlikedâ Huntâs posts, on the âMorgan Huntâ Facebook profile page.

(Compl. { 90.)

16
Case 4:18-cv-00807-O Document 17 Filed 06/28/19 Page 17 of 37 PagelD 300

77. â Folley contacted D.P. by Facebook chat, telling her: âKim was my investment
portfolio manager heâs reliable and managed my Diamonds portfolio wherein in [sic] invested 2
BTC and got a return of 9 BTC as I had to pay a commission which was 1 BTC and was
deducted from the profits. Withdrawal policy is easy as the funds are remitted directly to your
bitcoins wallet on the completion of the 14 day trading cycle.â (Compl. J 91.)

78. Folley is either an associate of or another alias for Hecroft, not a real customer.
(Compl. { 92.)

79.  Hecroft pressured D.P. to make her diamond trading investment quickly: âThe
Diamonds Investments Plan is an NFP Diamonds trading scheme which is best suited on
Fridayâs, so this weekâs Friday is a perfect time for that [sic]. NFPâs Diamonds are the most
outstanding investments which guarantees high markets makeover [sic].â (Compl. { 93.)

80. On or about May 23, 2018, after D.P. reported back to Hecroft that the three
customers he referred had all been helpful, Hecroft again pressured D.P. to make her two Bitcoin
investment before the âweekend deadline,â and told her again the next day to transfer Bitcoins
immediately âso that a slot will be reserved for you.â (Compl. J 94.)

81. D.P. became nervous and asked Hecroft for proof of identification to verify his
and First Optionsâ legitimacy. (Compl. J 95.)

82. On or about May 24, 2018, Hecroft emailed D.P. two documents that he claimed
were âthe company trading licenseâ and âmy I.D card [sic],â and also provided what he said was
his phone number. (Compl. { 96.)

83. One document Hecroft sent was a photograph apparently showing six copies of a

purported California driverâs license in the name of Kim Hecroft, showing his birth date as May

17
Case 4:18-cv-00807-O Document 17 Filed 06/28/19 Page 18o0f37 PagelD 301

15, 1976. The document was fake and did not show a valid form of identification for Hecroft.
(Compl. { 97.)

84. The other document was an image of a certificate, dated May 24, 2016, stating
that âFirst Options Tradingâ had completed an âexamination and training administered by
Blockchain Councilâ to become a âCertified CryptoCurrency Expert.â The certificate was
purportedly signed by Toshendra Sharma, identified as Executive Director of Blockchain
Council. (Compl. { 98.)

85. | The Blockchain Council is, according to its website, âan authoritative group of
experts and enthusiasts who are evangelizing the Blockchain Research, Development, Use Cases,
Products and Knowledge for the better world [sic],â and has no role in licensing individuals or
firms to trade any product. The purported certificate Hecroft sent D.P. was thus not a âtrading
licenseâ for First Options and was fake and did not reflect anyone actually having completed an
âexamination and training administered by Blockchain Councilâ (an organization of which
Toshendra Sharma has never served as âExecutive Directorâ). (Compl. J 99.)

86. D.P. used CoinSpot to transfer approximately two Bitcoins (worth approximately
$15,000 at the time) to Hecroft to invest in the diamond trading investment offer. (Compl.

q 100.)

87. On or about May 25, 2018, Hecroft confirmed to D.P. that he had received the
funds, stating: âYour portfolio has been set up and trading will commence immediately,
meantime you'll also be receiving payouts today on your former portfolio [sic].â (Compl.

q 101.)
88. On or about May 26, 2018, in response to D.P. informing Hecroft that she had

informed a friend about the binary options trading investment opportunity (in which D.P. had

18
Case 4:18-cv-00807-O Document 17 Filed 06/28/19 Page 19 of 37 PagelD 302

invested $1,000), Hecroft encouraged D.P. to recruit her friend to invest, stating that the friendâs
participation âwould expand your earnings in referral commissions,â and assuring D.P. that
âFirstOptions is based and regulated in the Us [sic],â that binary options are âstrictly regulated
by various bodies like SEC, CFTC, [and] Blockchain Council,â and that âFirstOptions is
regulated by the aforementioned bodies including Blockchain Council.â These statements were
knowingly false because, among other things, as noted above, Blockchain Council is not a
regulator of binary options or anything else. (Compl. J 102.)

89. On or about June 11, 2018, Hecroft represented to D.P. that her funds had been so
profitably traded that she had approximately ten Bitcoins in her First Options account. (Compl.
q 103.)

90. Hecroft was not engaged in any profitable binary options or diamond trading
activity during the Relevant Period, and was not involved in any legitimate trading business
under the name First Options or otherwise. (Compl. { 104.)

I. Hecroftâs Fraudulent Use of the CFTC Seal and Forged CFTC Memoranda

91. On or about June 11, 2018, D.P. inquired with Hecroft about the procedure for
withdrawing funds from her First Options account. In response, Hecroft sent D.P. an email and
PDF attachment purporting to require D.P. to transfer funds to the CFTC prior to liquidating her
account. (Compl. { 105.)

92. The attachment consisted of a three-page memorandum substantially identical to
the forged document that Hunt sent to L.M.âand had the same document âAuthorâ in the PDF
metadataâexcept that the attachment Hecroft sent D.P. was dated June 6, 2018; purported to
apply to portfolios âabove 5BTCâ only; and provided a specific âapproved CFTC walletâ

address to which investors were instructed to send their tax payment. (Compl. { 106.)

19
Case 4:18-cv-00807-O Document 17 Filed 06/28/19 Page 20 of 37 PagelD 303

93. Just as Hunt did in his communications with L.M., Hecroft told D.P. that the
CFTC tax had âto be paid separately by the investor prior to liquidationââ1.e., could not be paid
out of D.P.âs First Options account balance. (Compl. { 107.)

94. â_ Although the attachment referred to a âtax obligationâ to the CFTC, Hecroftâs
email portrayed the payment to the CFTC as taking the place of the one Bitcoin fee that Hecroft
had previously disclosed to D.P.: âWithdrawal is made within 24 hours after liquidation protocol
is complied with, as recently, there was a shift in withdrawal policy whereby investors who
operate portfolios above 5 BTC are to remit their commissions to a CFTC designated wallet,
prior to liquidation, in this case which is | BTC. When this has been complied with, then CFTC
notifies the Investment brokerage within 24 hours of such compliance, who in turn liquidates at
the point of reception of that notice. Enclosed is the CFTC memo on the new policy and the
compliance procedure.â (Compl. J 108.)

95. The attachment was printed on CFTC letterhead, including the official CFTC seal.
(Compl. { 109.)

96. As Hecroft knew when he sent it to D.P., the document was a forgery intended to
deceive D.P. into believing that she would have to pay a tax to the CFTC before withdrawing her
funds. (Compl. { 110.)

97. The portion of the document concerning a tax payable to the CFTC was not
written by the CFTCâs General Counsel or any other CFTC official, but instead was fabricated
by Defendants or someone acting in concert with Defendants for the purpose of deceiving
customers such as D.P. (Compl. { 111.)

98. In reliance on the attachment sent by Hecroft, on or about June 12, 2018, D.P.

transferred approximately one Bitcoin (equivalent to approximately ten percent of her purported

20
Case 4:18-cv-00807-O Document 17 Filed 06/28/19 Page 21 0f37 PagelD 304

account balance in respect of her diamond trading investment) to the wallet address provided in
the document. That address was not for a wallet associated with the CFTC, but instead was for a
wallet controlled by Hecroft or someone acting in concert with Hecroft. (Compl. { 112.)

99. Hecroft subsequently induced D.P. not to fully liquidate her accountâwhich
purportedly contained tens of thousands of dollarsâ worth of Bitcoinsâby offering her the
opportunity to invest another two Bitcoins in diamond trading, on the same terms as she had
previously done, and telling her that favorable tax treatment would result if she withdrew only
$3,000 worth of Bitcoins from her account. (Compl. J 113.)

100. On or about June 13, 2018, Hecroft, using the wallet address purportedly
controlled by the CFTC, transferred approximately $3,000 worth of Bitcoins to D.P., and told
D.P. that a second diamond trading portfolio was being set up for D.P., inducing D.P. to transfer
another one Bitcoin to Hecroftâat that time worth approximately $6,500. (Compl. { 114.)

101.  Onor about June 28, 2018, when D.P. requested to withdraw funds from her First
Options account in respect of her second diamond trading portfolio, Hecroft induced D.P. to
make an additional one Bitcoin payment purportedly to the CFTC, by transferring approximately
$2,500 worth of Bitcoin to D.P. as a personal loan from Hecroft. (Compl. J 115.)

102. Onor about July 1, 2018, Hecroft informed D.P. that the CFTC had still not
received D.P.âs June 28, 2018 payment of one Bitcoin. (Compl. J 116.)

103. Hecroft then sent D.P. fake correspondence between First Options and the CFTC
purporting to document a supposed dispute over D.P.âs attempts to pay the CFTC tax. (Compl.
q 117.)

104. Hecroft sent D.P. a PDF document containing a letter dated July 3, 2018,

addressed to the CFTC General Counselâs office, on the letterhead of âFirst Options Bitcoin

21
Case 4:18-cv-00807-O Document 17 Filed 06/28/19 Page 22 of 37 PagelD 305

Investment Management,â signed by Hecroft as âInvestment Portfolio Manager/Fund Manager,â
asking the CFTC to âconfirm reception [sic]â of D.P.âs June 29 payment to the CFTCâs wallet
address. No such letter was actually sent by Hecroft to the CFTC. (Compl. J 118.)

105. Hecroft then sent D.P. another PDF document containing a memorandum from
the CFTC General Counsel to First Options, dated July 6, 2018, purporting to respond to
Hecroftâs July 3 letter, and stating that the issue was âbeing resolved by the CFTC Appeals
complaints [sic]â and promising to resolve the issue âwithin 30 working days.â (Compl. { 119.)

106. This document was printed on CFTC letterhead, including the official CFTC seal.
(Compl. { 120.)

107. As Hecroft knew when he sent it to D.P., the document was a forgery, and was
not written by the CFTCâs General Counsel or any other CFTC official, but instead was
fabricated by Defendants or someone acting in concert with Defendants for the purpose of
deceiving D.P. and preventing her from discovering Hecroftâs fraudulent scheme. (Compl.

q 121.)

108. When D.P. told Hecroft that she needed access to her account funds to pay
medical bills and that she had no available funds left, and suggested that she would contact the
CFTC directly, Hecroft continued in his attempts to defraud D.P. of more funds, by arranging, on
or about July 11-12, 2018, for D.P. to receive transfers of Bitcoins worth approximately $4,500,
purportedly in respect of a $3,000 loan from Folley and an additional $1,500 loan from Hecroft.
On or about July 12, 2018, D.P. transferred an additional one Bitcoin to a wallet address
provided by Hecroft. (Compl. J 122.)

109. Onor about July 19, 2018, Hecroft sent D.P. another fake First Options letter

addressed to the CFTC General Counselâs office, dated July 18, 2018, this time purportedly

22
Case 4:18-cv-00807-O Document 17 Filed 06/28/19 Page 23 of 37 PagelD 306

written by âSteven McGill,â âLiquidation Officerâ for âFirs Options Investment [sic]ââi.e., a
person with the same name as the purported âLiquidation Officerâ for Huntâs âDiamonds
Trading Investment House.â The letter, though purportedly addressed to the CFTC, directly
addressed D.P. (e.g., referring to her investment portfolio as âyour portfolioâ) and stated that
Hecroft had committed âprofessional misconductâ by misappropriating $1,500 from another
customer for D.P.âs benefit. No such letter was actually sent to the CFTC. (Compl. J 123.)
110. Onor about July 19, 2018, D.P. forwarded to Hecroft an email from the CFTC

Office of Customer Outreach and Education confirming that the CFTC does not accept tax
payments. Hecroft still refused to acknowledge that his repeated demands for transfers of one
Bitcoin to the purported âCFTC walletâ had been fraudulent. Instead, similar to Huntâs reaction
when L.M. confronted him with the truth, Hecroft continued to insist, in an email on or about
July 22, 2018, that the âtaxâ was real:

In response to your curiosity regarding the tax issue on your Diamond Portfolio, it

is with note [sic] that the CFTC oversees all Pre-liquidation and also meddles

with investors funds which was meant for trading on designated contract markets

which is kept apart from the Futures Commissions Merchantâs (FCM) own funds.

Moreover, the CFTC Regulations, vests the CFTC with omnibus powers which
gives it leverage to exercise a large spectra of discretion during liquidation.

(Compl. { 124.)

111.  Onor about July 23, 2018, Hecroft transferred to D.P. approximately $1,000
worth of Bitcoinsâpurportedly to honor her request for the return of her original principal
investmentâinducing D.P. to then transfer approximately $1,500 worth of Bitcoins to Hecroft in
order to repay the funds Hecroft had supposedly misused according to the fake July 18 letter.

(Compl. J 125.)

23
Case 4:18-cv-00807-O Document 17 Filed 06/28/19 Page 24 o0f37 PagelD 307

112. Hecroft subsequently justified his refusal to permit D.P. to liquidate funds from
her accountâpurportedly hundreds of thousands of dollarsâ worth of Bitcoinsâby fabricating
documents concerning a purported dispute concerning the loan supposedly extended to D.P. by
Folley. (Compl. { 126.)

113. Of particular note, Hecroft sent D.P. a letter dated August 2, 2018, on the
letterhead of âFirst Options Bitcoin Investment Management,â purportedly written by Steven
McGill (again identified as âLiquidation Officerâ for âFirs Options Investment [sic]â), stating
that âEva Marieâ was demanding the return of her $3,000 loan, and indicating that D.P.âs
portfolio at First Options contained 25.11 Bitcoins. (Compl. Â§ 127.)

114. Onor about August 3, 2018, D.P. asked Hecroft for the return of seven Bitcoinsâ
i.e., two Bitcoins for the principal invested in each of her two diamond trading portfolios, and
one Bitcoin for each of her three purported tax payments to the CFTC. (Compl. { 128.)

115. Inresponse, Hecroft provided D.P. with letters from McGill, dated August 3,
2018, promising to refund 7.1 Bitcoins to D.P.âover $45,000âprovided that D.P. first
transferred $1,200 worth of Bitcoins to pay a âliquidation feeâ and subsequently repay $3,000 to
âFoley [sic]â and $1,500 to Hecroft. (Compl. { 129.)

116. Onor about August 4, 2018, D.P. transferred approximately $1,200 worth of
Bitcoins to a wallet address provided by Hecroft. When D.P. inquired about the status of her
refund, Hecroft sent D.P., on or about August 6, 2018, a series of JPG documents purporting to
show that Folley had filed a âComplaint and Request for Injunction,â dated August 6, 2018,
which, Hecroft claimed, prevented First Options from liquidating D.P.âs account until D.P.

repaid Folleyâs loan. (Compl. J 130.)

24
Case 4:18-cv-00807-O Document 17 Filed 06/28/19 Page 25 o0f37 PagelD 308

117. The âComplaint and Request for Injunctionâ reflected a pending action in the U.S.
District Court for the Western District of Washington captioned âEva-Marie Foley [sic] v. First
Options Investment Company LTD [sic],â with case number CV42108-18. No such lawsuit has
been filed in that Court. (Compl. J 131.)

118. Onor about August 9, 2018, Hecroft told D.P. that First Options had determined
to credit D.P. one Bitcoinâincreasing her account balance to 8.1 Bitcoins. (Compl. J 132.)

119. On or about August 22, 2018, Hecroft emailed D.P. again, stating that Folley
planned to bring another lawsuit, this time in D.P.âs âhome country.â (Compl. { 133.)

120. To date, D.P. has not been repaid any of the 8.1 Bitcoins purportedly credited to
her account with First Options, and she has suffered losses totaling approximately $32,047.79.
(Compl. { 134; Kokal Decl. J 6(c), (e).)

Hit. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
A. Jurisdiction and Venue

1. Section 6c(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(a) (2012), authorizes the Commission
to seek injunctive and other relief in United States district court against any person whenever it
shall appear to the Commission that such person has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage
in any act or practice constituting a violation of any provision of the Act, or any rule, regulation,
or order thereunder, and provides that district courts âshall have jurisdiction to entertain such
actions.â This Court also has jurisdiction over this case pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1331 (2012)
(federal question) and 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1345 (2012) (United States as Plaintiff).

2. Venue lies properly with this Court pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.

Â§ 13a-1(e) (2012), because Hunt transacted business in this District, and certain transactions,

25
Case 4:18-cv-00807-O Document 17 Filed 06/28/19 Page 26 of 37 PagelD 309

acts, practices, and courses of business described above occurred in this Districtânamely,
Huntâs use of a mailing address located in this District as part of his fraudulent scheme.

B. Hunt Committed Forex Fraud in Violation
of 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6b(a)(2)(A)-(C) and 17 C.F.R. Â§ 5.2(b)

3. Section 4b(a)(2)(A)-(C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6b(a)(2)(A)-(C) (2012), makes it
unlawful âfor any person, in or in connection with any order to make, or the making of, any
contract of sale of any commodity for future delivery, or swap, that is made, or to be made, for or
on behalf of, or with, any other person, other than on or subject to the rules of a designated
contract marketâ(A) to cheat or defraud or attempt to cheat or defraud the other person; (B)
willfully to make or cause to be made to the other person any false report or statement or
willfully to enter or cause to be entered for the other person any false record; [or] (C) willfully to
deceive or attempt to deceive the other person by any means whatsoever in regard to any order or
contract or the disposition or execution of any order or contract, or in regard to any act of agency
performed, with respect to any order or contract for or... with the other person.â This provision
applies to Huntâs purported foreign currency transactions âas ifâ they were contracts of sale of a
commodity for future delivery, pursuant to Section 2(c)(2)(C)(iv) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.

Â§ 2(c)(2)(C)av) (2012).

4. Regulation 5.2(b), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 5.2(b) (2018), provides that it shall be unlawful for
any person, by use of the mails or by any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce,
directly or indirectly, in or in connection with any retail forex transaction: (1) to cheat or defraud
or attempt to cheat or defraud any person; (2) willfully to make or cause to be made to any
person any false report or statement or cause to be entered for any person any false record; or (3)

willfully to deceive or attempt to deceive any person by any means whatsoever.

26
Case 4:18-cv-00807-O Document 17 Filed 06/28/19 Page 27 of37 PagelD 310

5. Hunt violated 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6b(a)(2)(A)-(C) and 17 C.F.R. Â§ 5.2(b) by, as set forth
above, cheating or defrauding or attempting to cheat or defraud customers, by willfully making
or causing to be made false statements to customers, and by willfully deceiving or attempting to
deceive customers, in connection with Huntâs offers to customers to enter into forex transactions.
Among other things, Hunt willfully (1) misrepresented to L.M. (who was not an eligible contract
participant) that his funds would be pooled and used to invest in, among other things, forex
contracts for the benefit of L.M; (2) misrepresented to potential customers and at least one actual
customer, L.M., that Hunt had lengthy experience as a professional portfolio manager and was
profitably trading forex contracts; (3) misrepresented to L.M. that Hunt was using his funds to
trade forex contracts and was doing so profitably, including by providing L.M. with fake account
statements; (4) misrepresented to L.M. that he could not withdraw any of his purported profits
from trading forex unless he first paid a tax to the CFTC, including by arranging for L.M. to
speak to a person impersonating a CFTC employee and providing L.M. with a fake CFTC
memorandum; and (5) misappropriated L.M.âs funds for unauthorized purposes rather than
investing the funds for L.M.âs benefit.

C, Hunt Committed CPO Fraud in Violation of 7 U.S.C. Â§ 60(1)

6. During the Relevant Period, Hunt acted as a commodity pool operator (âCPOâ),
as defined by Section la(11) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ la(11) (2012), in that he engaged in a
business that is of the nature of an investment trust, syndicate, or similar form of enterprise,
operated for the purpose of trading in commodity interests and, in connection therewith,
solicited, accepted, or received from others, funds, securities, or property (in the form of
Bitcoins), either directly or through capital contributions, the sale of stock or other forms of

part, leveraged off-exchange forex transactions offered to persons that are not eligible contract
participants, as described in Section 2(c)(2)(C)@) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(c)(2)(C)G) (2012).

7. Section 40(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 60(1) (2012), prohibits CPOs, whether
registered with the Commission or not, by use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of
interstate commerce, directly or indirectly, from employing devices, schemes, or artifices to
defraud any client or participant or prospective client or participant, or engaging in transactions,
practices, or courses of business which operate as a fraud or deceit upon any client or participant
or prospective client or participant.

8. While acting in his capacity as a CPO and using the mails or other means or
instrumentality of interstate commerce (including Facebook and email), Hunt knowingly or
recklessly (1) misrepresented to L.M. (who was not an eligible contract participant) that his
funds would be pooled and used to invest in, among other things, forex contracts for the benefit
of L.M.; (2) misrepresented to potential customers and at least one actual customer, L.M., that
Hunt had lengthy experience as a professional portfolio manager and was profitably trading
forex contracts; (3) misrepresented to L.M. that Hunt was using his funds to trade forex contracts
and was doing so profitably, including by providing L.M. with fake account statements; (4)
misrepresented to L.M. that he could not withdraw any of his purported profits from trading
forex unless he first paid a tax to the CFTC, including by arranging for L.M. to speak to a person
impersonating a CFTC employee and providing L.M. with a fake CFTC memorandum; and (5)
misappropriated L.M.âs funds for unauthorized purposes rather than investing the funds for

L.M.âs benefit. Therefore, Hunt violated 7 U.S.C. Â§ 60(1).

D. Defendants Committed Fraud by Deceptive Device or Contrivance
in Violation of 7 U.S.C. Â§ 9(1) and 17 C.F.R. Â§ 180.1(a)

9. Section 6(c)(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 9(1) (2012), makes it unlawful for any
person, directly or indirectly, to âuse or employ, or attempt to use or employ, in connection with
any swap, or a contract of sale of any commodity in interstate commerce, or for future delivery
on or subject to the rules of any registered entity, any manipulative or deceptive device or
contrivance, in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Commission shall promulgate
by not later than 1 year afterâ July 21, 2010, the date of enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street
Reform and Consumer Protection Act.

10. Section 1a(47)(A) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1a(47)(A) (2012), defines âswapâ to
include, among other things, any agreement, contract, or transaction that: (a) is an option of any
kind; (b) provides for payment dependent on the occurrence, nonoccurrence, or the extent of the
occurrence of an event or contingency; or (c) provides on an executory basis for payments based
on the value or level of one or more interest or other rates, currencies, commodities, securities,
instruments of indebtedness, indices, quantitative measures, or other financial or economic
interests or property of any kind, without also conveying an ownership interest in any asset or
liability.

11. Section 2(c)(2)(C)Gi)(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.Â§ 2(c)(2)(C)Gp() (2012), makes
7 U.S.C. Â§ 9(1) applicable to retail forex transactions.

12. Regulation 180.1(a), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 180.1(a) (2018), provides, in part:

It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, in connection with any
swap, or contract of sale of any commodity in interstate commerce, or contract for

future delivery on or subject to the rules of any registered entity, to intentionally
or recklessly:

(1) Use or employ, or attempt to use or employ, any manipulative device, scheme,
or artifice to defraud;

29
Case 4:18-cv-00807-O Document 17 Filed 06/28/19 Page 30 o0f37 PagelD 313

(2) Make, or attempt to make, any untrue or misleading statement of a material
fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements
made not untrue or misleading; [or]

(3) Engage, or attempt to engage, in any act, practice, or course of business,
which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person....

13. Defendants, in connection with swaps (1.e., binary options), forex, and other
contracts of sale of commodities in interstate commerce (e.g., diamonds), willfully, intentionally,
or recklessly (1) misrepresented to customers that their funds would be used to invest in trading
for the customersâ benefit; (2) misrepresented to customers their experience and track record as
traders and portfolio managers; (3) misrepresented that they were using customer funds to trade
and were doing so profitably, including by providing customers with fake account statements;
(4) misrepresented to customers that they could not withdraw any of their purported investment
profits unless they first paid a tax to the CFTC; and (5) misappropriated customer funds for
unauthorized purposes rather than investing the funds for the customersâ benefit. Therefore,
Defendants violated 7 U.S.C. Â§ 9(1) and 17 C.F.R. Â§ 180.1(a).

V. RESTITUTION AND CIVIL MONETARY PENALTY
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED THAT:
A. Restitution

1. Pursuant to Section 6c(d)(3)(A) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(d)(3)(A) (2012),
Hunt shall pay restitution in the amount of three thousand nine hundred forty-one dollars and
thirty-five cents ($3,941.35), and Hecroft shall pay restitution in the amount of thirty-two
thousand forty-seven dollars and seventy-nine cents ($32,047.79) (the âRestitution Obligationsâ),
plus post-judgment interest, within ten (10) days of the date of the entry of this Order and
Default Judgment (this âOrderâ). Post-judgment interest shall accrue on the Restitution
Obligations beginning on the date of entry of this Order and shall be determined by using the
Treasury Bill rate prevailing on the date of entry of this Order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1961.

2. To effect payment of the Restitution Obligations and the distribution of any
restitution payments to Defendantsâ customers, the Court appoints the National Futures
Association (âNFAâ) as Monitor (âMonitorâ). The Monitor shall collect restitution payments
from Defendants and make distributions as set forth below. Because the Monitor is acting as an
officer of this Court in performing these services, NFA shall not be liable for any action or
inaction arising from NFAâs appointment as Monitor, other than actions involving fraud.

3. Hunt shall make Restitution Obligation payments under this Order to the Monitor
in the name âMorgan Hunt â Restitution Fund.â Hecroft shall make Restitution Obligation
payments under this Order to the Monitor in the name âKim Hecroft â Restitution Fund.â
Defendants shall send such Restitution Obligation payments by electronic funds transfer, or by
U.S. postal money order, certified check, bank cashierâs check, or bank money order, to the

Office of Administration, National Futures Association, 300 South Riverside Plaza, Suite 1800,

32
Case 4:18-cv-00807-O Document 17 Filed 06/28/19 Page 33 0f37 PagelD 316

Chicago, Illinois 60606 under cover letter that identifies the paying Defendant and the name and
docket number of this proceeding. Defendants shall simultaneously transmit copies of the cover
letter and the form of payment to the Chief Financial Officer, Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20581.

4. The Monitor shall oversee the Restitution Obligation and shall have the discretion
to determine the manner of distribution of such funds in an equitable fashion to Defendantsâ
customers identified by the Commission or may defer distribution until such time as the Monitor
deems appropriate. In the event that the amount of Restitution Obligation payments to the
Monitor are of a de minimis nature such that the Monitor determines that the administrative cost
of making a distribution to eligible customers is impractical, the Monitor may, in its discretion,
treat such restitution payments as civil monetary penalty payments, which the Monitor shall
forward to the Commission following the instructions for civil monetary penalty payments set
forth in Part B below.

5. Defendants shall cooperate with the Monitor as appropriate to provide such
information as the Monitor deems necessary and appropriate to identify Defendantsâ customers
to whom the Monitor, in its sole discretion, may determine to include in any plan for distribution
of any Restitution Obligation payments. Defendants shall execute any documents necessary to
release funds that they have in any repository, bank, investment, or other financial institution,
wherever located, in order to make partial or total payment toward the Restitution Obligation.

6. The Monitor shall provide the Commission at the beginning of each calendar year
with a report detailing the disbursement of funds to Defendantsâ customers during the previous

year. The Monitor shall transmit this report under a cover letter that identifies the name and

33
Case 4:18-cv-00807-O Document 17 Filed 06/28/19 Page 34o0f37 PagelD 317

docket number of this proceeding to the Chief Financial Officer, Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20581.

7. The amounts payable to each customer shall not limit the ability of any customer
from proving that a greater amount is owed from Defendants or any other person or entity, and
nothing herein shall be construed in any way to limit or abridge the rights of any customer that
exist under state or common law.

8. Pursuant to FRCP 71, each customer of Defendants who suffered a loss is
explicitly made an intended third-party beneficiary of this Order and may seek to enforce
obedience of this Order to obtain satisfaction of any portion of the restitution that has not been
paid by Defendants to ensure continued compliance with any provision of this Order and to hold
Defendants in contempt for any violations of any provision of this Order.

9. To the extent that any funds accrue to the U.S. Treasury for satisfaction of
Defendantsâ Restitution Obligation, such funds shall be transferred to the Monitor for
disbursement in accordance with the procedures set forth above.

B. Civil Monetary Penalty

10. Pursuant to Section 6c(d)(1)(A) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(d)(1)(A) (2012),
Hunt shall pay a civil monetary penalty in the amount of one hundred eighty thousand dollars
($180,000), and Hecroft shall pay a civil monetary penalty in the amount of one hundred eighty
thousand dollars ($180,000), i.e., $360,000 total (the âCMP Obligationsâ). Defendants shall pay
the CMP Obligations within ten (10) days of the date of the entry of this Order. If the CMP
Obligations are not paid in full within ten (10) days of the date of entry of this Order, then post-
judgment interest shall accrue on the CMP Obligations beginning on the date of entry of this

Order and shall be determined by using the Treasury Bill rate prevailing on the date of entry of

34
Case 4:18-cv-00807-O Document 17 Filed 06/28/19 Page 350f37 PagelD 318

this Order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1961. Defendants shall pay their CMP Obligations by
electronic funds transfer, U.S. postal money order, certified check, bank cashierâs check, or bank
money order. If payment is to be made other than by electronic funds transfer, then the payment
shall be made payable to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and sent to the address
below:
