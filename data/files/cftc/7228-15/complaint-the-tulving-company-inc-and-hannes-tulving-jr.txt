I.
INTRODUCTION
l. From in or about August 2013 through in or about January 2014 (âRelevant

Periodâ), Hannes Tulving, Jr. (âTulvingâ), through his company, The Tulving Company, Inc.
(âTulving Companyâ) engaged in a fraudulent scheme to obtain funds from the public and
misappropriate those funds. As part of their scheme, Tulving and Tulving Company fraudulently
offered contracts of sale of commodities in interstate commerce; namely, contracts for the sale of
gold, silver, platinum, and palladium bullion and coin (âprectous metalsâ).

2. During the Relevant Period, Defendants obtained at least $17.8 million from at
least 381 customers located throughout the United States for the purchase and sale of precious
metals. Defendants purchased and sold little or no precious metals with the funds they collected
from customers. Instead, Defendants defrauded investors by lying to them and misappropriating

their funds.

precious metals when, in fact, they did not; (2) investors holdings in precious metals had
significant value when, in fact, the non-existent holdings had no value whatsoever; and (3)
investors were realizing profits from their investments when, in fact, no profit whatsoever had
been realized.

OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT

A. Defendants Offered Contracts of Sale of Commodities in Interstate Commerce

13. During the Relevant Period, Tulving, by and through Tulving Company, obtained
at least $17.8 million from customers for the purpose of entering into contracts of sale of gold,
silver, platinum, and palladium in interstate commerce.

14. Under Section 1(a)(9) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1(a)(9) (2012), gold, silver,
platinum, and palladium are statutorily-defined commodities.

15. As part of their fraud, Defendants used the mails or other instrumentalities of
interstate commerce to: (1) receive funds from and send funds to customers; (2) disseminate false
account documents to customers; and (3) send fictitious purchase and sale documents to
customers.

B. Defendants Fraudulently Solicited Customers by Making False and Misleading

Representations and/or Omitting Material Facts

16. | During the Relevant Period, Defendants represented to members of the public that
Tulving Company was a highly reputable precious metals firm that delivered precious metals to
customers. Tulving Company held itself out as a stable, established dealer in precious metals
through its website, www.tulving.com (âwebsiteâ). The website stated that, from 1999 through
March 30, 2013, Tulving Company bought and sold in excess of $2.1 billion in precious metals.
The website also represented that Tulving Company sold more than $350 million in precious

metals during 2012.

4

Case 3:15-cv-00424 Document1 Filed 09/11/15 Page 4 of 13
17. During the Relevant Period, the website represented Tulving Company purchased
and sold precious metals at particular prices. The website also stated that precious metals were
shipped quickly to customers after placement of orders and receipt of customer funds.
Specifically, the website represented: âGold, Platinum, and Palladium are typically shipped
within 72 working hours of receipt of your wire;â â[s]ilver is typically shipped within about 5
working days after receipt of your wire;â and items paid by check would be shipped within 14
working days. These representations were false.

18. The website provided instructions for customers to purchase metals by sending
funds to Tulving Company. Customers were instructed to send a check by mail to the address of
Tulving Company or wire funds to bank accounts in the name of Tulving Company. During the
Relevant Period, Defendants received at least $17.8 million for the purpose of purchasing and
selling precious metals.

19. During the Relevant Period, at least 381 persons from locations throughout the
United States, including North Carolina, submitted orders with Tulving Company for the
purchase of precious metals. During this time, Tulving, by and through Tulving Company,
received approximately $17.8 million from mai! and wire transfers from these persons to
purchase precious metals from Tulving Company.

20. During the Relevant Period, Defendants misrepresented confirmation of purchase
and sale transactions with Tulving Company customers. Defendants falsely represented to
customers that precious metals had been purchased after receipt of customer funds and that
precious metals had been shipped to customers. Defendants knew that their representations
regarding the purchase of precious metals were false because they did not purchase precious

metals on behalf of customers and misappropriated most, if not all, of the customer funds.

5

Case 3:15-cv-00424 Document1 Filed 09/11/15 Page 5 of 13
21. During the Relevant Period, Defendants failed to disclose, and omitted, that they
never purchased any precious metals on behalf of Tulving customers. Defendants also failed to
disclose, and omitted, that the Tulving customer funds would be misappropriated by Defendants
for purposes unrelated to the purchase and sale of precious metals including, but not limited to,

paying the personal expenses of Defendants.

C. Defendants Misrepresented Account Values and Profits

22. During the Relevant Period, Defendants issued false financial statements to
customers. These statements: (1) misrepresented that Tulving Company customers owned
specific amounts of precious metals; (2) misstated the value of Tulving customer precious metals
purchases; (3) and falsely represented the profitability of Tulving customer purchases.

23. | Contrary to Defendantsâ false financial statements, none of the Tulving customers
actually owned any precious metals, let alone realized any profits from their precious metals
purchases because Defendants never actually purchased precious metals. Further, Defendants
financial statements failed to disclose, and omitted, that the funds from the Tulving Customers

would be misappropriated by Defendants.

D. Defendants Misappropriated Customer Funds

24. During the Relevant Period, Defendants misappropriated approximately $17.8
million of customer funds for improper and unauthorized uses.

25. During the Relevant Period, Defendants misappropriated customer funds for
Defendantsâ own financial benefit and for purposes unrelated to the purchase and sale of

precious metals.

Tulving solicited investors on behalf of Tulving Company and handled all customer funds
received by Tulving Company. Tulving was the sole shareholder and president of Tulving
