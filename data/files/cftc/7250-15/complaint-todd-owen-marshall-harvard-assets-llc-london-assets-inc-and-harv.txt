retail commodity transactions.
Case 0:15-cv-62049-XXXX Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 09/28/2015 Page 2 of 27

2. Moreover, Harvard Assets, London Assets, and Harvard International, in
or in connection with these illegal off-exchange retail commodity transactions, accepted
money, securities, or property (or extended credit in lieu thereof) to margin, guarantee, or
secure trades or contracts that resulted or may have resulted therefrom, without
registering with the Commission as a futures commission merchant (âFCMâ).

3, By this conduct and the conduct further described herein, from on or
around July 16, 2011 to April 30, 2012 or later (the âFirst Relevant Periodâ), Harvard
International and Marshall have engaged in conduct in violation of Section 4(a) of the
Commodity Exchange Act, as amended (the âActâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6(a) (2012), and Harvard
International has engaged in conduct in violation of Section 4d(a)(1), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6d(a)(1)
(2012), and are each directly liable for this conduct.

4, By this conduct and the conduct further described herein, from on or
around September 6, 2012 or earlier to March 5, 2013 or later (the âSecond Relevant
Periodâ), Harvard Assets, London Assets, and Marshall have engaged in conduct in
violation of Section 4(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6(a) (2012), and Harvard Assets and
London Assets have engaged in conduct in violation of Section 4d(a)(1), 7 U.S.C.

Â§ 6d(a)(1) (2012), and are each directly liable for this conduct.

5. The officers, employees, and/or agents of Harvard Assets, London Assets,
and Harvard International, including Marshall, committed the acts and omissions alleged
herein within the course and scope of their employment, agency, or office with Harvard
Assets, London Assets and Harvard International. Therefore, Harvard Assets, London
Assets, and Harvard International are liable, pursuant to Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7

U.S.C. Â§ 2(a)(1)(B) (2012), and Commission Regulation 1.2, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.2 (2014), as

principals for the violative acts and omissions of the employees and/or agents of Harvard
Assets, London Assets, and Harvard International, including Marshall.

6. During the First Relevant Period, Marshall controlled Harvard
International, and did not act in good faith or knowingly induced Harvard Internationalâs
violations of the Act. Therefore, Marshall is liable for Harvard Internationalâs violations
of Sections 4(a) and 4d(a)(1) of the Act, as a controlling person pursuant to Section 13(b)
of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13c(b) (2012).

7. During the Second Relevant Period, Marshall controlled Harvard Assets
and London Assets, and did not act in good faith or knowingly induced Harvard Assetsâ
and London Assetsâ violations of the Act. Therefore, Marshall is liable for Harvard
Assetsâ and London Assetsâ violations of Sections 4(a) and 4d(a)(1) of the Act, as a
controlling person pursuant to Section 13(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13c(b) (2012).

8. Accordingly, pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2012),
the CFTC brings this action to enjoin Defendantsâ unlawful acts and practices, to compel
their compliance with the Act, and to further enjoin them from engaging in any
commodity-related activity, as set forth below.

9, In addition, the CFTC seeks civil monetary penalties and remedial
ancillary relief, including, but not limited to, trading and registration bans, restitution,
disgorgement, rescission, post-judgment interest, and such other relief as the Court may
deem necessary and appropriate.

10. Unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, Defendants likely will

continue to engage in the acts and practices alleged in this Complaint or similar acts and

practices, as more fully described below.

Commission that such person has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in any act
or practice constituting a violation of the Act or any rule, regulation, or order thereunder.

12. | The Commission has jurisdiction over the conduct and transactions at
issue in this case pursuant to Section 2(c)(2)(D) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(c)(2)(D) (2012).

13. Venue properly lies with this Court pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act,
7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(e) (2012), because Defendants reside in this District, Defendants
transacted business in this District, and certain transactions, acts, and practices alleged in
this Complaint occurred, are occurring, and/or are about to occur within this District.

il. THE PARTIES

14. Plaintiff CFTC is an independent federal regulatory agency charged by
Congress with the administration and enforcement of the Act, as amended, 7TUS.C. Â§Â§ 1
et seq., and the Regulations promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1.1 et seq.

15. Defendant Harvard International was a Delaware corporation,
incorporated on or about February 21, 2008, with a place of business in Boca Raton,
Florida. During the First Relevant Period, Harvard International claimed to be a market
maker and dealer to retail customers in precious metals, including gold, silver, platinum,
and palladium bullion, as well as gold, silver, platinum, and palladium coins. Using
telemarketers and a website it owned, www.harvardassets.com, Harvard International
solicited retail customers to invest in leveraged, margined, or financed precious metals

transactions. From on or about April 29, 2008 to on or about April 30, 2010, Harvard
Case 0:15-cv-62049-XXXX Document1 Entered on FLSD Docket 09/28/2015 Page 5 of 27

International was registered with the Commission as an introducing broker, notice broker
dealer, and NFA member. Harvard Internationalâs status as a Delaware corporation was
revoked on or about March 1, 2014. Harvard International is not currently registered
with the Commission in any capacity.

16. | Defendant Harvard Assets was a Delaware limited liability company,
formed on or about April 18, 2012, with a place of business in Boca Raton, Florida, and
with the same address as Harvard International but a different suite number. During the
Second Relevant Period, Harvard Assets claimed to be a market maker and dealer to
retail customers in precious metals, including gold, silver, platinum, and palladium
bullion, as well as gold, silver, platinum, and palladium coins. Using telemarketers and
the website www.harvardassets.com, Harvard Assets solicited retail customers to invest
in leveraged, margined, or financed precious metals transactions. Harvard Assetsâ status
as a Delaware limited liability company was revoked on or about September 6, 2014.
Harvard Assets has never been registered with the Commission in any capacity.

17. Defendant London Assets, an affiliate of Harvard Assets, was a Delaware
corporation, incorporated on or about August 27, 2012, with a place of business in Boca
Raton, Florida, and with the same address as Harvard International. During the Second
Relevant Period, Harvard Assets and London Assets had at least one common officer,
employee, and/or agent. For leveraged, margined, or financed precious metals
transactions on behalf of Harvard Assetsâ customers that were introduced to Hunter Wise
Commodities, LLC (âHunter Wise Commoditiesâ), Harvard Assets solicited and
funneled the customer funds and orders to Hunter Wise Commodities through London

Assets. London Assetsâ status as a Delaware corporation was forfeited on or about
Case 0:15-cv-62049-XXXX Document1 Entered on FLSD Docket 09/28/2015 Page 6 of 27

January 26, 2014. London Assets has never been registered with the Commission in any
capacity.

18. | Defendant Todd Owen Marshall is an individual whose last known
address is in Deerfield Beach, Florida. During the First Relevant Period, Marshall was
President and a principal of Harvard International. During the Second Relevant Period,
Marshall was a principal of Harvard Assets, and was Director of the Board, Vice
President, and Treasurer of London Assets. For most of the period from January 1998
through May 2008, Marshall was registered with the Commission as an associated person
or principal of one or more Commission registrant firms. Marshall is not currently
registered with the Commission in any capacity.

19, Onor about June 30, 1999, the National Futures Association (âNFAâ)
Business Conduct Committee issued a complaint alleging that Marshall and others made
deceptive and misleading sales solicitations. On or about July 5, 2000, an NFA Hearing
Panel issued a decision ordering Marshall to pay a $5,000 fine, tape record his
conversations with customers for six months, maintain a log of his solicitations, retain the
tapes for two years, and promptly produce the same to the NFA or the CFTC upon
request.

20. On or about June 28, 2007, the NFA Business Conduct Committee issued
a complaint against Marshall and others, alleging misconduct by Marshall in connection
with another firm he owned and controlled, Sterling International Commodities
(âSterlingâ). On or about July 9, 2008, an NFA Hearing Panel issued a decision finding

that Marshall:

made misleading sales solicitations that exaggerated the profit potential of
trading options; . . . minimized the risk of loss of trading options and
Case 0:15-cv-62049-XXXX Document1 Entered on FLSD Docket 09/28/2015 Page 7 of 27

spreads; misrepresented the performance of Sterlingâs . . . customers;

misrepresented that Sterlingâs commissions were normal and customary

when, in fact, they were excessive . . . and failed to disclose that the vast

majority of Sterlingâs . . . customers lost money in the years immediately

prior to the solicitations.

21. The panel further found that Marshall used âhigh-pressure sales tactics,
failing to uphold high standards of commercial honor and just and equitable principles of
trade, and fail[ed] to supervise Sterlingâs sales force.â

22. | The panel barred Marshall from NFA membership or associated
membership and from acting as a principal of an NFA member for three years. Among
other things, the panel ordered Marshall to pay a $50,000 fine if, after the expiration of
the three-year membership bar, he were granted NFA membership or associated
membership or became a principal of an NFA Member. The panel also ordered Marshall
to tape record, for a period of one year, all conversations between him and existing and
potential customers and retain the tapes for a period of one year from the time they were
created if he again became an NFA member or associate. Finally, the panel ordered that
in the event Marshall became a principal of an NFA Member, Marshall would be
required to cause all associated persons of that firm, and of any firm of which he became
a principal, to tape record, for one year, all conversations that occurred between the
associated persons and existing or potential customers and to retain these tapes for a

period of one year from their creation.

preliminary injunction that, among other things, prohibited Hunter Wise from offering
investments in physical metals to the retail public, froze its assets, and appointed a
corporate monitor (Docket No. 78, Case No. 12-81311-CIV, aff'd by CFTC v. Hunter
Wise Commodities, LLC, et al., No. 13-10993 (11â¢ Cir. Apr. 15, 2014)). On February 19,
2014, the Court granted the Commissionâs motion for partial summary judgment, finding

U.S.C. Â§ 6(a), by engaging in or offering illegal off-exchange retail commodity
transactions (Docket No. 281, Case No. 12-81311-CIV). On May 16, 2014, following a
trial on remaining counts, the Court found that Hunter Wise âneither purchased precious
metals on the retail customersâ behalf. . . nor delivered metals to the retail customers,â
and entered a permanent injunction and imposed restitution and civil monetary penalties
against Hunter Wise. (Docket No. 303, Case No. 12-81311-CIV, at pp. 14-15, 54-58.)

located at 3900 Military Trail, Ste. 500, Jupiter, Florida 33458. Worth has never been
registered with the Commission in any capacity.

against Worth and its principals, captioned CFTC v. Worth Group, Inc., et al., Case No.
13-cv-80796-KLR, alleging, among other things, that Worth defrauded retail precious
metals customers and engaged in illegal, off-exchange leveraged commodity transactions
with retail customers. On January 23, 2014, the Court entered a Consent Order of
Preliminary Injunction and Other Ancillary Relief (Docket No. 61, Case No. 13-cv-
80796-KLR) that, among other relief, appointed a corporate monitor for Worth, and
enjoined Worth from violating certain provisions of the Act. On July 29, 2015, the Court
denied the CFTC and Worthâs cross-motions for summary judgment. (Docket No. 181,

Case No. 13-cv-80796-KLR).

V. STATUTORY BACKGROUND

29. Section 2(c)(2)(D) of the Act, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street
Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(c)(2)(D) (2012), gives the
Commission jurisdiction over âany agreement, contract, or transaction in any
commodityâ that is entered into with, or offered to, a person that is not an eligible
contract participant (âECPâ) or eligible commercial entity (âECEâ) âon a leveraged or
margined basis, or financed by the offeror, the counterparty, or a person acting in concert
with the offeror or counterparty on a similar basisâ (referred to herein as a âretail
commodity transactionâ) with respect to conduct occurring on or after July 16, 2011,
subject to certain exceptions not applicable here. In relevant part, Section 2(c)(2)(D) of
the Act makes Section 4(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6(a), applicable to retail commodity
transactions âas ifâ such transactions were âcontract[s] of sale of a commodity for future
delivery.â

relevant part, as an individual who has amounts invested on a discretionary basis, the
aggregate of which exceeds $10 million, or $5 million if the individual enters into the
transaction to manage the risk associated with an asset owned or liability incurred, or
reasonably likely to be owned or incurred, by the individual. Section 1a(17) of the Act, 7

connection with, a contract for the purchase or sale of a commodity for future delivery
unless the transaction is conducted on or subject to the rules of a board of trade that has
been designated or registered by the Commission as a contract market or derivatives
transaction execution facility for such commodity.

32. Section 4d(a)(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6d(a)(1), makes it unlawful for any
person to be an FCM unless such person is registered with the Commission. The Act

VI. FACTS

33. During the Relevant Periods, Defendants offered to enter into, entered
into, executed, confirmed the execution of, or conducted an office or business in the
United States for the purpose of soliciting, or accepting orders for, or otherwise dealing in
any transactions in, or in connection with, the purchase or sale of precious metals to or
from retail customers on a leveraged, margined, or financed basis. Only the leveraged,
margined, or financed precious metals transactions (hereinafter âfinanced precious metals
transactionsââ) that Defendants conducted through Hunter Wise and Worth are at issue in
this action.

A. Harvard International

34. During the First Relevant Period, Harvard International had a place of

business in Boca Raton, Florida.

11
Case 0:15-cv-62049-XXXX Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 09/28/2015 Page 12 of 27

35. Harvard International and its officers, employees, or agents, including
Marshall, solicited customers by telephone or through Harvard Internationalâs website,
www.harvardassets.com, to engage in financed precious metals transactions.

36. In these financed precious metals transactions, Harvard Internationalâs
customers invested only a percentage of the total metal value and would purportedly
receive a loan from Harvard International for the remainder of the metalâs value.
According to Harvard Internationalâs standard Account Agreement (âHarvard
International Agreementâ), Harvard Internationalâs customers incurred a finance charge
on their loans (up to 7 percent above the prime rate), as well as service/storage charges on
these transactions. Harvard Internationalâs customers also paid a commission, typically
15 percent, on the total metal value per transaction.

37. | The Harvard International Agreement provides, in part:

The formation of this Agreement constitutes the making of a contract in Palm

Beach County, Florida, notwithstanding the manner, timing or location of the

delivery or receipt of the acceptance of this Agreement by either party hereto.

The making of this contract will cause the following events, among others, to

occur in Palm Beach County, Florida: the negotiation of this contract will have

taken place and have been completed in Palm Beach County, Florida; the contract
will be executed in Palm Beach County, Florida; Harvard is located in Palm

Beach County, Florida; all deposits and payments made by Customer will be

delivered to and paid in Palm Beach County, Florida; all loans made by Harvard

will be made from and paid in Palm Beach County, Florida; and all statements of
account will be generated in an transmitted from Palm Beach County, Florida.

38. During the First Relevant Period, some of Harvard Internationalâs
customers were not ECPs or ECEs.

39. During the First Relevant Period, Harvard International and its officers,

employees, or agents solicited at least 42 retail customers to engage in at least 241

financed precious metals transactions, reflecting a total value of over $3.6 million worth

12
Case 0:15-cv-62049-XXXX Document1 Entered on FLSD Docket 09/28/2015 Page 13 of 27

of metals. Harvard International solicited and accepted over $1.5 million from those
customers with respect to these transactions. After Harvard International solicited retail
customers and accepted customer orders and funds for these transactions, Harvard
International extracted:commissions and fees from these funds, and then forwarded the
orders and funds to Worth. Worth failed to make actual delivery of metals to Harvard
International customers in connection with at least 241 financed precious metals
transactions.

40. During the First Relevant Period, Worth maintained a âmasterâ account
and customer sub-accounts at depositories with whom Worth contracted to hold metal.
Worth purported to deliver metal to retail customers by âallocatingâ metal from a master
account to customer sub-accounts. However, these purported âallocationsâ did not result
in the transfer of possession or control of metal to Harvard Internationalâs customers or
agents of the customers. Accordingly, there was no actual delivery of metals to Harvard
Internationalâs customers in connection with at least 241 financed precious metals
transactions.

41. Harvard Internationalâs commissions from these at least 241 financed
precious metals transactions introduced to Worth that did not result in actual delivery of
precious metals to Harvard Internationalâs customers totaled at least approximately
$540,000.

42. Furthermore, at least 29 of these financed precious metals transactions did
not result in âallocationsâ within 28 days after the transaction, and thus did not result in
timely actual delivery of metals to Harvard Internationalâs customers for this additional

reason.

13
Case 0:15-cv-62049-XXXX Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 09/28/2015 Page 14 of 27

43. During the First Relevant Period, none of the financed precious metals

execution facility.

51. In these financed precious metals transactions, Harvard Assetsâ customers
invested only a percentage of the total metal value, and received loans from Harvard
Assets for the remainder of the metalâs value. According to Harvard Assetsâ standard
Customer Account Documentation and Agreement (âHarvard Assets Agreementâ),
Harvard Assetsâ customers incurred a finance charge on their loans (up to 7 percent
above the prime rate), as well as service/storage charges on these transactions, and a $100
account opening fee. Harvard Assetsâ customers also paid a commission, typically 12
percent, on the total metal value per transaction.

52. The Harvard Assets Agreement provides, in part:

The formation of this Agreement constitutes the making of a contract in Palm

Beach County, Florida, notwithstanding the manner, timing or location of the

delivery or receipt of the acceptance of this Agreement by either party hereto.

The making of this contract will cause the following events, among others, to

customers paid at least $231,963 to Harvard Assets and London Assets in connection
with at least 48 financed precious metals transactions, reflecting a total value of over
$693,000 worth of metals.

57. These retail customers lost at least $146,003.45 of their funds to trading
losses, commissions, fees, and other charges imposed by Harvard Assets, London Assets,
and Hunter Wise.

58. Harvard Assets and London Assets received commissions totaling at least
