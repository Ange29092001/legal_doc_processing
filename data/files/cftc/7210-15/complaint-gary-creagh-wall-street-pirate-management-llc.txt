COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT

GARY CREAGH, and
WALL STREET PIRATE MANAGEMENT, LLC,

Defendants.

 

 

Plaintiff U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ) alleges as

follows:

I. SUMMARY

l. From at least December 2011 through September 2013 (the ârelevant periodââ),
Wall Street Pirate Management, LLC (ââWSPMâ), by and through its managing member and sole
employee Gary Creagh (âCreaghââ) (collectively the âDefendantsââ), made multiple false
statements to the National Futures Association (the âNFAâ), the self-regulatory organization for
the U.S. futures industry, in statutorily required reports and during an NFA audit of WSPM in
furtherance of NFAâs official duties under the Commodity Exchange Act (the âActâ), 7 U.S.C. -
Â§Â§ 1-23 (2012).

2. Creagh, individually and as the agent of WSPM, falsely represented to the NFA
that the Wall Street Pirate Fund, L.P. (the âWSPFâ or âWSPF commodity poolâ), a commodity
pool WSPM operated, was not active during calendar year 2012 despite that WSPM accepted

funds from participants in the WSPF commodity pool and actively traded commodity futures

contracts for the benefit of the WSPF commodity pool at an account in the poolâs name at futures
commission merchant (the âFCMâ) Interactive Brokers (the âPool Trading Accountâ) throughout
2012. As the sole person authorized to trade on behalf of WSPM, and the sole person who made
hundreds of trades as the agent of WSPM, Creagh knew he personally and actively traded the
Pool Trading Account on behalf of pool participants during the relevant period and knew his
statements to the NFA were false.

3. Defendantsâ actions violated Section 9(a)(4) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13(a)(4).
(2012), which makes it illegal for any person willfully to falsify, conceal, or cover up by any
trick, scheme, or artifice a material fact in communications with the NFA.

4, Additionally, throughout the relevant period, WSPM, by and through its agent
Creagh, failed to maintain required books and records and provide account statements and
privacy notices to WSPF pool participants, in violation of Section 4n(3)(A) and (4) of the Act, 7
U.S.C. Â§ 6n(3)(A), (4) (2012); Commission Regulation 1.31, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.31 (2012) (with
respect to conduct before January 2, 2013); Commission Regulation 1.31, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.31
(2012) (as amended by Adaptation of Regulations to Incorporate Swaps, 7 Fed. Reg. 66288,
66323 (Nov. 2, 2012)) (with respect to conduct on or after January 2, 2013 and before February
19, 2013); Commission Regulation 1.31, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.31 (2014) (with respect to conduct on or
after February 19, 2013); Commission Regulation 4.22, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 4.22 (2012) (with respect to
conduct before November 5, 2012); Commission Regulation 4.22, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 4.22 (2014) (with
respect to conduct on or after November 5, 2012); Commission Regulation 4.23, 17 C.F.R.

Â§ 4.23 (2012) (with respect to conduct before November 5, 2012); Commission Regulation 4.23,
17 C.F.R. Â§ 4.23 (2012) (as amended by Amendments to Commodity Pool Operator and

Commodity Trading Advisor Regulations Resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act, 77 Fed. Reg.

 
Case 1:15-cv-06140 Document1 Filed 08/05/15 Page 3 of 24

54355, 54358 (Sept. 5, 2012)) (with respect to conduct on or after November 5, 2012 and before
January 2, 2013); Commission Regulation 4.23, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 4.23 (2013) (with respect to conduct
on or after January 2, 2013 and before September 23, 2013); Commission Regulation 4.23, 17
C.F.R. Â§ 4.23 (2014) (with respect to conduct on or after September 23, 2013); Commission
Regulation 160.6, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 160.6 (2011) (with respect to conduct before January 1, 2012);
and Commission Regulation 160.6, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 160.6 (2014) (with respect to conduct on or after
January 1, 2012).

5. Creaghâs false statements to the NFA concealed that WSPM had not maintained
the books and records or provided the account statements and notices to pool participants
required by the Act and Commission Regulations.

6. Accordingly, the Commission brings this action pursuant to Section 6c of the Act,
7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2012), to enjoin Defendantsâ unlawful acts and to compel their compliance
with the Act and Commission Regulations. In addition, the Commission seeks civil monetary
penalties, disgorgement, and such other equitable relief as the Court may deem necessary or
appropriate.

II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

7. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 6c of the Act,

7 ULS.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2012), which authorizes the Commission to seek injunctive and other relief
against any person whenever it appears to the Commission that such person has engaged, is
engaging, or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a violation of any provision of
the Act or any rule, regulation, or order thereunder.

8. Venue lies properly in this District pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
Â§ 13a-1(e) (2012), because the Defendants transacted business in the Southern District of New

York, and Defendantsâ acts and practices in violation of the Act occurred within this District.

Il. THE PARTIES

9, Plaintiff United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an
independent federal regulatory agency charged by Congress with the administration and
enforcement of the Act and the Commission Regulations promulgated thereunder. The
Commission maintains its principal office at 1155 21st Street NW, Washington, DC 20581.

10. Defendant Wall Street Pirate Management, LLC is a Pennsylvania limited
liability company with its principal place of business listed as Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
WSPM also regularly conducted business from offices in New York, New York. WSPM was
registered with the Commission as a commodity pool operator (âCPOâ) from December 2011
through September 2013.

11. Defendant Gary Creagh is the sole managing member of WSPM and its only
employee. Creagh controls WSPMâs operations, finances, accounts, and books and records, and
he is the sole signatory on WSPMâs bank account and sole person authorized to trade its
commodity accounts on behalf of pool participants. During the relevant period, Creagh resided
and worked in both Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and New York, New York. Creagh was
registered with the Commission as an associated person (âAPâ) of WSPM throughout the
relevant period.

IV. OTHER RELEVANT ENTITY

12. Wall Street Pirate Fund, L.P. was a Delaware limited partnership. WSPF was a
single-advisor commodity pool that provided a means by which investors could engage in the
buying and selling of commodity interests. WSPM was the general partner and CPO of WSPF.

13. The National Futures Association is a futures association registered with the
Commission pursuant to Section 17 of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 21 (2012). Membership in the NFA is

-4-
Case 1:15-cv-06140 Document1 Filed 08/05/15 Page 5 of 24

industry, including CPOs and APs of CPOs. Pursuant to its official duties as a registered futures
association, the NFA has developed a body of rules to safeguard market integrity, protect
investors from fraud, and help futures entities and their APs meet regulatory responsibilities.
NFA members are subject to audits and investigations by the NFA to ensure compliance with
NFA rules, the Act, and Commission Regulations. Cooperation and candor by NFA members
with NFA compliance and audit staff are critical to the NFAâs ability to discharge its obligations
as a registered futures association to, among other things, protect members of the public from
persons or entities unlawfully soliciting customers, accepting customer orders, or exercising
trading discretion on behalf of customers.

V. FACTS

A. Operation of the WSPF Commodity Pool

14. On or about March 15, 2012, Creagh, acting as the agent of WSPM, opened a
commodity trading account at the FCM Interactive Brokers in the name of the WSPF commodity
pool. WSPM was identified as the CPO of the pool, and Creagh was identified as the sole
principal of WSPM authorized to effect transactions for the benefit of the Pool Trading Account.

15. | Onor about March 15, 2012, Creagh invested $150,000 with WSPM to
participate in the WSPF commodity pool. On or about that same day, Creagh, acting as the agent
of WSPM as its CPO, deposited the $150,000 into a WSPM account at TD Bank and then
transferred via wire the $150,000 into the Pool Trading Account. Creagh opened the TD Bank
account in the name of WSPM.

16.  Atall times relevant hereto, Creagh was the sole employee of WSPM, the sole
managing member of WSPF, the sole signatory on the WSPM bank account at TD Bank, and the
sole person authorized to trade the commodity trading account carried in the name of WSPF at

the FCM Interactive Brokers. Accordingly, at all times relevant hereto Creagh had personal

.5-
Case 1:15-cv-06140 Documenti Filed 08/05/15 Page 6 of 24

knowledge of the total amount of funds accepted by the pool from participants, the disposition of
said funds, as well as the number of trades effected on behalf of pool participants in the poolâs
commodity trading account and the date each trade was made.

17. Immediately after Creagh transferred the $150,000 into the Pool Trading Account,
WSPM, by and through Creagh, began actively operating the WSPF commodity pool by buying
and selling commodity futures contracts in the Pool Trading Account for the benefit of the
WSPF commodity pool, as described below.

18. On or about April 10, 2012, an acquaintance of Creagh invested $50,000 with
Defendants to participate in the WSPF commodity pool. On or about May 2, 2012, WSPM, by
and through its agent Creagh, deposited these funds into the WSPM account at TD Bank and
then transferred the funds by wire into the Pool Trading Account.

19. On or about May 30, 2012, another acquaintance of Creagh invested $50,000 with
Defendants to participate in the WSPF commodity pool. On or about July 12, 2012, WSPM, by
and through its agent Creagh, deposited the $50,000 into the WSPM account at TD Bank and
then transferred the $50,000 by wire into the Pool Trading Account.

20. All of the funds transferred into the Pool Trading Account were funds belonging
to the WSPF commodity pool participants and were used to effect commodity futures
transactions.

21. Asreflected in the daily activity statements for the Pool Trading Account,
WSPM, by and through its agent Creagh, placed hundreds of commodity futures trades for the

benefit of the pool throughout calendar year 2012.
Case 1:15-cv-06140 Document1 Filed 08/05/15 Page 7 of 24

B. False Statements Made to the NFA

22. In furtherance of its official duties under the Act, the NFA conducts periodic
audits and examinations of NFA members as a means of monitoring and assuring compliance
with NFA rules, the Act, and Commission Regulations.

23. In addition, pursuant to NFA rules, the Act, and Commission Regulations, CPOs
are required to file with the NFA quarterly financial reports for each pool the CPO operates.
CPOs may file these quarterly reports electronically with the NFA using the NFAâs EasyFile
system (the âEasyFileâ). One of the prompts for an individual effecting a report using EasyFile
. 1 whether the pool at issue was active or not during the reporting period.

24. During the relevant period, WSPM, by and through its agent Creagh, filed four
false written quarterly reports with the NFA and thereafter made false oral statements to the NFA
during an NFA audit of WSPM.

25. | Onor about May 31, 2012, WSPM, by and through its agent Creagh, filed with
the NFA through EasyFile a false quarterly report for the quarter ending March 30, 2012.

26. Despite that between March 15, 2012 and March 31, 2012, WSPM accepted funds
from a pool participant and traded multiple commodity futures contracts in the Pool Trading
Account for the benefit of that pool participant, WSPM, by and through its agent Creagh, falsely
represented to the NFA that the WSPF commodity pool did not operate during that period.
Creagh knew this statement was false as he knew WSPM had accepted WSPF pool participant
funds and he actively traded commodity futures contracts as the agent of WSPF during the
reporting period.

27. | On about September 12, 2012, WSPM, by and through its agent Creagh, filed a

second false quarterly report with the NFA through EasyFile.
Case 1:15-cv-06140 Document1 Filed 08/05/15 Page 8 of 24

28. Despite that between April 1, 2012 and June 30, 2012, WSPM accepted $100,000
from two pool participants and traded multiple commodity futures contracts in the Pool Trading
Account on behalf of the WSPF commodity pool, WSPM, by and through its agent Creagh,
falsely represented to the NFA that the WSPF commodity pool did not operate during that
period. Creagh knew this statement was false as he knew WSPM had accepted WSPF pool
participant funds and he had actively traded commodity futures contracts as the agent of WSPF
during the reporting period.

29. Onor about February 12, 2013, WSPM, by and through its agent Creagh, filed
additional false reports with NFA through EasyFile.

30. Despite that WSPM traded multiple commodity futures contracts in the Pool
Trading Account on behalf of WSPF between July 1, 2012 and December 31, 2012, WSPM, by
and through its agent Creagh, falsely represented to the NFA that the WSPF commodity pool did
not operate during that period. Creagh knew this statement was false as he had actively traded
commodity futures contracts on behalf of WSPF during the reporting period.

31. On June 12, 2014, during testimony under oath before the Commission, Creagh
admitted filing false quarterly reports with NFA.

32. Subsequent to the filing of these false reports, on March 4, 2013, the NFA
conducted an unannounced on-site audit of WSPM, at its offices in New York, New York, to
ensure the firm was in compliance with its recordkeeping and financial requirements.

33. During the audit, Creagh, individually and as the agent and managing member of
WSPM, falsely represented to the NFA orally that WSPF was not active during calendar year

2012. Creagh knew these statements were false as he knew WSPM had accepted funds from
Case 1:15-cv-06140 Documenti Filed 08/05/15 Page 9 of 24

prospective pool participants and he actively traded commodity futures contracts in the Pool
Trading Account on behalf of WSPF throughout calendar year 2012.

34. OnJune 12, 2014, during testimony under oath before the Commission, Creagh
admitted that the WSPF commodity pool was active in 2012. Creagh also admitted that WSPM
accepted funds from WSPF pool participants and traded commodity futures contracts on behalf

of WSPF throughout 2012.

C. Failure to Keep Books and Records, and Provide Account Statements and Privacy
Notices to Pool Participants

35. As described in more detail below, the Act and Commission Regulations require
registered CPOs to maintain certain books and records concerning the CPO and each pool it
operates, and provide periodic account statements and privacy notices to pool participants.

36. Atall times during the relevant period, the WSPF commodity pool held net assets
less than $500,000.

37. Despite operating the WSPF commodity pool during the relevant period by
among other things, accepting pool participant funds and trading commodity futures on behalf of
the pool, WSPM failed to maintain the books and records required by Commission Regulations.

38. Specifically, WSPM did not maintain, among other books and records: (1) a
general ledger, (2) statement of financial condition, (3) statement of income/loss, and/or (4) a
cash receipts and disbursements journal.

39. On June 12, 2014, during testimony under oath before the Commission, Creagh
admitted that the WSPF commodity pool, which WSPM operated, did not maintain these

required records.
Case 1:15-cv-06140 Document1 Filed 08/05/15 Page 10 of 24

40. Additionally, despite operating the WSPF commodity pool during the relevant
period, WSPM failed to prepare and distribute periodic accounts statements to the WSPF
commodity pool participants, as required by the Act and Commission Regulations.

41. Specifically, WSPM failed to provide pool participants with at least quarterly
account statements covering the ten month period during which WSPM operated the WSPF pool
in 2012, and a timely annual report for 2012.

42. On June 12, 2014, during testimony under oath before the Commission, Creagh
admitted that during the life of the WSPF commodity pool, he never provided pool participants
monthly or quarterly account statements.

43. Furthermore, WSPM failed to provide to the WSPF pool participants the privacy
notices required by Commission Regulations. Specifically, WSPM failed to notify pool
participants of the categories of nonpublic personal information that WSPM collected and
WSPMâs policies and practices with respect to protecting the confidentiality and security of that
information, as required by Commission Regulation 160.6, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 160.6 (2011) (with
respect to conduct before January 1, 2012), and Commission Regulation 160.6, 17 C.F.R.

Â§ 160.6 (2014) (with respect to conduct on or after January 1, 2012).

44. On June 12, 2014, during testimony under oath before the Commission, Creagh
admitted that WSPM did not provide this required information to the WSPF pool participants.

45. Unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, Defendants are likely to continue to
engage in the acts and practices alleged in this Complaint and in similar acts and practices.

fraudulent statements or representations, or make or use any false
writing or document knowing the same to contain any false,
fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry to a registered entity,
board of trade, swap data repository, or futures association
designated or registered under this Act acting in furtherance of its
official duties under this Act.

48. Creagh, individually and as the agent of WSPM, willfully made materially false
statements to the NFA, and concealed material information from the NFA, in statutorily required
reports and during oral communications with NFA staff during an NFA audit in furtherance of
the NFAâs official duties under the Act, in violation of Section 9(a)(4) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.

Â§ 13(a)(4) (2012).

49. Specifically, as alleged above, Creagh, individually and as the agent of WSPM,
falsely stated to NFA staff during an NFA audit and in statutorily required reports filed with the
NFA that the WSPF commodity pool did not operate during calendar year 2012.

50. | Creagh knew that these material statements were false as he personally accepted
funds from participants in the WSPF commodity pool as the agent of WSPF, and he actively
traded commodity futures contracts in the Pool Trading Account on behalf of WSPF during
2012.

51. By making false statements to the NFA, and by concealing trading activity from
the NFA, Creagh, individually and as the agent of WSPM, willfully falsified, concealed, and

pursuant to Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(a)(1)(B) (2012), and Commission
Regulation 1.2, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.2 (2014).

directly or indirectly, and did not act in good faith or knowingly induced, directly or indirectly,
the acts constituting WSPMâs violations of Section 9(a)(4) of the Act. Therefore, Creagh is
liable for WSPMâs violations of Section 9(a)(4) of the Act, pursuant to Section 13(b) of the Act,
7 ULS.C. Â§ 13Â¢(b) (2012).

54. Each false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement, representation, or omission, and
each act of concealment, including but not limited to those specifically alleged herein, is alleged
as a separate and distinct violation of Section 9(a)(4) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13(a)(4) (2012).

WSPMâs violations of Commission Regulation 160.6, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 160.6 (2011) (with respect to

conduct before January 1, 2012), and Commission Regulation 160.6, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 160.6 (2014)
