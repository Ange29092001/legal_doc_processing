CFTC Obtains Judgment against Commodity Pool Operators TOTE Fund LLC and MJS
Capital Management LLC, and their Principal, Michael J. Siegel, for Commodity Pool Fraud
and Other Violations

Federal Court Orders Defendants to Pay More than $871,000 in
Restitution, Disgorgement, and Civil Monetary Penalties

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced that Judge Noel L. Hillman
of the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey entered an Order of default judgment and permanent injunction
against Defendants TOTE Fund LLC (TOTE) and MJS Capital Management LLC (MJS), two Commodity Pool Operators,
and their sole principal Michael J. Siegel of Northfield, New Jersey.

The courtâs Order requires Siegel and MJS, jointly and severally, to pay restitution of $104,684.47, disgorgement of
$86,503.36, and a civil monetary of $259,510.08. Siegel and TOTE are also jointly and severally required to pay
disgorgement of $105,185.89 and a civil monetary penalty of $315,557.67. The Order further imposes permanent trading
and registration bans against all Defendants. The Order, entered on December 30, 2014, stems from a CFTC Complaint
filed on September 27, 2013 (see CFTC Press Release 6723-13).

The Order finds that Defendants violated the Commodity Exchange Act by misappropriating funds totaling approximately
$191,689 from Monarch Futures Fund LLC (Monarch) and QEP Futures Fund LLC (QEP), two commodity pools
operated by TOTE and MJS, respectively, by withdrawing money from the pools for non-pool expenses and taking fees to
which they were not entitled. According to the Order, despite earning incentive, management, and administrative fees of
$319,909 based on his trading, Siegel transferred approximately $511,598 from bank accounts in the names of Monarch,
QEP, and TOTE to his personal bank accounts, to a credit card account, and to at least one individual and used some of
these funds to pay personal expenses.

The Order further finds that MJS and Siegel misappropriated funds by failing to return funds to at least two pool
participants who sought to withdraw their funds from QEP. Also, TOTE, acting through Siegel, failed to provide Monarch
pool participants with copies of monthly statements received by TOTE from Futures Commission Merchants, as required
by a CFTC Regulation, the Order finds.

The CFTC cautions victims that restitution orders may not result in the recovery of money lost because the wrongdoers
may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers and to
ensure the wrongdoers are held accountable.

The CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Kara L. Mucha, James A. Garcia, Michael W.
Solinsky, Charles D. Marvine, and Gretchen L. Lowe.
