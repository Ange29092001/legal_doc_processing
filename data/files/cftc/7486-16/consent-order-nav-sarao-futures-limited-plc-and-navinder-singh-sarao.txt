CONSENT ORDER OF PERMAMENT
INJUNCTION, CIVIL MONETARY PENALTY, AND OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF
AGAINST NAVINDER SINGH SARAO

I, INTRODUCTION

On April 17, 2015, Plaintiff U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the
Commission or CFTC) filed its Complaint for Injunctive Relief, Civil Monetary Penalties and
Other Equitable Relief (Complaint) against Nav Sarao Futures Limited PLC (Sarao Futures) an
Navinder Singh Sarao (Sarao) (collectively, Defendants) (Dkt. #1) for violations of Sections
4c(a)(5)(C), 6(c)(1) and (3),â and 9(a)(2) of the Commodity Exchange Act (Act), 7 U.S.C.

Â§Â§ 6c(a)(5)(C), 9(1) & (3), and 13(a)(2) (2012), and Commission Regulations (Regulations)
180.1 and 180.2, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 180.2 (2014). Simultaneously, Plaintiff filed an ex parte Motion
for Statutory Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction seeking, among other things, an order
prohibiting Defendants from withdrawing or dissipating funds and assets, granting Plaintiff

access to Defendantsâ books and records, and requiring Defendants to appear and show cause

 

" Section 6(c)(1) and (3) of the Act became effective on August 15, 2011. Prior to that date, Defendantsâ conduct
violated Section 6(c) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 9, 15 (2008).

1

 
why a preliminary injunction should not be issued against them. (Dkt. #7). That same day, this
Court issued an order granting the ex parte relief requested by Plaintiff. (Dkt. # 13).

On June 29, 2015, the Court entered a Consent Preliminary Injunction that, among other
things, prohibited Sarao from trading on or subject to the rules of any registered entity (as that
term is defined in Section 1a(40) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1a(40) (2012)) or from entering into any
transactions involving âcommodity interestsâ (as that term is defined in Regulation 1.3(yy), 17
C.F.R. Â§ 1.3(yy) (2014)) and modified this Courtâs previously issued asset freeze. (Dkt. # 46).
âOn August 12, 2015, this Court entered a Default Order of Preliminary Injunction against Sarao
Futures, imposing similar ee relief. (Dkt. #55).

I. FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Court, being fully advised in the premises, finds that there is good cause for the entry
of this Consent Order and that there is no just reason for delay. The Court therefore directs the
entry of the following Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, permanent injunction, civil
monetary penalty and equitable relief pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2012),
as Set forth herein.

THE PARTIES AGREE AND THE COURT HEREBY FINDS:

A. Findings of Fact
1. Parties to this Consent Order

14. âPlaintiff U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an independent federal
regulatory agency that is charged by Congress with the responsibility for administering and
enforcing the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1-26 (2012), and the Regulations promulgated thereunder, 17
C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1.1-190.10 (2014). One of its core responsibilities is to protect the public interest by
deterring and preventing price manipulations of the commodities or futures markets or other
disruptions to market integrity. See 7 U.S.C. Â§ 5(b) (2012).

15. Defendant Navinder Singh Sarao resides in London, England and is the owner
and sole employee and trader of Sarao Futures. Sarao was responsible for trades on behalf of
Sarao Futures at all times relevant to this Consent Order. Sarao has been a member of the CME
since May 2008. Sarao has never been registered with the Commission.

2. Defendantsâ Futures Trading

16. From at least April 2010 to January 2012; July 2012 to June 2014; and September
2014 to April 17, 2015 (Relevant Period), Defendants principal business was trading futures
contractsâprimarily very high volumes in the Chicago Mercantile Exchangeâs (CMEâs) E-mini

S&P 500 futures near month contract (E-mini S&P). From April 2010 to September 2014, all

5

 
 

Sarao Futuresâs E-mini S&P trading was done by Sarao, its sole employee. Beginning in
October 2014, Sarao began trading E-mini S&P contracts in a personal account in a manner
similar to Sarao Futuresâs prior trading. On most days, Defendants traded tens of thousands of
E-mini S&P contracts (worth billions of dollars in notional value), but typically maintained open
positions for a very short time in an attempt to quickly take advantage of small price movements.

17. During the Relevant Period, Defendants utilized a combination of automated and
manual trading systems to place, modify, and cancel orders, resulting in a very high number of
orders, modifications, cancelations, and transactions, especially compared to other E-mini S&P
market participants. Defendants actively traded in the E-mini S&P market on more than 800
days during the Relevant Period.

18. Generally, during the Relevant Period, Defendants employed a high-frequency,
day-trading strategy in the E-mini S&P market. Accordingly, during the Relevant Period,
Defendants frequently would establish large, short-term positions on either side of the market
throughout the day and quickly trade out of those positions. Defendants typically repeated this
cycle many times a day, but would normally begin and end each day flat, holding no positions.

19. For example, on May 4, 2010, Defendants had established a long position of over
2,000 E-mini S&P contracts, and over a 40-minute period, then proceeded to repeatedly sell and
buy E-mini S&P contracts such that, at the end the 40-minute period, Defendants had established
a short position of over 1,500 contracts. This cycle was repeated several times during the day,
and Defendants ultimately ended the day flat, profiting $876,823 from this trading. On that day,
Defendants had the fifth-highest trading volume in the E-mini S&P, trading 130,030 E-mini S&P

contracts.

 
 

3. The E-mini S&P Market

20. Trading in the E-mini S&P is conducted electronically via the CMEâs Globex
electronic trading system. Globex traders have the ability to enter, modify, and cancel bids and
offers in a matter of milliseconds through a computer portal to the Globex platform.

21. Whena âbuyâ or âsellâ order is placed on Globex, the order becomes part of the
order book. The order book displays the total order volume ten ticks deep on both the bid and
ask sides. Individual orders are aggregated at each tick so it is typically not possible for market
participants to identify individual orders within the order book. Globex functions such that the
best available bid or ask price must be taken (âhitâ or âliftedââ) by the market for a trade to occur,
before the next available best bid or ask price can be taken. The best bid price is the highest
available price for buy orders that are posted in the market. The best ask price is the lowest
available price for sell orders that are posted in the market.

22. Many market participants, relying on the information contained in the order book,
consider the total relative number of bid and ask offers in the order book when making trading
decisions. For instance, if the total number of sell orders significantly outweighs the total
number of buy orders, market participants may believe a price drop is imminent and trade
accordingly. Similarly, if the balance of buy and sell orders changes abruptly, market
participants may believe the new orders represent legitimate changes to supply and demand and
therefore trade accordingly. Further, many market participants utilize automated trading systems
that analyze the market for these types of order imbalances and use that information to determine
trading strategies. Consequently, actions in the order book can, and do, affect the price of the E-

mini S&P.

 
 

4. Defendantsâ Manipulative Scheme

23. During the Relevant Period, Defendants engaged in a scheme to manipulate the
price of the E-mini S&P utilizing a variety of manual and automated spoofing tactics in the E-
mini S&P order book designed to cause price swings that Defendants could exploit through their
trading.

24. More specifically, Defendants placed thousands of orders to buy or to sell E-mini
S&P futures contracts that they did not intend to execute at the time the orders were placed
(Spoof Crilens), Defendantsâ intent in placing these Spoof Orders was to create a materially false
and misleading impression of supply (when placing sell-side Spoof Orders) and demand (when
placing buy-side Spoof Orders) in order to induce other market participants to react to the false
Spoof Order information and to buy or sell E-mini S&P futures contracts at prices, quantities,
and/or times that, but for Defendantsâ Spoof Orders, they would not otherwise have traded.

25. In thousands of instances, Defendants were able to induce other market
participants into buying or selling E-mini S&P futures contacts by placing the Spoof Orders,
which had the additional purpose and effect of artificially depressing (in the case of sell-side
Spoof Orders) or artificially inflating (in the case of buy-side Spoof Orders) the price of Benin
S&P futures contracts when the Spoof Orders were active. After causing artificial prices in the
E-mini S&P futures market, Defendants frequently executed real, genuine orders (Genuine
Executed Orders) to buy (typically at artificially low prices) or sell (typically at artificially high
prices) E-mini S&P futures contracts.

26. Defendants frequently were able to generate significant trading profits from
buying and selling the Genuine Executed Orders in close temporal proximity to the placement of

the Spoof Orders by either exiting from pre-existing positions that Defendants established before

 
 

placing the Spoof Orders or quickly placing and executing Genuine Executed Orders while the

Spoof Orders were active.
a) Defendantsâ Automated Manipulative/Spoofing Techniques

Zi. In late 2008, Defendants began utilizing the services of computer programmers to
assist in developing automated spoofing functionality. Ultimately, with the assistance of
programmers, Defendants created and utilized at least two different automated programs to
generate, modify, and cancel Spoof Ordersâthe âDynamic Layering Programâ and the âBack-
of-Queue Program.â Defendants activated these automated programs by Sarao clicking his
mouse on pre-programmed âbuttonsâ and deactivated the programs by Sarao clicking his mouse |
on the âbuttonsâ again.

28. In working with the computer programmers to create and perfect the automated
trading programs, Defendants demonstrated an intent to use the programs to place orders (1) with
no intention of executing those orders; and (2) with an intention to affect E-mini S&P market
prices.

29. For instance, on January 26, 2009, Sarao emailed a programmer, indicating he had
a prototype of an automated program running and that â[w]e now need to make it workable in
terms of me moving the market like we discussed.â A week later, Sarao emailed the same
programmer indicating that when he was âshort,â he wanted to âspoof [the market] down.â

30. On February 24, 2009, Sarao emailed the same programmer asking that the
program be designed so that âit is very easy for me to enter orders of varying different amounts.
Thatâs what Ineed.. If I keep entering the same clip sizes, people will become aware of what I
am doing, rendering my spoofing pointless.â Three days later, Sarao emailed the same
programmer, demanding tweaks to the automated functionality and indicating he was âgetting hit

on my spoofs all the time and itâs costing me money.â

9
 

31. Subsequently, Sarao continued attempting to perfect the automated trading
programs. Beginning in June 2009, Sarao sought assistance from another programmer employed
by the company that designed and sold his off-the-shelf trading platform. In that email, Sarao
indicated that he wanted the trading program to be altered to have numerous additional functions,
including, among other things:

e a âcancel if close functionâ;

e the ability to âalternate the closeness ie one price away or three prices
awayâ;

e âa facility to be able to enter multiple orders at different prices using one
clickâ;

e ât]he ability for my orders to rest on particular size, ie my order will be
pulled if there are not x amount of orders beneath itâ; and

e ââ[t}he ability for my orders to only allow 1 clip to go into them. Hence, if
Iam working 500 lot and a 2 lot trades, the 498 balance is removed
immediately.â

32. In November 2009, Sarao emailed a representative of the trading platform
company thanking him for assisting in modifying the trading platform and noting that he âfound
[the modified platform] really useful.â Sarao further indicated that

[t]he system you set up was basically one whereby I turn the
[trading platform] on or off and when it was turned on it would put
offers a specific value and quantity away from the best offer. In
the version you set up, we always had offers 3, 4, 5 and 6 prices
away from the best offer.

Sarao went on to request that the trading system company representative give Sarao the code

directly so that Sarao could âplay around with creating new versionsâ of the modified platform.

10

 
 

(1) Defendantsâ Use of the Dynamic Layering Program
33. Defendants routinely used the Dynamic Layering Program to place 4 to 6
exceptionally large sell orders into the order book, each one tick from the next, generally
beginning at least three or four ticks from the best asking price. As the market price moved, the
Dynamic Layering Program automatically and simultaneously modified the large layered sell
orders at the various price levels, resulting in Defendantsâ orders generally remaining at least
three or four ticks from the best asking price in the order book. These large layered orders were
modified hundreds of times to keep them from resulting in executed trades, before eventually
being canceled.
34. During the Relevant Period, Defendants activated the Dynamic Layering Program
3,653 times, resulting in the placement of 19,888 layered orders of various lot sizes.
35. During the Relevant Period, on average:
e it took only 500 milliseconds for the Dynamic Layering Programâs layered
sell orders to move in unison and in symmetry with the market price after
a change (either up or down) in market price.
e Defendantsâ layered sell orders contained approximately 2,000 sell orders
(at multiple price levels), with a combined average face value of
approximately $128,615,160.
e the Dynamic Layering Program was active approximately 7 minutes at a
time, and, when active, the E-mini S&P prices dropped, on average, more

than 1 tick.

11

 
 

e Defendantsâ Genuine Executed Orders were at least 1.7 times more
profitable per contract traded when the Dynamic Layering Program was
active than when no Spoof Orders were active.

36. During the Relevant Period, only 90 of the Defendantsâ 19,888 layered sell orders
were even partially executed.

37. During the Relevant Period, Defendants profited at least $9,667,258.22 as a result
of the Dynamic Layering Program.

38. During the Relevant Period, Defendantsâ purpose and intent in using the Dynamic
Layering Program was to place layered sell orders (i.e., Spoof Orders) into the E-mini S&P
market to create a false sense of supply, induce other market participants to react to this false
sense of supply, and create an artificial price in the E-mini S&P futures contractsâall so that
Defendants could profit, mitigate potential losses, and/or liquidate positions at more favorable
prices than were otherwise available without the use of the Dynamic Layering Program.

(2) Defendantsâ Use of the Back-of-Queue Program

39. Defendants used the Back-of-Queue Program to place Spoof Orders at various
price levels of the visible order book, including at the best ask or bid. The purpose of the Back-
of-Queue orders was to place large orders in the visible E-mini S&P order book to affect prices,
but minimize the chances that such orders would result in executed trades.

40. The Back-of-Queue Program minimized the chance of Defendantsâ orders being
executed by taking advantage of the CMEâs âfirst in, first outâ order matching functionality.
This functionality placed orders at the same price level in a queue, arranged from first received
to last received, meaning orders later in the queue were less likely to result in executed trades.

Further, the CMEâs order matching functionality dictated that if an order quantity was increased

12

 
(but not if it was decreased), that order would be moved to the back of the queue at that price
level, as if it were an entirely new order.

41. Defendantsâ Back-of-Queue Program took advantage of this CME matching
functionality by modifying the quantity of Defendantsâ Spoof Orders up by one contract if other
market participants entered an order of a certain size at the same price level after Defendants
Back-of-Queue Program orders were placed. Thus, when active, Defendantsâ Back-of-Queue
Program continually moved Defendantsâ Spoof Orders to the back of the queue at a particular
price level as new orders entered the market and greatly minimized the chances of that order
resulting in an executed trade.

42. Defendants placed at least 2,136 Back-of-Queue Program orders from January
2012 to October 2013. On average:

e Defendants utilized 2.2 Back-of-Queue Program orders at any one time,
with an aggregate combined size of 795 lots, for an average combined face
value of $59,348,904.

e the Back-of-Queue Program was active approximately 3 minutes at a time,
and, when active, the E-mini S&P price moved by more than half a tick.

e the percentage of Back-of-Queue Program order lots (which were
typically orders at the best bid or ask or within two price points from the
price) that were filled was 3.5 percent.

e Defendantsâ Genuine Executed Orders were at least 3.2 times more
profitable per contract traded when his Back-of-Queue Program orders

were active than when no Spoof Orders were active.

13

 
43. During the Relevant Period, Defendants profited at least $1,319,791.54 as a result
of the Back-of-Queue Program.

44. During the Relevant Period, Defendantsâ purpose and intent in using the Back-of-
Queue Program was to place the Back-of-Queue orders (i.e., Spoof Orders) into the E-mini S&P
market to create a false sense of supply and/or demand, induce other market participants to react
to this false sense of supply, and create an artificial price in the E-mini S&P futures contractâall
so that Defendants could profit, mitigate potential losses, and/or liquidate positions at more
favorable prices than were otherwise available without the use of the Back-of-Queue Program.

b) Defendantsâ Manual Manipulative/Spoofing Techniques

45. In addition to the automated spoofing programs, Defendants engaged in at least
two manual spoofing techniquesâââFlash 2,000-Lot Spoofingâ and âResting Spoof Orders.â

dd ) Defendantsâ Use of Flash 2,000-Lot Spoofing

46. Defendants frequently placed a 2,000-lot order at the best bid or offer and traded
a Genuine Executed Order on the opposite side while his 2,000-lot order was active or within 1
second of canceling his 2,000-lot order (Flash 2,000-Lot Orders).

47. Defendants mitigated the risk of the Flash 2,000-Lot Orders being executed in
two ways. First, often the placing of the Flash 2,000-Lot Orders caused the prevailing market
price to move one or more ticks away from the order, meaning the Flash 2,000-Lot Order was no
longer at the best ask or bid and, thus, not likely to result in execution. Second, if the prevailing
price did not move away from the Flash 2,000-Lot Order, Defendants nearly always successfully
canceled the Flash 2,000-Lot Order prior to any execution. When Defendantsâ Genuine
Executed Orders were fully filled opposite the Flash 2,000-Lot Orders, Defendants typically
cancelled the Flash 2,000-Lot Order within 2 seconds of fully filling his Genuine Executed

Orders. Approximately 98% of the Flash 2,000-Lot Orders were canceled prior to execution.

14

 
 

48. During the Relevant Period, Defendants placed approximately 800 Flash 2,000-
Lot Orders. On average:

e Defendantsâ Genuine Executed Orders that traded opposite Defendantsâ
Flash 2,000-Lot Order were significantly smallerâonly 185.5 lots;

e despite being placed at the best bid or ask, only 2.1% (or approximately
0.4% by lot) of the Flash 2,000-Lot Orders were filled; and

e Defendantsâ Genuine Executed Orders that traded opposite Defendantsâ
Flash 2,000-Lot Orders were more than 16 times more profitable per
contract traded than his other Genuine Executed Orders.

49. ~ During the Relevant Period, Defendants profited at least $1,884,537.50 as a result
of their Flash 2,000-Lot Orders.

50. During the Relevant Period, Defendantsâ purpose and intent in using the Flash
2,000-Lot Orders was to place the Flash 2,000-Lot Orders (i.e., Spoof Orders) into the E-mini
S&P market to create a false sense of supply and/or demand, induce other market participants to
react to this false sense of supply, and create an artificial price in the E-mini S&P futures
contractâall so that Defendants could profit, mitigate potential losses, and/or liquidate positions
at more favorable prices than were otherwise available without the use of the Flash 2,000-Lot
Orders.

(2) Defendantsâ Use of Resting Spoof Orders

51. | Another manual technique Defendants regularly used was to place resting Spoof
Orders in large quantities, at least one or two levels away from the best bids or offers (Resting
Spoof Orders). Defendants often placed these Resting Spoof Orders in combination with other

Spoof Orders and would trade Genuine Executed Orders opposite and in close temporal

15

 
 

proximity to the Resting Spoof Orders. Defendants typically canceled the Resting Orders in
close temporal proximity to the execution of the Genuine Executed Orders and before the
Resting Spoof Orders were executed.

52. For instance, on May 5, 2010, from 11:22 a.m. CT to 12:30 p.m. CT, Defendants
used the Dynamic Layering Program to place 5 orders totaling 2,500 contracts with a notional
value of $146.3 million. The orders were 1 tick apart, starting 2 ticks from the best asking price.
During this hour-long period, Defendants Ade 107 188-lot and 289-lot sell-side Resting Spoof
Orders. These Resting Spoof Orders amounted to 25,267 contracts. All but four of these orders
were canceled before any execution and the median cancelation time was less than a second.

53. During the Relevant Period, the purpose and intent motivating Defendantsâ
placement of Resting Spoof Orders was to introduce the orders into the E-mini S&P market to
create a false sense of supply and/or demand, induce other market participants to react, and
create an artificial price in the E-mini S&P futures contractâall so that Defendants could profit,
mitigate potential loss, or liquidate positions at more favorable prices than were otherwise
available without the use of the Resting Orders.

5, Defendantsâ Actions on the 2010 Flash Crash Day

54. Defendants aggressively used the Dynamic Layering Program and Resting Spoof
Orders on May 6, 2010, the 2010 Flash Crash Day. On that day, Defendants used the Dynamic
Layering Program for a cumulative time of over 4 hours and 25 minutes, typically placing 6
orders at one time, averaging 2600 contracts. Cumulatively, these orders were modified over
81,000 times, with only 81 lots resulting in executed trades.

55. More specifically, at 11:17 a.m. CT, Defendants turned the Dynamic Layering
Program on for more than 2 consecutive hours, until 1:40 p.m. CT. This was an unusually long

continuous use of the Dynamic Layering Program during the Relevant Period. During this time

16

 
 

period, Defendants utilized the Dynamic Layering Program to place 5 orders, totaling 3,000
contracts. A sixth order was added at around 1:13 p.m. CT, increasing the total to 3,600
contracts.

56. These orders represented approximately $170 million to over $200 million worth
of persistent downward pressure on the E-mini S&P price and, over the next 2 hours, represented
20-29% of the entire sell-side of the order book. The orders were replaced or modified more
than 19,000 times before being canceled at 1:40 p.m. CT. At that time, the order book was
severely imbalanced, and Defendantsâ 3,600 Dynamic Layering Program orders were almost
equal to the entire buy-side of the Order Book.

57. Further, Defendants exacerbated the effects of the Dynamic Layering Program
that day by simultaneously using Resting Spoof Orders. Between 12:33 p.m. CTâ1:45 p.m. CT,
Defendants placed a total of 135 orders with 188 or 289 lots on the sell-side of the Order Book,
totaling 32,046 contracts. Of these 135 188/289-lot orders, 132 orders were canceled without
resulting in execution.

58. May 6, 2010 represented one of Defendantsâ most consistent, numerous and
aggressive use of Spoof Orders during the Relevant Period.

59. On May 6, 2010, Defendantsâ actions contributed to an extreme order book
imbalance in the E-mini S&P market. In their Preliminary Findings Regarding the Events of
May 6, 2010, the CFTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission noted that a significant
imbalance between sell orders and buy orders contributed to a sudden loss of liquidity in the E-
mini S&P market. The report further stated that this loss of liquidity, in conjunction with other

market events, directly contributed to the E-mini S&P price crash.

fj
60. At multiple times on May 6, 2010, Defendants successfully used Spoof Orders to
affect the E-mini S&P price, causing and creating artificial prices. -

6. Other Perfected Manipulation Days

61. Defendants successfully used Spoof Orders to affect the E-mini S&P price,
causing and creating artificial prices throughout the Relevant Period, including multiple times on
at least the following days: April 27, May 4, 5, and 10, 2010; January 28, February 22, March 4,
May 2, July 29, and August 4, 2011; and March 10, 2014.
