LLC, KGW CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, LLC, AND KEVIN G. WHITE

Pursuant to the Memorandum Adopting Report and Recommendation of the United States

Magistrate Judge entered in this matter and Docket Entry 127-1, the court enters the following order.
On July 9, 2013, Plaintiff, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the

âCommissionâ or âCFTCâ), filed a Complaint for Injunctive and Other Equitable Relief and for
Civil Monetary Penalties (âComplaintâ) against Defendants, RFF GP, LLC (âRFF GPâ), KGW
Capital Management, LLC (âKGW Capitalâ), and Kevin G. White (âWhiteâ) (collectively
Defendantsâ) for violations of anti-fraud provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act (âActâ),

7 ULS.C. Â§Â§ | et seq. (2012). The Complaint alleged that from at least September 2011 through
July 2013 (the âRelevant Periodâ), Defendants fraudulently solicited at least $5.8 million from at
least 20 participants in a pooled investment vehicle (âpool participantsâ) and purported hedge

fund, Revelation Forex Fund, LP (âRFFâ), which was established by Defendants for the purpose
Case 4:13-cv-00382-RAS-DDB Document 149 Filed 03/30/15 Page 2 of 24 PagelD #: 2056

of trading in off-exchange agreements, contracts, or transactions in foreign currency (âforexâ) on
a leveraged or margined basis. The Complaint also alleged that Defendants misappropriated
approximately $1.7 million of pool participantsâ funds and that RFF along with other Relief
Defendants, Meridian Propane, LP (âMeridian Propaneâ), and W Corporate Real Estate, LP d/b/a
KGW Real Estate (âKGW Real Estateâ) (collectively âRelief Defendantsâ) received pool
participantsâ funds to which they had no legitimate interest or entitlement.

On July 9, 2013, the court issued an ex parte statutory restraining order (âSROâ) against
Defendants and Relief Defendants. Docket Entry (âD.E.â) 7. On August 12, 2013, the court

II. FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

The court, being fully advised in the premises, finds that there is good cause for the entry
of this Consent Order and that there is no just reason for delay. The court therefore directs the
entry of the following Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, permanent injunction, and equitable
relief pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2012), as set forth herein.

THE PARTIES AGREE AND THE COURT HEREBY FINDS:
A. Findings of Fact
1. The Parties To This Consent Order

14. Plaintiff U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an independent
federal regulatory agency that is charged by Congress with administering and enforcing the Act,
7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1 ef seq. (2012), and the Commission Regulations promulgated thereunder,

17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1.1 ef seg. (2013).

15. Defendant RFF GP, LLC is a Texas company that was formed on or about July

20, 2011. RFF GP is RFFâs general partner. RFF GP has never been registered with the

Commission in any capacity.
Case 4:13-cv-00382-RAS-DDB Document 149 Filed 03/30/15 Page 6 of 24 PagelD #: 2060

16. Defendant KGW Capital Management, LLC is a Texas company that was
formed on or about July 25, 2007. KGW Capita! purported to be âone of the worldâs leading
private investment firmsâ that offered investments in forex through RFF among other
investments. KGW Capital has never been registered with the Commission in any capacity.

17. Defendant Kevin G. White is the manager and director of RFF GP and the
president and CEO of KGW Capital. White was previously registered with the Commission as
an associated person (âAPâ) at Lehman Brothers Inc. (later Shearson Lehman Brothers) from
1981 to 1987, and as an AP at EF Hutton and Company Inc. (later Shearson Lehman Hutton)
from 1987 to 1988.

2. Defendantsâ Misappropriation of Pool Participantsâ Funds

18. During the Relevant Period, pool participants provided Defendants with
approximately $7.4 millionâ either through bank wire transfers to RFFâs bank accounts, which
were controlled by White, or through checks made payable to RFF for purposes of trading forex.
White in turn transferred some of these pool participant funds to his personal bank accounts,
while using other pool participantsâ funds for personal and business expenses. Additionally,
White transferred funds to Relief Defendants, Meridian Propane and KGW Real Estate, which
were entities controlled by White and that had nothing to do with forex trading.

19. Of the approximately $7.4 million invested with RFF during the Relevant Period,
Defendants misappropriated approximately $1.7 million. White used the misappropriated funds
for personal expenses, including a gym membership, retail purchases, meals, travel, a dog

training service, vehicle maintenance, and alimony payments, as well as business expenses

 

? After gaining access to RFFâs records, the Commission and court-appointed receiver

determined that the amount pool participants provided to Defendants is approximately $1.6
million more than the $5.8 million estimated in the Complaint and SRO.

6
Case 4:13-cv-00382-RAS-DDB Document 149 Filed 03/30/15 Page 7 of 24 PagelD #: 2061

including furniture, electronic equipment, and marketing services. In essence, White treated
RFFâs bank accounts as his personal bank account.

20. Defendants concealed their misappropriation of pool participantsâ funds from
prospective pool participants by claiming in their promotional materials that they charged an
âindustry standardâ 2% annual management fee and a 20% annual performance fee, which was
purportedly based on profits. Further, White told prospective pool participants that Defendants
would not be paid unless RFF was profitable. Contrary to Defendantsâ representations, however,
Whiteâs personal expenditures of pool participantsâ funds and those poo! participantsâ funds
transferred to other businesses controlled by him far exceeded the purported 2% annual
management fee. Moreover, Whiteâs misappropriation of pool participantsâ funds continued
despite RFFâs unprofitability.

3. Defendantsâ Material Misrepresentations and Omissions

21. During the Relevant Period, Defendants made a litany of material
misrepresentations that misstated RFFâs profitability and Whiteâs previous brokerage experience,
and material omissions that failed to disclose Defendantsâ misappropriation of pool participantsâ
funds. Defendants made these misrepresentations and omissions through written promotional
materials used to solicit prospective pool participants by depicting purported profitable trading
results that were posted on Defendantsâ two websites, www.revelationforex.com and
www.kgweapital.com. Additionally, White used these same misleading materials to solicit
prospective pool participants at the May 2013 âMoneyShowâ trade show event in Las Vegas,
Nevada.

22. In promotional material entitled âHistorical Performanceâ posted on their

websites and distributed by White at the âMoneyShow,â Defendants claimed positive annualized
Case 4:13-cv-00382-RAS-DDB Document 149 Filed 03/30/15 Page 8 of 24 PagelD #: 2062

returns for RFF ranging from 24.01% to 59.73% for each year between 2009 and 2012. These
claims were false because Defendants did not begin trading forex until September 2011, and
Defendantsâ performance in trading forex on behalf of RFF resulted in losses, not positive
returns. Specifically, Defendants suffered successive losses of $34,000 in 2011 and $933,000 in
2012, for a cumulative loss of approximately $967,000.

23. For 2013, Defendantsâ promotional materials claimed an annualized growth rate
of 32.07% through April 30, 2013, when in actuality RFF lost an additional $433,000 during this
same period. By July 9, 2013, when Defendantsâ and Relief Defendantsâ assets were frozen by
the SRO, RFFâs cumulative trading losses totaled over $2 million.

24. Defendants further solicited prospective pool participants by claiming that RFF
had an âastoundingâ 37.08% (later revised downward to 36.56%) compound annual growth rate
since January 2009, and that an investment of $250,000 in 2009 would have yielded $964,591 as
of April 30, 2013, for a total return of 385.84%. These claims were false. In reality, pool
participants could not invest in RFF until Defendants began trading in September 2011, anda
pool participant who invested in RFF since then and remained invested until April 30, 2013,
would have suffered losses, not a 385.84% gain. White knew that Defendantsâ representations
regarding RFFâs purported profitability since 2009 were false because he formed RFF in 2011
and because he controlled RFFâs trading and bank accounts.

25. Although Defendantsâ trading was consistently unprofitable, Defendantsâ
promotional materials claimed that âRevelation Forex Fund has achieved positive gains in 42 of
the last 52 months (80.77% months with gains) through April 30, 2013.â White told prospective
pool participants at the âMoneyShowâ that RFF had never had two successive losing months.

These claims were false. Through April 30, 2013, RFF was profitable in only 7 of the 20 months
Case 4:13-cv-00382-RAS-DDB Document 149 Filed 03/30/15 Page 9 of 24 PagelD #: 2063

that Defendants were trading, meaning that in only approximately 35% of the months was RFF
profitable â not 80.77% as Defendants claimed. Contrary to Defendantsâ claims, only once was
RFF profitable for two successive months. White knew that the claims he made at the
âMoneyShowâ regarding the purported consistency of RFFâs profits were false because he
controlled RFFâs trading and bank accounts.

26. To lure prospective pool participants to invest, while concealing their trading
losses, Defendants claimed that RFF was recently recognized as the â#2 best performing [forex]
fundâ in the world by EliteForexFunds, which purported to be âThe Definitive Source on The
Worldâs Best Forex Funds.â Defendants solicited prospective pool participants with a chart
stating that the â#2â ranking was based upon âa minimum of 4 years [of] audited resultsâ and
which depicted their fraudulent claims of annual profits for RFF since 2009. These claims were
totally false. Defendantsâ chart showed purported profits for four full years, from 2009 to 2012,
when in fact they only began trading in September 2011, and lost money in both 2011 and 2012.
Further, EliteForexFunds was a sham ranking system manipulated by Defendants to mislead
prospective pool participants through fraudulent claims of âauditedâ results.

27, In their solicitation of pool participants, Defendants touted Whiteâs purported
25-year Wall Street career as including a âlong distinguished tenure at Shearson Loeb Rhodes
and predecessor firms . .. Shearson Lehman Brothers, Shearson Lehman Hutton... .â
Defendantsâ claims were false and contained material omissions. Whiteâs Wall Street career
lasted only approximately seven years and he was fired by both Shearson Lehman Brothers and
its successor firm, Shearson Lehman Hutton. White was subsequently censured and barred by
the New York Stock Exchange for unauthorized trades in customer accounts and making

material misstatements.
Case 4:13-cv-00382-RAS-DDB Document 149 Filed 03/30/15 Page 10 of 24 PagelD #: 2064

28. In connection with Defendantsâ misleading claims that White was a successful
Wall Street broker, Defendants failed to disclose that White filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in
1995 and that several federal tax liens had been filed against him.

29. During the Relevant Period, Defendants failed to disclose to actual and
prospective pool participants the material information that: (1) Defendants misappropriated pool
participantsâ funds; (2) Defendantsâ forex trading had been unprofitable; and (3) White was not
an experienced and successful Wall Street broker.

4, White Controlled RFF GP and KGW Capital

30. During the Relevant Period, White served as an officer of RFF GP and KGW
Capital. White exercised day-to-day control over the business activities of RFF GP and KGW
Capital by opening trading and bank accounts on RFF GPâs and KGW Capitalâs behalf and
serving as the sole signatory on said accounts. Additionally, White was responsible for the
creation of Defendantsâ websites and solicited prospective pool participants on behalf of RFF GP
and KGW Capital. Accordingly, White knew of, and personally controlled RFF GPâs and KGW
Capitalâs activities giving rise to the above-described acts.

B. Conclusions of Law
1. Jurisdiction and Venue

31. This court possesses jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 6c of the

3. Defendants Committed Fraud While Acting as Commodity Pool Operators

purpose of trading in retail forex as described in Section 2(c)(2)(C)(i) of the Act,

(1) misappropriating pool participantsâ funds; (2) misrepresenting RFFâs profitability and
Whiteâs experience as a broker; and (3) failing to disclose material information.

IV. RESTITUTION AND CIVIL MONETARY PENALTY

A. Restitution

47. Defendants shall, jointly and severally, pay restitution in the amount of three
million, three-hundred sixty-five thousand, and eight hundred eight-eight dollars ($3,365,888)
("Restitution Obligation"), plus post-judgment interest, within ten (10) days of the date of entry
of this Consent Order. If the Restitution Obligation is not paid in full within ten (10) days of the
date of entry of this Consent Order, then post-judgment interest shall accrue on the Restitution
Obligation beginning on the date of entry of this Consent Order and shall be determined by using
the Treasury Bill rate prevailing on the date of entry of this Consent Order pursuant to 28 U.S.C.
Â§ 1961 (2012).

48.  Toeffect payment of the Restitution Obligation and the distribution of any
restitution payments to Defendantsâ pool participants, the court appoints Kelly M. Crawford
(ââMonitorâ or âCrawfordâ), the Receiver in this case, as Monitor. The Monitor shall collect

restitution payments from Defendants and make distributions as set forth below. Because

15
Case 4:13-cv-00382-RAS-DDB Document 149 Filed 03/30/15 Page 16 of 24 PagelD #: 2070

Crawford is acting as an officer of this court in performing these services, Crawford shall not be
liable for any action or inaction arising from his appointment as Monitor, other than actions
involving fraud.

49. _ Defendants shall make Restitution Obligation payments under this Consent Order
to the Monitor in the name of the âKGW Receivershipâ account and shall send such Restitution
Obligation payments by electronic funds transfer, or by U.S. postal money order, certified check,
bank cashierâs check, or bank money order, to Kelly M. Crawford, Esq., Scheef & Stone, LLP,
500 North Akard Street, Dallas, Texas 75201, under cover letter that identifies the paying
Defendants and the name and docket number of this proceeding. Defendants shall
simultaneously transmit copies of the cover letter and the form of payment to the Chief Financial
Officer, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st
Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20581, and to Harry E. Wedewer, Division of Enforcement, U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street, NW,
Washington, D.C. 2058].

50.â The Monitor shall oversee the Restitution Obligation and shall have the discretion
to determine the manner of distribution of such funds in an equitable fashion to Defendantsâ pool
participants identified by the Commission or may defer distribution until such time as the
Monitor deems appropriate. In the event that the amount of Restitution Obligation payments to
the Monitor are of a de minimis nature such that the Monitor determines that the administrative
cost of making a distribution to eligible pool participants is impractical, the Monitor may, in his
discretion, treat such restitution payments as civil monetary penalty payments, which the
Monitor shall forward to the Commission following the instructions for civil monetary penalty

payments set forth in Section 1V.B below.

16
Case 4:13-cv-00382-RAS-DDB Document 149 Filed 03/30/15 Page 17 of 24 PagelD #: 2071

51. Defendants shall cooperate with the Monitor as appropriate to provide such
information as the Monitor deems necessary and appropriate to identify Defendantsâ pool
participants to whom the Monitor, in his sole discretion, may determine to include in any plan for
distribution of any Restitution Obligation payments. Defendants shall execute any documents
necessary to release funds that they have in any repository, bank, investment or other financial
institution, wherever located, in order to make partial or total payment toward the Restitution
Obligation.

52. | The Monitor shall provide the Commission at the beginning of each calendar year
with a report detailing the disbursement of funds to Defendantsâ pool participants during the
previous year. The Monitor shall transmit this report under a cover letter that identifies the name
and docket number of this proceeding to the Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20581,
and to Harry E. Wedewer, Division of Enforcement, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20581.

53. Upon the termination of the receivership estate, the National Futures Association
(âNFAâ) shall serve as Monitor (the âPost-Receivership Monitorâ). Because the
Post-Receivership Monitor is acting as an officer of this court in performing these services, NFA
shall not be liable for any action or inaction arising from NFAâs appointment as the
Post-Receivership Monitor, other than actions involving fraud.

54. Upon the termination of the receivership estate, Defendants shall make
Restitution Obligation payments under this Consent Order to the Post-Receivership Monitor in

Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street, NW,
Washington, D.C. 20581.

55. | The amounts payable to each pool participant shall not limit the ability of any
pool participant from proving that a greater amount is owed from Defendants or any other person
or entity, and nothing herein shall be construed in any way to limit or abridge the rights of any
pool participant that exist under state or common law.

56. Pursuant to Rule 71 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, each pool participant
of Defendants who suffered a loss is explicitly made an intended third-party beneficiary of this
Consent Order and may seek to enforce obedience of this Consent Order to obtain satisfaction of
any portion of the restitution amount that has not been paid by Defendants to ensure continued
compliance with any provision of this Consent Order, and to hold Defendants in contempt for
any violations of any provision of this Consent Order.

57. To the extent that any funds accrue to the U.S. Treasury for satisfaction of
Defendantsâ Restitution Obligation, such funds shall be transferred to the Monitor or the
Post-Receivership Monitor for disbursement in accordance with the procedures set forth above.

Obligation concerning any funds paid by Defendants in SEC v. White, No. 4:13-cv-383-RAS-

post-judgment interest, within ten (10) days of the date of entry of this Consent Order. If the
CMP Obligation is not paid in full within ten (10) days of the date of entry of this Consent Order,
post-judgment interest shall accrue on the CMP Obligation beginning on the date of entry of this
Consent Order and shall be determined by using the Treasury Bill rate prevailing on the date of
entry of this Consent Order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1961 (2012).

60. Defendants shall pay their CMP Obligation by electronic funds transfer, U.S.
postal money order, certified check, bank cashierâs check, or bank money order. If payment is to
