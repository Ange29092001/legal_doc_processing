PLAINTIFF'S EX PARTE
EMERGENCY MOTION FOR
STATUTORY RESTRAINING
ORDER, EXPEDITED
DISCOVERY, ORDER TO
SHOW CAUSE REGARDING
PRELIMINARY
INJUNCTION, AND OTHER
EQUITABL RELIEF

Plaintiff, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ), has

filed a Complaint for Permanent Injunction and Other Relief and moved, pursuant

to Section 6c(a) of the Commodity Exchange Act (the âActâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(a)

(2012), for an ex parte statutory restraining order freezing assets, and ordering

Defendant to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not be issued. The

Court has considered the pleadings, declarations, exhibits, and memorandum filed

in support of the Commissionâs request for a statutory restraining order, and finds

that:

1. This Court has jurisdiction over the parties and over the subject matter

of this action pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2012).

Case 3:15-cv-00828 Document il Filed 08/25/15 Page 1 of 15 Pageib # 498
2. Venue lies properly within this District pursuant to Section 6c(e) of
the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§13a-1(e) (2012).

3. There is good cause to believe that Maverick Asset Management,
LLC (âMAMâ), Rodney Scott Phelps (âPhelpsâ) and Jason T. Castenir
(âCastenirâ) (collectively, âDefendantsâ), have engaged in, are engaging in and are
about to engage in acts in violation of 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6b(a)(1)(A)-(C), 60(1), 6m(1)
and 6k(2) (2012), and 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 4.20(b)-(c) (2014).

4. From approximately March 1, 2013 through the present (the
âRelevant Periodâ), Defendants Maverick Asset Management, LLC (âMAMâ), by
and through its employees Rodney Scott Phelps (âPhelpsâ) and Jason T. Castenir
(âCastenirâ), and Phelps and Castenir directly (collectively, âDefendantsâ)
defrauded at least two members of the public (âpool participantsâ) out of
approximately $1.2 million in connection with pooled investments in exchange-
traded commodity futures contracts. During the Relevant Period, Defendants
misappropriated over $800,000 of their pool participantsâ funds, made material
misrepresentations and omissions to existing and prospective pool participants,
provided pool participants with false account statements, and operated the pool
illegally. There is good cause to believe that immediate and irreparable damage to
the Courtâs ability to grant effective final relief for pool participants in the form of

monetary redress will occur from the sale, transfer, assignment, or other

2
Mase 3:15-cv-00828 Document il Filed O8/25/15 Page 2 of 15 PagelD & 499
disposition by Defendant of assets or records unless Defendants are immediately
restrained and enjoined by Order of the Court.

5. There is good cause for the Court to freeze assets owned, controlled,
managed, or held by or on behalf of, or for the benefit of Defendants, including
assets in accounts held by Maverick Investment Holdings, LLC (âMIHâ).

6. There is good cause for entry of an order prohibiting Defendants, their
agents, servants, employees, assigns, attorneys, and persons in active concert or
participation with Defendants, including any successor thereof, from destroying
records and/or denying agents of the Commission access to inspect and copy
records to ensure that Commission representatives have immediate and complete
access to those books and records.

7. There is good cause for the Plaintiff to conduct expedited discovery in
order to determine the full extent of Defendantsâ alleged wrongdoing, locate
Defendantsâ other pool participants, identify pool participant funds and other assets
of Defendants and clarify the source and whereabouts of various funds.

8. Absent the entry of this statutory restraining order, Defendants are
likely to dissipate or transfer assets and destroy business records.

9. This is a proper case for granting an ex parte statutory restraining

order to preserve the status quo, protect pool participants from loss and damage,

3
