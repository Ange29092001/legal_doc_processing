A. Findings of Fact
The Parties to this Consent Order

14,â Plaintiff U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the âCFTCâ or
âCommissionâ) is an independent federal regulatory agency charged by Congress with the
responsibility for administering and enforcing the Commodity Exchange Act (the âActâ),

7 U.S.C. Â§ 1 ef seg. (2012), and the Regulations promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1.1 et seg.
(2014).

15. Defendant Futures International LLC (âFTâ) is an Illinois limited liability
company formed in August 2004 with a primary business address at 190 South LaSalle Street,
Suite 1720, Chicago, Illinois, FI is an Introducing Broker (âIBâ) that trades agricultural futures
and options on the CBOT floor of the CBOT and on Globex, CBOTâs electronic trading
platform, including futures contracts in soybeans, soybean meal, soybean oil, and the soybean
âcrushâ spread (a spread trade involving buying or selling soybean futures contracts and
simultaneously selling (or buying) soybean meal and soybean oil futures contracts), During the
relevant period (i.e., January 2009 through November 2012), FI was one of (if not the) largest
participant(s) in the crush market on the CBOT floor. FI is a CBOT member firm and has been
registered with the Commission as an IB since November 2004.

16. Defendant Amedeo Cerrone is a resident of St. Charles, Illinois and has served
as FIâs Chief Operating Officer since its inception, Among other general and operational duties, _
Cerrone has been responsible for interviewing, hiring, and supervising Fl employees, He has
been registered with the Commission as an Associated Person (âAPâ) of FI and has been an FI

Principal since November 2004. Cerrone has also been registered as a floor broker since

February 2003.

ilure to Maintain Complete and Accurate B 5 of Futu ransactions

17. Section 4g(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6g(a) (2012), provides that every person
registered as a futures commission merchant, IB, floor broker, or floor trader is required to keep
books and records pertaining to transactions and positions of their customers and commodities
for future delivery, and to make such records available for inspection by the Commission.

18. Regulation 1.35(a), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.35(a) (2013), requires IBs to keep âfull,
complete, and systematic records, together with all pertinent data. and memoranda, of all
transactions relating to its business of dealing in commodity futures...â Regulation 1.35(a-1),
17 C.F.R, Â§ 1.35(a-1) (2014), further requires that any IB receiving a customer order âshall
immediately upon receipt thereof prepare a written record of the orderâ and shall record, by
timestamp or other device, the date and time, to the nearest minute, that the order is received.

19, Regulation 1.31, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1.31 (2014), provides that âall books and records
required to be kept by the Act or by these regulations shall be kept for a period of five years from
the date thereof and shall be readily accessible during the first 2 years of the 5-year period.â

20. âIn order to preserve an audit trail for the exchange and its members, floor brokers
and floor traders are also required to record the time bracket on each executed order ticket, The
time bracket is a letter or symbol corresponding to specific fifteen-minute time increments within
a trading session. The bracketing system helps to pinpoint within a fifteen-minute window the
time that a trade occurred.

21. Beginning in at least 2009 and continuing until 2012, FI failed to record all
customer orders immediately upon receipt and further failed to retain full, complete, and

systematic records of all transactions relating to its business of dealing in commodity futures.
22. Instead of completing order tickets documenting order instructions at the time the
order was received, FI employees often recorded order information only after the order was
executed or âfilled.â

23. To ensure the timestamps on FI floor order tickets did not conflict with other
timing information collected and maintained by the CME, FI employees timestamped blank
order tickets throughout each dayâs trading session. FI employees were then able to select pre-
timestamped order tickets reflecting a time that appeared consistent with the orderâs execution
time, regardless of when the order was received.

24. Because of its failure to immediately document orders in accordance with
Regulation 1.35(a-1), as well as its use of pre-timestamped order tickets, some of FIâs order
tickets bore false information regarding the time at which orders were received.

25. Cerrone knew FI employees were pre-timestamping blank order tickets and using
those tickets to document trades after execution,

26. During the relevant time period, FI employees communicated electronically and
on personal devices about FI transactions involving commodity futures and/or options, including
by use of instant messages, FI, did not, however, retain all instant messages that related to its
business involving commodity futures transactions,

27. Cerrone knew FI employees conducted firm business through electronic
communications and he was responsible for collecting relevant instant messages until at least
August 2011.

28. FI did not retain all of its instant messages involving commodity futures

transactions during the relevant period.
29,  FIâs inability to produce full, complete, and accurate order tickets and instant
messages resulted in an incomplete and unreliable audit trail that hindered the Commissionâs
ability to investigate violations of the Act and Regulations.

Submissio. False t

30. Section 9(a)(4) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13(a)(4) (2012), prohibits:
Any person willfully to falsify, conceal, or cover up by any trick, scheme, or

artifice a material fact, make any false, fictitious, or fraudulent statements or
representations, or make or use any false writing or document knowing the same
to contain any false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry to a registered
entity, board of trade, or futures association designed or registered under this Act
acting in furtherance of its official duties under this Act.

31. Asaresult of FIâs order ticket practices described above, FI submitted certain
order tickets with false information to the clearing futures commission merchant (âFCMâ) for
keypunching and that information was transmitted to CME Clearing.

32. FI knew that information from its order tickets would be keypunched and
subsequently transmitted to CME Clearing.

Unauthorized Tr:

33. Regulation 166.2, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 166.2 (2014), prohibits an IB or any of its
associated persons from effecting a transaction on behalf of a customer without first obtaining
from the customer or the person designated to control the account: (1) â[t}he precise commodity
interest to be purchased or sold; and (2) [t]he exact amount of the commodity interest to be
purchased or soldâ if the customer has not executed a written power of attorney.

34. Throughout the relevant time period, FI did not obtain any written powers of

attorney to trade its customer accounts.
Mase: lii4-cv-O787? Document # 32 Fileck O9/21/15 Page S of 18 Pagelt #222
(

35. FI nonetheless executed trades on occasion without first receiving instructions
from its customers as to the precise commodity interest to be purchased and the amount to be
purchased.

36. In some instances, FI employees executed or directed the execution of trades
based on customer order instructions that failed to specify the contract month the customer
wanted to trade and/or the amount of the commodity interest to be purchased.

37, At other times during the relevant time period, FI employees executed trades
without knowing what customer, if any, would eventually accept the trade. One FI employee
contacted customers after execution to determine whether they wanted a trade attributed to their
account.

38. | On occasions where one FI employee was unable to find a customer willing to
accept an executed trade, that employee assigned the trade (or directed another FI employee to
assign the trade) to an account designated for error trades or to a personal account maintained by
him.

39,  FIâs improper use of pre-timestamped floor order tickets enabled the allocation of
trades subsequent to their execution.

Failure to Supervise

40. Regulation 166.3, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 166.3 (2013), requires:

Each Commission registrant, except an associate person who has no supervisory
duties, must diligently supervise the handling by its partners, officers, employees
and agents (or other persons occupying a similar status or performing a similar
function) of all commodity interest accounts carried, operated, advised or
introduced by the registrant and all other activities of its partners, officers,
employees, and agents (or other persons occupying a similar status or performing
a similar function) relating to its business as a registrant.

41. | Throughout the relevant time period, FI and Cerrone were both registered with the

Commission, and Cerrone had supervisory duties at FI.

 
Case: idÃ©d-cv-07877 Document @ 32 Filed: OG/21/15 Page 10 of 18 Pageld #223
|

42, Notwithstanding their supervisory obligations, FI and Cerrone: (1) failed to
establish written policies and procedures governing trading floor operations until at least
September 2012; (ii) failed to provide adequate training to employees despite hiring some
individuals without industry experience; and (ili) failed to implement adequate policies and
practices to ensure compliance with the Act and Regulations, including the practices described
above.

43, For example, prior to September 2012, FI did not maintain written policies or
procedures governing its trading or floor operations, including order intake, preparation of order
tickets, handling error trades, trade execution, priority of customer orders, and recordkeeping.

44, â FIâs compliance officer at the time was not experienced in floor operations, did
not observe FIâs trading floor practices and did not review FIâs policies or procedures relating to
order ticket processes. |

45. Instead, another FI employee was identified as responsible for ensuring
compliance with Commission Rules and Regulations regarding trading desk activities and the
order ticketing process, but that employee did not know that she bore such responsibilities and
she was principally involved in FIâs practice of pre-timestamping floor order tickets throughout
the trading day.

| 46. Throughout the relevant time period, neither FI nor Cerrone acted diligently to
ensure that FI employees were aware of, and complied with, the requirements of the Act and
Regulations, and neither diligently supervised FIâs trading floor and order ticket processes.
B. Conclusions of Law

Jurisdiction and Venue

47. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 6c of the Act,

7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2012), which provides that whenever it appears to the CFTC that any person

10
Case: Ddd-cyv-0787? Docurnent 4: 32 Fiiec: OOf/21/15 Page 11 of 18 Pageip a:224
(

has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a violation of

any provision of the Act or any rule, regulation, or order promulgated thereunder, the CFTC may
bring an action in the proper district court of the United States against such person to enjoin such
act or practice, or to enforce compliance with the Act, or any rule, regulation or order thereunder,

48, Venue properly lies with this Court pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act, 7 U.S.C,
Â§ 13a-1(e) (2012), because the Defendants reside in this jurisdiction and the acts and practices in
violation of the Act occurred within this District.

49, â_ By the conduct described in paragraphs 17 through 32 above, FI, through
employees acting on its behalf, violated Section 9(a)(4) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13(a)(4) (2012),
by willfully submitting order tickets for keypunching to CME Clearing with false timestamp
information to a registered entity, board of trade, or futures association.

50. By the conduct described in paragraphs 17 through 29 above, FI, through
employees acting on its behalf, violated Section 4g(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6(a) (2012), and
Regulations 1.31 and 1.35(a) by failing to maintain for the requisite period full, complete, and
systematic records of all transactions relating to its business of dealing in commodity futures,
including, but not limited to, its order tickets and instant messages.

51, Cerrone controlled FI and did not act in good faith or knowingly induced, directly
or indirectly, the acts constituting FIâs recordkeeping violations. Specifically, FIâs violations of
Section 4g(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6(a) (2012), and Regulations 1.31 and 1.35(a). Cerrone is
therefore liable for those violations as a controlling person pursuant to Section 13(b) of the Act,
7 USS.C. Â§ 13(c)(b) (2012),

52. By the conduct described in paragraphs 17 through 29 above, FI, through

employees and principals acting on its behalf, violated Section 4g(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6(a)

11
 

(2012), and Regulation 1.35(a-1) by failing to prepare written records of orders immediately

upon receipt, and instead documenting orders later in the day, at times after execution, and often
using pre-timestamped order tickets.

53, By the conduct described in paragraphs 17 through 39 above, FI, through an
employee and principal acting on its behalf, violated Regulation 166.2, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 166.2 (2014),
by placing orders without obtaining specific information from customers regarding the quantity
and/or the precise commodity interest to be purchased or sold.

54. By the conduct described in paragraphs 17 through 36 above, FI, through
employees and principals acting on its behalf, and Cerrone violated Regulation 166.3, 17 C.F.R.
Â§ 166.3 (2014), by, among other things: (i) failing to establish written policies and procedures
governing trading floor operations until at least September 201 1; (ii) failing to provide adequate
training to employees despite hiring some individuals without industry experience; and
(iii) failing to implement adequate policies and practices and/or diligently supervise FI
employees to ensure compliance with the Act and Regulations.

55. Cerrone is a registrant with supervisory responsibilities at Fl. Cerrone controlled
FI and did not act in good faith or knowingly induced, directly or indirectly, the acts and/or
omissions constituting FIâs violations of Regulation 166.3, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 166.3 (2014), and is
therefore liable for those violations directly and as a controlling person pursuant to Section 13(b) |
of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13(c)(b) (2012).

56. Because the foregoing acts, omissions, and failures of FI employees and
principals occurred within the scope of their employment, office, or agency, FI is liable for those

acts, omissions, and failures constituting violations of the Act and Regulations pursuant to

12

 
Case: dild-cv-07877? Document # 32 Filed: OO/21/15 Page 18 of 18 Pagell 4226
