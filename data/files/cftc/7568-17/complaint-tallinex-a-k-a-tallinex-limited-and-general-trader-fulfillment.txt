GENERAL TRADER FULFILLMENT,

Defendants.

 

Plaintiff, Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ or âCFTCââ), by its
attorneys, alleges as follows:

I. SUMMARY

1. On October 18, 2010, the CFTC adopted new regulations implementing certain
provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (âDodd-
Frankââ) with respect to the offer and sale of off-exchange foreign currency (âforexââ) transactions
and the need for entities marketing such transactions to register with the Commission. Pursuant
to Section 2(c)(2)(C)(ii1)(1)(aa) of the Commodity Exchange Act (âthe Actâ) 7 U.S.C.

Â§ 2(c)(2)(C) (11) (1) (aa)(2012), and Commission Regulation (âRegulationâ) 5.3(a)(6)(i), 17 C.F.R.
Â§ 5.3(a)(6)(i)(2016), an entity must be registered with the Commission as a retail foreign
exchange dealer (âRFEDââ) if, with certain exceptions not applicable here, it solicits or accepts
orders for leveraged, margined or financed forex transactions from persons who are not eligible
contract participants (ânon-ECPsâ or âretail customersââ) to which it is or offers to be the

counterparty.
Case 2:17-cv-00483-DN Document 2 Filed 05/30/17 Page 2 of 20

2. Beginning in at least September 2012 and continuing to at least September 2016
(the ârelevant periodâ), Defendant Tallinex a/k/a Tallinex Limited (âTallinexââ), an off-shore
Estonian company, has solicited or accepted orders from non-ECPs located in the United States
in connection with leveraged or margined forex transactions, to which it is or offers to be the
counterparty, without being registered with the CFTC as an RFED, in violation of Section
2(c)(2)(C)G1)(1)(aa) of the Act and Regulation 5.3(a)(6)G). To date, Tallinex has solicited and
accepted at least $1.5 million from U.S. customers.

3. Further, in the course of soliciting retail forex customers, Tallinex made
fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions of material fact and engaged in fraudulent and
deceptive business practices, in violation of Sections 4b(a)(2)(A) and (C) and 6(c)(1) of the Act,
7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6b(a)(2)(A) and (C) and 9(1) of the Act (2012), and Regulations 5.2(b)(1) and (3),
5.5 and 180.1, 17. C.F.R. Â§Â§ 5.2(b)(1) and (3), 5.5 and 180.1 (2016).

4. Also during the relevant period, Defendant General Trader Fulfillment (ââGTPââ)
has operated as an introducing broker (âIBâ) without being registered with the Commission in
violation of Section 4d(g) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6d(g) (2012), and Regulation 5.1((1),

17 C.F.R. Â§ 5.10@)(1) (2016), by soliciting and accepting, on behalf of Tallinex, orders for retail
forex transactions from U.S. resident non-ECP customers.

5. By virtue of this conduct and the further conduct described herein, Defendants
Tallinex and GTF (collectively âDefendantsââ) have engaged, are engaging, or are about to
engage in acts and practices in violation of the Act and the Regulations.

6. Accordingly, pursuant to Sections 2(c)(2) and 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 8Â§ 2(c)(2)
and 13a-1 (2012), the Commission brings this action to enjoin Defendantsâ unlawful acts and

practices and to compel their compliance with the Act and the Regulations, and to further enjoin
Case 2:17-cv-00483-DN Document 2 Filed 05/30/17 Page 3 of 20

Defendants from engaging in certain activity, including, soliciting or accepting orders for forex
transactions from non-ECP U.S. customers and offering to be the counterparty to customersâ
forex transactions, without being registered with the Commission.

7. In addition, the Commission seeks civil monetary penalties and remedial ancillary
relief, including, but not limited to, trading and registration bans, disgorgement, pre- and post-
judgment interest, and such other relief as the Court may deem necessary and appropriate.

8. Unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, Defendants likely will continue to
engage in the acts and practices alleged in this Complaint and similar acts and practices, as more
fully described below.

I. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

9. Section 6c(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(a), authorizes the Commission to seek
injunctive relief against any person whenever it shall appear to the Commission that such person
has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a violation of
the Act or any rule, regulation, or order thereunder.

10. The Commission has jurisdiction over the conduct and transactions at issue in this
case pursuant to Sections 2(c)(2) and 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 2(c)(2) and 13a-1.

11. Venue properly lies with the Court pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
Â§ 13a-1(e), because Defendants transact business in this District and certain transactions, acts,
practices, and courses of business alleged in this Complaint occurred, are occurring, and/or are
about to occur within this District.

by rule, regulation or order shall determine, from soliciting and accepting from retail customers

seller and a buyer who have the ability to deliver and accept delivery.

16. Section 4d(g) of the Act, 7 U.S.C Â§ 6d(g), prohibits any person from operating as
an IB unless registered as such with the Commission.

18. Regulations 5.3(a)(5)G) and 5.1()(1), 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 5.3(a)(5)@) and 5.1091),

by the individual.â Section 1a(18)(xi) of the Act; 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1a(18)(xi). Individuals who do not
meet these criteria are non-ECPs. Tallinexâs customers are typically non-ECPs â 7.e., retail
customers.

Anti-Fraud Provisions of the Act

20. Sections 4b(a)(2)(A) and (C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6b(a)(2)(A) and (C), in
relevant part, make it unlawful for any person, in or in connection with any order to make, or the
making of, any contract of sale of any commodity for future delivery that is made, or to be made,
for, on behalf of, or with any other person, other than on or subject to the rules of a designated
contract market: (A) to cheat or defraud or attempt to cheat or defraud the other person; or (C)
willfully to deceive or attempt to deceive the other person by any means whatsoever in regard to

act of agency performed, with respect to any order or contact for, on behalf of, or with the other

any commodity in interstate commerce, any manipulative, deceptive device or contrivance in
contravention of such rules and regulations as the Commission shall promulgate. Pursuant to

Case 2:17-cv-00483-DN Document 2 Filed 05/30/17 Page 6 of 20

broadly prohibit any person, directly or indirectly, in connection with any swap, contract of sale

rules of any registered entity, to intentionally or recklessly: (1) use or employ, or attempt to use
or employ, any manipulative device, scheme, or artifice to defraud; (2) make, or attempt to make,
any untrue or misleading statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary

engage, in any act, practice, or course of business, which operates or would operate as a fraud or
deceit upon any person.

22. Section 2(c)(2)(C)(1)(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.Â§ 2(c)(2)(C)ayC1), makes Sections

retail forex transactions.

Mandatory Disclosure Statement to Retail Forex Customers

account unless they first furnish customers with a written disclosure statement that provides

back from the customer a signed acknowledgment that the customer received and understood the
disclosure statement. Tallinex does not provide this disclosure statement to all of its U.S. retail

forex customers.

V.
FACTS
A. Tallinexâs Operations
25. Tallinex operates a website at www.tallinex.com and also operates an introducing

broker program whereby companies, such as GTF, introduce forex trading accounts to Tallinex
and receive commissions on revenue generated by the accountsâ trading activity.

26. At least during the relevant time period, Tallinex solicited and accepted funds and
orders from non-ECP, U.S. resident customers to trade leveraged forex contracts.

27. Customers can open trading accounts by submitting information online through
Tallinexâs website. During the relevant period, the Tallinex website, in the frequently asked
questions section, stated, ââTallinex welcomes residents of the U.S... . and provides them with
the same leverage and hedging facilities as non-U.S. ... residents.â Further, Tallinexâs online
application contains a drop down menu for the applicant to select his or her âcountryâ and the
U.S. is one of the choices. The online application also allows a customer to select a currency for
his or her account, and one of the two available currencies is the U.S. dollar.

28. In or around September 2016, Tallinex changed its website to state that it does not
accept U.S. customers. However, on information and belief, Tallinex still solicits and accepts
funds from U.S. customers.

29. Tallinexâs online application does not solicit information concerning whether
prospective customers are ECPs and it fails to inquire whether a prospective customer has the
ability or the business need to accept foreign currency into his or her bank account. Tallinex
permits customers to open forex trading accounts with a minimum initial deposit of 100
EUR/USD. Tallinexâs website states that its ECN-Micro account is âdesigned for traders new to

the [f]orex market, and those needing to trade smaller volumes.â

_7-
Case 2:17-cv-00483-DN Document 2 Filed 05/30/17 Page 8 of 20

30. Tallinex determines the âspreadâ for the forex contracts it offers to customers.
Tallinex offers its customers variable spreads averaging between 0.5 and 2.5 pips (the measuring
mechanism for price changes in forex contracts per contract such as EUR/USD (Euros versus
U.S. dollars). Tallinex therefore acts as the counterparty to its customersâ contract.

31. Tallinex offers its non-ECP customers forex contracts with leverage of up to
1:1000. This means that a customer can increase its trading position by buying or selling up to
1000 times the amount of funds he or she has invested. Thus, for example, a Tallinex customer
may trade up to $1,000,000 notional value in foreign currencies with a $1,000 deposit, and a
customer with $10,000 invested may trade up to $10,000,000 in foreign currencies. This
spectacularly high degree of leverage means that even a small price movement can produce large
losses in relation to the customerâs initial deposit and can result in customers rapidly losing their
funds and being unable to ever recover from a losing trade.

32. Tallinexâs online account application does not require that the customer state
whether or not the customer has the ability to deliver and accept delivery in connection with the
customerâs lines of business, which is one of the prerequisites to qualify as an ECP. In fact, with
forex accounts being offered for as little as LOOEUR/USD, Tallinex is specifically soliciting
customers that typically could never qualify as ECPs.

33. Tallinexâs forex contracts neither result in delivery within two days nor create an
enforceable obligation to deliver between a seller and a buyer who have the ability to deliver and
accept delivery, respectively, in connection with their lines of business. Rather, these forex
contracts are ultimately offset without anyone making or taking delivery of actual currency (or

facing an obligation to do so).
Case 2:17-cv-00483-DN Document 2 Filed 05/30/17 Page 9 of 20

B. Tallinexâs Solicitation Fraud

34. Defendant Tallinex fraudulently solicits U.S. retail forex customers by making
false and misleading misrepresentations of material fact and omitting material information,
including but not limited to: (a) falsely representing that Tallinex is lawfully doing business in the
United States; (b) misrepresenting and omitting the likelihood of profit and risk of loss involved
in trading their forex contracts; (c) falsely and misleadingly representing the safety of customer
funds in the event of Tallinexâs financial collapse (i.e., counterparty risk).

35. Defendant Tallinex made these false and misleading misrepresentations of material
fact and omitted material information during the relevant period on its website, in correspondence
and discussions with retail forex customers, and in social media sites available to the general
public, among other places.

36. Defendant Tallinex has falsely represented to U.S. customers that it is lawfully
doing business in the U.S. by using at least one domestic IB, GTF, to solicit U.S. customer
accounts on Tallinexâs behalf, by stating on its website that it âwelcomes residents of the U.S.â

37. Further, in the course of soliciting U.S. customers, Tallinex misrepresents and
omits material facts regarding the likelihood of profit and the risk of loss associated with trading
Tallinexâs forex contracts.

38. Specifically Tallinexâs website represents that money managers who trade its
forex contacts for customers made purported profits of 162.29% in a little over a year [and] up to
1301.10% in a little over a two-year period. Tallinex promotes these extraordinary profits to
create the misleading impression that forex investments made with it are likely to be profitable
for the specific purpose of increasing its number of customer accounts. However, the website
fails to disclose the likelihood of profits and risk of loss in trading its forex contracts. For

example, it does not disclose the percentages of retail forex accounts that are profitable and not
Case 2:17-cv-00483-DN Document 2 Filed 05/30/17 Page 10 of 20

profitable. By acting as an RFED, Tallinex has a duty to disclose this information under
Regulation 5.5 in order to give a balanced and realistic view of the results of trading its forex
contracts.

39, Tallinex also does not provide all customers with a risk disclosure statement that
warns customers of the risk of rapid losses using leveraged trading. By acting as an RFED,
Tallinex has a duty to disclose this information under Regulation 5.5 in order to give a balanced
and realistic view of the results of trading its forex contracts with leverage.

AO. Tallinex has knowingly or recklessly made these material misrepresentations and
omissions. Tallinex has actual profit and loss history in its possession, but failed to disclose this
balanced information to customers and potential custormers while touting extraordinary profits,
including profits of between 162.29% and 1301.10%. Accordingly, Tallinex made these
misrepresentations knowingly or recklessly.

41. Tallinex also misrepresents to customers that their funds are segregated,
suggesting that customers are protected from risk events such as Tallinexâs financial collapse.
This representation, which Tallinex posts on its website, is false. On information and belief,
Tallinex does not maintain client funds separate from company funds, and in the event of
Tallinexâs default or bankruptcy customersâ funds would be lost.

42. Infact, the written disclosure statement prescribed in Regulation 5.5 warns that
RFEDs must state that the RFED may commingle customer funds with the RFEDâs own
operating funds, use them for other purposes, and in the event of the RFEDâs bankruptcy any
funds the RFED is holding for the customer, including any amounts owed to the customer, may

be treated as an unsecured creditorâs claim even if the customer accounts are segregated.

C. GTFâs Operations

43. GTF solicits U.S. customers to open forex trading accounts at Tallinex as part of
Tallinexâs âIntroducing Broker Program.â

44. GTF solicits these U.S. customers through a network of salespersons that develop
websites that promote GTF. These salespersons also place promotional material in web-based
classified ad companies. GTF claims in its promotional material, and to customers who express
an interest in opening a forex account, to have a proprietary trading system that, if its
recommendations are followed, would result in profitable forex trading.

45. When a customer contacts GTF to trade forex, GTF typically provides the
customer with a âcoach,â who is a paid member of GTF, and who GTF claims will teach the
customer how to trade forex profitably using a hypothetical account.

46. After the GTF âcoachâ and the customer complete hypothetical trading sessions,
GTF staff, including but not limited to the GTF âcoaches,â refer the customer to Tallinex to open
a live forex account to begin trading.

47. GTF receives commissions for introducing customers to Tallinex to open forex
accounts and receives commissions on the revenue generated by the customersâ trading.

48. Since approximately September 2012, GTF has referred at least thirty U.S.
customers who opened forex trading accounts at Tallinex.

disclosure statement.

(il)

(iii)

the total number of non- discretionary retail forex customer
accounts maintained by the retail foreign exchange dealer;

the percentage of accounts that were profitable during the equarter;
and

the percentage of such accounts that were not profitable during the

a Risk Disclosure Statement warning of the financial losses that can inccur
using leverage, conflicts of interests and other risks. Specifically, RFEDs
must disclose in writing, in all capital letters, that:

(i)

(il)

(iii)

(iv)

(v)

the RFEDâs trading is not on a regulated market or exchange and
customersâ funds have no regulatory protection;

because of leverage and other risks, customers can rapidly lose all
of their funds;

the RFED, if serving as the counterparty, has a direct financial
conflict of interest with the customer because when the customer
loses money trading, the counterparty dealer is making money on
such trades;

the RFED may commingle customersâ funds with its own
operating funds or use them for other purposes; and

in the event that the RFED becomes bankrupt, funds the dealer is
holding for customers, in addition to funds owed to customers
whether or not any assets are maintained in separate deposit
accounts by the dealer, may be treated as an unsecured creditorâs
claim.

Regulation 5.5 also requires that the RFED receives back from the retail forex

customer a signed and dated acknowledgement that the customer received and understood the

Tallinex typically did not provide its U.S. retail forex customers with a disclosure

statement that comports with these requirements. Therefore, Tallinex violated Regulation 5.5.

Each retail forex account that Tallinex opened without providing customers with a

written disclosure statement that includes the information set forth in paragraphs 65-67 above, is

alleged as a separate and distinct violation of Regulation 5.5.
