ECF CASE
Plaintiff,
COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE
V. AND OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF
AND FOR CIVIL MONETARY
DOMINICK VINCENT CARDUCCI and PENALTIES UNDER THE
VOS CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, LLC, COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT

AND COMMISSION REGULATIONS
Defendants.

 

 

Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCFTCâ or âCommissionâ), by and
through its attorneys, alleges as follows:

I. SUMMARY

1. From at least August 2016 through in or about September 2018 (the âRelevant
Periodâ), Dominick Vincent Carducci, a/k/a Dominick V. Carducci (âCarducciâ), individually
and as agent and principal of VOS Capital Management, LLC (âVOS Capitalâ) (collectively
Defendantsâ), operated a fraudulent scheme in which they solicited, accepted and
misappropriated funds for a pooled investment vehicle in off-exchange leveraged or margined
foreign currency exchange (âforexâ) contracts.

2. Carducci, as an officer and agent of VOS Capital, knowingly made fraudulent and
material misrepresentations and omissions, in both conversations and written communications,
about his forex trading and returns to persuade at least thirty individuals (âPool Participantsâ) to
transfer at least $1.1 million to Defendants for the purpose of participating in a pooled forex

investment vehicle.

3. To entice prospective Pool Participants, Defendants knowingly and falsely
represented, among other things, that Defendants had made large profits for themselves and Pool
Participants from trading forex; that Defendants maintained a forex trading account with a
registered foreign exchange dealer that had $12 million under Defendantsâ management; that
Defendants would trade forex on behalf of Pool Participants; that Pool Participants would realize
profits of up to 18% per month on their investments without losses; and that upon request Pool
Participants could withdraw the funds they had invested.

4. Defendants failed to trade Pool Participantsâ funds as promised and, instead,
misappropriated most of their money. Upon Defendantsâ direction, Pool Participants deposited
their funds into Defendant VOS Capitalâs bank account. Thereafter, Defendants used the
majority of those funds to pay Carducciâs personal expenses, and to support Carducciâs lavish
lifestyle by, among other things, acquiring luxury automobiles and paying for international
travel. The remainder of the funds was paid to some Pool Participants, in the manner of a Ponzi
scheme.

5. By virtue of this conduct and the conduct further described herein, Defendants
have engaged, are engaging, or are about to engage in acts and practices in violation of Sections
4b(a)(2)(A)-(C) and 40(1)(A)-(B) of the Commodity Exchange Act (âActâ), 7 U.S.C.

8Â§ 6b(a)(2)(A)-(C), 60(1)(A)-(B) (2012), and Commission Regulation (âRegulationâ) 5.2(b)(1)-
(3) (2018), 17 C.F.R. Â§5.2(b)(1)-(3) (2018), which prohibit fraud in connection with forex
transactions and fraud by a commodity pool operator (âCPOâ).

6. In addition to the above-described fraudulent conduct, Defendant VOS Capital
acted at all times during the Relevant Period as a CPO by operating or soliciting funds for a

pooled investment vehicle that is not an eligible contract participant (âECPâ) and that engages in

retail forex transactions, without being registered with the Commission as a CPO, as required by
the Act and Regulations. Specifically, Defendant VOS Capitalâs failure to register as a CPO
violated Sections 2(c)(2)(C)(@i1)()(cc) and 4m(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 2(c)(2)(C) Gi) (cc),
6m(1) (2012), and Regulation 5.3(a)(2)q), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 5.3(a)(2)G) (2018).

7. Similarly, Defendant Carducci solicited funds for participation in a pooled
investment vehicle for the purpose of trading in off-exchange leveraged or margined forex
contracts, while associated with Defendant VOS Capital as an officer, employee, or agent,
without being registered with the Commission as an associated person (âAPâ) of VOS Capital, as
required by the Act and Regulations. Specifically, Defendant Carducciâs failure to register as an
AP of a CPO violated Sections 2(c)(2)(C)Gu)()(cc) and 4k(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.

Â§Â§ 2(c)(2)(C)ai)()(cc), 6k(2) (2012), and 17 C.F.R. Â§ 5.3(a)(2) Gi).

8. Accordingly, pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2012), the
Commission brings this action to enjoin Defendantsâ unlawful acts and practices and to compel
their compliance with the Act and the Regulations promulgated thereunder. In addition, the
Commission seeks civil monetary penalties and remedial ancillary relief, including, but not
limited to, trading and registration bans, restitution, disgorgement, rescission, pre- and post-
judgment interest, and such other and further relief as the Court may deem necessary or
appropriate.

9. Unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, Defendants will likely continue to
engage in the acts and practices alleged in this Complaint and similar acts and practices, as

described below.

II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

10. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Â§1331 (2012)
(codifying federal question jurisdiction) and 28 U.S.C. Â§1345 (2012) (providing that U.S. district
courts have original jurisdiction over civil actions commenced by the United States or by any
agency expressly authorized to sue by Act of Congress). In addition, Section 6c of the Act,
7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2012), provides that the U.S. district courts have jurisdiction to hear actions
brought by the Commission for injunctive relief or to enforce compliance with the Act whenever
it shall appear to the Commission that a person has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in
any act or practice constituting a violation of any provision of the Act, or any rule, regulation, or
order thereunder.

11. The CFTC has jurisdiction over the forex solicitations and transactions at issue in
this case pursuant to Section 2(c)(2)(C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(c)(2)(C)(2012).

12. Venue properly lies with this Court pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
Â§ 13a-1(e) (2012), because Defendants transact or transacted business in this District, and certain
transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business alleged in this Complaint occurred, are
occurring, or are about to occur in this District. Specifically, several of the defrauded Pool
Participants reside in and were solicited in this District, and Defendants represented to Pool
Participants that their funds would be maintained in a trading account at a registered foreign
exchange dealer located in New York, N.Y.

Vv. FACTS
A. Defendantsâ Fraudulent Solicitation and False Statements

23. During the Relevant Period, Defendants fraudulently solicited at least $1.1 million

from at least thirty non-ECP Pool Participants, who were Defendant Carducciâs friends, family
on a8 nag RE a et rs Â« per i Py rey iy
Ay em So 4 on : % : : g ON PA EN om Loe : : :

PA ada ke Sa AP RP ad ah fe AP ROLE SB DE eo oF rf

members, acquaintances, and members of the public, for the purpose of trading off-exchange
leveraged or margined forex contracts on behalf of the Pool Participants.

24. Throughout the Relevant Period, Defendants falsely and fraudulently represented
to Pool Participants that Defendants used Pool Participantsâ funds profitably to trade forex, that
Pool Participants would realize large monthly profits on their investments without losses, and
that upon request Pool Participants could withdraw their funds.

25. In fact, Defendants did not conduct forex trading on behalf of Pool Participants,
but instead intentionally misappropriated Participantsâ funds for Defendantsâ own benefit and
personal use.

26. On August 15, 2016, Defendant VOS Capital was incorporated in South Carolina.
Carducci held himself out as the President and sole owner of VOS Capital, and VOS Capitalâs
address was the same as Carducciâs residence.

27. On or about August 25, 2016, Carducci opened a business checking account for
VOS Capital at Wells Fargo Bank (the âWells Fargo Accountâ). On the application to open the
account, Carducci listed himself as the âsole ownerâ of VOS Capital and the âowner with control
of the entity.â

28. Defendants solicited prospective Pool Participants through in-person meetings,
telephone calls, e-mails, text messages and word of mouth, seeking out individuals who would
agree to let Carducci trade forex on their behalf through his company, VOS Capital.

29. In soliciting prospective Pool Participants, Carducci, as an officer and agent of
VOS Capital, made the following misrepresentations, among others:

a. that Carducci was a highly successful forex trader;
o

that by virtue of his trading success Carducci was able to make frequent
international trips and to acquire luxury automobiles and expensive clothing;
c. at least one Pool Participant was told that Carducci has made $11 million from
forex trading;
d. Pool Participants were told that they would receive profits of 8% to 18% per
month, and some were told that they were guaranteed not to lose money;
e. that VOS Capital had a forex trading account at a registered retail foreign
exchange dealer located in New York, NY (Forex Dealer 1) and that Pool
Participantsâ funds would be traded in that account; and
f. Defendants told at least one Pool Participant that VOS Capital had $12 million
in client funds under management in the account at Forex Dealer 1.

30. At the direction of the Defendants, several Pool Participants entered into a written
âClient Agreementâ with VOS Capital. Carducci provided the Client Agreement to Pool
Participants by e-mail or through other means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce. The
agreement contained multiple false statements, including:

a. VOS Capital âshall provide investment management to Clientâ;
b. that invested funds would be held in a âmanaged investment portfolioâ;
c. that VOS Capital would receive no compensation until âthe full initial
investment is doubledâ;
d. â[iJn the case of a loss [of] principle [sic] investment is to remain safeâ; and
e. â[w]ithdrawals will be completed within seven to ten business days.â
31. To conceal from Pool Participants that their funds had been misappropriated,

Carducci told some Pool Participants, both orally and in written purported account statements,
after they invested, that their investments were making money, and at least one Pool Participant
was told that his investment had doubled in value. In a telephone conversation Carducci falsely
stated to one Pool Participant, several months after he invested, that his investment had made a
profit of $100,000. These statements were false.

32. Further to conceal from Pool Participants that their funds had been
misappropriated, Defendants also sent false account statements to some of the Pool Participants
after they invested, claiming that their investments were making money from forex trading, when
in fact Defendants never traded forex on behalf of Pool Participants.

33. For example, one Pool Participant, who invested $192,000 with Defendants,
received from Carducci, periodically from in or about December 2017 until in or about August
2018, a document entitled âInvestment Account Summaryâ falsely indicating that the amount of
this Participantâs investment was purportedly steadily increasing in value. One such Summary
indicated that this Participantâs funds had been placed in the âmedium risk pool . . . mainly
comprised of the Eur/Usd [Euro/U.S. Dollar] pairâ of currencies. The Summary further stated
that the value of this Participantâs investment had purportedly increased from $192,000 to more
than $340,000.

34. Another Pool Participant, who had invested $20,000 with Defendants in or about
April 2018, received via e-mail from Carducci in or about June and July 2018, two âInvestment
Account Summaryâ documents, falsely indicating that this Participantâs funds were invested in
both a low risk and a high risk pool, listing various forex products in which these pools were
supposedly invested, and indicating that the value of this Participantâs investment had

purportedly increased to over $25,000.
Case 1:19-cv-08351 Document3 Filed 09/09/19 Page 10 of 22

35. Defendants failed to trade forex on behalf of Pool Participants, as they
represented they would do. Although Defendants represented to Pool Participants that
Defendants had a trading account at Forex Dealer | and that Participantsâ funds would be traded
in off-exchange forex in a trading account at Forex Dealer 1, Defendants never had an active
trading account at Forex Dealer | during the Relevant Period.

36. For a short time during the Relevant Period, from on or about August 17, 2016 to
on or about February 7, 2017, VOS Capital maintained a trading account at a registered futures
commission merchant (FCM 1). The account was opened with a deposit of $5,000, incurred
losses as a result of trades in crude oil futures contracts, and was closed with a balance of
approximately $3,432, which balance was transferred to VOS Capitalâs Well Fargo Account. No
forex trading occurred in this account at FCM 1.

37. Upon information and belief, Carducci did not have any trading accounts in his
name during the Relevant Period.

38. Defendants made the misrepresentations and omissions alleged herein willfully or
with reckless disregard for the truth and by use of the mails or other means or instrumentalities
of interstate commerce.

B. Defendants Misappropriated Pool Participantsâ Funds

39. Defendants instructed Pool Participants either to wire their funds to the Wells
Fargo Account (a business checking account in the name of VOS Capital) or, if they wished to
invest by check or cash, to send the funds to VOS Capitalâs business address (which was also
Carducciâs residence address in Clemson, S.C.).

AO. Most, if not all, funds invested with Defendants by Pool Participants during the

Relevant Period were deposited into the Wells Fargo Account (either by wire transfers sent

10
directly from Pool Participants, or by Defendants depositing checks or cash received from Pool

Participants).

41. Carducci was the sole signatory on the Wells Fargo Account during the Relevant
Period.

42. Account statements for the Wells Fargo Account show that during the Relevant

Period, rather than using Pool Participantsâ funds for trading forex as Defendants had represented
they would, Defendants instead used that account for Carducciâs personal benefit. Specifically,
Defendants made payments from the Wells Fargo Account totaling at least approximately
$700,000 to and for, among other things, Carducciâs student loan; dozens of restaurants; bars and
nightclubs; numerous luxury hotels, including in Italy, London, Monaco, and The Netherlands;
gas stations; supermarkets; numerous high-end stores including Neiman Marcus, Tiffanyâs,
Louis Vuitton, and Burberryâs; sporting goods stores, fitness clubs, and golf courses; pet stores;
numerous airlines; Amtrak; Uber; movies, videos, and to the Apple iTunes Store; luxury car
dealers including Porsche and for exotic car rentals; and residential lease payments. In addition,
during the Relevant Period Defendants made frequent ATM and other cash withdrawals from the
Wells Fargo Account, and made numerous transfers to Carducci, or for his benefit, totaling at
least approximately $250,000.

43. A specific example of Defendantsâ misappropriation occurred with Pool
Participant 1. When Carducci learned that Pool Participant 1 was responsible for investing his
fatherâs retirement funds, Carducci called Pool Participant 1 on a daily basis until Pool
Participant | agreed to invest with Defendants. In these calls, Carducci made various
misrepresentations to Pool Participant | including, among other things, telling Pool Participant 1

that Carducci was managing $12 million in client funds and earning large profits trading forex

11
for clients; that if Pool Participant 1 invested he would earn profits from forex trading of between
8% to 16% per month; and that Pool Participant 1 was guaranteed not to lose money. Carducci
also provided Pool Participant 1 with the VOS Capital Client Agreement, which contained
multiple false statements, including that withdrawals would be completed within seven to ten
business days. On or about December 11, 2017, Pool Participant 1 invested with the Defendants
by wiring $192,000 from his fatherâs retirement funds to the VOS Capital Wells Fargo Account,
in accordance with wire transfer instructions that Pool Participant 1 received from Carducci.
Thereafter, Carducci sent Pool Participant | multiple false purported Account Summaries,
claiming that Pool Participant 1 had earned large profits and, according to one of the Account
Summaries, his investment had increased to a value of over $340,000. On or about June 1, 2018,
Pool Participant 1 requested of Carducci a withdrawal of $276,000, the then purported value of
Pool Participant 1âs investment. Defendants did not comply with that withdrawal request. On or
about August 4, 2018, when Pool Participant 1 received an account statement from Carducci
claiming that Pool Participant 1âs investment had increased in value to over $340,000, Pool
Participant 1 requested to Carducci that Pool Participant 1âs investment be closed and that all his
funds and purported profits be returned. In a series of conversations over several months with
Pool Participant 1, Carducci offered multiple excuses as to why funds could not be returned to
Pool Participant 1, including claiming that Pool Participant 1âs funds had been sent to an off-
shore account. After Pool Participant 1 made repeated requests to Carducci over several months
that his funds be returned, Defendants eventually returned only approximately $22,000 to Pool
Participant 1.

44. To date, despite repeated requests to Carducci for the return of their funds, most

Pool Participants have not received their funds back from the Defendants.

12
Case 1:19-cv-08351 Document3 Filed 09/09/19 Page 13 of 22

45. To the extent some Pool Participants have received funds back from Defendants,
those funds were misappropriated by Defendants from other Pool Participants, in the nature of a
Ponzi scheme.

46. The Wells Fargo Account was closed in or about September 2018.

47. Defendants misappropriated Pool Participantsâ funds by use of the mails or other
means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce.

C. VOS Capital Acted as an Unregistered CPO, and Carducci Acted as an
Unregistered AP of a CPO

A8. During the Relevant Period, Defendant VOS Capital, through Defendant
Carducci, acted by operating or soliciting funds for a pooled investment vehicle that is not an
ECP and that engages in retail forex transactions.

49. During the Relevant Period, Carducci acted in a capacity requiring registration as
an AP of a CPO by soliciting customers and prospective customers for participation in a pooled
investment vehicle, while associated with VOS Capital as a partner, officer, employee, or similar
agent.

50. During the Relevant Period, VOS Capital was not registered with the Commission
as a CPO, and Carducci was not registered with the Commission as an AP of a CPO as required
by the Act and Regulations.

D. Carducci Was a Controlling Person of VOS Capital

51. Defendant Carducci was a controlling person of VOS Capital. Carducci was the
founder, President and sole owner of VOS Capital. Carducci told Participants that he was
responsible for the trading at VOS Capital and was generally the sole source of information for

Pool Participants regarding VOS Capital and their investments. Carducci controlled the VOS

13
Case 1:19-cv-08351 Document3 Filed 09/09/19 Page 14 of 22

Capital Wells Fargo Account, into which Pool Participants transferred funds for the purpose of
trading forex.
E. Carducci Acted _as an Agent for VOS Capital

52. Through his solicitation of prospective and existing Pool Participants and his
continued communication with Pool Participants regarding their purported trading success on
behalf of VOS Capital, Carducci acted as an agent of VOS Capital.

COMMISSION REGULATIONS

14
55. Section 2(c)(2)(C)(iv) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(c)(2)(C)Gv) (2012), provides that
7 U.S.C. Â§ 6b(a)(2)(A)-(C) of the Act also applies to the forex transactions, agreements, or
contracts offered by Defendants âas ifâ they were a contract of sale of a commodity for future
delivery.

56. 17 C.F.R. Â§ 5.2(b) makes it unlawful âfor any person, by use of the mails or by

58. Defendants committed the acts and practices described above using
instrumentalities of interstate commerce, including the use of interstate wires for transfer of

59. Defendants committed the acts and practices described herein willfully, or with
reckless disregard for the truth.

60. The foregoing acts, omissions and failures as alleged in this Count of Carducci,
