15. Atwood Ltd. was a registered New York corporation. Atwood Ltd. operated out
of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil but claimed that its main office is in Rochester, New York. Atwood
Ltd., along with Atwood Â§.A., engaged in the business of soliciting and accepting funds from

' clients to trade foreign currency options on their behalf. Atwood Ltd. has never been registered
with the Commission in any capacity.

16. Atwood S.A. was a registered New York corporation. Atwood S.A. operated out
of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil but claimed its main office in Rochester, New York. Atwood S.A.,
along with Atwood Ltd., engaged im the business of soliciting clients and accepting funds from
clients to trade foreign currency options with or on their behalf. Atwood S.A. has never been
registered with the Commission in any capacity.

17. _Kardonick is an individual who is currently incarcerated in Federal custody.
Kardonick, through Atwood, engaged in the business of soliciting clients and accepting funds to
trade foreign currency options with or on their behalf. Kardonick, at different time, identified
himself as the president or a principal of Atwood. Other Atwood representatives and the Atwood
website described Kardomick as Atwoodâs head analyst and trader. Kardonick was a signatory
on bank accounts in the name of Atwood Ltd. and Atwood 8.A. He has never been registered
with the Commission in any capacity.

18.  Shapoff is an individual who is currently incarcerated in Federal custody.
Shapoff was often identified as an agent, employee or officer of Atwood and solicited clients on
behalf of Atwood to trade foreign currency options. Shapoff was a signatory on an Atwood Â§.A.
bank account. He has never been registered with the Commission in any capacity.

2. Defendantsâ Solicitation of Clients

19. Beginning in or about January 2005 and continuing to January 22, 2009,

(âRelevant Periodâ) Defendants fraudulently solicited and accepted funds from multiple
DEC B1 2ldacd 6:65: cVOESSLCIS!MWP Documeft 73! Fifet?12/0b/F4 Pages ti24 =P aeves

individuals located throughout the world, including the United States, the United Kingdom and
other parts of Western Europe, for the purported purpose of trading foreign currency options.
Defendants fraudulently solicited more than $1 million, and misappropriated client funds for
personal use.

20. Atwood, Kardonick and Shapoff solicited clients through the internet at
www.atwoodjames.com, mail flyers, other promotional material, cold calling and other personal
solicitations. Atwood 8.A.âs solicitations focused on prospective clients located in Portugal and
Atwood Ltd.âs solicitations focused on prospective clients located in the United States, the
United Kingdom and elsewhere. However, Atwood 8.A. and Atwood Ltd. representatives
generally referred only to âAtwoodâ in their oral solicitations of prospective clients.

21, In its written and oral solicitations, Atwood, directly and through its employees,
agents and officers, and , Kardonick and Shapoff directly made material misrepresentations and
omissions concerning, among other things, Atwoodâs operations and regulatory status,
Defendantsâ lengthy and successful trading histories, the safety of clientsâ principal investment
due to the use of certain trading strategies, and Kardonick and Shapoffâs criminal records.
Overall, Atwood conveyed to prospective clients that profitable returms on small investments in
foreign currency options were highly likely, if not virtually guaranteed.

22. Through its website, www.atwoodjames.com, promotional material and customer
agreements, Atwood offerred trading in foreign currency options in the âglobal foreign exchange
marketâ (âforex marketâ). The website provided a detailed description of the forex market,
advice on investing in foreign currency options, as well as regularly updated market reports.
Through its oral solicitations of at least certain prospective clients, Atwood, Kardonick and

Shapoff emphasized that Atwood trades foreign currency options on U.S. exchanges on behalf of
DEC G1 2Atasd 66S chOEOSZEUSIMWP = Documeht 73! SFiReP 12/08/84 5 Peg? G24 P.88725

its clients.

23. On the website and in the flyers and other materials, Atwood created an
appearance of a sophisticated global enterprise. Its website contact information indicated its
office is in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. In email correspondence, Atwood also listed offices in
Amsterdam, London and New York City. To create the appearance of a strong European
presence, Atwood used what appears to be a British royal family crest with the letters âAâ and
âJâ emblazoned on it as its logo, and âLtdâ in its name, a British commonwealth term for
incorporation. The Atwood website also claimed to serve âclients al] over Western and Central
Europe.â Similarly, with respect to their solicitations of prospective clients in areas such as
Portugal, Atwood used âS.A.â in its name and logo.

24. â- Yet, in certain oral solicitations, Atwood, Kardonick and Shapoff emphasized that
while having a global presence, its main office was in Rochester, New York. Earlier United
States clients understood Atwoodâs main office to be in New York City.

25, Atwoodâs website reassured prospective clients that, with Atwood, the customer
receives over 30 years of combined tenure in the forex market with the ability to âinstantly
choose and execute trades most likely to succeed for our clients.â Atwoodâs website provided
further reassurance about Atwoodâs experience by stating that âit has unparalleled knowledge of
the forex market supported by experience in commodity futures and options.â Atwood further
claimed on the website that it focused on forex exclusively the last fifteen years. By such clairns,
Atwood implied that it has been profitably engaged in foreign currency trading for much of the
time after its initial incorporation in 1978.

26. Atwood also used promotional flyers that similarly emphasized its claimed almost

30-year trading history. At least one Atwood client saw an Atwood flyer stating, âSmall
DEC G1 2hddcd BGR cVOGSELEISIMWP = Documett 73! Fire i 2/0B/F4 âPages ti24 =P Baves

movements. Big benefits ... Every day for the past 29 years, we have been making timely and
intelligent decisions on behalf of our clients. Isnât it time you found out how you can earn big
investments from small currency movements?â

27. According to its website and oral solicitations, Atwood, Kardonick and Shapoff
purportedly assigned a team of three, a broker, analyst, and strategist, to each client account, and
promised weekly contact to discuss planned transactions. Clients either provided powers of
attorney to allow Atwood to trade on their behalf without explicit approval, i.e., with discretion,
or authorized all transactions to be executed on their behalf.

28. Atwood purported to offer four month trades where at the end of four months
Atwood exercised the options, and the client could elect to withdraw principal and revenue or
reinvest and plan another four month trade.

29. In the website, Atwood pronounced that âOur goal for you is a 30% return in four
months. That is equivalent to a 90% annual retum, When is the last time your stocks almost
doubled in a year!â

30. Inthe website, Atwood provided an example of âA Typical Forex Trading
Experienceâ to show how they may achieve this goal by using a trading strategy called a
âstraddle.â Atwoodâs website described a straddle as âplaying on both sides of the fenceâ and as
an âinsurance policyâ against heavy losses.

31.  Atwoodâs website also represented that Atwood trades through a clearing firm
and deals with established firms. To convince prospective clients that Atwood was a âlegitimate
company,â Atwoodâs website answered the question of âhow do I know that I am dealing with a
legitimate companyâ by stating that âit is important to trade with firms which are utilizing

established financial entitiesâ and claiming its âcurrent clearing firm did $28 billion dollars in
DEC G1 20Â¢4sd 6:62 cVDEOSLEIS!MWP Docume 73! âFife 12/08/F4 âPages GF24 0 PL ves

business last year.â

32. The Atwood website also reassured prospective clients that they would be able to
track an optionâs current market value because âcurrencies are traded on exchanges that have
continuous electronic quotation systems.â

33. To further lull prospective clients into believing that Atwood was legitimate and
regulated, the website then claimed that the Atwood advisors and principals âalthough they are
not have required to be licensed to trade foreign currency options, have been licensed through |
various governmental agencies at one time or another in the past most still are.â

34. Atwoodâs, Kardonickâs and Shapoftâs personal solicitations repeated the claims of
Atwoodâs vast and successful trading experience, the legitimacy of Atwood and its
representatives through licensing, regulation and exchange trading, the likelihood of profits, and
the security of clientsâ principal through the use of the straddle strategy.

35. Shortly after mailing an Atwood postage-paid flyer, or sometimes without prior
contact, prospective clients received a call from an Atwood representative. The Atwood
representative urged prospective clients to purchase options in Eurodollars or the Japanese Yen
in order to capitalize on markets that Atwood represented would move dramatically.

36. During these imitial calls with at least certain prospective clients, Atwood
representatives emphasized that Atwood was a licensed or registered U.S. entity regulated by the
U.S. government to trade foreign currency options, and in certain instances, claimed the trading
occurred on U.S. exchanges.

37. Atwood also reinforced the use and protections of the straddle strategy. Atwood
representatives told prospective clients that, with this strategy, clients would not lose their

principal. Those same representatives created the impression that Atwoodâs trading strategy
DEC G1 2@sel6:098cw-B6bS2Â°RIS'MWP DocumÃ©se73 ! Filed12/68/14 =Pagestrap24 oF. 1ives

virtually guaranteed profits. For example, one prospective client was told that he would never
lose his investment and if he did, he would be the âunluckiest trader in history.â

38. In one such solicitation, Atwood, Kardonick and Shapoff told clients and
prospective chents that Atwood conducted its business and trading out of its main office in
Rochester, New York. The Atwood website and emails, however, did not provide any
information conceming a Rochester office. To the contrary, the website listed only an address
and telephone number in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Atwood emails identified other Atwood offices
purportedly located in Amsterdam, London and NewYork City, but not Rochester. When
questioned by prospective clients, Atwood representatives provided a Rochester address, a local
Rochester telephone number and a toll-free telephone number. These contact points were for
Shapoff.

39. At least three of Atwoodâs clients called the Rochester local and toll-free
telephone numbers to verify that Atwood was a U.S. company with a legitimate and substantial
presence in the United States.

40. In one instance, a prospective client called the Rochester number and a person
named âGaryâ answered the telephone. âGaryâ told this client that all Atwood representatives
were out of the office and that no other executives were available to talk at that time. Gary also
told the client that the Rochester office had 16 other people in it, but that none had direct lines
because they were traders and did not wish to be interrupted while trading. âGaryâ was Shapoff.

41. Prospective clients were satisfied after calling the Rochester numbers that they
were dealing with a legitimate U.S. entity based in Rochester, New York.

42. During the telephone solicitations, if prospective clients questioned Atwoodâs,

Kardonickâs and Shapoffâs claim that clientsâ principal was not at risk through options trading,

10
DEC G1 2iPlebel 6-082 cVOGOS2Â°ESS'MWP DocumÃ©HÃ©73! Fil@eet2/08/f4 =PagesrhaP24 fF. 12-25

or if they were unable to invest the minimum investment amount of $13,000, the Atwood
representative referred them to the website and a âsenior trading advisor,â or to Kardonick
himself, who representatives and Kardonick describe as Atwoodâs head trading advisor.

43. Atwood representatives informed prospective clients that Kardonick had over 30
years of trading experience with a virtually spotless trading history. Representatives also told
prospective clients that Kardonick made the decisions on whether a prospective client may invest
less that the required minimum amount.

44. â_ Kardonick boasted to prospective clients that he was one of the best in the
business with over 30 years of experience in options trading âon Wall Streetâ and regaled them
with supposed connections with heads of state, Wall Street and politicians. He reiterated that
when trading with Atwood, clientsâ principal investments were safe and profitable returns were
virtually guaranteed.

45. _ As part of their solicitations, Atwood, Kardonick and Shapoff provided a
Customer Advisory Agreement for clients to sign (the âAgreementâ). The Agreement referenced
on-exchange and over-the-counter trading of foreign currency options but did not specify where
or with whom trading occurs. The only trading entity referenced is Atwood.

46. The Agreement also provided that Atwood charged a $220 commission fee and a
$20 administrative fee per option contract.

47. â Atwood instructed the prospective clients to strike certain risk disclosure
provisions in the Agreement, including provisions stating that âas a result of market conditions
and other factors, you may sustain a loss to your initial investment and any additional fund[s]
you deposit,â and â[s]trategies utilizing ...straddles may have as much risk as simple long or

short positions. It may be difficult or impossible to execute orders and offset or liquidate open

1]
DEC 41 2@ebe!6:08Fcv-BEBSPÂ°EIS'MWP DocumÃ©ft73 ! FilÃ©d412/08/14! SPage3eh24 =P. 13725

market position due to market liquidity and /or operations.â

48. At the same time, Atwood instructed prospective clients to highlight a statement
in the Agreement that emphasizes the much higher probability of a profitable returm based on the
straddle strategy touted in Atwoodâs personal solicitations of prospective clients. The

highlighted statement provides:
However options traded on a weighted straddle basis have a much higher
probability of making money Then [sic] just playing calls or puts alone, also
buying options closer to market price greatly enhances your chances of
making money.

49. The highlighted statement reinforced Atwoodâs, Kardonickâs and Shapoffâs oral
reassurances to prospective chents concerning the security of their investment through use of the
straddle strategy and eviscerated the risk disclosure set forth immediately above it in the
Agreement, which included the statement that âan option is an extremely complicated trading
vehicle, which carries substantial risks ...â

50. Atwood instructed clients to wire funds to U.S. bank accounts held in the name of
Atwood. Kardonick was a signatory on the Atwood bank accounts, and Shapoff was a signatory
on at least one Atwood bank account.

51. Thereafter, Atwood sent confirmations on Atwood letterhead of the profitable
trades purportedly executed by Atwood traders. The confirmations contained the clientâs name,
the clientâs account number, analyst name, and the date and details of the trades. The
confirmations did not reflect any exchange, clearing firm, or counterparty information. The only
company identified on the confirmations is Atwood. Based on the confirmations, Atwood clients
believed their funds were held in segregated accounts in their individual names.

52. Along with the confirmations showing profitable trading, Atwood, Kardonick and

Shapoff also made oral representations that clients were making money through Atwoodâs

12
DEC B81 2@eselG:09&cv-O6O82Â°RISIMWP DocumÃ©At73 ! Filed2/08/14' 5Pageaassh24 =P. L4ves

trading.

53. After receiving written and oral representations of profitable trading based on
their initial investments, some Atwood clients invested additional funds with Atwood.

54. To the extent that Atwood and Kardonick actually engaged in any trading on
behalf of clients, in at least one instance, Atwood and Kardonick traded client funds without
client authorization. The client had not granted Atwood power of attomey over the trading of his
account. He initially authorized certain trades in Euro options. Shortly thereafter, Atwood
informed the client that his Euro options trade had reached its strike price and, if the client
relinquished his position, he would sell for a profit of $1,000 or 15%. The client instructed
Atwood to exercise the option and pay him his principal and return. Instead, Atwood sold the
Euro option and bought five Japanese Yen puts for a total of $6,650. When the client
complained, an Atwood representative said Kardonick had authorized the trade.

55. With respect to at least certain Atwood clients, Atwood eventually notified them
that all their funds had been lost in trading, including their principal investments. Despite
demands by clients, Atwood refused to refund clientsâ principal. Atwood also refused to provide
additional documentation that Atwood was indeed trading on behalf of the clients.

3. Defendantsâ Solicitations Were False and Misleading
56. Defendantsâ solicitations of prospective and existing clients as alleged above were

materially false and misleading because, among other things:

(a) Atwood Ltd., Atwood 8.A., and Kardonick did not hold any known licenses or
registrations with the United States government in connection with the trading of foreign
currency options; specifically, Atwood and Kardonick were not registered with the
Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission or any other financial regulator;

(b) Atwood had not been profitably trading foreign currency options for the last fifteen
years on behalf of clients; as noted herein, no Atwood trading accounts were located and
funds in Atwood bank accounts were not used for trading on behalf of clients; in addition,

13
DEC G1 2@aseld:09%cV-B6BS29RISIMWP DocumÃ©stÃ©73 ! FilÃ©a2/68/14 =Page3eep24 =P. LS v25

although Atwood Ltd. has an incorporation date of 1978, the New York Division of
Corporations dissolved it in 1982, and Atwood did not form again until 2005. Similarly,

Atwood 8.A, did not form until 2003;

(c) Defendants failed to disclose that Kardonick and Shapoff had criminal fraud
convictions;

(d) Atwood did not maintain an office with staff in Rochester, New York. The Rochester
address Atwood provided was the address of a retail clothing store and the Rochester
telephone number Atwood provided was the home telephone number of . Shapoff; and

(e) even with the use of the straddle strategy, clientsâ principal was at risk when trading
foreign currency options.

57.  Atwoodâs, Kardonickâs and Shapoffâs solicitations were also false and misleading
because, despite claims that Atwood successfully traded on U.S, exchanges and that Atwood
traded through a clearing firm, Atwood never traded on behalf of or in the name of clients on
U.S. exchanges or indeed, anywhere. Likewise, Atwood did not have a relationship with a
clearing firm. Moreover, no at any FCM or other financial institution holds trading accounts in
the name of or controlled by Atwood Ltd. or Atwood S.A.

58, Defendantsâs solicitations were also false and misleading because Kardonick was not
a successful foreign currency options trader. Kardonickâs commodity futures and options trading
accounts reflect that from 2003 through September 2008, Kardonick sustained net trading losses
of approximately $1.7 million.

| 59. Defendants knowingly or with reckless disregard made the above-alleged material
misrepresentations or omissions. Atwood clients relied on these misrepresentations and
omissions in making their decisions to trade foreign currency options with Atwood.

4, Defendants Misappropriated Funds
60. Defendants accepted funds from Atwood clients for the purported purpose of

14
DEC Bl 2Qacel 6CCHDEOILEISMGNIP Docum@Be73! FiSEC12/O0/P4 SPARE ER24 = F-18725

trading foreign currency options.

61. Defendants misappropriated client funds for personal use and to make payments to
other Atwood clients.
B. Conclusions of Law

1. Jurisdiction and Venue

62. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2012),
which provides that whenever it shall appear to the Commission that any person has engaged, is
engaging, or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a violation of any provision of
the Act or any rule, regulation, or order promulgated thereunder, the Commission may bring an
action in the proper district court of the United States against such person to enjoin such act or
practice, or to enforce compliance with the Act, or any rule, regulation or order thereunder.

63. Venue properly lies with this Court pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
Â§ 13a-1(e) (2012), because the Defendants reside in this jurisdiction and the acts and practices in
violation of the Act occurred within this District.

2. Fraud by Misrepresentations and Omissions, False Account Statements, and
Misappropriation of Funds

64. By the conduct described in paragraphs 1 through 63 above, Defendants cheated
and defrauded, or attempted to cheat and defraud, and willfully deceived, or attempted to
deceive, their customers by, among other things, knowingly or recklessly making false,
deceptive, or misleading representations and omissions of material facts in their solicitations of
prospective and existing clients to trade foreign currency options, by engaging in unauthorized
trading, by issuing false oral and written statements concerning the profitability of trading on
behalf of clients, and by misappropriating client funds in violation of 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6c(b) (2012),

and 17 C.F.R. 1,1(6)(1)-(3), and 32.9(2013).

15
DEC Bl 2@abel6:09Â¢cVOeOS2Â°RIS'MWP DocumÃ©AÃ©73! Filed12/68/4 âPagetesh24 =P - eves

65, Kardonick and Shapoff controlled Atwood, directly or indirectly, and did not act in
good faith or knowingly induced, directly or indirectly, Atwoodâs act or acts in violation of the Act and
Regulations; therefore, pursuant to 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13c(b) (2012), Kardonick and Shapoff are liable for
Atwoodâs violations of 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6Â¢(b) (2012), and 17 C.F.R. 1.1(6)(1)-(3), and 32.9(2013),
