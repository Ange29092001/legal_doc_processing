ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTION 6(c) AND (d) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, MAKING
FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

I.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionââ) has reason to believe
Tillage Commodities, LLC (âRespondentâ) violated Commission Regulation (âRegulationâ)
166.3, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 166.3 (2017). Therefore, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the
public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted to determine
whether Respondent engaged in the violation set forth herein and to determine whether any order
should be issued imposing remedial sanctions.

Il.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Respondent has
submitted an Offer of Settlement (âOfferâ), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Without admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, Respondent consents to
the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Section 6(c) and (d) of the Commodity
Exchange Act Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (âOrderâ) and acknowledges
service of this Order.'

 

' Respondent consents to the entry of this Order and to the use of these findings in this
proceeding and in any other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission
is a party; provided, however, that Respondent does not consent to the use of the Offer, or the
findings or conclusions in this Order consented to in the Offer, as the sole basis for any other
proceeding brought by the Commission, other than in a proceeding in bankruptcy or to enforce
the terms of this Order. Nor does Respondent consent to the use of the Offer or this Order, or the
findings or conclusions in this Order consented to in the Offer, by any other party in any other
proceeding.
II.
The Commission finds the following:

A. SUMMARY

From at least March 3, 2016 through March 24, 2016 (âRelevant Periodâ), Respondent, a
registered commodity pool operator (âCPOâ), failed to supervise diligently its fund
administratorâs operation of the commodity poolâs bank account containing participantsâ funds
(âpool bank accountâ).â Respondent also failed to ensure that certain aspects of its compliance
and supervision programs comported with its obligations to supervise diligently the handling by
its partners, officers, employees, and agents of all activities relating to its business as a
Commission registrant. These failuresâwhich delayed detection of an ongoing fraud, resulting

in a $5.9 million loss of pool participantsâ funds, or 64% of the poolâs total capitalâwere in
violation of Commission Regulation 166.3, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 166.3 (2017).

B. RESPONDENT

Tillage Commodities, LLC has been registered as a CPO with the Commission since
2013. Its principal office is located in Stamford, Connecticut.

C. FACTS

Respondent used a third-party fund administrator to provide administrative services,
which included operating the pool bank account; processing and disbursing customer
redemptions and/or withdrawals; and maintaining books and records. Pursuant to the agreement
with the fund administrator, Tillage Commodities Management, LLC? was required to
âdesignate a member of [its] Management to oversee the record-keeping and administrative
services provided by [the fund administrator]â and âreview and approve all reports, analyses and
books and records resulting from the aforementioned services.â During the Relevant Period,
Respondent kept a majority of pool participantsâ funds in the pool bank account as opposed to
the poolâs trading account.

During the Relevant Period, over the course of twenty-one days, the fund administrator
received seven fraudulent requests to transfer funds from the pool bank account, five of which
were successfully processed. These unauthorized transfers to two purported private technology
companies in Hong Kong ranged in amount from $200,000 to $3 million. These requests were
made by an unknown party who spoofed Respondentâs managing memberâs email address and
sent requests that imitated, in some respects, Respondentâs typical transfer requests.

 

Â° Respondent operates the commodity pool Tillage Commodities Fund, LP. The referenced bank
account was held in the name of the commodity pool.

, Tillage Commodities Management, LLC, the investment manager of Respondentâs commodity
pool, is the signatory to the agreement with Respondentâs fund administrator.
Although only the fund administrator had the right to make withdrawals from the pool
bank account, Respondent did not have any procedures in place to monitor the fund
administratorâs operation of this account. Instead, during the period when the fraud occurred,
Tillage only reviewed the pool bank accountâs balance once during the month to verify its
calculation of the poolâs net asset value. Respondent also did not have any system in place to
alert it when transactions cleared from the account. Furthermore, while Respondent could
review the activity in the account on the bankâs website, from January 7, 2016 to March 24,
2016, Respondent failed to do so. The inadequacy of Respondentâs supervision of its agent
regarding wire transfers and the operation of the pool bank account, and its policies and systems,
are evidenced by the fact that Respondent only became aware of the multiple fraudulent transfers
on March 24, 2016 when the fund administrator notified Respondent of the seventh suspicious
wire transfer request. These failures delayed detection of the ongoing fraud, which resulted in a
$5.9 million loss of pool participantsâ funds, or 64% of the poolâs total capital."

IV.
LEGAL DISCUSSION

Regulation 166.3, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 166.3 (2017), requires that every Commission registrantâ
âdiligently supervise the handling by its partners, officers, employees and agentsâ of all activities
relating to its business as a registrant. See In re FCStone, LLC, CFTC No. 15-21, 2015 WL
2066891, at *2 (May 1, 2015) (consent order). Regulation 166.3 imposes upon a registrant an
affirmative duty to supervise its employees and agents diligently by establishing, implementing
and executing an adequate supervisory structure and compliance program. Jn re Vision
Financial Markets, CFTC No. 13-36, 2013 WL 5376144, at *2 (Sept. 24, 2013) (consent order).
For a registrant to fulfill its duties under Regulation 166.3, it must both design an adequate
program of supervision and ensure that the program is followed. In re GNP Commodities, Inc.,
CFTC No. 89-1, 1992 WL 201158, at *17-19 (Aug. 11, 1992), aff'd sub nom. Moneison v.
CFTC, 996 F.2d 852 (7th Cir. 1993).

A violation of Regulation 166.3 is an independent violation for which no underlying
violation is necessary. FCStone, 2015 WL 2066891, at *7; In re FCStone LLC, CFTC No. 13-
24, 2013 WL 2368539, at *17 (May 29, 2013) (consent order); In re Forex Capital Mkts. LLC,
CFTC No. 12-01, 2011 WL 4689390, at *3 (Oct. 3, 2011) (consent order); In re First National
Trading Corp., CFTC No. 92-17, 1994 WL 378010, at *10 (July 20, 1994) (citing In re Paragon
Futures Assân, CFTC No. 88-18, 1992 WL 74261 (Apr. 1, 1992)). Consequently, a violation of
Regulation 166.3 is demonstrated by showing either that: (1) the registrantâs supervisory system

 

+A majority of the funds held by the pool were attributable to a single participant, who is also
the managing member of the Respondent. Notably, following discovery of the fraud,
Respondent communicated with the pool participants immediately and offered them the option to
redeem, in full or in part, their balance in the pool prior to the fraud. Most participants have
received a full redemption; however, a few participants have opted not to redeem.

> An exception to this obligation exists for associated persons who do not have not supervisory
duties.
was generally inadequate, or (2) the registrant failed to perform its supervisory duties diligently.
FCStone, 2015 WL 2066891, at *3 (citing In re Murlas Commodities, CFTC No. 85-29, 1995
WL 523563 (Sept. 1, 1995)); Paragon, 1992 WL 74261, at *14 (concluding that the âfocus of
any proceeding to determine whether Rule 166.3 has been violated will be on whether [a] review
[has] occurred and, if it did, whether it was âdiligentââ); GNP Commodities, 1992 WL 201158, at
*19 (providing that, even if an adequate supervisory system is in place, Regulation 166.3 can still
be violated if the supervisory system is not diligently administered).

While the absence of a written policy or formal training on every issue does not
constitute a failure to supervise, Regulation 166.3 explicitly requires all registered CPOs to
diligently supervise all activities of its officers, employees, and agents relating to its business as
a CPO. Under Regulation 166.3, a registrant has a âduty to develop procedures for the âdetection
and deterrence of [CEA violations] by its agents.ââ Samson Refining Co. v. Drexel Burnham
Lambert, Inc., CFTC No. 82-R448, 1990 WL 282783, at *11 (Feb. 16, 1990). A registrantâs
failure to develop proper procedures for the detection of wrongdoing can evidence the lack of an
adequate supervisory system. See CFTC y. Sidoti, 178 F.3d 1132 (11th Cir. 1999); In re Open E
Cry, CFTC No. 12-24, 2012 WL 10259805, at *6 (June 7, 2012) (consent order). Whether a
registrant has met its supervisory duties is a fact-intensive determination. See, e.g.,GNP
Commodities, 1992 WL 201158, at *17.

A CPO may delegate the performance of certain services to a fund administrator,
including those services delegated by the Respondent in this case. In contracting with an agent
to perform these services, however, a CPO cannot abdicate its responsibilities under Regulation
166.3 and must diligently supervise the agentâs handling of all activities relating to the CPOâs
business as a Commission registrant. The protection of pool participantsâ funds must be of
paramount concern for a CPO. Consequently, the management and oversight by a CPO of its
poolâs bank account, which is comprised of pool participantsâ funds, squarely falls within the
scope of Regulation 166.3. Here, Respondentâs failure to diligently supervise its fund
administratorâs operation of the pool bank account, resulting in a significant loss of participantsâ
funds, constitutes a violation of Regulation 166.3. Further, Respondent also failed to develop
and implement policies and procedures reasonably designed to detect unauthorized or fraudulent
withdrawals of pool participantsâ funds from the pool bank account. These failures are
evidenced by the fact that for twenty-one days, Respondent was unaware of the five large
withdrawals of funds from the pool bank account and only became aware of such withdrawals
upon notification from its fund administrator.
