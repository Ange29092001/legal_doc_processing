Plaintiff, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCFTCâ or âCommissionâ), by

and through its attorneys, alleges as follows:
I, SUMMARY

I, From at least October 2010 through December 2013 (the âRelevant Periodâ),
Defendants John H. Won, Sungmi Kang, Tae Hung Kang (a/k/a âKevin Kangâ), Safety Capital
Management, Inc. (âSafetyâ) and GNS Capital, Inc. ââGNSâ) (collectively d/b/a
âFOREXNPOWER?â), directly or through their officers, employees or agents, while acting as
commodity trading advisors (âCTAsâ) and commodity pool operators (âCPOsâ), fraudulently
solicited customers and prospective customers for the purported purpose of trading a pooled
investment in connection with agreements, contracts, or transactions in off-exchange foreign
currency (âforexâ) and/or to open retail forex accounts purportedly managed by either Safety or
GNS. In furtherance of the fraudulent scheme, Defendants made material misrepresentations and

omissions in solicitations to actual and prospective customers, including but not limited to falsely

 
Case 1:15-cv-05551 Document 1 Filed 09/24/15 Page 2 of 29 PagelD #: 2

guaranteeing 10% profits per month with no risk of loss. Rather than trading forex on their
customersâ behalf, Defendants misappropriated customersâ funds for Defendantsâ personal use
and benefit, and operated as a âPonziâ scheme by paying customers from the funds of other
customers.

2. During the Relevant Period, Defendants Safety and GNS, by and through their
officers, employees or agents, fraudulently solicited and accepted over $1.5 million from over 90
customers, who were neither eligible contract participants (âECPsâ) nor eligible commercial
entities (ââECEsâ), for both the forex commodity pool and individually managed retail forex
accounts,

3, Total deposits by Safety and GNSâs pool participants into the forex commodity
pool were approximately $718,000. Of this amount, Defendants Sungmi Kang and John Won
misappropriated over $622,000 from at least 37 pool participants, and used the funds for personal
and business expenses rather than for forex trading. Total deposits by Safety and GNSâs
managed retail forex account customers were approximately $845,000 from at least 50
customers. These retail forex customers lost a total of nearly $400,000 in these managed retail
forex accounts, while Safety and GNS were compensated for purportedly managing and trading
the accounts.

4, During the Relevant Period, Defendant Tae Hung Kang personally solicited both
individually managed retail forex account customers and forex pool participants by, among other
misrepresentations, making false guarantees of 10% âprofit per month without risk of loss when,
in reality, Safety and GNSâs customers had lost money in the forex commodity pool and in the

managed retail forex accounts.

 
Case 1:15-cv-05551 Document1 Filed 09/24/15 Page 3 of 29 PagelD #: 3

5, During the Relevant Period, Defendants Safety and GNS also failed to operate the
commodity pool asa separate legal entity â by receiving pool funds in Safety or GNSâs name
rather than the name of the commodity pool, and by commingling pool funds with non-pool
property â and failed to register with the Commission as commodity pool operators (âCPOsâ) .
and commodity trading advisors (âCTASâ),

6, By virtue of this conduct and the conduct further described herein, Defendants,
either directly or as controlling persons, have engaged, are engaging, or are about to engage in
acts and practices in violation of Sections 2(c)(2)(C)(iii)(D)(aa)-(cc), 4b(a)(2)(A) and (C), 4m(1),
and 40(1)(A)-(B) of the Commodity Exchange Act (the âActâ) as amended, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§
2(c)(2)(C)(iii)()(aa)-(ce), 6b(a)(2)(A) and (C), 6m(1), and 60(1)(A)-(B)(2014), and Commission
Regulations (âRegulationsâ) 4.20(a)-(c), 5.2(b), and 5,3(a)(2)-(3), 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 4.20(a)-(c),
5.2(b), and 5.3(a)(2)-(3).

7, Moreover, in October 2014, Defendant GNS failed to respond to a Commission
subpoena requesting documents. By this conduct, GNS violated Commission Regulation 1.31,
17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.31 (2014).

8. During the Relevant Period, Defendants Sungmi Kang, Tae Hung Kang, and John
Won were officers, employees and agents of Safety. Therefore, Safety is liable for the acts and
omissions of Sungmi Kang, Tae Hung Kang, and John Won done in the scope of their
employment or office, pursuant to Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(a)(1)(B), and
Regulation 1.2, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.2.

9, During the Relevant Period, Defendants John Won and Sungmi Kang were

officers, employees and agents of GNS. Therefore, GNS is liable for the acts and omissions of

 
Case 1:15-cv-05551 Document 1 Filed 09/24/15 Page 4 of 29 PagelD #: 4

John Won and Sungmi Kang done in the scope of their employment or office, pursuant to
Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(a)(1)(B), and Regulation 1.2, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.2.

10. Defendant Sungmi Kang was a controlling person of Safety throughout the
Relevant Period and did not act in good faith or knowingly induced Safetyâs violations of the Act
and Regulations described herein. Therefore, Sungmi Kang is liable for Safetyâs violations of
the Act and Regulations, pursuant to Section 13(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13c(b).

11, Defendants John Won and Sungmi Kang were controlling persons of GNS
throughout the Relevant Period and did not act in good faith or knowingly induced GNSâs
violations of the Act and Regulations. Therefore, John Won and Sungmi Kang are liable for
GNSâs violations of the Act and Regulations, pursuant to Section 13(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§
13c(b).

12. Accordingly, pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, as amended, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1
(2012), and Section 2(c)(2)(C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(c)(2)(C) (2012), the Commission brings
this action to enjoin Defendantsâ unlawful acts and practices, to compel their compliance with
the Act and the Regulations promulgated thereunder, and to enjoin them from engaging in any
commodity related activity. In addition, the Commission seeks civil monetary penalties and
remedial ancillary relief, including, but not limited to, trading and registration bans, restitution,
disgorgement, rescission, pre- and post-judgment interest, and such other and further relief as the
Court may deem necessary and appropriate.

13. Unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, Defendants will likely continue to
engage in acts and practices alleged in this Complaint and similar acts and practices, as described

below.

Vv. EACTS
A, Defendantsâ Fraudulent Solicitation and Misappropriation

34. During the Relevant Period, Safety and GNS (collectively d/b/a
FOREXNPOWER), by and through their officers, employees or agents, fraudulently solicited
customers and potential customers to invest in a commodity pool for forex trading and/or to open
retail forex trading accounts purportedly managed by Safety and GNS. The fraudulent
solicitation included, but was not limited to, misrepresentations by the Defendants that
FOREXNPOWER had a âsecret trading methodâ called ASET that guaranteed customers would
obtain a âmonthly profit rate of 10%;â that investors âwill not lose their money at all, not even
$1;â and that customers would make $100,000 with only a $500 investment. These
misrepresentations of guaranteed profits and no risk were false and misleading, as none of
Defendantsâ customers had ever obtained 10% monthly profits, and many of the customers
experienced large losses.

35. Defendants Safety and GNS, by and through their officers, employees or agents,
made the misrepresentations in advertisements placed in Korean language newspapers, on their
website www.forexnpower.com, in written solicitation materials, and at seminars they hosted in

Queens, New York.

 
Case 1:15-cv-05551 Document 1 Filed 09/24/15 Page 10 of 29 PageiD #: 10

36. At the seminars that Defendants Safety and GNS hosted during the Relevant
Period, their principals, employees and agents, including Defendant Tae Hung Kang, made
similar fraudulent statements to customers and prospective customers,

37, For example, on or about March 15, 2012, Defendant Tae Hung Kang solicited
pool participants and retail forex customers at a FOREXNPOWER seminar and represented that
he was the CEO of the company and that the ASET program would in 5 years turn a $3,000
investment into over $900,000 in profits.

38, On another occasion, in or around the summer of 2012, Defendant Tae Hung
Kang, again representing himself as the CEO of FOREXNPOWER, falsely stated to a customer
that the company had yielded 10% profits per month and encouraged the customer to invest
because this was a âlifetime opportunityâ and the customer should ânot miss out.â After this
customer invested, he requested a withdrawal. Tae Hung Kang told the customer that he could
pay the customer back in few weeks because the company was expecting an investment from
another investor, This latter representation is consistent with a Ponzi scheme in which investors
are paid with other investorsâ money.

39, In yet another false solicitation, in an email dated January 11, 2013, Defendants
Safety and GNS, using the d/b/a FOREXNPOWER, by and through their officers, employees or
agents, represented to customers that during the entire month of December 2012, all their
managed forex trading accounts had made a profit of 10% on average. On the contrary, during
this period, the majority of FOREXNPOWERâS managed retail forex customer accounts lost
money,

40, Through the false solicitations described above, Defendants Safety and GNS, by

and through their officers, employees, and agents, fraudulently solicited and obtained

10

 
Case 1:15-cv-05551 Document 1 Filed 09/24/15 Page 11 of 29 PagelD #: 11

approximately $718,000 from at least 37 persons to invest in a forex commodity pool. The
majority of pool funds were deposited into Safetyâs bank account (which was controlled by
Defendant Sungmi Kang). GNS also received in its bank account (controlled by Defendants
John Won and Sungmi Kang) at least $50,000 from a pool participant.

41. Defendant Sungmi Kang was the sole signatory of Safetyâs bank account.
Defendants John Won and Sungmi Kang were both signatories on GNSâs bank account.

42. Defendants Safety and GNS, by and through their officers, employees or agents,
represented to pool participants that they would use pool funds to trade retail off-exchange forex
transactions on behalf of the participants. In fact, the majority of pool funds were not used for
forex trading but for Defendantsâ personal and business expenses.

43, Defendants Sungmi Kang and John Won, through their control over Safetyâs and
GNSâs bank accounts, misappropriated over $622,000 in pool participantsâ funds for personal
and business expenses, including cash withdrawals, checks to their personal bank accounts,
entertainment and meals, and Ponzi payments (i.e., payments of purported trading profits to
investors using funds of other investors). In total, Defendants Safety and GNS, collectively, paid
at least $80,000 in Ponzi payments.

44, Defendants, either directly or as controlling persons, did not disclose to the pool
participants that the majority of their funds were actually misappropriated and never used for
forex trading. Defendants John Won and Sungmi Kang knew or should have known the majority
of pool funds were misappropriated and not used for forex trading because they controlled Safety

and GNSâs bank accounts and trading.

11

 
Case 1:15-cv-05551 Document 1 Filed 09/24/15 Page 12 of 29 PagelD #: 12

45. During the Relevant Period and using the same false solicitations described
above, Defendants Safety and GNS, by and through their officers, employees and agents, also
solicited retail customers to open managed forex trading accounts with an FCM,

46. Safety and GNS received commissions for managing these retail forex accounts.

47, All or nearly all of Safety and GNSâs retail forex customers were not ECEs ot
ECPs as defined by Sections 1a(17)-(18) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1a(17)-(18).

48. Defendants Safety and GNSâs retail forex customers deposited a total of
approximately $845,000 into their managed retail forex accounts and lost nearly $400,000
(including commissions and fees) through trading of retail forex transactions. At the same time,
Safety and GNS made commissions on these managed retail forex accounts.

B. Commingling Pool Funds and Failure to Operate Pool as Separate Entity

49, Safety and GNS, while acting as CPOs, also failed to operate their commodity
pool as a separate legal entity, and commingled pool funds with non-pool property by depositing
pool funds into the bank accounts of Safety and GNS rather than a separate bank account for the
pool.

C. Defendantsâ Failure to Register With the Commission

50. During the Relevant Period, Defendants Safety and GNS, by and through their
officers, employees or agents, used the mails, emails, wire transfers, the FOREXNPOWER
website, newspaper advertisements and other means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce,
to solicit pool participants and prospective pool participants, and misappropriated pool
participantsâ funds that were deposited in bank accounts controlled by Safety and GNS.

51. Safety was never registered as a CPO, and GNS became a registered CPO (and

CTA) only on or about October 21, 2013. During the Relevant Period, Safety, and GNS (prior to

12

 
Case 1:15-cv-05551 Document 1 Filed 09/24/15 Page 13 of 29 PagelD #: 13

its registration on or about October 21, 2013) acted as CPOs by soliciting and accepting pool
funds.

52. During the Relevant Period, Safety and GNS (during its unregistered period) were
not statutorily exempt or excluded from registration as CPOs, Moreover, Safety and GNS never
filed any electronic or written notice with NFA that they were exempt or excluded from
registration as CPOs, as required by Commission Regulation 4.13(b)(1).

53. In addition, Defendants Safety and GNS also acted as CTAs by collectively
managing the retail forex trading accounts of at least 55 clients.

54. During the Relevant Period, Safety and GNS acted as CTAs by providing retail
forex trading advice for compensation or profit, and used the mails, emails, or other means or
instrumentality of interstate commerce to solicit retail forex customers and manage retail forex
accounts, Safety had trading authority over at least five such client accounts and GNS had
trading authority over at least 50 such client accounts.

55. During the Relevant Period, Safety and GNS (prior to October 21, 2013) were not
registered with the Commission as CTAs, nor were Safety and GNS exempt or excluded from
registration as CTAs. Moreover, even if they were eligible for exemption or exclusion from
registration, Safety and GNS never filed written or electronic notice with NFA that they were
exempt or excluded from registration as CTAs.

D. Controlling Person Liability

56. Defendant Sungmi Kang was a controlling person of Safety during the Relevant

Period. Sungmi Kang was the President of Safety and was the sole signatory on Safetyâs bank

account, Sungmi Kang also had trading authority over Safetyâs managed retail forex accounts.

13

 
Case 1:15-cv-05551 Document 1 Filed 09/24/15 Page 14 of 29 PagelD #: 14

57. During the Relevant Period, Defendant Sungmi Kang did not act in good faith by
misappropriating Safety customer funds or knowingly induced Safety, its officers, employees or
agents, to make the misrepresentations described above about guaranteed profits without risk of
loss. Sungmi Kang knew or should have known that Safetyâs customers had never obtained 10%
profits per month and that she had been misappropriating customer funds. Sungmi Kang failed
to remove or correct Defendantsâ misrepresentations and failed to disclose the misappropriation
of customer funds.

58. During the Relevant Period, Defendants John Won and Sungmi Kang were
controlling persons of GNS. GNS was formed by John Won. John Won was the President and
Sungmi Kang was the Vice-President of GNS. Both John Won and Sungmi Kang were
signatories on GNSâs bank account, and John Won had trading authority over the retail forex
trading accounts managed by GNS.

59. Defendants John Won and Sungmi Kang did not act in good faith by
misappropriating GNS customer funds and depositing the funds into GNSâs bank account, or
knowingly induced GNS and its officers, employees or agents to make the misrepresentations
described above about guaranteed profits without risk of loss. John Won and Sungmi Kang
knew or should have known that GNSâs customers had never obtained 10% profits per month
and that they had been misappropriating customer funds. John Won and Sungmi Kang failed to
remove or correct Defendantsâ misrepresentations and failed to disclose the misappropriation of
customer funds.

E. GNSâs Failure to Respond to a CFTC Subpoena
60, In April 2014, the Commissionâs Division of Enforcement served, via UPS

overnight delivery and email, an administrative subpoena (returnable on August 4, 2014) for

14

 
Case 1:15-cv-05551 Document 1 Filed 09/24/15 Page 15 of 29 PagelD #: 15

documents on GNS, at both its registered business address and at the home address of Defendant
John Won, GNSâs President. At the time, GNS was registered with the Commission as a CPO
and CTA and John Won was its principal.

61. | John Won verbally acknowledged to Commission staff that he had received the
subpoena to GNS. However, GNS and its principal, John Won, failed to produce documents or
~ otherwise respond to the Commissionâs subpoena, and John Won did not act in good faith or
knowingly induced GNSâs failure to comply with the Commission subpoena.

(C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6b(a)(2)(A) and (C), and Commission Regulation 5.2(b)(1) and (3), 17

personal and business expenses rather than for forex trading.

69, The foregoing acts, omissions, and failures occurred within the scope of John
Won, Sungmi Kang, and Tae Hung Kangâs employment or office with Safety and/or GNS.

74, During the Relevant Period, Safety and GNS engaged in a business, for
compensation or profit, that is of the nature of a commodity pool, investment trust, syndicate, or
similar form of enterprise, and in connection therewith, solicited, accepted, or received from
others, funds, securities, or property, either directly or through capital contributions, the sale of
stock or other forms of securities, or otherwise, for the purpose of trading in commodity
interests, including in relevant part transactions in foreign currency. Therefore, Safety and GNS
acted as CPOs as defined by Section la(11) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ la(11).

75. An Associated Person (âAPâ) of a CPO is defined by Regulation 1.3(aa)(3) as any

a similar status or performing similar functions), in any capacity which involves (i) the
solicitation of funds, securities, or property for a participation in a commodity pool or (ii) the
supervision of any person or persons so engaged. An AP of a CTA is defined by Regulation

person occupying a similar status or performing similar functions), in any capacity which
involves: (i) the solicitation of a client's or prospective client's discretionary account, or (ii) the

Therefore, Safety and GNS acted as CTAs as defined by Section 1a(i2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§
la(12).

77, During the Relevant Period, Safety, and GNS (prior to October 21, 2013), were
not registered with the Commission as either CPOs or CTAs.

78. Section 40(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 60(1), prohibits CTAs and CPOs, and APs of
CTAs and CPOs, whether registered with the Commission or not, from using the mails or any
means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, directly or indirectly, from (A) employing
devices, schemes or artifices to defraud any client or participant or prospective client or
participant, and/or (B) engaging in transactions, practices, or courses of business which operated
as a fraud or deceit upon any client or participant or prospective client or participant.

their officers, agents or employees, knowingly or recklessly: (1) misrepresented to pool
participants and retail forex clients that they were guaranteed to make 10% profits per month
trading without risk of loss; (2) misrepresented to pool participants and retail forex customers
that they would obtain $100,000 in profit on a $500 investment, among other misrepresentations;
and (3) misappropriated customer funds; and (4) omitted to disclose these misappropriations.

customers and prospective customers.

81. The foregoing acts, omissions, and failures of Defendants John Won, Sungmi
Kang, and Tae Hung Kang occurred within the scope of their employment or office with Safety
and GNS. Therefore, Safety and GNS are liable for their acts, omissions, and failures pursuant
to Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, as amended, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(a)(1)(B), and Regulation 1.2, 17
C.F.R. Â§ 1.2.

82. Defendant Sungmi Kang held and exercised direct and indirect control over
Safety and either did not act in good faith or knowingly induced Safetyâs violations of Section
40(1)(A)-(B), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 60(1)(A)-(B). As a controlling person of Safety, Sungmi Kang is liable
for Safetyâs violations of the Act and Regulations, pursuant to Section 13(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
Â§ 13c(b).

83. Defendants John Won and Sungmi Kang held and exercised direct and indirect

commingling the property of the pool with property of Defendants or others,

(Failure to Register as Retail Forex CPOs and CTAs)

97, Paragraphs | through 96 are re-alleged and incorporated herein by reference.

98. During the Relevant Period, Safety and GNS engaged in a business, for
compensation or profit, that is of the nature of a commodity pool, investment trust, syndicate, or
similar form of enterprise, and in connection therewith, solicited, accepted, or received from
others, funds, securities, or property, either directly or through capital contributions, the sale of
stock or other forms of securities, or otherwise, for the purpose of trading in commodity
interests, including in relevant part transactions in foreign currency. Therefore, Safety and GNS
acted as CPOs as defined by Section 1a(11) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1a(11).

99, During the Relevant Period, Safety, and GNS (prior to October 21, 2013), while
using the mails or means of interstate commerce in connection with their business as CPOs, were
not registered with the Commission as CPOs. Thus, Safety, and GNS (prior to October 21,
2013), acted as unregistered CPOs in violation of Section 4m(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6m(1).

100. During the Relevant Period, Safety and GNS solicited funds, securities, or
property for a pooled investment vehicle from investors who were not eligible contract

forex transactions (as defined by Regulation 5.1(m), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 5.1(m)). Thus, Safety and GNS
acted as CPOs engaged in retail forex transactions as defined by Regulation 5.1(d)(1), 17 C.F.R.
5.1(d)(1), and were not otherwise exempt or excluded from registration as CPOs. Because

Safety and GNS were not registered with the Commission as CPOs engaged in retail forex

transactions, they violated Regulation 5.3(a)(2)(i), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 5.3(a)(2)@).

others, for compensation or profit, either directly or through publications, writings, or electronic
media, as to the value of or the advisability of trading in any contract of sale of a commodity for
future delivery, security futures product, forex contract or swap for compensation or profit, thus
Safety and GNS acted as CTAs as defined by Section la(12) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1a(12),

102. During the Relevant Period, Safety and GNS made use of the mails or other
means of interstate commerce in connection with their CTA and CPO businesses and were not
otherwise exempt or excluded from registration as CTAs or CPOs. Because Safety and GNS
(prior to October 21, 2013) were not registered as CTAs, they violated Section 4m(1) of the Act,
7 U.S.C. Â§ 6m(1).

103. During the Relevant Period, Safety and GNS exercised discretionary trading
authority over retail forex transactions of persons who were neither ECEs nor ECPs as defined
by Section 1a(17) and (18) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ La(17) and (18), and thus acted as CTAs
engaged in retail forex transactions as defined by Regulation 5,1(e)(1), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 5.1(e)(1).
Because Safety and GNS (prior to October 21, 2013) were not registered as retail forex CTAs or
CPOs, they violated Regulation 5.3(a)(3)(i), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 5.3(@)G)@).

104. Sungmi Kang held and exercised direct and indirect control over Safety and either
did not act in good faith or knowingly induced Safetyâs violations of Section 4m(1) of the Act, 7
U.S.C. Â§ 6m(1), and Regulation 5.3(a)(3)(i), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 5.3(a)(3)(i).. As a controlling person
pursuant to Section 13(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13c(b), Sungmi Kang is liable for Safetyâs
violations of the Act and Regulations.

105. Defendants John Won and Sungmi Kang held and exercised direct and indirect

Violation of Regulation 1.31, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.31.
(Failure to Produce Documents Upon Request from the CFTC)

106. Paragraphs 1 through 105 are re-alleged and incorporated herein by reference.

107. Regulation 1.31, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.31, requires a registrant, inter alia, to open its
books and records to inspection by any representative of the Commission and produce its books
and records in a form specified by any representative of the Commission. Such production shall
be made at the expense of the person required to keep the book or record, to a Commission
representative upon the representative's request.

108. From October 21, 2013 to the present, GNS has been registered with the
Commission as a CTA and CPO.

109. On or about July 24, 2014, the Commissionâs Division of Enforcement served a
document subpoena on GNS (returnable on August 4, 2014). John Won, the principal of GNS,
acknowledged receipt of this subpoena to Commission staff. However, GNS never responded to
the subpoena or produced its books and records, and thus GNS violated Commission Regulation
1.31,17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.31,

110. John Won, who controlled the bank and trading accounts of GNS, held and
exercised direct and indirect control over GNS and either did not act in good faith or knowingly
induced GNSâs violations of Regulation 1.3, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.3. John Won is therefore also liable
for GNSâs violations as a controlling person pursuant to Section 13(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§

13c(b).
