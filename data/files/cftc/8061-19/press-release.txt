CFTC Charges New York Man with Misappropriating Customer Funds Intended for Futures
and Forex Trading

Washington, D.C. - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced the filing of a civil enforcement
action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Eyal Alper of Tarrytown, New York, for
fraud and misappropriating funds.

The CFTCâs complaint charges Alper with defrauding members of the public by fraudulently soliciting them to trade
futures and/or forex contracts through accounts purportedly managed by Alper, and misappropriating at least $280,000
of the funds provided to him for these purposes.

According to the complaint, Alper improperly commingled the customersâ funds with his own funds, never opened trading
accounts for his customers as promised, and sent false statements to his customers reporting purported profits in the
fictitious accounts.

In its continuing litigation against Alper, the CFTC seeks restitution to defrauded customers, disgorgement of ill-gotten
gains, civil monetary penalties, permanent registration and trading bans, and a permanent injunction against future
violations of federal commodities laws, as charged.

The CFTC thanks and acknowledges the assistance of the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority.
The Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Alan Edelman, Kara Mucha, Daniel Jordan, and
Rick Glaser.
