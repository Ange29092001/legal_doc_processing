Plaintiff, Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCFTCâ), an independent federal

agency, by and through its attorneys, alleges as follows:
I. SUMMARY

1. From at least late 2015 through the present (the âRelevant Periodâ), Eyal Alper
(âAlperâ) defrauded members of the public by fraudulently soliciting them to trade commodity
futures (âfuturesâ) and/or retail foreign currency on a leveraged or margined basis (âretail
forexâ) through accounts managed by Alper, and then misappropriating the funds provided to
him for these purposes.

2. Alper solicited at least nine customers through telephone and face-to-face
conversations. Alperâs solicitations to these customers contained numerous misrepresentations,
including that: (1) he was an experienced and successful trader; (2) he controlled a large-dollar
master account at FxPro, a United Kingdom (âUKâ)-based trading firm, that allowed him to open
subaccounts on behalf of customers; and (3) he would open an individual subaccount for each

customer and use that subaccount to trade futures and/or retail forex on their behalf.
Case 7:19-cv-09832 Document1 Filed 10/24/19 Page 2 of 14

3. Alper instructed customers to send their money to him directly. During the
Relevant Period, Alper received more than $280,000 from customers in principal and
commission payments, which was deposited into a bank account controlled by Alper.

4. Alper did not open subaccounts for his customers and did not trade futures and/or
tetail forex on their behalf. Rather, Alper misappropriated his customersâ funds and used those
funds to pay for his personal expenses.

5. To cover up his misappropriation of customer funds, Alper sent false statements
to his customers, which purported to show that their accounts were making profits. Alper also
charged his customers a commission of approximately thirty percent (30%) based on their
purported profits, which he asked some of them to pay to him separately rather than have it taken
out of their profits.

6. At various times during the Relevant Period, each of the nine customers requested
to withdraw funds from his account. In some instances, Alper failed to respond at all to a
customerâs request. In other instances, Alper responded with various false excuses as to why he
could not immediately comply with the request. Among the excuses that Alper made to
customers as to why he could not comply with their withdrawal requests were that: (1) the
Securities and Exchange Commission (âSECâ) was auditing his books; (2) his accounts were
frozen; and (3) the money was stuck overseas. Alper continued either to ignore customersâ
withdrawal requests or to make excuses to customers until they gave up on getting their money
back. Alper has never returned any money to any of these nine customers in response to their

tequests for withdrawals.
Case 7:19-cv-09832 Document1 Filed 10/24/19 Page 3 of 14

7. Most, if not all, of Alperâs customers were not eligible contract participants
(âECPsâ) under Section 1a(18)(A)(xi) of the Commodity Exchange Act (the âActâ), 7 U.S.C.
Â§ 1a(18)(A)(xi) (2012).

8. By this conduct and the conduct further described herein, Alper has engaged, is
engaging, and/or is about to engage in acts and practices in violation of Sections 4b(a)(2)(A)-(C)
and 40(1)(A) and (B) of the Commodity Exchange Act (the âActâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6b(a)(2)(A)-(Â©),
60(1)(A), (B) (2012), and Commission Regulation (âRegulationâ) 5.2(b)(1)-(3), 17 C.F.R.

Â§ 5.2(0)(1)-3)2019).

9. In addition to the above-described illegal conduct, throughout the Relevant Period
Alper, while acting as a commodity trading advisor (âCTAâ), accepted funds from customers in
his own name thereby violating Regulation 4.30(a), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 4.30(a) (2019).

10. Unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, Alper will likely continue to engage
in the acts and practices alleged in this Complaint, or in similar acts and practices, as described
more fully below.

11. Accordingly, pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2012), the
CFTC brings this action to enjoin Alperâs unlawful acts and practices, to compel his compliance
with the Act and Regulations, and to enjoin him from engaging in commodity-related activity.
In addition, the CFTC seeks civil monetary penalties, restitution, and remedial ancillary relief,
including, but not limited to, disgorgement, pre- and post-judgment interest, rescission, and such
other and further relief as the Court may deem necessary and appropriate.

I. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

12. The Court has jurisdiction of this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1331 (2012)
(codifying federal question jurisdiction) and 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1345 (2012) (providing that U.S.

district courts have original jurisdiction over civil actions commenced by the United States or by

3
Case 7:19-cv-09832 Document1 Filed 10/24/19 Page 4 of 14

any agency expressly authorized to sue by Act of Congress). In addition, Section 6c of the Act,
7US.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2012), provides that United States district courts possess jurisdiction to hear
actions brought by the CFTC for injunctive relief or to enforce compliance with the Act
whenever it shall appear to the CFTC that such person has engaged, is engaging, or is about to
engage in any act or practice constituting a violation of any provision of the Act or any rule,
regulation, or order thereunder. Section 2(c)(2)(C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(c)(2)(C) (2012),
provides the CFTC with jurisdiction over the retail forex solicitations and transactions at issue in
this action.

13. Venue properly lies with this Court pursuant to 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(e) because Alper
resides in this District and transacts or transacted business in this District, and certain
transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business alleged in this Complaint occurred or are
occurring, or are about to occur within this District, among other places.

iil. THE PARTIES

14. Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an independent federal
tegulatory agency charged by Congress with the administration and enforcement of the Act, 7
US.C. Â§Â§ 1-26 (2012), and the Regulations promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. pts. 1-190
(2019). The CFTC maintains its principal office at Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street
N.W., Washington, D.C. 20581.

15. Defendant Eyal Alper is an individual who resides in Tarrytown, New York.
Alper has held himself out as a retail forex trader with Alper Management Inc. Alper has never
been registered with the CFTC.

Iv. FACTS

16. During the Relevant Period, Alper solicited at least nine customers to trade

futures and/or retail forex through accounts managed by him. Alperâs solicitations occurred

4
Case 7:19-cv-09832 Document1 Filed 10/24/19 Page 5 of 14

primarily in telephone conversations with customers; however, in some instances, Alper met
face-to-face with customers.

17. During the course of his solicitations, Alper stated or implied to customers that he
was an experienced and successful trader. He told at least one customer that he had been trading
for five to seven years and that after losing money early in his career, he had not had a down
month in many years and that he had experienced double digit growth. He stated to another
customer that he had taken an account of approximately $40,000 and grown that into $400,000.

18. In fact, Alper has not had an active or even a funded futures or retail forex trading
account at any domestic futures commission merchant (âFCMâ) or retail foreign exchange dealer
(âRFEDâ) since at least as far back as January 2014.

19. Alper also stated or implied to customers that he controlled a large-dollar trading
account at FxPro, a UK-based trading firm; he told some customers that the account was over $1
million. Alper told customers that because of the size of his account, he was able to open sub-
accounts on their behalf under his master account.

20. In fact, Alper never had an account or any subaccounts at FxPro, and it has been
the policy at FxPro since 2010 not to accept accounts from U.S. customers.

21. â Alper told customers that if they invested their money with him, he would put that
money into a sub-account under his master account at FxPro and trade futures and/or retail forex
on a discretionary basis on their behalf. Alper said that he would charge a commission of
approximately thirty percent (30%) of any profits achieved. In addition, Alper offered at least
some customers a cash bonus on top of their profits if they kept their money with Alper for at

least six months.
Case 7:19-cv-09832 Document1 Filed 10/24/19 Page 6 of 14

22. On the basis of Alperâs representations, at least nine customers sent money to
Alper to trade on their behalf during the Relevant Period. Alper instructed customers to send
their funds not to FxPro, but directly to him, via check, wire, bank transfer, or direct deposit.
Customersâ funds were deposited to bank accounts controlled by Alper.

23. â Insoliciting customers, Alper made no attempt to determine if they were eligible
contract participants (âECPsâ) under Section 1a(18)(A)(xi) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1a(18)(A)(xi)
(2012). In fact, most, if not all, of Alperâs customers were not ECPs.

24. Alper never transferred any of the funds received from his customers into
subaccounts at FxPro or into accounts at any domestic FCM or RFED for trading futures or retail
forex. Contrary to the representations made to his customers, Alper misappropriated his
customersâ funds and used them to pay for his personal expenses. For example, during the
Relevant Period, Alper made numerous cash withdrawals from a bank account into which
customer funds had been deposited, as well as numerous transfers from that account to his
personal bank account. In addition, Alper used the funds in that bank account to pay for, among
other things, international travel, restaurants, and car rentals.

25. To conceal his misappropriation, Alper sent false statements to his customers
which purported to show that their accounts were making profits. These statements consisted of
screenshots sent to customers via text message which purported to show the customerâs balance,
equity, margin level, and gains/losses on various trades of futures and/or retail forex. The
statements did not contain the name of FxPro on them; nor did they contain an account number.
Indeed, Alper never provided his customers with their account numbers. The statements were

not dated; nor did they provide the date on which the purported trades listed were made.
Case 7:19-cv-09832 Document1 Filed 10/24/19 Page 7 of 14

26. Despite the fact that no customer funds were ever transferred to FxPro, the
statements sent to customers showed that their accounts were making profits. On the basis of
these false statements, Alper calculated and claimed his commission from his customers. Rather
than take his commission from the purported profits made by his customersâ accounts, Alper
convinced some of his customers to send additional funds to his bank account to pay his
commission. During the Relevant Period, Alper received more than $280,000 from customers in
principal and commission payments.

27. At various times during the Relevant Period, each of the nine customers sought to
withdraw funds from his account. In some instances, Alper failed to respond at all to a
customerâs request. In other instances, Alper responded with various false excuses as to why he
could not immediately comply with the request. Among the excuses that Alper made to
customers as to why he could not comply with their withdrawal requests were that: (1) the SEC
was auditing his books; (2) his accounts were frozen; and (3) the money was stuck overseas.
Alper continued either to ignore customersâ withdrawal requests or to make excuses to customers
until they gave up on getting their money back. Alper has never returned any money to any of
these nine customers in response to their requests for withdrawals.
