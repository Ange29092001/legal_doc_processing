COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF AND
CIVIL MONETARY PENALTIES UNDER THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT

The United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ or âCFTCâ),
by and through its attorneys, hereby alleges as follows:

SUMMARY

1. Between at least March 2010 through at least August 2013 (the ârelevant
periodâ), Defendant Ryan S. Magee (âRyanâ), of Calgary, Alberta, Canada, fraudulently
solicited and accepted at least $2 million from at least 30 individuals from the United States and
Canada. Ryan misappropriated at least CAD 893,837 of the funds (equivalent to approximately
$653,000 at current exchange rates of roughly 73 cents to the CAD).' Ryan pooled another
portion of the funds to trade commodity futures and other products, losing at least CAD

1,360,348 trading in a brokerage account denominated in Canadian dollars, and at least $13,015

 

Unless specified otherwise, all currency amounts are in U.S. dollars.

1
Case 2:16-cv-00186-LA Filed 02/18/16 Page 1of24 Document 1
in two accounts denominated in U.S. dollars. To hide the losses and misappropriation, Ryan sent
pool participants false account statements that reported non-existent profits.

2. While soliciting and accepting funds, Ryan misrepresented to prospective and
actual participants that he would use their money solely to trade commodity futures and other
products on their behalf, when in fact he misappropriated significant portions of participantsâ
investments. Ryan also fraudulently represented that he had achieved gains of 100-200% in
prior years, and promised annual returns of 200 to 300%, when in reality he had always lost
money trading.

3. Furthermore, by soliciting and accepting money from at least 30 individuals to
engage in trading of commodities futures, Ryan acted as a Commodity Pool Operator (âCPOââ)
without being registered with the Commission as required by law.

4. Defendant David W. Magee (âDavidââ), Ryanâs father, and Defendant Dalyne Rae
Magee (âDalyneââ), Ryanâs wife, solicited funds for the pool and handled participant monies
while associated with Ryan as his partner, employee, or agent (or while occupying a similar
status or performing similar functions). David and Dalyne therefore acted as associated persons
(âAPsâ) of Ryan during the relevant time period without being registered with the Commission
as required by law.

5. By engaging in this conduct and the conduct further described herein, Ryan has
engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in acts and practices that violate Sections 4b(a)(1)(A)
and (C), 4b(a)(1)(B), 401), 6(c)(1), 4m(1), and 4k(2) of the Commodity Exchange Act (the
âActâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6b(a)(1)(A) and (C), 6(b)(1)(1)(B), 60(1), 9(1), 6m(1), and 6(k)(2) (2012),

and Commission Regulation 180.1(a)(1)-(3), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 180.1(a)(1)-(3) (2014), and David and

Dalyne have engaged, are engaging, or are about to engage in acts and practices that violate
Section 4k(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6(k)(2) (2012).

6. Accordingly, pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-l (2012), the
Commission brings this action to enjoin Defendantsâ unlawful acts and practices and to compel their
compliance with the Act. In addition, the Commission seeks civil monetary penalties and remedial
ancillary relief, including, but not limited to, trading and registration bans, disgorgement, restitution,
pre- and post-judgment interest, and such other relief as the Court may deem necessary and
appropriate.

7. Unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, Defendants are likely to continue to
engage in the acts and practices alleged in this Complaint and similar acts and practices, as more fully
described below.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

8. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 6c(a) of the Act,
7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-l(a) (2012), which authorizes the Commission to seek injunctive relief against any
person whenever it shall appear that such person has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in
any act or practice that violates any provision of the Act or any rule, regulation, or order promulgated
thereunder.

9. Venue properly lies with this Court pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
Â§13a-1(e) (2012), because Defendants transacted business in this District, and certain of the acts
and practices in violation of the Act have occurred, are occurring, or are about to occur within
this District, among other places.

14. Non-party Master Daytraders Inc. is an Alberta corporation with its registered
office located at 304 8th Avenue SW, in Calgary, Alberta T2P 1C2. It was incorporated in
Alberta, Canada on October 23, 2009, and David and Ryan are its sole directors and
shareholders. At various times, Defendants used the name âMaster Daytraders Inc.â or âMaster
Daytradersâ to refer to the pool in communications to participants.

15. Non-party Magee International Incorporated is a Texas corporation with its
registered office located at 701 Brazos Street, Ste. 720, Austin, TX 78701. It was incorporated
on January 20, 2012, and Dalyne is its sole director. At various times, Defendants used the name
âMagee International Inc.â or âMagee Internationalâ to refer to the pool in communications to
participants. Some participants signed a document titled âTrading Fund Acknowledgmentâ
which stated that the âTrading Fund run by Ryan Mageeâ was registered as âMagee International

connection with that regulatory proceeding, Ryan, individually and on behalf of Master
Daytraders Inc., David, and Dalyne, individually and on behalf of Magee International
Incorporated, signed and submitted a âStatement of Admissionsâ dated March 2, 2015. The
Statement of Admissions includes representations that Ryan made false statements to and
otherwise defrauded pool participants and misappropriated at least CAD 893,837 of participantsâ
funds to pay Defendantsâ personal expenses, directly or through other companies owned and
controlled by Ryan and David. The Statement of Admissions also includes an acknowledgement
that the admissions therein âmay be used ... for securities regulatory proceedings in other
jurisdictions.â After a hearing in March 2015, the ASC published its final Decision on
August 26, 2015, which concludes that each of the Defendants illegally acted as dealers contrary
to section 75(1)(a) of the Securities Act (Alberta), illegally distributed securities contrary to
section 110(1) of the Securities Act (Alberta), and that Ryan made materially misleading or
untrue statements contrary to section 92(4.1) and perpetrated a fraud contrary to section 93(b) of
the Securities Act (Alberta).

STATUTORY BACKGROUND

17. Section la(10) of the Act defines a âcommodity poolâ as any investment trust,
syndicate, or similar form of enterprise operated for the purpose of trading in commodity
interests, including any commodity for future delivery, security futures product, swap, or
commodity option. Section la(11)(A)G) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ la(11)(A), in relevant part,
defines a Commodity Pool Operator (âCPOâ) as any person engaged in a business that is of the
nature of a commodity pool, investment trust, syndicate, or similar form of enterprise, and who,
in connection therewith, solicits, accepts, or receives from others, funds, securities, or property,

either directly or through capital contributions, the sale of stock or other forms of securities, or

Case 2:16-cv-00186-LA Filed 02/18/16 Page5of24 Document 1
otherwise, for the purpose of trading in commodity interests, including commodities for future
delivery, security futures products, and swaps.

18. A âparticipantâ is defined in Commission Regulation 4.10(c), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 4.10(c)
(2014), as any person who has any direct financial interest in a commodity pool.

19. Section 4b(a)(1)(A), (B), and (C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6b(a)(1)(A), (B) and (C)
(2012), in relevant part, makes it unlawful for any person in or in connection with any order to
make, or the making of, any contract of sale of any commodity for future delivery that is made,
or to be made, for, on behalf of, or with any other person, that is subject to the rules of a
designated contract market: (A) to cheat or defraud or attempt to cheat or defraud the other
person; (B) willfully to make or cause to be made to the other person any false report or
statement, or willfully to enter or cause to be entered for the other person any false record; or

regard to any order or contract or the disposition or execution of any order or contract, or in
regard to any act of agency performed, with respect to any order or contact for, on behalf of, or
with the other person.

20. Section 40(1)(A) and (B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 60(1)(A) and (B) (2012), makes it
unlawful for a CPO to make use of the mails or any means or instrumentalities of interstate
commerce, directly or indirectly to employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud any
participant or prospective participant; or to engage in any transaction or course of business which
operates as a fraud or deceit upon any participant or prospective participant.

21. Effective August 15, 2011, Section 753 of the Dodd Frank Act amended Section 6(c)
of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 9(1) (Supp. IV 2011), which broadened the CFTCâs anti-fraud jurisdiction

as set out in Regulation 180.1, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1801.1 (2014).

directly or indirectly, to use or employ, or attempt to use or employ, in connection with any
swap, or a contract of sale of any commodity in interstate commerce, or for future delivery on or
subject to the rules of any registered entity, any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance,
in contravention of Regulation 180.1.

employ, any manipulative device, scheme, or artifice to defraud; (2) make, or attempt to make,
any untrue or misleading statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary
in order to make the statements made not untrue or misleading; or (3) engage, or attempt to
engage, in any act, practice, or course of business, which operates or would operate as a fraud or
deceit upon any person.

24. Section 4m(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6m(1) (2012), makes it unlawful for any CPO
to make use of the mails or any means of the instrumentalities of interstate commerce in
connection with its business as a CPO, unless registered under the Act.

person to be associated with a CPO as a partner, officer, employee, consultant, or agent (or any
person occupying a simular status or performing similar functions}, in any capacity that involves
(1) the solicitation of funds, securities, or property for a participation in a commodity pool, or
(11) the supervision of any person or persons so engaged, unless such person is registered with the

Commission under this Act as an associated person (âAPâ) of such CPO.

THE FRAUD

26. Ryan began trading commodity futures for his own account in 2009 or earlier.
Ryan traded in an individual brokerage account that he and David opened with a Canadian
electronic brokerage firm on January 6, 2009 held in Ryanâs and Davidâs names (the âRD
Accountâ). The following year, Ryan, David, and Dalyne began soliciting and accepting funds
for commodity futures trading in the RD Account from family, friends, associates, and members
of the public that Ryan met in online chat rooms on trading websites. Many of the Canadian
participants were Davidâs friends or business associates, or others known to Davidâs friends and
business associates. U.S. participants included family friends of Dalyne located in Texas and
Wisconsin, and individuals that Ryan solicited in online chatrooms.

27. As is detailed below, Ryan told prospective and actual participants that he was an
extremely successful commodity futures trader who had made returns of 100-200% in prior
years. Ryan told participants that he consistently produced trading gains of 1-2% per day, and
that he had lost money trading on only one day in the past two years. Ryan told participants that
they could expect the same results if they invested with him.

28. Ryan solicited prospective pool participants by telling them that their funds would
be used to trade commodity futures, including oil and index futures contracts, and that
participants in the pool would be entitled to 80% of profits from that trading.

29. Ryan described his trading strategy to participants only in general terms, telling
them that he actively traded currency futures, oil futures, index futures, and other products by
âuse[ing] entries based on the momentum of the price going up or downâ and that â[w]e are just
here to ride the wave up or down.â Ryan said that each day, after he produces a 1% profit, he

liquidates his gains and exits the market.

8
Case 2:16-cv-00186-LA Filed 02/18/16 Page 8 of 24 Document 1
30. Ryan traded most participant funds in the RD Account. Ryan traded a smaller
portion of pool participant funds in two other accounts: (1) an individual brokerage account
opened in August 2013 in Ryanâs name at a U.S.-based brokerage firm (âR Accountâ); and
(ii) an individual brokerage account at opened in October 2013 in Dalyneâs name at a different
U.S.-based brokerage firm (âD Accountâ).

31. Participants who invested either delivered checks made out to Ryan or David, or
sent wire transfers the RD Account or to bank accounts held in the name of Ryan and/or David.
On a limited number of occasions, participants sent wire transfers to an account at a bank in the
U.S. held in Dalyneâs name. Ryan then misappropriated the funds to pay Defendantsâ personal
expenses, used them to pay returns to participants who had invested previously, or transferred the
funds to the brokerage accounts to trade.

32. Ryan required some participants to sign a document titled Trading Fund
Acknowledgement (the âAcknowledgmentâ). The Acknowledgment stated that participantsâ
money would be provided to Ryan and to Magee International Inc. to invest on their behalf to
trade stocks, bonds, currencies, and commodities on a daily basis. The Acknowledgment also
stated that Magee International Inc. was âentitled to 20% of the daily profits generated by the
fund.â One version of the Acknowledgment purported to permit Ryan to make all investment
decisions without prior consultation with the participant, and also purported to release Ryan and
David from all claims by participants. The same Acknowledgment required each participant to
ââconfirm[] that he has not been solicited in any manner by Ryan.â

A. Fraudulent Solicitation

33. In order to induce potential participants to invest, or to induce existing participants to
keep their money invested in the pool, Ryan made numerous untrue or misleading statements,

including without limitation the following examples:
a. On August 8, 2011, Ryan e-mailed a prospective participant: âDuring the
day I have a goal of 1-2% of the portfolio. We generally hit this every day.â In that same
communication, Ryan said that his trading was able to produce returns âon average
$20,000.00 - $40,000.00â a month on a $100,000.00 investment (before the 20%
commission). This would equate to an annual trading performance of between 240% and
480%. In reality, an analysis of Ryanâs trading shows that he was not able to produce
gains of 1-2% per day, and in actuality lost more than $1 million between 2009 and 2013.

b. On July 3, 2012, Ryan told a prospective participant via e-mail that his
trading strategy produced gains of â1% a day, 200 times a yearâ which was âbetter than
anyone else was doing.â Ryan further stated that he âtrade[s] with people with more than
$10,000,000.00 [invested with him] and people all the way down to some with
$25,000.00 now with meâ and that he was âat a point now of managing nearly
$50,000,000.00.â In reality, Ryan produced no profits through trading. Further, while
Ryan fraudulently solicited and accepted at least $2 million from participants, the largest
participant contributed only CAD 650,000, not CAD 10,000,000 as Ryan claimed.
Finally, Ryanâs claim that he managed ânearly [CAD] 50,000,000.00â was false; the most
Defendantsâ brokerage accounts were ever worth (on a month-end net asset value basis)
was CAD 733,683 on June 30, 2010.

c. On September 13, 2012, Ryan told a prospective participant via e-mail
that between 2009 and 2012, he experienced âtremendous successâ trading and that â[t]he
last time we lost money or âhad a red dayâ was in December of 2010.â Ryan further
represented that his investments achieved 203% growth in 2010, 234% in 2011, and that

he was âon pace to make 220%â for 2012. He further stated that â[w]e are a registered
investment company in the USA and Canada.â In reality, Defendantsâ trading accounts

lost money every year. The annual rate of return for the RD Account (where the lionsâ

share of Ryanâs trading took place) was negative 51% in 2009, negative 99% in 2010,

and negative 100% in 2011 and 2012. Finally, contrary to Ryanâs claim, neither he,

Master Daytraders Inc., nor Magee International Inc. was registered with the ASC,

CFTC, or any other appropriate authorities either in the U.S. or Canada.

d. On September 30, 2012, Ryan told participants in an e-mail that in the
third quarter of 2012, he profited CAD 19,848,645.11 through trading and paid out
CAD 4,187,212 to fund participants. In reality, in the third quarter of 2012, Ryan lost
CAD 20,487 through trading in the RD Account and withdrew only CAD 25,849 from
the RD Account.

e. In January of 2011, David and Ryan communicated to a group of
participants that Ryan had collapsed in front of his computer while positions were open,
causing the pool to lose nearly all of its value. In reality, losses in the pool in December
2010 and January 2011 were primarily due to Ryanâs withdrawals from the account.

34. David and Dalyne also solicited prospective pool participants. David and Dalyne
each told participants that Ryan was a profitable trader who consistently produced returns of
roughly 1% profit per day.

35. As a result of Defendantsâ solicitations and Ryanâs false representations that his
trading was profitable, at least 30 individuals in the U.S. and Canada invested at least $2 million
in the pool.

B. Misappropriation of Participantsâ Funds

36. Rather than using participantsâ funds solely to trade commodity futures as Ryan

represented he would, of the at least $2 million received during the relevant period, Ryan
misappropriated at least CAD 893,837 to pay the personal expenses of Defendants, directly or
through companies controlled or owned by Ryan and David, including Global Non-Slip
Solutions Inc. (a construction company), Leathermaster (1994) Inc. (a leather cleaning and dry
cleaning business), and Master Reglazing Inc. (a bathtub refinishing and repair business).
During the relevant period, David was a director and shareholder of all three companies, and
Ryan was a shareholder of Master Reglazing Inc., and a director and shareholder of Global Non-
Slip Solutions Inc.

37. Ryan also used at least CAD 100,000 of participantsâ funds to pay returns to
participants who had invested in the pool earlier.

38. Participants did not authorize Ryan to use their funds to pay Defendantsâ expenses
or to pay returns to prior participants.

Cc. False Account Statements

39. In order to perpetuate the fraud, Ryan knowingly provided false account
statements to pool participants that misrepresented the value of their investments. Ryan and
Dalyne distributed the false account statements often on a weekly or monthly basis, usually by e-
mail.

AO. These account statements showed consistent and significant growth in
participantsâ accounts, when in fact participantsâ funds were being depleted by trading losses and
misappropriation. The figures reflected on the account statements were entirely fictitious and
divorced from Ryanâs actual trading performance.

41. Examples of false account statements sent to participants include the following:

a. In late 2010, Ryan sent an account statement to a Canadian participant that
covered the period October to November 2010. The account statement reflected that the

participantâs account had a value of CAD 429,929.82 on October 1, 2010. The statement
purported to show daily and weekly gains achieved through Ryanâs trading. The account
statement reflected trading profits of $61,230.00 between October 1 and November 19,
2010, a profit of 14% over the 7-week period. In reality, the RD Account (the only
brokerage account open at that time) lost over CAD 21,000, or 33% of its total value
during the time period October to November 2010. Furthermore, trading records show
that the pool never had more than CAD 94,000 total under management in October and
November 2010.

b. Ryan sent account statements to a participant located in Reedsburg,
Wisconsin that covered the time period November 2011 to February 2014. The account
statements purported to show that the participantâs account grew to a value of
$700,194.05 by January 1, 2014. Of the total account balance, $120,000 represented the
participantâs capital contributions, with the remaining $580,194.05 reflected as profits
from Ryanâs trading. In reality, from November 2011 through February 2014, Ryan
achieved no trading profits, and losses in the poolâs trading accounts totaled over
$188,000.

c. On August 14, 2013, Ryan e-mailed an account statement to a participant
located in Sheboygan, Wisconsin that covered the time period January 1, 2013 to
August 16, 2013. The account statement purported to show that the participantâs account
balance was $43,597.47 on January 1, 2013. The statement purported to show
$63,913.98 in profits from Ryanâs trading over the next seven months, reflecting an
account balance of $107,511.45 on August 9, 2013. In reality, the pool trading account

had less than $100 under management as of January 1, 2013. Furthermore, from
January 1, 2013 through August 31, 2013, the pool incurred nearly $29,000 in trading

losses in its trading accounts.

42. In the account statements, Ryan misrepresented and omitted material facts
regarding the performance of his trading in order to induce participants to maintain their funds
with him, to invest additional funds, and to persuade others to become participants. The false
account statements gave participants the false impression that they had access to the funds in
these trading accounts and could withdraw the funds at their discretion.

43. Defendants engaged in the acts and practices described above knowingly or with
reckless disregard for the truth.

67. With certain exemptions and exclusions not applicable here, Section 4m(1) of the
Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6m(1) (2012) requires all CPOs to be registered with the Commission.

68. During the relevant period, Ryan acted as a CPO in that he engaged in a business
that is of the nature of an investment trust, syndicate or similar form of enterprise operated for
the purpose of trading in commodity interests or commodity futures, and in connection
therewith, solicited, accepted and received funds from others for the purpose of trading in
commodity interests and commodity futures.

COUNT VI
FAILURE TO REGISTER AS APs AND
ALLOWING UNREGISTERED APs TO REMAIN ASSOCIATED WITH A CPO
VIOLATIONS OF SECTION 4k(2) OF THE ACT
Against All Defendants

72. The allegations set forth in paragraphs | through 43 and 66 through 71 are re-
alleged and incorporated herein by reference.

73. Section 4k(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6k(2) (2012), requires that APs of CPOs be
registered with the Commission. Further, a CPO violates Section 4k(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
Â§ 6k(2) (2012), when it allows an unregistered AP to become or remain associated with the CPO
when the CPO knew or should have known that the AP was not registered as such with the
Commission.

74, David and Dalyne acted as APs when each solicited funds for the pool and handled
participant monies while associated with Ryan as his partner, employee, or agent (or while
occupying a similar status or performing similar functions). David and Dalyne were never
registered with the Commission.

75. Because they engaged in their AP activities without registering as APs of a CPO,

David and Dalyne violated Section 4k(2) of the Act.
76. Ryan violated Section 4k(2) of the Act, by allowing David and Dalyne to act as
unregistered APs when he knew or should have known that they were not registered with the

Commission.
