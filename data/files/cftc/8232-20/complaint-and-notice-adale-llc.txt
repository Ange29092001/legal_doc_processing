In the Matter of
Adale LLC, CFTC Docket No. 20-50

Respondent.

 

 

COMPLAINT AND NOTICE OF HEARING PURSUANT TO SECTION 6(d)
OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ) has received information

that tends to show, and the Commissionâs Division of Enforcement (âDivisionââ) alleges that:

I SUMMARY

1. From April 11, 2017 through the present (the âRelevant Timeâ), Adale LLC
(âRespondentâ), has been registered with the Commission as a Commodity Trading Advisor
(âCTAâ) without maintaining membership in the National Futures Association (âNFAâ), the
only futures association registered under Section 17 of the Commodity Exchange Act (âActâ),
7 U.S.C. Â§ 21 (2018). Respondent has not claimed any exemption from the NFA membership
requirement during the Relevant Time. Thus, Respondent has violated and is violating
Commission Regulation (âRegulationâ) 170.17, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 170.17 (2019), which provides that
each registered CTA, unless eligible for certain exemptions, âmust become and remain a

memberâ of a registered futures association, namely NFA.

Il. RESPONDENT

2. Respondent does business as Adale LLC and is a registered CTA with NFA ID

number 501451. In registration materials, Respondent provided the following contact
information: mailing address 572 OâFarrell Street, San Francisco, CA 94102; telephone number

(202) 394-8446; and email address shawutia@ gmail.com. Respondent has never been an NFA

member.
Hl. FACTS
3. Respondent has been registered with the Commission as a CTA from April 11,
2017 to the present.
4. NFA is the only futures association that is registered under Section 17 of the Act,

7 U.S.C. Â§ 21 (2018). It is a private corporation that serves as an industry self-regulatory
organization, with membership composed of futures commission merchants, commodity pool
operators, CTAs, introducing brokers and other futures professionals registered with the
Commission. NFA is responsible, under Commission oversight, for certain aspects of the
regulation of these futures entities and their associated persons. NFA focuses primarily on the
qualifications and proficiency, financial condition, retail sales practices, and business conduct of
its members.

5. Respondent has never been an NFA member.

6. Respondent is not currently asserting and has not claimed an exemption from the
requirement that registered CTAs be members of NFA.

7. By registering as a CTA, Respondent appears on NFAâs publicly available
database, BASIC, which provides information about CFTC registrants and those claiming
exemption from registration. By registering as a CTA and being listed on the NFA database, the
Respondent creates an air of legitimacy that can mislead potential clients as it suggests that
Respondent is subject to NFA oversight and is otherwise complying with the regulatory

requirements.
IV. VIOLATIONS OF THE ACT AND COMMISSION REGULATIONS
(COMMISSION REGULATION 170.17)
8. Paragraphs 1 through 7 are realleged and incorporated herein by reference.
9. Regulation 170.17, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 170.17 (2019), requires that each person or entity
registered as a CTA must:

[B]ecome and remain a member of at least one futures association
that is registered under Section 17 of the Act and that provides for
the membership therein of . . . commodity trading advisors . . .
unless no such futures association is so registered; provided,
however that a person registered as a commodity trading advisor
shall not be required to become or remain a member of such a
futures association, solely in respect of its registration as a
commodity trading advisor, if such person is eligible for the
exemption from registration as such pursuant to Â§ 4.14(a)(9) of this
chapter.

10. Respondent violated Regulation 170.17, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 170.17, by failing to obtain

membership in NFA without claiming any exemption to the membership requirement.

V. NECESSITY OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS

By reason of the forgoing allegations, the Commission deems it necessary and
appropriate, pursuant to its responsibilities under the Act, to institute public administrative
proceedings to determine whether the allegations set forth in Part I, I, I, and IV above are true,
and if so, whether an appropriate order should be entered in accordance with Section 6(d) of the
Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13b, (2018), directing Respondent to cease and desist from violating the

provisions of the regulations set forth above.
VI. ADOPTION OF EXPEDITED PROCESS AND APPOINTMENT OF
PRESIDING OFFICER

Upon consideration of the information received from its staff and of the allegations of the
Division of Enforcement contained in paragraphs 1 through 10 above, the Commission finds and
determines that:

A. the issues framed by paragraphs 1 through 10 of the pleadings of this
matter are clear, narrow and capable of speedy resolution;

B. Respondent is alleged to have registered as a CTA without obtaining
membership in NFA or claiming or receiving an exemption from membership in violation
of Regulation 170.17;

C. Respondent and the public are entitled to a prompt decision on the
question of whether Respondent has complied with the requirements of CTA registration;
and

D. this proceeding shall be conducted before a Presiding Officer other than an
Administrative Law Judge.

WHEREAS the Commission has determined that no party to this proceeding will be
prejudiced and that the ends of justice will be served by the adoption of expedited procedures in
this matter, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that a public hearing on the allegations contained in
paragraphs | through 10 of this Complaint be held for the purpose of taking evidence on the
question set forth in Section V above.
