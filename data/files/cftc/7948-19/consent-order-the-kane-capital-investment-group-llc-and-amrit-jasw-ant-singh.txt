Il. FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS
The Court, being fully advised in the premises, finds that there is good cause for the
entry of this Consent Order and that there is no just reason for delay. The Court therefore
directs the entry of the following Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, permanent
injunction and equitable relief pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2012),

as set forth herein.
THE PARTIES AGREE AND THE COURT HEREBY FINDS:
A. Findings of Fact

The Parties to this Consent Order

17. Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an independent federal
regulatory agency charged by Congress with the administration and enforcement of the Act and
Regulations. The Commission maintains its principal office at 1155 21st Street N.W.,
Washington, DC 20581.

18. | Defendant The Kane Capital Investment Group, LLC is a Virginia limited liability
company that Chahal organized on December 14, 2014. Until February 16, 2016, Kane Capital
identified its principal place of business as an office in Fairfax, Virginia. Between February 28,
2016, and March 2, 2017, Kane Capital held National Futures Association (âNFAâ) Pool ID
P111311, which identified Kane Capital as a commodity pool exempt from Commission
registration pursuant to Regulation 4.13(a)(1), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 4.13(a)(1) (2017). On March 2, 2017,
NFA withdrew Kane Capitalâs exempt status.

19. Defendant Amrit Jaswant Singh Chahal is an individual who resides in Fairfax,
Virginia. Chahal is the President, Chief Executive Officer, and Manager of Kane Capital. On

December 14, 2014, Chahal organized Kane Capital by filing articles of organization and related
Case 1:18-cv-00422-LMB-JFA Document 24 Filed 06/20/19 Page 6 of 28 PagelD# 123

papers with the Commonwealth of Virginia State Corporation Commission. Chahal has never
been registered with the Commission in any capacity.

Operation of Kane Capital

20. From at least January |, 2015, through December 31, 2017 (the âRelevant
Periodâ), Chahal opened several commodity futures trading accounts (collectively, the âTrading
Accountsâ), including Interactive Brokers (âIBâ) account *4816 and TD Ameritrade account
*N499, both in the name of Kane Capital, and TradeStation Securities account *8881, in
Chahalâs own name. At all times, Defendants operated and controlled the Trading Accounts.

21. The account opening documents for IB futures trading account *4816 identified
the âTypeâ of account as a âPoolâ account.

22. On September 21, 2016, Chahal opened online bank account *6864 with Ally
Bank in the name of a person identified here as P.C. In May 2017, Chahal opened online bank
account *7334 with Ally Bank in the name of a person identified here as M.T. (together with
account *6864, the âAlly Accountsâ). Neither P.C. nor M.T. authorized Chahal to open bank
accounts in their names, and neither was aware that Chahal had done so. Chahal used the Ally
Accounts to move funds between Kane Capital and his personal bank accounts, to
misappropriate customersâ (âpool participantsâ) funds for Defendantsâ own use, and to make
Ponzi scheme-like payments to certain pool participants. At all times, Defendants operated and
controlled the Ally Accounts.

23. During the Relevant Period, Defendants maintained a public website (the âKane
Capital Websiteâ), which they used to solicit new pool participants and to communicate with
existing pool participants. At all times, Defendants operated and controlled the Kane Capital

Website.
Case 1:18-cv-00422-LMB-JFA Document 24 Filed 06/20/19 Page 7 of 28 PagelD# 124

24. The Kane Capital Website contained a client portal that allowed pool participants
to log in and view their account information, including the balances held in their Kane Capital
accounts.

25. During the Relevant Period, Defendants maintained a public profile for Kane
Capital Group on the LinkedIn.com social media website (the âLinkedIn Pageâ), which they
used to solicit new pool participants to transfer funds to Defendants. At all times, Defendants
operated and controlled the LinkedIn Page.

26. During the Relevant Period, Kane Capital was a Commodity Pool as defined in
Section 1(a)(10) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1(a)(10) (2012), because Kane Capital was an investment
trust, syndicate, or similar form of enterprise operated for the purpose of trading in commodity
interests, including commodity futures contracts.

27. During the Relevant Period, Chahal, without being registered with the
Commission, acted as a Commodity Pool Operator (âCPOâ), as that term is defined in Section
la(11) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1a(11) (2012), by soliciting, accepting, and receiving funds from
the public while engaged in a business that is of the nature of an investment trust, syndicate, or
similar form of enterprise, for the purpose of, among other things, trading in commodity futures
contracts.

28. During the Relevant Period, Chahal was not exempt from registering with the
Commission as a CPO.

Defendantsâ Fraudulent Scheme

29. During the Relevant Period, Chahal used Kane Capital as a vehicle to fraudulently

solicit and misappropriate $1,232,510.41 from approximately 50 pool participants for the
Case 1:18-cv-00422-LMB-JFA Document 24 Filed 06/20/19 Page 8 of 28 PagelD# 125

r

purpose of trading E-mini NASDAQ 100 (NQ), E-mini S&P 500 (ES), Cboe Volatility Index
(VX), and NYMEX WTI Light Sweet Crude Oil (CL) futures contracts, among others.

30. During the Relevant Period, Defendants willfully and knowingly made material
misrepresentations and omissions to pool participants to solicit pool participants to transfer funds
to Defendants, to conceal Defendantsâ futures trading losses, and to prevent pool participants
from detecting Defendantsâ misappropriation of pool participantsâ funds.

31. During the Relevant Period, Defendants made the following material
misrepresentations to pool participants, among others: (a) that Defendantsâ annual trading
returns averaged between 28% and 34% per year, and sometimes higher; (b) that Kane Capital
was managing more than $5 million in pool participantsâ funds; and (c) that âKane Capital
Group uses the latest software to achieve the highest possible profit from each investment,â that
âOur investors are able to gain profit from almost any market condition,â and that âeach of our
investments are carefully reviewed by industry experts.â

32. During the Relevant Period, Defendants made the following material omissions to
pool participants, among others: (a) that Defendants misappropriated pool participantsâ deposits;
(b) that purported trading returns provided to pool participants were actually the misappropriated
principal deposits of other pool participants; and (c) that Chahal was not registered with the
Commission as a CPO, as required by federal law.

33. | Once pool participantsâ funds cleared Defendantsâ bank accounts, Defendants lost
the majority of the funds through unsuccessful futures trades. Defendants misappropriated the
remaining funds for their own use and to make Ponzi scheme-like payments to certain pool

participants.
Case 1:18-cv-00422-LMB-JFA Document 24 Filed 06/20/19 Page 9 of 28 PagelD# 126

34. Defendants falsified account statements to conceal losses and create the illusion
of profitability. As Defendantsâ trading losses mounted, Chahal used a .pdf editing tool to doctor
account statements for the purpose of making Kane Capital appear profitable. Defendants then
uploaded the falsified account statements to the Kane Capital Website, where they were visible
to existing and prospective pool participants. Chahal also provided pool participants with
falsified account statements in person and/or via e-mail when pool participants requested their
Kane Capital statements.

35. | Defendants engaged in the acts and practices alleged above knowingly, willfully,
or with reckless disregard for the truth.

B. Conclusions of Law

Jurisdiction and Venue

36. | The Court possesses jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1331
(2012) (codifying federal question jurisdiction) and 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1345 (2012) (providing that U.S.
district courts have original jurisdiction over civil actions commenced by the United States or by
any agency expressly authorized to sue by Act of Congress). Section 6c(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
Â§ 13a-1(a) (2012), provides that the Commission may bring actions for injunctive relief or to
enforce compliance with the Act or any rule, regulation, or order thereunder in the proper district
court of the United States whenever it shall appear to the Commission that any person has
engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a violation of any
provision of the Act or any rule, regulation, or order thereunder.

37. Venue lies properly in this District pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
Â§ 13a-1(e) (2012), because Defendants reside in, transacted business in, or committed acts and

practices in violation of the Act and Regulations within this District.
Case 1:18-cv-00422-LMB-JFA Document 24 Filed 06/20/19 Page 10 of 28 PagelD# 127

Fraud in Connection with Commodity Futures Contracts
(Violations of Sections 4b(a)(1)(A)-(C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6b(a)(1)(A)-(C) (2012))

38. By performing the acts and omissions set forth in paragraphs 17-35 above,
Defendants violated 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6b(a)(1)(A)-(C) by cheating or defrauding, or attempting to cheat
or defraud, other persons; issuing or causing to be issued false reports, statements, and records;
and willfully deceiving or attempting to deceive other persons in connection with the offering of,
or entering into, commodity futures transactions.

Fraud by a Commodity Pool Operator

(Violations of Section 40(1)(A) and (B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 60(1)(A), (B) (2012) and

Regulation 4.41(a), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 4.41(a) (2018))

39. By performing the acts and omissions set forth in paragraphs 17-35 above,
Defendants violated Section 7 U.S.C. Â§ 60(1)(A) and (B) and 17 C.F.R. Â§ 4.41(a) by using the
mails or other means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce to directly or indirectly employ
a device, scheme, or artifice to defraud actual and prospective pool participants or engage in
transactions, practices, or a course of business which operated or operates as a fraud or deceit

upon pool participants or prospective pool participants.

Commingling Property
(Violations of Regulation 4.20(c), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 4.20(c) (2018))

40. By performing the acts and omissions set forth in paragraphs 17-35 above,
Defendants violated 17 C.F.R. Â§ 4.20(c) by illegally commingling property by transferring pool
participantsâ funds into Chahalâs own personal bank accounts.

Failure to Register as a Commodity Pool Operator
(Violation of Section 4m(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6m(1) (2012))

41. By performing the acts and omissions set forth in paragraphs 17-35, Chahal
violated 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6m(1) by, without being registered with the Commission as required, acting

as a CPO by soliciting, accepting, or receiving funds from the public while engaged in a business

10
Case 1:18-cv-00422-LMB-JFA Document 24 Filed 06/20/19 Page 11 of 28 PagelD# 128

that is of the nature of an investment trust, syndicate, or similar form of enterprise, for the
purpose of, among other things, trading in commodity futures contracts.

Principal and Agent Liability

42. During the Relevant Period, Chahal committed the acts and omissions identified
in paragraphs 17-35 within the course and scope of his employment, agency, or office with Kane
Capital. Pursuant to Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(a)(1)(B) (2012), and Regulation
1.2, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.2 (2018), Kane Capital is liable as principal for Chahalâs violations of the Act
and Regulations identified in paragraphs 17-35.

43. During the Relevant Period, Chahal controlled Kane Capital, directly or
indirectly, and did not act in good faith and knowingly induced, directly or indirectly, Kane
Capital to commit the acts and omissions alleged herein. Therefore, pursuant to Section 13(b) of
the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13c(b) (2012), Chahal is liable as a controlling person for Kane Capitalâs
violations of the Act and Regulations identified in paragraphs 17-35.

44, Unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, this is a reasonable likelihood that
Defendants will continue to engage in the acts and practices alleged in the Complaint and in
similar acts and practices in violation of the Act and Regulations.

Defendant.
STATEMENT OF FACTS

The United States and the defendant, AMRIT JASWANT SINGH CHAHAL, stipulate
that the allegations in Counts Three and Five of the indictment are true and correct. The parties
further stipulate that had the matter gone to trial, the United States would have proven the above
allegations in the Indictment and the following facts beyond a reasonable doubt.

I, Factual Background

l. The Kane Capital Investment Group, LLC (âKane Capitalâ) was a limited liability
company formed in the Commonwealth of Virginia on or about December 14, 2014.

2. Defendant AMRIT JASWANT SINGH CHAHAL (âCHAHALâ) owned and was
the registered agent of Kane Capital. CHAHAL made all or substantially all business decisions
on behalf of Kane Capital, and had complete control over all funds invested with Kane Capital.

3. CHAHAL was a resident of Fairfax, Virginia, within the Eastern District of
Virginia. He managed, directed, and controlled the operations of Kane Capital primarily from

within the Eastern District of Virginia.
Case 1:18-cv-00422-LMB-JFA Document 24 Filed 06/20/19 Page 21 of 28 PagelD# 138

4. CHAHAL held out Kane Capital as a private capital investment group
specializing in absolute investments and as a company that sought to earn profits and investment
returns on behalf of its clients by purchasing, trading, or otherwise investing in commodities for
future delivery, in options on commodities for future delivery, and other financial instruments.

5. CHAHAL maintained a business checking bank eccount for the Kane Capital
Investment Group at Wells Fargo Bank, account number ending in 6437 (âthe Kane Capital
accountâ). The account was opened on or about December 15, 2014. CHAHAL was the sole
Signatory on the account.

6. TradeStation Securities, Inc. (âTradeStationâ) was an online broker through
which account holders could trade securities, commodities for future delivery, and options on
future delivery.

Il. Criminal Conduct

7. As described in greater detail below, from in or around 2015 and continuing
through at least in or around March 2018, in the Eastern District of Virginia, and elsewhere,
defendant AMRIT JASWANT SINGH CHAHAL (âCHAHALâ), having devised and intending
to devise a scheme and artifice to defraud and fraudulently obtain money and property from
investors and potential investors by means of materially false and fraudulent pretenses,
representations, and promises, knowingly transmitted and caused to be transmitted by means of
wire communication in interstate commerce writings, signs, and signals for the purpose of
executing the scheme and artifice.

8. Additionally, as described in greater detail below, from in or around 2015 and

continuing through at least in or around March 2018, in the Eastern District of Virginia, and
Case 1:18-cv-00422-LMB-JFA Document 24 Filed 06/20/19 Page 22 of 28 PagelD# 139

elsewhere, defendant AMRIT JASWANT SINGH CHAHAL, did knowingly devise and intend
to devise a scheme and artifice to defraud any person in connection with any commodity for
future delivery, and in connection with any option on a commodity for future delivery.

9. More specifically, it was the purpose of CHAHALâs scheme to obtain and retain
funds from investors in Kane Capital through false and fraudulent representations to investors
and by concealment of material facts. CHAHAL made false and fraudulent representations to
investors about (i) the historical performance of Kane Capital, (ii) the true disposition of funds
investors provided to Kane Capital, (iii) the true status of investorsâ funds with Kane Capital
relating to commodities for future delivery and options on commodities for future delivery, and
(iv) the source of returns he provided to some investors.

10. _ In connection with his representations regarding the historical performance of
Kane Capital, CHAHAL knowingly made false statements to investors and potential investors in
which he substantially overstated the amount of assets under management by Kane Capital. For
example, on or about November 6, 2017, Chahal represented to Investor MAT that Kane Capital
averaged âbetween like 28% to 30, 34% return per year . . . usually more, but I like to average it
out,â and that Kane Capital was then âmanaging just over $5,000,000.â As Chahal knew, these
statements to Investor MAT were false.

11. In addition, CHAHAL created false and fraudulent statements that he provided to
investors by text message, email, and through the Kane Capital website. These fraudulent
Statements led investors to believe falsely that their investments with Kane Capital were
performing well when, as CHAHAL knew, the funds had suffered substantial losses. Some

investors received statements for entirely fictitious accounts that CHAHAL knew never existed.
Case 1:18-cv-00422-LMB-JFA Document 24 Filed 06/20/19 Page 23 of 28 PagelD# 140

_

12. For example, on or about November 14, 2016, Investor MAT invested $30,000
with Kane Capital. CHAHAL never informed Investor MAT that CHAHAL failed to invest
MAT?âs funds. Instead, over the next several months, CHAHAL represented to Investor MAT
that his or her investment was performing well. Based on those representations, Investor MAT
sent a check to TradeStation Securities in the amount of $150,000, on or about March 24, 2017,
to open an account in the name of Investor MAT and his or her spouse. Investor MAT authorized
CHAHAL to conduct trades and manage the account on behalf of Investor MAT.

13. Once the account opened, CHAHALâs trading suffered substantial losses. To
conceal the true status of the investments, CHAHAL provided Investor MAT with fake and
fraudulent TradeStation documents. Specifically, on or about November 6, 2017, CHAHAL sent
two forged documents to Investor MAT from Fairfax, Virginia, within the Eastern District of
Virginia.

a. The first fraudulent document purported to show that Investor MATâs account
had a balance of $206,043.63 as of October 27, 2017. As CHAHAL knew,
Investor MATâs TradeStation account had an actual balance of $1,043.63 as of
October 27, 2017. CHAHAL never informed Investor MAT that he had lost,
spent, or misappropriated Investor MATâs funds.

b. The second fraudulent document purported to be a TradeStation statement for
another account that purported to show a balance of $71,077.93 as of October 27,
2017. As CHAHAL knew, that account did not hold funds and thus could not

have the purported $71,077.93.
Case 1:18-cv-00422-LMB-JFA Document 24 Filed 06/20/19 Page 24 of 28 PagelD# 141

14. | CHAHAL also concealed that he lacked funds to pay investors when they
requested payment by, in some instances, paying out returns to old investors using funds from
newer investors. CHAHAL never told the newer investors that a portion of their funds was being
used to pay old investors, and CHAHAL never disclosed to old investors that funds they were
being paid came, at least in part, from newer investors.

15. For example, on or about August 1, 2017, Investor JSG invested $25,000 with
Kane Capital intending those funds to be used solely to make investments on his or her behalf.
CHAHAL deposited those funds into the Kane Capital account that same day. By the end of the
day, on August 1, 2017, the Kane Capital account had a balance of $27,414.66 (including the
$25,000 provided to CHAHAL by Investor JSG). On or about August 2, 2017, CHAHAL wrote
two checks to Investor JSC for a total of $15,000 using a portion of the money CHAHAL
received from Investor JSG. CHAHAL never informed Investor JSG that he used a portion of his
or her money to pay another investor, and he never informed Investor JSC that the âreturnâ
Investor JSC received from CHAHAL came in large part from Investor JSG.

16. | CHAHAL further removed funds from accounts in his control without the prior
knowledge or authorization of his investors.

17. For example, from on or about March 27, 2015, through on or about June 11,
2015, Investor DST provided CHAHAL with an initial investment of $55,000. It was the purpose
of this investment for Investor DST to instruct CHAHAL on specific trades to make on Investor
DSTâs behalf and for CHAHAL to keep Investor DST apprised of the status of the trades.
Without Investor DSTâs prior knowledge or approval, CHAHAL spent a portion of Investor

DSTâs funds on his personal expenses and diverted a portion of Investor DSTâs funds to other
Case 1:18-cv-00422-LMB-JFA Document 24 Filed 06/20/19 Page 25 of 28 PagelD# 142

accounts in CHAHALâs control. Based on representations CHAHAL made about the success of
his trades, Investor DST continued to invest with CHAHAL. On or about October 8, 2015, and
October 9, 2015, Investor DST wrote checks totaling $100,000 to Kane Capital which CHAHAL
deposited into the Kane Capital account with Wells Fargo on or about October 9, 2015, in
McClean, Virginia, within the Eastern District of Virginia. Prior to Investor DST submitting the
additional investment for CHAHAL to trade on options and commodities, CHAHAL never
disclosed that he had used a portion of Investor DSTâs funds to pay his own personal expenses.

18. Subsequently, on or about May 24, 2017, while funds remained in Investor
MAT?âs TradeStation account, CHAHAL opened an account with Ally Bank in the name of
Investor MAT and his or her spouse. CHAHAL transferred funds totaling $48,750 from the
TradeStation account in the name of Investor MAT to the Ally Bank account.

19. Subsequently, CHAHAL then transferred money from the Ally Bank account to
the Kane Capital account and other bank accounts under the control of CHAHAL for his own

personal benefit and use on or about the following dates in the following amounts:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Date of Transfer Amount of Transfer
5/25/2017 $9,000
3/30/2017 $5,000
6/2/2017 $1,500
6/7/2017 $1,075
6/9/2017 $1,250
6/15/2017 $2,500
7/6/2017 $1,500

8/15/2017 $4,000
8/28/2017 $5,000

 

 

 

 

20. At no point did Investor MAT or his spouse authorize the transfer of funds from
their account at TradeStation to other accounts controlled by CHAHAL.

21. â_âIn total, CHAHAL was entrusted with the funds of more than 50 investors.

22. On January 4, 2018, CHAHAL was interviewed by law enforcement and prepared
a handwritten statement. In that statement, CHAHAL admitted that â[rJeporting a profit to [his]
clients were [sic] totally and incredibly wrong in every way.â He further explained that â[a]t least
early to 2016 and all of 2017, I had been lieing [sic] to investors about their returns and lieing
[sic] to new clients about my returns and their future profits. I was using new client money to
pay former clients who required a withdrawal while still reporting a profit through statements I
was creating.â

23. â This statement of facts includes those facts necessary to support the plea
agreement between CHAHAL and the United States. It does not include each and every fact
known to CHAHAL or to the United States, and it is not intended to be a full enumeration of all

of the facts surrounding the defendant's case. CHAHAL acknowledges that the foregoing
Case 1:18-cv-00422-LMB-JFA Document 24 Filed 06/20/19 Page 27 of 28 PagelD# 144

statement of facts does not describe all of CHAHALâs conduct relating to the offenses charged in
this case.
24. The actions of the defendant, as recounted above, were in all respects knowing

and deliberate, and were not committed by mistake, accident, or other innocent reason.

Respectfully submitted,
