ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTION 6(c) AND (d) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT,
MAKING FINDINGS AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

I.
INTRODUCTION

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionââ) has reason to believe
that from in or about February 9, 2012, through the present (the âRelevant Periodââ), Ikon Global
Markets, Inc. (âIkonâ or âRespondentâ violated Section 4g(a) of the Commodity Exchange Act
(the âActââ), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6g(a) (2012), and Commission Regulations (âRegulationsâ) 1.31(a)(1)
and (2) and 1.35(a), 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1.31(a)(1), (2), 1.35(a) (2017). Therefore, the Commission
deems it appropriate and in the public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and
hereby are, instituted to determine whether Respondent engaged in the violations set forth
herein and to determine whether any order should be issued imposing remedial sanctions.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Respondent has
submitted an Offer of Settlement (âOfferâ), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Without admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, Respondent consents to
the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Section 6(c) and (d) of the Commodity
Exchange Act, Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (âOrderââ) and acknowledges
service of this Order.â

 

' Respondent consents to the use of these findings and conclusions in this Order in this proceeding and

in any other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party or claimant,
and agrees that they shall be taken as true and correct and be given preclusive effect therein, without
further proof.

Respondent does not consent, however, to the use of this Order, or the findings or conclusions herein, as
the sole basis for any other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party,

FINDINGS
The Commission finds the following:
. SUMMARY

During the Relevant Period, Ikon, through its agents, officers and/or employees, entered
into and reported to NASDAQ OMX Futures Exchange, Inc. (âNFXââ) thousands of gold
Exchange for Physical (ââEFPââ) trades. Ikon failed to keep and promptly produce required
documentation for these trades, including orders, copies of confirmations, and statements of
purchase and sale in violation of Section 4g(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6g(a) (2012), and
Regulations 1.31(a)(1) and (2) and 1.35(a), 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1.31(a)(1), (2), 1.35(a) (2017).

. RESPONDENT

Ikon Global Markets, Inc. is a futures commission merchant (âFCMâ) incorporated and
with a business address in New York, New York. Ikon became registered with the Commission
and a member of the National Futures Association (âNFAâ) in March 2003. In August 2013,
NFA barred Ikon from reapplying for membership.

. FACTS

From February 9, 2012, through September 12, 2012, Ikon, for a proprietary account,
entered into thousands of EFP transactions with one of its customers, which were reported to the
NFX (âEFP Transactionsâ). These EFP Transactions involved a privately negotiated and
simultaneous exchange of a position in the XAU/USD Spot Gold Futures contract (ââNAU
contractâ)â for a corresponding and offsetting cash position in gold. As an FCM, pursuant to
Section 4g of the Act and Regulation 1.35(a), Ikon was required to keep full, complete and
systematic records relevant to its dealings in the NAU contract and any related cash positions,
including all orders, copies of confirmations, and copies of statements of purchase and sale. On
March 18, 2015, the Division of Enforcement (âDivisionâ), via a lawfully issued subpoena duces
tecum, requested that Ikon produce, for certain accounts including the Ikon proprietary account
and the relevant customer account, all documents related to transactions in the NAU contract,
including, among other things, all orders. In the subpoena, Division staff also requested all
documents reflecting any cash or other related position or the transfer of any cash or other related
position in connection with any off-exchange transactions related to the NAU contract (.e., the
EFP Transactions). On May 8, 2015, Ikon produced daily records reflecting the end of day

 

other than a: statutory disqualification proceeding; proceeding in bankruptcy, or receivership; or
proceeding to enforce the terms of this Order.

Also, Respondent does not consent to the use of the Offer or this Order, or the findings or conclusions in
this Order, by any other party in any other proceeding.

* The NAU contract was a cash-settled spot futures contract listed on the NFX; each contract was equal

to 10 Troy ounces of gold.
2
positions in NAU contracts but did not produce records relevant to the EFP Transactions or
other transactions involving the NAU contract.

On August 30, 2016, Division staff issued to Ikon a second subpoena which identified
seven specific EFP transactions and requested certain documents regarding those transactions.
On January 31, 2017, Ikon produced certain additional documents for those seven EFP
Transactions specifically identified by the Division in its second subpoena. However, its
production did not include certain documents requested by Division staff such as customer
orders, copies of confirmations, or copies of statements of purchase or sale. By letter dated
February 24, 2017, Division staff explained that, Ikon had failed to make a complete production
of all documents requested by staff. Division staff requested that all outstanding documents
requested be produced by no later than March 17, 2017. Ikon failed to produce further
documentation.

IT.
LEGAL DISCUSSION

Throughout the Relevant Period, Section 4g(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6g(a) (2012),
required, in relevant part, every FCM to keep books and records for a period of time specified
by the Commission and to make those books and records available for Commission inspection
upon request. Regulation 1.31(a)(1), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.31(a)(1) (2017), specified that such books
and records must be kept for a period of five years. Pursuant to Regulation 1.35(a), 17 C.F.R.

Â§ 1.35(a) (2017), an FCM was required to keep full, complete, and systematic records of all
transactions relating to its business of dealing in commodity futures and cash commodities,
including, among other things, all orders, copies of confirmations, and copies of statements of
purchase and sale, and to produce such records to the Commission upon request.
Notwithstanding subsequent amendments to the regulation, these requirements continue to
apply. Regulation 1.35 (a)(1)() continues to require that an FCM keep full, complete, and
systematic records of all transactions relating to its business of dealing in commodity interests
and related cash transactions, including, among other things, all orders, copies of confirmations,
and copies of statements of purchase and sale. Regulation 1.35(a)(8) continues to require that
an FCM produce such records to the Commission upon request. Ikon either did not create or did
not retain, and did not produce all documents requested by the Commission related to the EFP
Transactions during the Relevant Period. These failures violated Section 4g(a) of the Act and
Regulations 1.31(a)(1) and 1.35(a).

Additionally, during the Relevant Period, Regulation 1.31(a)(2) provided that persons
required to keep books and records by the Act or by the Regulations shall provide those records
âpromptlyâ to a Commission representative upon request. Ikon was unable to produce in a
timely manner the requested EFP documentation. This failure violated Regulation 1.31(a)(2).
IV.

FINDINGS OF VIOLATIONS

Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that, during the Relevant Period, Ikon
violated Section 4g(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6g(a) (2012), and Regulations 1.31(a)(1) and (2)
and 1.35(a), 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1.31(a)(1), (2), 1.35(a) (2017).
