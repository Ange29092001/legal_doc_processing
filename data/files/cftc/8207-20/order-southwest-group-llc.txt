ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTION 6(c) AND (d) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, MAKING
FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

I. INTRODUCTION

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ) has reason to believe that
from April 2018 through at least September 2018 (the âRelevant Periodâ), Southwest Group,
LLC (âSouthwest Groupâ or âRespondentââ) violated Section 2(c)(2)(C)Git)()(aa) of the
Commodity Exchange Act (âActâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(c)(2)(C)Git)(D)(aa) (2018), and Commission
Regulation (âRegulationâ) 5.3(a)(6)(i), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 5.3(a)(6)() (2019). Therefore, the
Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest that public administrative
proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted to determine whether Respondent engaged in the
violations set forth herein and to determine whether any order imposing remedial sanctions
should be issued.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Respondent has
submitted an Offer of Settlement (âOfferâ), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Without admitting or denying any of the findings herein, Respondent consents to the entry of this
Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Section 6(c) and (d) of the Commodity Exchange Act,
Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (âOrderâ) and acknowledges service of this
Order. '

 

' Respondent consents to the entry of this Order and to the use of the findings herein in this proceeding and in any
other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party or claimant, and agrees that
they shall be taken as true and correct and given preclusive effect therein, without further proof. Respondent does
not consent, however, to the use of this Order, or the findings herein, as the sole basis for any other proceeding
brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party or claimant, other than: a proceeding in
bankruptcy or receivership; or a proceeding to enforce the terms of this Order. Respondent does not consent to the
use of the Offer or this Order, or the findings herein, by any other party in any other proceeding.
Il. FINDINGS
The Commission finds the following:
A. SUMMARY

During the Relevant Period, Southwest Group acted as a retail foreign exchange dealer
(âRFEDâ) without being registered with the Commission as such, by being, or offering to be, the
counterparty to financed retail foreign currency (âforexâ) transactions for U.S. retail forex
customers who were not eligible contract participants (âECPsââ) as defined in Section 1a(18) of
the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1a(18) (2018). By acting as an RFED without being registered in that
capacity, Southwest Group violated Section 2(c)(2)(C)(1i)(1)(aa) of the Act and Regulation

5.3(a)(6)(i).
B. | RESPONDENT

Southwest Group, LLC is a Florida limited liability company, formed in February 2018,
that is currently active. Southwest Group maintains its principal office in Fort Myers, Florida.
Southwest Group has never been registered with the Commission in any capacity.

C. FACTS

During the Relevant Period, Southwest Group, through its website
www.currencyliquidator.com, offered transactions in off-exchange forex on a financed basis to
retail customers located throughout the United States and who were not ECPs. These financed
retail forex transactions did not result in actual delivery of forex within two days of the
transactions.

Southwest Group offered to enter into, and entered into, transactions in forex with retail
customers who were not ECPs by offering to act as the counterparty to transactions in
Vietnamese Dong and/or Iraqi Dinar. Southwest Group, through its website, offered customers
transactions in forex utilizing a âPremium+ Layaway Programâ financing option. The
âPremium+ Layaway Programâ was financed by Southwest Group, acting as the counterparty to
these retail forex transactions, which did not result in actual delivery of forex within two days of
the transactions. Instead, retail customers received their forex either 30 or 45 days following the
date of their forex transactions.

At no time during the Relevant Period was Southwest Group registered as an RFED or
eligible for an exemption from the requirement to register as an RFED.

Iii. LEGAL DISCUSSION

Regulation 5.1(h)(1), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 5.1(h)(1) (2019), defines an RFED as âany person that
is, or that offers to be, the counterparty to a retail forex transaction,â subject to exceptions not
relevant here. Pursuant to Section 1a(38) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1a(38) (2018), âthe term
âpersonâ imports the plural or singular, and includes individuals, associates, partnerships,
corporations, and trusts.â Regulation 5.1(k) defines a âretail forex customerâ as a person, other
than an ECP, as defined in Section 1a(18) of the Act, acting on its own behalf and trading in any
account, agreement, contract, or transaction described in Section 2(c)(2)(C) of the Act.

During the Relevant Period, Southwest Group acted as an RFED by being, or offering to
be, the counterparty to financed retail forex transactions for retail forex customers. By failing to
register as an RFED, Southwest Group violated Section 2(c)(2)(C)(@ii)()(aa) of Act and
Regulation 5.3(a)(6)(i).

IV. FINDINGS OF VIOLATIONS

Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that, during the Relevant Period,
Southwest Group violated Section 2(c)(2)(C)(ii)(1)(aa) of the Act, 7
U.S.C. Â§ 2(c)(2)(C)Gi1)(D(aa) (2018), and Regulation 5.3(a)(6)(1), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 5.3(a)(6)@)
(2019).
