U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1 et seg. (2012), and the Regulations promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1.1 ef seg.

Defendants on May 23, 2014.

in the manner required by Paragraph 56 of Part VI of this Consent Order, of any bankruptcy
proceeding filed by, on behalf of, or against them, whether inside or outside the United States;

Defendants in any other proceeding; and

HI. FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS
The Court, being fully advised in the premises, finds that there 1s good cause for the entry

of this Consent Order and that there is no just reason for delay. The Court therefore directs the

 
entry of the following Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, permanent injunction, and equitable
relief pursuant to 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2012), as set forth herein.
THE PARTIES AGREE AND THE COURT HEREBY FINDS:

A. Findings of Fact
1. The Parties to This Consent Order

14. â- Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an independent federal
regulatory agency that is charged by Congress with administering and enforcing the Act,

7 US.C. Â§Â§ 1 et seg. (2012), and the Regulations promulgated thereunder, 17 C-F.R. Â§Â§ 1.1 â-
190.10 (2014).

15. Defendant Cindy Vandivier is an individual whose last known residence was
Coconut Creek, Florida. Cindy Vandivier is the wife of Defendant Paul Vandivier. Cindy
Vandivier was, throughout the relevant period here, President and Secretary of Mintline. Cindy
Vandivier has never been registered with the CFTC in any capacity.

16. Defendant Paul Vandivier is an individual whose last known residence was
Coconut Creek, Florida. Paul Vandivier is the husband of Defendant Cindy Vandivier.
Between October 1994 and July 1997, Paul Vandivier had a Pending Associated Person status at
three separate registered Introducing Brokers. In each instance, the Pending status was either
withdrawn or rescinded. Paul Vandivier has no current registration status with the CFTC.

2. Settling Defendants Solicited Retail Customers to Engage in Financed Metals -
Transactions

17. | Cindy Vandivier incorporated Alliance in Florida on or about January 24, 2008.
Alliance operated as a precious metals dealer from that time until approximately May 22, 2012,

when Cindy Vandivier filed with Florida an amendment to Allianceâs Articles of Incorporation

 
changing Allianceâs name to Mintline. All references in these Findings of Fact and Conclusions
of Law to Mintline include its activities under the name Alliance during the relevant period here.

18. From at least July 16, 2011, and continuing through at least April 2013 (the
ârelevant periodâ), Cindy Vandivier and Paul Vandivier, by and through Mintline, solicited
members of the general public through various means, including but not limited to, an mternet |
website, promotional material, and telephone calls, to purchase physical metals, including gold,
silver, platinum, and palladium, on a leveraged, margined, or financed basis (âfinanced metals
transactionsâ). Although Mintline also offered metals on a fully-paid basis, the vast majority of
its business was in financed metals transactions.

19. â In solicitations to customers, Cindy and Paul Vandivier, by and through Mintline,
offered customers the opportunity to purchase metals by depositing a percentage of the metalsâ
purchase price and financing the remainder. Mintlineâs solicitation materials offered to finance
approximately seventy-five per cent of the customerâs purchase. Cindy and Paul Vandivier, by
and through Mintline, charged customers an account fee, commissions and/or fees on
transactions, and financing charges for the amount financed.

20. Cindy and Paul Vandivier, by and through Mintline, offered to store the
purportedly purchased metals on behalf of its customers who engaged in financed metals
transactions and to deliver those metals to the customer upon payment in full. With the
exception of a few instances which are not the subject of this action, Mintlineâs customers did
not take delivery of their metals. Rather, the vast majority of Mintlineâs customers were only
speculating on price movements of their metals.

21. At least some, if not all, of Mintlineâs financed metals transaction customers were

not âeligible contract participantsâ as defined by 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1a(18)(xi) (2012).

 
22. None of the financed metals transactions which Settling Defendants solicited
and/or accepted orders for during the relevant period was conducted on or subject to the rules of
a board of trade which had been designated or registered by the CFTC.

3. Settling Defendantsâ Misrepresentations and Omissions in Connections with
Financed Metals Transactions and Misappropriation of Customersâ Funds

23. Contrary to what their customers were led to believe, Cindy Vandivier and Paul
Vandivier, by and through Mintline, did not purchase metals on behalf of its financed metals
transaction customers; nor did they arrange for or extend, either directly or indirectly, financing
for the purchase of metals on behalf of these customers. Nevertheless, Mintline charged
customers interest on the financed amount and deducted the interest from customersâ accounts.

24, During the Relevant Period, Mintline accepted approximately $1,569,487 from
customers in connection with both fully-paid and financed metals transactions. Of this amount,
approximately $1,152, 094 was accepted from customers in connection with financed metals
transactions. Of the total of approximately $1,569,487 accepted by Mintline during the Relevant
Period, only approximately $158,465 was disbursed by Mintline to a company known to engage
in the sale of physical metals.

25. Instead of purchasing metals for Mintlineâs financed metals transaction
customers, Cindy Vandivier and Paul Vandivier misappropriated most, if not all, of the financed
metals transaction customersâ funds.

26. Upon opening an account with Mintline, customers would either wire their funds
. directly to a bank account in the name of Mintline (or, prior to approximately May 2012, in the
name of Alliance) or provide a check made out to Mintline (or prior to âapproximately May 2012,

made out to Alliance) which was then deposited into Mintlineâs (or, prior to approximately May

 
2012, Allianceâs) bank account. These bank accounts were opened by Cindy Vandivier and Paul
Vandivier and each of them had signatory authority for these accounts.

27. When Mintline received funds from its financed metals transaction customers it
did not purchase physical metals on behalf of those customers. Instead, Mintline would simply
record the customerâs transaction and track the value of the transactions in each customerâs
account.

28. In fact, once customer funds were deposited into the Mintline bank account (or,
prior to approximately May 2012, the Alliance bank account) they were then transferred to a
second bank account in the name of Mintline (or, prior to approximately May 2012, in the name
of Alliance). These bank accounts were also opened by Cindy Vandivier and Paul Vandivier and
each of them had signatory authority for these accounts. Once the funds were transferred to the
second account, they were then used (with the exception of $158,465 paid to a company known
to engage in the sale of physical metals) to pay Mintlineâs operating expenses and to pay for
personal expenses of Cindy Vandivier and Paul Vandivier, including, among other things,
animal, automobile, communication, employee, medical, and shopping expenses. Checks for
these payments were signed by both Cindy Vandivier and Paul Vandivier.

29. At no time during the relevant period did Cindy Vandivier and Paul Vandivier
disclose to Mintlineâs financed metals transaction customers that Mintline was in fact neither
financing, purchasing, nor storing actual metals on their behalf, or that Cindy Vandivier and Paul
Vandivier were in fact misappropriating their funds to pay Mintlineâs operating expenses and the
personal expenses of Cindy Vandivier and Paul Vandivier.

30. Sometime between January and April 2013, Mintline ceased its operations. Of

the approximately $1,152,094 million Mintline accepted from customers in connection with

 
financed metals transactions during the relevant period, Mintline returned approximately
$115,719 in cash to these customers prior to ceasing its operations. In addition to the cash
returned, Mintline provided certain financed metals transaction customers with bullion bars
worth approximately $49,612. Mintlineâs financed metals transaction customers have suffered
approximately $986,763 in losses.
4, Cindy Vandivier and Paul Vandivier Were Controlling Persons of Mintline
31. During the relevant period, Cindy Vandivier and Paul Vandivier were controlling
persons of Mintline. Cindy Vandivier was an officer of Mintline. Both Cindy Vandivier and
Paul Vandivier opened bank accounts on Mintlineâs behalf and were signatories on Mintlineâs
bank accounts. Both Cindy Vandivier and Paul Vandivier oversaw the activities of Mintlineâs
employees and/or had the authority to hire and fire employees.
B. Conclusions of Law

1. Jurisdiction and Venue

32. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2012),
which provides that whenever it shall appear to the CFTC that any person has engaged, is
engaging, or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a violation of any provision of
the Act or any rule, regulation, or order promulgated thereunder, the CFTC may bring an action
in the proper district court of the United States against such person to enjoin such act or practice,
or to enforce compliance with the Act, or any rule, regulation or order thereunder.

33. | Venue properly lies with this Court pursuant to 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(e) (2012),
because the Defendants reside in this jurisdiction and the acts and practices in violation of the

Act occurred within this District.

 
2. Violation of 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6b(a)(2)(A) and (C) (2012): Fraud in Connection
with Financed Metals Transactions

34. By the conduct described in paragraphs 1 through 32 above, Settling Defendants
cheated and defrauded, or attempted to cheat and defraud, and willfully deceived, or attempted to
deceive, their customers in or in connection with financed metals transactions by, among other
things, knowingly or recklessly: 1) misappropriating customer funds intended for the purchase of
physical metals and using those funds to pay Mintline's operating expenses and to pay for
personal expenses of Cindy Vandivier and Paul Vandivier; 2) misrepresenting to customers that
Mintline purchased and stored physical metals and provided financing to customers for the
purchase of physical metals; and 3) failing to disclose that customer funds, rather than being used
to purchase metals, were in fact being misappropriated to pay Mintlineâs operating expenses and |
to pay for personal expenses of Cindy Vandivier and Paul Vandivier, in violation of 7 U.S.C.

Â§Â§ 6b(a)(2)(A) and (C) (2012).

3. Violation of 7 U.S.C. Â§ 9(1) (2012), and 17 C.F.R. Â§ 180.1(a) (2014):
Employment of Manipulative and Deceptive Devices

35. By the conduct described in paragraphs 1 through 32 above, Settling Defendants
intentionally or recklessly used or employed, or attempted to use or employ, a manipulative
device, scheme, or artifice to defraud, or made or attempted to make, untrue statements or
misleading statements of material fact, or omitted to state material facts necessary in order to
make statements made not untrue or misleading, or engaged or attempted to engage in acts,
practices, or courses of business which operated a fraud or deceit upon other persons by:

1) misappropriating customer funds intended for the purchase of physical metals and using those
funds to pay Mintline's operating expenses and to pay for personal expenses of Cindy Vandivier

and Paul Vandivier; 2) misrepresenting to customers that Mintline purchased and stored physical

10

 
metals and provided financing to customers for the purchase of physical metals; and 3) failing to
disclose that customer funds, rather than being used to purchase metals, were in fact being
misappropriated to pay Mintline's operating expenses and to pay for personal expenses of Cindy
Vandivier and Paul Vandivier, in violation of 7 U.S.C. Â§ 9(1) (2012), and 17 C.F.R. Â§ 180.1(a)
(2014).

4, Violation of 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6(a) (2012): Elegal Off-Exchange Trading

36. By the conduct described in paragraphs 1 through 32 above, Settling Defendants
offered to enter into, entered into, executed, confirmed the execution of, or conducted an office
or business in the United States for the purpose of soliciting or accepting orders for, or otherwise
dealing in, transactions in, or in connection with, a contract for the purchase or sale of a
commodity for future delivery that were not conducted on or subject to the rules of a board of
trade which had been designated or registered by the CFTC as a contract market for such
commodity in violation of 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6(a) (2012).

37. Unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, there is a reasonable likelihood that
the Settling Defendants will continue to engage in the acts and practices alleged in the Complaint

and in similar acts and practices in violation of the Act and Regulations.

IV. PERMANENT INJUNCTION
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT:
38. Based upon and in connection with the foregoing conduct, pursuant to 7 U.S.C.

connection with any order to make, or the making of, any contract of sale of any

1]

 
commodity for future delivery, including, without limitation, financed precious metals,
that is made, or to be made, for or on behalf of, or with, any other person, or willfully
deceiving or attempting to deceive the other person by any means whatsoever in regard to
any order or contract or the disposition or execution of any order or contract, or in regard
to any act of agency performed with respect to any order or contract, in violation of 7
U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6b(a)(2)(A) and (C) (2012);

b. In connection with any contract of sale of any commodity in interstate commerce,
including, without limitation, financed precious metals, using or employing, or

untrue or misleading, or engaging or attempting to engage in acts, practices or courses of
business which operate or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person in violation
of 7 U.S.C. Â§9(1) (2012), and 17 C.F.R. Â§ 180.1(a)(1)-(3) (2014);

c. Offering to enter into, entering into, executing, confirming the execution of, or
conducting any office or business in the United States, it territories or possessions,

commodity for future delivery, including, without limitation, financed precious metals, in
violation of 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6(a) (2012).

42. Settling Defendants are also permanently restrained, enjoined and prohibited from

in 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1a(40) (2012));

b. Entering into any transactions involving âcommodity interestsâ (as that term is

which they have a direct or indirect interest;

C. Having any commodity interests traded on their behalf;

d. Controlling or directing the trading for or on behalf of any other person or entity,

Â§ 1a(38) (2012)), registered, exempted from registration or required to be registered with

the Commission except as provided for in 17 C.F.R. Â§ 4.14(a)(9) 2014).

Vv. RESTITUTION AND CIVIL MONETARY PENALTIES

A. Restitution

43, Settling Defendants shall pay, jointly and severally, restitution in the amount of

nine hundred eighty-six thousand, seven hundred sixty-three dollars ($986,763) (âRestitution

13

 
Obligationâ), plus post-judgment interest. Post-judgment interest shall accrue on the Restitution
Obligation beginning on the date of entry of this Consent Order and shall be determined by using
the Treasury Bill rate prevailing on the date of entry of this Consent Order pursuant to 28 U.S.C.
Â§ 1961 (2012).

44. To effect payment of the Restitution Obligation and the distribution of any
restitution payments to Settling Defendantsâ customers, the Court appoints the National Futures
Association (âNFAâ) as Monitor (âMonitorâ). The Monitor shall collect restitution payments
from Settling Defendants and make distributions as set forth below. Because the Monitor is
acting as an officer of this Court in performing these services, the NFA shall not be liable for any
action or inaction arising from NFAâs appointment as Monitor, other than actions involving
fraud.

45. Settling Defendants shall make Restitution Obligation payments under this
Consent Order to the Monitor in the name âCindy Vandivier & Paul Vandivier
Settlement/Restitution Fundâ and shall send such Restitution Obligation payments by electronic
funds transfer, or by U.S. postal money order, certified check, bank cashierâs, or bank money
order, to the Office of Administration, National Futures Association, 300 South Riverside Plaza,
Suite 1800, Chicago, Illinois 60606, under cover letter that identifies the paying Defendant and
the name and docket number of this proceeding. Settling Defendants shall simultaneously
transmit copies of the cover letter and the form of payment to the Chief Financial Officer,
Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street, NW,
Washington, D.C. 20581.

46. | The Monitor shall oversee the Restitution Obligation and shall have the discretion

to determine the manner of distribution of such funds in an equitable fashion to Settling

14

 
Defendantsâ customers identified by the CFTC or may defer distribution until such time as the
Monitor deems appropriate. In the event that the amount of Restitution Obligation payments to
the Monitor are of a de minimis nature such that the Monitor determines that the administrative
cost of making a distribution to eligible customers is impractical, the Monitor may, in its
discretion, treat such restitution payments as civil monetary penalty payments, which the
Monitor shall forward to the CFTC following the instructions for civil monetary penalty
payments set forth in Paragraph 55 below.

47. Settling Defendants shall cooperate with the Monitor as appropriate to provide
such information as the Monitor deems necessary and appropriate to identify Settling
Defendantâs customers to whom the Monitor, in its sole discretion, may determine to include in
any plan for distribution of any Restitution Obligation payments. Settling Defendants shall
execute any documents necessary to release funds that they have in any repository, bank,
investment, or other financial institution, wherever located, in order to make partial or total
payment toward the Restitution Obligation.

48. Upon entry of this Consent Order, the statutory restraining order entered on May
13, 2014 shall terminate. Within ten (10) days of the entry of this Consent Order, any repository,
bank, investment, or other financial institution, wherever located, holding any of Settling
Defendantsâ assets frozen pursuant to the statutory restraining order shall be authorized and
directed to release such assets to the Monitor in the name of the âCindy Vandivier and Paul
Vandivier Settlement/Restitution Fundâ per the instructions described above in paragraph 43,
including, but not limited to approximately fifty-six thousand seven hundred sixty-five dollars

($56,765) in frozen assets held at Wells Fargo Bank.

15

 
49. The Monitor shall provide the CFTC at the beginning of each calendar year with a
report detailing the disbursement of funds to Settling Defendantsâ customers during the previous
year. The Monitor shail transmit this report under a cover letter that identifies the name and
docket number of this proceeding to the Chief Financial Officer, Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20581.

50. The amounts payable to each customer shall not limit the ability of any customer
from proving that a greater amount is owed from Settling Defendants or any other person or
entity, and nothing herein shall be construed in any way to limit or abridge the rights of any
customer that exist under state or common law.

51. Pursuant to Rule 71 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, each customer of
Settling Defendants who suffered a loss is explicitly made an intended third-party beneficiary of
this Consent Order and may seek to enforce obedience of this Consent Order to obtain
satisfaction of any portion of the restitution that has not been paid by Settling Defendants to
ensure continued compliance with any provision of this Consent Order and to hold Settling
Defendants in contempt for any violations of any provision of this Consent Order.

52. To the extent that any funds accrue to the U.S. Treasury for satisfaction of
Settling Defendantsâ Restitution Obligation, such funds shall be transferred to the Monitor for
disbursement in accordance with the procedures set forth above.

B. Civil Monetary Penalty

53. Defendant Cindy Vandivier shall pay a civil monetary penalty in the amount of

one million dollars ($1,000,000) (âCMP Obligationâ), plus post-judgment interest. Post-

judgment interest shall accrue on the CMP Obligation beginning on the date of entry of this

16

 
Consent Order and shall be determined by using the Treasury Bill rate prevailing on the date of
entry of this Consent Order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1961 (2012).

54. Defendant Paul Vandivier shall pay a civil monetary penalty in the amount of one
million dollars ($1,000,000) (âCMP Obligationâ), plus post-judgment interest. Post-judgment
interest shall accrue on the CMP Obligation beginning on the date of entry of this Consent Order
and shall be determined by using the Treasury Bill rate prevailing on the date of entry of this
Consent Order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1961 (2012).

55. Settling Defendants shall pay their CMP Obligations by electronic funds transfer,
U.S. postal money order, certified check, bank cashierâs check, or bank money order. If payment
