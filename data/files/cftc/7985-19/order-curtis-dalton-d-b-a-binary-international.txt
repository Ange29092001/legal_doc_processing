ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTIONS 6(c) AND 6(d) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, MAKING
FINDINGS AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

I.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ) has reason to believe that
from in or about October 2013 to in or about May 2016 (the âRelevant Periodââ), Curtis Dalton,
doing business as Binary International (ââDaltonâ or âRespondentâ), violated Sections
2(c)(2)(B)(iv)(1)(aa), 2(e), 4c(b), and 4d(a)(1) of the Commodity Exchange Act (âActâ),

7 ULS.C. Â§Â§ 2(c)(2)(B)(iv)()(aa), 2(e), 6c(b), 6d(a)(1) (2012), and Commission Regulations
5.3(a)(4)G)(B), 32.2, and 33.3, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 5.3(a)(4)G)(B), 32.2, 33.3 (2018). Therefore, the
Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest that public administrative
proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted to determine whether Respondent engaged in the
violations set forth herein and to determine whether any order should be issued imposing
remedial sanctions.

IL.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Respondent has
submitted an Offer of Settlement (âOfferâ), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Without admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, Respondent consents to
the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 6(c) and 6(d) of the
Commodity Exchange Act, Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (âOrderâ) and
acknowledge service of this Order.â

 

' Respondent consents to the entry of this Order and to the use of these findings in this
proceeding and in any other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission
is a party; provided, however, that Respondent does not consent to the use of the Offer, or the
TIL.
The Commission finds the following:
A. SUMMARY

During the Relevant Period, Dalton violated Sections 2(c)(2)(B)(iv)(I)(aa), 2(e), 4c(b),
and 4d(a)(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 2(c)(2)(B)(iv)(D(aa), 2(e), 6c(b), 6d(a)(1) (2012), and
Regulations 5.3(a)(4)(i)(B), 32.2, and 33.3, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 5.3(a)(4)G)(B), 32.2, 33.3 (2018), by
offering to enter into, entering into, and confirming the execution of illegal off-exchange retail
commodity transactionsâspecifically, binary optionsâfor U.S. and overseas customers while
failing to be registered as required. During the Relevant Period, Daltonâs business took in at
least $1.5 million from Binary International customers for the purpose of trading binary options.

B. RESPONDENT

Curtis Dalton is a resident of Middleton, Massachusetts. Dalton was previously
registered with the Commission as an Associated Person of Morgan Stanley & Company LLC
from July 2008 to June 2009, and as an Associated Person of Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC
from June 2009 to October 2009. Dalton is not currently registered with the Commission in any
capacity.

C. FACTS

During the Relevant Period, Dalton, doing business as Binary International, solicited,
accepted, and executed orders for binary options trading involving foreign currencies for both
U.S. and overseas individuals. Dalton did business pursuant to an agreement with a British
Virgin Islands company located in Cyprus. This BVI company operated a web-based and mobile
application binary options trading platform, management and monitoring systems, and various
other features to facilitate the operation of a binary options trading website. Under the
agreement with the BVI company, Dalton obtained a non-exclusive license to use and operate
the BVI companyâs products and services under the name Binary International. In exchange,
Dalton paid the BVI company twenty percent (20%) of Binary Internationalâs revenues.

Dalton solicited customers through the Binary International website
(www.binaryinternational.com), email, and by telephone. Customers opened their accounts by
completing an online application on Binary Internationalâs website and transferring money by
credit card or wire transfer to a bank account in Curacao controlled by Dalton. Once customers
opened and funded their accounts, they could begin to make trades. Most, if not all, of Binary
Internationalâs customers were not eligible contract participants (âECPâ) as defined by Section
1a(18) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1a(18) (2012). Nor was Dalton himself an ECP. |

 

findings or conclusions in this Order consented to in the Offer, as the sole basis for any other
proceeding brought by the Commission, other than in a proceeding in bankruptcy or to enforce
the terms of this Order. Nor does Respondent consent to the use of the Offer or this Order, or the
findings or conclusions in this Order consented to in the Offer, by any other party in any other
proceeding.
Customers who made trades through Binary International bought or sold âcallâ or âputâ
options that allowed them to make predictive trades on whether the price of a certain foreign
currency would go âupâ or âdownâ at a future date and/or time. Customers could set expiry
times on their options such as thirty (30) seconds, sixty (60) seconds, five minutes, or fifteen
minutes. At the expiry of the option, if the customer had correctly predicted the price movement
of the foreign currency the customer would receive a credit to his or her account; if the customer
had incorrectly predicted the price movement of the foreign currency, he or she would lose the
full amount paid for the option. During the Relevant Period, Daltonâs business took in at least
$1.5 million from Binary International customers for the purpose of trading binary options.

In an agreement dated June 1, 2016, Dalton sold the business and assets of Binary
International to a limited liability company formed in Mauritius in April 2016.

IV.
LEGAL DISCUSSION

A. Dalton, Doing Business as Binary International, Offered Unlawful Off-Exchange
Options Trading in Violation of Section 4c(b) of the Act, and Regulations 32.2 and
33.3

Section 4c(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6c(b) (2012), makes it unlawful to offer to enter into,
enter into or confirm the execution of, any transaction involving any commodity regulated under
the Act which is of the character of, or is commonly known to the trade as, an âoption,â
âprivilege,â âindemnity,â âbid,â âoffer,â âput,â âcall,â âadvance guaranty,â or âdecline
guaranty,â contrary to any rule, regulation, or order of the Commission prohibiting any such
transaction or allowing any such transaction under such terms and conditions as the Commission

shall prescribe.

39 6Â¢

Regulation 32.2, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 32.2 (2018), in relevant part, makes it unlawful for any
person to offer to enter into, enter into, confirm the execution of, maintain a position in, or
otherwise conduct activity related to any transaction in interstate commerce that is a commodity
option transaction, unless such transaction is conducted in compliance with and subject to the
provisions of the Act, including any Commission rule, regulation, or order thereunder, otherwise
applicable to any other swap.

Regulation 33.3, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 33.3 (2018), in relevant part, makes it unlawful for any
person to offer to enter into, enter into, confirm the execution of, or maintain a position in, any
commodity option transaction unless the option involved is traded on or subject to the rules of a
designated contract market.

Dalton offered to enter into and entered into binary option transactions with U.S.
customers, and confirmed the execution of those binary options. These transactions were not
conducted on a designated contract market, an exempt board of trade, or a bona fide foreign
board of trade.* Therefore, Dalton violated Section 4c(b) of the Act and Regulations 32.2 and
33.3.

B. Dalton, Doing Business as Binary International, Engaged in Unlawful Off-Exchange
Swaps Trading in Violation of Section 2(e) of the Act

Under Section 1a(47)(A)(i) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1a(47)() (2012), options, unless
excluded by Section 1a(47)(B) of the Act, are also considered to be swaps. None of the
exclusions in Section 1a(47)(B) of the Act apply here. Section 2(e) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(e)
(2012), makes it unlawful for any person, other than an ECP, to enter into a swap unless the
swap is entered into on, or subject to the rules of, a board of trade designated as a contract
market.

Dalton entered into swaps in the form of binary option transactions with U.S. customers.
Neither Dalton nor his customers were ECPs. The transactions by Binary International
customers were not entered into on or subject to the rules of a board of trade designated as a
contract market. Therefore, Dalton violated Section 2(e) of the Act.

Cc, Dalton, Doing Business as Binary International, Operated as an Unregistered
Futures Commission Merchant in Violation of Sections 2(c)(2)(B) and 4d(a)(1) of the
Act, and Regulation 5.3

Section 1a(28) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1a(28) (2012), in relevant part, defines a futures
commission merchant (âFCMâ) as any individual, association, partnership, corporation or trust
that engages in soliciting or in accepting orders for swaps and commodity options, and accepts
money, securities, or property (or extends credit in lieu thereof) to margin, guarantee, or secure
any trades or contracts that result or may result therefrom.

Section 2(c)(2)(B)(Qv)(D(aa) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(c)(2)(B)(iv)()(aa) (2012), in
pertinent part, makes it unlawful for any entity to solicit or accept orders from non-ECPs in
connection with agreements, contracts, or transactions involving foreign currency options unless
such entity is registered as an FCM. Section 4d(a)(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6d(a)(1) (2012), in
pertinent part, makes it unlawful for any person to operate as an FCM unless such person is
registered with the Commission as an FCM and such registration shall not have expired nor have
been suspended nor revoked. Regulation 5.3(a)(4)(G)(B), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 5.3(a)(4)@)(B) (2018),
requires that all FCMs that solicit or accept orders from any non-ECPs in connection with any
retail forex transaction must be registered.

Dalton, while not registered as an FCM, solicited and accepted orders for binary options
on foreign currencies from U.S. non-ECP customers for the purpose of margining, guaranteeing,
or securing binary options trades or contracts resulting from such orders. Therefore, Dalton
violated Sections 2(c)(2)(B)(iv)(D(aa) and 4d(a)(1) of the Act and Regulation 5.3(a)(4)(@)(B).

 

* Regulation 32.3, which exempts trade options from the requirements of Section 4c(b), is
inapplicable to this matter.
V.

Regulations 5.3(a)(4)(i)(B), 32.2, and 33.3, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 5.3(a)(4)(i)(B), 32.2, 33.3 (2018).
