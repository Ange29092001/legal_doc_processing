Case 5:17-cv-00743 Document1 Filed 04/19/17 Page 2o0f37 Page ID #:2

Plaintiff, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ),
alleges as follows:

I. SUMMARY

1. From at least May 2012, through May 2015 (the âRelevant Periodâ),
Robert Leland Johnson IV (âJohnsonâ) and Marisa E. Johnson (âMarisa Johnsonâ),
individually and as principals and agents of Capitol Equity FX LLC (âCapitol
Equityâ), (collectively, ââDefendantsâ), without being registered with the
Commission, fraudulently solicited, and misappropriated, at least $1,735,750 in total
funds from at least 10 individuals and entities (âpool participantsâ) to participate in a
purported hedge fund that operated as a pooled investment vehicle trading
commodity futures and off-exchange leveraged or margined foreign currency
exchange (âforexââ) contracts, in violation of the Commodity Exchange Act (âActâ)
and its implementing regulations (âRegulationsâ).

2. To perpetuate and conceal their fraud, Defendants made material
misrepresentations and omissions to pool participants and fabricated sham documents
that falsely reflected significant trading returns and soaring account balances. In
reality, Defendants did not trade commodity futures or forex for the benefit of pool
participants, participants did not have their own accounts, no profits were generated,
and Defendants misappropriated participantsâ funds for their own use.

3. Accordingly, pursuant to 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 2(c)(2)(C) and 13a-1 (2012), the
Commission brings this action to enjoin Defendantsâ unlawful acts and practices, to

compel their compliance with the Act and the Regulations, and to enjoin them from
engaging in any commodity-interest related activity, as set forth below. In addition,
the Commission seeks civil monetary penalties for each violation of the Act and
Regulations, and remedial ancillary relief, including, but not limited to, trading and
registration bans, restitution, disgorgement, rescission, an accounting, pre- and post-
judgment interest, and such other relief as the Court deems necessary and appropriate.

4. Unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, there is a reasonable
likelihood that Defendants will continue to engage in the acts and practices alleged in
this Complaint, and similar acts and practices, as more fully described below.

II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

5. This Court possesses jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 7 U.S.C. Â§
13a-1 (2012), which authorizes the Commission to seek injunctive and other relief
against any person whenever it appears to the Commission that such person has
engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a
violation of any provision of the Act or any rule, regulation, or order thereunder, and
7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(c)(2)(C) (2012), which provides the Commission with jurisdiction over
the forex solicitations and transactions at issue in this action.

6. Venue properly lies with this Court pursuant to 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(e)
(2012), because Defendants reside in this District, Defendants transact or transacted
business in this District, and certain transactions, acts, practices, and courses of|

that Defendants submitted to OANDA Corporation (ââOANDAâ) for the purpose of
opening a non-pooled forex trading account in the name of Capitol Equity FX. As set
forth below, Marisa Johnson opened additional forex trading accounts used in
Defendantsâ fraudulent scheme and, with Johnson, controlled bank accounts into}.

knowingly and falsely represented to actual and prospective pool participants that all
funds were pooled and used to trade commodity futures and forex on behalf of the

was profitable; and that pool participantsâ Capitol Equity participation or partnership

units were earning significant gains. All of these representations were false.

Case 5:17-cv-00743 Documenti1 Filed 04/19/17 Page 7 of37 Page ID #:7

12. To execute the fraudulent scheme, Johnson, as an agent or employee of
Capitol Equity, solicited friends and acquaintances residing in California, in person,
by word-of-mouth, by email, by the Internet, and by use of the mails and/or other
means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce, to transfer funds into bank |
accounts in the name of, and under the control of, the Defendants. In these bank
accounts, Defendants commingled their own personal funds with the funds of pool
participants.

13. Between May 2012 and December 2013, before the formation of Capitol
Equity, Johnson and Maria Johnson solicited and received funds from at least three
pool participants. After forming Capitol Equity on April 14, 2014, Defendants began
doing business as Capitol Equity and continued to fraudulently solicit and pool funds
for trading commodity futures and leveraged or margined forex contracts.

14. In April 2014, Defendants registered the domain name
capitolequityfx.com and created a public website at that domain (the âCapitol Equity
Websiteâ). Defendants used the Capitol Equity Website to advertise Capitol Equity
as an investment management company offering a âprogramâ that drew on 18 years
of experience to provide a âsystematic approach trading a diversified portfolio of
futures and forex markets.â According to the Capitol Equity Website, Defendantsâ
âmodel measures the expansion and contraction of daily volatility for multiple
commodities .. . with the objective to limit losses on a per trade basis while allowing

the system to profit from short-term price movements.â

15. After forming Capitol Equity, Defendants required some pool
participants to sign a âSubscription Agreement,â which provided that pool
participants acquired âlimited partnership interestsâ in Capitol Equity in exchange for
having âtransferred cash by wire or by checkâ or having provided âmarketable
securitiesâ to Capitol Equity. Johnson executed the Subscription Agreements on
behalf of Capitol Equity.

16. Defendants also required some or all new pool participants to enter into
an âInvestment Management Agreement,â which provided that Capitol Equity would
be retained by the pool participant âto manage all of [the pool participantâs] assets on

99

a discretionary basis... .â Section 5 of the Investment Management Agreement
provided that Capitol Equity, the âInvestment Manager,â âshall have full power to
invest and reinvest the [pool participantâs assets] in such securities and other
investments as the Investment Manager in its discretion shall consider to be in the
best interest of the [pool participant].â Johnson executed the Investment
Management Agreements as the âPresidentâ of Capitol Equity, and identified himself} _
as the âInvestment Managerâ of Capitol Equity in Schedule B to the Investment
Management Agreements.

leveraged or margined forex contracts, without being registered with the Commission
as a CPO. At no time did Defendants operate the pool as an entity cognizable as a
legal entity separate from that of the pool operator, nor did the Defendants ever open
a pooled trading account for the benefit of participants.

of a CPO by soliciting funds, securities, or property for participation in the

Brokers and OANDA trading accounts sustained net realized losses of approximately

$728,000.
D. Structure of the Pool and Commingling

funds with the funds of Johnson and Marisa Johnson. On numerous occasions,

inquiring whether K.P.âs Capitol Equity returns would âremain at 25% annuallyâ and
whether K.P. âcan put more in as well?â Johnson responded, âYour return will go
higher than 25% and yes you can and should put more in if possible. I am getting a
50-50 split thatâs the only way to do the fund. So your returns can go and will go

40. To perpetuate their fraudulent scheme and to solicit additional pool
participants, Defendants also provided pool participants and prospective pool
participants with false reports and records in the form of fake pool performance
statements, fake OANDA fxTrade account statements, and fake individual account
statements. These documents falsely represented that Defendants engaged in
profitable forex trading with pool participantsâ funds and that pool participantsâ
Capitol Equity accounts were growing as a result of Defendantsâ forex trading.

41. Defendants knowingly provided pool participants with .fake pool
performance statements for the purpose of luring victims to the Capitol Equity pool.
For example, Defendants provided pool participants and prospective pool participants
with pool performance statements falsely reflecting that Capitol Equity had generated
enormous trading profits in calendar year 2013, based on the following fabricated
monthly returns:

a. 7.65% in January;
b. 32.14% in February;
C. 7.91% in March;
d. 6.38% in April;
e. 12.16% May;
f. 35.48% in June;
g. 9.64% in July;
h. 5.51% in August;

1. 16.89% in September;

j. 18.79% October;

k. 14.37% in November; and
I. 10.76% in December.

42. Defendants provided pool participants with similar fabricated pool
performance statements for the years 2014 and 2015.

43. Defendants also provided fake OANDA fxTrade account statements to
pool participants that mirrored the form of actual OANDA fxTrade account
statements and were designed to mislead pool participants. The fake OANDA
fxTrade account statements falsely inflated the balances held in Capitol Equityâs
trading accounts. These fabricated statements were made to appear as if they had
been issued by OANDA for Capitol Equityâs account *282, and falsely represented
that the account held far more funds than it did in reality. In fact, the fake statements
overstated balances by millions of dollars.

44. For example, Johnson used email to provide pool participants with a
purported OANDA fxTrade account statement for December 2014 which falsely
reflected a Closing Balance and Closing NAV (net asset value) of $1,942,398.96.
Capitol Equityâs actual OANDA statement reveals that Capitol Equityâs account *282
had a closing balance of $0.01 as of December 31, 2014.

45. The fake OANDA fxTrade account statement for December 2014 falsely
reflected Closing Unrealized profits of $324,000.00. Capitol Equityâs actual

OANDA statements reflect that Capitol Equityâs account *282 did not trade and
made no profits during December 2014.

46. During the Relevant Period, Defendants also provided pool participants
with fake account statements purportedly reflecting the value of pool participantsâ
individual âaccountsâ with Capitol Equity. These individual account statements
falsely represented that balances held in the pool on behalf of the pool participant had
increased in value as a result of profitable forex trading by Defendants. In reality,
pool participants accrued no profits and suffered total or near total losses of their

deposits.

 

F, Misappropriation of Pool Participantsâ Funds

47. While Defendants represented to pool participants that all pool funds
would be used to trade commodity futures or forex, only $1,190,000 of the
$1,735,750 collected from pool participants was transferred to Defendantsâ personal
trading accounts, none of which was maintained for the benefit of the pool.
Additionally, small amounts of funds were consistently transferred from the trading
accounts back into the personal bank accounts of Johnson and Marisa Johnson.

48. During the Relevant Period, instead of pooling and trading pool
participantsâ funds in commodity futures and forex as promised, Defendants
misappropriated all of the pool participantsâ funds for unauthorized purposes,

including to pay their own personal expenses, and for the benefit of Johnson and

Marisa Johnsonâs own trading accounts.

49. Johnson and Marisa Johnson used pool participantsâ funds to pay their
own personal expenses including mortgage payments, groceries, dining, gym
memberships, luxury clothing, and massages. Defendants did not disclose these
unauthorized uses of pool participantsâ funds to pool participants or prospective pool
participants.

50. Defendants also misappropriated pool participantsâ funds by transferring
pool participantsâ funds to Johnson and to Marisa Johnson via wire transfers, check
payments, and cash withdrawals. Defendants did not disclose these unauthorized
uses of pool participantsâ funds to pool participants or prospective pool participants.

51. Defendants also used pool participantsâ funds to pay purported profits to
other pool participants in order to create the illusion that the Capitol Equity pool was
profitable, when in fact it was not. Defendants did not disclose the nature of these
payments to pool participants or prospective pool participants.
