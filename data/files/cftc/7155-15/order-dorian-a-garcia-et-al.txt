ORDER

This matter comes before the Court on Plaintiff United States Commodity Futures
Trading Commission ("Commission" or "CFTC")'s Emergency Ex Parte Statutory
Restraining Order filed under seal on April 14, 2015.

Contemporaneously with the instant Motion, the Commission filed a Complaint for
Injunctive and Other Relief and Penalties. The Commission moves under Section
6c(a) of the Commodity Exchange Act (the "Act"), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(a), for an ex parte
statutory restraining order freezing assets and prohibiting the destruction of books,
records, or other documents. Having considered the pleadings, declarations,
exhibits, and memorandum filed in support of the Commission's Motion for an Ex

Parte Statutory Restraining Order, the Court finds as follows:

3-11
Case 2:15-cv-00237-SF@*CM Document 11 Filed 04/15/15âRage 2 of 10 PagelD 104

a. This Court has jurisdiction over the parties and over the subject matter
ofthis action under Sections 2(c)(2) and 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 2(c)(2) and 13a-1
(2012), which authorize the Commission to seek injunctive relief against any person
whenever it shall appear that such person has engaged, is engaging, or is about to
engage in any act or practice constituting a violation of any provision of the Act or any
tule, regulation, or order thereunder.

Bi Venue lies properly within this District under Section 6c(e) of the Act, 7
U.S.C.Â§ 13a-1(e) (2012), in that Defendants are found, inhabit, or transact business
in this District, and the acts and practices in violation of the Act have occurred, are
occurring or are about to occur within this District.

c. The Commission presented evidence that from May 2010 through the
present, Dorian A. Garcia, individually and as controlling person of DG Wealth
Management, Macroquantum Capital LLC, and UKUSA Currency Fund LP, and at
least two other unincorporated entities controlled by Garcia, Commodity Projections and
PredSyst, LLC (collectively referred to as "Defendants"), fraudulently solicited at least
eighty (80) individuals to invest approximately $4.7 million in pooled retail off-exchange
foreign currency contracts (commonly known as forex") on a leveraged or margined
basis, commodity options and a variety of other investment schemes. The Commission
also presented evidence that Garcia made misrepresentations and omitted material
facts to actual and prospective investors and pool participants by (1) falsely promising
their principal was protected with a large cash and collateral account; (2)
misrepresenting the total amount of funds managed; (3) falsely reporting historically

large profits in existing trading accounts; and (4) failing to disclose that he
Case 2:15-cv-00237-SP@*â¬M Document 11 Filed 04/15/15-Rage 3 of 10 PagelD 105

misappropriated investor funds. These representations and omissions, among others,
operated as a fraud or deceit upon actual and prospective investors and pool
participants. The Commission also presented evidence that Garcia's misrepresentations
continued for more than four (4) years and became an integral part of Garcia's
underlying fraud of operating a Ponzi scheme and misappropriating investor funds.

d. Weighing the equities and considering the Commission's likelihood of
success in its claims for relief, the issuance of a statutory restraining order is in the
public interest and there is good cause to believe that Defendants have engaged in,
are engaging in, or are about to engage in fraudulent conduct in violation of Sections
4b(a)(2)(A)-(C), 4c(b), 40(1) and 6(c)(1), of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6b(a)(2)(A)-(C),
6c(b), 60(1) and 9(1) (2012), and Regulations 4.20(c), 5.2(b)(J)-(3), 33.10, and 180.1,
17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 4.20(c), 5.2(b)(1)-(3), 33.10 and 180.1 (2014), and by failing to register
in various capacities, in violation of Sections 2(c)(2)(C)(iii)(1)(cc), 4k(2) and 4m(1) of
the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 2(c)(2)(C)(iii)(I)(cc), 6k(2) and 6m(1), and Regulations 3.12,
5.3(a)(2)(i)-(ii), 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 3.12, 5.3 (a)(2)(i), 5.3(a)(2)(ii) (2014).

e. There is good cause to believe that immediate and irreparable damage
to the Court's ability to grant effective final relief for pool participants in the form of
monetary redress will occur from the sale, transfer, assignment, or other disposition
by Defendants of assets or records unless Defendants are immediately restrained
and enjoined by Order of the Court.

f. There is good cause for the Court to freeze assets owned, controlled,

managed, or held by or on behalf of, or for the benefit of Defendants. Absent the entry
Case 2:15-cv-00237-SP@*EM Document 11 Filed 04/15/15-eRage 4 of 10 PagelD 106

of this statutory restraining order, Defendants are likely to dissipate or transfer assets
and destroy business records.

g. There is good cause for entry of an order prohibiting Defendants, their
agents, servants, employees, assigns, attorneys, and persons in active concert or
participation with Defendants, including any successor thereof, from destroying records
and/or denying agents of the Commission immediate and complete access to
Defendantsâ books and records for inspection and copying.

h. This is a proper case for granting an ex parte statutory restraining order
to preserve the status quo, protect public investors and pool participants from loss
and damage, and enable the Commission to fulfill its statutory duties.

Accordingly, it is

ORDERED:

(1) Plaintiff United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission's Under
