ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTION 6(c) AND (d) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, MAKING
FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL sanctions

I. INTRODUCTION

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ) has reason to believe that
from June 5, 2015 to June 28, 2019 (âRelevant Periodâ), Respondent Marex North America LLC
(hereinafter âRespondentâ or âMarexââ) violated Section 4f(b) of the Commodity Exchange Act
(âActâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6f(b) (2018), and Regulation 1.17(a)(1)@)(B), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.17(a)1)G@)(B)
(2019) of the Commission Regulations (âRegulationsâ) promulgated thereunder. Therefore, the
Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest that public administrative
proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted to determine whether Respondent engaged in the
violations set forth herein and to determine whether any order should be issued imposing
remedial sanctions.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Respondent has
submitted an Offer of Settlement (âOfferâ), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Without admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, Respondent consents to

' Respondent consents to the use of the findings of fact and conclusions of law in this Order in this proceeding and

proceeding in bankruptcy or receivership; or a proceeding to enforce the terms of this Order. Respondent does not
consent to the use of the Offer or this Order, or the findings or conclusions in this Order, by any other party in any

II. FINDINGS
The Commission finds the following:
A. SUMMARY

Marex, a registered futures commission merchant (âFCMââ) with the Commission, enters
orders and executes trades on a number of designated contract markets on behalf of customers.

During the Relevant Period, Marex improperly accounted for deductions arising out of an
agreement it entered to guarantee a line of credit for an affiliated company (the âRestatement
Agreementâ), in computing its adjusted net capital. Consequently, Marex failed to meet its
adjusted net capital requirements during thirty-three months of the Relevant Period by failing to
properly deduct the amount of the guaranteed drawdown under the revolving line of credit
(hereinafter âdrawdownââ) in calculating its adjusted net capital. Marex continued to operate as a
FCM while failing to maintain the minimum adjusted net capital required of a FCM.

Accordingly, Respondent violated Section 4f(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6f(b) (2018) and
Regulation 1.17(a)(1)G)(B), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.17(a)(1)@)(B) (2019).

B. RESPONDENT

Marex North America LLC is registered with the Commission as a FCM, with its
principal place of business located at 360 Madison Ave., 3" Floor, New York, New York 10017.
It has been continuously registered as a FCM since November 23, 2010.

C. FACTS

On June 5, 2015, Marex entered into the Restatement Agreement under which it agreed to
guarantee drawdowns of a revolving line of credit provided to an affiliated company by a
banking syndicate. Marex subsequently entered a âRelease Agreementâ (the âRelease
Agreementâ) on June 28, 2019, with the same syndicate of banks, which terminated Marexâs
obligations under the Restatement Agreement.

During the time period in which Marex was bound as a guarantor of drawdowns of the
revolving line of credit, funds were periodically drawn on the line of credit for the benefit of the
affiliated company, in amounts ranging from ten million dollars to one-time ninety-five million
dollars. Marex did not deduct the amount of the guaranteed drawdown in its calculation of
adjusted net capital during any month during the Relevant Period in which there was a
drawdown. If the drawdowns had been accurately reflected in Marexâs calculation of adjusted
net capital, Marexâs adjusted net capital would have been below the required amount in thirty-
three of the forty-eight months it was bound by the Restatement Agreement. The resulting
deficits in adjusted net capital ranged from approximately $4 million to $75 million dollars in
particular months. Marex continued to operate as an FCM throughout these months despite these
deficits.
Il. LEGAL DISCUSSION
A. Marex Failed to Meet its Minimum Financial Requirements

FCMs function as the commodity marketâs equivalent of a securities brokerage house,
soliciting and accepting orders and funds for futures contracts and extending credit in connection
therewith. See First American Discount Corp. v. CFTC, 222 F.3d 1008, 1010 (D.C. Cir. 2000). The
Act and Regulations set forth minimum financial requirements for FCMs to insure that FCMs meet
their obligations as registrants. See Revised Adjusted Net Capital Requirements for Futures
Commission Merchants and Introducing Brokers [Final Rule], 74 Fed. Reg. 69279 (Dec. 31,
<<<<<<< HEAD:data/future/files/cftc/8253-20/order-marex-north-america-llc.txt
2009). Marex failed to reflect a guarantee of an affiliateâs liability as a deduction in computing
Marexâs adjusted net capital. Reflecting the amount of the guarantee would have resulted in Marex
being undercapitalized and in violation of the minimum financial requirements as set forth in the Act
=======
2009). Marex failed to reflect a guarantee of an affiliate’s liability as a deduction in computing
Marex’s adjusted net capital. Reflecting the amount of the guarantee would have resulted in Marex
being undercapitalized and in violations of the minimum financial requirements as set forth in the Act
>>>>>>> fix_datapoint:data/cftc_next_step/8253-20/order-marex-north-america-llc.txt
and Commission Regulations. Marex continued to operate as a FCM while undercapitalized.

1. Marex Should have Taken a Deduction in Computing Net Capital for the
Drawdowns

Section 4f(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6f(b) (2018), provides in part:

[N]o person desiring to register as futures commission merchant or
as introducing broker shall be so registered unless he meets such
minimum financial requirements as the Commission may by
regulation prescribe as necessary to insure his meeting his
obligations as a registrant, and each person so registered shall at all
times continue to meet such prescribed minimum financial
requirements ....

Regulation 1.17(a)()@), 17 C.F.R Â§ 1.17(a)(1)G) (2019), provides in relevant part that, an
FCM's adjusted net capital requirement is the greater of $1,000,000 or the âfutures commission
merchantâs risk-based capital requirement, computed as eight percent of the total risk margin
requirement for positions carried by the futures commission merchant in customer accounts and
noncustomer accounts.â

Adjusted net capital is calculated by deducting total liabilities from total current assets to
arrive at net capital, from which certain charges are deducted as a cushion against potential
decreases in market value to arrive at adjusted net capital. See Regulation 1.17(c)(1) and (5),

17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.17(c)C1), (5) (2019). E.g., In re First Commercial Fin. Grp., Inc., CFTC No. 95-
10, 1999 WL 325338, n.3 at *9 (May 20, 1999).

Marex was required to take a deduction in computing its adjusted net capital equal to the
amount of the drawdowns on the line of credit subject to the Restatement Agreement.
Regulation 1.17(f)(4), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.17(f)(4) (2019), states: âNo applicant or registrant shall
guarantee, endorse, or assume directly or indirectly any obligation or liability of a subsidiary or
affiliate unless the obligation or liability is reflected in the computation of adjusted net capital
pursuant to [. . .] this section.â
2. Marex Failed to Meet its Minimum Financial Requirements Because it Failed
to Take a Deduction in Computing its Adjusted Net Capital for the
Drawdowns

If the Restatement Agreement had been reflected as a deduction in the calculation of
Marexâs adjusted net capital during the months when there were drawdowns on the line of credit,
Marex would be deemed to have failed to meet its minimum capital requirement for thirty-three
months during the Relevant Period.

IV. FINDINGS OF violations

Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that, during the Relevant Period, Marex
violated Section 4f(b) of the Commodity Exchange Act (âActâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6f(b) (2018), and
Regulation 1.17(a)(1)G)(B), 17 C.F.R. { 1.17(a)(1)G)(B) (2019).
