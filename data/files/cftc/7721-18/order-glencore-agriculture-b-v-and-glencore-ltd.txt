ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTION 6(c) AND (d) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, MAKING
FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

I.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ) has reason to believe that
on multiple occasions between January 2013 and November 2015 (the âRelevant Periodââ),
Glencore Agriculture B.V., f/k/a Glencore Grain B.V. (âGlencore Grain B.V.â),â and Glencore
Ltd. (together, âRespondentsâ violated Sections 4a(b) and 4c(a) of the Commodity Exchange
Act (âActâ), 7 U.S.C. 8Â§ 6a(b), 6c(a) (2012), and Regulations 150.2 and 1.38(a) of the
Commission Regulations (âRegulationsâ) promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 150.2, 1.38(a)
(2017); and Glencore Grain B.V. violated Regulation 19.01, 17 C.F.R. Â§19.01 (2017).
Therefore, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest that public
administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted to determine whether Respondents
engaged in the violations set forth herein and to determine whether any order should be issued
imposing remedial sanctions.

Il.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Respondents have
submitted an Offer of Settlement (âOfferâ), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Without admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, Respondents consent to
the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Section 6(c) and (d) of the Commodity
Exchange Act, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (âOrderâ) and acknowledge
service of this Order.â

 

' Since the Relevant Period, Glencore Grain B.V. changed its name to Glencore Agriculture B.V. Because the entity
was known as Glencore Grain B.V. during the Relevant Period, this Order will refer to Glencore Grain B.V.

* Respondents consent to the use of the findings of fact and conclusions of law in this Order in this proceeding and
in any other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party or claimant, and agree
that they shall be taken as true and correct and be given preclusive effect therein, without further proof.
Respondents do not consent, however, to the use of this Order, or the findings or conclusions herein, as the sole
II.
The Commission finds the following:
A. SUMMARY

Glencore Grain B.V. and Glencore Ltd. engaged in cotton trading activities under
common control within the larger Glencore plc organization (âGlencoreââ). Nevertheless, on
multiple trading days during May 2013, June 2013, May 2014, and June 2014, Glencore Grain
B.V. and Glencore Ltd. held net positions in the ICE Futures Cotton No. 2 contracts (âcotton
futuresâ) that, on an aggregated basis, exceeded the speculative position limits established by the
Commission. In addition, on twenty-four occasions between January 2013 and November 2015,
Glencore Grain B.V. and Glencore Ltd. executed exchange of futures for physical transactions
(âEFPsââ) opposite each otherâs cotton futures trading accounts, even though their accounts were
not independently controlled as required for such transactions not to constitute illegal wash
trades. And on at least two occasions in 2013 and 2014, Glencore Grain B.V. submitted to the
Commission a Form 304 that failed to represent accurately all required information, including its
short cash sales commitments.

B. RESPONDENTS

Glencore Grain B.V. is a global operation that originates agricultural commodities,
including cotton, grains, and oilseeds, and markets and distributes them to customers around the
world. Glencore Grain B.V. is headquartered in Rotterdam, Netherlands, and works with field
offices and Glencore affiliates to operate its global business. Since the Relevant Period,
Glencore Grain B.V. has changed its name to Glencore Agriculture B.V. Glencore Grain B.V. is
not and was not registered with the Commission.

Glencore Ltd. is a commodities supplier and trader headquartered in Stamford,
Connecticut. During the Relevant Period, Glencore Ltd. was an affiliate of Glencore Grain B.V.,
which served as its supplier of cotton in the United States. Since the Relevant Period, Glencore
Ltd. was restructured, and its former cotton trading business is now conducted through a
different corporate entity, Glencore Agriculture USA LLC. Glencore Ltd. is not and was not
registered with the Commission.

C. FACTS

Glencore Grain B.V. and Glencore Ltd. are affiliated companies that, during the Relevant
Period, both engaged in cotton trading activities as part of Glencoreâs overall global cotton
business. Glencore Grain B.V. engaged in the global marketing and distribution of cotton,
working with local field offices and Glencore affiliates to source cotton on a local level.
Glencore Ltd. operated as Glencoreâs primary trader of U.S. origin cotton, sourcing cotton from

 

basis for any other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party or claimant, other
than: a proceeding in bankruptcy or receivership; or a proceeding to enforce the terms of this Order. Respondents
do not consent to the use of the Offer or this Order, or the findings or conclusions in this Order, by any other party in
any other proceeding.
U.S.-based producers, and selling the majority of its product to Glencore Grain B.V. Both
Glencore Grain B.V. and Glencore Ltd. were reportable cotton dealers/merchants to the
Commission.

At all times relevant to this Order, Glencore centralized the management of its global
cotton business under the direction of a single trading manager (âHead of Cottonâ), who oversaw
cotton operations across all Glencore entities. The Head of Cotton directly supervised cotton
traders at Glencore Grain B.V. and was also the direct supervisor of Glencore Ltd.âs head cotton
trader. In his role, the Head of Cotton oversaw and communicated overarching cotton strategies
and policies across Glencore entities. One such policy required Glencore Ltd. to hedge any
physical cotton transaction in the futures market. The Head of Cotton remained generally
apprised of trader activities and positions across Glencore entities and participated in discussions
regarding certain trade-level decisions at both Glencore Grain B.V. and Glencore Ltd.

The Act and Regulations set limits on the net long or net short position that any person
may hold or control for certain commodities, including a limit of 5,000 cotton futures for a single
month, other than the spot month, exclusive of bona fide hedging transactions. Because
Glencore Grain B.V. and Glencore Ltd. operated their cotton trading under the common control
of Glencoreâs Head of Cotton, their cotton futures positions should have been aggregated for
purposes of complying with the Commissionâs position limits. When aggregated, the cotton
futures positions of Glencore Grain B.V. and Glencore Ltd. exceeded 5,000 net contracts,
exclusive of bona fide hedging transactions, on multiple days during May 2013, June 2013, May
2014, and June 2014.

The Act and Regulations permit noncompetitive trading, such as EFPs, only if such
transactions are conducted in accordance with rules of an exchange, such as the Intercontinental
Exchange (âICEâ), that are approved by the Commission. At all times relevant to this Order,
ICE rules permitted the transaction of EFPs between independently controlled accounts.
However, Glencore Grain B.V.âs and Glencore Ltd.âs cotton futures trading accounts were both
ultimately controlled by Glencoreâs Head of Cotton. As a result they were not independently
controlled. Nevertheless, between January 2013 and November 2015, Glencore Grain B.V. and
Glencore Ltd. executed twenty-four EFPs opposite one anotherâs accounts.

The Regulations require cotton merchants and dealers holding or controlling reportable
futures positions to file a monthly Statement of Cash Positions in Cotton (âForm 304â), as of the
close of business on the last Friday of the month. On the Form 304, entities report the
composition of their fixed price cash position in cotton and cotton products, including the
quantity of open fixed price purchase and fixed price sale commitments. One purpose of the
Form 304 report is to check compliance with speculative position limits by ensuring that filers
that classify their futures positions as hedging actually own or control offsetting cash positions.
Glencore Grain B.V. filed two erroneous Form 304 reports with the Commissionâone on May
31, 2013 and a second on May 30, 2014âthat overstated the quantities of its fixed price cotton
cash positions.

In January 2016, Glencore Ltd. was restructured, and its former cotton trading business
began to be conducted through a different corporate entity, Glencore Agriculture USA LLC.
Thereafter, Glencore Grain B.V. and Glencore Agriculture USA LLC began aggregating their
cotton futures positions and ceased transacting EFPs between their accounts. Glencore Grain
B.V. also took corrective action with respect to its erroneous Form 304 reports.

IV. LEGAL DISCUSSION

A. Respondentsâ Aggregated Cotton Positions Exceeded the Regulatory Position Limits
in Violation of Section 4a(b) and Regulation 150.2.

Section 4a(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6a(b) (2012), makes it âunlawful for any person
directly or indirectly to hold or control a net long or net short position in any commodity for
future delivery .. . in excess of any position limit fixed by the Commission for or with respect to
such commodity.â Regulation 150.2, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 150.2 (2017), sets the single month speculative
position limit for the Cotton No. 2 futures contract at 5,000 contracts. Pursuant to Regulation
150.3, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 150.3 (2017), that position limit is exclusive of any bona fide hedging
transactions. During the Relevant Period, Regulation 150.4, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 150.4 (2014), which
addresses the aggregation of positions, provided that â[t]he position limits set forth in Â§ [15]0.2
of this part shall apply to all positions in accounts for which any person by power of attorney or
otherwise directly or indirectly holds positions or controls trading.â

The Commission does not need to establish scienterâi.e., proof of intent to exceed the
applicable position limitâin order to prove a violation of speculative position limits. See CFTC
v. Hunt, 591 F.2d 1211, 1218 (7th Cir. 1979) (discounting a scienter requirement because âthere
is nothing in either the statutory language or legislative history which suggests that intent either
to affect market prices or specific intent to exceed the speculative limits is a necessary element of
a violationâ of the Act); cf Saberi v. CFTC, 488 F.3d 1207, 1212 n.4 (9th Cir. 2007) (noting that
a dispute over whether a contract market position limit violation was intentional is ânot relevant
to liabilityâ because there is âno mens rea requirementâ).

Because Glencoreâs Head of Cotton directly or indirectly controlled the cotton trading at
both Glencore Grain B.V. and Glencore Ltd., Respondentsâ Cotton No. 2 positions should have
been aggregated for position limit purposes during the Relevant Period. By exceeding, on an
aggregated basis, the 5,000 single month limit, exclusive of any bona fide hedging transactions,
on multiple days during four months of the Relevant Period, Respondents violated Section 4a(b)
of the Act and Regulation 150.2.

B. Respondents Entered into EFPs in Violation of Section 4c(a) of the Act and
Regulation 1.38(a).

Section 4c(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6c(a) (2012), makes it unlawful to engage in any
transaction that is of the character of, or commonly known to the trade, as a âwash saleâ or that is
a fictitious sale. Regulation 1.38(a), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.38(a) (2017), requires futures contracts to be
executed âopenly and competitivelyâ and permits noncompetitive trading only if executed âin
accordance with written rules of the contract market which have been submitted to and approved

 

* The Commission amended the text and structure of Regulation 150.4 since the conclusion of the Relevant Period.
The current version Regulation 150.4 likewise requires aggregation of âall positions in accounts for which any
person, by power of attorney or otherwise, directly or indirectly controls trading or holds a 10 percent or greater
ownership or equity interest.â 17 C.F.R. Â§ 150.4 (2017).
by the Commission, specifically providing for the noncompetitive execution of such
transactions.â During the Relevant Period, ICE Rule 4.06 permitted EFP transactions under
certain circumstances between âindependently controlled accounts.â At no time relevant to this
Order did ICE rules approved by the Commission permit EFPs, noncompetitive trades, between
accounts operating under common control.

Because Glencoreâs Head of Cotton directly or indirectly controlled the cotton trading at
both Glencore Grain B.V. and Glencore Ltd., Respondentsâ cotton trading accounts were not
âindependently controlled accounts.â By executing twenty-four EFPs opposite each otherâs
cotton futures trading accounts between January 2013 and November 2015, Respondents
violated Section 4c(a) of the Act and Regulation 1.38(a).

C. Glencore Grain B.V. Filed Erroneous Form 304 Reports in Violation of Regulation
19.01.

Regulation 19.00(a)(1) requires that persons holding or controlling futures and options
positions in cotton that are reportable pursuant to Regulation 15.00(p)(2), 17 C.P.R. Â§15.00(p)(2)
(2017), and any part of which constitute bona fide hedging positions as defined in Regulation
1.3(z), 17 C.P.R. Â§ 1.3(z) (2017), must file a Form 304 report showing the composition of its
fixed price cotton cash position. Reportable positions under Regulation 15.00(p)(2) are any
combined futures and futures equivalent option open contract position as defined in Part 150 of
the Regulations in any one month or in all months combined, either net long or net short in any
commodity on any one reporting market, which positions at the close of the market on the last
business day of the week. Regulation 19.01(a), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 19.01(a) (2017), requires Form 304
reports to show the quantities of the fixed price cotton purchase and sale open cash positions.

During the Relevant Period, Glencore Grain B.V. held reportable cotton futures positions
and was required by Regulation 19.00(a)(1) to file Form 304 reports. On two occasions during
the Relevant Period, Glencore Grain B.V. submitted Form 304 reports that overstated the
quantities of its fixed price cotton cash positions. By submitting these erroneous Form 304
reports, Glencore Grain B.V. violated Regulation 19.01.

V. FINDINGS OF VIOLATIONS

Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that, during the Relevant Period, Glencore
Grain B.V. and Glencore Ltd. violated Sections 4a(b) and 4c(a) of the Commodity Exchange
Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6a(b), 6c(a) (2012), and Regulations 150.2 and 1.38(a), 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 150.2,
1.38(a) (2017); and Glencore Grain B.V. violated Regulation 19.01, 17 C.F.R. Â§19.01 (2017).
