ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTIONS 6(c) AND 6(d) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, MAKING
FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

I.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ or âCFTCâ) has reason to
believe that Deutsche Bank AG (âDeutsche Bankâ or âRespondentâ) has violated Sections 6(c),
6(d) and 9(a)(2) of the Commodity Exchange Act (the âActâ or the âCEAâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 9, 13b
and 13(a)(2) (2006). Therefore, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest
that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted to determine whether
Respondent has engaged in the violations set forth herein, and to determine whether any order
shall be issued imposing remedial sanctions.

I.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Respondent has
submitted an Offer of Settlement (âOfferââ), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Without admitting or denying the findings or conclusions herein, except to the extent Respondent
admits those findings in any related action against Deutsche Bank by, or any agreement with, the
Department of Justice or any other governmental agency or office, Respondent herein consents
to the entry and acknowledges service of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Sections
6(c) and 6(d) of the Commodity Exchange Act, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial
Sanctions (âOrderâ),

 

Respondent consents to the entry of this Order and to the use of these findings in this proceeding and
in any other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party; provided,
however, that Respondent does not consent to the use of the Offer, or the findings or conclusions in this
Order, as the sole basis for any other proceeding brought by the Commission, other than in a proceeding
in bankruptcy or to enforce the terms of this Order. Nor does Respondent consent to the use of the Offer
or this Order, or the findings or conclusions in this Order consented to in the Offer, by any other party in
any other proceeding.

 
Il.

The Commission finds the following:

A, Summary

For more than six years, from at least 2005 through early 2011 (the ârelevant periodâ),
Deutsche Bank, by and through the acts of certain employees, engaged in systemic and pervasive
misconduct directed at manipulating critical, international financial benchmark rates, the London
Interbank Offered Rate (âLIBORâ) and the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (âEuriborââ). Deutsche
Bankâs profit-driven misconduct undermined the integrity of LIBOR and Euribor and the
integrity of the U.S. and global financial markets.

LIBOR and Euribor are the basis for trillions of dollars of financial instruments,
particularly derivatives contracts, including interest rate swaps and futures contracts. The
Eurodollar futures contract traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (âCMEâ) is one of the
largest futures contract in the world based on open interest and notional value of trading volume
and settles against U.S. Dollar LIBOR. Rates for consumer loans, such as mortgages, student
loans, car loans, and credit card accounts, are tied to LIBOR. Markets, investors and consumers
around the world rely on the integrity of these benchmark rates.

The benchmark rates are determined by contributions from select panel banks, including
Deutsche Bank, and are supposed to reflect each bankâs honest assessment of the costs of
borrowing unsecured funds in the cash markets. More than two dozen Deutsche Bank traders and
benchmark submitters violated this fundamental precept by focusing on the need to generate
trading profits instead of providing honest and accurate information to the relevant cash markets.
As aresult, Deutsche Bank routinely based its U.S. Dollar, Yen, Sterling, and Swiss Franc
LIBOR and Euribor submissions on its cash and derivatives trading positions, the profitability of
which were tied to LIBOR and Euribor. Through its regular, false LIBOR and Euribor
submissions, Deutsche Bank routinely attempted to manipulate LIBOR and Euribor in order to
ensure that the published rates for each benchmark benefited its trading positions. At times,
Deutsche Bank was successful in its attempts to manipulate LIBOR for U.S. Dollar, Yen,
Sterling, and Swiss Franc, and Euribor.

Over this more than six year period and across currencies, Deutsche Bankâs submitters
routinely took into account other Deutsche Bank tradersâ derivatives trading positions, as well as
their own cash and derivatives trading positions, when making the bankâs LIBOR and Euribor
submissions. On other occasions, Deutsche Bank aided and abetted other panel banksâ attempts
to manipulate Euribor and Yen LIBOR. The conduct of Deutsche Bankâs submitters, traders,
desk managers, and at least one senior manager was systemic and pervasive, occurring across

 
multiple trading desks and offices, including London, Frankfurt, New York, Tokyo,â and
Singapore.â

Allowing submitters and traders to prioritize profit motives over appropriate submission
considerations, Deutsche Bank permitted a culture of trader self-interest to exist and created
conflicts of interest, which allowed the misconduct to occur. Certain managers encouraged
continual information sharing between derivatives traders, money market traders, and submitters
for the various benchmarks, even restructuring business lines such that, in Deutsche Bankâs
London office, derivatives traders and submitters sat together. In addition to making routine
written requests for beneficial LIBOR and Euribor submissions, the traders often shouted their
requests for beneficial submissions across the trading floor to the submitters.â A senior managerâ
regularly sat with the traders and encouraged them and their counterparts in other offices to
communicate and exchange trading positions, so submitters became clearly aware of the
submissions that were most favorable to the various desksâ trading positions. Senior desk
managers in London, Frankfurt, New York, and in the Deutsche Tokyo Subsidiary also made
requests to benefit their own trading positions, facilitated the requests from their.traders for
beneficial submissions, and generally promoted the practice of inappropriately using benchmark
interest rate submissions to help the traders increase profits and minimize losses on their and the
deskâs trading positions. The cash and derivatives trading on the desks responsible for Deutsche
Bankâs misconduct increased throughout the relevant period and the desks generated significant
revenues for Deutsche Bank, particularly during the global financial crisis of 2007 through 2009.

Despite the obvious conflict of interest, Deutsche Bank, at times, allowed its traders who
primarily traded derivatives, such as its Yen derivatives trader, to be responsible for making its
submissions, thus making it easy to skew the bankâs submissions to benefit their own positions
and to accommodate the requests of their fellow derivatives traders.Â° These improper submission

Tokyo Subsidiaryâ). The Deutsche Tokyo Subsidiary is the brokerage and investment banking arm
located in Tokyo, Japan for Deutsche Bank AG. It is not registered with the Commission in any capacity.
> Deutsche Bankâs misconduct extended beyond the LIBOR and Euribor benchmarks. Through its
internal investigation, Deutsche Bank identified evidence of similar misconduct with respect to attempts
to influence, and at times attempts to manipulate, other interest rate benchmarks, including, but not
limited to, Singapore Interbank Offered Rate, Singapore Swap Offer Rate, and Tom/Next Indexed Swaps
for the Swiss Franc.

For purposes of this Order, the term ârequestâ means a request for a preferential LIBOR or Euribor
submission for a particular tenor.

5 . . :
The term âsenior managementâ or âsenior managerâ refers to Deutsche Bank employees with

responsibilities (formally or informally delegated) broader than the management of trading desks,
although their responsibilities may have at times included managing trading desks. The term âsenior
managementâ or âsenior managerâ does not include executive managers or members of Deutsche Bankâs
Management Board, Supervisory Board, or Group Executive Committee,

Â° In June 2008, the British Bankersâ Association (âBBAâ) clarified in guidance provided to panel banks
that the basis for a bankâs submission must be the rates at which bank staff members primarily
responsible for management of the bankâs cash, rather than the bankâs derivative trading book, consider

3

 
practices continued even after the BBA, the trade association responsible for the management
and publication of LIBOR, clarified in June 2008 that submissions should be made by those who
are responsible for management of the bankâs cash, rather than the bankâs derivatives trading
book. One particular Deutsche Bank derivatives trader-submitter used his position as the bankâs
submitter to assist the senior yen trader at UBS (âUBS Senior Yen Traderâ) in his massive
scheme to manipulate Yen LIBOR over the same relevant period.â

As a result of this profit-based submission process, improper written and oral submission
requests were common practice, and LIBOR and Euribor submitters routinely skewed Deutsche
Bankâs contributions, routinely made false submissions, and routinely attempted to manipulate,
and, at times, successfully manipulated LIBOR and Euribor. Thus, Deutsche Bankâs LIBOR and
Euribor submissions were not a reflection of Deutsche Bankâs honest assessment of the costs of
borrowing funds in the relevant interbank markets, as required by each of the benchmarksâ
definitions,

Deutsche Bankâs traders were able to accommodate and facilitate the attempts to
manipulate LIBOR and Euribor for years because Deutsche Bank lacked internal controls,
procedures and policies concerning its LIBOR and Euribor submission processes, and failed to
adequately supervise its trading desks and traders. Deutsche Bank did not have any policies,
internal controls, or procedures for determining or monitoring its submissions to ensure that
Deutsche Bankâs LIBOR and Euribor submissions reflected an honest assessment of the costs of -
borrowing unsecured funds in the interbank markets. Deutsche Bankâs failure to provide internal
training or implement standards addressing benchmark interest rate submissions, allowance of
inappropriate communications amongst traders and submitters, and related conflicts of interest
amplified the potential for misconduct and permitted the misconduct to continue for a number of
years. Deutsche Bank engaged in this wrongful conduct even after the Division of Enforcement
requested in April 2010 that Deutsche Bank conduct an internal investigation of its U.S. Dollar
LIBOR submission practices. In fact, Deutsche Bank did not make meaningful improvements in
its internal controls until mid-2011 and did not formalize a policy about conflicts of interest
among traders and submitters relating to benchmark submissions until February, 2013.

that the bank can borrow unsecured interbank funds in the London market. The BBA also clarified that
panel banks could not contribute a rate based on the pricing of any derivative financial instrument.

7 On December 19, 2012, the Commission issued an Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Sections

6(c) and 6(d) of the Commodity Exchange Act Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions
against UBS AG and UBS, finding, among other things, that UBS AG and UBS, through the UBS Senior
Yen Trader, attempted to manipulate Yen LIBOR, at times successfully, through multiple methods. The
Commissionâs Order found that one of the UBS Senior Yen Traderâs strategies included coordinating
with traders at other Yen panel banks, including Deutsche Bank, identified in the Order as the Yen Bank
F, to attempt to manipulate Yen LIBOR by making false Yen LIBOR submissions beneficial to their
respective derivatives trading positions. See In re UBS AG et al., CFTC Docket No. 13-09 (CFTC filed
December 19, 2012), available at
http:/Awww.cfite.gov/ucm/groups/public/@lrenforcementactions/documents/legalpleading/enfubsorder121

912.pdf.

 
In accepting Deutsche Bankâs Offer, the Commission recognizes Respondentâs
cooperation with the Division of Enforcementâs investigation of this matter. The Commission
notes that at the outset of the Division of Enforcementâs investigation in April 2010 and
continuing until mid-2011, Deutsche Bankâs cooperation was not sufficient, and, in part, this
affected a timely resolution of this matter. After mid-2011, Deutsche Bank provided significant
cooperation and assistance to the Division of Enforcement.

B. Respondent

Deutsche Bank AG is a German global banking and financial services company
headquartered in Frankfurt, Germany. Deutsche Bank operates in over 70 countries and has
offices in major financial centers including Frankfurt, London, New York City, Tokyo,
Singapore, and Hong Kong. On December 31, 2012, Deutsche Bank AG was provisionally
registered as a swap dealer with the Commission.

Cc. Facts
1. The Fixing of LIBOR and Euribor
a. LIBOR and its Fixing

LIBOR is the most widely used benchmark interest rate in the world and affects market
participants and consumers throughout the world, including in the United States. LIBOR is used
as a barometer to measure strain in money markets and is often a gauge of the marketâs
expectation of future central bank interest rates. LIBOR is used in interest rate transactions,
including loans, over-the-counter swaps, and exchange-traded interest rate futures and options
contracts on many of the worldâs major futures and options exchanges. For example, U.S. Dollar
LIBOR is used as the basis for settlement of the CMEâs Eurodollar futures contracts. The
products indexed to LIBOR have an approximate notional value of $500 trillion.

During the relevant period, under the auspices of the BBA,Â® LIBORs were issued on a
daily basis for ten currencies, including U.S. Dollar, Yen, Sterling, and Swiss Franc, with fifteen
tenors (i.e., durations for interest rates) ranging from overnight through twelve months.â Certain
currencies, such as U.S. Dollar, Yen, Sterling, and Swiss Franc are more widely referenced in
interest rate contracts. One, three and six-months are the most common tenors referenced in
LIBOR-indexed transactions.

According to the BBA, LIBOR âis based on offered inter-bank deposit rates contributed
in accordance with the Instructions to BBA LIBOR Contributor banks.â The BBA explained
that:

 

Â® On February 1, 2014, ICE Benchmark Administration Limited was appointed as the new

administrator for LIBOR, following authorization by the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (âFCAâ).

â âTn 2013, the BBA discontinued publication of LIBOR for five currencies, namely the Canadian

Dollar, Australian Dollar, New Zealand Dollar, Danish Krone, and Swedish Krona.

5

 
[a]n individual BBA LIBOR Contributor Panel Bank will contribute the rate at
which it could borrow funds, were it to do so by asking for and then accepting
inter-bank offers in reasonable market size just prior to [11:00 a.m. London
time].

Every business day shortly before 11:00 a.m. London time, the banks on the LIBOR
panels submitted their rates to Thomson Reuters. A trimmed averaging process excluded the top

and bottom quartile of rates and the remaining rates were averaged for each tenor. That averaged
rate became the official BBA daily LIBOR (the âLIBOR fixingâ) for each tenor.

The BBA made public the daily LIBOR fixing for each currency and tenor, as well as the
daily submissions of each panel bank, through Thomson Reuters and the other data vendors
licensed by the BBA. This information was made available and relied upon by market
participants and others throughout the world, including in the United States.

By its definition, LIBOR requires that the submitting panel banks exercise their judgment
to determine the rates at which they may obtain unsecured funds in the London interbank market.
These definitions require that submissions relate to funding and do not permit consideration of
factors unrelated to the costs of borrowing unsecured funds, such as the benefit to a bankâs
derivatives or money market trading positions.â!

b. Euribor and its Fixing

Euribor is used internationally in derivatives contracts, including interest rate swaps and
futures contracts.â* According to the Bank for International Settlements, over-the-counter
interest rate derivatives, such as swaps and FRAs, comprised contracts worth over $187 trillion
in notional value at the end of 2012,

During the relevant period, daily Euribors were issued on behalf of the European Banking
Federation (âEBFâ)? for fifteen tenors, ranging from one week to twelve months. One, three
and six months are the most common tenors referenced in Euribor-indexed transactions.

 

'Â° This definition of LIBOR has been used since 1998 to the present.
'! Tn June 2008, the BBA clarified that panel banks could not contribute a rate based on the pricing of
any derivative financial instrument. BBA guidelines issued in October 2009 further clarified that LIBOR
submitters âshould not ask intermediaries where they believe LIBOR rates will set on a given day and use
this as a basis for submissions, This misses the point of the benchmark, and is a circular process that
would rapidly lead to inaccurate rates.â

2 In October 2011, the CME launched the Euribor Futures contract, which settles based on the three-

month Euribor.

The EBF is an unregulated non-profit association of the European banking sector based in Brussels,

Belgium. Among other functions, the EBF oversees the publication of Euribor.

 
According to the EBF, Euribor is defined as the rate âat which Euro interbank term
deposits are offered by one prime bank to another prime bankâ within the Economic and
Monetary Union of the European Union (âEMUâ) at 11:00 a.m. Central European Time (âCETâ)
daily.

Euribor is determined using submissions from a panel of over 40 mostly European banks
considered to be the most active in the Euro zone with the highest volume of business in the
EMU. According to the EBF instructions, panel banks âmust quote the required euro rates to the
best of their knowledge,â based on their observations of where the Euro is trading in that market.

Like the BBA panel banks, the Euribor panel banks submit their rates electronically to
Thomson Reuters, which manages the official Euribor process by collecting the submitted rates
from the contributing banks, calculating the rate, and then releasing it for publication just before
noon CET. Thomson Reuters computes that dayâs published Euribor by eliminating the highest
and lowest fifteen percent of submissions collected, and averaging the remaining submissions.
That average rate becomes the official daily EBF Euribor (the âEuribor fixingâ). On behalf of
EBF, Thomson Reuters then issues the Euribor fixing and the submissions of each panel bank to
its subscribers and other data vendors. Through these licensing agreements with third parties,
such as Thomson Reuters, EBF disseminates the information throughout the world, including in
the United States,

He oe He oe Ho 2

By their definitions, LIBOR and Euribor require that the submitting panel banks exercise
their judgment to determine the rates at which, depending on the benchmark, they or a prime
bank may obtain unsecured funds in the respective London and Euro interbank markets, These
definitions require that submissions relate to funding and do not permit consideration of factors
unrelated to the costs of borrowing unsecured funds, such as cash or derivatives trading
positions,

2. Deutsche Bankâs LIBOR and Euribor Submission Processes and the Embedded
Conflicts of Interest

a. Deutsche Bankâs Submission Processes in London and Frankfurt

Deutsche Bank is a member of both the BBA and the EBF, and is one of the panel banks
that submits rates for the determination of LIBOR for various currencies, including U.S. Dollar,
Yen, Sterling, and Swiss Franc, and Euribor.ââ During the relevant period, Deutsche Bank made
its LIBOR submissions for U.S. Dollar, Sterling, and Yen out of its London office and made
Swiss Franc LIBOR and Euribor submissions out of its Frankfurt office. Deutsche Bankâs
LIBOR and Euribor submission processes and the traders and trading desks involved in this
misconduct were part of the Global Finance and Foreign Exchange Group (âGFFXâ).

 

'* During the relevant period, Deutsche Bank was also a member of the LIBOR panels for the Canadian

Dollar, Australian Dollar, Danish Krone, New Zealand Dollar, and, beginning in June, 2006, the Swedish
Krona.

 
Deutsche Bankâs GFFX Group consisted of two main lines of businesses, including
Global Finance and FX Forwards, Included in this group were Pool Trading desks and Money
Market Derivatives (ââMMDâ) desks. Deutsche Bankâs LIBOR and Euribor submitters sat on the
Pool Trading desks, where they traded both cash and derivatives trading products. While the
submitters and other pool traders regularly transacted in interbank cash deposits and loans to
meet the bankâs funding needs each day in all currencies, they also had their own derivatives
trading books that allowed them not only to hedge risk in their cash trading but also to generate
profits for the desk in a proprietary fashion. MMD traders, who also held proprietary books,
primarily traded derivatives trading products with a focus on short term maturities from
overnight to two years. Some of the derivatives products traded by both pool and MMD traders
included futures (including the CME Eurodollar futures contract), interest rate swaps, forward
rate agreements, overnight index swaps and tenor basis swaps. The cash and derivatives
positions held by the Deutsche Bank pool traders and MMD traders were often priced off of
LIBOR and Euribor. Some of these positions settled or reset on International Monetary Market
(âIMMâ) dates, which are quarterly dates in March, June, September, and December.

The Pool Trading and MMD desks were organized by currency and comprised of senior
traders who oversaw the desks and often trained junior traders. A regional manager in Deutsche
Bankâs Frankfurt and New York offices oversaw the business lines for that location, including
the Pool Trading and MMD desks. One senior manager located in London had global
responsibility for the Pool Trading and MMD desks (âGlobal Senior Managerâ). Prior to 2006,
the Pool Trading desks and MMD desks operated mostly independent of each other, despite their
overlapping trading responsibilities.

b. The LIBOR and Euribor Submittersâ Conflicts of Interest Created by
Deutsche Bank

In 2006, Deutsche Bank merged the Pool Trading and MMD desks in its bank branches
in an effort to increase the bankâs trading profits through an alignment of the desksâ related
trading positions. The merger of the business lines resulted in the MMD derivatives traders in
Deutsche Bankâs London office sitting next to, or in close proximity to, Deutsche Bank cash
traders. Some of those cash traders were the bankâs LIBOR submitters. From London, the
Global Senior Manager instructed all traders to have open communication across offices and
instilled an expectation that.the derivatives traders and submitters would communicate routinely
about relevant market conditions and individual trading positions.

This commingling of business lines caused a significant cultural shift within the bank
globally, where traders were incentivized to engage in improper communications with the bankâs
LIBOR and Euribor submitters. As a result, traders routinely communicated to submitters their
preferential requests for LIBOR and Euribor submissions which were beneficial to individual
and desk trading positions. Because the bankâs Euribor and Swiss Franc LIBOR submissions
were set in Frankfurt, the Global Senior Manager encouraged the Frankfurt Euribor and Swiss
Franc LIBOR submitters to contact derivatives traders in London to obtain the preferred rates to
submit each day. In addition to the pervasive oral requests, some of which were shouted across
the combined trading desks, submitters and traders routinely communicated on Bloomberg chat
terminals or internal Deutsche Bank messaging systems to discuss preferential LIBOR and

 
Euribor requests. The Global Senior Manager regularly sat amongst the traders on the trading
floor and was aware of the many oral and written requests for preferential LIBOR and Euribor
submissions.

Deutsche Bank further embedded this inherent conflict of interest in its Pool Trading
desks when it allowed its pool traders to fill dual roles as both submitters and derivatives traders.
This enabled submitters to prioritize their individual and the deskâs profits over their
responsibility to make honest assessment of the costs of borrowing unsecured funds when
submitting rates to the BBA and EBF. Not only did the submitters routinely take into account
the tradersâ preferential LIBOR and Euribor requests, the submitters also regularly and
improperly considered their own trading positions when determining their LIBOR and Euribor
submissions.

Deutsche Bankâs merger of Pool Trading and MMD desks proved successful and resulted
in significant profits for the bank. For example, throughout the relevant period, the Pool Trading
and MMD desks together utilized a basis spread trading strategy (7.e., trading the spread between
two or more tenors) to generate profits. By mid-2008, during the global financial crisis, rates
among the different tenors of LIBOR and Euribor began to widen dramatically. The Global
Senior Manager and the London manager of the MMD desks (âLondon MMD Managerâ), one of
the most senior, highly regarded and highly compensated derivatives traders at Deutsche Bank,âÂ°
recognized the basis spread trading strategy as a way to generate significant profits off of the
turbulent interest rate markets, and Deutsche Bankâs traders entered into massive derivatives
basis trading positions based upon the bet that the spread between tenors would continue to
widen.

The Global Senior Manager and other senior traders often discussed this strategy openly
during weekly meetings, ensuring that their strategy was well known and utilized across currency
desks in both Pool Trading and MMD. As a result, Deutsche Bankâs LIBOR and Euribor
submitters were aware of this strategy, particularly during the financial crisis, and were
cognizant of the particular LIBOR and Euribor submissions desired by traders to benefit those
positions based on this strategy. As such, the submitters routinely built this bias into Deutsche
Bankâs LIBOR and Euribor submissions, even in the absence of oral or written communications
from traders. Deutsche Bankâs Pool Trading and MMD desks posted tremendous profits during
2008 and 2009, at the height of the financial crisis, due in part to this trading strategy.'Â°

By failing to separate responsibilities for making LIBOR and Euribor submissions from
its trading functions, Deutsche Bank allowed an environment to exist that yielded significant
opportunities for traders and submitters to attempt to manipulate LIBOR and Euribor
submissions to the benefit of the bankâs trading positions, and the traders and submitters took full

 

> The London MMD Manager relocated to Deutsche Bankâs Singapore office in March 2010, where he

became the Global Manager of MMD.
'Â° In 2007, Deutsche Bankâs MMD desks reported trading revenue and commissions of â¬399 million
(1.29% of total bank revenue); in 2008, â¬1.942 billion (14.27% of total revenue); and in 2009, â¬992
million (3.55% of total revenue).

 
advantage of those opportunities. As a result, the submitters routinely skewed Deutsche Bankâs
LIBOR and Euribor submissions to benefit the bankâs trading positions by attempting to
manipulate the fixings of LIBOR and Euribor, At times, their attempts to manipulate U.S.
Dollar, Yen, Sterling, and Swiss Franc LIBOR and Euribor were successful.

3. Deutsche Bankâs Inadequate Internal Controls and Failure to Appreciate the
Scope of Misconduct

During the relevant period, Deutsche Bank allowed the conflicts of interest to flourish by
failing to put in place sufficient benchmark-specific systems or controls surrounding risk and
compliance to adequately supervise its derivatives traders and submitters. Deutsche Bank did
not have any policies, internal controls, or procedures for determining, monitoring, or
supervising its LIBOR and Euribor submissions to ensure that Deutsche Bankâs submissions
reflected an honest assessment of the costs of borrowing unsecured funds in the relevant
interbank markets. Deutsche Bankâs failure to provide internal training or standards addressing
benchmark interest rate submissions, allowance of inappropriate communications amongst
traders and submitters, and related conflicts of interest amplified the potential for misconduct and
permitted it to continue for over six years. Further, Deutsche Bank did not begin to put into
place any specific policies, procedures, or controls around its benchmark submission processes
until mid-2011, and the Bank did not formalize a policy addressing conflicts of interests between
traders and submitters for another two years, in February 2013.

In investigating the conduct at issue here, Deutsche Bank failed to appreciate until mid-
2011 the extent to which it had systemic and pervasive manipulative conduct by its traders and
managers across multiple lines of businesses in offices around the world. As a result, this
conduct continued well after the Division of Enforcement began its investigation of Deutsche
Bankâs U.S, Dollar LIBOR submissions in early 2010.

4. Deutsche Bankâs False Reporting, Attempted Manipulation, and Manipulation
of U.S. Dollar LIBOR

During the relevant period, Deutsche Bank, through its submitters and traders, routinely
made false U.S, Dollar LIBOR submissions in furtherance of its attempts to manipulate U.S,
Dollar LIBOR. At times, they were successful in their attempts to manipulate. This misconduct
originated primarily out of Deutsche Bankâs London offices, and at times, its New York and
Frankfurt offices.

The U.S. Dollar Pool Trading desk in London was responsible for submitting Deutsche
Bankâs U.S. Dollar LIBOR submissions. The head of the U.S. Dollar pool trading desk
(âLondon Pool Trading Managerâ) oversaw various junior traders who worked daily with him
and made the bankâs U.S. Dollar LIBOR submissions under his direction. Similar to the London
MMD Manager, the London Pool Trading Manager was a well-respected Deutsche Bank trader
and highly compensated. From 2004 throughout the rest of the relevant period, a trader
supervised by the London Pool Trading Manager (âU.S. Dollar LIBOR Submitterâ) became the
primary U.S. Dollar LIBOR submitter and, at times, the London Pool Trading Manager acted as
a back-up submitter,

10

 
During the relevant period, Deutsche Bank pool and MMD traders in London routinely
made requests to the U.S. Dollar LIBOR Submitter or the London Pool Trading Manager for
submissions that would benefit their derivatives trading positions. As described above, as a
result of the pool and MMD traders working side-by-side, this conduct was pervasive with
requests for beneficial U.S. Dollar LIBOR submissions being either shouted across the trading
floor, passed from one trader to another trader sitting next to the submitter, or sent to submitters
through electronic communications. On occasion, pool and MMD traders and managers in
Deutsche Bankâs New York office and at least one pool trader in Frankfurt also asked for LIBOR
submissions that benefited their positions. The U.S, Dollar LIBOR Submitter, at times,
contacted the pool and MMD traders in the various offices to solicit whether they had requests
for beneficial LIBOR submissions. The submitter resolved any conflicts between the requests by
first checking with the London Pool Trading Manager. The U.S. Dollar LIBOR Submitter
routinely accommodated the tradersâ requests in making Deutsche Bankâs U.S. Dollar LIBOR
submissions.

The U.S. Dollar LIBOR Submitter also acted as a trader but only occasionally traded his
own book. Rather, he worked closely with the London Pool Trading Manager and other pool
and MMD traders, and was expected to understand and be aware of their derivatives trading
positions. Over the relevant period, the submitter became so familiar with the trading positions
of the U.S. Dollar traders that he either informed the traders of his intent to submit a skewed
LIBOR without waiting for a request or he simply submitted U.S. Dollar LIBOR submissions in
a manner he believed would benefit their derivatives trading positions.

As described above, Deutsche Bank U.S. Dollar pool and MMD traders, particularly the
London Pool Trading Manager, utilized the basis spread trading strategy promoted by the Global
Senior Manager and the London MMD Manager. The U.S. Dollar LIBOR Submitter was clearly
aware of this trading strategy and, throughout the relevant period, but primarily during the global
financial crisis of 2008 through 2009, often skewed, without written or oral requests from
traders, Deutsche Bankâs U.S. Dollar LIBOR submissions in order to benefit the bankâs trading
positions based on this strategy. Deutsche Bankâs U.S. Dollar Pool and MMD trading desks
were some of the most highly profitable trading desks during this time.

Below are examples of the requests that numerous traders communicated to the U.S.
Dollar Submitter and the London Pool Trading Manager:"â

March 22, 2005: (emphasis added)

U.S. Dollar LIBOR Submitter: if you need something in particular in the

In addition to the LIBOR requests traders made to benefit specific trading positions,
traders also requested gradual movements in LIBOR in order to set the trend in upcoming
LIBOR fixings to benefit longer term derivatives trading positions, which the U.S. Dollar
LIBOR submitter routinely accommodated. Similarly, the U.S. Dollar LIBOR submitter was
also aware of month-end derivatives trading positions held by the traders and often submitted
Deutsche Bank U.S. Dollar contributions skewed to benefit those positions. The submitter
routinely accommodated these requests by skewing Deutsche Bankâs daily U.S. Dollar LIBOR
contributions at month-end, over a period of days, weeks, or even months. Below are examples

of such requests:

On a handful of occasions, either the London Pool Trading Manager or the U.S. Dollar
LIBOR submitter contacted interdealer brokers in attempts to influence the overall LIBOR fixing
by requesting the brokers to make preferential LIBOR predictions in specific tenors.'* Below are
examples of these communications:

Accordingly, throughout the relevant period, Deutsche Bank routinely made false reports
regarding U.S, Dollar LIBOR and attempted to manipulate U.S. Dollar LIBOR in order to
benefit Deutsche Bankâs trading positions. As such, Deutsche Bankâs U.S. Dollar LIBOR
submissions were not made in accordance with the BBA definitions and criteria for LIBOR
submissions, At times, they were successful in their attempted manipulations.

Brokers act as intermediaries between major dealers in the cash and derivatives markets to facilitate

of deposits and loans, and in hedging those transactions with derivatives trades often referenced to
LIBOR.

S. Deutsche Bankâs False Reporting, Attempted Manipulation, and Manipulation
of Euribor

Over the relevant period, Deutsche Bankâs Euribor submitters routinely skewed Euribor
submissions based upon requests from Deutsche Bank derivatives traders for rates set to benefit
derivatives trading positions that were linked to Euribor. The Frankfurt-based submitters also
routinely took their own trading positions into account in making the bankâs Euribor
submissions, In addition, Deutsche Bank derivatives traders coordinated on several occasions
with derivatives traders at other Euribor panel banks to ensure Euribor contributions benefited
their respective trading positions. Deutsche Bank routinely made false Euribor contributions in
furtherance of its attempts to manipulate Euribor. At times, Deutsche Bank was successful in its
attempts to manipulate Euribor.

The London MMD Manager made the majority of the tradersâ requests, although several
traders on multiple desks also made such requests. The London MMD Manager, Deutsche
Bankâs highly regarded senior trader, routinely used several means in his attempts to manipulate
the Euribor fixing. His approach to manipulating Euribor encompassed the following: (1) he
regularly requested Deutsche Bank's Frankfurt-based submitters to make Euribor submissions
beneficial to his derivatives trading positions; (2) he at times worked with the Euribor submitters
to make bids or offers in the market at rates intended to influence market perception of prevailing
cash rates (known as âpushing cashâ), and, thereby, potentially influence other banksâ Euribor
submissions; (3) he coordinated on several occasions with derivatives traders at other Euribor
panel banks by entering into agreements to make requests for preferential Euribor submissions to
their respective submitters; and (4) he coordinated with traders at other Euribor panel banks to
convince interdealer brokers to post false rates on their cash market screens for the purpose of
potentially influencing other banksâ Euribor submissions.

a. Deutsche Bankâs Internal Attempts to Manipulate Euribor in Order to
Benefit Trading Positions

Deutsche Bank assigned responsibility for making its Euribor submissions to traders and
managers on the Euro Pool Trading desk in Frankfurt. Among other duties, these pool traders
had responsibility for raising cash in Euro, Swiss France and other currencies, and traded Euro-
based interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements generally tied to various tenors of
Euribor.

The Euribor submitters, some of whom were desk managers, continued the systemic
practice of focusing on their derivatives trading positions as a basis for their Euribor
submissions. The submitters also maintained daily contact with MMD Euro traders in London,
including the London MMD Manager, to ensure they were aware of the bankâs various trading
positions tied to Euribor. Multiple traders regularly and openly made requests to the submitters

 

'? At least one of the traders on the Frankfurt Non-Euro Pool Trading Desk also had responsibility for

making the bankâs Euribor submissions, either as a back-up submitter or, as of mid-2010, as part of the
team of Euribor submitters. The Deutsche Bank Swiss Franc submitter(s) involved in the Euribor
conduct described here also routinely attempted to manipulate Swiss Franc LIBOR. See infra, pp. 32-35.

15

 
for Euribor submissions beneficial to their derivatives trading positions. When requests were not
forthcoming from London, the Euribor submitters actively solicited them from the traders as part
of their effort to coordinate the officesâ trading books and the bankâs Euribor submissions in a
manner to maximize their profits.

The Euribor submitters regularly accommodated these requests unless at times the
requests conflicted with their own needs for their derivatives trading positions. As the London
MMD Managerâs stature as a successful trader grew within the bank, his requests for beneficial
Euribor submissions often were accommodated over competing requests from other traders.
When the basis trading strategy implemented by the Global Senior Manager and the London
MMD Manager began to generate significant profits in mid-2008, the Euribor submitters
understood the Euribor submission(s) needed each day to benefit the spread positions and made
their Euribor submissions accordingly, even absent a specific request from traders,

The following are some examples of the many improper communications between the
Euribor submitters and the MMD Euro traders:

July 10, 2005: (emphasis added)

much to have a high LIBOR tomorrow. So, I
don't know if you can put it high or not or
whatever it is, just to let you know, tomorrow it
suits me to have high 3s.

Umm. Yeh, there's one thing. We have to be
careful. Usually we quote below Euribor,
and right now we usually quote around 4 to 5
basis points below the expected Kuribor just
to show that we are on the better quality of
the range of the contributors,

I see ...

So that's why, right now, tf you look at our
quote compared to the other contributors...

I know, I've been noticing that, that's why I
thought I would ask you if there is there any
chance if you can put it up for me. I would
really appreciate that. Just for tomorrow, ok?

Euribor Submitter: My coworker here says something, maybe 21

June 4, 2009:
Euribor Submitter: we will know until tom morning how the others
apply trichets comments in the market i think
for fixings it sounds like a non event

 

London MMD Manager: apart from lower Imth and higher 6m
pleaaaaaaaaaaaaase
Euribor Submitter: its likely that many contributors keep their rates
| unchanged :-) except for 1m and 6m of cause
-)

The Euribor submitters and the London MMD Manager also coordinated, at times, to
âpush cashâ in the market, or, in other words, make bids or offers in the market at rates other
than what they normally would have bid or offered. By this practice, the traders intended to
signal to other market participants (including other Euribor panel bank submitters) that market
prices were moving in a certain direction, The Deutsche Bank MMD traders and submitters
wanted the other banksâ Euribor submitters to factor these market moves into their Eurtbor
submissions, thereby increasing Deutsche Bankâs chances that the Euribor fixing would move in
the direction they desired.

The following are examples of the traders and the submitters openly discussing their
strategy of pushing cash in the market:

Frankfurt Euro Desk Manager: HI MATE, JUST FOR UR GUIDE. WE

Frankfurt Euro Desk Manager: WE CONTINUE TO OFFER IM CASH IN
THE MARKTE TO KEEP 1ME FIX ON
THE LOW SIDE,

b. Deutsche Bankâs Coordination with Other Euribor Panel Banks to
Manipulate Euribor

From at least 2005 through at least 2008, the London MMD Manager coordinated with
derivatives traders at other Euribor panel banks on several occasions in attempts to manipulate
the Euribor fixing. In addition to his regular internal requests to Deutsche Bank Euribor
submitters, the London MMD Manager also utilized his friendships and past working
relationships with derivatives traders at other Eurtbor panel banks to further his attempts to
manipulate Euribor. While he spoke daily to traders at several banks and other financial

19

 
institutions, he primarily coordinated with derivatives traders at Barclaysââ (âBarclays Senior
Euro Swaps Traderâ) and at Euribor Bank A (âEuribor Bank A Swaps Traderâââ).

The London MMD Manager and these derivatives traders regularly exchanged
information about their derivatives trading positions and the Euribor fixing that they preferred to
benefit those positions. They agreed, at times, to transmit requests to their respective Euribor
submitters for Euribor submissions that would benefit their trading positions. They also
discussed reaching out to other Euribor panel banks to influence those banksâ Euribor
submissions in furtherance of their attempts to manipulate the Euribor fixings. When the
London MMD Manager was not available, he instructed the London MMD Euro Trader to
communicate his positions and Euribor preferences to at least the Barclays Senior Euro Trader or
his junior traders, and to the Deutsche Bank Euribor submitters.

The following are examples of the communications between the London MMD Manager
and the derivatives traders with whom he coordinated:

June 9, 2005: (emphasis added)
Bank A Euro Swaps Trader: Amigo checked with my FFT their 3m
euribor contribution which seems v low at

London MMD Manager: goodness! that's going to hurt
That same day:
London MMD Manager: DONT FORGET THIS HIGH 3M FIX FOR
THE FRA/EONIA SPREADS

 

*Â° On June 27, 2012, the Commission issued an Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 6(c)

and 6(d) of the Commodity Exchange Act, As Amended, Making Findings and Imposing Remedial
Sanctions against Barclays, finding, among other things, that the London MMD Manager, identified in
the Barclays Order as Trader at Bank A, and a Barclays Senior Euro Swaps Trader coordinated in their
attempts to manipulate Euribor. See In re Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC and Barclays Capital Inc.,
CFTC Docket No. 12-25 (June 27, 2012), pp. 16-17; available at

âI Tn mid-2006, Euribor Bank A Swaps Trader moved to another Euribor panel bank. The London

move big time [. . .]
London MMD Manager: seriously mate, are you really helping
[London MMD Euro Trader]
Barclays Senior Euro Swaps Trader: I'm going to help her big time

 

At times, the London MMD Manager and the derivatives traders at the other banks
attempted to manipulate Euribor to the benefit of their trading positions through the information
interdealer brokers provided to the market. They requested interdealer brokers to enter false
rates on the market screens the brokers provided to market participants in order to influence
market perception regarding prevailing cash rates. The traders believed that this could
potentially influence other banksâ Euribor submitters to make Euribor submissions that would
reflect these false rates, and, thereby, potentially move the Euribor fixing in a direction beneficial
to their respective trading positions,

The following are examples of the London MMD Managerâs discussions regarding
broker screens:

 

December 22, 2006:
Barclays Senior Euro Swaps Trader: tell [Broker 2] to raise the 6m mate important
London MMD Manager: yes yes

 

May 28, 2008: (telephone call to Barclays Euro Swaps Trader) (emphasis added)
London MMD Manager: Every day, every day I speak to my cash
desk, to the cash brokers. I say âYou have to
raise the six month, you have to raise the six
month!â

January 28, 2009: (in telephone call to another Euro derivatives trader)
London MMD Manager: ... we are still working on the, on the brokers
so that... they, they re-steepen the curve.

 

Accordingly, throughout the relevant period, Deutsche Bank routinely made false reports
regarding Euribor in attempts to manipulate Euribor in order to benefit Deutsche Bankâs trading
positions. As such, Deutsche Bankâs Euribor submissions were not made in accordance with the
EBFâs definitions and criteria for Euribor submissions. At times, they were successful in their
attempted manipulations of Euribor.

22

 
6. Deutsche Bankâs False Reporting, Attempted Manipulation, and Manipulation
of Yen LIBOR, and Coordination with UBS Senior Yen Trader

During the relevant period, Deutsche Bank, through its submitters and traders, routinely
made false submissions in attempts to manipulate Yen LIBOR. From mid-2008 through mid-
2010, one Deutsche Bank derivatives trader also routinely coordinated with a derivatives trader
at UBS in their attempts to manipulate Yen LIBOR. The Yen LIBOR misconduct perpetrated by
the Deutsche Bank traders and submitters originated out of Deutsche Bankâs London office
primarily, and, on occasion, out of the Deutsche Tokyo Subsidiary. At times, Deutsche Bank was
successful in its attempts to manipulate Yen LIBOR.

a. Deutsche Bankâs Attempts to Manipulate Yen LIBOR in Order to Benefit
Internal Trading Positions,

During the relevant period, several London-based Deutsche Bank traders handled the
responsibility for making the bankâs Yen LIBOR submissions, including the manager of the Yen
and Euro Pool Trading Desk (âYen Desk Managerââ) in London. Prior to mid-2008, the
submission process was handled by a senior Yen Pool trader (âSenior Yen LIBOR Submitterâ)
with a junior trader (âJunior Yen LIBOR Submitterâ) providing assistance.

The submitters on the Yen Pool Trading desk coordinated regularly with other Deutsche
Bank yen derivatives traders on MMD desks in London and, on occasion, with the Deutsche
Tokyo Subsidiary MMD traders, to make Yen LIBOR submissions that were beneficial to their
respective derivatives trading positions. One of the senior traders involved in making requests
on occasion was a manager in the Deutsche Tokyo Subsidiary (âTokyo Regional Managerâ).
One London-based MMD trader who made requests (âSenior Yen Trader-Submitterâ) eventually
became the Yen LIBOR submitter in mid-2008, further entrenching the inherent conflict of
interest permitted by Deutsche Bank.â

Over the relevant period, the Deutsche Bank Yen LIBOR submitters regularly took into
account the oral or written requests by Deutsche Bank traders for beneficial Yen LIBOR
submissions. The submitters even openly solicited requests. Although the Yen Desk Manager
usually did not make Yen LIBOR submissions himself, he was aware of the open and pervasive
LIBOR requests being made by traders and the accommodation of those requests by the
submitters. On occasion, he received the tradersâ requests and agreed to pass them along to the
submitters to ensure that the submissions matched the tradersâ needs.

The submitters also consistently took their own trading positions into account when
making LIBOR submissions on behalf of the bank, even communicating with each other when
out of the office to ensure that the submissions were made in accordance with their trading
positions. They also coordinated with other MMD traders to ensure their respective trading
positions were not in conflict when making submissions to benefit those positions. As the Senior

 

* Although the Senior Yen Trader-Submitter formally reported to other supervisors, his daily MMD

reporting supervisor was the London MMD Manager throughout the relevant period; with respect to his
Yen LIBOR submission duties, he reported to the Yen Desk Manager.

23

 
Yen Trader-Submitter stated to another trader, âON JPY WE TRY TO HAVE OUT LIBORS
WITH OUR POSITIONS NOT AGAINSJT].â This practice of making Yen LIBOR submissions
to benefit the various tradersâ cash and derivatives trading positions persisted as responsibility
for making the submissions passed from Senior Yen LIBOR Submitter to Senior Yen Trader-
Submitter to, finally, in mid-2010, the Yen Desk Manager.

The following are examples of improper communications between Deutsche Bank Yen

LIBOR submitters and Yen traders:

June 27-28, 2006: (emphasis added)
senior Yen LIBOR Submitter:

Junior Yen LIBOR Submitter:

b. Deutsche Bankâs Coordination with the UBS Senior Yen Trader to
Manipulate Yen LIBOR

From mid-2008 through mid-2010, the Senior Yen Trader-Submitter coordinated with a
senior yen derivatives trader at a subsidiary of UBS AG (âUBS Senior Yen Traderâ) regarding
Yen LIBOR submissions.ââ> The Senior Yen Trader-Submitter communicated regularly with the
UBS Senior Yen Trader, discussing the market and their relative trading positions, and,
eventually, discussing beneficial Yen LIBOR submissions. The Senior Yen Trader-Submitter
knew the UBS Senior Yen Trader to be highly active and successful, one who provided liquidity
and movement to the Yen derivatives market. When the UBS Senior Yen Trader began to
request his assistance in making Deutsche Bankâs Yen LIBOR submissions in a manner to

 

* In the Commissionâs Order against UBS, Deutsche Bankâs Senior Yen Trader-Submitter is identified

in the Order as the Yen Bank F Trader-Submitter.

25

 
benefit his trading, the Senior Yen Trader-Submitter readily accommodated him. The Senior
Yen Trader-Submitter knew his control over the bankâs Yen LIBOR submissions enabled him to
make submissions to benefit his and the UBS Senior Yen Traderâs derivatives trading positions.
The UBS Senior Yen Trader also offered to assist the Deutsche Bank submitter by having his
submitters make submissions that would benefit the Senior Yen Trader-Submitter. The traders at
times aligned their trading positions so they could each equally benefit from the altered Yen
LIBOR submissions made by both banks.â

The following are examples of the coordination of their attempts to manipulate Yen
LIBOR:

August 28, 2008: (emphasis added)
UBS Senior Yen Trader: look i appreciate the business and the calls we
should try to share info where possible also
let me know if you need fixes one way or the

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other

Senior Yen Trader-Submitter: sure sorry mate have to go too busy on many
things

UBS Senior Yen Trader: and i'll do the same if you have any joy with
your setters

Senior Yen Trader-Submitter: no prob

September 1, 2008:

senior Yen Trader-Submitter: [.. .] but going to put high libors today

UBS Senior Yen Trader: sure i think you guys are top in 1m anyways

Senior Yen Trader-Submitter: iam mate need it high!

September 18, 2008: (emphasis added)

UBS Senior Yen Trader: you got any ax on 6m fix tonight?

Senior Yen Trader-Submitter: absoluetly none but ican help

UBS Senior Yen Trader: can you set low as a favour for me?

Senior Yen Trader-Submitter: done

UBS Senior Yen Trader: ill return favour whenican just ask have
75mm jpy abp tonight

Senior Yen Trader-Submitter: np

UBS Senior Yen Trader: thanks so much

Senior Yen Trader-Submitter: [...] 73/90/99 am putting libors

UBS Senior Yen Trader: ereat thanks mate

 

 

** When aligning their positions, they also often discussed Euroyen TIBOR, or the Tokyo Interbank

Offered Rate, a Tokyo-based rate similar to LIBOR. Some of their derivatives trading positions were tied
to this rate. Both Deutsche Bank and UBS were banks who made submissions for this rate. On a few
occasions, the Senior Yen Trader-Submitter and the UBS Senior Yen Trader discussed trying to have
their respective submitters alter their TIBOR submissions to benefit their trading positions. The Senior
Yen Trader-Submitter even attempted internally on a handful of occasions, once at the behest of the UBS
Senior Yen Trader, to contact the Deutsche Bank TIBOR submitter. He was unsuccessful in his attempts.

26

 
In a follow-up message the next day, the UBS Senior Yen Trader offered the Senior Yen
Trader-Submitter a deal, stating, âin fact cause you helped me on 6m yday.â

May 21, 2009: (emphasis added)

UBS Senior Yen Trader: cld you do me a favour would you mind
moving you 6m libor up a bit today, i have a
gigantic fix iam limit short can't sell
anymore just watch

 

 

 

 

 

Senior Yen Trader-Submitter: ican do that
UBS Senior Yen Trader: thx
Follow-up message the next day:
Senior Yen Trader-Submitter: u happy with me yesterday?
UBS Senior Yen Trader: thx i don't see it going up again today
Senior Yen Trader-Submitter: me too
UBS Senior Yen Trader: only you and [Yen Panel Bank A] moved

 

In the summer of 2009, the UBS Senior Yen Trader began extended campaigns to
manipulate the six-month tenor of Yen LIBOR to benefit massive trading positions he held tied
to one-, three-, and six-month Yen LIBOR. His plan first required moving the six-month Yen
LIBOR fixing higher by the fixing date at the end of June, and then, second, to keep it high
through July. Finally, he wanted the six-month Yen LIBOR fixing to drop dramatically by mid-
August. To assist him, the Deutsche Bank Senior Yen Trader-Submitter became an active and
necessary participant in his plan. The UBS Senior Yen Trader also offered to enter into trades at
rates detrimental to him but beneficial to the Senior Yen Trader-Submitter to ensure the Senior
Yen Trader-Submitterâs involvement in his plans and to entice him to make Deutsche Bankâs
Yen LIBOR submissions in the manner he desired. The Senior Yen Trader-Submitter readily
accepted those trades and made the submissions as requested by the UBS Senior Yen Trader; at
times, he would ask the next day whether the UBS Senior Yen Trader was pleased with his
efforts.

The following are examples of their specific coordination to manipulate Yen LIBOR over
the summer of 2009:

June 15, 2009:
UBS Senior Yen Trader: is there any chance you cld set a high 6m
tonight, just tonight, i have 1..5m usd bp fix no
worries if you can't god knows where that all

 

came from

Senior Yen Trader-Submitter: hum i think my libors will be unch for a while
now....my led is quite high andido not want
3m libor up

UBS Senior Yen Trader: me neither ineedlow3m no probustnd you

 

will help me out when 6m goes over the turn
tho? ihave 1m usd a bp that day too

The Senior Yen Trader-Submitter continued to coordinate with the UBS Senior Yen
Trader regarding beneficial Yen LIBOR submissions into mid-2010, even after the UBS Senior
Yen Trader left UBS for another Yen panel bank. At this point, however, the Senior Yen Trader-
Submitter was no longer responsible for Deutsche Bankâs Yen LIBOR submissions.

Accordingly, throughout the relevant period, Deutsche Bank routinely made false reports
regarding Yen LIBOR and attempted to manipulate Yen LIBOR in order to benefit Deutsche
Bankâs trading positions. As such, Deutsche Bankâs Yen LIBOR submissions were not made in
accordance with the BBA definitions and criteria for LIBOR submissions. At times, they were
successful in their attempted manipulations of Yen LIBOR.

7. Deutsche Bankâs False Reporting, Attempted Manipulation, and Manipulation of
Sterling LIBOR

During the relevant period, Deutsche Bank, through its submitters and traders, routinely
made false LIBOR submissions in furtherance of their attempts to manipulate Sterling LIBOR.
At times, they were successful in their attempts. The head of Deutsche Bankâs Sterling Pool
Trading desk in London (âSterling Desk Managerâ) and another trader assigned to the desk
(âSterling LIBOR Submitterâ). were responsible for submitting Deutsche Bankâs Sterling LIBOR
submissions. Both traders maintained the deskâs trading book which included proprietary
derivatives trading positions. The secondary Sterling trader, acting as the primary Sterling
LIBOR submitter, communicated regularly, often daily, with the Sterling Desk Manager
regarding the trading positions held in the Sterling Pool trading book.

Throughout the relevant period, Deutsche Bankâs Sterling Desk Manager and the Sterling
submitter routinely took their LIBOR-based trading positions into account when determining the
bankâs Sterling LIBOR submissions, and, accordingly, made false Sterling LIBOR contributions
routinely in order to benefit those positions, On occasion, the Sterling Desk Manager and
Sterling submitter received preferential requests from at least one Sterling MMD derivatives
trader which they, at times, accommodated when making Deutsche Bankâs LIBOR submissions.
Throughout the relevant period, Deutsche Bankâs Sterling LIBOR submissions were routinely
skewed in order to benefit the Deutsche Bankâs Sterling LIBOR derivatives trading positions.
The following are examples of communications between the Sterling Desk Manager and Sterling
submitter, and the requests from the Sterling MMD trader:

December 5, 2006: (to Sterling Desk Manager) (emphasis added)
Senior MMD Sterling Trader: HI MATE IF WE COULD GO FOR A 28

Accordingly, throughout the relevant period, Deutsche Bank routinely made false reports
regarding Sterling LIBOR in attempts to manipulate Sterling LIBOR in order to benefit Deutsche
Bankâs trading positions. As such, Deutsche Bankâs Sterling LIBOR submissions were not made
in accordance with the BBA definitions and criteria for LIBOR submissions. At times, they
were successful in their attempted manipulations of Sterling LIBOR.

8. Deutsche Bankâs False Reporting, Attempted Manipulation, and Manipulation
of Swiss Franc LIBOR

During the relevant period, Deutsche Bank, through its submitters and traders, routinely
made false submissions for Swiss Franc LIBOR in furtherance of its attempts to manipulate
Swiss Franc LIBOR. At times, they were successful in their attempts to manipulate Swiss Franc
LIBOR.

Deutsche Bankâs Swiss Franc LIBOR submissions were made by the Deutsche Bank
Non-Euro Pool Trading desk based in Frankfurt. The primary Swiss Franc LIBOR submitter

changed over the relevant period, one of whom was the Non-Euro Desk Manager.

Over the relevant period into 2010, one Swiss Franc Pool trader (Swiss Franc
Submitter 1) received from Deutsche Bank MMD derivatives traders in London, including the

32

 
Senior Yen Trader-Submitter, regular requests for preferential Swiss Franc LIBOR submissions
to benefit their derivatives trading positions. The Swiss Franc Submitter 1 routinely obliged
these trader requests and at times proactively reached out to the derivatives traders to ask
whether they had requests for that dayâs LIBOR submission. When the Swiss Franc Submitter |
was unavailable, the Non-Euro Desk Manager also adjusted Deutsche Bankâs Swiss Franc
LIBOR submissions to benefit the Senior Yen Trader-Submitter derivatives trading positions,

The Swiss Franc Submitter 1 was methodical in determining how submissions might
affect the Swiss Franc LIBOR submissions. During a telephone discussion between the Swiss
Franc Submitter 1 and the Senior Yen Trader-Submitter on August 19, 2009, the Swiss Franc
Submitter 1 explained that he maintained a spreadsheet in which he used a âLIBOR contribution
simulationâ to determine how a particular Deutsche Bank Swiss Franc LIBOR submission would
affect the Swiss Franc LIBOR fixing.

Examples of requests from the traders to the Swiss Franc Submitter 1 and the Non-Euro
Desk Manager are as follows:

March 26, 2007:
London MMD Swiss Franc Trader 1: hello sir, welcome back, you missed nothing,
not sure if matches with you but my int is for a

Later in mid-2010, the Swiss Franc Submitter 2 became responsible for Deutsche Bankâs
Swiss Franc LIBOR submissions. The Swiss Franc Submitter 2 often reached out to traders to
inform them of the bankâs intended Swiss Franc LIBOR submissions to determine whether there
any preferential rates needed by the derivatives traders. On occasion, the Swiss Franc
Submitter 2 received specific requests from MMD traders and skewed submissions to benefit
their trading positions. The Swiss Franc Submitter 2 continued this LIBOR. submission practice
until early 2011, more than a year after the start of the bankâs internal LIBOR investigation.
Examples of these communications are as follows:

September 9, 2010:

London MMD Swiss Franc Trader 2: Hi [Swiss Franc Submitter 2], good day to you.

Swiss Franc Submitter 2:

just to let you know if you can help..well or at
least dont kill on that one pls. Got quite big
fixings today: I am for: Lower fix in 1m higher
fix in 3m lower fix in6mtxs same tomorrow
in 6s3s and reverse monday...the beauty of
stupid mismatches

only helps you if relative to each other, right? 1
actually think a higher 3m fixing relative to 1m
and 6m would perfectly reflect market
movements today, should be no problem :-)

London MMD Swiss Franc Trader 2: i like your thinking! tks

34

 
Swiss Franc Submitter 2: won't have any effect though I'm just realizing.
my fixings are among the highest, they are not
counting into the average right now anyway

London MMD Swiss Franc Trader 2: haha, ok

Swiss Franc Submitter 2: sorry. I'm long :-)

 

 

September 22, 2010: (email to several Pool and MMD traders)
Swiss Franc Submitter 2: hi! libors unchanged today.

 

October 4, 2010:

London MMD Swiss Franc Trader 2: hello hello, so have u sorted when u coming
around? also, we re not the highest in fixings
anymore, do you think you could increase your
3m slightly from tomorrow on if suits
obviously.,,.bloody cs moved lower today and 1
m paid for the next 3 weeks or so

April 18, 2011: (email to several Pool and MMD traders)
Swiss Franc Submitter 2: hihi, chf libors unchanged please.

 

Accordingly, throughout the relevant period, Deutsche Bank routinely made false reports
regarding Swiss Franc LIBOR in attempts to manipulate Swiss Franc LIBOR in order to benefit
Deutsche Bankâs trading positions. As such, Deutsche Bankâs Swiss Franc LIBOR submissions
were not made in accordance with the BBA definitions and criteria for LIBOR submissions. At
times, they were successful in their attempted manipulations of Swiss Franc LIBOR.

ORR a oo a oe

As described above, Deutsche Bank made repeated and regular attempts to manipulate
U.S. Dollar, Yen, Sterling, and Swiss Franc LIBOR and Euribor in order to affect the official
fixings of LIBOR and Euribor in a manner that would benefit its cash and derivatives trading
positions. Deutsche Bank, through its derivatives traders and submitters, knew it was improper
to consider derivatives trading positions in determining the bankâs LIBOR and Euribor
submissions, A bankâs derivatives trading positions are not legitimate or permissible factors on
which to base a bankâs daily LIBOR or Euribor submissions. By basing its LIBOR and Euribor
submissions on rates that benefited Deutsche Bankâs derivatives trading positions, Deutsche
Bankâs submissions were not made in accordance with the definitions and criteria for LIBOR
and Euribor submissions. Instead, Deutsche Bank knowingly conveyed false, misleading, or
knowingly inaccurate reports that its submitted rates for LIBOR and Euribor were based on and
solely reflected its assessment of the costs of borrowing unsecured funds in the relevant
interbank money markets. Accordingly, Deutsche Bank regularly attempted to manipulate the
official fixings for U.S. Dollar, Yen, Sterling, and Swiss Franc LIBOR and Euribor, and
knowingly delivered false, misleading, or knowingly inaccurate reports concerning U.S. Dollar,
Yen, Sterling, and Swiss Franc LIBOR and Euribor, which are commodities in interstate
commerce.

IV.
LEGAL DISCUSSION

A. Deutsche Bank Made False, Misleading, or Knowingly Inaccurate Reports
Concerning the Costs of Borrowing Unsecured Funds in Violation of Section 9(a){2)
of the Act

Section 9(a)(2) of the Act makes it unlawful for any person âknowingly to deliver or
cause to be delivered for transmission through the mails or interstate commerce by telegraph,
telephone, wireless, or other means of communication false or misleading or knowingly
inaccurate reports concerning crop or market information or conditions that affect or tend to
affect the price of any commodity.in interstate commerce... .â 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13(a)(2) (2006);

On a daily basis, Deutsche Bank knowingly delivered or caused to be delivered its U.S.
Dollar, Yen, Sterling, and Swiss Franc LIBOR and Euribor submissions through the mails or
interstate commerce by transmitting its submissions electronically to the service provider of the
BBA and EBF, who calculates their official fixings (7.e., Thomson Reuters), Deutsche Bankâs
submissions were also caused to be delivered through the mails or interstate commerce through
the daily dissemination and publication globally, including into the United States, of the panel
banksâ submissions, as well as the daily official benchmark interest rates, by at least Thomson
Reuters on behalf of the BBA and EBF, and by other third party vendors. The panel banksâ
submissions are used to determine the official published rates for LIBOR and Euribor, which are
calculated based on a trimmed average of the submissions. Deutsche Bankâs daily LIBOR and
Euribor submissions contained market information concerning the costs of borrowing unsecured
funds in particular currencies and tenors, the liquidity conditions and stress in the money
markets, and Deutsche Bankâs ability to borrow funds in the particular markets, Such market
information affects or tends to affect the prices of commodities in interstate commerce, including
the daily rates at which U.S. Dollar, Yen, Sterling, and Swiss Franc LIBOR and Euribor are
fixed,

During the relevant period, Deutsche Bankâs submissions for U.S. Dollar, Yen, Sterling,
and Swiss Franc LIBOR and Euribor were false, misleading, or knowingly inaccurate because
they were based in whole or in part on impermissible and illegitimate factors, specifically
Deutsche Bankâs cash and derivatives trading positions. By using these impermissible and
illegitimate factors in making its LIBOR and Euribor submissions, Deutsche Bank conveyed
false, misleading, or knowingly inaccurate information that the rates it submitted were based on
and related solely to the costs of borrowing unsecured funds in the relevant interbank markets,
and were truthful and reliable. Moreover, certain of Deutsche Bankâs traders, submitters, and

 

*5 LIBOR and Euribor as benchmark interest rates are commodities under the Act. See Sections 1a(4)

and 1a(13) of the Act, 7 U.S.C, Â§Â§ 1a(4) and 1a(13) (2006) (pre-Dodd Frank) and Sections 1a(9) and
la(19) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1a(9) and La(19) (2012) (post-Dodd Frank).

managers, including a senior manager, knew that Deutsche Bankâs U.S. Dollar, Yen, Sterling,
and Swiss Franc LIBOR and Euribor submissions contained false, misleading and knowingly
inaccurate information concerning the submitted rates. By such conduct, Respondent violated
Section 9(a)(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13(a)(2) (2006).

B. Deutsche Bank Manipulated U.S. Dollar LIBOR, Euribor, Yen LIBOR, Sterling
LIBOR, and Swiss France LIBOR at Times for Certain Tenors

Together, Sections 6(c), 6(d), and 9(a)(2) of the Act prohibit acts of manipulation or
attempted manipulation. Section 9(a)(2) of the Act makes it unlawful for â[a]ny person to
manipulate or attempt to manipulate the price of any commodity in interstate commerce, or for
future delivery on or subject to the rules of any registered entity... .â 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13(a)(2)
(2006). Section 6(c) of the Act authorizes the Commission to serve a complaint and provide for
the imposition of, among other things, civil monetary penalties and cease and desist orders if the
Commission âhas reason to believe that any person... is manipulating or attempting to
manipulate or has manipulated or attempted to manipulate the market price of any commodity, in
interstate commerce, or for future delivery on or subject to the rules of any registered entity, . . .
or otherwise is violating or has violated any of the provisions of [the] Act... .â 7 U.S.C. Â§9
(2006). Section 6(d) of the Act is substantially identical to Section 6(c). See 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13b
(2006).

Manipulation under the Act is the âintentional exaction of a price determined by forces
other than supply or demand.â Frey v. CFTC, 931 F.2d 1171, 1175 (7th Cir. 1991), The
following four elements must be met, by a preponderance of the evidence, to show a successful
manipulation has occurred:

(1) the [respondent] had the ability to influence market prices;
(2) the [respondent] specifically intended to do so;

(3) artificial prices existed; and

(4) the [respondent] caused an artificial price.

Inre Cox, [1986-1987 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L, Rep, (CCH) 4 23,786, at 34,061
(CFTC July 15, 1987). The test for manipulation, however, is a practical one:

We think the test of manipulation must largely be a practical one if the
purposes of the Commodity Exchange Act are to be accomplished. The
methods and techniques of manipulation are limited only the ingenuity of
man. The aim must be therefore to discover whether conduct has been
intentionally engaged in which has resulted in a price which does not
reflect basic forces of supply and demand.

Cargill v. Hardin, 452 F.2d 1154, 1163 (8th Cir. 1971).
ââ[I|ntent is the essence of manipulation.â Indiana Farm Bureau Cooperative Assân, Inc.,

[1982-1984 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep (CCH) 4 21,796, at 27,282 (CFTC Dec. 17,
1982). The manipulatorâs intent separates âlawful business conduct from unlawful manipulative

37

 
activity.â /d. at 27,283. To prove the intent element of manipulation, it must be shown that
Deutsche Bank âacted (or failed to act) with the purpose or conscious object of causing or
effecting a price or price trend in the market that did not reflect the legitimate forces of supply
and demand.â Id.

The Commission has observed that âintent must of necessity be inferred from the
objective facts and may, of course, be inferred by a personâs actions and the totality of the
circumstances.â Jn re Hohenberg Bros., [1975-1977 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep.
(CCH) 4 20,271, at 21,477 (CFTC Feb. 18, 1977). â[O]nce it is demonstrated that the alleged
manipulator sought, by act or omission, to move the market away from the equilibrium or
efficient price â the price which reflects market forces of supply and demand â the mental
element of manipulation may be inferred.â Indiana Farm Bureau Cooperative Assân, Inc.,
[1982-1984 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep (CCH) at 27,283. âIt is enough to present
evidence from which it may reasonably be inferred that the accused âconsciously desire[d] that
result, whatever the likelihood of that result happening from his conduct.ââ Jd. (quoting United
States yv. United States Gypsum Co., 438 U.S. 442, 445 (1978)). A profit motive may also be
evidence of intent, although profit motive is not a necessary element of an attempted
manipulation. See In re DiPlacido, [2007-2009 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) 4
30,970, at 62,484 (CFTC Nov. 5, 2008) (citing In re Hohenberg Bros, Co., Comm. Fut. L. Rep.
(CCH) { 20,271, at 21,478)), aff'd, 364 Fed. Appx. 657, No. 08-5559-ag, 2009 WL 3326624 (2d
Cir, 2009),

An artificial price (also termed a âdistortedâ price) is one âthat does not reflect market or
economic forces of supply and demand.â Jn re Cox, [1986-1987 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L.
Rep. (CCH) at 34,064; Indiana Farm Bureau Cooperative Ass'n, Inc., [1982-1984 Transfer
Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep (CCH) at 27,288 n. 2. As the Commission noted with approval in
DiPlacido, { 30,970, at 62,484 (quoting Indiana Farm Bureau Cooperative Ass'n, Inc., [1982-
1984 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep (CCH) at 27,300 (Commissioner Stone concutring)),
a Commissioner has commented: â[t]his is more an axiom than a test.â In determining whether
an artificial price has occurred:

[O|ne must look at the aggregate forces of supply and demand and search
for those factors which are extraneous to the pricing system, are not a
legitimate part of the economic pricing of the commodity, or are extrinsic
to that commodity market. When the aggregate forces of supply and
demand bearing down on a particular market are all legitimate, it follows
that the price will not be artificial. On the other hand when a price is
effected by a factor which is not legitimate, the resulting price is
necessarily artificial. Thus, the focus should not be as much on the
ultimate price as on the nature of the factors causing it.

Indiana Farm Bureau Cooperative Assân, Inc., [1982-1984 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep
(CCH) at 27,288 n.2. See also In re DiPlacido, [2007-2009 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L.
Rep. (CCH) at 62,484 (finding that the placement of uneconomic bids or offers results in
artificial prices because those prices are not determined by the free forces of supply and demand
on the exchange).

38

 
Causation of artificial prices is established when it is demonstrated that artificial market
prices resulted from the conduct of a trader, or group of traders acting in concert, rather than
legitimate forces of supply and demand. See Cargill, Inc. v. Hardin, 452 F.2d 1154, 1171-72
(8th Cir. 1971) (price squeeze âintentionally brought about and exploited by Cargillâ); In re Cox,
[1986-1987 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) at 34,067 (proof of causation requires
the Division to show that âthe respondentsâ conduct âresulted inâ artificial pricesâ).

There can be multiple causes of an artificial price. In re DiPlacido, [2007-2009 Transfer
Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) at 62,485. The manipulatorâs actions need not be the sole
cause of the artificial price. âIt is enough for purposes of a finding of manipulation in violation
of Sections 6(b) and 9 of the Act that respondentsâ action contributed to the price [movement].â
In re Kosuga, 19 A.D. 603, 624 (1960); see also In re Cox, [1986-1987 Transfer Binder] Comm,
Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) at 34,066 (recognizing there can be multiple causes of an artificial price and
holding that a charge of manipulation can be sustained where respondentsâ acts are a proximate
cause of the artificial price).

Here, as a member of the BBAâs U.S. Dollar, Yen, Sterling, and Swiss Franc LIBOR
panels and the Euribor panel, Deutsche Bank made daily submissions that purported to reflect its
assessments of the costs of borrowing unsecured funds in the relevant interbank markets for U.S.
Dollar, Yen, Sterling, Swiss Franc, and Euro across tenors. The official LIBOR and Euribor
fixings are calculated using a trimmed average methodology applied to the rates submitted by the
panel banks. By virtue of this methodology, Deutsche Bank had the ability to influence or affect
the rates that would become the official fixings for U.S. Dollar, Yen, Sterling, and Swiss Franc
LIBOR and Euribor for any tenor.

As evidenced by the extensive communications and other facts set forth above, in making
the false LIBOR and Euribor submissions, more than two dozen Deutsche Bank traders,
submitters, and managers specifically intended to affect the daily U.S. Dollar, Yen, Sterling, and
Swiss Franc LIBOR and Euribor for certain tenors, including one-month, three-month, and six-
month. Their intent is also made clear by the evidence that the derivatives traders and
submittersâ motives were to benefit Deutsche Bankâs derivatives and at times cash trading
positions, or, at times, the derivatives trading positions of other panel banks with whom certain
Deutsche Bank derivatives traders coordinated.

On certain occasions, Deutsche Bankâs false, misleading, or knowingly inaccurate
LIBOR and Euribor submissions were illegitimate factors in the pricing of the daily LIBOR and
Euribor fixings and affected the official LIBOR and Euribor for certain tenors, resulting in
artificial LIBOR and Euribor fixings. Thus, Deutsche Bankâs actions were a proximate cause of
the artificial LIBOR and Euribor fixings.

Accordingly, at times, Deutsche Bank manipulated certain tenors of U.S. Dollar, Yen,
Sterling, and Swiss Franc LIBOR and Euribor, commodities in interstate commerce, in violation
of Sections 6(c), 6(d), and 9(a)(2) of the Act.

39

 
C. Deutsche Bank Attempted to Manipulate U.S. Dollar, Yen, Sterling, and Swiss
Franc LIBOR and Euribor

To prove attempted manipulation, two elements are required: (1) an intent to affect the
market price; and (2) an overt act in furtherance of that intent. See Jn re Hohenberg Bros. Co.,
[1975-77 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) 4 20,271, at 21,477 (CFTC Feb. 18,
1977); CFTC y. Bradley, 408 F. Supp. 2d 1214, 1220 (N.D. Okla. 2005). The intent standard is
the same as that for manipulation. See Indiana Farm Bureau and Hohenberg Bros., supra.

As found above, more than two dozen Deutsche Bank derivatives traders, submitters, and
managers specifically intended to affect the rate at which the daily LIBOR for U.S. Dollar, Yen,
Sterling, and Swiss Franc and the daily Euribor would be fixed to benefit Deutsche Bankâs
derivatives trading and, at times, money market positions, or, in the case of Euribor and Yen
LIBOR, to benefit the derivatives trading positions of traders at other banks with whom certain
Deutsche Bank traders coordinated. The Deutsche Bank derivatives tradersâ requests for
beneficial LIBOR and Euribor submissions and the Deutsche Bank submitters making
submissions based on those requests, or making submissions to benefit their own derivatives
trading positions, constitute overt acts in furtherance of their intent to affect the fixings of
LIBOR for various currencies and the fixings of Euribor. By doing so, Deutsche Bank engaged
in repeated acts of attempted manipulation in violation of Sections 6(c), 6(d), and 9(a)(2) of the
Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 9, 13b, and 13(a)(2) (2006).

D. Deutsche Bank Aided and Abetted the Attempts of Traders at Other Banks to
Manipulate Yen LIBOR and Euribor

Pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Act, Deutsche Bank aided and abetted the attempts of
traders at other banks to manipulate Yen LIBOR and Euribor in violation of the Act. 7 U.S.C,
Â§ 13c(a) (2006), Liability as an aider and abettor requires proof that: (1) the Act was violated;
(2) the aider and abettor had knowledge of the wrongdoing underlying the violation; and (3) the
aider and abettor intentionally assisted the primary wrongdoer. See In re Nikkhah, [1999-2000
Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) f 28,129, at 49,888 n.28 (CFTC May 12, 2000).
Although actual knowledge of the primary wrongdoerâs conduct is required, knowledge of the
unlawfulness of such conduct need not be demonstrated. See Jn re Lincolnwood Commodities,
Inc., [1982-1984 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) 4 21,986, at 28,255 (CFTC Jan.
31, 1984). Knowing assistance can be inferred from the surrounding facts and circumstances.
Id.

As evidenced by the communications set forth above, Deutsche Bankâs Senior Yen
Trader-Submitter and London MMD Manager and derivatives traders at other panel banks
coordinated on several occasions about Yen LIBOR and Euribor submissions that would benefit
their banksâ respective cash and derivatives trading positions. At times, the traders at the other
panel banks asked Deutsche Bank traders to submit a certain rate, or submit a rate in a direction
higher or lower, that would benefit the cash and derivatives trading positions of the traders at the
other panel banks. The Deutsche Bank Senior Yen Trader-Submitter agreed and submitted the
requested preferential rates for Yen LIBOR. The London MMD Manager also agreed and
passed along the requested Euribor submissions to Deutsche Bankâs Euribor submitters, who

40

 
accommodated the requests. Accordingly, by seeking to affect the rates at which Yen LIBOR
and Euribor were fixed, traders at the other banks attempted to manipulate Yen LIBOR and
Euribor in violation of Sections 6(c), 6(d), and 9(a)(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 9, 13b, and
13(a)(2) (2006). Deutsche Bankâs Senior Yen Trader-Submitter and London MMD Manager
had knowledge of and intentionally assisted the attempts of the traders at the other banks to
manipulate the rates at which Yen LIBOR and Euribor were fixed. By such acts of those
Deutsche Bank employees, Deutsche Bank aided and abetted the attempts of traders at other
banks to manipulate Yen LIBOR and Euribor in violation of Sections 6(c), 6(d), and 9(a)(2) of
the Act, 7 U.S.C, Â§Â§ 9, 13b, and 13(a)(2) (2006),

KE. Deutsche Bank is Liable for the Acts of Its Agents

Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(a)(1)(B), and Regulation 1.2, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.2
(2012), provide that the act, omission, or failure of any official, agent, or other person acting for
any individual, association, partnership, corporation, or trust within the scope of his employment
or office shall be deemed the act, omission, or failure of such individual, association, partnership,
corporation, or trust. Pursuant to Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the CEA and Commission Regulation
1,2, strict liability is imposed on principals for the actions of their agents. See, e.g., Rosenthal &
Co. v. CFTC, 802 F.2d 963, 966 (7th Cir. 1986); Dohmen-Ramirez & Wellington Advisory, Inc.
v. CFTC, 837 F.2d 847, 857-58 (9th Cir, 1988).

Deutsche Bank is liable for the acts, omissions, and failures of the traders, managers, and
submitters who acted as its employees and/or agents in the conduct described above and
accordingly, violated Sections 6(c), 6(d), and 9(a)(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 9, 13b, and 13(a)(2)
(2006), as set forth above.

V.

under Rule 506(d)(1) of the Regulation D exemption should not arise as a consequence of
this Order.

D. Respondent and its successors and assigns shall comply with the following conditions
and undertakings set forth in the Offer, Respondent represents that it has already
undertaken and implemented, or is implementing certain compliance and supervisory
controls or enhancements consistent with these Undertakings:

1. PRINCIPLES?â

i. Respondent agrees to undertake the following: (1) to ensure the integrity
and reliability of its Benchmark Interest Rate Submission(s), presently and
in the future; and (2) to identify, construct and promote effective
methodologies and processes of setting Benchmark Interest Rates, in
coordination with efforts by Benchmark Publishers, in order to ensure the
integrity and reliability of Benchmark Interest Rates in the future.

ii. Respondent represents and undertakes that each Benchmark Interest Rate
Submission by Respondent shall be based upon a rigorous and honest
assessment of information, and shall not be influenced by internal or
external conflicts of interest, or other factors or information extraneous to
any rules applicable to the setting of a Benchmark Interest Rate.

 

*7 The following terms are defined as follows:

Benchmark Interest Rate: An interest rate for a currency and maturity/tenor that is calculated
based on data received from market participants and published to the market on a regular,
periodic basis, such as LIBOR and Euribor;

Benchmark Publisher: A banking association or other entity that is responsible for or oversees
the calculation and publication of a Benchmark Interest Rate;

Submission(s): The interest rate(s) submitted for each currency and maturity/tenor to a
Benchmark Publisher, For example, if Respondent submits a rate for one-month and three-month
U.S. Dollar LIBOR, that would constitute two Submissions;

Submitter(s): The person(s) responsible for determining and/or transmitting the Submission(s);
and

Supervisor(s): The person(s) immediately and directly responsible for supervising any portion of
the process of Submission(s) and/or any of the Submitter(s).

44

 
2. INTEGRITY AND RELIABILITY OF BENCHMARK INTEREST RATE
SUBMISSIONS

i. DETERMINATION OF SUBMISSIONS: Respondent shall determine its
Submission(s) based on the following Factors, Adjustments and
Considerations, unless otherwise prohibited by or contrary to an
affirmative obligation imposed by any law or regulation, or the rules or
definitions issued by a Benchmark Publisher. Respondentâs transactions
shall be given the greatest weight in determining its Submissions, subject
to applying appropriate Adjustments and Considerations in order to reflect
the market measured by the Benchmark Interest Rate.âÂ°

Respondent shall determine its Submissions as described in these
Undertakings within fourteen (14) days of the entry of this Order.

" Factor 1 â Respondentâs Borrowing or Lending Transactions
Observed by Respondentâs Submitters:

a. Respondentâs transactions in the market as defined by the
Benchmark Publisher for the particular Benchmark Interest
Rate;

b. Respondentâs transactions in other markets for unsecured
funds, including, but not limited to, certificates of deposit
and issuances of commercial paper; and

c. Respondentâs transactions in various related markets,
including, but not limited to, Overnight Index Swaps,
foreign currency forwards, repurchase agreements, futures,
and Fed Funds.

e Factor 2 â Third Party Transactions Observed by Respondentâs
Submitters:

a. Transactions in the market as defined by the Benchmark
Interest Rate relevant to cach of the Submission(s);

b. Transactions in other markets for unsecured funds,
including, but not limited to, certificates of deposit and
issuances of commercial paper; and

 

*8 The rules used by Benchmark Publishers to determine Benchmark Interest Rates vary, may not be

consistent with each other, and provide different levels of guidance as to how to make Submissions.

4S

 
c. Transactions in various related markets, including, but not
limited to, Overnight Index Swaps, foreign currency
forwards, repurchase agreements, futures, and Fed Funds.

Â» Factor 3 â Third Party Offers Observed by Respondentâs
Submitters:

a. Third party offers to Respondent in the market as defined
by the Benchmark Publisher relevant to each of the
Submission(s);

issuances of commercial paper, provided to Respondent by
interdealer brokers (e.g., voice brokers); and

c. Third party offers provided to Respondent in various
related markets, including, but not limited to, Overnight
Index Swaps, foreign currency forwards, repurchase
agreements, and Fed Funds.

x Adjustments and Considerations: All of the following
Adjustments and Considerations may be applied with respect to
each of the Factors above:

a. Time: With respect to the Factors considered above,
proximity in time to the Submission(s) increases the
relevance of that Factor;

b. Market Events: Respondent may adjust its Submission(s)
based upon market events, including price variations in
related markets, that occur prior to the time at which the
Submission(s) must be made to the Benchmark Publisher.
That adjustment shall reflect measurable effects on
transacted rates, offers or bids;

c. Term Structure: As Respondent applies the above Factors,
if Respondent has data for any maturity/tenor described by
a Factor, then Respondent may interpolate or extrapolate
the remaining maturities/tenors from the available data;

IV.

Additionally, Respondent may take into account
counterpartiesâ credit standings, access to funds, and
borrowing or lending requirements, and third party offers
considered in connection with the above Factors; and

e. Non-representative Transactions: To the extent a
transaction included among the Factors above significantly
diverges in an objective manner from other transactions,
and that divergence is not due to market events as
addressed above, Respondent may exclude such
transactions from the determination of its Submission(s).

SUPERVISOR(S) REVIEW: Effective within fourteen (14) days of the
entry of this Order, each daily Submission shall be reviewed by a
Supervisor on a daily basis after the Submission(s) are made to the
Benchmark Publisher.

QUALIFICATIONS OF SUBMITTER(S) AND SUPERVISOR(S): All

 

Submitter(s) shall have significant experience in the markets for the
Benchmark Interest Rate to which they are submitting or a comparable
market, but may designate less experienced parties, who routinely work

absence. All Supervisors shall have significant experience in the markets
for the relevant Benchmark Interest Rate or a comparable market.
Submitters, Supervisors and any parties designated to make Submission(s)
when the Submitter(s) are absent shall not be assigned to any derivatives
trading desk, unit or division within Respondent, or participate in

Publisherâs rules or definitions, or Section 2 of these Undertakings;
and

greatest weight or considered to be the most relevant, and
the basis for such conclusion;

Respondentâs Submission(s), such as models for credit
standards and/or term structure, and any adjustments made

Respondent in connection with determining its
Submission(s), including, without limitation, the following:

54

 
3. DEVELOPMENT OF RIGOROUS STANDARDS FOR BENCHMARK
INTEREST RATES

To the extent Respondent is or remains a contributor to any Benchmark Interest
Rate, Respondent agrees to make its best efforts to participate in efforts by current
and future Benchmark Publishers, other price reporting entities and/or regulators
to ensure the reliability of Benchmark Interest Rates, and through its participation
to encourage the following:

1.

ii,

iil.

iv.

METHODOLOGY: Creating rigorous methodologies for the contributing
panel members to formulate their Submissions. The aim of such
methodologies should be to result in a Benchmark Interest Rate that
accurately reflects the rates at which transactions are occurring in the
market being measured by that Benchmark Interest Rate;

 

VERIFICATION: Enforcing the use of those methodologies through an
effective regime of documentation, monitoring, supervision and auditing,
required by and performed by the Benchmark Publishers, and by the
contributing panel members internally;

INVESTIGATION: Facilitating the reporting of complaints and concerns
regarding the accuracy or integrity of Submissions to Benchmark Interest
Rates or the published Benchmark Interest Rate, and investigating those
complaints and concerns thoroughly;

 

DISCIPLINE: Taking appropriate action if, following a thorough
confidential investigation, the Benchmark Publisher determines that a
complaint or concern regarding the accuracy or integrity of a Submission
or the published Benchmark Interest Rate has been substantiated;

TRANSPARENCY: Making regular reports to the public and the markets
of facts relevant to the integrity and reliability of each Benchmark Interest
Rate. Such reports should include, but not be limited to, the following:

 

x At the time each Benchmark Interest Rate is published, the
Benchmark Publisher should display prominently whether each
rate is based entirely on transactions in the market the rate is
supposed to reflect, or whether it instead is based, in whole or in
part, on other data or information;

# The Benchmark Publisher also should make periodic reports
regarding the number and nature of complaints and concerns
received regarding the accuracy or integrity of Submissions or the
published Benchmark Interest Rate while maintaining the
anonymity of all those who have reported or are the subject of
complaints and concerns;

55

 
V1.

# The Benchmark Publisher should additionally make periodic
reports regarding the results of all investigations into such
complaints and concerns while maintaining the anonymity of all
those involved in investigations that have not yet been completed;
and

FORMULATION: Periodically examining whether each Benchmark
Interest Rate accurately reflects the rate at which transactions are
occuring in the market being measured (using the statistical method
prescribed by that Benchmark Interest Rate), and evaluating whether the
definition and instructions should be revised, or the composition of the
panel changed;

Such examinations should include a rigorous mathematical comparison of
transactions in the relevant market with the published Benchmark Interest
Rate on the same day over a specified period and a determination of
whether any differences are statistically or commercially significant.

Every four (4) months, starting 120 days from the entry of this Order, Respondent
shall report to the Commission, through the Division, either orally or in writing,
on its participation in such efforts, to the extent that such reporting is not
otherwise prohibited by law or regulations, by the rules issued by Benchmark
Publishers, or by nondisclosure agreements by and between Respondent and
Benchmark Publishers.

4, COOPERATION WITH THE COMMISSION

i,

Respondent shall cooperate fully and expeditiously with the Commission,
including the Division, and any other governmental agency in this action,
and in any investigation, civil litigation or administrative matter related to
the subject matter of this action or any current or future Commission
investigation related thereto. As part of such cooperation, Respondent
agrees to the following for a period of five (5) years from the date of the
entry of this Order, or until all related investigations and litigation are
concluded, including through the appellate review process, whichever
period is longer:

# Preserve all records relating to the subject matter of this
proceeding, including, but not limited to, audio files, electronic
mail, other documented communications, and trading records;

s Subject to applicable laws and regulations, comply fully, promptly,

completely, and truthfully with all inquiries and requests for
information or documents;

56

 
= Provide authentication of documents and other evidentiary
material;

a Subject to applicable laws and regulations, provide copies of
documents within Respondentâs possession, custody or control;

a Subject to applicable laws and regulations, Respondent will make
its best efforts to produce any current (as of the time of the request)
officer, director, employee, or agent of Respondent, regardless of
the individualâs location, and at such location that minimizes
Commission travel expenditures, to provide assistance at any trial,
proceeding, or Commission investigation related to the subject
matter of this proceeding, including, but not limited to, requests for
testimony, depositions, and/or interviews, and to encourage them
to testify completely and truthfully in any such proceeding, trial, or
investigation; and

# Subject to applicable laws and regulations, Respondent will make
its best efforts to assist in locating and contacting any prior (as of
the time of the request) officer, director, employee, or agent of
Respondent;

ii. Respondent also agrees that it will not undertake any act, other than as
required by applicable law, which would limit its ability to cooperate fully
with the Commission. Respondent will designate an agent located in the
United States of America to receive all requests for information pursuant
to these Undertakings, and shall provide notice regarding the identity of
such Agent to the Division upon entry of this Order. Should Respondent
seek to change the designated agent to receive such requests, notice of
such intention shall be given to the Division fourteen (14) days before it
occurs. Any person designated to receive such request shall be located in
the United States of America; and

ill. Respondent and the Commission agree that nothing in these Undertakings
shall be construed so as to compel Respondent to continue to contribute
Submission(s) related to any Benchmark Interest Rate. Without prior
consultation with the Commission, Respondent remains free to withdraw
from the panel of contributors to any Benchmark Interest Rate.

5. PROHIBITED OR CONFLICTING UNDERTAKINGS

Should the Undertakings herein be prohibited by, or be contrary to the provisions
of any obligations imposed on Respondent by any presently existing, or
hereinafter enacted or promulgated laws, regulations, regulatory mandates, or the
rules or definitions issued by a Benchmark Publisher, then Respondent shall
promptly transmit notice to the Commission (through the Division) of such

37

 
prohibition or conflict, and shall meet and confer in good faith with the
Commission (through the Division) to reach an agreement regarding possible
modifications to the Undertakings herein sufficient to resolve such inconsistent
obligations. In the interim, Respondent will abide by the obligations imposed by
the law, regulations, regulatory mandates and Benchmark Publishersâ rules and
definitions. Nothing in these Undertakings shall limit, restrict or narrow any
obligations pursuant to the Act or the Commission Regulations promulgated
thereunder, including but not limited to Regulations 1.31 and 1.35, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§
1.31 and 1.35 (2014), in effect now or in the future.

6. PUBLIC STATEMENTS

Respondent agrees that neither it nor any of its successors and assigns, agents or
employees under its authority or control shall take any action or make any public
statement denying, directly or indirectly, any findings or conclusions in this Order
or creating, or tending to create, the impression that this Order is without a factual
basis; provided, however, that nothing in this provision shall affect Respondentâs
(i) testimonial obligations, or (i1) right to take legal positions in other proceedings
to which the Commission is not a party. Respondent and its successors and
assigns shall undertake all steps necessary to ensure that all of its agents and/or
employees under its authority or control understand and comply with this
agreement.

E, Partial Satisfaction: Respondent understands and agrees that any acceptance by the
Commission of partial payment of Respondentâs CMP Obligation shall not be deemed a
waiver of its obligation to make further payments pursuant to this Order, or a waiver of
the Commissionâs right to seek to compel payment of any remaining balance.

The provisions of this Order shall be effective as of this date.

By the Commission.
