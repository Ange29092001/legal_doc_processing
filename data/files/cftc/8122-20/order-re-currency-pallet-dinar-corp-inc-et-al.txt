This order presumes familiarity with this caseâs underlying facts, which were
established during a bench trial held on August 12, 2019 and outlined in detail in the
Courtâs Memorandum Opinion with Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law. (Doc.
227). This matter comes before the court on two issues.

First, immediately before the bench trial, Plaintiff Commodity Futures
Trading Commission filed its First Motion in Limine for Court to Draw an Adverse
Inference from Defendantsâ Failure to Produce Business Records and to Exclude

Speculative or Irrelevant Testimony, Evidence, or Arguments Related to Purported

Deductions from Disgorgement for Defendantsâ Costs or Expenses. (Doc. 203).
Because the Memorandum Opinion grants the CFTCâs requested disgorgement for
the reasons stated therein, the motion is denied as MOOT.

Second, the Court is in receipt of the CFTCâs post-trial status report and
Tayehâs response. After the bench trial, the CFTC notified the Court that the asset
freeze will need to be lifted and the approximately $2,500,000 in foreign currency
held in Mobile by the FBI released. (Doc. 220). Tayeh argues that, per the Stipulation
for Compromise Settlement and Amended Order and Decree of Forfeiture, the
money has already been released and that the CFTC waived any claim to stopping
release of the money. (Doc. 221). The CFTC responds that the underlying criminal
case resolved only that the money would not be subject to forfeiture as part of the
criminal case. (Doc. 222).

Specific to this dispute is the Stipulation for Compromise Settlement in a
related criminal case. Paragraph five states, ââThe United States agrees not to initiate
or pursue judicial forfeiture proceedings against the Dinar and Dong foreign
currency currently held by the Federal Bureau of Investigation as evidence in
connection with case 1:l6cr213-WKW.â United States v. One Parcel of Property,
Case No. 1:16-cv-831-SRW, at Doc. 29-1 95 (M.D. Ala. May 18, 2017); One Parcel
of Property, Case No. 1:16-cv-831, at Doc. 40 (M.D. Ala. Nov. 7, 2017) (approving

stipulation).

Tayeh claims that the money has already been released, but the fact that he
does not have it indicates otherwise. There is no allegation that the United States has
not complied with its settlhement agreement in not pursuing forfeiture of the foreign
currency. And Tayehâs attempts to equivalate forfeiture and offsetting is unavailing.
Forfeiture is a remedy, and offsetting is a common law right which âpermits a person
âto apply the unappropriated moneys of his debtor, in his hands, in extinguishment
of the debts due him.ââ Ind. Bank, N.A. v. United States, 583 F. Supp. 2d 44, 50
(D.D.C. 2008) (quoting United States v. Munsey Trust Co., 332 U.S. 234, 239
(1947)). In this regard, the federal government enjoys the same right of set-off as
any other creditor. /d. (permitting United States to offset companyâs tax debt against
funds held by Treasury Department to which separate plaintiff claimed greater
interest). It is ORDERED that the pallet of currency held in Mobile by the FBI in
connection with Tayeh shall be released to the CFTC as an offset against the final
judgment entered in this case.

DONE and ORDERED this 14th day of February 2020.
