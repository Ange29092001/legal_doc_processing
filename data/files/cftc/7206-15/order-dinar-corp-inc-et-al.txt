SEALED ORDER GRANTING COMMISSIONâS EX PARTE STATUTORY
RESTRAINING ORDER

Plaintiff, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ), has filed a
Complaint for Permanent Injunction and Other Relief, and has moved, pursuant to Section
6c(a) of the Commodity Exchange Act (the âActâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(a) (2012) and Federal
Rule of Civil Procedure (âFed. R. Civ. P.â) 65(b), for an in camera, ex parte statutory
restraining order enjoining Defendants Dinar Corp, Inc. (âDCTâ), My Monex, Inc., a Nevada
corporation (âMonex NVâ) and Husam Tayeh (âTayehâ) (collectively the âDefendantsâ) and
Relief Defendants Theodore S. Hudson, II (âHudsonâ) and My Monex, Inc., an Alabama
corporation (âMonex ALâ) (collectively the âRelief Defendantsâ), from destroying, altering,
or disposing of, or refusing to permit authorized representatives of the Commission to inspect

and copy any books or records or other documents, including electronically stored
Case 1:15-cv-00538-WKW-TFM Document 8 Filed 07/27/15 Page 2 of 11

information (âESIâ), and further enjoining Defendants and Relief Defendants from
withdrawing, transferring, removing, dissipating, or disposing of any funds, assets or other
property. The Court has considered the pleadings, declarations, exhibits, and memorandum
filed in support of the Commissionâs motion for a statutory restraining order, and finds that:

l. This Court has jurisdiction over the parties and over the subject matter of this
action pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2012), and Section 2(c)(2) of the
Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(c)(2) (2012).

2. Venue lies properly within this District pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act, 7
U.S.C. 13a-1(e) (2012) in that the acts or practices described in the Complaint took place
and/or are taking place within this District.

3. There is good cause to believe that Defendants have engaged in, are engaging
in and are about to engage in certain unlawful conduct, including, but not limited to: a
fraudulent scheme involving the offering of agreements, contracts or transactions in off-
exchange foreign currency (âforexâ) on a leveraged, margined, or financed basis, totaling
more than $27 million, to retail customers who were not eligible contract customers (âECPsâ)
and that do not result in actual delivery of forex within two (2) days of the transaction date(s);
the failure of DCI and Monex NV to register with the Commission as registered foreign
exchange dealers (âRFEDâ); and the failure of Tayeh to register with the Commission as an
associated person (âAPâ) of the RFEDs DCI and/or Monex NV, in connection with financed
retail forex transactions as described in Section 2(c)(2)(C)(i) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
Â§ 2(c)(2)(C)(i) (which are subject to the anti-fraud provisions of Section 4b(a)(2)(A) and (C)
of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6b(a)(2)(A), (C), pursuant to Sections 2(c)(2)(C)Gi)() and

2(c)(2)(C)(iv) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 2(c)(2)(C)(ii)(), 2(c)(2)(C)(iv)), in violation of Sections
Case 1:15-cv-00538-WKW-TFM Document 8 Filed 07/27/15 Page 3of11

2(c)(2)(C)(iii)(1)(aa), and 4b(a)(2)(A), (C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 2(c)(2)(C)Gii)()(aa) and
6b(a)(2)(A), (C) (2012), and Commission Regulation 5.3(a)(6)(i) and (ii), 17 C.F.R.
Â§5.3(a)(6)(i) and (ii) (2014). In addition, there is good cause to believe that some of the
Defendantsâ customersâ funds have been and/or are currently held in one or more accounts in
the name of, or under the control of, Relief Defendants, who have no legitimate interest in or
entitlement to these funds received as a result of Defendantsâ unlawful conduct.

4. There is good cause to believe that immediate and irreparable damage to the
Courtâs ability to grant effective final relief for customers in the form of monetary redress will
occur from the sale, transfer, assignment, or other disposition by Defendants and/or Relief
Defendants of assets or records unless Defendants and Relief Defendants are immediately
restrained and enjoined by Order of the Court.

5. There is good cause for the Court to impose a restraining order prohibiting
Defendants and Relief Defendants and their agents, servants, employees, attorneys, and other
persons who are in active concert or participation with them, from withdrawing, transferring,
removing, dissipating, or disposing of any funds, assets, or other property owned, controlled,
managed, or held by or on behalf of, or for the benefit of Defendants and/or Relief
Defendants.

6. There is good cause for entry of an order prohibiting Defendants and Relief
Defendants, and their agents, servants, employees, assigns, attorneys, and persons in active
concert or participation with the Defendants and/or Relief Defendants, including any
successor thereof, from destroying records and/or denying agents of the Commission access to
inspect and copy records to ensure that Commission representatives have immediate and

complete access to all such books and records.
Case 1:15-cv-00538-WKW-TFM Document 8 Filed 07/27/15 Page 4 of11

7, Absent the entry of this statutory restraining order, the Defendants and Relief
Defendants are likely to dissipate or transfer assets and destroy business records.

8. This is a proper case for granting an ex parte statutory restraining order to
preserve the status quo, protect public customers from loss and damage, and enable the
Commission to fulfill its statutory duties, therefore the Court orders as follows:
