CFTC Orders Marubeni America Corporation to Pay $800,000 for Inaccurately Reporting
Positions in Multiple Grains

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today issued an Order filing and
simultaneously settling charges against Marubeni America Corporation (Marubeni), a dealer and merchant of
agricultural commodities and the largest overseas subsidiary of Japan-based Marubeni Corporation, for failing to comply
with its legal obligation to submit accurate monthly CFTC Form 204 Reports, regarding the composition of Marubeniâs
fixed price cash grain purchases and sales, in violation of the reporting requirements in CFTC Regulation 19.01.

As the CFTC Order states, under CFTC Regulations all persons holding or controlling reportable futures and options
positions in certain agricultural commodities (including wheat, corn, oats, soybeans, soybean oil, and soybean meal) and
any part of which constitute bona fide hedging positions as defined in CFTC Regulation 1.3(z), are required to file CFTC
Form 204 reports showing the composition of their fixed price cash position in each such commodity hedged. According
to the Order, a purpose of the Form 204 report is to check compliance with speculative position limits by ensuring that
filers that classify their futures positions as hedging actually own or control offsetting cash positions.

The Order finds that during the period from July 2010 through August 2013, Marubeni held reportable positions in Form
204 commodities and was required to file Form 204 reports showing the quantities of the fixed price purchase and sale
open cash positions of such commodities it hedged. The Order further finds that during the relevant period Marubeni filed
38 Form 204 reports with the CFTC that did not accurately state the quantities of Marubeniâs fixed price cash positions of
each such commodity it hedged. Specifically, the Order finds that Marubeni included in its Form 204 reports both basis
and fixed priced cash positions. As noted in the CFTC Order, Marubeni thereafter submitted corrected Form 204 reports.

The CFTC Order requires Marubeni to pay an $800,000 civil monetary penalty and to cease and desist from committing
further violations of CFTC Regulation 19.01.

Consistent with this filing, the CFTCâs Division of Market Oversight has issued an advisory regarding the obligation of
market participants to submit accurate Form 204 reports (see CFTC Staff Advisory No. 13-42, Obligation of Reportable
Market Participants to File CFTC Form 204 Reports, which is linked in CFTC Press Release 6639-13, July 8, 2013).

The Division of Market Oversight staff members responsible for this matter are Matthew Hunter, Harry Hild, Eugene
Kunda, and David Amato. The Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this action are Jordon Grimm, Linda
Y. Peng, Trevor Kokal, David W. MacGregor, Lenel Hickson, Jr., and Manal M. Sultan.
