CFTC Orders Chicago-based E*TRADE Securities LLC and E*TRADE Clearing LLC to Paya
$280,000 Civil Monetary Penalty for Failure to Retain Required Records and Failure to
Diligently Supervise

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today issued an Order filing and settling
charges against E*TRADE Securities LLC (E*TRADE Securities), an Introducing Broker, and E*TRADE Clearing LLC
(E*TRADE Clearing), a Futures Commission Merchant, for non-compliance with applicable record-keeping rules and failure
to diligently supervise. Both entities have their headquarters in Chicago, Illinois.

The CFTC Order finds that between October 2009 and January 25, 2014, E*TRADE Securities did not preserve and
maintain certain audit trail logs for their customers. Similarly, E*TRADE Clearing did not preserve and maintain customer
audit trail logs after becoming registered as a Futures Commission Merchant in February 2013.

Violations of Regulations 1.31 & 1.35

The Order finds that by not preserving and maintaining these records, E*TRADE Securities and E*TRADE Clearing violated
Section 4g(a) of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC Regulations 1.31 and 1.35.

Regulation 166.3 Violation

In addition, the Order finds that E*TRADE Securities and E*TRADE Clearing violated CFTC Regulation 166.3 by failing to
implement policies and procedures to ensure the retention of these records and failing to respond to a previous warning
from its vendor that it did not preserve these records

The CFTC Order requires E*TRADE Securities and E*TRADE Clearing jointly to pay a $280,000 civil monetary penalty and
to cease and desist from further violations of the CEA, as charged. To prevent similar problems in the future, the Order
also requires E*TRADE Securities and E*TRADE Clearing to improve their recordkeeping procedures by updating their
policies and procedures and providing appropriate training to officers and employees regarding the CEAâs recordkeeping
requirements.

The Order recognizes the cooperation of E*TRADE Securities and E*TRADE Clearing in this matter.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are AimÃ©e Latimer-Zayets, A. Daniel Ullman Il, and
Paul G. Hayeck.
