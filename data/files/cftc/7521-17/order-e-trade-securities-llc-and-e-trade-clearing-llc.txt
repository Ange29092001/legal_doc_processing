ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTIONS 6(c) AND 6(d) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, MAKING
FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

I.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ) has reason to believe that
E*TRADE Securities LLC and E*TRADE Clearing LLC (âRespondentsâ) violated Section 4g(a)
of the Commodity Exchange Act (the âActâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6g(a) (2012), and Commission
Regulations (âRegulationsâ) 1.31, 1.35, and 166.3, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1.31, 1.35, and 166.3 (2016).
Therefore, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest that public
administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted to determine whether Respondents
engaged in the violations set forth herein and to determine whether any order should be issued
imposing remedial sanctions.

Il.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Respondents have
submitted jointly an Offer of Settlement (âOfferâ), which the Commission has determined to
accept. Without admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, Respondents
consent to the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 6(c) and 6(d) of
the Commodity Exchange Act, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (âOrderââ)
and acknowledges service of this Order.â

 

' Respondents consent to the entry of this Order and to the use of these findings in this

proceeding and in any other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission
is a party; provided, however, that Respondents do not consent to the use of the Offer, or the
findings or conclusions in this Order consented to in the Offer, as the sole basis for any other
proceedingbrought by the Commission, other than in a proceeding in bankruptcy or to enforce
the terms of this Order. Nor do Respondents consent to the use of the Offer or this Order, or the
findings or conclusions in this Order consented to in the Offer, by any other party in any other
proceeding.
II.
The Commission finds the following:
A. SUMMARY

Prior to January 24, 2014, Respondents failed to preserve and maintain certain audit trail
logs for their customers. Such logs were compiled by a third-party vendor, which routinely
destroyed the records after 10 days. Upon discovery of its vendorâs document retention policy,
on January 24, 2014, Respondents made efforts to recover missing audit logs; however, they
were unable to locate, and lost, more than three yearsâ worth of data, in violation of Section 4g(a)
of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6g(a) (2012), and Regulations 1.31 and 1.35, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1.31 and 1.35
(2016). Moreover, Respondents failed to implement policies and procedures to ensure the
retention of these records, and failed to respond to a previous warning from its vendor that it did
not preserve these records, in violation of Regulation 166.3, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 166.3 (2016).

B. RESPONDENTS

E*TRADE Securities LLC (âE*TRADE Securitiesâ) has been registered as an
Introducing Broker (âIBâ) since 2002, with headquarters at 233 S Wacker Dr., Willis Tower 40th
Floor, Chicago, Illinois. Its registration as a Futures Commission Merchant (âFCMâ) is pending.
E*TRADE Securities is a wholly-owned, indirect subsidiary of E*TRADE Financial
Corporation (âE*TRADE Financialâ), a Delaware corporation headquartered in New York.

E*TRADE Clearing LLC (âE*TRADE Clearingâ) has been registered as an FCM since
February 2013, with headquarters at 233 S Wacker Dr., Willis Tower 40th Floor, Chicago,
Illinois. E*TRADE Clearingâs only customers are those directly introduced by E*TRADE
Securities. It is also a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of E*TRADE Financial.

C. FACTS

In January 2014, as part of an internal review, E*TRADE Securities and E*TRADE
Clearing (collectively, the âE*TRADE entitiesâ) learned that they had not preserved certain of
their customersâ electronic audit trail logs, in keeping with the requirements of Section 4g(a) of
the Act and Regulations 1.31 and 1.35, between October 2009 and January 25, 2014.

Throughout the relevant period, E*TRADE Securities used a third-party vendor to
provide the front-end order entry system for all of E*TRADE Securitiesâ futures customers. The
third-party vendor generated audit trail logs on a monthly basis from this records system.
E*TRADE Securities erroneously believed that the third-party vendor retained these logs, and
that E*TRADE Securities could access them at any time, via a secure FTP web site. However,
the third-party vendor retained these monthly logs for only 10 days. The third-party vendor
previously warned E*TRADE Securities employees of its retention policy in emails dated
November 2012. In those emails, the third-party vendor advised that it was E*TRADE
Securitiesâ responsibility to download and retain these files. E*TRADE Securities employees
took inadequate action to preserve the audit logs after receiving this information from the third-
party vendor.
Similarly, E*TRADE Clearing incorrectly believed that its recordkeeping requirements
were Satisfied because all of its documents were stored in an internal database. E*TRADE
Clearing was mistaken, however: the database did not store audit logs. Accordingly, E*TRADE
Clearing erroneously represented to the NFA in December 2013 that it was in compliance with
all CFTC recordkeeping requirements. Both of the E*TRADE entities subsequently self-
reported their recordkeeping violations to the Commission.

Beginning January 26, 2014, both E*TRADE entities ensured that audit logs were
automatically downloaded on a daily basis from the third-party vendorâs FTP site and preserved
on the internal database. The E*TRADE entities also took steps to recover missing audit logs
from the previous five years. However, E*TRADE Securities was unable to recover audit logs
from October 2009 through October 31, 2011, and from June 20, 2012, through December 31,
2012. Both E*TRADE Securities and E*TRADE Clearing were unable to recover audit logs
from March 1, 2013, through January 25, 2014.

An October 2014 internal E*TRADE audit of the E*TRADE Securities Derivatives
Service Desk confirmed a âmajorâ Rule 1.35 violation regarding the missing audit logs. During
the relevant time period, neither E*TRADE Securities nor E*TRADE Clearing had written
policies or procedures in place to comply with CFTC recordkeeping requirements.â In March
2015, more than a year after learning of its ongoing failure to retain audit logs, E*TRADE
Securities updated its Manual to include specific references to CFTC Rule 1.35 recordkeeping
requirements.

Similarly, E*TRADE Clearingâs pre-2015 âWritten Supervisory Procedures Futures and
FOREXâ Manual contained no reference to CFTC recordkeeping requirements. E*TRADE
Clearing updated this Manual in 2015 to expressly require compliance with Rule 1.35.
E*TRADE Clearing self-reported to the CFTC and the NFA that it did not retain the requisite
audit logs between April 1, 2013, the effective date of its FCM registration, and January 2014.

The Commission recognizes Respondentsâ cooperation with the Commission in this
matter.

IV.
LEGAL DISCUSSION
A. RECORDKEEPING VIOLATIONS

As an introducing broker and futures commission merchant, respectively, E*TRADE
Securities and E*TRADE Clearing are required to comply with the recordkeeping obligations set
forth in Section 4g(a) of the Act and Regulations 1.31(a) and 1.35(a). Section 4g âprovides that
every person registered as a futures commission merchant, introducing broker, floor broker, or floor
trader shall keep books and records pertaining to transactions and positions of their customers and

 

* By comparison, E*TRADE Securities ensured that it retained audit trail records for certain securities orders, in
keeping with other (non-CFTC) regulatory requirements. For such orders, the 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014 Versions
of E*TRADE Securitiesâ Written Supervisory Proceduresâ Manual (âManualâ) stated that âE*TRADE will retain
and preserve [order audit trail] records for at least three years, the first two years in an easily accessible location.â
commodities for future delivery, and shall make such records available for inspection by the
Commission.â Woods, CFTC No. 15-02, 2014 WL 5089105, at *5 (Oct. 8, 2014) (citing 7 U.S.C.
8 6g(a) (2012)) (consent order). Regulation 1.35 requires FCMs and IBs to keep âfull, complete,
and systematic records, together with all pertinent data and memoranda, of all transactions
relating to its business of dealing in commodity futures.â Regulation 1.31 requires that such
records be preserved for five years. See 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.35(a)(1) (2016). Moreover, if such
records are preserved electronically, registrants must â[dJevelop and maintain written operational
procedures and controlsâ to ensure the proper preservation of such records. 17 C.F.R. Â§
1.31(a)(3)Gi) 2016).

The failure to retain and promptly produce such records for inspection to Commission
staff constitutes a violation of Section 4g and Regulations 1.31 and 1.35. Woods, 2014 WL
5089105, at *4-6, 8 (finding that an IB violated Section 4g of the Act and Regulation 1.35 by
failing to preserve certain customer order records); Forex Capital Mkts. LLC, CFTC No. 12-01,
2011 WL 4689390, at *4-5 (Oct. 3, 2011) (holding that an FCM violated Section 4g of the Act
and Regulation 1.35 by failing to promptly produce records requested by Division of
Enforcement staff) (consent order). A violation of these record-keeping regulations does not
require scienter. /d. (citing GNP Commodities, Inc., [1990-1992 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L.
Rep. (CCH) J 25,360 at 39,214 (Aug. 11, 1992), aff'd in part and rev'd in part sub nom.,
Monieson v. CFTC, 996 F. 2d 852 7" Cir. 1993)); see also DiPlacido, {2003-2004 Transfer
Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. { 29,866 at 56,590 (CFTC Sept. 14, 2004), aff'd 364 F. Appâx 657
(2d Cir. 2009).

As explained by the Commission:

The requirements of Regulations 1.31 and 1.35 are straightforward.
Regulation 1.35(a) required [the registrant] to keep complete and
systematic records, âtogether with all pertinent data and
memoranda, of all transactions relating to its business of dealing in
commodity futures, commodity options....â Further, the rule
required [the registrant] to maintain copies of âall other records
data and memoranda ... prepared in the course of its business....â
Id. (emphasis added) ... The trade sequence reports clearly relate
to [the registrantâs] business of dealing in commodity futures and
were kept in the course of [the registrantâs] business. Failure to
maintain them thus violates Regulations 1.31 and 1.35(a).

JCC, Inc., [1992-1994 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) 26,080 at 41,580 (CFTC
May 12, 1994), aff'd sub nom. JCC, Inc. v. CFTC, 63 F.3d 1557 qi" Cir. 1995); accord Woods,
2014 WL 5089105.

The facts set forth above demonstrate that the E*TRADE entities failed to retain and
preserve customer order audit logs between October 2009 and January 26, 2014. Although they
have since recovered some of these logs, they have permanently lost more than three years of
records. This failure to retain and preserve these records violated Section 4g(a) of the Act and
Regulations 1.31(a) and 1.35(a).
B. SUPERVISION FAILURES

Both of the E*TRADE entities failed to develop appropriate procedures to ensure
compliance with the recordkeeping requirements of Section 4g(a), in violation of Regulation
166.3. Before March 2015, neither of the E*TRADE entities included any reference to
compliance with Section 4g or Regulations 1.31 and 1.35 in their internal compliance manuals.
Moreover, before March 2015, neither E*TRADE entity had any systems in place to ensure that
such records were preserved.

A violation of Regulation 166.3 is demonstrated by showing either that: (1) the
registrantâs supervisory system was generally inadequate; or (2) the registrant failed to perform
its supervisory duties diligently. Forex Capital Mkts., 2011 WL 4689390, at *3 (citing Murlas
Commodities, CFTC No. 85-29, 1995 WL 523563, at *9((Sept. 1, 1995); GNP Commodities,
[1990-1992 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) J 25,360 at 39,219 (providing that,
even if an adequate supervisory system is in place, Regulation 166.3 can still be violated if the
supervisory system is not diligently administered); Paragon Futures Ass ân, CFTC No. 88-18,
1992 WL 74261, at *14 (Apr. 1, 1992) (concluding that the âfocus of any proceeding to
determine whether Rule 166.3 has been violated will be on whether [a] review [has] occurred
and, if it did, whether it was âdiligentââ). A violation under Regulation 166.3 is an independent
violation for which no underlying violation is necessary. Forex Capital Mkts., 2011 WL
4689390, at *3.

Regulation 166.3 further provides that a registrant has a âduty to develop procedures for
the âdetection and deterrence of [CEA violations] by its agents.ââ Samson Refining Co. v. Drexel
Burnham Lambert, Inc., CFTC No. 82-R448, 1990 WL 282783, at *11 (Feb. 16, 1990) (quoting
Lobb v. J.T. McKerr & Co., CFTC No. 85R-185 (Dec. 14, 1989), slip op. at 25). While the
absence of a written policy or formal training on every potential issue does not constitute a
failure to supervise, Regulation 166.3 requires all registered FCMs and IBs to diligently
supervise all activities of its officers, employees, and agents relating to its business. FCStone,
LLC, CFTC No. 15-21, 2015 WL 2066891 (May 1, 2015). âA showing that the registrant lacks
an adequate supervisory system, standing alone, can be sufficientâ to demonstrate a violation of
Regulation 166.3. /d. (citing Paragon Futures Assân, 1992 WL 74261, at *14). Evidence of
violations that âshould be detected by a diligent system of supervision, either because of the
nature of the violations or because the violations have occurred repeatedlyâ is probative of a
failure to supervise. Forex Capital Mkts. LLC, No. 12-01 (CFTC October 3, 2011) (quoting
Paragon Futures Assân, 1992 WL 74261, at *14).

The E*TRADE entities violated Regulation 166.3 in two ways. First, the E*TRADE
entities failed to implement any procedures to consistently retain audit trail logs required to be
preserved by the Act. Second, E*TRADE Securities failed to follow up on warnings from its
third-party vendor in November 2012 that the audit trail logs were not being preserved by the
vendor. If E*TRADE Securities had an adequate supervisory system in place and properly
supervised its employees regarding all of its recordkeeping requirements, it could have addressed
its ongoing recordkeeping violations in November 2012. Instead, E*TRADE Securities failed to
consider the issue and thus continued not preserving these records. The failure to address
repeated violations of the Act also represents a violation of Regulation 166.3. Woods, 2014 WL
5089105, at *7 (citing CFTC v. Sidoti, 178 F.3d 1132, 1137 (11th Cir. 1999) (defendant was
liable for failure to supervise because he âknew of specific instances of [violations], yet failed to
take reasonable steps to correct the problemsâ)).
