i.
FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

The Court, being fully advised in the premises, finds that there is good cause for the
entry of this Order and that there is no just reason for delay. The Court therefore directs the
entry of findings of fact, conclusions of law and a permanent injunction and ancillary
equitable relief pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2006), as set forth
herein.

FINDINGS OF FACT

 

A. Formation of NHM and North Hills Fund
1, In or around 1995, Bloom formed the North Hills Fund (âthe Fundâ) and
created NHM, as the general partner of the Fund, Bloom is the sole principal and owner of

NHM. The Fund initially was purportedly designed to be an enhanced stock index fund and
Case 19-cv-O01751-JGK Document 79 Filed 06/11/2010. Page Â§ of 26

traded, among other instruments, commodity futures contracts and options. In 2001, Bloom
converted the Fund to an âabsolute return fundâ that would invest in other funds, i-e., a
| âfund of funds.â

2. Defendants represented orally and in writing to existing and prospective
Fund participants that Defendants would invest Fund assets in a number of other funds and,
through diversification and lack of correlation, achieve a âmarket-neutralâ return of
approximately 12%.

3, Defendants provided existing and prospective Fund participants with a
Private Placement Memorandum (âPPMâ) dated August 7, 2001, which attached a copy of
the North Hills Limited Partnership Agreement (the âLPAâ), subscription materials, and a
Partnership Agreement Supplement. The LPA identified the objects and purposes of the
Fund as investing and trading, on margin or otherwise in all forms of financial investments,
including in commodities and commodity contracts.

4, âThe PPM represented that â[t]he Fundâs multi-manager, multi-strategy
approach has been designed to achieve above-average capital appreciation consistent with
moderate risk.â The PPM emphasized that â[t]hrough a program of diversified asset
management, the Fund will be able to take advantage of investment opportunities with a
significant potential reward, while reducing the risk of a substantial decline in the value of

Partnership assets.â Similarly, the PPM stated that a principal advantage of the Fund is its

 

âpolicy of seeking satisfactory returns while minimizing total risk.â
5. According to the PPM and LPA, Fund participants were to receive monthly
reports and annual financial statements audited by an independent certified public

accountant.
Case 1:09-ev-07751-UGK Document 79 Filed Q6/71/2010 Page 7 of 26

6. The PPM also provides for management and incentive fees for NHM based
upon the profitability of the Fund.

7. The PPM also represented that NHM uses a management team comprised of
consultants of Access International Advisors, EIM, USA and members of the Board of
Directors that was to be responsible for the selection of money managers. It is unknown
whether such a management team ever existed or was used by Defendants.

8. Defendants instructed prospective Fund participants to execute a copy of the
solicitation materials and send a check payable to North Hills LP. The minimum initial
capital contribution allowed is $250,000,

9, Based on Detendantsâ representations, the Fund had at least 30-40
participants and should have had assets of at least $30-40 million at one time.

10. Fund participants relied upon Defendantsâ representations, the PPM, LPA
and other solicitation materials and information concerning the Fund trading strategy in
deciding whether to invest, remain invested or make additional investments with Defendants
and the Fund.

1]. Fund participants included the Alexander Dawson Foundation (âADFâ) and
Alexander Dawson Inc. (âADIâ). ADF is a Nevada Charitable Trust that supports schools
and over 1,000 students in Nevada and Colorado. ADI is an investment arm of ADF.

ADIâs and ADPâs investment goals were to achicve modcrate returns with limited risk.

 

Inasmuch as Defendantsâ representations concerning the investment strategy for the Fund
was consistent with their goals for their charitable endeavors, ADI and ADF decided to
maintain their prior investments in the Fund and over time increased in their investments.

ADF and ADI collectively invested $13.5 million with Bloom and NHM through the Fund.
Case 1:09-cv-O1781-JGR Document ?â9 â Filed G6/11/2010 Page 8 of 26

12. Fund participants received monthly account statements that consistently
showed positive returns. Fund participants relied on these statements and made additional
investments in the Fund.

13. Although required by the LPA to provide annual financial statements to
participants in the Fund, Defendants did not.

B. Bloom and NHMMisappropriate at Least $13 Million of Fund Assets

14. During the relevant period, Defendants misappropriated at least $13 million
of the assets of the Fund for the personal use of Bloom and his wife, Relief Defendant
Lauren Bloom. Defendants took the assets of the Fund by executing purporied promissory
notes with the Fund bearing an interest rate of the higher of 8% or the rate of return earned
on all other Partnership assets, net of expenses.

18. A purported independently certified annual financial statement for the Fund
for the year ending December 31, 2002, lists notes receivable in the amount of $2.75 million
as assets of the Fund. The notes to the financial statement set forth two notes as receivables
from NHM to the Fund and state that â[t]he notes receivable were issued as capital
contributions by [NHM].â At least some of the Fundâs participants never received this
financial statement until around or after November 2008.

16. A purported independently certified financial statement for the Fund for the

year ending December 31, 2003, lists additional notes receivable in the amount of $5.255

 

 

million as assets of the Fund as well as the 2002 notes for a total of approximately $8
million. The notes to the financial statement sets forth the notes as receivables from NHM
to the Fund and states that â[t]he notes receivable were issued as capital contributions by

[NHM]â and were charged against managementâs capital, At least some, ifnot all, of the

 
Case t0-cv-O01751-JGK Document 79 Filed 06/11/2010 Page 9 of 26

Fundâs participants never received this financial statement until around or after November,
2068.

17. A Consolidated and Restated Demand Note (âthe Consolidated Noteâ) in the
amount of $13,230,000.00 and dated December 31, 2004, was executed by Bloom on behalf
of NHM through which NHM âborrowedâ the assets of the Fund with promise to repay at
the interest rate of the greater of 8% or the rate of return earned on all other partnership
assets, net of expenses. The Consolidated Note was payable on demand. However, the
Fundâs general partner was NHM and NHM executed the Note on behalf of the Fund and
itself. Upon information and belief, NHM on behalf of the Fund never demanded payment
on the Consolidated Note from itself or Bloom.

18. By the same date of December 31, 2004, Bloom executed a Guaranty
Agreement to and in favor of the Fund in his name and his wifeâs name through which he
personally guaranteed payment and performance on the Consolidated Note. The Guaranty
Agreement provides that the funds borrowed may in whole or in part be provided to or for
the benefit of the Guarantors, the Blooms, and provides that each Guarantor will benefit or
has materially benefited from the proceeds of the Note.

19. Until recently, Defendants did not disclose to any Fund participant that they
were taking assets of the Fund to benefit personally Bloom and his wife.

20. By letter dated November 7, 2008, Defendantsâ counsel disclosed to certain

 

 

Fund participants that âother than assets allocated to {the Philadelphia Alternative Asset
Fund (âPAAFââ)] the remaining assets are in the form of notes payable from NHM which is
presently unable to repay the debt.â Counsel stated it was in excess of $8 million.

21. Throughout the relevant period, as the Blooms were taking more than $13
ase 1:09-cv-01751-JGK Document 79 Filed 06/11/2010 | Page 10 of 26

million of Fund assets, the Blooms maintained a lavish lifestyle. For example, in or around
March 3, 2003, the Blooms purchased a luxury apartment at 10 Gracie Square on the Upper
East Side of Manhattan for $5.2 million. Two years later, on around June or July 2005,
Bloom transferred his ownership to his wife who sold it in 2007 for $11.2 million.

22. During the relevant period, Bloom and his wife maintained multiple
apartments in Upper Manhattan, owned a condominium in Boynton Beach, Florida,
maintained a boat, and leased several Juxury cars. |

23. The Fundâs participants would not have invested or maintained investments
with Defendants and the Fund if they had known that Defendants had engaged in self-
dealing and taken at least $13 million of Fund assets. However, because they did not know
and instead were receiving monthly statement showing profitable returns, the Fundâs
participants made additional investments in the Fund throughout the relevant period.

Cc. Bloom and NHM Invested Contrary to

Represented Investment Strategy and Failed
to Disclose Conflict of Interest with PAAF Investment

24, Commencing in or around January 2004, Bloom entered into a Client
Referral and Fee Sharing Agreement Fee Sharing Agreement with the Philadelphia
Alternative Asset Management Company (âPAAMâ), a registered Commodity Pool
Operator (âCPOâ) managing multiple commodity futures and options pools, including

PAA.

 

25. Pursuant to that agreement, PAAM paid Bloom fees for directly or indirectly
referring investors to the funds managed by PAAM. Bloom received approximately $1.6
million for referring investors to PAAM.

26. Commencing in February 2004 and thereafter, Defendants invested assets of

10
Case 1:09-cv-01751-UGK Document.79 Filed 06/11/2010 Page ti of 26

the Fund in PAAF, and Bloom collected referral fees based on the Fundâs investment in
PAAF of approximately $356,000.

27. Eventually, Defendants had approximately $18 million of the Fundâs assets
in PAAF, which comprised approximately more than half of the assets of the Fund. This
concentration in one fund was contrary to the multi-asset, multi-manager, diversified
strategy represented in the PPM and LPA.

28. In addition, PAAF traded exclusively commodity futures and options, which
Defendants knew or should have known, are highly risky. Defendantsâ investment in PAAF
was contrary to the diversification with reduction of risk approach that Defendants
represented in the PPM to be the investment strategy of the Fund. It was also contrary to the
reason why the Fundâs participants invested with Defendants and the Fund.

29. Fund participants did not learn of the concentrated and risky investment in

PAAF until July 2005 when Defendants informed them that the CFTC had filed a massive
fraud action against PAAM and Paul Eustace (âEustaceâ) anc seized the assets under their
control, including the assets of PAAF. See CFTC v. Philadelphia Alternative Asset
Management Co, and Eustace, Civ. Action 05-2973 (E.D. Pa.).

30. Fund participants were shocked to learn of the concentrated investment in
PAAF and did not view it as consistent with the investment strategy of the Fund represented

in the PPM and LPA.

 

31, Like his failure to disclose that he had âloanedâ his wife and himself $13
million of Fund assets through promissory notes issued by NHM, Bloom never disclosed ta
the Fundâs participants that he was a third-party marketer for PAAM and earning fees.

Bloom did not disclose it even after he disclosed the concentrated investment in PAAF.

 

Il
Case 1:09-cv-01757-JGK Document 79 Filed 06/11/2010. Page 12 of 26

32. Instead of disclosing that Defendants had taken $13 million of Fund assets,
that morc than half of the assets were concentrated in one highly risky commodity futures
and options fund and that Bloom was collecting commissions from the Fundâs investment in
PAAF, Defendants continued to issue false statements that misrepresented the nature and
status of the Fund. For instance, in April 2004, Defendants issued to certain Fund
participants an âExecutive Summaryâ for the Fund which reiterated the balanced fund with
a mmulti-strategy diversified risk approach. The Executive Summary provided investment .
allocation information, set forth the purported annual rates of return for each purported
manager used, and represented that the Fundâs average annual rate of return from July 2001
through December 2003 was 11.27%.

33, In addition, Defendants were meeting with the Fundâs participants and orally
making similar material misrepresentations and omissions.

34. To reassure certain Fund participants concerning the Defendantsâ
compliance and diligence, Defendants retained a purported third-party sub-advisor who also
met with participants. Through the sub-advisor, Defendants issued performance reports in
June 2004, June 2005 and June 2006. None of the reports disclosed the $13 million of
assets taken by NHM for Bloomâs and his wifeâs use. The June 2005 report purports to list
the hedge funds in which the Fund was invested. The June 2005 report did not list the

approximately $18 million in PAAF and instcad listed the allocations as follows: Airlie

 

10%, Centrix 5%, Gramercy 25%, Millennium 25%, Stewardship 25%.

D. In 2006, Bloom Testified that a Fund Manager Should
Disclose Conflicts and that He Would Never Invest Ina

12
Case 1:09-cv-O1751-HoK Document 79 ried 06/17/2010 Page i3of 26 .

Fund Where a Manager Loans Himself Fund Assets
35. Bloom knew that borrowing funds and collecting third-party fees were
conflicts of interest and material facts reasonable mvestors would have wanted to know. In
fact, in sworn testimony in the CFTCâs action against PAAM and Eustace in 2006, Bloom
vehemently declared that defendant Eustace should have disclosed similar types of âloansâ
he made to himself out of PAAF assets and that Bloom never would have invested with
Eustace if he had known Eustace was borrowing PAAF assets.

E. Bloom and NHM Misrepresented the
Status of the Fundâs Interests in PAAF

36. In the CFTCâs action against PAAM and Eustace, the court immediately
appointed a receiver to marshal and distribute assets belonging to the various funds operated
by PAAM and/or Eustace, including PAAF. The various funds defrauded by PAAM and
Eustace had assets invested totaling approximately $250 million, with PAAF having
approximately $28 million, The Fund's assets comprised more than half of PAAFâs assets.

37, As of the end of December 2008, the receiver in the CFTCâs action against
PAAM had distributed approximately $161 million across all the funds. Approximately $19
million of the $161 million was apportioned to PAAF and another fund into which Eustace
had moved PAAF assets. The Fundâs percentage interest in the approximate $19 million

was approximately 54%.

 

 

oF te REC I VET ASSET total cistributions in the name of the Fund of
approximately $9.6 million. Four distributions were made in the name of the Fund: 1) on
December 26, 2006, approximately $1.8 million; 2) on December 15, 2008, approximately
$4.2 million; 3) on March 5, 2008, approximately $1.6 million; and 4) on December 28,

2009, approximately $ 1.7 million.

13
fase 1:09-cv-01751-JGK Document 79S Filed 06/11/2010 Page 14 of 26 |

39. Onor around September 27, 2006, unbeknownst to the Fundâs participants,
Bloom, on behalf of the Fund executed a Participation Agreement with Stonehill
Institutional Partners, L.P. (âStonehillâ). Pursuant to this agreement, Bloom compromised
any return the Fund would receive from the receivership estate in the PAAM case. The
Participation Agreement granted Stonehill a participation interest in the Fundâs interest in
PAAF and any amounts payable to the Fund from PAAF and the Receiver. As evidenced
by executed instructions to the Receiver, all distributions in the name of the Fund were to be
made to Stonehill with correspondence and other information continuing to be sent to
Defendants.

40. Pursuant to the Participation Agreement, Bloom received from Stonehill in
the name of the Fund upfront payments of approximately $2.3 million. Thereafter, Stonehill
retained 20% of any PAAF distributions to the Fund and forwarded the remaining 80% to
Bloom in the name of the Fund. Asa result, Bloom received in the name of the Fund
approximately $8 million from Stonehill,

41. Defendants did not disclose to the Fundâs participants that Bloom had
entered into the Participation Agreement with Stonehill. To the contrary, Bloom routinely
sent written updates on the status of the CFTCâs action, the receivership estate and the
likelihood of recovering assets without ever mentioning the Stonehill agreement, that the

receiver had made distributions and that Bloom had received payments relating to the PAAF

 

 

distributions. Defendants also continued to send out monthly statements to Fund
participants that did not credit or otherwise account for such distributions.
42. The Fundâs participants expected any distributions made by the Receiver in

the name of the Fund to then be distributed appropriately to them by Defendants.

14
Case 1:09-ev-01751-JGK  BDocurent.79 Filed G6/11/2010 Page 15 of 26

43. After the filing of the CFTC action against PAAM and Eustace, the Fundâs
participants began requesting full redemptions from the Fund. These requested redemptions
have not.occurred. Some Fund participants received partial redemptions; others have
received nothing. The Fundâs participants are out millions of dollars due to Defendantsâ
fraud. Defendants used delaying tactics, lies, cbfuscations and excuses, ranging from poor
liquidity to blaming the Madoff debacle, to avoid meeting those demands.

44, For example, in August 2005, after learning of the PAAM fraud, two related
Fund participants who collectively had invested approximately $13.5 million immediately
questioned Defendants and asked about redemptions. Bloom promised that they would not
jose anything as a result of the PAAF demise and made a partial redemption payment of $4
million in the fall of 2005. On November 30, 2007, they requested redemption of another
$3.5 million. Bloom tried to delay responding to that request with excuses of a plan to
increase performance with a new manager. In January 2008, the two Fund participants
requested full redemption of their entire $13.8 million, or at least the $4.8 million of their
funds that was not purportedly in the PAAF investment. In March 2008, Defendants
redeemed only $1 million to them.

45. Throughout, Defendants continued to send monthly statements showing
positive balances. For instance, the two Fund participants discussed in paragraph 44, above,

reccived September 30, 2008 account statements showing collectively that they had over

 

 

$12 million in capital with approximately $7.7 million allocated to PAAF and showing a
gain of approximately $5,000 on the remaining $4.7 million. In October 2008, the two Fund
participants demanded documentation and an accounting of their investments and the assets

of the Fund, Eventually, they learned through Bloomâs counsel that he had taken assets of

1S
fase 1:09-cv-01751-JGK Document79S Filed 06/11/2010 Page 16 of 26.

Fund as âloansâ to himself.

46. Since the filing of the CFTCâs action against PAAM and Eustace, Bloom
personally appeared in federal court in that action representing the Fund anc other funds he
managed and claiming to be a victim of fraud.

47. Defendants knowingly or with reckless disregard for the truth committed the .
foregoing acts of fraud, misappropriation, false statements and reports, and material
misrepresentations and omissions of fact.

48. | Defendants continued to solicit new funds from new prospective participants
and tried to delay meeting demands from Fund participants. Indeed, by letter dated
February 11, 2009 and on Fund letterhead, Bloom represented âI am in the process of
securing funds which should allow me to return the full amount of your investment balance.
My hope is that it can be all worked out in the next month. | ask for your patience, as my
success in that endeavor offers you the greatest chance for the best possible return of your
investment.â
