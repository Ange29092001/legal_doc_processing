Exchange Act (âCEAâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1-26 (2012), and Commission Regulations 17 C.F.R. pt. 1-
190 (2018). Upon leave of the Court, Plaintiff filed an amended complaint on February 15,
2018 against all parties. Grace Hong and Pishon received service via PACER. Plaintiff
perfected service on Laurence Hong through certified mail on February 28, 2018. D.E. #50.
Defendants failed to answer both the initial and the amended complaints. Upon the CFTCâs
motion, the Clerk entered default against all of the Defendants on June 8, 2018 against all
parties. D.E. ## 59-61. As such, the well-pleaded allegations of Plaintiff's complaint and
amended complaint are taken as true against Defendants Pishon, Laurence Hong, and Grace
Hong.

The Court has reviewed and carefully considered the complaint, the amended complaint,
the Plaintiff's Motion for Default Judgment, including the Exhibits and the entire record in this
case, and the Court being otherwise advised in the premises, it is hereby:

ORDERED that the CFTCâs Motion for Default Judgment against Defendants Pishon,
Laurence Hong, and Grace Hong and Request for Entry of a Permanent Injunction and
Restitution against Defendants be GRANTED in all respects. Accordingly, the Court enters
findings of fact, conclusions of law, and an Order of Final Judgment against Defendants Pishon,
Laurence Hong, and Grace Hong and a Permanent Injunction and Restitution (âOrderââ)
pursuant to Sections 6c and 6d of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 13a-1, 13a-2 (2012), as set forth herein.

federal regulatory agency that is charged by Congress with the administration and enforcement
of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1-26 (2012), and the Regulations promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R.
Â§Â§1.1-190.10 (2017). The CFTC maintains its principal office at Three Lafayette Centre, 1155
21" Street NW, Washington, D.C. 20581.

2. Defendant Pishon Holding, LLC is a Washington limited liability company
with its last known place of business at 8918 24th Street NE Clyde Hill, WA 98004. Pishon
has never been registered with the Commission in any capacity.

3. Defendant Sung Hong a/k/a Lawrence or Laurence Hong is an individual who,
during the Relevant Period, resided in Bellevue, Washington. Laurence Hong has never been
registered with the CFTC in any capacity.

4. Defendant Hyun Joo Hong a/k/a Grace Hong is an individual who, during the
Relevant Period, resided either in Bellevue, Washington or in Clyde Hill, Washington. Grace
Hong is a founder, principal, manager, and/or officer of Pishon and was responsible for this
companyâs acts. Grace Hong was listed with the CFTC as a principal of Pishon Capital
Management LLC â a Washington limited liability company - from March 23, 2015 until
December 23, 2015. Other than this, she has never been registered with the CFTC.

B. Defendantsâ Fraudulent Solicitations

5. From at least September 1, 2015 through June 1, 2017, Laurence and/or Grace
Hong fraudulently solicited more than $11 million from customers for trading commodity
futures contracts (âfuturesâ) via Pishon. A portion of the $11 million was lost in trading and
some returned to customers. The remainder was misappropriated. In total, Defendants
misappropriated at least $1,259,317.77.

6. Upon instruction from Defendants, customers sent funds directly to Interactive
Brokers (âIBâ), a future commission merchant (âFCMâââ) that segregated the customer funds
into separate accounts. Each customer then provided Pishon with discretionary authority to
âbuy, sell or hold securities, cash or other investments for Clientâs account(s) at the sole
discretion of Advisor and without first consulting Client. Such securities may include, but are
not limited to, interests in futures, commodity derivatives, common or preferred stock,
convertible stocks or bonds, options, warrants, rights, corporate, municipal, or government
bonds, and notes or bills.â

7. A customer signed a trading authorization form that represented that Pishon
would act as Advisor and control the futures trading on behalf of the customerâs specific
trading accounts. This provided Defendants access to customer funds.

8. Defendants solicited customers at a religious gathering, on a YouTube video of
that gathering, in direct solicitations, and through written solicitations usually distributed via
electronic mail.

9. In August 2016, Laurence and Grace Hong spoke at a Shekinah Worship Center
conference event. This event was recorded and the resulting video was posted on YouTube. In
introducing the Hongs, a Shekinah Worship Center Pastor noted that Laurence Hong was a
micro-trader for a hedge fund and that he manages a little over $2 billion. The Pastor further
stated that Laurence Hong has a successful trading track record. As an example, the Pastor
explained, if you had given Laurence Hong $1 million in 2001, by 2011 you would have
$57 million.

10. Upon information and belief, Laurence and Grace Hong told the Pastor these

misrepresentations sometime before the conference event.

11. After hearing the Pastorâs statements, neither Grace nor Laurence Hong
corrected the misrepresentations.

12. These statements are false. In fact in 2008, as described below, Laurence Hong
was sentenced to a 33 month incarceration in connection with defrauding an individual in an
investment scheme and misappropriating his funds.

13. The misrepresentations made at the conference event were preserved in a
YouTube video. As a result of both the conference event and the YouTube video, several
customers opened futures trading accounts with Pishon as their ââadvisor.â

14. In addition to the church gathering and YouTube video, Laurence Hong made a
series of misrepresentations to one or more customers.

15. Laurence Hong told one or more customers that there would be no fees taken
other than from profits. However, IB trading records show fees being taken by Pishon even
when customer accounts were not profitable.

16. Laurence Hong told one or more customers that he runs a multi-billion dollar
fund. Laurence Hongâs statement that he managed billions is untrue. Defendants have
approximately $11 million under management.

17. Laurence Hong told one or more customers that he has been active trading since
1999 and was profitable during the 2008 financial crisis. This statement is untrue since as
Laurence Hong was incarcerated in 2008.

18. In their written solicitation materials to prospective customers, Defendants made
numerous false statements including: 1) Pishon only charges a performance fee when or if the

account is profitable; 2) Pishonâs fund is constituted so that 50% of the fund has a ârisk free
rate of return;â and 3) Grace Hong âmaintains her 65 (uniform investment advisor) securities
licenses [sic].â

19. Despite their representations in the written solicitation materials that customers
would only be charged a management fee if the account were profitable, Defendants buried a
clause in their customer investment agreements that permitted Pishon to be paid a 25%
performance fee based on the quarterly account value, regardless of whether the account is
profitable. The customer investment agreement was then provided to IB and provided a basis
for IB to permit Defendants to withdraw customer funds.

20. In fact, corporate banking records show that the âperformanceâ fee was
withdrawn from client accounts and paid to Pishonâs IB account. Money was then transferred
to Pishonâs bank account for Laurence and Grace Hongâs personal use.

21. In addition, Defendants guarantee of a risk free rate of return (for 50% of the
fund) is inherently fraudulent.

22. Moreover, there is no evidence that Grace Hong ever held a series 65 license.

23. Defendants also omitted to tell prospective and current customers that Laurence
Hong is a felon. In the criminal case United States v. Hong, Sung, âLawrenceâ Hong pled
guilty to wire fraud (pursuant to 18 U.S.C. $1343) in connection with an investment scheme that
defrauded an individual. In 2008, Hong was sentenced to 33 months in prison in connection
with his fraudulent scheme against his neighbor, and additionally ordered to pay $870,834.00 in

restitution. This amount included $215,000 related to a civil judgment concerning a fraud

perpetrated against members of a Bellevue, Washington church in which Hongâs mother was a
member.
C. Defendants Misappropriated Customer Funds
24. In addition to fraudulent solicitation, Defendants misappropriated more than
$1,259,317.77 in customer funds during the operation of Pishon. They did this in two ways.
First, they took commissions and fees based on trading in their customersâ futures accounts to
which they were not entitled. Second, they had customers send money directly to a Grace Hong
controlled bank account ostensibly for the purpose of trading futures on behalf of their
customers. Rather than trade these customer funds, Defendants used them for their personal
expenses.

Fees and Commissions

 

25. As described in paragraphs 15-16 and 28-29 above, based on Defendants
fraudulent representations and omissions, customers opened and funded 12 futures trading
accounts at Interactive Brokers (âIBâ) and funded these futures trading accounts with
$10,793,777.

26. As part of the fraudulently induced customer agreements entered into by
Defendantsâ customers and IB, customers âagreedâ that Defendants were entitled to a certain
percentage of trading profits.

27. From April 2016 until June 2017, Defendants lost approximately $2,563,555.61

trading customersâ futures accounts at IB.

28. Despite these losses and pursuant to the fraudulently induced customer
agreements, IB sent Defendants fees and commissions totaling $294,317.77. Defendants were
not entitled to these fees and commissions.

29. Also during this time period, customers withdrew monies or transferred their
accounts to other broker dealers. The total amount of customer funds returned to customers in
these two ways was $7,937,371.80.

30. In sum, Defendants misappropriated at least $294,317.77 by taking fees and
commissions to which they were not entitled.

Grace Hongâs Bank Accounts

 

31. Beginning in June 2016, some customers were told to direct their funds to one of
three Grace Hong controlled bank accounts for the purpose of trading futures. In total,
approximately $965,000 of customer funds was deposited directly into these accounts by
customers. However, despite Defendantsâ representations that these customer funds would be
used for trading, they were not.

32. Rather than trade customer funds, Laurence and Grace Hong spent the customer
funds on personal expenses or to support Defendantsâ lavish lifestyle.

33. Customers did not give Defendants authority or permission to spend their money
in this manner.

34. In summary, Defendants misappropriated approximately $965,000 in customer
funds that were deposited into Grace Hong controlled bank accounts for the purported purpose

of futures trading.

is engaging, or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a violation of the Act or any
rule, regulation, or order thereunder.

39. Defendants knowingly or recklessly made material misrepresentations and/or
omissions to induce members of the public to engage in commodity futures trading, including
but not limited to:

a. Laurence Hong manages a little over $2 billion;

b. Laurence Hong has a successful trading track record;

c. Defendants would not take any fees unless the trading account was
profitable;

d. Laurence Hong was profitable trading during the 2008 financial crisis;

e. Pishonâs fund is constituted so that 50% of the fund has a ârisk free rate of
return;â

f. Grace Hong maintains her 65 (uniform investment advisor) securities
license; and,

g. Defendants omitted to tell prospective and current customers that
Laurence Hong was incarcerated for 33 months on wire fraud charges.

AO. Defendants cheated and defrauded Pishon customers by misappropriating
customer funds to which they were not entitled. Defendants misappropriated more than
$1,259,317.77 in customer funds during the operation of Pishon.

a. First, they took commissions and fees based on trading in their customersâ
futures accounts to which they were not entitled. Despite customer trading
losses and pursuant to the fraudulently induced customer agreements, IB
sent Defendants fees and commissions totaling $294,317.77. Defendants
were not entitled to these fees and commissions.

b. Second, they had customers send money directly to a Grace Hong controlled bank
account ostensibly for the purpose of trading futures on behalf of their customers. In total,
approximately $965,000 of customer funds was deposited directly into these accounts by
customers. However, despite Defendantsâ representations that these customer funds would be
used for trading, they were not. Rather than trade these customer funds, Defendants used them
for their personal expenses.

C. Derivative Liability

Al. Under Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(a)(1)(B) (2012), and
Regulation 1.2, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.2 (2018), strict liability is imposed upon principals for the actions
of their agents. Laurence and Grace Hongâs actions were committed within the scope of their
employment with Pishon, and their operation of Pishonâs business. Thus, because Laurence and
Grace Hong committed the alleged violations while acting on behalf of Pishon, Pishon is liable
for Laurence and Grace Hongâs individual acts constituting violations of the Act and Regulations
pursuant to Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(a)(1)(B), and Regulation 1.2, 17 C.F.R.

Â§ 1.2 (2018).

If, ORDER FOR RELIEF

42. Based upon and in connection with the foregoing conduct, pursuant to Section 6c
of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2012), Defendants Pishon, Laurence Hong, and Grace Hong are
permanently restrained, enjoined and prohibited from directly or indirectly:

a. engaging in conduct in violation of 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6b(a)(1)(A) and (C);
