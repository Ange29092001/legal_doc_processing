COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF AND CIVIL
MONETARY PENALTIES
UNDER THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT

Plaintiff U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCFTCâ or âCommissionâ), by

and through its attorneys, alleges as follows:
I. SUMMARY

l. From at least until October 2010 to at least October 2015 (âRelevant Periodâ),
defendant eFloorTrade, LLC (âEFTâ) failed to keep and produce for inspection full, complete,
and systematic records of all transactions relating to its business in dealing in commodity
interests (specifically, commodity futures contracts) in violation of Section 4g(a) of the
Commodity Exchange Act (the âActâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6g(a) (2012) and Regulations 1.31(a)(1) and
(2), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.31 (a)(1) and (2) (2013), and Regulations 1.35(a)(1) and (3), 17 C.F.R. Â§
1.35(a)(1) and (3) (2013).

2. During the Relevant Period, EFT failed to prepare a written record of a customer

order immediately upon receipt of that order including the account identifier and an order

number and record thereon with a timestamp, to the nearest minute, of the date and time the
Case 1:16-cv-07544 Document1 Filed 09/27/16 Page 2 of 26

order was received in violation of Section 4g(a) of the Act,7 U.S.C. Â§ 6g(a) (2012) and
Regulation 1.35(b), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.35(b) (2013).!

3. Specifically, EFT failed to keep and produce for inspection the trading
instructions it electronically received for customers who subscribed to third party trading systems
for which EFT provided execution services. EFT also failed to prepare a written record of the
customer orders that it placed (filled, unfilled or canceled) as a result of the trading instructions
received, timestamped with the date and time to the nearest minute of when an order was
received. In addition, EFT failed to keep all emails relating to its business in dealing in
commodity interest transactions, For example, Mooreâs wife, who acted in the capacity ofa
compliance officer for EFT during the Relevant Period, used her personal email account to send
and receive emails related to EFTâs business of transacting commodity interest transactions and
these emails were not kept and maintained by EFT. Accordingly, these failures violated the
recordkeeping requirements of the Act and Regulations set forth above in paragraphs 1 and 2.

4, Defendant John Moore (âMooreâ) is a registered associated person (âAPâ),
designated as the Branch Office Manager of EFTâs main office in Orlando and is responsible for
supervising EFTâs employees and agents in all aspects of their business duties.

5. During the Relevant Period described herein, EFT and Moore failed to diligently
supervise the handling of customersâ trading accounts by EFT employees and agents.

Specifically, EFT and Moore failed to ensure that policies and procedures were in place to make

 

| Although Regulations 1.31 and 1.35 were amended several times during the Relevant Period,
these recordkeeping Regulations that are the subject of the violations alleged herein, existed in
substance throughout the Relevant Period [see paragraphs 45, 47-49 and 56 of the complaint],
with the exception of the Regulation 1.35(a)(1) which, in substance, was amended to include the
requirement to keep communications such as quotes, solicitations, bids, offers, instructions,
trading and prices that lead to the execution of a transaction in a commodity interest whether
communicated by electronic mail, mobile device or other digital or electronic media. This
amendment came into effect on January 2, 2013 [see paragraph 46 of the complaint).

2
Case 1:16-cv-07544 Document1 Filed 09/27/16 Page 3 of 26

and keep books and records that EFT is required to make and keep as a Commission registrant
and failed to adopt adequate procedures on how to handle its customersâ margin deficiencies.
For example, contrary to the Act and Regulations, EFTâs procedures did not require EFTâs
offices utilizing the firmâs electronic trading platform and/or the trading software provided by
the FCM carrying that customerâs account to make or maintain written records such as customer
order tickets with order numbers and timestamps. EFT and Moore also failed to ensure all
employees and agents followed internal policies and procedures established by EFT that required
EFT to sever its business relationship with a third party trading system provider when the
carrying firm ceased doing business with that provider. These supervision failures violated
Regulation 166.3, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 166.3 (2015) and also contributed to recordkeeping violations of
the Act and Regulations.

6. In sworn testimony before the Commission on September 18, 2015, in his role as
managing director, majority owner, registered AP and sole principal of EFT, Moore was
questioned about the books and records EFT makes and keeps in its ordinary course of its
business in dealing in commodity interests. In response to such questioning, Moore falsely
testified under oath that he or another EFT employee working under his direct supervision,
created and maintained spreadsheets relating to trades executed on behalf of customers whose
orders were generated from trading instructions received from third party trading system

providers. Moore knowingly or reasonably should have known that this sworn testimony to the

Commission was false and misleading, since Moore and EFT through their attorney subsequently

admitted that no such records were made or kept by EFT. Mooreâs actions violated Section

6(c)(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 9(2) (2012) which makes it illegal for any person to make a false

or misleading statement of material fact to the Commission if the person knew, or reasonably
Case 1:16-cv-07544 Document1 Filed 09/27/16 Page 4 of 26

should have known the statement to be false or misleading.

7. Accordingly, the CFTC brings this action pursuant to Section 6c of the Act,
7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2012), to enjoin Defendantsâ unlawful acts and practices and compel their
compliance with the Act and Regulations. In addition, the CFTC seeks civil monetary penalties,

disgorgement and such other equitable relief as this Court may deem necessary and appropriate.

II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

8. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 6c(a) of the Act,
7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(a) (2014), which authorizes the CFTC to seek injunctive relief against any
person whenever it shall appear that such person has engaged, is engaged, is engaging, or is
about to engage in any act or practice constituting a violation of any provision of the Act or any
rule, regulation, or order thereunder.

9. Venue properly lies with this Court pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act,
7 U.S.C. Â§ 13al1(e) (2014), in that Defendants have transacted and/or transact business in this
District and Defendantsâ acts and practices in violation of the Act and Regulations occurred, are
occurring, and/or are about to occur within this District. Defendants had and/or have customers
who reside within this District who have subscribed to third party trading systems for which EFT
provides trade execution services.

Ill. THE PARTIES

10. _â_â Plaintiff U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an independent

federal regulatory agency charged by Congress with the responsibility for administering and

enforcing the provisions of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1 et seq. (2014), and the Regulations
Case 1:16-cv-07544 Document 1 Filed 09/27/16 Page 5 of 26

promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1.1 et seq. (2015).

11. Defendant eFloorTrade, LLC is a Delaware limited liability company whose
main office is located at 255 S Orange Ave #1505, Orlando, Florida. EFT is a family business,
wholly owned and operated by Moore and members of his immediate family. EFT provides
trade execution services to customers located throughout the United States, including those who
reside in this District. EFT has been registered with the Commission as an introducing broker
(âIBâ) since April 3, 2000 (including a period during which it did business under the name Floor
Trade, Inc.).

12. Defendant John A. Moore resides in Orlando, Florida. Moore has been
registered with the Commission as an AP of EFT since April 2000 and listed as its sole principal.
Moore functions as EFTâs Chief Compliance Manager, Sales Supervisor, and is responsible on a
daily basis for reconciling prior dayâs executed transactions, ensuring EFT is accurately paid
commissions for the orders it places on behalf of its customers behalf, calculating required net
capital, and overseeing that dayâs trading. He is listed as the Branch Manager of the main office
in Orlando and is responsible for supervising EFTâs employees and agents in all aspects of their
business duties. He has been registered with the Commission as an AP and principal with
various Commission registrants since August 1988.

IV. FACTS
A. EFTâs Business

13. The majority of EFTâs business involves receiving trading instructions from third
party trading systems and placing buy and sell orders for commodity interest transactions on

behalf of its customers who have subscribed to certain third party trading systems. These

customers have granted EFT a letter of direction to place orders communicated by third party
Case 1:16-cv-07544 Document1 Filed 09/27/16 Page 6 of 26

trading system providers on their behalf and EFT charges customers a commission per
transaction for its execution services.

14, _ EFT electronically receives trading instructions for its customers through
TradeStation, an electronic trading platform, from third party trading systems. These
instructions will include the specific futures contract to be traded, type of order (limit or market),
and a stop price. For example, on July 30, 2011, Think LX Pro trading system from the system
provider Tradethink sent instructions at 8:10:48 am to buy at market, the September 2011 British
Pound futures contract traded on the CME, a board of trade located in the United States, with a
stop price of 1.6524. Moore also receives a text to his mobile phone with trading instructions
from certain trading systems. Moore and EFT failed to save any of these texts of trading
instructions.

15. EFT built software which receives these trading instructions to buy or sell a
specific futures contract and routes them on behalf of its customers to the futures commission
merchant (âFCMâ) carrying that customerâs account for execution.

B. Commissionâs Document Requests

16. | OnMarch 11, 2014 and October 23, 2015, the Division of Enforcement (the
âDivisionâ) requested, through a letter sent to Defendantsâ then attorney, that EFT produce for
inspection to the Division in its Eastern Regional Office in New York, New York, certain of the
books and records that EFT was required to make under the Act and Regulations. The books and

records requested were within the five year period that these records were required to be kept
under the Act and Regulations.

17. As part of its March 11, 2014, the Commission requested production of, among

other things, (i) written documentation of EFTâs operating policies or procedures, (ii) all reviews
Case 1:16-cv-07544 Document 1 Filed 09/27/16 Page 7 of 26

performed since January 1, 2012, to ensure compliance with EFTâs written policies and
procedures, (iii) account documentation for accounts over which EFT had a power of attorney,
letter of direction or otherwise granted permission to exercise trading authority over a customerâs
account, including but not limited to account opening documents, order tickets and account
statements, (iv) trading signals, performance results or written documentation relating to any
electronic trading system or trading platform for which EFT has trading authority pursuant to a
power of attorney, a letter of direction or was otherwise granted permission to trade, and (v) all
customer complaints or inquires received between January 1, 2012 and the date of the request
and the results of EFTâs investigation of those customer complaints or inquires. The
Commission also requested all account records, trading records, and correspondence and
litigation records relating to a lawsuit filed by a customer against EFT.

18. In response to the Commissionâs request for documents dated March 11, 2014,
EFT produced certain of the requested documents, but failed to provide any (i) trading signals
relating to any electronic trading system or trading platform for which EFT has trading authority
pursuant to a power of attorney, a letter of direction or was otherwise granted permission to
trade, and (ii) order tickets made by EFT as a result of the receipt of the trading signals.

19. _ As part of its request for documents dated October 23, 2015, the Commission
again requested the production of all âdocuments not previously produced to the Division which
are responsive to the Divisionâs previous request dated March 11, 2014 request.â In addition, the
Commission also requested the production of, among other things, (i) trading instructions or
signals received from a third party trading system specifying any commodity interest to be
bought or sold for a subscriberâs account, (ii) documents created or received when EFT executes

transactions for a subscriber following the trading instructions or signals received from a third
Case 1:16-cv-07544 Document 1 Filed 09/27/16 Page 8 of 26

party trading system. Such documents may include, but are not limited to, order tickets, trade
listings, trade confirmations, daily trade logs, customer complaints, or inquiries, (iii) documents
maintained by EFT documenting the execution of orders placed on behalf of customers who had
given EFT authorization to follow the trading instructions or trading signals of a third party
trading system, and (iv) any spreadsheet or other record created or maintained by EFT
documenting the trades it placed on behalf of customers who had given EFT authorization to
follow the trading instructions or trading signals of a third party trading system.

20. On November 12, 2015, Defendants responded to Commissionâs document
request dated October 23, 2015 through a letter sent by Defendantsâ attorney (âDefendantsâ
Letterâ) which produced certain documents, but failed to produce any of the documents
responsive to the Commissionâs request described above in paragraph 18. For those requests that
Defendant failed to produce documents, the Defendantsâ Letter provided a written response to
the Divisionâs request.

21. Defendantsâ attorney acted as Defendantsâ agent in submitting the Defendantsâ
Letter to the Division. Because the attorney was retained by Defendants, the attorney was acting
on behalf of the Defendants in making statements in the Defendantsâ Letter. In addition, the
Defendantsâ Letter stated that it was responding to a request sent to Defendants by the Division
seeking additional information from EFT. Further, Moore, on behalf of both EFT and himself,

provided the information in the Defendantsâ Letter to the attorney and reviewed the contents of
the Defendantsâ Letter prior to it being sent to the Division.

22. In response to the Divisionâs October 23, 2015 document request, the Defendants
stated in the Defendantsâ Letter that ââ[w]hen EFT executes transactions for subscribers of third

party tradirig systems, no document is created or received.â Defendants also stated in the
Case 1:16-cv-07544 Document1 Filed 09/27/16 Page 9 of 26

Defendantsâ Letter that âEFT does not maintain any documents regarding the handling of trade
orders, other than the procedures manualâ for customers who had given EFT authorizations to
follow the trading instructions or trading signals of a third party trading system. The Defendants
further stated in the Defendantsâ Letter that âEFT does not create or maintain any spreadsheets

relating to trades placed in accordance with a third party trading systems.â

Cc. Mooreâs Testimony Under Oath

23. On September 18, 2015, Moore appeared voluntarily before the Commission to
provide testimony under oath. He was represented by counsel. Prior to the start of his
testimony, Moore was provided with a document titled âStatement to Persons Providing
Information about Themselves to the Commodity Futures Trading Commissionâ (the
âStatementâ) which sets forth his legal rights and responsibilities as a person requested to supply
information voluntarily or as a person with recordkeeping obligations under the Act or
Regulations. In relevant part, the Statement advised Moore of the following:

âAny person who knowingly and willfully makes false or fraudulent statements,

whether under oath or otherwise, or falsifies, conceals or covers up a material

fact, or submits any false writing or document, knowing it to contain false,

fictitious or fraudulent information, is subject to the criminal penalties set forth in
18 U.S.C. Â§ 1001... ,

It shall also be unlawful for any person to make any false or misleading statement
of a material fact to the Commission . . . or to omit to state in any such statement
any material fact that is necessary to make any statement of a material fact made
not misleading in any material respect, if the person knew, or reasonably should
have known, the statement to be false or misleading, as set forth in Section 6(c)(2)
of the Commodity Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 9(2).â

24. At the opening of the record, Moore was administrated an oath by the court
reporter to testify truthfully and Moore swore or affirmed that he would testify truthfully. Under

oath and on the record, Moore then acknowledged that he read the Statement and had no

9
Case 1:16-cv-07544 Documenti Filed 09/27/16 Page 10 of 26

questions regarding his legal rights and responsibilities. He also testified that there was no
reason why he could not providing full, complete and truthful answers to the Divisionâs
questions.

25. Moore testified that during the Relevant Period, he was the managing director,
majority owner, registered AP, and sole principal of EFT. He further testified that he was
responsible for adopting and enforcing internal policies and procedures to ensure EFTâs
compliance with the Act, supervising EFTâs APs and employees and managing EFTâs day to day
operations. Moore also testified that as required by NFA rules, he reviewed EFTâs operations on
a yearly basis (according to the criteria set forth in NFAâs self-examination questionnaire) and
signed the questionnaire attesting to the fact that EFTâs internal procedures were adequate to
meet its regulatory responsibilities.

26. Moore testified that he knew that his wife (who acted in the capacity of
compliance officer for EFT during the Relevant Period) used her personal email account to send
and receive emails related to EFTâs business of transacting commodity interest transactions and
that these emails were not kept and maintained by EFT. During the Relevant period, Mooreâs
wife used her personal email address to correspond with at least one EFT customer and Moore
listed his wifeâs personal email address in the annual registration updates he filed with NFA as
the email address to use for any accounting or compliance issues related to EFT.

27. | Moore also testified that he and other employees and agents under his direct
supervision did not make and/or keep a written record of the customer orders placed with the
carrying FCM since they did not âhave enough time in the dayâ to prepare records of customersâ
orders and relied on the records made by the carrying FCM since the FCM maintained âa history

of time stamped orders when the order was received, filled, and hit the customer account.â

10
Case 1:16-cv-07544 Document1 Filed 09/27/16 Page 11 of 26

Moore testified that since he could access relevant records through the FCMâs website whenever
he wanted, there was no need for EFT to keep copies of these records. Notwithstanding Mooreâs
testimony, the records of the carrying FCM, however, did not include the date and time when

EFT received the trading instructions from the third party trading system, what those instructions

were and the time when EFT placed the customer order with the carrying FCM.

28. | Moore was asked if the trading signals were maintained by EFT and he testified
that the signals were displayed on a screen that EFT monitored and that these signals were only
preserved âon occasion sometimes.â He further testified that the signals were captured in
TradeStation but TradeStation had known âdata discrepancy problemsâ and âfutures contracts,
when it [futures contracts] rolls, it [TradeStation] changes their dataâ so that TradeStation data
isn't 100 percent accurate and changes.â

29. Moore further testified that he did not maintain the text messages containing the
trading instructions he received on behalf of EFTâs customers from third party system providers.

30. Moore made a false or misleading statement when he testified that EFT made and
kept an Excel spreadsheet listing the trades EFT placed on behalf of customers who subscribed
to third party trading systems. He also made a false or misleading statement when he testified
that the Excel spreadsheet was the sole record EFT made and kept of the futures orders placed on
behalf of customers who had given EFT authorization to follow the trading instructions or

trading signals of a third party trading system.

Question: Other than what's currently in the TradeStation account that you
are running, you don't separately maintain anything?

Answer: Yes, we do.

Question: How do you do that?

Answer: In an Excel spreadsheet.

Question: Whose responsibility is it to maintain that?

11
Case 1:16-cv-07544 Document1 Filed 09/27/16 Page 12 of 26

Answer: Between my son and I we both; I do some, he does some.
Question: And how often do you do it?
Answer: Every day.

Question: Okay, let me step back. A signal was generated in [third party
provider]âs system, you receive a text message; is that correct?

Answer: Correct.

Question: The signal also through your coding automatically places trades in
your customersâ accounts that are trading that system?

Answer: Correct.

Question: No separate order ticket or record is created outside the
TradeStation environment at that point?

Answer: The [FCMâs] time stamp order in the customer's account.

Question: But eFloorTrade doesn't create anything?

Answer: No.

Question: And eFloorTrade doesn't maintain anything? There is on the FCM
side, but there is nothing on your side?

Answer: The Excel spreadsheet.

Question: And there is the signal in the system, in the TradeStation that
generated a signal over to the FCM to execute the trades?

Answer: Correct.

Question: After that signal is done, how soon is that downloaded into the
Excel spreadsheet?

Answer: The next day.

31. | When further questioned about the Excel spreadsheet (referenced in paragraph 30
above), Moore made a false or misleading statement when he testified that either he or his son
âmanually input in the spreadsheets those trading systems that signal the day before, make sure
that those are the trades that went offâ and reflected âthe actual trade that occurred in the
customer accountâ and that this spreadsheet was used by him to reconcile the prior business
dayâs trading. Moore also made a false and misleading statement when he further testified that
he reviewed this spreadsheet daily and ensured that copies of this spreadsheet were electronically
maintained by EFT.

32. Moore knew or reasonably should have known at the time of his testimony under
oath that his statements about the Excel spreadsheet referenced in paragraphs 30 and 31 were

false and misleading. Contrary to Mooreâs testimony, the Defendantsâ Letter states that âEFT

12
Case 1:16-cv-07544 Documenti Filed 09/27/16 Page 13 of 26

does not create or maintain any spreadsheets relating to trades placed in accordance with a third
party trading systemsâ and that â[w]hen EFT executes transactions for subscribers of third party
trading systems, no document is created or received.â Mooreâs testimony is further contradicted
by the Defendantsâ Letter which states that âEFT does not maintain any documents regarding the

handling of trade orders, other than the procedures manualâ for these customers.

D. Defendantsâ Failure to Properly Supervise

33. Moore is a registered AP of EFT, is designated as a Branch Office Manager and is
a managing member, majority owner, and chief compliance officer of EFT. As a registered AP
and Branch Office Manager of EFTâs main office, Moore is responsible for supervising all
employees and agents, supervising sales solicitations, approving customer account forms,
monitoring trading activity to detect unusual or suspicious activity, reviewing and responding to
customer complaints, conducting training for staff and drafting EFTâs written policies and
procedures to ensure EFT complies with the Act and Regulations. Moore reviewed EFTâs
operations on a yearly basis and had not identified any issues with EFTâs policies or procedures.
In fact, Moore signed NFAâs annual self-examination questionnaire where he attested to the fact
that EFTâs written procedures were adequate to meet its regulatory responsibilities.

34, | EFT and Moore failed to design, implement, maintain, and enforce an adequate
program of supervision to meet their regulatory obligations. These supervision failures
contributed to EFTâs recordkeeping violations of the Act and Regulations. For example,
contrary to the Act and Regulations, EFTâs procedures did not require EFTâs offices utilizing the
firmâs electronic trading platform and/or the trading software provided by the FCM carrying that

customerâs account to maintain written records such as customer order tickets with preprinted

13
Case 1:16-cv-07544 Document1 Filed 09/27/16 Page 14 of 26

order numbers and timestamps.

35. Another example of EFT and Mooreâs failure to design, implement, maintain, and
enforce an adequate program of supervision is EFTâs failure to adopt written procedures
governing the handling of routine margin calls which occur when the carrying FCM demands
additional funds or securities be deposited in a trading account because the value of equity in the
account has fallen below a required minimum. Moore only developed such procedures after it
was sued by one of its customer for placing trades, not authorized by the customer and/or
generated from a the third party trading system subscribed to by that customer, in that customerâs
account to avoid a margin call.

36. | EFT and Moore also failed to perform their supervisory duties diligently by not
following the very procedures they had adopted. For example, EFT had a provision in its
Procedures and Operations Manual dated September 1, 2011, that âif an FCM ceases to do
business with any third-party trading system, EFT will also sever the relationshipâ with that
third-party trading system. Notwithstanding this policy, when EFT was notified on September
15, 2011, that an FCM severed its relationship with a certain third party trading system and
closed the accounts of EFT customers who subscribed to that system, EFT did not sever its
relationship with that system. Instead, EFT assisted those subscribers in opening accounts at
another FCM so that they could continue to trade pursuant to that third party trading system.
EFT violated its own policy so that it would not lose the commissions earned from subscribers to
that particular system, which comprised the vast majority of EFT customers. The next version of
the compliance manual dated March 2, 2012, changed this policy and gave EFT discretion
whether to terminate its business relationship with the third party trading system provider.

37. | EFT and Moore did not diligently oversee the activities of EFT employees and

14
Case 1:16-cv-07544 Document1 Filed 09/27/16 Page 15 of 26

agents under their supervision, nor did they act to ensure that employees under their supervision
complied with the Act and Regulations. Further, EFT and Moore did not enforce compliance

with EFTâs own policies and procedures.

Vv. VIOLATIONS OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT
COUNT ONE

FALSE OR MISLEADING STATEMENT TO THE COMMISSION
(VIOLATIONS OF 7 U.S.C Â§ 9(2))

38. The allegations of the foregoing paragraphs are incorporated herein by reference.

39. Section 6(c)(2) of the Act provides in pertinent part that it is unlawful âfor any
person to make any false or misleading statement of a material fact to the Commission. . . or to
omit to state in any such statement any material fact that is necessary to make any statement of
material fact made not misleading in any material respect, if the person knew, or reasonably
should have known, the statement to be false or misleading.â 7 U.S.C. Â§9(2) (2012).

40. _ As set forth above, Moore made false or misleading statements to the
Commission when he was testified under oath before the Commission about the books and
records EFT makes and keeps in its ordinary course of its business in dealing in commodity
interests. Moore also falsely testified that EFT made or kept an Excel spreadsheet listing the buy
or sell orders placed to trade a specific futures contract on behalf of customers who subscribed to
a third party trading system. Moore further testified falsely when he testified that he used this
Excel spreadsheet to reconcile the prior business dayâs trading and that he personally ensured
that copies of this spreadsheet were electronically stored by EFT.

41. | Moore knew or reasonably should have known that each of his statements was

false or misleading.

42. _ Each false, fictitious, fraudulent or misleading statement of material fact,
including but not limited to those specifically alleged herein, is alleged as a separate and distinct

violation of Section 6(c)(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§9(2) (2012).

FAILURE TO KEEP AND PRODUCE REQUIRED BOOKS AND RECORDS
(VIOLATIONS OF 7 U.S.C Â§ 4g(a) and 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1.31(a)(1) and (2); 1.35(a)(1) and (3))

43. The allegations of the foregoing paragraphs are incorporated herein by reference.

44. Section 4g(a) of the Act provides in pertinent part that every person registered as
an IB shall keep books and records pertaining to transactions and positions of customers in such
a form and for such period as may be required by the Commission; and shall keep such books
and records open to inspection by any representative of the Commission or the United States
Department of Justice. 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6g(a) (2012).

45. Regulation 1.35(a) provides in pertinent part that each IB shall keep full,
complete, and systematic records, together with all pertinent data and memoranda, of all
transactions relating to its business of dealing in commodity futures. Included among such
records are all orders (filled, unfilled, or canceled), copies of confirmations, copies of statements
of purchase and sale, and all other records, which have been prepared in the course of its

54. The allegations of the foregoing paragraphs are incorporated herein by reference.

55. Section 4g(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6g(a) (2012), provides that every person
registered as an IB âshall make such reports as are required by the Commission regarding the
transactions and positions of such person, and the transactions and positions of the customer

56. Regulation 1.35 specifically requires that each IB who receives a customer order
shall immediately upon receipt thereof prepare a written record of the order including the
account identification [except in certain circumstances related to bunched orders] and order
number and shall record thereon, by timestamp or other timing device, the date and time, to the
nearest minute, the order is received. During the Relevant Period, this legal requirement existed

conduct before October 1, 2012);

d. Regulation 1.35(b), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.35(b) (2013) (with respect to conduct on

or after February 19, 2013).

57. EFT violated Section 4g(a) of the Act and Regulation 1.35 when it failed to
prepare, immediately upon receipt, âa written record of the order including account identification
and order numberâ and ârecord thereon, by timestamp or other timing device, the date and time,
to the nearest minute, the order is receivedâ for its customers who subscribed to third party
trading systems.

58. | Moore controlled EFT and did not act in good faith or knowingly induced,
directly or indirectly, the acts constituting EFTâs violations alleged in this count. Moore is
therefore liable as a controlling person pursuant to Section 13(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13c(b)
(2012).

59. The foregoing acts, omissions, and failures of Moore and EFT employees
occurred within the scope of their employment, office or agency with EFT. Therefore EFT is
liable as a principal pursuant to Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(a)(1)(B) (2012) and
Regulation 1.2, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.2 (2015) for the acts, omissions, and failures of EFT employees,

FAILURE TO DILIGENTLY SUPERVISE
(VIOLATIONS OF REGULATION 166.3)

61. The allegations of the foregoing paragraphs are incorporated herein by reference.

62. Regulation 166.3, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 166.3 (2015), requires each Commission registrant,
except an AP who has no supervisory duties, to diligently supervise the handling of all
commodity interest accounts carried, operated, advised or introduced by the registrant and all
other activities of its partners, officers, employees and agents relating to its business as a
Commission registrant.

63. | EFT and Moore were each registered with the Commission during the Relevant
Period. During the relevant period, Moore had supervisory duties at EFT as a registered AP and
a Branch Office Manager of EFTâs main office. EFT and Moore violated Regulation 166.3, 17
C.F.R. Â§ 166.3 (2015), in that they, among other things, did not diligently supervise the handling
of commodity interest accounts and all other activities of EFTâs partners, officers, employees
and agents. EFT and Moore failed to design, implement, maintain, and enforce an adequate
program of supervision to meet its regulatory obligations and these supervision failures
contributed to its recordkeeping violations of the Act and Regulations.

64. Each failure to supervise, including but not limited to those specifically alleged
herein, is alleged as a separate and distinct violation of Regulation 166.3, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 166.3

(2015).
