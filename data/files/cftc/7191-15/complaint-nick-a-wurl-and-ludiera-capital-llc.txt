COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, CIVIL MONETARY PENALTIES,
AND OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF UNDER THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT

Plaintiff U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (Commission) alleges as follows:
1. SUMMARY

1. Since at least July 2014 through at least May 26, 2015 (the Relevant Period), Nick
A. Wurl (Wurl) and his company Ludiera Capital LLC (Ludiera) (together, Defendants) have
defrauded at least 46 individuals and entities who contributed more than $9 million to an
investment pool operated by Ludiera that trades commodity future contracts (futures) and options
on futures (options).

2. In approximately May 2013, Defendants established the Ludiera Diversified
Opportunity Portfolio L.P. (the Pool). Defendants subsequently marketed the Pool to
participants as a safe and well-capitalized limited partnership established to supply operating
capital to Ludiera for its purported physical commodity trading. In reality, the Pool was little
more than a shell company used to defraud Pool participants and enrich Defendants at their

expense.
Case: 1:15-cv-05585 Document #: 1 Filed: 06/23/15 Page 2 of 28 PagelD #:2

3. Defendants went to great lengths to convince Pool participants that Defendants
operated a well-capitalized, reputable, and established physical commodity trading firm. To that
end, Defendants solicited funds from individuals and entities for the represented purpose of
investing in their physical commodity trading business. In making these solicitations,
Defendants represented, among other things, that they were engaged in the purchase, transport,
and sale of physical commodities. Defendants characterized the investment opportunity as a âno
riskâ strategy and assured Pool participants that the worst potential outcome was no gain on their
investment.

4. This portrait of Defendants is a sham. In reality, Defendants never engaged in
physical commodity trading. Instead of using Pool participantsâ money to purchase, sell, and
transport commodities, Defendants diverted Pool participantsâ funds to their own bank and
trading accounts. Defendants then used the bulk of the Pool participantsâ fundsâover $6.8
millionâto trade futures and options, including futures and options on equity indices,
agricultural commodities, and energy commodities. Defendants also misappropriated over
$600,000 of Poo! participantsâ funds to pay their credit card debts, to make automobile purchases
and to use for additional items and expenses.

5. Through their trading of futures and options, Defendants lost more than $3.3
million of Pool funds. Defendants never disclosed to Pool participants that they used a
significant portion of Pool participant funds to trade futures and options. Defendants never made
any disclosures to Pool participants regarding the massive losses sustained by Defendants trading
futures and options with Pool funds. Further, Defendants affirmatively misrepresented to Pool

participants that Defendants were not engaged in the trading of futures and options.
Case: 1:15-cv-05585 Document #: 1 Filed: 06/23/15 Page 3 of 28 PagelD #:3

6. Additionally, to perpetuate their fraud, Defendants operated the Pool as a Ponzi
scheme through which they used Pool participant funds to pay other Pool participants a total of
approximately $1.8 million as redemptions.

7. Throughout the duration of the scheme, Defendants regularly prepared and
distributed to Pool participants false monthly account statements. These false monthly account
statements purport to reflect physical commodity transactions that never took place and falsely
represent growth in value of Pool participantsâ interests in the Pool. Defendants consistently
misrepresented to Pool participants, both orally and through these false account statements, that
Pool participantsâ interests in the Pool were continuing to grow significantly in value.

8. By the aforementioned conduct, and the conduct described herein, Defendants
have engaged, are engaging in, or are about to engage in practices that violate the provisions of
the Commodity Exchange Act (âActâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1 et seg. (2012), and Commission
Regulations (âRegulationsâ), 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1.1 ef seg. (2014). Specifically, they have engaged,
are engaging or are about to engage in acts or practices in violation of Sections 4b(a)(1)(A)-(C),
4c(b), 4k(2), 4m(1), 40(1), and 6(c)(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6b(a)(1)(A)-(C), 6c(b), 6k(2),
6m(1), 60(1), 9(1) (2012); and Regulations 4.20, 33.10, and 180.1, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 4.20, 33.10,
180.1 (2014)

9. Pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2012), the Commission
brings this action to permanently enjoin Defendantsâ unlawful acts and practices, to compel their
compliance with the Act and the Regulations thereunder, and to permanently enjoin them from
engaging in any commodity-related activity.

â10. When Wurl committed the acts, omissions, and failures described herein, he did

so within the scope of his agency, employment, and office with Ludiera; therefore, Wurlâs acts,
Case: 1:15-cv-05585 Document #: 1 Filed: 06/23/15 Page 4 of 28 PagelD #:4

omissions, and failures are deemed those of Ludiera pursuant to Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act,
7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(a)(1)(B) (2012), and Regulation 1.2, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.2 (2014).

11. At all times relevant to this Complaint, Wurl controlled Ludiera, directly or
indirectly, and did not act in good faith or knowingly induced, directly or indirectly, the acts of
Ludiera described herein; therefore, Wurl is liable for the violations by Ludiera of the Act and
Regulations described herein pursuant to Section 13(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13c(b) (2012).

12. Accordingly, pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2012), the
Commission brings this action to permanently enjoin Defendantsâ unlawful acts and practices
and to compel their compliance with the Act and Regulations and to further enjoin Defendants
from engaging in any commodity-related activity. In addition, the Commission seeks civil
monetary penalties and remedial ancillary relief, including, but not limited to, trading and
registration bans, restitution, disgorgement, rescission, pre- and post-judgment interest, and other
such relief as the Court may deem necessary and appropriate.

13. Unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, there is a reasonable likelihood that
Defendants will continue to engage in the acts and practices alleged in this Complaint, and
similar acts and practices, as more fully described below.

II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

14. The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 6c of the Act,

7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2012), because it appears to the Commission that Defendants have engaged,
are engaging, or are about to engage in conduct that constitutes a violation of the Act and the

Regulations.
Case: 1:15-cv-05585 Document #: 1 Filed: 06/23/15 Page 5 of 28 PagelD #:5.

15. Venue properly lies with the Court pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
Â§ 13a-1(e) (2012), in that Defendants reside and transact business in this District and acts and
practices in violation of the Act and Regulations have occurred within this District.

Ill. PARTIES

16.â Plaintiff U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an independent
federal regulatory agency that is charged by Congress with the administration and enforcement
of the Act and the Regulations promulgated thereunder. The Commission maintains its principal
office at Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21" Street NW, Washington, DC 20581.

17. Defendant Nick A. Wurl is a resident of Chicago, Illinois. Wurl owns Ludiera
and is the President, Director, Chairman, and Managing Member of Ludiera. At all times, and
with respect to all conduct described in this Complaint, Wurl has exercised sole ownership and
control over Ludiera. Wurl also has managed and directed other employees of Ludiera who
acted on Ludieraâs behalf. Wurl, either himself or through others acting at his direction, has
solicited customers for Ludiera; has prepared and distributed or has directed others to prepare
and distribute disclosure documents, transaction updates, marketing materials, and other
literature used to solicit customers for Ludiera; and has executed or directed others to execute
futures and options trades on behalf of Ludiera, all of which occurred within the scope of Wurlâs
agency, employment, or office with Ludiera. During the Relevant Period, Wurl was an
associated person (AP) of Ludiera, though Wurl has never been registered with the Commission
in any capacity.

18. Defendant Ludiera Capital LLC is a Delaware limited liability company with its
principal place of business at 733 N. LaSalle St., 3â Floor, Chicago, IL 60654. Wurl is the

owner, President, Director, Chairman, and Managing Member of Ludiera. Ludiera is engaged in
Case: 1:15-cv-05585 Document #: 1 Filed: 06/23/15 Page 6 of 28 PagelD #:6

a business that is of the nature of a commodity pool, investment trust, syndicate, or similar form
of enterprise, and, in connection therewith, solicited, accepted, or received from others, funds,
securities, or property, for the purpose of trading in commodity interests. During the Relevant
Period, Ludiera was the commodity pool operator (CPO) for the Pool, though Ludiera has never
been registered with the Commission in any capacity.

IV. FACTS
A. Background Information Regarding Defendants and the Pool

19. On March 13, 2013, Wurl formed Ludiera in Delaware as a limited liability
company.

20. Atall times during the Relevant Period, Wurl owned Ludiera and served as its
President, Director, Chairman, and Managing Member.

21. According to its website, Ludiera was founded in 2009 and has since âgrown from
being a North America niche player in derivatives trading to a highly diversified commodity
trading and investment management company integrating physical commodity trading, real asset
management, and logistics services into one financially sound entity.â

22.  Ludiera purports to trade physical commodities, including agricultural and energy
products. Ludiera claims that, in conjunction with its physical commodity trading activities, it
* can provide âcomplex hedging structures as a part of each physical contract to provide customers
with enhanced price risk mitigation.â

23. On May 15, 2013, Defendants created the Pool and named Ludiera as the Poolâs

general partner.
Case: 1:15-cv-05585 Document #: 1 Filed: 06/23/15 Page 7 of 28 PagelD #:7

24. Defendants created the Pool purportedly to provide operating capital to Ludiera in
furtherance of its purchase, sale, and transport of commodities around the world through its
network of trading counterparties.

25. The Poolâs Private Placement Memoranda dated July 8, 2014 and October 1, 2014
(together, the PPMs) describe the Pool as a âphysical commodity trading and asset management
company.â The PPMs claim that the Pool leverages âthe network of commodity buyers and
processing firms with the goal of providing reliable commodity supplies at competitive prices to
end users around the world.â

B. Defendantsâ Fraudulent Solicitation of Pool Participants

26. Throughout the Relevant Period, Defendants, acting directly or through their
agents, employees, or officers, solicited approximately $9 million from at least 46 individuals
and entities for the represented purpose of purchasing, selling, and transporting physical
commodities.

27. Defendants solicited existing and prospective participants of the Pool through in-
person meetings, phone calls, and email communications.

28. Defendants provided marketing materials for Ludiera and for the Pool to existing
and prospective participants of the Pool. Wurl personally orchestrated and distributed these
marketing materials and was responsible for Ludieraâs solicitation practices.

29. Defendants utilized the mail and/or other means or instrumentalities of interstate
commerce to (1) distribute the PPMs to existing and prospective participants of the Pool;

(2) distribute transactional statements to participants; (3) portray Ludieraâs purported business

model and strategy to the public via its website; and (4) provide information to existing and
Case: 1:15-cv-05585 Document #: 1 Filed: 06/23/15 Page 8 of 28 PagelD #:8

potential participants of the Pool regarding the purported business strategy, activity, and

profitability of the Pool.

30.

Throughout the Relevant Period, Defendants made numerous misrepresentations

of material fact to existing and potential Pool participants to convince them to invest with

Defendants and to remain invested with Defendants. Specifically, Defendants falsely told

existing and prospective Pool participants that:

31.

a.

Defendants would invest Pool participantsâ funds in the buying and selling of
physical commodities;

Defendants were in the business of âsourc[ing] and mov[ing] physical
commodities from areas of high supply to areas of high demand through its
network of end users and both United States and foreign domiciled entitiesâ;
Defendantsâ trading in physical commodities was generating profits for Pool
participants;

Defendants were not engaged in the trading of futures or options;

Defendants had established a segregated bank account with J.P. Morgan Chase in
the name of the Pool into which the participantsâ funds would be deposited;

Pool participantsâ investment with Defendants was low-risk, if not entirely risk-
free; and

The worst potential outcome for Pool participants was a 0% return on investment.

Defendants concocted elaborate and false stories about physical commodity

transactions in order to convince participants to invest in their scheme. For example, Wurl

falsely described to a then-prospective Pool participant a method of doing business that he

claimed Defendants utilized:
Case: 1:15-cv-05585 Document #: 1 Filed: 06/23/15 Page 9 of 28 PagelD #:9

32.

The way we earn money for our partners is [] by negotiating an agreement
to buy the requested physical commodity at a given price from one of our
origination facilities and at the same time we sell the same commodities
on contract to one of our contacts who is looking to purchase . . . [.] When
they buy, they transfer the whole amount of money that weâre due to an
escrow account in Ludiera Capitalâs name so that we can verify that the
funds exist before we sell the product. After weâve determined the
location that we are buying the commodities from, we then locate shipping
capacity (either a train, barge, or ocean faring vessel) and arrange for the
product to be picked up at the location where we bought it. When our
contracted transportation picks the product up, our insurance policy,
underwritten by the United States Export Import Bank (backed by the
United States Government) protects Ludiera on the full value of the
product [] in the event that some part of the transaction does not go as
planned ... When the product arrives to the buyerâs port, the full value of
the escrow account is released to Ludiera Capital and the profit on the
transaction is divided amongst our partners.

* * *

In a worst case scenario, if no trading opportunities exist in the world, we
would simply wait. Our worst possible outcome would be a return of 0%
in a year (assuming no deals were available to be made, an occurrence that
has not happened over a prolonged period in the history of global trade).

Defendantsâ misrepresentations caused participants to invest, invest additional

money, and convince others to invest with Defendants.

33.

Throughout the Relevant Period, Defendants failed to disclose material facts to

the Poolâs participants, including that:

34.

a.

A significant portion of participantsâ funds would be used to trade futures and
options;

Defendants were sustaining significant losses trading futures and options; and
There is risk, including the risk of loss of principal, associated with the trading of
futures and options.

Contrary to Defendantsâ representations regarding their operations, at no time

were they engaged in the purchase, sale, or transportation of physical commodities. Instead,
Case: 1:15-cv-05585 Document #: 1 Filed: 06/23/15 Page 10 of 28 PagelD #:10

Defendants utilized Pool participant funds for speculative trading in futures and options using
accounts in Wurlâs and Ludieraâs names. Further, Defendants misappropriated Pool participant
funds for their own use, as described below.

35. Contrary to Defendantsâ representations, Defendants also failed to operate the
Pool as a separate legal entity. In particular, Defendants never opened a separate bank account
for the Pool as they claimed and deposited Pool participant funds directly into Ludieraâs account,
where it was then subsequently transferred to trading accounts in the names of Ludiera and Wurl,
as well as Wurlâs personal bank account.

36. Defendants made all of these false statements to Pool participants and prospective
Pool participants knowingly or with reckless disregard for the truth.

C. Defendants Commingled and Misappropriated Poo] Funds

37. The Pool was little more than a shell company used as a marketing device for
soliciting contributions of capital. The Pool had no independent function or capitalization
separate and apart from Ludiera itself, or even its own bank account.

38. | Defendants deposited the Pool participantsâ funds into a checking account in the
name of Ludiera at Bank A (the Ludiera bank account). Wurl is the sole signatory on the
Ludiera bank account.

39. Defendants never used any Pool participantsâ funds for the purchase, sale, or
transport of physical commodities.

40. Instead, Defendants transferred the bulk of Pool participantsâ funds from the
Ludiera bank account to, and between, other bank and trading accounts in the name of Ludiera or

Wurl:

10
Case: 1:15-cv-05585 Document #: 1 Filed: 06/23/15 Page 11 of 28 PagelD #:11

a. Defendants made approximately $1.4 million in net transfers of Pool
participantsâ funds from the Ludiera bank account to Wurlâs personal bank account at

Bank A. Wurl then made approximately $1.2 million in net transfers of those funds to his

personal account at Futures Commission Merchant (FCM) A, where he lost the funds

trading primarily futures and options.
b. Defendants transferred approximately $5.6 million in Pool participantsâ
funds from the Ludiera bank account to Ludieraâs trading accounts at FCM A and

FCM B, as well as to invest in a limited partnership interest with a hedge fund.

Defendants lost approximately $2.1 million in those accounts by trading primarily futures

and options. Collectively, approximately $3.5 million in Pool participantsâ funds,

remains in Ludieraâs trading accounts.

41. During the Relevant Period, Defendants spent at least $500,000 of Pool
participantsâ funds to pay for Ludieraâs credit card debts, automobile purchases, and additional
items and expenses.

42. During the Relevant Period, Wurl spent at least $100,000 of the Pool
participantsâ funds for his own personal use, including payments totaling at least $68,000 for his
credit card debts.

43. To disguise their trading losses and misappropriation, Defendants distributed a
sum of approximately $1.8 million to Pool participants as redemptions, i.e. "Ponzi payments,"
when in fact the majority of these funds consisted of other Pool participants' principal.

44. Defendants told pool participants that Ludiera would charge either a one percent
or half a percent annual âmanagement feeâ based on the total Pool assets. Defendants never

attempted to abide by this fee structure, however, and treated the entirety of Pool participantsâ

11
Case: 1:15-cv-05585 Document #: 1 Filed: 06/23/15 Page 12 of 28 PagelD #:12

contributions as available for their use in Ludieraâs and Wurl's futures and options trading
accounts, as well as for their personal use.

45. Defendants committed these acts of misappropriation knowingly or with reckless
disregard for the truth.

D. False Statements and Documents

46. Defendants created, distributed, or otherwise utilized with existing and potential
Pool participants several types of documents that furthered their fraudulent scheme, including
fake audited financial statements for Ludiera and its subsidiaries that purported to be conducted
by a top international accounting firm; fake bank account statements; and fake statements
documenting Ludieraâs purchase, sale, and transport of commodities.

47, Defendants created, distributed or otherwise utilized these documents in an effort
to convince existing and potential Pool participants of the legitimacy and profitability of
Defendantsâ operations. For instance, Defendants used several fabricated documents to convince
existing and potential Pool participants to contribute to the Pool, including:

a. Ludiera bank statements reflecting transactions in the range of $30-40 million per
month;

b. A document purportedly reflecting a grain purchase by Ludiera on October 19,
2014 of 1.75 million bushels of soybeans at $10.85 per bushel and its shipment to
Tokyo, Japan;

c. A document purportedly reflecting a sale by Ludiera on October 31, 2014 of
720,000 metric tons of soybeans for shipment from the United States to China;

d. An âEscrow Agreementâ dated April 10, 2013 between LUDIERA CAPITAL,

LLC and C[redacted]RP TRUSTEE COMPANY LIMITED; C[redacted]NK.

12
Case: 1:15-cv-05585 Document #: 1 Filed: 06/23/15 Page 13 of 28 PagelD #:13

N.A.; and C[redactedJNK INTERNATIONAL PLC governing custody of
Ludieraâs contribution of the âestimated transaction value of commodities.â

48. | These documents were presented to participants and potential participants during
face-to-face meetings, as well as through emails sent by Defendants.

49. Defendants also sent fake transaction statements to Pool participants by email,
generally monthly to bi-monthly, in conjunction with the purported completion of transactions
by Ludiera. The transactional statements represented that they were statements of âTransaction
History â Physical Commodity Trading Fund.â The transactional statements identified the
number of shares purportedly held by the respective Pool participant, consistently showing
increases in the share value of the respective Pool participant.

50. The transactional statements contained information purportedly showing
transactions associated with the physical purchase, transportation, and sale of commodities,
including noting deductions for the price of the commodity purchased, insurance, shipping
services, and tax withholding, as well as credits for the sale price-of the commodity upon
purported delivery. All of these statements were created by Defendants and all were completely
false. Defendants did not buy, transport, or sell physical commodities. Likewise the associated
entries for insurance on commodity transport, transportation costs, or taxes withheld were
completely false.

Sl. Moreover, the Pool participantsâ investment did not increase-in value. To the
contrary, Defendantsâ trading in futures and options resulted in trading losses of approximately

$3.3 million and experienced additional losses on account of Defendantsâ misappropriation.

13
Case: 1:15-cv-05585 Document #: 1 Filed: 06/23/15 Page 14 of 28 PagelD #:14

52. Participants relied on the false information contained in these statements in
deciding to initially invest, to make additional investment, and/or to recommend to others that
they also invest.

53. Defendants created, distributed, or otherwise utilized all of the false documents
described herein knowingly or with reckless disregard for the truth.

omissions, and/or failures are deemed to be those of Ludiera pursuant to Section 2(a)(1)(B) of
the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(a)(1)(B) (2012), and Regulation 1.2, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.2 (2014).
