entry of the following Findings of Fact, Conclusion of Law, permanent injunction, and equitable
relief pursuant to Section 6(c) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(2012), as set forth herein,

A. Bindings of Fact
i, The Parties to This Consent Order

14, Plaintiff U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an independent
federal regulatory agency that is charged by Congress with the administration and enforcement
of the Act, 7 U.S.C, Â§Â§ 1 ef seq., and the Commission Regulations promulgated thereunder,

17 CER. Â§Â§ 1.1 ef seg. The Commission maintains its principal office at Three Lafayette
Centre, 1155 21" Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20581.

15. Defendant Joseph F. Welsh IL resides in Northport, New York, From at least
June 2006 through May 2008 (the Relevant Period), Welsh was an associated person (AP) of MF
Global, Inc., a registered futures commission merchant (FCM) with its principal place of

business in New York, New York, At all times during the Relevant Period, as an AP of MF

 

 

 
Cassell decors 7 Sawer Deeanienn106?1 Aerecoeerd4ihs Aeagecscifit

Global, Welsh had the responsibility for, among other things, Ã©ntering orders for palladium and
platinum futures contracts on behalf of Christopher Louis Pia (Pia), a portfolio manager for
Moore Capital Management LLC (Moore Capital).

2, Other Relevant Individual

16. Chvistopher Louis Pia resides in North Castle, New York. During the Relevant
Period, Pia served as a portfolio manager of Moore Capital, which was a registered commodity

trading advisor (CTA). Pia was formerly registered as an AP of Moore Capital.

3. The New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) Palladium and Platinum
Futures Contracts

17, During the Relevant Period, palladium and platinum futures contracts traded on
the NYMEX, a contract market designated by the Commission for trading commodity futures
contracts. Both the NYMEX palladium and platinum futures contracts may be traded on the
NYMEX trading floor (also referred to as the trading pit) by open outery trading, with palladium
futures contracts trading from 8:30 a.m, to 1:00 p.m, Eastern Standard Time (EST) and platinum
futures contracts trading from 8:20 a.m. to 1:05 p.m. EST. Both NYMEX palladium and
platinum futures contracts also may be traded electronically on Globex, the Chicago Mercantile
Exchangeâs electronic trading platform, Sunday through Friday from 6:00 p.m. to 5:15 p.m, EST
with a 45 minute break between 5:15 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. EST. During the Relevant Period, the

majority of trades in NYMEX palladium and platinum futures contracts were executed on

Globex, rather than in the trading pit.

18. During the Relevant Period, the settlement prices of both the NYMEX palladium
and platinum futures contracts were calculated based on the volume-weighted average price of
all transactions conducted both on the trading floor and on Globex, during the two-minute

closing period for the contracts, The closing period for trading palladium futures contracts is
CasBelT2<cMOERFSaVAPY DecarisanlOG?l ASRBHOISIO4AES Heyqne Gaile

from 12:58 p.m. to 1:00 p.m. EST, and the closing period for trading platinum futures contracts
is from 1:03 p,m, to 1:05 p.m. EST. Globex and the trading pit trade side-by-side through the
close. Trading continues on Globex after the close of trading in the pit.

19, âTrading in both contracts was relatively illiquid, and Welshâs trading in both
futures contracts on the close on behalf of Pia frequently accounted for a significant portion of
the volume. Welshâs tracing strategy took advantage of these key characteristics of the
palladium and platinum futures marketsâthinly traded, illiquid, and volume-weighted average
settlement price calculationsââto attempt to manipulate the daily settlement prices.

4. Welsh Attempted to Manipulate the Prices of NYMILX Palladium and
Platinum Futures Contracts

20, During the Relevant Period, Pia or his execution clerks entered orders to Welsh
with instructions to exert upward pressure on the prices of NYMEX palladium and platinum
futures contracts, While employed as an associated person at MF Global, Welsh engaged in a
trading strategy in an attempt to manipulate upward the settlement prices of the palladium and
platinum futures contracts.

21, During the Relevant Period, Welsh placed Piaâs market-on-close (MOC) buy
orders in palladium and platinum futures contracts through a NYMEX floor clerk. Piaâs buy
orders were relatively large orders for the relatively illiquid palladium and platinum futures
contract markets. Typically, Piaâs orders constituted a large percentage of the volume of trading
on the close. Welsh routinely submitted Piaâs MOC buy orders in palladium and platinum
futures contracts to a floor broker by telephone over a recorded line. Welsh placed MOC orders

with the floor clerk with directions that indicated that he wanted to push the settlement prices

higher.

 

 

 

 

 
Cassell 2ccoter Saver Deeoieaen0641 AaRsnus6/04i65 FPaige 7cof i

22. To effectuate the manipulative scheme, Welsh waited until the last five or ten
seconds of the closing periods of platinum and palladium futures contract trading to place Piaâs
buy orders with a floor clerk who worked in the NYMEX trading pit. Welsh engaged in this
trading strategy throughout the Relevant Period and did so with the intent to manipulate the

prices of platinum and palladium futures contracts, including the settlement prices of those

contracts,
