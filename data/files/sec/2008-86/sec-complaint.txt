Defendants.

COMPLAINT
The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (âCommissionâ) files this suit
against Defendants Willbros Group, Inc. (âWillbros Groupâ), Jason Steph (âStephâ), Gerald
Jansen (âJansenâ), Lloyd Biggers (ââBiggersâ) and Carlos Galvez (âGalvezâ) and would
respectfully show the Court as follows:
SUMMARY
1. This action arises from multiple violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
(âFCPAâ) and the antifraud, books and records and internal control provisions of the federal
securities laws by Willbros Group and certain of its former employees.
2. From at least 2003 through early 2005, Willbros Group, through acts taken by
various employees and officers of certain of its affiliates, violated the FCPA by authorizing

bribery schemes to make corrupt payments to foreign officials in Nigeria to assist in obtaining

SEC v. Willbros Group, Inc., et al.
COMPLAINT

and retaining business for Willbros Group and its subsidiaries. These employees and officers
have since resigned or were terminated as employees and include the former President of the
companyâs subsidiary Willbros International (âFormer President of Willbros Internationalâ) and
Jason Steph, a former general manager of one of the companyâs Nigerian subsidiaries. In
Nigeria, the scheme entailed authorizing the payment of over $6 million in bribes to various
officials to obtain at least two significant contracts. From these two contracts, Willbros Group
realized approximately $8.9 million in net profits.

3. Similarly, in Ecuador, the Former President of Willbros International
orchestrated, in violations of the FCPA, a promise to pay $300,000 in bribes to officials of
PetroEcuador, an oil and gas company wholly-owned by the government of Ecuador, and its
subsidiary, PetroComercial. The bribes were made to influence the awarding of a contract that
ultimately generated total revenues exceeding $3 million.

4, In addition, certain former employees of Willbrosâ subsidiaries employed a long-
running fraudulent scheme to use the companyâs petty cash accounts in Nigeria to make a variety
of corrupt payments to Nigerian tax and court officials. Through this scheme, the employees and
officers caused Willbros Group to violate the FCPA, and the books and records and internal
control provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ). In turn, Steph and
Jansen aided and abetted violations of the FCPA and the books and records and internal controls
provisions of the Exchange Act. Biggers, through his part in the scheme, aided and abetted
violations of the FCPA and the books and records provisions of the Exchange Act.

5. Separately, Willbros Group, through certain of its former employees, including
the Former President of Willbros International and Galvez, engaged in a fraudulent scheme to
minimize the tax obligations of its subsidiary operating in Bolivia. This scheme involved the

SEC v. Willbros Group, Inc., et al.
COMPLAINT
Page-2
Case 4:08-cv-01494 Document 1 Filed 05/14/2008 Page 3 of 25

acquisition and use of falsified invoices that allowed the company to claim inflated offsets to its
âvalue-added taxesâ (âVATâ) obligation. This scheme resulted in material misstatements in the
financial statements Willbros Group included within certain Commission filings. As a result of
these material misrepresentations, Willbros Group violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of
1933 (âSecurities Actâ) and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder,
along with the books and records, internal controls and reporting provisions of the Exchange Act.
Galvez, through his contributions to the scheme, illegally falsified books and records and aided
and abetted Willbros Groupâs violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and the books and
records, internal controls and reporting provisions of the Exchange Act.

6. The Commission, in the interest of protectirig the public from any further illegal
activity, brings this action against the Defendants seeking permanent injunctive relief to prevent
future violations of the federal securities laws and, with regard to Defendants Steph, Jansen and
Galvez, civil monetary penalties.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

7. This court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Exchange Act Sections
21(d)(3) and 27 [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78u(d)(3) and 78aa]. Defendants, directly and indirectly, made
use of the mails and of the means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce in connection
with the acts, practices and courses of business described in this Complaint. Venue is proper
because many of the transactions, acts, practices and courses of business described below
occurred within the jurisdiction of the Southern District of Texas.

DEFENDANTS

8. Willbros Group, Inc., an international oil and gas pipeline company, is a

corporation organized under the laws of the Republic of Panama. Until 2000, it had its

Case 4:08-cv-01494 Document1 Filed 05/14/2008 Page 4 of 25

administrative headquarters in Tulsa, Oklahoma; in 2000, it moved its administrative

headquarters to its current location, Houston, Texas. Willbros Group, which became a public
company in 1996, has a class of securities registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act
and its shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange and is therefore an âissuerâ as that
term is used in the FCPA (15 U.S.C. Section 78dd-1(a)). |

9. Jason Edward Steph is a citizen of the United States and a former employee of
Willbros International, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Willbros Group. Steph was employed by
Willbros International from approximately 1998 to April 2005, when he resigned. He served
as the General Manager-Onshore in Nigeria for Willbros International from 2002 to April
2005.

10. Gerald Jansen is a Canadian national who formerly worked for Willbros
International in Nigeria from approximately 1993 to 1995 and again from 1998 through May
2005, when his employment was terminated. His most recent position with the company was
Administrator and General Manager - Finance for Willbros International.

11. Lloyd Biggers is a citizen of the United States who formerly worked for
Willbros International. He was assigned to Nigeria from approximately 1995 through his
termination as an employee in April 2005.

12. Carlos Galvez is a citizen of the United States who formerly worked in an
accounting and administrative supervisory role for Willbros International in connection with
the companyâs operations in Bolivia. His employment terminated in 2005.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND
Willbros and Its Operation in Nigeria, Ecuador, and Bolivia

13. During the relevant time period, Willbros Group conducted its operations
outside of North America through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Willbros International, Inc.
Like Willbros Group, Willbros International is incorporated in Panama and maintained its

administrative headquarters in Tulsa until 2000, when it moved to Houston.

14. Until it sold its Nigerian assets in February 2007, the company had conducted
business in Nigeria for over 40 years â primarily through three affiliates:- Willbros West
Africa, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Willbros International; Willbros Nigeria, Ltd., a
majority-owned subsidiary of Willbros West Africa; and Willbros Offshore Nigeria, Inc., a
majority-owned subsidiary of Willbros West Africa. Before the sale of Nigerian assets in
2007, the companyâs operations in Nigeria frequently represented a sizable percentage of the
companyâs global revenues. In 2004, for example, the Nigerian operations produced roughly
25% of the companyâs global revenue.

15. During the relevant time period, Willbros Group conducted business in
Ecuador through a subsidiary of Willbros International, known as Willbros Servicios Obras y
Sistemas S.A. (âWillbros Ecuadorâ). In 2004, the company, through Willbros Ecuador,
undertook a project called the Proyecto Santo Domingo. The client on this project was
PetroComercial, a subsidiary of PetroEcuador. PetroEcuador is Ecuadorâs state-owned oil and
gas company.

16. During the relevant time period, Willbros Group conducted business in Bolivia
through a subsidiary of Willbros International, known as Willbros Transandina. In late 2001,
the company, through Willbros Transandinaâs participation in a joint venture, obtained a 59
million dollar contract with a foreign consortium to construct a pipeline in Bolivia (the
âYacuiba-Rio Grande projectâ). Work on this project commenced in 2002 and was
substantially complete by 2003. Contract resolution and settlement of contract variations were

not finalized until 2004.

Bribery Scheme in Nigeria

17. Beginning in at least 2003, Willbros Group, acting through the Former President
of Willbros International, Steph and others, designed and implemented schemes to help Willbros

Group and its affiliates obtain at least two significant contracts in Nigeria: an onshore project

SEC v. Willbros Group, Inc., et al.
COMPLAINT
Page-5
Case 4:08-cv-01494 Document 1 Filed 05/14/2008 Page 6 of 25

known as the the Eastern Gas Gathering Systems project (âEGGSâ project) and a separate
offshore contract (âthe Nigerian Offshore Contractâ). These projects were to be completed on
behalf of two different joint ventures. Each joint venture was majority-owned by Nigerian
National Petroleum Corporation (âNNPCâ), an arm of the Nigerian government, and each had an
operator that was a subsidiary of a major multi-national oil company.

18. The EGGS and Nigerian Offshore Contract projects: generated cumulative
revenue to Willbros Group of approximately 487 million dollars and net profits of approximately
$8,910,000.

19. To pursue certain projects in Nigeria, Willbros West Africa formed a joint venture
consortium with a Nigerian subsidiary of a German engineering and construction company (âthe
Willbros Nigeria Consortiumâ). In December 2003, the Willbros Nigeria Consortium submitted
a commercial proposal seeking to be awarded some or all of the EGGS project, a natural gas
pipeline system. The project contemplated two primary phases, referred to as EGGS Phase 1 and
EGGS Phase 2. EGGS Phase 1 involved engineering, procurement and construction (âEPCâ) of
a pipeline and included an optional scope of work for the application of a coating to the pipeline
(âEGGS Coatingâ). EGGS Phase 2 was another optional scope of work within the EGGS Phase
1 proposal involving the construction of a second pipeline.

20. The commercial proposal was submitted to the operator of a joint venture that is
controlled by NNPC, an arm of the Nigerian government, and its subsidiary, the National
Petroleum Investment Management Services (âNAPIMSâ). In this complaint, the joint venture
client related to the EGGS project will be referred to as the âNigeria Joint Venture;â the operator

of Nigerian Joint Venture will be referred to as âJoint Venture Operator;â and the employees,

SEC v. Willbros Group, Inc., et al.
COMPLAINT
Page-6
Case 4:08-cv-01494 Document1 Filed 05/14/2008 Page 7 of 25

agents, and officials of the Joint Venture Operator, the Nigerian Joint Venture, NNPC, and
NAPIMS will be referred to collectively as âNigerian officials.â

21. In July 2004, after approval by NNPC and NAPIMS, the Willbros Nigeria
Consortium and the Joint Venture Operator (acting on behalf of the Nigeria Joint Venture)
executed the EGGS Phase | contract. The contract included the consortiumâs offer to perform
the EGGS Coating and EGGS Phase 2 optional scopes of work. In August 2004, again after
approval from NAPIMS and NNPC, the Nigeria Joint Venture awarded the EGGS Coating work
to the Willbros Nigeria Consortium. The Willbros Nigeria Consortium, ultimately, did not
obtain the EGGS Phase 2 optional scope of work, despite efforts in late 2004 and early 2005 to
procure it.

22. âIn roughly late 2003, prior to and during the EGGS project bidding process, the
Former President of Willbros International and Steph, acting on behalf of Willbros Group,
plotted with certain employees of Willbros West Africaâs joint venture partner in the Willbros
Nigerian Consortium, to make more than $6 million in payments to Nigerian officials, a Nigerian
political party and an official in the executive branch of Nigeriaâs federal government. These
payments were intended to help the Willbros Nigeria Consortium obtain some or all of the
EGGS business.

23. To implement this scheme, the former President of Willbros International caused
Willbros West Africa to enter into sham âconsultancy agreementsâ with an outside consultant in
Nigeria (âConsultant #1), whose company invoiced Willbros West Africa for purported
âconsultingâ services. The âconsultancy agreementsâ called for the payment, in exchange for
purportedly legitimate consulting services, of 3% of the contract revenue for certain projects,
including the EGGS project. The imvoices were submitted by Jansen and others to the

SEC v. Willbros Group, Inc., et al.
COMPLAINT
Page-7
Case 4:08-cv-01494 Document 1 Filed 05/14/2008 Page 8 of 25

companyâs administrative office in Houston for payment by wire transfer to a foreign bank, as
directed by the invoices.

24. | The wired money was purportedly for the legitimate consulting services provided
to Willbros affiliates, but, in fact, some or all of that money was intended for corrupt payments.
Steph and Willbros Group, through the conduct of the Former President of Willbros Â©
International, Steph and others, knew that Consultant #1, and others working with him, were
engaged, on behalf of the consortium, in corrupt negotiations with Nigerian officials who had
influence over the EGGS business. They further knew that that Consultant #1, and others
working with him, were using and intended to use some or all of the funds paid, out of a
Willbros Group bank account in Houston, to Consultant #1 to make corrupt payments to
Nigerian officials to cause those officials to award the EGGS project and its optional scopes of
work to the Willbros Nigeria Consortium.

25. | The money disbursed to the Consultant #1 was improperly recorded in Willbros ,
Groupâs books and records as legitimate consulting expenses or other business expenses.
Through this scheme, a portion of these so-called âcommitmentsâ had been paid by late 2004.
Additional âcommitmentsâ of millions of dollars remained to be paid later. These payments
would be funded as the consortium received future EGGS contract revenue, with 3% of that
revenue going to Consultant #1 or those working with him and with subsequent transfer of some
or all of that money to the Nigerian officials.

26. In January 2005, Willbros Group announced that the Former President of
Willbros International had resigned and that the companyâs audit committee had commenced an

internal investigation into allegations of tax improprieties concerning Willbros Transandina, a

SEC v. Willbros Group, Inc., et al.
COMPLAINT
Page-8
Case 4:08-cv-01494 Document 1 Filed 05/14/2008 Page 9 of 25

subsidiary operating in Bolivia under the management of the Former President of Willbros
International. The internal investigation expanded in scope to include activities in Nigeria.

27. As a result of the companyâs internal investigation, the âconsultingâ agreements
with Consultant #1âs companies were terminated and further payments to Consultant #1 ceased.
During this time, Steph and other Willbros personnel in Nigeria, including former Willbros
employee J.B. Brown (âBrownâ), learned of demands from Nigerian officials for continued
payment of the âcommitmentsâ related to the EGGS project. As a result, they became concerned
that failure to pay the âcommitmentsâ would result in, among other consequences, interference
with Willbros Internationalâs business operations and the potential loss of the EGGS Phase 2
contract (which had not yet been awarded).

28. In or around February 2005, Brown and Steph, in concert with employees of their
joint venture partner, met with a Nigerian consultant (âConsultant #2â) and determined to resume
the payments. At that meeting, Brown and Steph agreed to pay $1,850,000 toward the
outstanding âcommitments.â Because they could no longer generate money by submitting
invoices from Consultant #1âs companies, Steph and others engaged in the scheme sought
alternative sources. They agreed on several potential funding sources: (1) a loan from principals
of a Nigerian oil and gas company (âCompany 1â) to one of Willbrosâs Nigerian subsidiaries; (2)
a loan from the companyâs Willbros Nigeria Consortium partner to one of Willbrosâs Nigerian
subsidiaries; and (3) petty cash from a local account maintained by one of Willbrosâs Nigerian
subsidiaries.

29. Shortly thereafter, Brown, on behalf of Willbros West Africa, agreed to borrow,
pursuant to a written loan agreement, $1 million from the companyâs partner in the Willbros
Nigeria Consortium. He then âloanedâ the money to Consultant #2, for delivery to Nigerian

COMPLAINT

Case 4:08-cv-01494 Document 1 Filed 05/14/2008 Page 10 of 25

officials. Steph participated in the plan to fund the âcommitmentsâ and knew of Brownâs
actions.

30. To further help procure the $1,850,000, Steph borrowed, in Nigerian currency, the
equivalent of roughly $500,000 from another individual, working through a Nigerian oil and gas
company. He then delivered that money to Consultant #2 to be transferred to Nigerian officials.

31. âIn February or March 2005, Steph directed that the equivalent of approximately
$350,000 be procured from a Willbros cash account in Nigeria; Steph requested this money to
transfer it to Consultant #2 for delivery to Nigerian officials. This money was accumulated using
fictitious invoices to falsely inflate weekly funding requests transmitted to Willbros Groupâs
Houston administrative headquarters. Once he obtained the $350,000, Steph transferred it to
Consultant #2 for delivery to the Nigerian officials.

32. In or around August 2004, Willbros West Africa executed contracts for an
offshore Nigerian project that involved offshore pipeline work in Nigeria and which the

company expected to generate substantial revenue.

SEC v. Willbros Group, Inc., et al.
COMPLAINT
Page-10
Case 4:08-cv-01494 Document1 Filed 05/14/2008 Page 11 of 25

33. As with the scheme associated with the EGGS project described above, Willbros
Group, again through the conduct of the Former President of Willbros International and others,
agreed to make improper payments in excess of $5 million to, among others, officials of NNPC,
NAPIMS, a senior official in the executive branch of the Nigerian federal government, and a
Nigerian political party to assist in obtaining the offshore Nigeria contract business. At least
some of these payments had been made by the end of October 2004.

34. Further, from at least the early 1990âs through 2005, employees of Willbros
Group or its affiliates in Nigeria abused petty cash accounts to, among other things, make
repeated bribes to Nigerian tax and court officials.

35. For example, Willbros Groupâs affiliates, in order to maintain operations in
Nigeria, must pay taxes administered by various Nigerian states, including a Pay-As-You-Earn
(âPAYEâ) tax, based on employee earnings, which Willbros deducts from its workersâ salaries.
In order to reduce this tax obligation, employees of Willbros affiliates bribed auditors
responsible for determining the amount of tax owed.

36. During this same time period, Willbros International employees in Nigeria paid
clerks and other officials within the Nigerian judicial system in exchange for favorable treatment
in pending cases. These payments to court and tax officials were disguised within the companyâs
petty cash processes in Nigeria. Certain employees of Willbros Groupâs subsidiaries
requisitioned excess petty cash funds by submitting fictitious invoices from non-existent
vendors. For example, Jansen and Biggers inflated the cash needed by obtaining fictitious
invoices, typically for fuel, freight or catering expenses, from non-existent vendors. Jansen used
these fictitious invoices to inflate the anticipated expenditures that he projected in weekly
forecasts that he prepared or that were created under his direction. These artificially inflated

SEC v. Willbros Group, Inc., et al.
COMPLAINT
Page-11
Case 4:08-cv-01494 Document 1 Filed 05/14/2008 Page 12 of 25

reports were used to obtain cash (ultimately over $6 million) from the companyâs offices in
Houston. At least $300,000 of this money was used to make payments to Nigerian tax and court
officials. The Former President of Willbros International knew of these schemes and approved
them, either explicitly or implicitly.

37. As part of this scheme, Jansen routinely approved for payment invoices he knew
were false. He also knowingly submitted false cash requests and forecasts, knowing that those
false reports would generate fund that would at least in part by used to bribe Nigerian court and
tax officials. Biggers knowingly procured invoices he knew to be false and that he knew would
be used to procure funds that would be used to bribe Nigerian court and tax officials. Finally,
Steph knew about this conduct and approved it, both tacitly and on some occasions explicitly.

Bribery Scheme in Ecuador

38. In late 2003, the Former President of Willbros International instructed an
Ecuador-based, individual (âthe Ecuador employeeâ) to pursue business prospects in Ecuador on
behalf of Willbros Group and Willbros Ecuador. During this time period, Brown was helping
supervise the companyâs business in Ecuador. The Ecuador employeeâ telephoned Brown and
informed him that the company could obtain a $3 million contract to modify a pipeline running
from Santo Domingo to El Beaterio, Ecuador (âthe Santa Domingo Projectâ), if the company
would agree to pay $300,000 (10% of the contract value) to certain officials of PetroEcuador, an
oil-and-gas company wholly-owned by the government of Ecuador, and its subsidiary,
PetroComercial (collectively, âPetroEcuadorâ). The scheme called for $150,000 to be paid up
front, with the remaining $150,000 to be paid upon completion of the project. With approval

from the Former President of Willbros International, Brown and the Ecuador employee agreed to

SEC v. Willbros Group, Inc., et al.
COMPLAINT
Page-12
Case 4:08-cv-01494 Document1 Filed 05/14/2008 Page 13 of 25

make, on behalf of Willbros Group and its affiliates, the payments. In March 2004 the company
announced that it had received a letter of intent for the Santo Domingo Project.

39. | Between the January and June 2004 time period, the Former President of Willbros
International, on the companyâs behalf, communicated by e-mail and telephone with Brown to
arrange the transfer of $150,000 to employees of Willbros Ecuador so that they could deliver the
money to PetroEcuador officials. One or more of these e-mail communications were sent from |
Brown in South America through Willbros Groupâs server located in Houston, Texas.

40. In June 2004, the Former President of Willbros International directed an outside
consultant to wire $150,000 to the bank account of a second Willbros Ecuador employee, so that
the money could be then be used to make the payments to the PetroEcuador officials. The
Ecaudor employee confirmed to Brown that he had received and would deliver it to the
PetroEcuador officials.

41. While the Santo Domingo Project was underway, the PetroEcuador officials
involved in the scheme were replaced. The former officials, however, insisted on receiving the
second installment, while the newly installed officials also insisted on receiving payments. To
resolve this problem, acting on the approval of the Former President of Willbros International,
Brown attended a meeting at which the Ecuador employee met with both former and current
officials. Brown attended this meeting to ensure that the PetroEcuador officials understood that
the Ecuador employee had the full backing of the company. Ultimately, acting on authorization
from Brown and the Former President of Willbros International, the Ecuador employee brokered
a deal to pay the former officials an additional $90,000 and the new officials $165,000. In return
for this agreement, Willbros would retain the Santo Domingo project and would be awarded a
second project. The money for these payments was transferred to the private bank accounts of

SEC v. Willbros Group, Inc., et al.
COMPLAINT
Page-13
Case 4:08-cv-01494 Document1 Filed 05/14/2008 Page 14 of 25

Willbros Ecuador employees and their family members. These disbursements were falsely
recorded in the companyâs books and records as âconsultingâ expenses, âplatform expenses,â or
as âprepaid expenses.â

42. The company ultimately performed the Santa Domingo project, which generated
revenues of roughly 3.4 million dollars. When the bribes pertaining to the second project were
discovered in 2005, the company relinquished the project.

Fraudulent Tax Scheme in Bolivia

43. Willbros conducted business in Bolivia through Willbros Transandina, S.A., a
subsidiary of Willbros International. In late 2001, Willbros Transandina, as part of a joint
venture, was awarded a contract to complete a pipeline in Bolivia. By at least 2002, the Former
President of Willbros International began supervising this project.

44. In Bolivia, Willbros Transandina was required to pay 13% of its receipts to taxing
authorities in satisfaction of what is commonly referred to as a âvalue added taxâ (âVATâ).
Bolivian based companies then add the 13% VAT when they bill their Bolivian customers. If the
VAT a company collects from its customers is greater than the VAT it pays to its vendors, the
company must remit the difference to the taxing authority. In contrast, if a company pays more
than it collects, it does not owe a payment. In short, if a companyâs purchases (and therefore the
VAT paid to its vendors) exceeds the VAT it collects from its own customers, a company can, in
essence, âoffsetâ its VAT payment obligations.

45.  Willbros Group, through the actions of others, including the Former President of
Willbros International and a United States citizen serving as an outside consultant (the âoutside
consultantâ), devised and implemented a scheme to minimize Willbros Transandinaâs VAT
obligation by using fabricated invoices to Bolivian vendors as âoffsets.â This was accomplished

SEC v. Willbros Group, Inc., et al.
COMPLAINT
Page-14
Case 4:08-cv-01494 Document 1 Filed 05/14/2008 Page 15 of 25

by acquiring invoices that reflected fictitious transactions; these invoices were then used to
support tax returns that fraudulently claimed unearned VAT tax offsets.

46. In many cases, the outside consultant procured the fictitious invoices. Galvez, as
the in-country accountant and administrator for Willbros Transandina, acting under the direction
of the Former President of Willbros International, used the fictitious invoices to further the
scheme by, among other things, preparing false returns and related records.

47. As part of this scheme, the outside consultant submitted invoices for payment by
Willbros Group for purported consulting services. Willbros Group, acting through the Former
President of Willbros International, paid these invoices by wire transfer from Houston to foreign
accounts designated on the invoices. Rather than funding consulting services, however, these
funds were spent, at least in part, to procure the fictitious invoices and to otherwise support the
fraudulent tax minimization strategy. In 2004 alone, Willbros Group paid more than $500,000 to
the outside consultant.

48. As a result of this scheme, the contract costs and the VAT liabilities to the
Bolivian government for fiscal years 2002, 2003 and 2004 were materially understated; the
scheme effectively inflated Willbros Groupâs net income by approximately 6.4% in fiscal year
2003 and inflated earnings per share by approximately $.03 for both fiscal year 2003 and the first
three quarters of 2004.

49. In addition to VAT, the Bolivian government levies an income tax on foreign
companies doing business in Bolivia through a 12.5% withholding tax (âForeign Withholding
Taxâ). Willbros Group, primarily through conduct by the Former President of Willbros
International, materially understated its Foreign Withholding Tax liabilities during fiscal years
2002, 2003, and 2004. Specifically, in 2002, the Former President of Willbros International

SEC v. Willbros Group, Inc., et al.
COMPLAINT
Page-15
Case 4:08-cv-01494 Document 1 Filed 05/14/2008 Page 16 of 25

directed accounting personnel to reduce the Foreign Withholding Tax liabilities in Willbros
Groupâs books and records for purported tax savings. In 2003 and 2004, again at the direction of
the Former President of Willbros International, accounting personnel eliminated the Foreign
Withholding Tax liabilities from Willbros Groupâs books and records, by reducing the tax
liability account to offset cash disbursements made to the outside consultant and others. In
reality, there was no legitimate tax saving strategy. Instead the funds were merely used to
benefit the purported outside consultant and others. These actions and the resulting false records
caused the tax liability to be understated. As a result, for fiscal year 2003, these understatements
caused Willbros Groupâs net income to be inflated by approximately 6.4%.

50. During 2003 and 2004, Willbros Group offered and sold securities pursuant to
registration statements on Form S-8 and filed resale shelf registration statements on Form S-3.
These registration statements incorporated by reference the companyâs periodic filings that
contained the material misrepresentations discussed in the paragraphs above.

CLAIMS

FIRST CLAIM
violations of Exchange Act Section 30A

51. Paragraphs 1 through 50 are realleged and incorporated by reference.

53. As described above, Willbros Group and Defendant Steph, acting on behalf of
Willbros Group and its subsidiaries, made use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of

INSTRUCTIONS FOR ATTORNEYS COMPLETING CIVIL COVER SHEET FORM JS-44
Authority For Civil Cover Sheet

The JS-44 civil cover sheet and the information contained herein neither replaces nor supplements the filings and service of pleading or other papers as required
by law, except as provided by local rules of court. This form, approved by the Judicial Conference of the United States in September 1974, is required for the use of the
Clerk of Court for the purpose of initiating the civil docket sheet. Consequently a civil cover sheet is submitted to the Clerk of Court for each civil complaint filed. The
attorney filing a case should complete the form as follows:

I. (a)Plaintiffs - Defendants. Enter names (last, first, middle initial) of plaintiff and defendant. If the plaintiff or defendant is a government agency, use only the full
name or standard abbreviations. If the plaintiff or defendant is an official within a government agency, identify first the agency and then the official, giving both name
and title.

(b) County of Residence. For each case filed, except U.S. plaintiff cases, enter the name of the county where the first listed plaintiff resides at the time of filing. In U.S.
plaintiff cases, enter the name of the county in which the first listed defendant resides at the time of filing. (NOTE: In land condemnation cases, the county of residence
of the âdefendantâ is the location of the tract of land involved.)

(c) Attomeys. Enter the firm name, address, telephone number, and attorney of record. If there are several attorneys, list them on an attachment, noting in this section
â(see attachment)â.

II. Jurisdiction. The basis of jurisdiction is set forth under Rule 8(a), F.R.C.P., which requires that jurisdictions be shown in pleadings. Place an âXâ in one of the
boxes. If there is more than one basis of jurisdiction, precedence is given in the order shown below.

United States plaintiff. (1) Jurisdiction based on 28 U.S.C. 1345 and 1348. Suites by agencies and officers of the United States are included here,

United States defendant. (2) When the plaintiff is suing the United States, its officers or agencies, place an âXâ in this box.

Federal question. (3) This refers to suits under 28 U.S.C. 1331, where jurisdiction arises under the Constitution of the United States, an amendment to the Constitution,
an act of Congress or a treaty of the United States. In cases where the U.S. is a party, the U.S. plaintiff or defendant code takes precedence, and box 1 or 2 should be

marked.

Diversity of citizenship. (4) This refers to suits under 28 U.S.C. 1332, where parties are citizens of different states. When Box 4 is checked, the citizenship of the
different parties must be checked. (See Section III below; federal question actions take precedence over diversity cases.)

Ill. Residence (citizenship) of Principal Parties. This section of the JS-44 is to be completed if diversity of citizenship was indicated above. Mark this section for
each principal party.

IV. Nature of Suit. Place an âXâ in the appropriate box. If the nature of suit cannot be determined, be sure the cause of action, in Section IV above, is sufficient to
enable the deputy clerk or the statistical clerks in the Administrative Office to determine the nature of suit. If the cause fits more than one nature of suit, select the most
definitive

VY. Origin. Place an âXâ in one of the seven-boxes.

Original Proceedings. (1) Cases which originate in the United States district courts.

Removed from State Court. (2) Proceedings initiated in state courts may be removed to the district courts under Title 28 U.S.C., Section 1441. When the petition for
removal is granted, check this box.

Remanded from Appellate Court. (3) Check this box for cases remanded to the district court for further action. Use the date of remand as the filing date.
Reinstated or Reopened, (4) Check this box for cases reinstated or reopened in the district court. Use the reopening date as the filing date.

Transferred from Another District. (5) For cases transferred under Title 28 U.S.C. Section 1404(a). Do not use this for within district transfers or multidistrict litigation
transfers.

Multidistrict Litigation. (6) Check this box when a multidistrict case is transferred into the district under authority of Title 28 U.S.C. Section 1407. When this box is
checked, do not check (5) above.

Appeal to District Judge from Magistrate Judgment. (7) Check this box for an appeal from a magistrate judgeâs decision.

VI. Cause of Action. Report the civil statute directly related to the cause of action and give a brief description of the cause.

VII. Requested in Complaint. Class Action. Place an âXâ in this box if you are filing a class action under Rule 23, F.R.Cv.P.

Demand. In this space enter the dollar amount (in thousands of dollars) being demanded or indicate other demand such as a preliminary injunction.
Jury Demand. Check the appropriate box to indicate whether or not a jury is being demanded.

VIII. Related Cases. This section of the JS-44 is used to reference related pending cases if any. If there are related pending cases, insert the docket numbers and the
corresponding judge names for such cases.

Date and Attorney Signature. Date and sign the civil cover sheet.
