U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
Litigation Release No. 21335 / December 14, 2009

SEC v. Bobby Benton, Civil Action No. 4:09-CV-03963 (S.D. Texas,
December 11, 2009).

SEC CHARGES FORMER OFFICER OF PRIDE INTERNATIONAL WITH
VIOLATING THE FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT

On December 11, 2009, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged a
former officer of Pride International, Inc. (Pride) with violations relating to
bribes paid to foreign officials in Mexico and Venezuela. The Commission's
complaint names Bobby Benton of Houston, Texas, Pride's former Vice
President, Western Hemisphere Operations.

The complaint alleges that in December 2004, Benton authorized the bribery
of a Mexican customs official in return for favorable treatment regarding
customs deficiencies identified during an inspection of a supply boat. The
complaint further alleges that Benton had knowledge of a second bribe paid
to a different Mexican customs official that same month. It is also alleged that
from approximately 2003 to 2005, a manager of a Pride subsidiary in
Venezuela authorized the bribery of an official of Venezuela's state-owned oil
company in order to secure extensions of three drilling contracts. Benton, in
an effort to conceal these payments, redacted references to bribery in an
action plan responding to an internal audit report and signed two false
certifications in connection with audits and reviews of Pride's financial
statements denying any knowledge of bribery.

The SEC's complaint charges Benton with violating Sections 13(b)(5) and 30A
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 13b2-1 and 13b2-2
thereunder, and aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)
(2)(B), and 30A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The SEC's action
seeks a permanent injunction, a civil penalty, and the disgorgement of ill-
gotten gains plus prejudgment interest.

The Commission acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of the
Department of Justice and the FBI.

The SEC's investigation continues.
