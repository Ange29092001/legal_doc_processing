DESIST ORDER

 

 

I.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (âCommissionâ) deems it appropriate and in
the public interest that public administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby
are, instituted pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933 (âSecurities Actâ) and
Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ) against Alere Inc.
(âRespondentâ).

21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist
Order (âOrderâ), as set forth below.
Il.

On the basis of this Order and Respondentâs Offer, the Commission findsâ that:

Summary

1. Alere is a Massachusetts-based public company, traded on the New York Stock
Exchange, which manufactures and sells diagnostic tests for infectious disease, cardiometabolic
disease and toxicology. Alere maintains operations and sells its products around the world.
Between 2011 and 2016, Alere engaged in the improper premature recognition of revenue in its
financial statements filed with the Commission. And, between 2011 and 2013, Alereâs
subsidiary in Colombia improperly characterized payments to a Colombian government official
in Alereâs books and records. Alereâs subsidiary in India also failed to properly record certain
payments made by a distributor in its books and records. Alere further failed to devise and
maintain a sufficient system of internal accounting controls. As a result, Alere violated Sections
10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1,
13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act.

2. Since May 2015, Alere has at three different times revised or restated its financial
statements that had appeared in the companyâs periodic filings with the Commission. In May
2015, Alere restated its 2014 Form 10-K due to incorrect tax accounting. In August 2016, Alere
filed its 2015 Form 10-K, which revised the revenue and associated entries in its financial
statements for prior periods due to incorrect reporting of revenue. In June 2017, Alere filed its
2016 Form 10-K, which restated its revenue and associated entries for prior periods due to newly
discovered improper reporting of revenue. In total, Alere has restated its financial statements for
fiscal years 2013, 2014, and 2015 and for the following fiscal quarters: Q3 2014, Q1-Q3 2015,
and Q1-Q3 2016.

3. Revenue Recognition Problems: From 2011 to 2016, Alere misstated its
revenue in its financial statements filed with the Commission. These revenue misstatements
resulted from (a) intentional early reporting of revenue by Alereâs South Korean subsidiary,
Standard Diagnostics, and (b) improper revenue recognition practices by Alere at subsidiaries
located, among other locations, in South Korea, Israel, South Africa, Ireland, and China. The
improper revenue recognition practices primarily related to the timing of when Alere could have
recognized the revenue. As aresult, Alereâs revision and restatement of its revenue over the
five-year period, shifted to a later reporting period in total over $260 million in revenue from the
quarter in which it was originally recognized. The revenue involved in âearly salesâ and other
practices described below was eventually recognizable and collected, just not in the quarter in
which it was recorded.

4. Recording of Offers and Payments to Foreign Officials: Between 2011 and
2013, Alereâs foreign subsidiaries located in Colombia and India indirectly made improper offers

 

' The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondentâs Offer of Settlement and are not binding on any other

person or entity in this or any other proceeding.
and payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of making sales of its products.
Profits from the sales associated with the improper offers and payments totaled approximately
$3.3 million.

Respondent

5. Alere Inc. is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in
Waltham, MA. It is a manufacturer of medical diagnostic testing equipment. Alereâs common
stock is registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and trades on the New York
Stock Exchange under the symbol âALR.â

Other Relevant Entities

6. Alere Colombia S.A. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alere formerly known as
BioSystems, S.A. (âBioSystemsâ). Alere Colombia sells Alereâs global products into the
Colombian market. Alere Colombia is located in Bogota, Colombia. Biosystems was an
independent distributor of Alere products until acquired by Alere.

7. Standard Diagnostics, Inc. (âSDâ) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alere. Its
main products test for diseases such as Malaria, Dengue, HIV, and Syphilis. Standard
Diagnosticâs principal office is located in Giheung-gu, South Korea. Prior to 2010, Standard
Diagnostics was an independent and publicly-traded company listed in South Korea. Alere
acquired, through a tender offer, a majority share of its stock in 2010.

8. Alere Medical Private Ltd. (âAlere Indiaâ) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Alere. Alere India sells Alereâs global products into the Indian market. Alere Indiaâs principal
office is located in Gurgaon, India.

9. The VP of SD Sales, a resident and citizen of Korea, served as the head of SDâs
sales and marketing departments from 2011 until 2016. In 2013, he was also given the title of
Vice President of Commercial Operations Africa. During the entire time he was a management-
level employee working from an office in South Korea. Alere intended to terminate the VP of
SD Sales in 2015 based on conduct not related to the matters discussed herein, but postponed the

termination to cooperate with ongoing government investigations. The VP of SD Sales resigned
in 2016.

10. The SD Finance Director, a resident and citizen of Korea, served as the head of
SDâs finance department from 2011 until 2017. He was removed from his position following an
internal investigation in 2017 and subsequently resigned.

Facts

11. During the 2000s and early 2010s, Alere grew quickly, in part because it acquired
a number of foreign companies. Alereâs corporate finance group required all these newly
acquired companies to adopt Alereâs Revenue Recognition Policy.

12. Alereâs Revenue Recognition Policy established standards and procedures to
ensure that Alere recognized revenue in compliance with managementâs objectives and U.S.
3
generally accepted accounting principles (âGAAPâ). Among other things, the policy stated that
revenue should not be recognized until four basic criteria have been met: â(1) persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (3)
the fee is fixed and determinable; and (4) collection is reasonably assured.â More specifically,
the policy stated that Alere recognizes revenue upon title transfer of the products to third-party
customers.

13. Alereâs corporate finance group delegated revenue recognition decision-making
authority to Alereâs subsidiaries. These subsidiaries entered their revenue information into local
books and records, which were consolidated into Alereâs own books and records and used to
create the financial statements that it filed with the Commission.

Intentional False Reporting of Revenue at Alereâs South Korean-Subsidiary, SD

14. In February 2010, Alere acquired a majority interest in SD. Beginning with fiscal
year 2010, SDâs financials were consolidated into Alereâs financial statements, which were filed
in Alereâs Form 10-K.

15. Beginning no later than 2011, the VP of SD Sales initiated a scheme to inflate
SDâs revenue numbers at or near the end of reporting periods. The VP of SD Sales and other SD
employees wanted to accelerate revenue in order to meet African region sales quarterly and
annual revenue targets. The scheme involved recognizing revenue before delivery of the product
had occurred in violation of Alereâs Revenue Recognition Policy and in contravention of GAAP.
The practice came to be known amongst SD employees as âearly sales.â

16. âEarly salesâ were generally conducted in one of two ways:

a. In the first scenario, the product remained undelivered in SDâs warehouse
at the end of a quarter. SD employees then intentionally created false
delivery documents or falsified shipping documents to support a delivery
date before the end of a quarter. This falsified documentation was used to
recognize the sale of product days or weeks earlier than its actual delivery.

b. In the second scenario, immediately before the end of a quarter, SD would
direct a shipping agent to pick up product and store it in the shipping
agentâs warehouse until the customer requested delivery. SD employees
used the pick-up receipts from the shipping agent as proof of delivery to a
customer. This documentation was improperly used to recognize the sale
of product days or weeks earlier than its actual delivery.

17. The size of the transactions for which revenue was improperly recognized ranged
from as small as $25,000 to greater than $2 million.

18. To execute the scheme, the VP of SD Sales involved personnel from SDâs sales,
marketing, customer service, and warehouse departments.
19. Over time, the number of sales transactions improperly recognized early each
quarter grew, peaking in 2015. In the fourth quarter of 2015, SDâs fraudulent âearly salesâ
comprised approximately 29% of all the revenue SD reported that quarter. This inflated revenue
was incorporated in financial statements filed with Alereâs 2015 Form 10-K.

20. Initially, the scheme did not directly involve employees within SDâs finance
department. But by the end of 2015, at least two individuals in SDâs finance department, the SD
Finance Director and an SD Finance Manager, were aware of and complicit in âearly sales.â

21. During 2016, in response to issues with revenue recognition in China and Africa,
Alereâs management conducted an internal assessment of revenue recognition practices
throughout its subsidiaries. During the assessment, the SD Finance Director and the SD Finance
Manager intentionally concealed the âearly salesâ scheme from those conducting the assessment
and Alereâs independent auditors.

22. In fact, SD continued to prematurely recognize revenue during Alereâs ongoing
assessment by improperly recognizing revenue from unconsummated sales on the last day of Q2
and Q3 2016. SDâs improper revenue recognition continued through Q4 2016.

23. As a result of the conduct described above, Alere violated Section 10(b) of the
Securities Exchange Act, Rule 10b-5 thereunder, which prohibit fraudulent conduct in
connection with the purchase or sale of securities, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act which
prohibits fraudulent conduct in the offer and sale of securities. This conduct also contributed to
Alereâs violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules
12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder, which require every issuer of a security registered
pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act to file with the Commission information, documents,
and annual and quarterly reports as the Commission may require, and mandate that periodic
reports contain such further material information as may be necessary to make the required
statements not misleading.

Failure to Conform Revenue Reporting to GAAP by Alere from 2013-2016
Chinese âBill and Holdâ Transactions

24. From Q4 2012 through Q1 2016, employees at an Alere subsidiary located in
China recognized revenue from the sale of product that remained undelivered at the subsidiaryâs
warehouses. The practice was called âpostponement of delivery.â While customers agreed not to
take delivery and submitted a âDeclaration of Postponementâ form to the subsidiary, the
arrangement did not permit the recognition of revenue under applicable Bill & Hold guidance
under GAAP. From 2013 to 2016, the subsidiary entered into more than 3,800 âpostponement of
deliveryâ transactions associated with more than $28 million in revenue that was recognized in
an earlier quarter than permissible under GAAP.
African Contingent Arrangements, Bill-and-Hold Transactions, and Revenue Cut-off
Issues

25. From at least 2013 through 2015, employees of Alereâs Africa commercial team
entered into sales arrangements for which revenue was improperly recognized. Sales included
contingent arrangements,â bill and hold transactions,â and sales where product was stored at a
third-partyâs warehouse. In addition, revenue from certain sales of Alere product to be used in
Africa was improperly recognized due to cut-off issues and improper execution of or changes to
shipping terms.

26. Alereâs Africa commercial team included employees from Alereâs Israeli, South
African, and Irish subsidiaries and employees from SD. In general, commercial and finance
personnel lacked a sufficient understanding of how such arrangements and shipping terms
affected when Alere could recognize revenue under U.S. GAAP.

27. These sales arrangements and issues led to Alere recognizing revenue of
approximately $24 million in an earlier quarter than permissible under GAAP.

African Distributor Sales Agreements

28. From at least 2011 through 2015, employees of Alereâs Africa commercial team
made sales to distributors operating in Africa pursuant to distributor sales agreements. Many of
the agreements with African distributors executed by Alereâs Israeli and South African
subsidiaries contained a provision, a âRetention of Titleâ clause, that stated Alere retained title to
the product until it was paid in full by the distributor.â As written, the provision precluded Alere
from recognizing revenue under GAAP until Alere received payment for the product from the
distributor. Finance personnel, however, either failed to review the Retention of Title clause in
the agreements or were unaware of its implication for revenue recognition.

29. Typically, Alereâs African distributor customers had at least 30 days to pay for
products. Lacking the resources and understanding of GAAP, Alereâs subsidiaries, recognized
revenue upon delivery, often immediately before or at the end of a quarter, even though without
payment this was not proper given the presence of the Retention of Title clause.

30. As aresult, Alere recognized more than $86 million in revenue from sales to
African distributors in an earlier quarter than permissible under GAAP.

 

* Contingent arrangements do not become fixed or determinable until the contingency resolves, and thus, revenue
may not be recognized until that time.

* The distribution agreements generally included language stating that the distributor was holding the product for
Alere and the product needed to be stored separately and labeled as Alereâs product and that Alere maintained the
right to enter the distributorsâ premises and remove its product. As such, these distributor arrangements were broad
and therefore extended beyond the retention of title exemption contemplated in Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104.

6
Other Revenue Recognition Issues

31. In addition, from at least 2013 through 2015, Alere experienced wide-spread
month or quarter end revenue cut-off issues at subsidiaries located around the world, including in
Argentina, Australia, Brazil, China, Colombia, Japan, the United States, and Europe. The
various subsidiaries independently used similar improper quarter end cut-off procedures for
revenue.

32. As a result of the improper revenue recognition cut-off practices, Alere
recognized approximately $97 million in revenue from non-African customers in an earlier
quarter than permissible under GAAP.

33. The conduct at Alereâs subsidiaries described above contributed to Alereâs
violations of 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1,
13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder, and Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act.

Improper Revenue Recognition Led to Required Restatements of Commission Filings
and Revisions of Financial Statements and Assessments of the Effectiveness of Internal
Control over Financial Reporting

34. To correct the inaccurate revenue reporting summarized above, Alere revised and
restated its financial statements.

35. On February 26, 2016, Alere filed a Form 12b-25 with the Commission
announcing a delay in the filing of its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 due to
managementâs âanalysis of certain aspects of revenue recognition in Africa and China and any
potential implications on our evaluation of internal control over financial reporting for the year

ended December 31, 2015.â

36. Management completed its assessment of revenue recognition and filed with the
Commission Form 10-K for 2015 on August 8, 2016. Alere reported:

Based on our review, we determined that, in 2013 and 2014 and the first three quarters of
2015, we had incorrectly recorded certain revenue transactions for such periods.
Specifically, the errors in the application of U.S. GAAP rules regarding the timing of
revenue recognition primarily relate to: (4) transactions, principally in Africa, in which
we recognized revenue when the product shipped to the distributor, but we contractually
retained title in the products until the distributor paid for the products in full or the
distributor was not obligated to pay us until the products were sold through to the end-
user; (11) âbill and holdâ transactions, principally in China, which did not meet the criteria
for revenue recognition under U.S. GAAP; and (111) other transactions, in which we
recognized revenue prior to full satisfaction of all contractual criteria for title and risk of
loss passing to the customer.

37. Alere concluded that it had several material weaknesses in internal control over
financial reporting related to revenue recognition:
a. We did not maintain a sufficient complement of resources at our
subsidiaries with appropriate knowledge, experience and training to ensure proper
application of US GAAP in determining revenue recognition.

b. We also did not maintain effective controls over information and
communications as it relates to revenue recognition at our subsidiaries. Specifically, we
did not implement and reinforce an adequate process for internally communicating
nonstandard terms and conditions between our subsidiariesâ commercial operations and
finance groups and between our subsidiariesâ finance groups and our corporate
accounting group.

C. We did not design effective controls over the review of terms of purchase
orders and customer contracts, including amendments to contracts, to ensure proper
application of US GAAP in determining revenue recognition.

d. We did not design effective controls to ensure that revenue would not be
recognized until title and risk of loss had passed to our customers.

38. On March 1, 2017, Alere filed another Form 12b-25 with the Commission,
announcing a delay in filing its Form 10-K for 2016 because the Company was âreviewing
certain aspects of revenue recognition at its Korean ... location[].â Specifically, Alere disclosed
âimappropriate conduct at the Companyâs subsidiary in South Korea, Standard Diagnostics, Inc.â

39. On April 17, Alere filed Form 8-K with the Commission, to announce that its
Audit Committee had concluded that the Companyâs previously filed financial statements for the
years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, and the first three quarters of 2016, should not

be relied upon.

AO. On June 5, 2017, following an internal investigation into the South Korean
conduct, Alere filed its Form 10-K with the Commission for 2016. The investigation found that
previously filed financial statements included errors involving the timing of revenue recognition
caused by, â...among other things, misrepresentation and/or fabrication of documents used to
validate revenue recognition....â

Al. Alereâs restated financial statements in the 2016 Form 10-K also establish that
Alereâs press releases announcing its quarterly and annual financial results filed with the
Commission as exhibits to its Form 8-Ks were also misstated.

42. The table below illustrates the cumulative impact of the out-of-period accounting
errors on net revenue and net income (loss) recorded by Alere in its August 2016 revision and
the June 2017 restatement for the periods 2013, 2014 and the first three quarters of 2015 which
were subject to the August 2016 revision.â

44. Alere reported in its Form 10-K for 2016 that the four material weaknesses cited
in the 2015 10-K remained in place as of December 31, 2016 and Alere added a fifth material

weakness disclosure:

We did not maintain an effective control environment at [SD]. Specifically, certain

employees at SD engaged in inappropriate conduct, which was facilitated by an

inadequate segregation of duties, including (a) colluding with subordinates and certain

third parties to circumvent controls and fabricate documents related to revenue

recognition and other matters, some of which were provided to finance management and
our external auditors and (b) overriding controls related to the observation of physical
inventories. In addition, other employees, including certain members of SD finance
management responsible for other controls at the subsidiary, were aware of the override
of controls but did not report this conduct as required by our policies and procedures.

Alere Also Misstated Its Financial Statements Due to Tax Accounting Errors

45. By 2014, Alere stopped acquiring companies and instead began to divest itself of
various subsidiaries and business segments. In October 2014, Alere sold two subsidiaries,
Accountable Care Solutions, LLC and Wellogic ME FZâ LLC. In January 2015, Alere sold the

remaining portion of its health management business. These sales affected Alereâs accounting
for its income taxes including income tax expense or benefit and associated assets and liabilities.

46. On February 10, 2015, before it finished its tax accounting for Fiscal Year 2014,
Alere released its unaudited financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2014. It
announced a net loss of $165 million.

47.  Alereâs external tax consultants advised the head of Alereâs tax department that
Alere was incorrectly accounting for Alereâs divestiture of part of its health management
business. The head of the tax department disagreed and decided not to follow the advice of the
external tax consultants.

AS. Alere intended to file its Form 10-K on March 3, 2015, but its external auditor
questioned the tax accounting for the sale of the health management business. The external
auditor took the same position as Alereâs external tax consultant had. As a result, instead of
filing its Form 10-K with the Commission, Alere filed for a 15-day extension and began re-
calculating its tax provision and associated assets and liabilities.

49. Two days later, on March 5, 2015, Alere filed its 10-K. Correcting the tax error
contained in the previously disclosed financial results caused an increase in Alereâs reported net
income of over $175 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 which caused the previously
reported net loss to swing to profit of approximately $10 million.

50. While closing the financial statements for the first quarter of 2015 in April 2015,
Alere discovered that its previous calculations for the tax impact of the divestiture were
incorrect. After further analysis, Alere concluded that it had also incorrectly accounted for the
tax impact of the divestiture of the other subsidiaries it sold in October 2014. As a result of these
errors (and other out-of-period errors predominately related to tax matters), on May 28, 2015,
Alere filed an amended Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 which restated the
previously reported net income of approximately $10 million to a net loss of over $37 million.

51. | The conduct described above contributed to Alereâs violations of 13(a),
13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13
thereunder.

Tax Accounting Errors Led to Required Restatements of Financial Statements
and Assessments of Effectiveness of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

52. On March 5, 2015, Alere filed with the Commission its Form 10-K for the 2014
fiscal year. That Form 10-K disclosed a material weakness in Alereâs Internal Control over
Financial Reporting. The accounting error was corrected in the 2014 financial statements, and
the material weakness as of December 31, 2014 was disclosed as follows:

We did not design effective controls to assess the accounting for deferred tax assets
which become recognizable as a result of dispositions.

10
53. On May 28, 2015, Alere filed with the Commission its Form 10-K/A, amending
and restating the Form 10-K it filed in March 2015. Alere concurrently filed Form 10-Q/A for
the third quarter of 2014. The financial statements for the remaining 2014 quarters and prior
years presented in the filings were revised, but not restated. The accounting errors leading to the
May 2015 restatement principally related to the areas covered by the previously disclosed
material weakness, but also incorporated other out-of-period errors involving tax and non-tax
areas. The following table illustrates the impact to Alereâs previously reported annual net

54. In connection with the May 28, 2015 Form 10-K/A, Alere revised its previously
disclosed material weakness as of December 31, 2014:

We did not design effective controls to assess the accounting for deferred taxes related to
dispositions.

55. On November 9, 2015, Alere filed with the Commission its Form 10-Q for the
third quarter ended September 30, 2015. In this filing, Alere disclosed that it had discovered and
corrected certain out-of-period errors related to 2014 in Q3 2015 associated with accounting for
U.S. taxes on foreign earnings. In the Form 10-Q for Q3 2015, Alere expanded its disclosure of
the material weakness which existed at December 31, 2014 to:

We did not maintain a sufficient complement of resources with adequate experience and
expertise in accounting for income taxes, as a result of which our accounting controls did
not operate at a level of precision to identify errors in the calculation of tax balances
resulting from dispositions and U.S. taxes on foreign earnings.

56. On November 13, 2015, Alere filed another Form 10-K/A for 2014 to restate its
previously filed financial statements. The Form 10-K/A incorporated the expanded material
weakness disclosure described in the Form 10-Q filed five days before.

Alere Recorded Improper Payments
from BioSystems to a Government Official in Colombia

57. During 2007 and 2008, Alere purchased a private Colombian distributer of Alere
products called BioSystems, S.A., ultimately renaming it Alere Colombia in 2016. In
conjunction with the acquisition, Alere installed Biosystemsâ former primary shareholder and
owner as Biosystemsâ General Manager (the âColombia GMâ).

11
58. Biosystemsâ customers included a set of entities known as an Entidad Promotora
de Salud, or EPS, which provided health insurance services for their members. These entities
were created by Colombian law as part of the Colombian governmentâs efforts to provide
universal health benefits to its citizens. Under this system, EPSs were responsible for organizing
and guaranteeing the provision of health services for their enrolled participants and managing
their participantsâ health risks. Among other things, EPSs contracted for health services on
behalf of their participants through a network of public, private, and their own health service
providers. EPSs were both private and government controlled.

59. From at least 2006, Biosystems sold products to an EPS that operated as a private
entity (the âCustomer EPSâ). Biosystemsâ contact at the Customer EPS was a management level
employee (âthe âCustomer EPS Managerâ) responsible for, among other things, recommending
and approving products â including Biosystemsâ products â for the Customer EPS to purchase
and provide to its enrolled participants. The Colombia GM oversaw the Customer EPS account
and dealt directly with the Customer EPS Manager.

60. During 2011 through 2013, due to allegations of mismanagement at the Customer
EPS, the Government of Colombia, acting through the Ministry of Health, took control and
direction of the Customer EPS. During this time, the Customer EPS was an instrumentality of
the Government of Colombia and its employees were officials of the Government of Colombia.
In 2013, the Ministry of Health began dissolving the Customer EPS and transferring its members
to another EPS.

61. From 2007 through at least 2012, Biosystems, at the direction of the Colombia
GM, made improper payments totaling approximately $275,000 to the Customer EPS Manager
in order to obtain and retain business from the Customer EPS. The payments began at least six
months before Alere acquired Biosystems. Biosystems disguised these improper payments as
payments for purported consulting services from the Customer EPS Managerâs husband, sister-
in-law, and friend. In fact, none of the recipients of these improper payments performed
legitimate consulting services for Biosystems sufficient to justify the amount of payments
received.

62. From 2011 through 2013, Biosystems sold approximately $7.6 million of products
to the Customer EPS. During this time, the Customer EPS Manager continued in her position at
the Customer EPS and remained responsible for recommending Biosystemsâ products to the
Customer EPS. From 2011 through 2013, Biosystems earned approximately $3.18 million in
profits from the approximate $7.6 million in sales to the Customer EPS. In 2013, the Colombia
GM hired the Customer EPS Manager to work at Biosystems.

63.  In2015, Alereâs corporate management began an internal investigation into
consulting payments at Biosystems and discovered the improper payments. Shortly thereafter,
the Customer EPS Manager resigned from Biosystems. The Colombia GM had previously
resigned from Biosystems in January 2015.

64. The improper payments to the Customer EPS Manager were recorded as
legitimate consulting expenses in Biosystemsâ books and records. Biosystemsâ books and

12
records were consolidated into Alereâs books and records thereby causing Alereâs books and
records to be inaccurate. Alere also failed to devise and maintain an adequate system of
accounting controls sufficient to prevent and detect the improper payments that occurred over
several years.

65. Through the conduct described above, Alere violated Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and
13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act through the inaccurate recording of the payments to the
Customer EPSâs relations on its books and records, and its failure to devise or maintain internal
accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that its funds would not be used
to make improper payments in contravention of Alereâs policies.

Alere India Failed to Maintain Internal Controls
Against Improper Payments to Government Officials

66. In 2011, an India-based subsidiary of Alere, Alere Medical Pvt. Ltd. (âAlere
Indiaâ), acting through an India-based distributor (âIndia Distributorâ), won a contract to provide
malaria testing kits to a local governmental entity for a national disease control program.

67.  Inearly 2012, the India Distributor wrote a letter to Alere Indiaâs then-Vice
President of Marketing and Sales about the tender. The India Distributor noted that it had met
with officials of the local governmental entity who had informed them that if the local
governmental officials were paid a four percent commission, they would increase the orders
under the tender from 200,000 to 1,000,000 testing kits. Alere Indiaâs Vice President of
Marketing and Sales approved the four percent commission and the India Distributor proceeded
to incorporate the increased commission amount into the prices for the test kits. Alere India
failed to record the additional commission in its books and records.

68. In August 2012, the India Distributor requested from Alere India a credit memo
for the commission it had paid the local government officials in connection with the initial
200,000 test kits it had provided to the local governmental entity. Around the same time, the
India Distributor paid Alere India the amounts owed for the 200,000 test kits, but deducted the
commission paid to the local government officials from the total payment amount. The India
Distributor noted the reasons for the deduction on an invoice accompanying the payment.

69. In December 2012, the new management at Alere India discovered the unpaid
credit memo associated with the 200,000 test kits. Alereâs corporate management initiated an
internal investigation, and it directed Alere India to refuse to issue the requested credit memo.
Alere India requested and received re1mbursement from the India Distributor for increased
commission the India Distributor had withheld on that order. Alere, however, retained the
approximate $150,000 in profits that it obtained from the increased contract.

70. Through the conduct described above, Alere violated Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and
13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act through the inaccurate recording of the commissions paid by
Alere India on its books and records, and its failure to devise or maintain internal accounting
controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that its funds would not be used to make
improper payments in contravention of Alereâs policies.

Alere Offered Securities

71. During the relevant period, Alere issued shares through a number of employee
share purchase programs offered to employees. Also during the relevant period, Alere issued
debt securities, including, on June 24, 2015, Alere completed an offering of $425 million of
6.375% senior subordinated notes due in 2023. Alere also issued senior notes on December 11,
2012 and May 24, 2013.

Violations

72. Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder prohibit fraudulent
conduct in connection with the purchase and sale of a security. As a result of the conduct
described above related to early sales at SD, Alere violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act
and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

73. Section 17(a) of the Securities Act prohibits fraudulent conduct in the offer and
sale of securities. As a result of the conduct described above, Alere violated Section 17(a) of the
Securities Act.

TA. Section13(a) of the Exchange Act requires issuers of securities registered pursuant
to Section 12 of the Exchange Act to file periodic and other reports with the Commission. With
exceptions not applicable here, Rules 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 of the Exchange Act require
each issuer to file annual, current, and quarterly reports respectively on the appropriate forms
and within the period specific on the form. Rule 12b-20 further requires that the required reports
contain such further material information, if any, as may be necessary to make the required
statements, in light of the circumstances under which they are made not misleading. As a result
of the conduct described above, Alere violated Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-
20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder.

75. Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act requires issuers of securities registered
pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act to make and keep books, records and accounts,
which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect their transactions and dispositions of
their assets. As a result of the conduct described above, Alere violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) of
the Exchange Act.

76. Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act requires issuers of securities registered
pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act to, among other things, devise and maintain a system
of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles and that transactions are executed in accordance with
managementâs general or specific authorization. As a result of the conduct described above,
Alere violated Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act.

IV.

In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions
agreed to in Respondent Alereâs Offer.

14
Accordingly, pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act and Section 21C of the
Exchange Act, it is hereby ORDERED that:

A. Respondent Alere shall cease and desist from committing or causing any
violations and any future violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the
Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13thereunder, and Section 17(a)
of the Securities Act.

B. Respondent shall, within 14 days of the entry of this Order, pay a civil money
penalty of $9,200,000, disgorgement of $3,328,689, and prejudgment interest of $495,196 to the
Securities and Exchange Commission for transfer to the general fund of the United States
Treasury, subject to Exchange Act Section 21F(g)(3). If timely payment is not made, additional
interest shall accrue pursuant to SEC Rule of Practice 600 and 31 U.S.C. Â§3717.

Payment must be made in one of the following ways:

(1) Respondent may transmit payment electronically to the Commission,
which will provide detailed ACH transfer/Fedwire instructions upon
request;

(2) Respondent may make direct payment from a bank account via Pay.gov
through the SEC website at http://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ofm.htm; or

 

(3) Respondent may pay by certified check, bank cashierâs check, or United
States postal money order, made payable to the Securities and Exchange
Commission and hand-delivered or mailed to:

Enterprise Services Center
Accounts Receivable Branch

HQ Bldg., Room 181, AMZ-341
6500 South MacArthur Boulevard
Oklahoma City, OK 73169

Payments by check or money order must be accompanied by a cover letter identifying
Alere, Inc. as a Respondent in these proceedings, and the file number of these proceedings; a
copy of the cover letter and check or money order must be sent to Associate Director John
T.Dugan, Division of Enforcement, Securities and Exchange Commission, Boston Regional
Office, 33 Arch Street, 24" Floor, Boston, MA 02110.

C. Amounts ordered to be paid as civil money penalties pursuant to this Order shall
be treated as penalties paid to the government for all purposes, including all tax purposes. To
preserve the deterrent effect of the civil penalty, Respondent agrees that in any Related Investor
Action, it shall not argue that it is entitled to, nor shall it benefit by, offset or reduction of any
award of compensatory damages by the amount of any part of Respondentâs payment of a civil
penalty in this action (âPenalty Offsetâ). If the court in any Related Investor Action grants such

15
a Penalty Offset, Respondent agrees that it shall, within 30 days after entry of a final order
granting the Penalty Offset, notify the Commission's counsel in this action and pay the amount of
the Penalty Offset to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such a payment shall not be
deemed an additional civil penalty and shall not be deemed to change the amount of the civil
penalty imposed in this proceeding. For purposes of this paragraph, a âRelated Investor Actionâ
means a private damages action brought against Respondent by or on behalf of one or more
investors based on substantially the same facts as alleged in the Order instituted by the
Commission in this proceeding.

By the Commission.
