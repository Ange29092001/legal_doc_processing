UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE

 

COMMISSION,
Civil Action No.
Plaintiff,
Vv.
HITACHI, LTD.,
Defendant.
COMPLAINT

Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (âCommissionâ) alleges:
SUMMARY

1. This action arises from violations of the books and records and internal accounting
controls provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (âFCPAâ) [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78m(b)(2)(A)-(B)]
by defendant Hitachi, Ltd. (âHitachiâ).

2. In 2005, Hitachi created a subsidiary in South Afmica for the purpose of establishing
a local presence in that country to pursue lucrative public and private contracts, including
government contracts to build two new major power stations.

3. Hitachi sold 25% of the stock in the newly created subsidiary to Chancellor House
Holdings (Pty) Ltd. (âChancellorâ), a local South African company that was a front for the African
National Congress (âANCâ), South Africaâs ruling political party. Hitachiâs arrangement gave

Chancellor â and by proxy the ANC â the ability to share in the profits from any power station
Case 1:15-cv-01573 Document1 Filed 09/28/15 Page 2 of 21

contracts secured by Hitachi. Hitachi also entered into an undisclosed âsuccess feeâ arrangement
with Chancellor, wherein Chancellor would be entitled to âsuccess feesâ in the event that the
contract awards were âsubstantially as a resultâ of Chancellorâs efforts.

4, During the bidding process, Hitachi was aware that Chancellor was a funding
vehicle for the ANC. Hitachi nevertheless continued to partner with Chancellor and encourage
Chancellorâs use of its political influence to help obtain the government contracts.

5. As a result, Hitachi was awarded power station contracts in South Africa worth
approximately $5.6 billion.â In April and July 2008, Hitachi paid the ANC â through Chancellor â
âsuccess feesâ totaling approximately $1 million.

6. Hitachiâs South African subsidiary inaccurately recorded its âsuccess feeâ payments
to Chancellor as âconsulting feesâ in its books and records for the year ended December 31, 2008.
The inaccurate books and records of Hitachiâs subsidiary were consolidated into Hitachiâs financial
statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, which were filed with the Commission.

7. In 2010, Hitachiâs South African subsidiary also inaccurately recorded a dividend
worth over a million dollars to be paid to Chancellor, its 25% shareholder. The journal entry
recorded this dividend as âDividends Declaredâ in the subsidiaryâs books and records for the year
ended December 31, 2010. The books and records did not reflect that the dividend was, in fact, an
amount due for payment to a foreign political party in exchange for its political influence in

assisting Hitachi land two government contracts. The subsidiaryâs inaccurate books and records

 

| Where contract amounts, success fees, dividend declarations, and other figures were in
South African rand, those figures have been converted to U.S. dollars at the exchange rate
prevailing at the relevant time.
Case 1:15-cv-01573 Document1 Filed 09/28/15 Page 3 of 21

were consolidated into Hitachiâs financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011,
which were filed with the Commission.

8. Hitachi has violated, and unless enjoined will again violate, Section 13(b)(2)(A) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ) [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78m(b)(2)(A)] by failing to
make and keep books, records, and accounts, which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflected the transactions and dispositions of the assets of Hitachi. Hitachi also has violated, and
unless enjoined will again violate, Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C.

Â§ 78m(b)(2)(B)] by failing to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls
sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that transactions were recorded in accordance with
managementâs general or specific authorization; that transactions were recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles or any other criteria applicable to such statements, and to maintain accountability for
assets; that access to assets was permitted only in accordance with managementâs general or
specific authorization; and that the recorded accountability for assets was compared with the
existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action was taken with respect to any
differences.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

9. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 21(d), 21(e), and 27
of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78u(d), 78u(e), & 78aa].

10. Venue in the District of Columbia is proper pursuant to Section 27 of the Exchange
Act [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78aa] because acts or transactions constituting federal securities law violations

occurred in this district and, at the time of the violations, Hitachi transacted business in this district.

DEFENDANT

11. Hitachi, Ltd. is a multinational conglomerate that, among other things, designs and
constructs power stations. The company is headquartered in Tokyo, Japan and, including its
subsidiaries, has more than 320,000 employees worldwide.

12. At the trme of the violations, and from at least January 1, 2005 until April 26, 2012,
Hitachiâs American Depositary Shares (âADSsâ) â representing shares of common stock â were
registered with the Commission under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§ 781] and
were listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Hitachi was an issuer of securities in the
United States and filed reports on Form 20-F with the Commission pursuant to Section 13(a) of the
Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78m]. On April 16, 2012, Hitachi filed a Form 25 with the
Commission voluntarily withdrawing its ADSs from listing and registration. The delisting was
effective ten days later, on April 26, 2012, and Hitachiâs duty to file reports under Section 13(a) of
the Exchange Act was automatically suspended at the same time as the delisting. On April 27,
2012, Hitachi filed a Form 15F with the Commission voluntarily terminating its registration under
Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act and terminating its duty to file reports pursuant to Section 15(d)
of the Exchange Act. Termination of Hitachiâs registration and duty to file reports with the
Commission became effective on July 26, 2012. Hitachiâs ADSs continue to be traded on the U.S.
over-the-counter market. If Hitachi were to file a new registration statement registering an offering
of its securities pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 77a, et seq.], or a new

Exchange Act registration statement registering a class of its securities under Section 12 of the
Case 1:15-cv-01573 Document1 Filed 09/28/15 Page 5 of 21

Exchange Act, it would once again become subject to reporting obligations under Section 13(a) or
15(d) of the Exchange Act.
OTHER RELEVANT ENTITIES

13. Hitachi Power Europe GmbH (âHPEâ) was an international supplier of boilers for
power stations. Before 2006, HPE was known as Babcock Hitachi Europe GmbH.â At all relevant
times, HPE was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hitachi based in Germany. In 2014, HPEâs projects
and personnel were transferred to a joint venture formed between Hitachi and another Japanese
conglomerate.

14, Hitachi Power Africa (Pty) Ltd. (âHPAâ) executed power station orders in South
Africa. HPA was established in 2005 and, at all relevant times, was a majority-owned subsidiary
of HPE based in South Africa. In 2014, HPAâs projects and personnel were transferred to the joint
venture above.

15. The African National Congress has been the ruling political party of the
Government of South Africa since 1994.

16. Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd. (âEskomâ) is a government-owned and government-run

of all electricity in South Africa and the Government of South Africa is Eskomâs sole shareholder.
Thus, Eskom is an instrumentality of a foreign government. From 2006 to at least 2008, Eskomâs
chairman simultaneously served as a member of the ANCâs National Executive Committee.

Johannesburg that in the 1950s housed the law firm of Nelson Mandela and Oliver Tambo, two
future ANC presidents. From 2005 to at least 2008, Chancellorâs parent organization, Chancellor
House Trust, was administered by a member of the ANC National Executive Committee and a
director of Eskom Enterprises, an Eskom subsidiary.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

 

Background of Hitachiâs Effort to Enter the South African Power Market

18. In 2003, Hitachi began looking to enter the South African power market. At the
time, Eskom, the largest government-owned and government-run public utility in South Africa,
was planning to build new power stations in South Africa. Through its subsidiary in Europe,
Hitachi hired an expert in the South African power industry as a consultant to explore the potential
business opportunity. HPEâs consultant met with public and private power producers, including
Eskom, and learned of Eskomâs plans to build two new power stations, the Medupi power station
and the Kusile power station.

19. HPEâs consultant â who was later appointed as an executive at HPA â never
received training from Hitachi regarding compliance with the FCPA. In fact, neither HPE nor
HPA conducted any FCPA-specific compliance training for any HPE or HPA officers or
employees between January 2005 and December 2008.

20. In April 2005, HPE held meetings in South Africa with senior Hitachi executives to
discuss the business opportunities in that country. Hitachi decided to form a subsidiary in South
Africa â the entity that would become known as HPA â for the purpose of establishing a local
presence to help Hitachi pursue contracts with public and private entities in South Africa, including

the Eskom power station contracts.
Case 1:15-cv-01573 Document1 Filed 09/28/15 Page 7 of 21

21. The attendees of the April 2005 meetings also agreed that, in establishing a local
presence in South Africa, Hitachi would seek to identify a local black-owned entity or entities with
whom HPA could partner in connection with its submission of bids, or âtenders,â for government
business. By partnering with a local black-owned entity, HPA would seek to qualify under the
requirements of South Africaâs Black Economic Empowerment Act of 2003 (âBEEâ), which
promoted participation in the South African economy by companies that were at least 25% owned
by black South Africans or black-owned South African entities. In general, companies that
qualified under the terms of the BEE enjoyed preferential status in government procurements.

Before Submitting Tenders to Win the Eskom Contracts, Hitachi Enters into a Relationship
with Chancellor

Hitachi Identifies Chancellor for a 25% Equity Stake in HPA

 

22. In seeking local BEE partners, HPE prioritized a prospective partnerâs ability to
exert political influence over engineering or operational capacity. Consistent with this criterion,
Hitachi identified Chancellor as a potential partner. Hitachi understood, and it was commonly
known, that both Chancellor and its parent organization, Chancellor House Trust, had extensive
political connections within the Government of South Africa, with the ANC, and with Eskom. For
example, Hitachi knew or could have learned:
Â° An administrator of Chancellor House Trust was a member of the
ANC National Executive Committee from 2002 to 2007;

. The chairman of Eskomâs board of directors, who also was a
member of the ANC National Executive Committee, co-owned a
separate investment company with the chairman of Chancellor

House Trust;
Case 1:15-cv-01573 Document1 Filed 09/28/15 Page 8 of 21

Â° An administrator of Chancellor House Trust also was a director of
Eskom Enterprises, an Eskom subsidiary; and

. Chancellorâs chairman was married to a family member of Eskomâs

chief executive officer.

23. While its political connections were extensive, Chancellor lacked any engineering
or operational capabilities that could assist Hitachi with contract performance should it secure the
Eskom contracts. Chancellor differed in this respect from at least one other local South African
entity that Hitachi initially considered for partnership with HPA.

24. Hitachi was fully aware of Chancellorâs operational shortcomings, and sought a
partnership with Chancellor precisely because Chancellor would not provide it operational support.
From an internal profile of Chancellor prepared in 2005, HPEâs senior management was advised
that Chancellor âhas a lean HQ staff and it does not get involved in the operational business of the
companies in which it invests. Support for invested companies is provided via networking at board
level.â The internal profile also specifically highlighted Chancellorâs âgood connections within
Eskom.â

25. Another 2005 Hitachi document identified Chancellor as a âpotentially suitableâ
BEE partner that was âpolitically preferred.â In the documentâs margin next to the discussion of
Chancellor are handwritten notes of an HPE executive that include the words ârecommendation by
Escom [sic]â and âANC treasury.â

26. In a 2010 email, a Hitachi executive who also had served as an alternative director
of HPA in South Africa in 2005 and 2006 wrote to senior Hitachi officials in Japan: âWhen we

; adopted [Chancellor] at the time of HPA establishment, we took ANC influence into consideration

and still we believed it was a right decision.â
Case 1:15-cv-01573 Document1 Filed 09/28/15 Page 9 of 21

27. In October 2005, HPE conducted Hitachiâs due diligence of Chancellor. This due
diligence work lasted only a few daysâ time and was not conducted in accordance with any existing
Hitachi procedures. During the course of the Commissionâs investigation, Hitachi was unable to
locate its report reflecting the due diligence conducted of Chancellor.

28. On November 24, 2005, HPE formally entered into a shareholdersâ agreement with
Chancellor. Pursuant to this agreement, Hitachi â through HPE â sold Chancellor a 25% equity
stake in the newly formed HPA. Hitachi also sold a 5% equity stake in HPA to another local entity
~âasmall five-person womenâs group â with HPE maintaining the remaining 70% of the equity in
HPA. In February 2006, a public launch ceremony was held, at which HPA and its BEE
shareholders were introduced to the public.

29. The shareholdersâ agreement expressly provided that Chancellorâs âcontributionâ to
HPA would include, among other things, âlobbying the public and the private sector in the
Republic for new business and to promote [HPAâs] expansion initiatives and to enhance and/or
protect [HPAâs] existing and future business interests within the Republicâ and âassistance in the
identification, preparation, processing, monitoring, support and procuring of tenders from central,
provincial and local government, parastatals and the private sector.â

30. Hitachi charged Chancellor only approximately $190,819 for its 25% equity stake
in HPA. In addition, as part of the transaction, Chancellor obtained a seat on HPAâs board, with
Chancellorâs chairman becoming a director of HPA.

31. In an email dated April 20, 2010, an HPE executive stated, âAfter [an HPA
executive] evaluated each company, he chose ANC-related CH[ancellor] (25%) and a lady-group
(5%) G6 members then), which included the lady ... who had a good relationship with the Mbeki

Administration, to achieve 30%.â
Case 1:15-cv-01573 Document1 Filed 09/28/15 Page 10 of 21

The Undisclosed âSuccess Feeâ Arrangement

32. An October 2005 draft of the shareholdersâ agreement for HPA included a specific
provision pursuant to which Chancellor would be financially rewarded in the event that its efforts
substantially resulted in Hitachi winning a government contract.

33. In a November 1, 2005 email, an HPA executive circulated a revised draft of the
shareholdersâ agreement in which the âsuccess feeâ provision had been removed from the attached
revised draft. In the transmittal email, HPA stated that HPE âsupports the principle of rewarding
successâ but that such an arrangement âwill be dealt with in a separate document.â

34. HPA removed the âsuccess feeâ arrangement from the shareholdersâ agreement at
the direction of HPE. As HPA explained in the November 1, 2005 email, âHPA will be required to
disclose the shareholders[â] agreement when BEE audits are conducted by customers, and it is felt
that such a clause could be interpreted in a way in which it is not intended.â

35. Thereafter, Hitachi memorialized its promise to pay Chancellor for its exertion of
influence during the Eskom tender process in a separate, unsigned side-arrangement. The
arrangement was memorialized in a document entitled, Proposal for payment of success fees to
HPAâ[s] Empowerment Shareholders (the âSuccess Fee Arrangementâ), which stated, in part:

[HPE] and HPA believe in rewarding success where it is due. ...
Entitlement to payment of a success fee will be dependent upon the
active involvement and support provided to HPA during the tender /
adjudication phase of a project, and the award of an order to HPA
must be substantially as a result of [Chancellorâs] efforts within [its]
responsible sphere of influence.
36. In August 2006, an HPE executive reported to HPEâs board of directors that HPE

and HPA had agreed to a ââsuccess feeâ arrangement with its BEE partners âas an incentive to them

to help the Company win orders.â

10
Case 1:15-cv-01573 Document1 Filed 09/28/15 Page 11 of 21

After Entering into a Success Fee Arrangement with Chancellor, Hitachi Submits Tenders
for Work on Two Power Stations

37. In May 2006, Eskom invited Hitachi and other contractors to tender for work
involved in building the Medupi power station. The project included both the boiler and turbine
components of the power station. In November 2006, Hitachi â through HPE and HPA bidding in
consortium â formally tendered for work on both the boiler and turbine components. Shortly
thereafter, Hitachi withdrew its tender for the turbines for capacity reasons and proceeded with just
its tender to build the boiler works.

38. Later, in the summer of 2007, Eskom also initiated a non-tender process for the
Kusile power station and invited Hitachi to submit an offer for work on the boiler component.
Hitachi â again, through HPE and HPA bidding in consortium â then submitted its initial offer for
work on the boiler component of the Kusile power station.

39, Hitachi considered its entry into the South African power market a high corporate
priority, and HPAâs tenders for the Eskom contracts had the personal attention of Hitachiâs senior
management in Japan. On July 20, 2007, a high-level Hitachi executive wrote to the Minister of
South Africaâs Department of Public Enterprises, the ministry with oversight responsibility for
Eskom, that he and Hitachi âfully supportâ HPAâs power station tenders, and that âI am
continuously monitoring the development of the [Medupi] project.â

During the Pendency of the Eskom Tenders, the ANC Confirms that Chancellor Is an ANC
Funding Vehicle

40. While Hitachi was preparing and submitting its first tender for the Medupi power
station, the South African press publicly exposed Chancellor â with whom Hitachi had entered into
both a shareholdersâ agreement and an undisclosed âsuccess feeâ arrangement â as an alter ego of

the ANC.

11
Case 1:15-cv-01573 Document1 Filed 09/28/15 Page 12 of 21

Al. In August 2006, an HPA director received a telephone call from a reporter with the
Mail & Guardian, a South African weekly newspaper that focuses on political analysis,
investigative reporting, and South African news and culture. The reporter asked HPA to comment
on whether there was a link between HPAâs 25% shareholder, Chancellor, and the ANC. HPA
declined to comment.

42. On November 10, 2006, the same day that Hitachi submitted its bid for the Medupi
power station contract, the Mail & Guardian published an article entitled, The ANCâs New
Funding Front. The article exposed Chancellor as a business front set up by the ANC âto seek
profit on its behalf,â generally by acquiring âempowermentâ stakes in businesses seeking state
procurements. âThis means,â the Mail & Guardian stated, âthe ANC, as ruling party, has been
both player and referee.â

43. Both HPA and HPE were aware of the Mail & Guardianâs reporting on
Chancellorâs relationship to the ANC. On November 13, 2006, an HPA director forwarded two

HPE executives a copy of The ANCâs New Funding Front. The same HPA director reported to the

 

HPE executives that he had spoken to Chancellorâs chairman, who had denied the allegations in
the newspaper.

44. In January 2007, both the Mail & Guardian and a separate South African
newspaper, the Financial Mail, published articles that confirmed Chancellor was a funding vehicle
for the ANC. In Financing the ANC, published on January 19, 2007, the Financial Mail quoted
the ANC Secretary General and organizational head of the ANCâs operations as admitting that
Chancellor was an âANC vehicleâ that existed for the sole purpose of funding the ANC. The Mail
& Guardian reported this same admission by the ANC Secretary General a week later, in an article

entitled, ANC Admits It Used BEE Funding Front.

 

12
Case 1:15-cv-01573 Document1 Filed 09/28/15 Page 13 of 21

45. After the ANC Secretary General acknowledged publicly that Chancellor was an
ANC funding âvehicle,â an HPA director spoke to Chancellor's chairman, who admitted this fact.

Hitachi Continues to Encourage Chancellor to Exert Its Political Influence to Assist in
Winning the Eskom Contracts

46. Notwithstanding confirmation in the press that Chancellor was an ANC alter ego,
and thus a foreign political party, Hitachi maintained its relationship with Chancellor. As pressure
from Hitachi executives in Japan mounted, HPE and HPA continued to encourage Chancellor to
exert its political influence to win the Eskom contracts.

47. As specified in the shareholdersâ agreement, Chancellor networked to help schedule
meetings with government officials and lobbied on behalf of the HPE and HPA consortium bid.

48. On May 22, 2007, an executive at Hitachi, Ltd. Power Systems, an internal division
of Hitachi, emailed the management team of HPE that, â[g]iven the potential of the South African
market and its importance for Hitachi group, HPE together with Hitachi Power Systems Group
shall devote every effort to winning [the Medupi boiler contract].â A second email sent a week
later relayed that Hitachi in Japan was âworr[ied] about the current situation.â

49, In a May 30, 2007 email, an HPE executive emailed other Hitachi executives that,
even though HPE and HPA âhad not been successful in receiving any update [from Eskom],â
Chancellor and HPAâs 5% shareholder were doing âtheir very bestâ to bring Hitachiâs offer for the
Eskom contracts âin first place.â

50. In August 2007, Eskom issued a letter of award for the boiler and turbine
components of the Medupi power station to the only bidder competing with Hitachi, a consortium

led by a large French multinational company. :
Case 1:15-cv-01573 Document1 Filed 09/28/15 Page 14 of 21

Sl. In mid-September 2007, HPE learned that there were difficulties in the
negotiations between Eskom and the French consortium for the Medupi boiler works. HPE
directed Chancellor to help Hitachi win reconsideration of the boiler component of the Medupi
power station contract.

52. On October 8, 2007, HPE executives executed a code of conduct for HPE that,
among other things, specifically prohibited contributions to political parties and required
compliance with all laws. Despite this code of conduct, HPE continued in its relationship with
Chancellor to win government contracts from Eskom.

53. On October 15, 2007, an HPE executive emailed an internal Hitachi memorandum
on the status of the Eskom negotiations to another HPE executive. Under the headings âDecision
Criteriaâ and âMain influencing criteria,â the memorandum expressed confidence that Eskomâs
ANC-led board would favor Hitachi: âBalance of political power in board (ANC driven currently
in our favour).â

54. This prediction proved correct. On October 30, 2007, Eskom and Hitachi â through
HPE and HPA â executed the first of two contracts: a $2.91 billion contract to build the boiler
works for the Medupi power station.

55. In December 2007, the Financial Mail published another article about Hitachiâs
relationship with Chancellor. The Financial Mail quoted an HPE executive as saying that there
was âno proofâ that Chancellor was an ANC front company and if Chancellor was indeed a front-
for the ANC, âthis would contradict our own governance rules.â In fact, as Hitachi knew well
before December 2007, and as the ANCâs Secretary General had confirmed publicly eleven

months earlier, Chancellor was an alter ego of the ANC.

14
Case 1:15-cv-01573 Document1 Filed 09/28/15 Page 15 of 21

56. A week after the publication of the Financial Mail article, on December 14, 2007,
Eskom and Hitachi â through HPE and HPA ~ executed the second of two contracts: a $2.71
billion contract to build the boiler works for the Kusile power station.

57. | The Medupi and Kusile power station contracts together accounted for
approximately $5.6 billion in business being awarded to Hitachi by Eskom, among the largest
government contracts ever awarded in South African history.

HPA Pays Chancellor, an ANC Front, Over $1.1 Million in Success Fees, Declares
Substantial Dividends to Chancellor, and Inaccurately Records these Transactions in Its
Books and Records

58. On April 14, 2008, HPA held its annual shareholders meeting. As reflected in the
meeting minutes, HPA agreed to pay a success fee to Chancellor to reward Chancellor for its
assistance in helping Hitachi secure the Eskom power station contracts.

59. Subsequently, Chancellor submitted two invoices to HPA for success fees, which
Chancellor called âtender supportâ fees. On April 30, 2008, HPA paid Chancellor a success fee of
approximately $965,222, based on the Medupi and Kusile power station contracts. On July 2,
2008, HPA paid Chancellor a second success fee of approximately $158,160, based on Eskomâs
acceptance of an option to expand the Kusile power station contract by another two boilers.
Overall, HPA paid success fees to Chancellor totaling approximately $1,123,382.

60. HPA recorded the success fees in its âconsulting feesâ expense account. The
âconsulting feesâ account was included in the profit and loss line item âAdministrative and other
expensesâ in HPAâs Annual Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2008. Those
financial statements were consolidated into Hitachi's financial statements and filed with the
Commission on Hitachiâs Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009 (filed July 27,
2009).

15
Case 1:15-cv-01573 Document1 Filed 09/28/15 Page 16 of 21

61. | HPE and HPA knew that its âsuccess feeâ payments were in fact payments to the
ANC, a foreign political party. While suggesting that Hitachi was contractually committed to
make these payments, an HPA executive further explained in an August 2012 recorded interview:

One also has to be sensitive to a foreign company operating in
[South Africa] where you have been alerted to the fact that now in
fact, you actually have a political party shareholder who is in
government. Itâs difficult; we were caught between a rock and a
hard place. If we treat them really badly, who knows what can
happen? We are dealing with a state-owned enterprise where the
bosses are appointed by the ANC.

62. On October 15, 2008, HPA executives executed a code of conduct for HPA. Like
the code of conduct executed by executives at HPE a year earlier, the HPA code of conduct, among
other things, specifically prohibited contributions to political parties and required compliance with
all laws.

63. As a result of Hitachi winning the Eskom power station contracts, Chancellor, as a
25% shareholder in HPA, was entitled to receive a 25% share of future profits derived from the
contracts in the form of HPA dividends. In 2010 and 2011, HPA declared and recorded a liability
in its books and records for dividends to be paid to Chancellor. HPAâs journal entries for these
transactions did not reflect that the dividends were, in fact, amounts due for payment to a foreign
political party for its assistance in securing government contracts.

64. On March 18, 2010, HPA declared a dividend of approximately $7,032,680 for all
shareholders based on 2009 profits, of which Chancellor was due a dividend of approximately
$1,758,170.

65. On April 30, 2010, HPA recorded a journal entry for âDividends Declared 18
March 2010â as a liability, with a corresponding reduction of equity in HPAâs books and records

for the year ended December 31, 2010. This dividend declaration reflected on the books and

16
Case 1:15-cv-01573 Document1 Filed 09/28/15 Page 17 of 21

records of HPA was consolidated into Hitachiâs financial statements, and filed with the
Commission on Hitachiâs Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011 (filed June 24,
2011).

66. The following year, in March 2011, HPA declared a dividend of approximately
$13,073,300 for all shareholders based on 2010 profits, of which Chancellor was due a dividend of
approximately $3,268,325. On March 25, 2011, HPA recorded a journal entry for âDividend
Declaration based on 2010 resultsâ as a liability, with a corresponding reduction of equity in
HPAâs books and records for the year ended December 31, 2011. This dividend declaration
reflected on the books and records of HPA was consolidated into Hitachiâs financial statements for
the year ended March 31, 2012.

67. Hitachi, however, temporanly withheld payment of the 2010 and 2011 dividends to
Chancellor. In an addendum to the shareholdersâ agreement that HPE and Chancellor executed in
late May 2012, Chancellor provided its assurance that it would not pass on dividend payments
from Hitachi to any political party or official. Then, on or about June 29, 2012, Hitachi paid
Chancellor approximately $5,027,170 in what Hitachi deemed dividends and interest on such
dividends.

68. Approximately nineteen months later, in February 2014, HPE repurchased
Chancellorâs shares in HPA â shares that Chancellor had purchased in 2005 for only approximately
$190,819 â for approximately $4.4 million.

69. Thus, in total, Chancellor ~ the ANCâs funding vehicle â received approximately
$10.5 million from Hitachi, a return of over 5,000% on its investment in HPA.

70. During the time it was registered with the Commission, Hitachi failed to devise and
maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. HPE and HPA were able to enter into

17
Case 1:15-cv-01573 Document1 Filed 09/28/15 Page 18 of 21

a shareholdersâ agreement and an undisclosed âsuccess feeâ arrangement with Chancellor â a front
for the ANC â to pay that entity for exerting its political influence. Although HPE had a code of
conduct in place before the success fees were paid that specifically prohibited contributions to
political parties, HPA paid Chancellor more than $1.1 million pursuant to this side-arrangement.
HPA was able to do so despite a stream of reporting in the South African media that publicized the
fact that HPAâs 25% shareholder was a funding vehicle for the ANC.

71. HPA also was able to record Chancellorâs invoices for success fee payments as
âconsultingâ expenses, which they were not, without proper documentation or reasonable detail.
Hitachiâs internal accounting controls failed again when Hitachi declared and recorded as
dividends to be paid to Chancellor transactions that, in fact, would instead be payments to a foreign
political party for its assistance in securing government contracts. Among other further internal
accounting controls deficiencies, Hitachi failed to conduct adequate due diligence of Chancellor, a
potential agent and a potential shareholder of HPA, and to keep records of such due diligence, even
though Hitachi intended for Chancellor to use its political influence to help obtain government
contracts.

72. Hitachiâs internal accounting controls, or lack thereof, also were inadequate to
provide reasonable assurances that Hitachi would not violate its own codes of conduct and
compliance policies, the FCPA, or South African law. For example, Hitachi failed to adequately
supervise and ensure compliance with its policies and procedures, and neither HPE nor HPA
conducted any FCPA-specific compliance training during the time period in which Hitachi â
through HPE and HPA â was seeking lucrative contracts with an instrumentality of a foreign

government and authorizing the payments of âsuccess feesâ to a foreign political party.

Defendant.

 

CONSENT OF DEFENDANT HITACHI, LTD.

L. Defendant Hitachi, Ltd. (âDefendantâ or âHitachiâ) waives service of a summons
and the complaint in this action, enters a general appearance, and admits the Court's jurisdiction
over Defendant and over the subject matter of this action.

2. Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint (except as provided
herein in Paragraph 11 and except as to personal and subject matter jurisdiction, which
Defendant admits), Defendant hereby consents to the entry of the final Judgment in the form
attached hereto (the âFinal Judgmentâ) and incorporated by reference herein, which, among other
things:

(a) permanently restrains and enjoins Defendant from violations of Sections
13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
âExchange Actâ) [15 U.S.C. 8Â§ 78m(b){(2)(A) and 78m(b)(2)(B)]; and

(b) orders Defendant to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $19,000,000

under Section 21(d)(3) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78u(d)(3)].
Case 1:15-cv-01573 Document 1-2 Filed 09/28/15 Page 2 of 8

3, Defendant agrees that it shall not seek or accept, directly or indirectly,
reimbursement or indemnification from any source, including but not limited to payment made
pursuant to any insurance policy, with regard to any civil penalty amounts that Defendant pays
pursuant to the Final Judgment, regardless of whether such penalty amounts or any part thereof
are added to a distribution fund or otherwise used for the benefit of investors. Defendant further
agrees that it shall not claim, assert, or apply for a tax deduction or tax credit for any penalty
amounts that Defendant pays pursuant to the Final Judgment, regardless of whether such penalty
amounts or any part thereof are added to a distribution fund or otherwise used for the benefit of
investors,

4. Detendant waives the entry of findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to
Rule 52 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

5. Defendant waives the right, if any, to a jury trial and to appeal from the entry of
the Final Judgment.

6. Defendant enters into this Consent voluntarily and represents that no threats,
offers, promises, or inducements of any kind have been made by the Commission or any
member, officer, employee, agent, or representative of the Commission to induce Defendant to
enter into this Consent.

7. Defendant agrees that this Consent shall be incorporated into the Final Judgment
with the same force and effect as if fully set forth therein.

8. Defendant will not oppose the enforcement of the Final Judgment on the ground,
if any exists, that it fails to comply with Rule 65(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and

hereby waives any objection based thereon.

ht

 
Case 1:15-cv-01573 Document 1-2 Filed 09/28/15 Page 3 of 8

9. Defendant waives service of the Final Judgment and agrees that entry of the Final
Judgment by the Court and filing with the Clerk of the Court will constitute notice to Defendant
of its terms and conditions. Defendant further agrees to provide counsel for the Commission,
within thirty days after the Final Judgment is filed with the Clerk of the Court, with an affidavit
or declaration stating that Defendant has received and read a copy of the Final Judgment.

10. Consistent with 17 C.F.R. Â§ 202.5), this Consent resolves only the claims
asserted against Defendant in this civil proceeding. Defendant acknowledges that no promise or
representation has been made by the Commission or any member, officer, employee, agent, or
representative of the Commission with regard to any criminal liability that may have arisen or
may arise from the facts underlying this action or immunity from any such criminal lability.
Defendant waives any claim of Double Jeopardy based upon the settlement of this proceeding,
including the imposition of any remedy or civil_penalty herein. Defendant further acknowledges
that the Courtâs entry of a permanent injunction may have collateral consequences under federal
or state law and the rules and regulations of self-regulatory organizations, licensing boards, and
other regulatory organizations. Such collateral consequences include, but are not limited to, a
statutory disqualification with respect to membership or participation in, or association with a
member of, a self-regulatory organization. This statutory disqualification has consequences that
are separate from any sanction imposed in an administrative proceeding. In addition, in any
disciplinary proceeding before the Commission based on the entry of the injunction in this
action, Defendant understands that it shall not be permitted to contest the factual allegations of
the complaint in this action.

1h, Defendant understands and agrees to comply with the terms of 17 C.F.R.

Â§ 202.5(e), which provides in part that it is the Commissionâs policy ânot to permit a defendant
Case 1:15-cv-01573 Document 1-2 Filed 09/28/15 Page 4 of 8

or respondent to consent to a judgment or order that imposes a sanction while denying the
allegations in the complaint or order for proceedings,â and âa refusal to admit the allegations is
equivalent to a denial, unless the defendant or respondent states that he neither admits nor denies
the allegations.â As part of Defendantâs agreement to comply with the terms of Section 202.5(e),
Defendant: (1) will not take any action or make or permit to be made any public statement
denying, directly or indirectly, any allegation in the complaint or creating the impression that the
complaint is without factual basis; (ii) will not make or permit to be made any public statement
to the effect that Defendant does not admit the allegations of the complaint, or that this Consent
contains no admission of the allegations, without also stating that Defendant does not deny the
allegations; and (iii) upon the filing of this Consent, Defendant hereby withdraws any papers
filed in this action to the extent that they deny any allegation in the complaint. [f Defendant
breaches this agreement, the Commission may petition the Court to vacate the Final Judgment
and restore this action to its active docket. Nothing in this paragraph affects Defendant's: (i)
testimonial obligations; or (ii) right to take legal or factual positions in litigation or other legal
proceedings in which the Commission is not a party.

12. Defendant hereby waives any rights under the Equal Access to Justice Act, the
Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, or any other provision of law to
seek from the United States, or any agency, or any official of the United States acting in his or
her official capacity, directly or indirectly, reimbursement of attorney's fees or other fees,
expenses, or costs expended by Defendant to defend against this action. For these purposes,
Defendant agrees that Defendant is not the prevailing party in this action since the parties have

reached a good faith settlement.
Case 1:15-cv-01573 Document 1-2 Filed 09/28/15 Page 5of8

13. In connection with this action and any related judicial or administrative
proceeding or investigation commenced by the Commission or to which the Commission is a
party, Defendant (i) agrees to appear and be interviewed by Commission staff at such times and
places as the staff requests upon reasonable notice; (il) will accept service by mail or facsimile
transmission of notices or subpoenas issued by the Commission for documents or testimony at
depositions, hearings, or trials, or in connection with any related investigation by Commission
staff; (111) appoints Defendantâs undersigned attorney as agent to receive service of such notices
and subpoenas; (iv) with respect to such notices and subpoenas, waives the territorial limits on
service contained in Rule 45 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and any applicable local
rules, provided that the party requesting the testimony reimburses Defendant's travel, lodging, and
subsistence expenses at the then-prevailing U.S. Government per diem rates; and (v) consents to
personal jurisdiction over Defendant in any United States District Court for purposes of
enforcing any such subpoena.

14, Defendant agrees that the Commission may present the Final Judgment to the

Court for signature and entry without further notice.
