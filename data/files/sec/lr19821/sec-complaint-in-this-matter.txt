SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS

2. Steven Ott, the former Vice President for Global Sales of ITXC, and
Roger Michael Young, ITXCâs former Managing Director for the Middle East and
Africa, violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the âFCPAâ),
which is codified as Section 30A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange
Actâ) [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78dd-1], by making and approving bribes paid to foreign government
officials in Nigeria, Rwanda, and Senegal between August 2001 and May 2004. Ott and
Young approved ITXCâs wire transfers totaling $267,468.95 to senior officials at the
following foreign government-owned telephone companies: Nigerian
Telecommunications Limited (âNitelâ), Rwandatel S.A. (ââRwandatelââ), and La SociÃ©tÃ©
Nationale des TÃ©lÃ©communications du SÃ©nÃ©gal (âSonatelâ). During the period in which
these payments were made, ITXC obtained or retained contracts with these carriers that
generated profits totaling at least $11,509,733.

3, By disguising the payments of bribes on ITXCâs books as legitimate
expenses through the creation of false business records, defendants violated the books
and records and internal control provisions of Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) and
Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78m(b)(5) and 17 C.F.R. Â§ 240.13b2-1], and
aided and abetted ITXCâs violations of the books and records and internal control
provisions of Exchange Act Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§
78m(b)(2)(A) and 78m(b)(2)(B)].

4. Defendants may, unless restrained and enjoined, continue to engage in the

acts and practices set forth in this complaint and courses of conduct of similar object and

purport.
JURISDICTION

5. The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to the FCPA [15
U.S.C. Â§ 78dd-1], Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78aa], and 28 U.S.C.
Â§ 1331.

6. The Commission brings this action pursuant to Sections 21(d) and 21(e) of
the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78u(d) and (e)].

7. Defendants, directly or indirectly, made use of the means and
instrumentalities of interstate commerce or of the mails in connection with the acts,

practices, and courses of business alleged herein.

OTHER RELEVANT PARTIES

10. ITXC was an international telecommunications carrier based in Princeton,
New Jersey. ITXCâs business consisted of selling the ability to place telephone calls to
individuals in as many as 232 foreign countries. ITXC ceased to exist as a separate entity
on June 1, 2004, when it merged with Teleglobe International Holdings Ltd.
(âTeleglobeâ). Prior to the merger with Teleglobe, ITXCâs common stock was registered
with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act and was quoted on
NASDAQ. Teleglobeâs common stock was similarly registered with the Commission
pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act and was quoted on NASDAQ until
February 13, 2006. On that date, Teleglobe was acquired by Videsh Sanchar Nigam
Limited (âVSNLâ). VSNL has securities registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange
Act that trade on the New York Stock Exchange as American Depositary Receipts.

11.  =Nitel is the dominant telephone company in Nigeria. Nitel is, and always
has been, wholly-owned by the government of Nigeria.

12. | Rwandatel is the dominant telephone company in Rwanda. Rwandatel is,
and always has been, wholly-owned by the government of Rwanda.

13. Sonatel is the dominant telephone company in Senegal. During the
relevant time period for this complaint, Sonatel was partially owned by, and an
instrumentality of, the government of Senegal.

14. Yaw Osei Amoako is a resident of Hillsboro, New Jersey. He began his
employment with ITXC in 1999 and was terminated for cause on August 19, 2004.
During the relevant time period, Amoako was the Regional Director for Africa at ITXC.
His responsibilities included negotiating contracts between ITXC and telephone
companies in Africa. Amoako reported directly to Young and indirectly to Ott. The
Commission filed a related complaint against Amoako on September 1, 2005 for his
involvement in the bribery scheme alleged herein (see SEC v. Yaw Osei Amoako, Civ.

No. 05-4284 (GEB) (D.N.J.)).
FACTS

15. ITXC sought from Nitel, Rwandatel, and Sonatel the right to place
telephone calls to individuals and businesses in Nigeria, Rwanda, and Senegal,
respectively. These carriers do not grant such rights liberally. Rather, they carefully
restrict access to their customers in order to increase the fees that they can charge foreign
telecommunications carriers for placing such calls. To overcome this barrier to entry,
defendants Ott and Young, and their subordinate Amoako, engaged in the bribery scheme
described below.

A. Bribes in Nigeria

16. In2000, ITXC competed against other international telecommunications
carriers to obtain a contract with Nitel that would have allowed ITXCâs customers to call
Nitelâs customers (such contracts are generically known as âcarrier contractsâ). Amoako
was the ITXC salesperson who, at the direction of Ott and Young, traveled to Nigeria to
present ITXCâs contract bid. To facilitate his efforts, Amoako hired as an agent a former
senior official of Nitel. However, the strategy backfired: the former Nitel official
irritated the current Nitel decision-makers. In the end, Amoako was unsuccessful and
Nitel awarded the carrier contract to one of ITXCâs competitors.

17. In mid-2002, Nitel opened the bidding for four new carrier contracts and
specifically invited ITXC to participate. Ott and Young instructed Amoako to return to
Nigeria in the summer of 2002 to present ITXCâs bid to Nitel. However, this time
Amoako â with the full knowledge and approval of Ott and Young â offered a Nitel
Deputy General Manager the opportunity to be ITXCâs agent (hereinafter âthe Nitel
Agentâ). As Amoako knew, and told his superiors, the Nitel Agent was one of the key
decision-makers at Nitel who was to select the four bidders to receive the new carrier
contracts. Amoako, at the direction of Ott and Young, promised the Nitel Agent a hefty

âretainerâ and a cut of ITXCâs profits if the Nitel Agent steered one of the carrier
contracts to ITXC. ITXC, Ott, Young, and Amoako hired the Nitel Agent for the sole
purpose of obtaining, and then retaining, business with Nitel.

18. The decision to hire an inside agent paid off. Nitel granted a carrier
contract to ITXC, which the parties signed on October 25, 2002 (hereinafter âNitel
Carrier Agreementâ). Less than three weeks later, on November 12, 2002, the Nitel
Agent signed a formal agreement to be ITXCâs agent. Ott signed that agreement on
behalf of ITXC. The agreement, which the Nitel Agent signed as the CEO of an
otherwise non-existent corporation, granted the Nitel Agent the right to a percentage of
ITXCâs profits from the Nitel Carrier Agreement.

19. The agreement with the Nitel Agent called for ITXC to pay his company a
âretainerâ of $10,000. Ott approved two $5,000 payments that ITXC made to the Nitel
Agentâs company on November 21, 2002 and January 10, 2003. ITXC made these
payments through wire transfers from its account at PNC Bank in New Jersey to.the
account of the Nitel Agentâs company at Intercontinental Bank PLC in Nigeria.

20. ITXC failed to pay the Nitel Agent his cut of ITXCâs profits throughout
most of 2003. To repair the relationship with the Nitel Agent, and to obtain a favorable
settlement with Nitel on another issue, Young negotiated and Ott approved a payment of
$150,000 (which was almost six times what the Nitel Agent had actually earned under the
agreement) to the Nitel Agentâs company on December 23, 2003. ITXC made this
payment through a wire transfer from its account at PNC Bank in New Jersey to the
account of the Nitel Agentâs company at Intercontinental Bank PLC in Nigeria.

21. On May 27, 2004, Ott and Young approved a payment to the Nitel
Agentâs company of $6,541.31, which represented the Nitel Agentâs share of ITXCâs
profits from the Nitel Carrier Agreement for the year to date. ITXC made this payment
through a wire transfer from its account at PNC Bank in New Jersey to the account of the

Nitel Agentâs company at Intercontinental Bank PLC in Nigeria.
22. Ott and Young caused ITXC to record the foregoing payments to the Nitel
Agent as legitimate expenses on ITXCâs books and records.

23. The total amount of the payments to the Nitel Agent that Ott and Young
negotiated and/or approved was $166,541.31. At all relevant times, Ott and Young knew
that the Nitel Agent was an employee of the foreign government-owned Nitel. The sole
purpose of the payments was to influence the Nitel Agent, a foreign official, to steer the
Nitel Carrier Agreement to ITXC and thereby enable it to obtain and retain business with
Nitel.

24. There was no legitimate purpose for the payments. In fact, as a result of
the agreement with the Nitel Agent, ITXC earned profits of $1,136,618 from selling
telephone service to customers calling Nigeria. ITXC could not have made such sales
without having the Nitel Carrier Agreement that resulted from the bribes paid to the Nitel
Agent.

B. Bribes in Rwanda

25. At the direction of defendants Ott and Young, Amoako negotiated with an
employee of Rwandatel in February 2002 to obtain a carrier agreement between ITXC
and Rwandatel. With the full knowledge and approval of Ott and Young, Amoako
promised to compensate the Rwandatel employee as an agent of ITXC if he would
influence Rwandatel to agree to favorable terms for the exchange of telecommunications
traffic with ITXC. The Rwandatel employee agreed and became ITXCâs agent
(hereinafter âthe Rwandatel Agentâ).

26. On February 28, 2002, Rwandatel and ITXC entered an agreement to
exchange telecommunications traffic (hereinafter the âRwandatel Carrier Agreementâ),
which the Rwandatel Agent signed as an employee of Rwandatel.

27.  OnJuly 2, 2002, ITXC entered into a formal agent agreement with the
Rwandatel Agent, which defendant Ott signed on behalf of ITXC. The agreement

entitled the Rwandatel Agent to $0.01 for each minute of telephone traffic that ITXC was
able to complete to telephone subscribers in Rwanda (as well as in Burundi and Uganda
where Rwandatel had the right to complete telephone calls) under the Rwandatel Carrier
Agreement. Pursuant to the agent agreement, Ott and Young approved a payment to the
Rwandatel Agent of $26,155.11 on September 11, 2002. ITXC made this payment
through a wire transfer from its account at PNC Bank in New Jersey to the account of the
Rwandatel Agent at Standard Chartered Bank in Dubai.

28. Ott and Young caused ITXC improperly to record the foregoing payment
to the Rwandatel Agent as a legitimate expense on ITXCâs books and records.

29. At all relevant times, Ott and Young knew that the Rwandatel Agent was
an employee of the foreign government-owned Rwandatel. The sole purpose of the
payment was to influence the Rwandatel Agent, a foreign official, to steer the Rwandatel
Carrier Agreement to ITXC and thereby enable it to obtain and retain business with
Rwandatel.

30. There was no legitimate purpose for the payment. In fact, as a result of
the agreement with the Rwandatel Agent, ITXC earned profits of $217,418 from selling
telephone service to customers calling Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda. ITXC could not
have made such sales without having the Rwandatel Carrier Agreement that resulted from
the bribes paid to the Rwandatel Agent.

C. Bribes in Senegal

31. In November 2001, Ott and Amoako traveled to Senegal to negotiate a
carrier agreement between ITXC and Sonatel. Ott and Amoako negotiated with a certain
employee of Sonatel who later became an agent: for ITXC (hereinafter âthe Sonatel
Agentâ). Amoako, with the full knowledge and approval of Ott and Young, promised the
Sonatel Agent that ITXC would pay him a percentage of ITXCâs revenues if he
persuaded his employer to enter a telecommunications traffic exchange agreement with

ITXC.
32. Negotiations between ITXC and Sonatel continued through February
2001, when the parties executed a traffic exchange agreement on February 22, 2001
(hereinafter the âSonatel Carrier Agreementâ).

33. On March 15, 2001, ITXC entered a formal agency agreement with the
Sonatel Agent, which defendant Ott signed on ITXCâs behalf. The agreement entitled the
Sonatel Agent to a percentage of ITXCâs revenues associated with the Sonatel Carrier
Agreement. Toward that end, Ott and Young approved a series of payments that ITXC
made to the Sonatel Agent between August 2001 and October 2003 totaling

approximately $74,772, which are summarized in the table below:

$4779.19 7/25/2003
$7175.19 10/29/2003

 

 

 

ITXC made these payments through wire transfers from its account at PNC Bank in New
Jersey to the account of the Sonatel Agent at SocietÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale du Banque in Paris,
France.

34. Ott and Young caused ITXC improperly to record the foregoing payments
to the Sonatel Agent as legitimate expenses on ITXCâs books and records.

35. Atall relevant times, Ott and Young knew that the Sonatel Agent was an

employee of the foreign government-owned Sonatel. The sole purpose of these payments
was to influence the Sonatel Agent, a foreign official, to steer the Sonatel Carrier
Agreement to ITXC and thereby enable it to obtain and retain business with Sonatel.
36. There was no legitimate purpose for the payments. In fact, as a result of
the agreement with the Sonatel Agent, ITXC earned profits of $10,155,696 from selling
telephone service to customers calling Senegal. ITXC could not have made such sales
without having the Sonatel Carrier Agreement that resulted from the bribes paid to the

Sonatel Agent.
