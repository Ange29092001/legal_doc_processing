COMPLAINT

Plaintiff U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the âCommissionâ) alleges:

SUMMARY

1. This matter concerns violations of the anti-bribery, books and records, and
internal control provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (âFCPAâ) by Diebold,
Inc. (âDieboldâ), an Ohio company that is a global provider of automated teller machines
(âATMsâ) and bank security systems. From 2005 through 2010, Diebold, through its
agents and subsidiaries, lavished international leisure trips, entertainment, and other
improper gifts on foreign officials to obtain and retain lucrative business with
government owned banks in China and Indonesia. During that same period, Diebold,

through its Russian subsidiary, paid bribes in connection with the sale of ATMs to private
banks in Russia. In all, Diebold made approximately $3 million in illicit payments in

China, Russia, and Indonesia.

2. From 2005 through 2010, through its subsidiary Diebold Financial
Equipment Company (China), Ltd. (âDiebold Chinaâ), Diebold provided international
leisure trips and entertainment to officials of government owned banks in China. This
included trips to Europe, with stays in Paris, Amsterdam, Florence, Rome, and other
European cities, and trips to the United States, with travel to the Grand Canyon, Napa
Valley, Disneyland, Las Vegas, and other popular tourist destinations. Diebold spent
approximately $ 1.6 million on leisure trips, entertainment, and other improper gifts for
government bank officials in China. During this same time period, through its subsidiary
P.T. Diebold Indonesia (âDiebold Indonesiaâ), Diebold spent over $147,000 on leisure
trips and entertainment for officials of government owned banks in Indonesia. Diebold
executives in charge of the companyâs operations in Asia knew of these improper
practices. The illicit payments were falsely recorded in Dieboldâs books and records as

training or other legitimate business expenses.

3. From 2005 through 2008, through its subsidiary Diebold Self-Service Ltd.
(âDiebold Russiaâ), Diebold also paid bribes on the sale of ATMs to private banks in
Russia. These bribes, which totaled approximately $1.2 million, were funneled through a
Diebold distributor in Russia. Diebold Russia executed phony service contracts with its

distributor to hide and falsely record the payments as legitimate business expenses.

4. Diebold, through its agents and subsidiaries, violated Section 30A of the

Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ) [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78dd-1] by providing
leisure travel and other improper gifts to foreign officials to obtain and retain business
with government owned banks in China and Indonesia. Diebold violated Section
13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act by failing to have internal controls in place to detect and
prevent those improper payments, and the improper payments to employees of private
banks in Russia. Diebold violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act by falsely
recording all of these improper payments as legitimate business expenses in the
companyâs books and records.
JURISDICTION

5. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 21(d), 21(e),
and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78u(d), 78u(e) and78aa]. Diebold, directly or
indirectly, made use of the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce, of the
mails, or of the facilities of a national securities exchange in connection with the
transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business alleged in this Complaint.

6. Venue is appropriate in this Court under Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15
U.S.C. Â§ 78aa] or 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1391(d).

FACTS

Corrupt Payments in China

15. Diebold sells ATMs and related services to government owned banks in
China. From at least 2005 through 2010, Diebold, through its subsidiary Diebold China,
provided international leisure trips, entertainment, and other improper gifts to foreign
officials for the purpose of obtaining and retaining business with government owned
banks in China. These illicit payments totaled approximately $1.6 million. Examples of
international leisure trips that Diebold provided to government bank officials in China are
described in paragraphs 16-23.

16. In 2005, Diebold paid for a fifteen-day leisure trip to the U.S. for two
officials from Bank A, a bank owned and controlled by the government of China. This
trip included travel to Universal Studios and Disneyland in Los Angeles, Las Vegas, the
Grand Canyon, Washington, DC, New York City, San Francisco, and Hawaii.

17. In 2006, Diebold paid for a twelve-day trip to Europe for eight officials
from Bank B, a bank owned and controlled by the government of China. This was a
leisure and sightseeing trip to Rome, Italy, and Stockholm, Sweden.

18. Also in 2006, Diebold paid for a two-week leisure trip to Australia and
New Zealand for five officials from Bank C, a bank owned and controlled by the
government of China.

19. In 2007, Diebold paid for a two-week trip to France for thirteen Bank A
employees. While purportedly for training at Dieboldâs offices, the primary purpose of

the trip was leisure.
20.  In2008, Diebold paid for a two-week leisure trip to Europe for eight
officials of Bank D, a bank owned and controlled by the government of China. The trip
included travel to Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam, Cologne, Frankfurt, Munich, Salzburg,
Vienna, Klagenfurt, Venice, Florence, and Rome.

21. Also in 2008, Diebold paid for a two-week leisure trip to the U.S. for three
officials from Bank E, a bank owned and controlled by the government of China.

22. Also in 2008, Diebold paid for a two-week leisure trip for ten employees
of Bank F, a bank owned and controlled by the government of China. This trip included
travel to Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, and Bali.

23. In 2009, Diebold paid for a two-week trip to the U.S. for twenty-four Bank
A employees that included travel to Chicago; to Las Vegas for sightseeing, a dance show,
and tour of the Grand Canyon; to Los Angeles for a tour of Universal Studios; to San
Diego and San Francisco, which included a tour of Napa Valley.

24. In addition to the leisure trips and entertainment, Diebold China also
provided government bank officials in China with other improper gifts. This included
cash gifts ranging from less than $100 to over $600 that were given to dozens of officials
annually.

25. | Many of the government bank employees who received these leisure trips
and other improper gifts were senior officials who had the ability to influence purchasing
decisions by the banks.

26. Diebold lacked sufficient internal controls to detect and prevent these

illicit payments, many of which were paid to third-parties in China. All of the illicit
payments were falsely recorded in the companyâs books and records as training or other
legitimate business expenses.

27. Diebold executives in charge of the companyâs operations in Asia knew
that Diebold China was providing international leisure trips and other improper gifts to
Chinese bank officials. This included Executive A, Dieboldâs former Executive Vice
President for International Operations, and Executive B, Dieboldâs former Vice President
for the Asia Pacific region. During their tenure at Diebold, Executive A and Executive B
knew that Diebold China was providing international leisure trips, entertainment, and
other improper gifts to Chinese bank officials. At times these executives personally
approved the illicit payments and accompanied government officials on these trips. Even
after these Diebold executives received FCPA training administered by the company in
2007, they took no action to halt these improper practices. Instead, these executives took
further steps to hide the leisure nature of these trips including, on at least one occasion,
providing false information to the companyâs auditors in China.

28. | Other executives at Diebold were on notice of potential corruption issues
at Diebold China. In 2007, a regional government agency in China, the Chengdu
Administration of Industry & Commerce (âCDAICâ), opened an investigation involving,
among other issues, leisure trips and gifts Diebold China had provided to bank officials.
Company executives in China and the U.S. learned of the investigation after a Diebold
field office in Chengdu was raided by authorities. Executives A and B took the lead in
responding to the investigation. Diebold was able to settle the matter with no corruption
charges filed, by paying CDAIC an administrative penalty of 600,000 RMB

(approximately $80,000) for business registration violations. Despite being on notice of
potential corruption issues at Diebold China, Diebold failed to effectively investigate and
remediate these problems.

29. From 2005 through 2010, Diebold generated approximately $265 million
in revenues from sales to government owned banks in China whose officials received

international leisure travel, entertainment, and other improper gifts by the company.

Corrupt Payments in Indonesia

30. Diebold sells ATMs and related products and services to government
owned banks in Indonesia. From 2005 through 2010, through its subsidiary Diebold
Indonesia, Diebold provided leisure trips and entertainment to officials of government
owned banks in Indonesia. Diebold Indonesia spent approximately $147,000 on leisure
trips and entertainment for officials from three government owned banks in Indonesia:
Bank X, Bank Y, and Bank Z. The purpose of providing these leisure trips was to assist
Diebold in obtaining business with these government banks. For example, in one email
exchange in 2009, a Diebold Indonesia employee sought approval from his supervisor to
pay for a leisure trip to Europe for officials of Bank X. The supervisor approved the
payment and responded: âMake this trip successful for upcoming bid too!â

31. As in China, Diebold lacked effective internal controls to detect and
prevent payment for these leisure trips for government bank officials, and the payments
were falsely recorded in Dieboldâs books and records as training costs. During this time
period, Diebold generated approximately $16 million in revenues from sales to
government owned banks in Indonesia whose officials were provided leisure trips and

entertainment by the company.
False Books and Records in Russia

32. During the relevant period, Diebold, through its subsidiary Diebold
Russia, sold ATMs to banks in Russia and Ukraine. In Russia, the company sold ATMs
both directly, and through independent distributors. Between 2005 and 2008, Diebold
Russia paid at least $1.2 million in bribes through Distributor A, a private Russian
company, to employees of privately held banks in Russia. These bribes were funneled
through Distributor A using phony service contracts that Diebold Russia executed with
Distributor A. Distributor A did not perform any services pursuant to these contracts.
Rather, Distributor A passed along the payments it received under these contracts to
employees of the private banks to which Diebold Russia was selling ATMs. Diebold
lacked sufficient internal controls to detect and prevent these illicit payments, all of
which were falsely recorded in the companyâs books and records as legitimate business
expenses.

33. | Asearly as 2007, Diebold was on notice of corruption issues involving
Diebold Russiaâs use of distributors in this region. In 2007, Diebold was seeking to
acquire Distributor B, a Ukrainian company that was an independent distributor of
Diebold products in Ukraine. During due diligence, executives at Diebold, including
Executive A and certain executives in the companyâs legal and corporate development
offices learned that Distributor B had previously made illicit payments to employees of
its bank customers. Diebold was unable to determine whether these illicit payments
involved sales of Diebold products. While Diebold did not move forward with the
acquisition, without taking any further steps to investigate and remediate these corruption

issues, Diebold continued to do business with Distributor B until 2010.
34. Similarly, in 2009, Diebold was seeking to acquire Distributor A, its
largest independent distributor in Russia and Ukraine. During due diligence, evidence
emerged that Distributor A potentially had made illicit payments in connection with its
business. Diebold continued doing business with Distributor A, and continued moving
forward with its planned acquisition. Only later, in 2010, after evidence emerged that
Distributor A had also been funneling bribe payments on behalf of Diebold Russia, did
the company terminate its business dealings and acquisition plan with Distributor A.
