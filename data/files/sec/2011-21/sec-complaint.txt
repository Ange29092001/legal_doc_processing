COMPLAINT
Plaintiff, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the âCommissionâ), alleges:
SUMMARY

1. This action arises from widespread bribery of foreign officials by
Innospec, Inc., some of which occurred and was approved by Paul W. Jennings
(âJenningsâ) beginning in mid to late 2004 during his tenure as Chief Financial Officer
(âCFOâ) and continuing after he became Chief Executive Officer (âCEOâ) in 2005.
From 2000 to 2008, Innospec, Inc., a manufacturer and distributor of fuel additives and
| . other specialty chesitienis. routinely paid bribes to government officials in order ts sell |
TEL, a fuel additive, which boosts the octane value of gasoline: to saventimedit owned
refineries and oil companies in Iraq and Indonesia. TEL is a sunset product because â
worldwide use of TEL has declined since 1973 following the enactment of the U.S. Clean

Air Act of 1970 and similar legislation in other countries. Innospec engaged in bribery to
maintain its TEL business, which accounted for significant revenue during the relevant
time period.

2 Innospecâs known bribery activities in Iraq began with its participation in
the United Nations (âUNâ) Oil for Food Program in 2001, and extended all the way until
at least 2008. Innospec also paid bribes to government officials in Indonesia beginning
as early as 2000, and continued until 2005, when Indonesiaâs need for TEL ended.
Innospecâs internal controls failed to detect the illicit conduct, which continued for nearly
adecade. Beginning in mid to late 2004, Jennings, who held various senior roles at
Innospec, including CFO.and CEO, actively participated in the bribery schemes in Iraq
and Indonesia.

3. In all, between 2000 and 2008, Innospec made illicit payments of
approximately $6,347,588 and promised an additional $2,870,377 in illicit payments to
Iraqi ministries and government officials as well as Indonesian government officials in
exchange for contracts worth approximately $176,717,341 in revenues and profits of
$60,071,613.

4. Jennings violated Section 30A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(âExchange Actâ) by engaging in widespread bribery of government officials in Iraq
during the post-Oil for Food period in order to sell TEL to the Iraqi Ministry of Oil
(âMoOâ) and by engaging in bribery of Indonesian officials to-sell TEL to state owned
oil companies in Indonesia. Jennings aided and abetted Innospecâs violations of Section
30A by substantially assisting in Innospecâs bribery of Iraqi and Indonesian government

officials.
5. Innospec, a U.S. issuer, made use of U.S. mails and interstate commerce to
carry out the scheme, and Jennings, a dual U.S. and U.K. national was complicit in the
scheme. Jennings both sent and received e-mails to and from the United States to
carryout the scheme. He also used interstate commerce and the mails as part of the
scheme. Jennings obtained $116,092 in bonuses that were tied to the success of the TEL
sales, which were procured through bribery.

6. Jennings also violated Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rule
13b2-1 thereunder by falsifying documents as part of the bribery scheme. Jennings also
violated Exchange Act Rule 13b2-2 by making false statements to accountants and
violated Exchange Act Rule 13a-14 by signing false personal certifications required by
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 that were attached to annual and quarterly Innospec
public filings.

7. Jennings also aided and abetted Innospecâs violations of Sections
13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act by substantially assisting in Innospecâs
failure to maintain internal controls to detect and prevent bribery of officials in Iraq and

âIndonesia, and the improper recording of the illicit payments in Innospecâs books and
records.
JURISDICTION

8. This Court has jurisdiction over this action under Sections 21(d), 21(e),
and 27 of the Exchange.Act [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78u(d), 78u(e) and 78aa]. Innospec, Jennings,
and others directly or indirectly, made use of the means or instrumentalities of interstate
commerce, of the mails, or of the facilities of a national securities exchange in connection

with the transactions, acts, practices, and-courses of business alleged in this Complaint.
9. Venue is appropriate in this Court under Section 27 of the Exchange Act

[15 U.S.C. Â§ 78aa] or 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1391(d).
DEFENDANT

10. Paul W. Jennings, a dual citizen of the United Kingdom and the United
States (as of December 2002), joined Innospec in November 2002. From November
2002 to 2005, Jennings was the Chief Financial Officer of Innospec. Jennings became
head of the TEL unit in April 2004 and held the position through 2006. He was also the
interim CEO of Innospec beginning in April 2005 and in June 2005 he became the
permanent CEO and President of Innospec. Jennings resigned from Innospec on March

FACTS

L BRIBERY OF IRAQI OFFICIALS IN CONNECTION WITH TEL SALES

29.  Innospecâs bribery in Iraq began as early as 2000 when Innospec paid

kickbacks to Iraq in order to secure five contracts under the United Nations Oil for Food
Program.â Jennings was not involved in the Oi for Food kickback scheme. Jennings
joined Innospec as the Chief Financial Officer in November 2002. Jennings learned of
the longstanding practice of paying bribes to obtain TEL orders in mid to late 2004. in
2004, Jennings assumed the role of head of the TEL unit in addition to his role as CFO.
Executive B, the former Chief Executive Officer of Innospec, informed Jennings that
Innospec paid kickbacks during the Oil for Food Program and that Innospec was engaged â
in ongoing bribery to obtain TEL orders. At the time, Jennings reported to Executive B.
After Executive Bâs departure in 2005, Jennings became the interim CEO replacing
Executive B and became the permanent CEO and President of Innospec in June 2005.
- Beginning in mid to late 2004, Jennings actively participated in authorizing and
approving bribery payments.Â°

| 30. Beginning in 2005, Jennings, along with other members of Innospecâs
management, approved bribery payments to officials at the Iraqi Ministry of Oil (âMoOâ)
in order to sell TEL to Iraq through its Swiss subsidiary, Alcor Chemie Vertriebs GMBH

(âAlcorâ). Innospec used its agent, Naaman, to funnel the payments to Iraqi officials.

 

5 The Oil for Food Program was intended to provide humanitarian relief for the Iraqi population,
which faced severe hardship under the international trade sanctions that followed Iraqâs 1990 invasion of
Kuwait. The Program permitted the Iraqi government to sell its crude oil-and use the Proceeds to piusehgte
food, medicine, and critical infrastructure supplies through a U. N: Escrow Account maintained in New. â
York. Corruption was rampant within the Program. By: mid-2000: Traqi- ministries, âon the instruction of top
government officials, including Saddam Hussein, demanded companies pay aten percent kickback on each
âcontract. This kickback was euphemistically referred to as an âafter-sales serviceâ fee; however, no
services were provided. In all, Innospec paid kickbacks of $1,853,754 and offered additional kickbacks of
$1,985,897 to Iraq, earning revenues of approximately $45,804,915 on the five Oil for Food contracts and
profits of $23,125,820:

6 Although Jennings was not involved in the payment of kickbacks during the Oil for Food
Program, Jennings was aware that ASSF payments had been made and that the companyâs auditors had
raised questions about the ASSF payments. After learning that Innospec had paid bribes in connection with
the Oil for Food Program, Jennings did not inform the auditors of this information. Jennings was also
aware that Iraqi oil officials who originally demanded the kickbacks in the form of ASSFs in 2003
continued demanding that Innospec pay two ASSF payments that were never made due to the invasion of
Iraq by U.S. coalition forces. He was also aware, and did not disclose, that Innospec incorporated the
promised kickbacks into its promt
Innospec made payments totaling approximately $1,610,327 and promised an additional
$884,480 to MoO officials so as to garner good will with Iraqi authorities, obtain
additional orders under a Long Term Purchase Agreement that was executed in October
2004 (the â2004 LTPAâ) and ensure the execution of a second LTPA in January 2008

(the â2008 LTPAâ). Innospecâs total profit received from the conduct was $15,439,183.

A. Bribery of Iraqi Government Officials in Connection with the 2004
LTP.

31. Following the termination of the U.N. Oil for Food Program in late 2003,
Alcor entered into a three year Long Term Purchase Agreement for the sale of TEL to the
Iraqi MoO. The 2004 LTPA was executed in October 2004, and was performed pursuant
to six purchase orders dated February 2005 through December 2007. Under the contract,
Alcor sold a total of 5,932 Metric Tons (âMTâ) of TEL at a price of â¬10,500 per MT.
Innospecâs revenues from the contract were $82,340,489, and profits were $15,198,125.

32. With the approval of Innospecâs management, including Jennings,
Innospec continued to use Naaman, the agent used to make illicit payments under the Oil
for Food Program, to make improper payments to Iraqi officials to facilitate TEL
shipments under the 2004 LTPA. On October 10, 2005, Naaman sent an e-mail to

. Turner, copying Jennings, stating that prior to opening a letter of credit for a 740.MT

shipment of TEL, Iraqi officials were demanding a2% kickback from Alcor, which
equaled $195,912.78. Naamanâs e-mail to management further stated that: âWe are
sharing most of our profits with Iraqi officials. Otherwise, our business will stop and we

will lose the market. We have to change our strategy and do more compensation to get

the rewards.â
33. With Jenningsâ knowledge, Turner responded to Naamanâs e-mail.on
October 13, 2005, confirming that the requested kickback would be paid through an
additional 2% âcommissionâ to Naaman. On October 20, 2005, Tumer and Alcor
Manager discussed the wording of the invoice that Naaman would submit to Alcor to
support the kickback, with Tumer stating that âthe fewer words the better!â That same
day, Turner e-mailed Naaman the fictitious language that he wanted Naaman to include
in the invoice that he submitted to Alcor for the $195,912.78 payment. The payment was
approved with Jenningsâ knowledge.

34. In a similar e-mail dated February 5, 2006, Naaman informed Turner that
Iraqi officials were again demanding a 2% kickback in order to open a letter of credit for
an order of 2000 MT (later revised to 2200 MT) of TEL under the 2004 LTPA. In an e-
mail dated February 7, 2006, Jennings, while in the United States, approved the kickback
payment, and on February 10, 2006, Turner wrote Naaman to confirm that Alcor would
pay him an additional 2% âcommissionâ in connection with the order. In approximately
July 2006, Jennings approved an increase in Naamanâs commission on the 2004 LTPA

" from 3% to 5% with the understanding that some or all of the additional 2% would be
used by Naaman to pay off Iraqi officials on future LTPA orders.

35. ; On behalf of inniaspec and Alcor, Naaman paid an official at the Trade. Â°

Bank of Iraq in exchange for a favorable exchange rate on letters of credit for purchases
under the 2004 LTPA. Jennings was aware of the scheme.

36. âInall, from October 2005 to 2007, Innospec paid approximately
$1,369,269 in bribes to Iraqi officials, a significant portion funneled through Naaman, in

connection with the 2004 LTPA. The false commission invoices submitted by Naaman

10
with the knowledge of Jennings and senior officials at Innospec caused the bribe
payments to be improperly booked as legitimate commission payments on Innospecâs
books and records.

B. Bribery of Iraqi Government Officials to Ensure the Failure of a 2006
Trial Test of MMT and to Facilitate the Execution of a Second LTPA

with Iraq in 2008
37. In addition to the bribes to facilitate TEL orders on the 2004 LTPA,

Turner and others at Innospec directed and approved Naaman to pay a bribe of $155,000
in September 2006 and April 2007 to Iraqi officials, so that Innospec could ensure the
failure of a 2006 field trial test of MMT, a fuel product manufactured by a competitor of
Innospec and that competed with TEL. Naaman agreed to funnel the bribe payment on
Innospecâs behalf.

38. | Tumer and others at Innospec were concerned that if the MMT test was
successful it would cause Iraq to.purchase substantial amounts of MMT for its oil
refineries and lead to a corresponding decrease in demand for TEL in 2008. Accordingly,
on September 18, 2006, Turner approved a payment of $105,000 to Naaman, purportedly
âfor additional technical support and security operations required to nurture and protect
ongoing TEL business in Iraq.â

39. On February 28, 2007, Naaman sent Turner a letter enclosing the
confidential official MoO report for the MMT field trial test and noting his success in
making sure that the MMT test failed âagainst all odds.â Naaman also enclosed a
$50,000 invoice to Innospec, saying that he had been required to pay an extra $50,000 to
ensure that the MMT report came out in Innospecâs favor. The confidential report was

also shared with Jennings who was generally aware of the bribery of Iraqi officials.

11
40. On April 3, 2007, Innospec reimbursed Naaman for the additional $50,000
payment, which Turner approved. The two payments totaling $155,000 were improperly
booked as legitimate commission payments on Innospecâs books and records. Despite
the agreement between Turner and Naaman, Naaman retained some or all of the
$155,000 for himself.

41. Aside from agreeing to pay $155,000 up front to ensure that the MMT test
failed, Naaman, on Alcorâs behalf and with management authorization, also promised
additional bribes to Iraqi officials in connection with future TEL orders. In an e-mail
dated March 21, 2007, to Turner, Naaman described how he would use his 5%
commission from remaining shipments in 2007 and the new LTPA âto cover my promise
to these people for the loss of their remuneration from MMT, which is a very small price
we are paying versus the loss of my money and your money if MMT were admitted in.â
MMT was not admitted into Iraq. From in or around 2007 through February 2008,
Tumer and Naaman agreed to pay bribes to MoO officials to secure the 2008 LTPA with
Jenningsâ general knowledge that bribes were paid to Iraqi officials to obtain contracts.

42. In January 2008 Alcor executed a second LTPA with the MoO. In or
around late 2007 through early 2008, Naaman negotiated with a senior Iraqi MoO official
to pay bribes under the 2008: LTPA. The agreement took affect in June 2008 and on
February 24, 2009, the MoO opened a letter of credit in favor of Alcor for $17,000,000.
Had the agreement gone forward, 5% of the $17,000,000, i.e. $850,000, would
presumably have been shared with Iraqi officials via Naaman.

43. The agreement; however, did not go forward due to the investigation and

ultimate discovery of the widespread bribery in Iraq by United States regulators.

12
Innospec admitted that negotiations leading up to the agreement were tainted by bribery,
and as a result, the 2008 LTPA was not performed and Innospec did not pay Naaman any
commissions on the contract.

ke. Innospec Engaged in a Scheme to Pay Travel and Entertainment
Expenses for MoO Officials

44. Jennings was also generally aware of a scheme used by Innospec to incur
good will with the MoO and ensure that it continued to receive TEL orders. Turner and
others at Innospec directed and authorized payments, through Naaman, to fund lavish
trips for Iraqi officials in 2005 and 2006. For example, in June 2005, Turner arranged for
Neaman to pay $22,732 to cover the costs of a trip by eight Iraqi officials to Innospecâs
Ellesmere plant in the UK that included hotel accommodations, food and transportation
costs, as well as the provision of approximately $1,800 in âpocket moneyâ for each of
seven officials anid approximately $3,600 for the eighth official, who was head of the
Iraqi delegation. A similar trip with cash payments was taken in March 2006 to Dubai.
One trip in 2006 included a trip taken by a MoO official to Jordan and then Thailand for a
seven day honeymoon in exchange for the MoO officialâs assisting Innospec in a court
proceeding in the U.K. On instructions from Turner, Naaman falsified an invoice for
reimbursement of the cost of the trip to Thailand, to read â âpayment for airfares ee trip to ee
Amman [by the MoO official anid his wife] ie Bietasiaie disoussiowess.  Hinoapee s

payment covered hotel accommodations, food, and transportation costs within Thailand.â .

 

, On January 30, 2008, Naaman submitted an invoice to Alcor and Tumer for approval and
reimbursement of $34,480 for travel costs incurred by Iraqi MoO officials who traveled to Lebanon to
finalize the 2008 LTPA with Alcor. Due to the ongoing investigations being conducted by United States
regulators, Alcor never paid the invoice, which sought reimbursement for hotel accommodations, food,
mobile phone cards, three cameras and $15,000 in âpocket moneyâ for officials.

13
WW. JENNINGS ENGAGED IN BRIBERY OF INDONESIAN GOVERNMENT
OFFICIALS AT STATE OWNED OIL AND GAS COMPANIES

45. Aside from its illicit conduct in Iraq, Innospec also paid bribes to
Indonesian government officials from at least 2000 through 2005 in order to win
contracts for Innospec for the sale of TEL to state owned oil and gas companies in
Indonesia. Jennings became aware of and approved these payments beginning in mid to
late 2004. Innospec used various euphemisms to refer to the bribery scheme, including
âthe Indonesian Way,â âthe Lead Defense Fund,â and âTEL optimization.â The
euphemisms were commonly used in e-mails and in discussions with Jennings, Turner
and others at Innospec who were complicit in the bribery schemes.

46. From 2000 through 2005, the bribes were made through Indonesian Agent
and totaled approximately $2,883,507. Innospecâs revenues in connection with the illicit
bribes were approximately $48,571,937 and profits were $21,506,610. Bribery of
Indonesian officials continued until 2005, when Indonesia converted to unleaded fuel and
no longer needed TEL. Jennings knew about the ongoing bribery in Indonesia from mid

to late 2004.

A. Bribes to an Official at BP Migas in order to Generate
More TEL Sales

47. From 2000 until approximately 2005, Turner and senior officials at
Innospec were involved in a scheme to use Indonesian Agent and his company to pay
bribes of approximately $1,323,507 to Official X, who was the chairman of an
Indonesian state owned oil company called BP Migas. The scheme was outlined in an e-
mail dated January 8, 2001 from Managing Director to Turner stating that in 2000 and

2001 Innospec agreed to pay Official X $40 per MT for all TEL orders in excess of 4000

14
tons and $50 per MT for all TEL orders in excess of 5,000 tons. Jennings became aware
of the payments made to Official X in mid to late 2004 and 2005 in return for TEL
business. Innospec paid bribes of $161,950 to Official X in 2004 and $172,504 in 2005.

B. Bribes to a Government Official at Pertamina in Order to Sell 446.4
Metric Tons of TEL

48. In addition to the payments to Official X and other one-off payments,
Innospec bribed other Indonesian officials in order to influence their decisions regarding
TEL purchases. Prior to Jenningsâ knowledge of the bribery in Indonesia, Innospec was
paying bribes to Official Y at Pertamina. For instance, on December 18, 2003, an
employee of Indonesian Agent e-mailed Turner saying that Indonesian Agent had just
returned from a meeting with Official Y at Pertamina and that Official Y had said he
would help Octel, but he wanted moee-than just âcentsâ in return.

49. On May 14, 2004, the same employee e-mailed Tumer to say that
Indonesian Agent had been working hard to try and stop Indonesian officials from
switching to unleaded fuel in January 2005, and that Indonesian Agent âmight need some
extra money to support the Lead Defense activitiesâ in Indonesia.

50. In an e-mail dated August 16, 2004, to Jennings and Executive B, Turner
said that the entire Board of Pertamina had been replaced and-that âthe old position of
[Official Y was] no more.â âTurner âadded that Official Yâs role would be filled by
Official Z who was well known to Innospec and was being checked. In fall 2004, as head
of the TEL business unit, Jennings traveled to Indonesia with Tuer to meet Indonesian
Agent.

51. | Around November 2004, after Executive B had visited Indonesia,

Executive B met with Jennings to discuss Executive Bâs trip. Executive B told Jennings

15
that bribes had been paid by Innospec for years to get business in Indonesia and Iraq. In
December 2004, Jennings and Executive B discussed Innospecâs bribery scheme in Iraq
and Indonesia on a flight from Denver to New York. Executive B informed Jennings that
âthe bribery was a small cost to them, but was very beneficial; it was a small amount of
money for the government officials, but could have big importance to them. This is the
way it was always doneâ While Indonesian Agent was in the United States during the
holidays, various e-mails were sent to and from the United States that discussed Jenningsâ
and Turnerâs continued efforts to support Indonesian Agentâs payment of bribes on
Innospecâs behalf. Executive B also discussed the bribery scheme during Jenningsâ
performance review in January 2005.

52. In January 2005, Indonesian Agent secured an order on Innospecâs behalf
for 446.4 MT of TEL from Pertamina. In exchange, Innospec, through Turner, agreed to
a âone off paymentâ of $300,000 to Indonesian Agent with the understanding that it
would be passed on to Official Z.

53. The payment was arranged in two parts. First Innospec, with approval by
Jennings, increased Indonesian Agentâs commission on the order from 6% to 10%,
leading to an extra payment of $184,363.20, which was credited to the agentâs account in
Sinpapdre To cover the balance, Turner told Indonesian Agent to submit an invoiee for
$115,636.81 to Innospec, and provided the fictitious language that he wanted included in
the invoice to justify the payment.

54. | On February 8, 2005, Indonesian Agent e-mailed Turner saying that he
had opened an account for Official Z and that Official Z had called requesting his balance

payment. On February 14, 2005, Indonesian Agent submitted the $115,636.81 invoice to

16
Innospec, and Turner and Jennings approved it. On March 18, 2005, Innospec credited
the invoice payment to Indonesian Agentâs account in Singapore. The false invoices and
Turmerâs authorization of them caused Innospec to inaccurately record in its books and
records the entire $300,000 payment to Indonesian Agent as âsales commissions.â

55. In order to ensure that Official Z approved the 446.4 MT order, Turner
directed the payment of a trip taken by Official Z and his family to the UK in April 2005
with Jenningsâ knowledge.* Innospecâs revenues on the sale of 446.4 metric tons of TEL ~
to Pertamina were $4,796,155 and its profits were $1,898,571.

IV. JENNINGS SIGNS FALSE CERTIFICATIONS

56. From 2004 to February 2009, Jennings signed annual certifications that
were provided to auditors where he falsely stated that he complied with Innospecâs Code
of Ethics incorporating the companyâs Foreign Corrupt Practices Act policy, and that he
was unaware of any violations of the Code of Ethics by anyone else. During that time
frame, Jennings actively participated in bribery of Iraqi and Indonesian officials as
described above. Jennings also signed annual and quarterly personal certifications
pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 in which Jennings made false certifications
concerning the companyâs books and records and suteonal controls. Jennings also signed
false manasean es certifications to Inhospecâs auditors indicating that the books and

records were accurate and that Innospec had appropriate internal controls.

 

Â§ On January 6, 2005, Turner sent a fax to Indonesian agent with a copy to Jennings indicating that
âAs Paul and I both mentioned during our meeting in Jakarta, we will plan the visit to completely suit the
requirements of our friends from Pertamina.â The âfriendsâ referred to Official Z and another Pertamina
official. The fax further discussed the payment of the travel costs to the U.K. for the officials, and also
indicated that â[w]e will book accommodation at the most prestigious hotel in Chester and we can arrange
golf, shopping or whatever is required .... We look forward to reviewing the commercial details and future
supply arrangements for the year during the visit ....â
