VERAZ NETWORKS, INC.
Defendant.
Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (the âCommissionââ) alleges:
SUMMARY OF ACTION
1. This matter involves violations of the books and records and internal controls

provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (ââFCPAâ) by Veraz Networks, Inc. (âVerazâ or
âthe Companyâ), a San Jose, California-based telecommunications company. From 2007 to 2008,
Veraz resellers, consultants, and employees made and offered payments to employees of
government-controlled telecommunications companies in China and Vietnam with the purpose
and effect of improperly influencing these foreign officials to award or continue to do business

with Veraz. A Veraz supervisor referred to one of the payments as the âgift scheme.â

2. Veraz failed to accurately record these improper payments on the Companyâs
books and records, and failed to implement or maintain a system of effective internal accounting
controls to prevent them in violation of the FCPA which requires public companies to keep
books and records that accurately reflect their operations, and to put in place internal controls
that are reasonably designed to ensure that their books and records are accurate.

3. The Commission seeks an order permanently enjoining Veraz from violations of
the books and records and internal controls provisions of the FCPA, and requiring Veraz to pay a
civil monetary penalty.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 21(d) and 27 of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ) [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78u(d) and 78aa].
Defendant has, directly or indirectly, made use of the means and instrumentalities of interstate
commerce and of the mails in connection with the acts, transactions, practices and courses of
business alleged in this Complaint.

5. Venue in this District is proper pursuant to Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15
U.S.C. Â§ 78aa] because Defendant maintains its headquarters and transacts business within the
Northern District of California.

6. Intradistrict assignment to the San Jose Division is proper pursuant to Civil L.R.

3-2(c) because a substantial part of the events or omissions that give rise to this action occurred

in the County of Santa Clara.

direct sales force and indirect sales channels. The majority of the Companyâs revenue comes
from sales generated by offices outside the United States.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
A. Veraz Made Improper Payments to Chinese Government Officials.

8. Veraz engaged a consultant in China to assist Veraz. On behalf of Veraz, the
consultant sought to sell Veraz products to a telecommunications company controlled by the
government of China (âTelecommunications Company 1â).

9. In late 2007, Verazâs consultant in China provided approximately $4,500 worth of
gifts to officials at Telecommunications Company 1 in an attempt to secure a business deal for
Veraz. The consultant requested that his Veraz supervisor approve the funding for these gifts via
email. The supervisor approved what he described in an email as the âgift scheme.â

10. : In or around January 2008, the consultant also offered a separate improper
payment to officials at Telecommunications Company 1 to secure a deal for Veraz valued at
approximately $233,000. In an email among individuals involved in the transaction, the fee was
described as a âconsultant fee,â and was set at fifteen percent or approximately $35,000.
Telecommunications Company 1 awarded the contract to Veraz even though Verazâs bid was
higher than other bids. Veraz discovered this improper offer of payment prior to receiving any
money from the transaction and cancelled the sale.

11... Veraz did not make or keep books, records, and accounts which, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflected the improper gifts provided by Veraz to
Telecommunications Company 1. Veraz further failed to devise and maintain an effective
system of internal controls to prevent or detect violations of the FCPA.

B. Veraz Made Improper Payments to Vietnamese Government Officials.

12. In 2007 and 2008, Veraz sold products to a telecommunications company
controlled by the government of Vietnam (âTelecommunications Company 2â) through a
Singapore-based reseller. A Veraz employee, through the Singapore-based reseller, at times
made or offered illicit payments to the CEO of Telecommunications Company 2 in order to win

business for Veraz.

related to Telecommunications Company 2, including gifts and entertainment for
Telecommunications Company 2 employees and flowers for the wife of the CEO of
Telecommunications Company 2.

14. Veraz did not make or keep books, ronal and accounts which, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflected the improper payments provided by Veraz to
Telecommunications Company 2. Veraz further failed to devise and maintain an effective
system of internal controls to prevent or detect violations of the FCPA.
