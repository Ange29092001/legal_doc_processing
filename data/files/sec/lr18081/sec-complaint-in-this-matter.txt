UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK

 

UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE
COMMISSION

450 5th Street, N.W.

Washington, D.C. 20549,

Plaintiff,

JOSHUA C. CANTOR,

Defendant.

 

COMPLAINT

Plaintiff, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"âCommission"), for its Complaint alleges as follows:

SUMMARY

1. Defendant, Joshua C. Cantor ("Cantor"), the former president and director
of American Bank Note Holographics, Inc. ("ABNH"), participated in a
systematic, fraudulent scheme to inflate the revenues and net income of
ABNH and its publicly-held parent, American Banknote Corporation ("ABN"), in
order to meet earnings forecasts and to condition the market for an initial
public offering of stock by ABNH. The conduct took place over three years,
beginning with fiscal year 1996, and continuing through fiscal year 1998. To
avoid detection of the scheme, the defendant participated in actively
deceiving ABN's and ABNH's independent auditors.

A. False Filings and Impact on the Market For ABN and ABNH
Securities

2. On or about July 15, 1998, ABNH became a public company through an
initial public offering ("IPO") that raised approximately $107 million (pricing
shares at $8 % per share). ABN, which received the proceeds of the offering,
used most of the proceeds to reduce its debt. Filings by ABN and ABNH in
connection with the public offering, or relied upon in determining the price at
which ABNH shares would be offered and purchased, included materially
fraudulent revenue and earnings information.

3. In January 1999, ABNH announced that it would restate its results for each
of the first three quarters of fiscal year 1998, and that its annual financial
statements as of December 31, 1996, and December 31, 1997, should no
longer be relied upon. The prices of the securities of both ABNH and ABN
dropped substantially as a result of these announcements.

4. ABNH's restated results, reported in December 1999, had a material effect
on ABNH's reported annual revenue and net income and were material to
ABN's operating results. For example, in fiscal year 1996, ABNH improperly
recognized approximately $1.9 million of revenue, resulting in approximately
a $962,000, or 22%, overstatement of ABNH's net income, and a 31%
overstatement of ABN's net income. In fiscal year 1997, ABNH improperly
recognized approximately $7.8 million of revenue, resulting in approximately
a $4.7 million, or 167%, overstatement of ABNH's net income, and a 72%
understatement of ABN's net loss for that year.

5. In the second quarter of fiscal year 1998, ABNH improperly recognized
approximately $5.0 million of revenue, resulting in approximately a $1.9
million, or 498%, overstatement of ABNH's net income, and a 32%
understatement of ABN's net loss for that quarter. Finally, in the third quarter
of fiscal year 1998, ABNH improperly recognized approximately $5.5 million of
revenue, resulting in approximately a $2.5 million, or 843%, overstatement of
ABNH's net income for that quarter.

6. In part, as a result of the improper acts Cantor perpetrated, ABNH filed with
the Commission a Registration Statement on Form S-1 that contained
materially false and misleading financial statements and other information
pertaining to ABNH for fiscal years 1996 and 1997. Also, in part as a result of
Cantor's misconduct, ABNH's Registration Statement on Form S-1 contained
materially false and misleading financial statements and other information
pertaining to ABNH for the interim quarters for fiscal year 1997, and the first
quarter of fiscal year 1998, and ABNH's Forms 10-Q filed with the Commission
for the second and third quarters of fiscal year 1998 were materially false and
misleading.

7. (In part as a result of the improper acts Cantor perpetrated, ABN filed with
the Commission materially false and misleading financial statements on Form
10-K for fiscal years ended December 31, 1996 and December 31, 1997, and
filed with the Commission materially false and misleading financial
statements on Form 10-Q for the first three quarters of fiscal years ended
1997 and 1998.

8. As a result of the fraud Cantor participated in, ABN's and ABNH's outside
auditors and public investors were deceived into believing that ABN's net
income, and ABNH's revenue and net income, were materially better than
they were.

B. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act violations

9. In addition to the financial statement fraud described above, Cantor
violated the anti-bribery provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
("FCPA"). In late 1998 Cantor, in part, caused ABNH to make a $239,000
payment to a Swiss bank account for the purpose of influencing or affecting
the acts or decisions of one or more Saudi Arabian officials or the Saudi
Arabian government in order to assist ABNH in obtaining or retaining business
with the Saudi Arabian government.

C. Statutes and Rules Violated and Requested Relief

10. In this action, the Commission is seeking an order of permanent injunction
restraining and enjoining Cantor from:

11. directly or indirectly, violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933
(the "Securities Act") [15 U.S.C. Â§ 77q(a)], Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78j(b) and
78m(b)(5)], and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder [17 C.F.R. Â§Â§
240.10b-5, 240.13b2-1, and 240.13b2-2];

12. aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the
Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78m(a), 78m(b)(2)(A) and (B)], and Rules 12b-20,
13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder [17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 240.12b-20, 240.13a-1, and
240.13a-13]; and

13. violating Section 30A of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78dd-1(a)].

14. The Commission also is seeking, pursuant to Section 20(e) of the
Securities Act [15 U.S.C. Â§ 77t(e)] and Section 21(d)(2) of the Exchange Act
[15 U.S.C. Â§ 78u(d)(2)], an order barring Cantor from acting as an officer or
director of any issuer that has a class of securities registered pursuant to
Section 12 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78l], or that is required to file
reports pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§ 780], asa
result of his violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b)
of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

RISDICTION AND VENUE

15. The Commission brings this action pursuant to Section 20(b) of the
Securities Act [15 U.S.C. Â§ 77t(b)] and Sections 21(d) and 21(e) of the
Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78u(d) and 78u(e)] to restrain and enjoin
permanently Cantor from engaging in the acts, practices, and transactions
herein alleged.

16. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 22(a) of the
Securities Act [15 U.S.C. Â§ 77v(a)] and Sections 21(d), 21(e), and 27 of the
Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78u(d), 78u(e), and 78aa]. Venue lies in this Court
pursuant to Section 20 of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. Â§ 77t] and Section 27 of
the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78aal].

17. The defendant, directly and indirectly, has made use of the means and
instrumentalities of interstate commerce, of the mails, or of the means or
instrumentalities of transportation or communication in interstate commerce,
and/or the facilities of a national securities exchange, in connection with the
acts, practices and transactions alleged herein, certain of which occurred
within the Southern District of New York.

DEFENDANT

18. Joshua C. Cantor, age 43, is a resident of Westfield, New Jersey. He served
as president of ABNH from May 1997, until his resignation on February 4,
1999. From May 1998, until his resignation, Cantor also was an ABNH director.
From November 1995, until May 1997, Cantor was ABNH's executive vice
president and general manager. Cantor also served as an executive vice
president of ABN from September 1995, until his resignation.

OTHER PERSONS AND ENTITIES

19. ABN is a holding company incorporated in Delaware with its principal
offices located in New York, New York. During the relevant time period, ABN,
through its subsidiaries, provided, among other things, stored-value
telephone cards and magnetic-strip transaction cards, printed business forms,
checks, and counterfeit-resistant documents of value such as money orders,
passports, foreign currency, stock, and bond certificates. During the relevant
time period, ABN's stock was registered with the Commission pursuant to
Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and traded on the New York Stock
Exchange ("NYSE"). ABN filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on December 8,
1999 and emerged from United States bankruptcy protection as of October 1,
2002. ABN's common stock currently trades on the OTC Bulletin Board.

20. ABNH is a Delaware corporation with its principal executive offices located
in Elmsford, New York. ABNH is engaged in the origination, production, and
marketing of mass-produced secure holograms. Until July 1998, ABNH was a
wholly-owned subsidiary of ABN. On or about July 15, 1998, ABNH became a
public company having raised approximately $107 million through an S-1
Registration Statement filed with the Commission registering 13,636,000
shares of common stock for sale to the public. The proceeds of the offering
went entirely to ABN, most of which ABN used to reduce its debt. Thereafter,
ABNH's stock was registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act
and traded on the NYSE. In August 1999, ABNH's stock was suspended from
trading. ABNH's common stock currently trades on the OTC Bulletin Board.

FIRST CLAIM

Cantor Violated Sections 10(b)
and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 13b2-
2 Thereunder

21. Paragraphs 1 through 20 above are re-alleged and incorporated herein by
reference.

During the time that ABNH was a wholly-owned subsidiary of ABN, ABNH's
operations contributed materially to ABN's net income. To monitor ABNH's
financial performance, Cantor, with the assistance of a senior officer and
board member of ABNH and ABN (the "Senior Officer") and others, created
annual budgets that projected ABNH's revenue and earnings for a particular
fiscal year. The Senior Officer, among others, reviewed these financial
forecasts to determine whether ABNH would meet its projected revenue and
earnings for that quarter.

1. ABNH Improperly Recognized Revenue on Consignment and

"Bill and Hold" Sales and for Research and Development Work for
Fiscal 1996

22. ABNH's ability to meet or exceed its internal revenue and earnings budget
for fiscal year 1996 was critical to ABN's efforts to meet earnings forecasts
that fiscal year. As a result, in fiscal year 1996, with the Senior Officer's
knowledge and approval, Cantor caused ABNH to improperly recognize
revenue on consignment sales in order to inflate fiscal year 1996 revenue and
net income. In addition, in January 1997, the need to meet earnings forecasts
at ABN drove Cantor, among others, with the knowledge and approval of the
Senior Officer, to cause ABNH to enter into fraudulent "bill and hold" sales and
to improperly recognize revenue for research and development ("R&D") work.

A. ABNH Improperly Recognized Revenue on Consignment Sales

23. At the end of the third quarter of 1996, ABNH improperly recognized
revenue of $407,000 on a consignment sale to Colorado Plasticard, Inc., an
ABNH customer. In the fourth quarter of 1996, ABNH improperly recognized
revenue of approximately $238,000 on a consignment sale to Gemplus Corp.
USA ("Gemplus"), another ABNH customer. In each instance, Cantor, with the
knowledge and approval of the Senior Officer, arranged for ABNH to ship
holograms to these customers and for ABNH to bill them on a monthly basis
based upon the number of holograms each customer used during the month.
Despite the fact that the customers only agreed to purchase the holograms
they actually used, Cantor, with the Senior Officer's knowledge and approval,
caused ABNH to recognize revenue on the entire shipment of holograms to
each customer. Since the risks and rewards of ownership for the unused
holograms had not yet passed to the customers, recognizing revenue for all
the holograms upon shipment did not conform with generally accepted
accounting principles ("GAAP") and had the effect of fraudulently inflating
revenue and net income.

B. ABNH Improperly Recognized Revenue on "Bill and Hold" Sales

24. "Bill and hold" sales, by which a sale is made but the goods are retained
by the seller at the customer's request, may be recognized as revenue by the
seller before delivery to the buyer if certain stringent conditions set forth in
the Commission's Accounting Auditing and Enforcement Release ("AAER")
Number 108 are met. If these conditions are not met, the seller may not
recognize the sales as revenue until the goods are shipped to the customer.

25. In November and December 1996, Cantor, among others, learned that
ABNH would fall short of its revenue and earnings forecast for the fourth
quarter unless certain additional sales revenue was generated.
26. In mid to late January 1997, ABNH closed its books and sent preliminary
work papers to ABN's independent auditors, Deloitte & Touche LLP
("Deloitte"). Shortly thereafter, Cantor, and others, learned that ABNH failed
to meet its fourth quarter budget and forecasts for revenue. This shortfall, if
not reduced, would materially impact ABN's fiscal year 1996 net income. It
also would result in a reduction from ABN's target for earnings per share for
the fourth quarter of fiscal 1996 and the 1996 fiscal year.

27. In order to make it appear that ABN met its earnings per share goal for
the fourth quarter of fiscal year 1996 and for the 1996 fiscal year, Cantor,
among others, with the knowledge and approval of the Senior Officer, caused
ABNH, on or about January 30, 1997, to accrue revenue on two fraudulent "bill
and hold" sales for December 1996. One of the "sales" was to Colorado
Plasticard, in the amount of approximately $404,000, while the other was to
Gemplus, in the amount of approximately $231,000.

28. Accruing the revenue for 1996 for the two "bill and hold" transactions was
improper because Cantor knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that ABNH
and the customers had not entered into these sales on or before December
31, 1996. In addition, Cantor knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that the
two transactions did not meet the conditions set forth for recognizing revenue
for "bill and hold" sales under AAER Number 108. For example, ABNH, not the
customers, had requested that the transaction occur on a "bill and hold"
basis. Also, the holograms had not been segregated from ABNH's inventory
and identified as belonging to Colorado Plasticard and Gemplus as of
December 31, 1996. Finally, the alleged "bill and hold" sale to Colorado
Plasticard did not occur and ABNH reversed the sale in the first quarter of
fiscal year 1997.

C. ABNH Improperly Recognized Revenue for R&D Work

29. In order to make it appear that ABN met its earnings per share goal for
the fourth quarter of fiscal year 1996 and for the 1996 fiscal year, Cantor,
among others, with the knowledge and approval of the Senior Officer, also
caused ABNH, on or about January 31, 1997, to further inflate its fourth
quarter revenue and net income by fraudulently accruing revenue of
$800,000 for R&D work it had performed for Kokusai Medicom Corporation
("KMC"), a Japanese customer.

30. Throughout much of 1996, ABNH was working with KMC to develop secure
cards featuring holograms for use in connection with a pinball-type game
called Pachinko, which is played in parlors throughout Japan. On or about
January 30, 1997, ABNH accrued $800,000 in fraudulent revenue for the
Pachinko project for December 1996. However, as of December 31, 1996,
ABNH had not billed its customer for this amount and KMC did not have an
unconditional obligation to pay ABNH $800,000 as of December 31, 1996.
Cantor knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that payment of the $800,000
obligation was contingent, at a minimum, upon certain approvals being
obtained from government officials in Japan. The contingencies were not
satisfied as of December 31, 1996, and, in fact, never were satisfied.

D. ABN's Auditors Receive False Confirmations and a False
Management Representation Letter in Furtherance of the
Fraudulent Scheme

31. In the course of auditing ABN, a team of Deloitte auditors audited ABNH's
books. Cantor knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that the three fraudulent
transactions described above required confirmation to Deloitte and that this
required Colorado Plasticard, Gemplus, and KMC to sign false audit
confirmations.

32. To convince Deloitte that the two December 29, 1996 "bill and hold" sales
were proper, two audit confirmations were drafted on or about January 31,
1997, that falsely attested that the transactions had been entered into as of
December 29, 1996, and that the transactions met certain of the criteria set
forth in AAER Number 108. Cantor then induced the two customers involved
to sign these false confirmations, which Deloitte later received.

33. Cantor also secured a false audit confirmation letter from KMC which
Deloitte later received. In that confirmation, which was drafted on or about
January 31, 1997, KMC falsely attested that, as of December 29, 1996, the
amount of "$800,000 is due and payable by [KMC] to [ABNH]." Also, in March
1997, Cantor, along with another individual, created a written agreement
between KMC and ABNH falsely stating that, as of December 6, 1996, ABNH
was due a balance of $800,000 for development costs at such time as the
"pre-test phase" was completed. Cantor knew, or was reckless in not knowing,
that KMC's obligation to pay the $800,000 was contingent and that none of
the contingencies were met as of December 31, 1996.

2. ABNH Fraudulently Inflated Fiscal Year 1997
Revenue and Net Income in Anticipation of a Sale

A. ABNH Improperly Recognized Revenue on Consignment Sales
During the First Three Quarters of 1997

34. ABNH continued fraudulently to inflate its revenue and net income in fiscal
year 1997. During the first three quarters of fiscal 1997, Cantor, with the
Senior Officer's knowledge and approval, caused ABNH improperly to
recognize revenue of over $900,000 for consignment sales.

35. To keep track of its customers' payment obligations under consignment
sales, ABNH's accounting department, with Cantor's knowledge and approval,
used a separate set of books and records. Upon receiving usage reports from
its customers, ABNH issued invoices to bill them for that usage. Unlike the
false invoices issued at the time of the initial "sale" of the holograms, which
were not sent to the customers, these invoices reflected actual obligations of
the customers. ABNH tracked the "usage" invoices in ledgers that were kept
by hand.

B. ABNH Improperly Recognized Over $4 Million in Net Income
in the Fourth Quarter of 1997 to Position Itself for a Sale or an IPO

36. As fiscal year-end 1997 approached, ABN, which was highly leveraged at
the time, considered various approaches to reduce its debt, including a
possible sale of ABNH. In order to condition the market for this possible sale,
as well as to meet earnings forecasts, Cantor, with the Senior Officer's
knowledge, approval, and, in some instances, direct participation, caused
ABNH to inflate its fourth quarter revenue by over $8,000,000, or 260%, and
its fourth quarter net income by over $4,000,000, or 429%. In order to
accomplish this, ABNH recorded revenue on a number of transactions in the
fourth quarter, including additional improper consignment sales, shipments of
unusable work in process, and an improper "bill and hold" sale.

i. ABNH Shipped Work in Process and Improperly Recognized
Revenue on Additional Consignment Sales

37. Late in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 1997, Cantor, after consulting with
the Senior Officer, arranged for ABNH to ship unusable work in process to
Colorado Plasticard. The goods were shipped on or about December 31, 1997.
Cantor, with the Senior Officer's knowledge and approval, caused ABNH to
improperly recognize revenue of approximately $1.3 million on this shipment.
Cantor knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that the unusable work in
process would be returned to ABNH shortly after being shipped.

38. Also in the fourth quarter of 1997, Cantor, with the knowledge and
approval of the Senior Officer, caused ABNH to recognize revenue of
approximately $949,000 on improperly recorded consignment sales. These
improperly recorded consignment sales involved Colorado Plasticard,
Gemplus, and others.

ii. Improper Recognition of Approximately $6 Million in Revenue on
an $8 Million "Bill and Hold" Sale

39. In December 1997, Cantor arranged for MasterCard, one of ABNH's largest
customers, to place an $8 million "bill and hold" order. Cantor and the Senior
Officer then caused ABNH to recognize revenue of $6.9 million on the "bill and
hold" sale in fiscal year 1997. However, of the $6.9 million in revenue that
ABNH recognized in fiscal year 1997, approximately $6 million was fraudulent
because it should have been recognized in 1998. Cantor knew, or was
reckless in not knowing, that, although ABNH had a valid "bill and hold"
agreement in place with MasterCard, the transaction was improper because
ABNH recognized revenue from the sale of holograms that had not actually
been completed by December 31, 1997.

40. Cantor understood that in order for ABNH to recognize revenue in fiscal
year 1997 on the sale of holograms to MasterCard, all the holograms would
have to be completed, meaning that ABNH had to have at its facility, by
December 31, 1997, "reels" of numbered holograms labeled as belonging to
MasterCard. Cantor also understood that ABNH lacked the capacity to
manufacture such a large quantity of holograms by year-end 1997. In an
effort to manufacture and complete as many of the holograms as soon as
possible, Cantor, with the Senior Officer's knowledge and approval, arranged
for ABNH to subcontract the manufacturing of $6.9 million worth of holograms
to another company, Crown Roll Leaf, Inc. ("Crown Roll").

41. Cantor knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that Crown Roll could not
manufacture and complete all of the holograms by December 31, 1997. First,
Crown Roll did not have the capacity to manufacture all of the holograms by
year-end 1997. In fact, ABNH's agreement with Crown Roll called for a
production schedule that continued into mid-January 1998. Second, before
ABNH could recognize the sale of these holograms as a valid "bill and hold"
sale, the holograms had to be completed. This required the holograms, which
are initially produced in "rolls," (e.g., like a roll of paper towels), to be slit
down to smaller "reels," (like a roll of paper towels cut into thirds, for
example), and then numbered and separately labeled as belonging to
MasterCard. Cantor knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that Crown Roll was
engaged only to manufacture rolls because Crown Roll's facility lacked the
capacity to slit the rolls into reels and then number the holograms. Cantor,
therefore, knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that the holograms Crown
Roll produced would not be complete until they were delivered to ABNH's
facility and ABNH then slit, numbered, and labeled them as belonging to
MasterCard.

42. Crown Roll did not finish producing unslit, unnumbered rolls of holograms
until mid-January 1998. Cantor knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that
production had continued at Crown Roll into January 1998. Cantor also knew,
or was reckless in not knowing, that most of the rolls Crown Roll produced
were delivered to ABNH's manufacturing facility in January 1998. In addition,
Cantor knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that virtually all of the rolls
Crown Roll produced were slit and numbered at ABNH's facility in early 1998.
Nevertheless, Cantor, and the Senior Officer, caused ABNH to recognize
revenue, in fiscal year 1997, for all of the holograms Crown Roll
manufactured.

C. Cantor Misled Deloitte In Order To Hide The Improper Fiscal Year-
end 1997 MasterCard "Bill and Hold" Sale

43. Deloitte identified the $8 million "bill and hold" transaction as a major
issue for its audit of ABNH's results for fiscal year 1997. In connection with the
audit of this transaction, Cantor, and the Senior Officer, misled Deloitte into
believing that the holograms Crown Roll produced were completed, and were
delivered to ABNH's Huntington Valley facility, by December 31, 1997.

44. On a number of occasions, Cantor, the Senior Officer and those working at
their direction, told Deloitte that all of Crown Roll's holograms had been
completed and received at ABNH's facility by year-end 1997. In addition, at
Cantor's direction, and with the Senior Officer's knowledge and approval,
ABNH employees at the Huntington Valley facility backdated, and changed
quantities on, ABNH receiving documents. These receiving documents were
provided to Deloitte to convince it that ABNH had received all of Crown Roll's
holograms by December 31, 1997.

45. Cantor, at the Senior Officer's direction, caused changes to be made on
copies of Crown Roll's delivery receipts, altering dates and changing
quantities to make them consistent with the inaccurate ABNH receiving
documents. With Cantor's and the Senior Officer's knowledge and approval,
the falsified Crown Roll delivery receipts and the ABNH receiving documents
were provided to Deloitte. In addition, Cantor directed ABNH employees to
fabricate "vault receipts," which purported to show that the hologram "rolls"
ABNH had received had been slit into numbered "reels." Cantor and the
Senior Officer both reviewed the fraudulent ABNH "vault receipts" to insure
that they were consistent with the falsified copies of Crown Roll's delivery
receipts and ABNH's receiving documents. Cantor knew, or was reckless in not
knowing, that Deloitte was given the falsified "vault receipts."

46. Cantor, with the Senior Officer's knowledge and approval, also obtained a
false written confirmation from Beau Dietl & Associates ("BDA"), the security
firm hired to provide security at Crown Roll's facility. Cantor and the Senior
Officer did this in a further effort to convince Deloitte that holograms Crown
Roll manufactured had been completed and delivered to ABNH by December
31, 1997. The BDA confirmation, which was signed by Beau Dietl, falsely
stated that personnel from BDA had witnessed ABNH pick up "reels" of
holograms from Crown Roll and that all of the pickups were completed by
December 31, 1997. Cantor knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that BDA
provided this false written confirmation to Deloitte.

47. In March 1998, ABNH obtained a false written confirmation from Crown
Roll. The confirmation, which was provided to Deloitte, falsely confirmed that
Crown Roll manufactured "reels" of numbered holograms and that all of the
holograms required under the terms of the purchase order were
manufactured and picked up by ABNH, by December 31, 1997. Cantor knew,
or was reckless in not knowing, that this false confirmation was given to
Deloitte .

D. Deloitte Is Misled About Other Fiscal 1997 Transactions

48. In addition to the false and misleading oral and written statements made
in connection with confirming the MasterCard transaction, Cantor also
obtained two additional false audit confirmations that were provided to
Deloitte in an effort to conceal other fraudulent fiscal year 1997 sales. In one
instance, Cantor, with the Senior Officer's knowledge and approval, convinced
Colorado Plasticard to confirm an accounts receivable balance as of year-end
1997 that included the alleged sale of the unusable work in process that
Colorado Plasticard returned to ABNH in early January 1998. Cantor also
succeeded in persuading Gemplus to provide a confirmation to Deloitte that
misleadingly confirmed an incorrect balance receivable as of December 31,
1997. In fact, the confirmed balance receivable constituted the sales value of
a large quantity of holograms that were provided to Gemplus under a
consignment arrangement pursuant to which Gemplus was obligated to pay
only for those holograms it used.

49. ABNH employees never disclosed to Deloitte the "usage" invoices ABNH
sent to customers that had accepted holograms on consignment. Nor did they
disclose the ledgers in which these invoices were recorded.

50. Finally, Cantor, among others, also signed a management representation
letter, which was given to Deloitte in connection with Deloitte's review of
ABNH's fiscal year 1997 financial statements that they knew, or were reckless
in not knowing, was false and misleading. Among other things, the letter
falsely stated that: (1) "[t]here has been no fraud involving management or
employees who have significant roles in internal controls;" (2) "[t]here are no
transactions that have been improperly recorded in the accounting records
underlying the financial statements;" (3) "[wle have fully disclosed to you all
sales terms including all rights of return...;" and (4) "receivables at
December 31, 1997... do not include any amounts for goods shipped on
consignment or approval." The management representation letter also falsely
confirmed that the "bill and hold" sales that occurred during fiscal year-end
1996, as well as the MasterCard "bill and hold" sale, which occurred in the
fourth quarter of 1997, accorded with certain criteria outlined under AAER
Number 108.

3. ABNH's Fraudulent 1998 Transactions

51. The need to report strong revenue and net income was critical in fiscal
year 1998 because ABN decided to sell ABNH through an IPO. Reporting
sustained revenue and earnings growth at ABNH during the first quarter of
fiscal year 1998, the reporting period leading up to the IPO, would enhance
ABNH's spin-off value. This, in turn, would redound to the benefit of ABN,
which was to take all the proceeds from the transaction. Also, reporting strong
revenue and earnings during the second quarter of fiscal year 1998, would
solidify investor confidence in ABNH as a public company.

A. First Quarter of 1998: Improper Revenue Recognition on
Consignment Sales, Recognizing Revenue on Product that was
Never Shipped, and Recognizing Revenue on Product that was
Returned

52. Cantor, with the Senior Officer's knowledge and approval, caused ABNH in
the first quarter of fiscal 1998 to improperly recognize revenue of
approximately $1.9 million on consignment sales with various customers. In
addition, Cantor, with the Senior Officer's knowledge and approval, further
inflated ABNH's revenue and net income in the first quarter of fiscal 1998 by
approximately $1.6 million by recognizing revenue on alleged sales to
customers who never received any goods and, at times, recognizing revenue
on shipments of holograms that Cantor knew, or was reckless in not knowing,
would be returned.

B. The Second and Third Quarters of 1998: Improper Revenue
Recognition on Consignment Sales and on Shipments to Warehouses,
Recognizing Revenue on Product that was Never Shipped, and
Recognizing Revenue on Product that was Returned

53. ABNH's IPO occurred on or about July 15, 1998. Its first filings as a public
company were made on Form 10-Q for the second and third quarters of fiscal
1998. During this period, Cantor, with the Senior Officer's knowledge and
approval, caused ABNH fraudulently to recognize approximately $1,397,000
in revenue for improperly recorded consignment sales during these two
quarters.

54. Improper recognition of revenue on consignment sales was insufficient to
achieve both internal and analyst revenue and earnings projections for ABNH
in the second and third quarters of fiscal year 1998. In order to meet these
expectations, Cantor, with the Senior Officer's knowledge and approval,
caused ABNH to effect a warehousing arrangement with Brinks in June 1998,
just weeks before ABNH's IPO. ABNH then began to ship large quantities of
holograms to a Brinks warehouse, as well as occasional shipments to other
warehouses.

55. Cantor, with the Senior Officer's knowledge and approval, caused ABNH
improperly to recognize revenue on all the shipments to the warehouses in
the second and third quarters of fiscal 1998, some of which involved
consignment sales. In addition, some of the shipments to the Brinks
warehouse were outright false sales. In these instances, without a customer
purchase order, and without the customer's knowledge, authorization or
approval, Cantor, with the Senior Officer's knowledge and approval, caused
ABNH to recognize revenue after shipping holograms to the Brinks warehouse
where they sat for months. These practices involved approximately eleven
customers and, on an unrestated basis, amounted to fraudulently recognized
revenue of over $5.8 million during the second and third quarters of fiscal
1998.

56. During the second and third quarters of 1998, separate and apart from
the products placed in the third party warehouses, Cantor, with the Senior
Officer's knowledge and approval, continued to cause ABNH to recognize
revenue in instances where the customer never issued purchase orders. In
these cases, ABNH either never shipped the holograms to these customers or
shipped holograms that were returned shortly after being shipped. In total,
these practices involved seven customers and, on an unrestated basis,
amounted to fraudulently recognized revenue of more than $5 million.

C. Fourth Quarter of 1998: Improper Recording of Revenue on
Consignment Sales, on Shipments to Warehouses, on Product that
was Never Shipped, on Product that was Returned, and on the
Shipment of Test Material

57. As ABNH approached its first year-end as a public company, Cantor knew,
or was reckless in not knowing, that ABNH was going to fall short of its
revenue and earnings budget. To make up for this shortfall, Cantor, with the
Senior Officer's knowledge and approval, caused ABNH to record improperly,
on an unrestated basis, over $11.3 million in revenue on its books and records
for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 1998.

58. This amount included, among other things, improperly recorded
consignment sales, improperly recorded revenue on shipments to third-party
warehouses, and the recording of revenue on product that was never shipped,
product that was returned, and on the shipment of test material. In one
instance, Cantor, with the Senior Officer's knowledge and approval, caused
ABNH to improperly record almost $4 million in revenue for a shipment to
Colorado Plasticard of scrap material and empty boxes. The Senior Officer
also directed Cantor to ship test material to another customer without a
purchase order. Cantor, with the Senior Officer's knowledge and approval,
then caused ABNH to improperly record revenue of nearly $2 million on the
shipment.

59. Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§78j(b)] and Rule 10b-5
thereunder [17 C.F.R. Â§ 240.10b-5] prohibit, inter alia, any device, scheme or
artifice to defraud in connection with the purchase or sale of securities, or the
making of any untrue statement of a material fact or omitting to state a
material fact, in connection with the purchase or sale of any security. Section
13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§78m(b)(5)] and Rules 13b2-1 and
13b2-2 thereunder [17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 240.13b2-1 and 240.13b2-2] prohibit, inter
alia, circumvention of internal accounting controls, falsification of corporate
books and records and material misstatements or omissions by officers or
directors to an accountant in connection with an audit or a filing with the
Commission.

60. By virtue of the conduct described in paragraphs 21 through 58 herein,
Cantor violated Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules
10b-5, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder.

SECOND CLAIM
Cantor Violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act

61. Paragraphs 1 through 60 above are re-alleged and incorporated herein by
reference.

62. On or about July 15, 1998, ABNH became a public company through an
IPO that raised approximately $107 million. ABN, which sold all of its shares in
the offering, received all of the proceeds of the offering and used most of
them to pay down its debt. The ABNH public offering took place pursuant to a
Registration Statement ABNH filed on Form S-1 with the Commission, which
included financial statements for ABNH for the fiscal years ended December
31, 1996 and December 31,1997, as well as the interim quarters for fiscal
year 1997 and the first quarter of fiscal year ended December 31, 1998.

63. Cantor signed ABNH's Registration Statement on Form S-1.

64. Cantor knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that the financial statements
included in the Registration Statement on Form S-1 and disseminated to
investors in conjunction with that offering were materially false and
misleading.

65. Section 17(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. Â§ 77q(a)] provides that it is
unlawful in the offer or sale of any security to employ any device, scheme or
artifice to defraud, to obtain money by means of any materially untrue
statement or material omission or to engage in any transaction, practice of
course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon
the purchaser of a security.

66. By virtue of the conduct described in paragraphs 21 through 64 herein,
Cantor violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act.

THIRD CLAIM

Aiding and Abetting violations of Sections 13(a)
and 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the Exchange Act and
Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 Thereunder, Against Cantor

67. Paragraphs 1 through 66 above are re-alleged and incorporated herein by
reference.

68. ABN filed with the Commission annual reports on Form 10-K for its fiscal
years 1996 and 1997, and filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the first
three quarters of fiscal years 1997 and 1998. ABNH filed with the Commission
quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the second and third quarters of its fiscal
year ended December 31, 1998. ABNH also filed with the Commission a
Registration Statement on Form S-1 in connection with its IPO that contained
financial statements and other information pertaining to ABNH for its fiscal
years 1996 and 1997, and quarterly financial results for fiscal year 1997 and
the first quarter of fiscal year 1998. As a result, in part, of the improper acts
Cantor perpetrated as alleged in this Complaint, the financial statements in all
of these filings were materially false and misleading because ABNH's revenue
and net income had been fraudulently inflated.

69. From 1996 through 1998, ABN had securities registered with the
Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§
78I(b)]. As of on or about July 15, 1998, ABNH had securities registered with
the Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§
781(b). As a result, ABN and ABNH were required under Sections 13(a) and
13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78m(a) and 78m(b)(2)
(A) and (B)] and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 [17 C.F.R. Â§Â§
240.12b-20, 240.13a-1 and 240.13a-13] to file quarterly, annual and other
reports and statements with the Commission which did not contain untrue
statements of material facts or omissions of material facts and to make and
keep books, records, and accounts, which, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflected the transactions and dispositions of ABN and ABNH assets.
ABN and ABNH also were required to devise and maintain a system of internal
accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that
transactions were recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP or any other criteria applicable to such
statements.

70. As a result, in part, of Cantor's participation in the fraudulent scheme,
ABN, in fiscal years 1996, 1997, and 1998, and ABNH, in fiscal year 1998,
maintained materially false and misleading books and records which, among
other things, materially overstated ABNH's revenue and net income during
those fiscal years. Among other things, ABNH failed properly to account for
consignment sales and "bill and hold" sales. Moreover, ABNH's books, records,
and accounts documented a number of transactions that did not take place.

71. By reason of the foregoing, ABN and ABNH violated Sections 13(a) and
13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20 and
13a-13, and ABN violated Exchange Act Rule 13a-1.

72. Cantor knowingly provided substantial assistance to ABN and ABNH in
connection with the companies' violations of the aforesaid provisions.

73. By virtue of the conduct described at paragraphs 21 through 72 herein,
and pursuant to Section 20(f) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78t(f)], Cantor
is liable as an aider and abettor of ABN's and ABNH's violations described in
paragraph 71Lherein.

FOURTH CLAIM
Cantor Violated the FCPA

74. Paragraphs 1 through 73 are re-alleged and incorporated herein by
reference.

75. In 1998, ABNH employed agents who were responsible for seeking out
new business in various regions of the world. These agents were generally
compensated on a commission basis for any business they generated for the
company.

76. In late 1998, one of ABNH's agents, informed an ABNH employee of an
opportunity to bid on a contract to produce holograms for the government of
Saudi Arabia. In an effort to win the contract, Cantor, with the authorization of
the Senior Officer and at his direction, authorized and directed an ABNH
employee to wire $239,000 to a Swiss bank account for the benefit of one or
more officials of the Saudi Arabian government.

77. The employee wired the money as instructed and ABNH accounted for this
payment as a consulting fee. This $239,000 payment comprised nearly 40%
of the contract's value. Cantor, and the Senior Officer, caused ABNH to make
the payment for the purpose of influencing or affecting the acts or decisions
of one or more Saudi Arabian officials, or the Saudi Arabian government, in
order to assist ABNH in obtaining or retaining business with the Saudi Arabian
government.

78. Section 30A (a) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78dd-1(a)], the anti-
bribery provision of the FCPA, prohibits, in part, any issuer which has a class
of securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act or any
officer, director, employee, or agent of such issuer, from making use of the
mails or any means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce corruptly in
furtherance of an offer, payment, promise to pay, or authorization of the
payment of any money, or offer, gift, promise to give, or authorization of the
giving of anything of value to (1) any foreign official for purposes of (A)(i)
influencing any act or decision of such foreign official in his official capacity,
or (ii) inducing such foreign official to do or omit to do any act in violations of
the lawful duty of such official, or (iii) securing any improper advantage, or;
(B) inducing such foreign official to use his influence with a foreign
government or instrumentality thereof to affect or influence any act or
decision of such government or instrumentality, in order to assist such issuer
in obtaining or retaining business for or with, or_directing business to, any
person.
79. By reason of the foregoing, Cantor violated Section 30A of the Exchange
Act [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78dd-1].
