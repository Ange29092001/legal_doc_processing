UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA

 

U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, :
100 F Street, NE :

Washington, D.C. 20549 Case: 1:11-cv-00563

Assigned To : Leon, Richard J.

eae Assign. Date : 3/18/2011
7 "Description: General Civil
INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES : COMPLAINT
CORPORATION :
Defendant.

 

Plaintiff, Securities and Exchange Commission (âCommissionâ), alleges:
SUMMARY

I. During the period from 1998 through 2009, in violation of the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act of 1977 (âFCPAâ), employees of certain of International Business Machines
Corporationâs (âIBMâ or the âCompanyâ) subsidiaries and a majority-owned joint venture
provided cash payments, improper gifts, as well as improper travel and entertainment to
government officials in South Korea and China.

2. From 1998 to 2003, employees of IBM Korea, Inc. (âIBM-Koreaâ), an IBM
subsidiary, and LG IBM PC Co., Ltd. (âLG-IBMâ), a joint venture in which IBM held a majonity
interest, made payments to various government officials in South Korea. The purpose of these
payments was to secure the sale of IBM products through IBM-Korea and LG-IBMâs business
partners. During the relevant period, these managers paid approximately KRW 216,832,500
(South Korean Won), or $207,000, in cash bribes to South KorÃ©an government officials,

including providing improper gifts and payments of travel and entertainment expenses.
3: From at least 2004 to early 2009, employees of IBM (China) Investment
Company Limited and IBM Global Services (China) Co., Ltd. (collectively, âIBM-Chinaâ), both
wholly-owned IBM subsidiaries, engaged in a widespread practice of providing overseas trips,
entertainment, and improper gifts to Chinese government officials. The misconduct in China
involved several key IBM-China employees and more than 100 IBM China employees overall.

4. Despite its extensive international operations, IBM lacked sufficient internal
controls designed to prevent or detect these violations of the FCPA. During the period 1998 to
2009, IBM had corporate policies prohibiting bribery and procedures relating to compliance with
the FCPA; however, deficient internal controls allowed employees of IBMâs subsidiaries and
joint venture to use local business partners and travel agencies as conduits for bribes or other
improper payments to South Korean and Chinese government officials over long periods of time.

5. During the period 1998 to 2009, IBM failed to make and keep books and records
that accurately reflected the improper payments made in South Korea and China. Instead, these
payments were recorded as legitimate business expenses.

6. By its conduct, defendant IBM violated Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of
the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78m(b)(2)(A) and 78m(b)(2)(B)] by failing to maintain an
adequate internal control system to detect and prevent improper payments and by improperly
recording these payments in its books and records. Unless restrained and enjoined by the Court,
defendant IBM will continue to engage in acts and practices that constitute, or will constitute,
violations of these provisions.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE
7. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 21(d), 21(e) and

27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78u(d), 78u(e) and 78aaJ.
8. Venue in the District of Columbia is proper pursuant to Section 27 of the
Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78aa]}.

9. In connection with the conduct described herein, IBM, directly or indirectly, made
use of the mails or the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce in connection with the
acts, transactions, practices and courses of business alleged in this Complaint.

FACTS
A. Payments To Government Officials Of South Korea
14. From 1998 through 2002, IBM-Korea and LG-IBM employees made improper

cash payments to South Korean government officials. IBM-Korea and LG-IBM employees paid
a total of approximately $135,558 and $71,599 in cash bribes, respectively. LG-IBM also
provided free personal computers to, and paid for the entertainment expenses of, these officials.
The foreign government officials involved worked for sixteen South Korean government entities
(âSKGEâ).
IBM-Korea Paid Bribes To Government Officials Of SKGE 1

15. In mid-December 1998, IBM-Koreaâs Territory Manager for the Public Sector
(âTerritory Managerâ) met the Chief of Operations for the Electronic Operations Division of
SKGE 1 (âSKGE 1 Operations Chiefâ) and gave him a shopping bag containing a large IBM-
Korea envelope filled with KRW 20 million ($19,093). The Territory Manager paid similar
bribes to the SKGE 1 Operations Chief at the same time and location between 1999 and 2001. In
total, the Territory Manager made payments totaling KRW 80 million ($76,372) to the SKGE 1
Operations Chief in exchange for designating IBM-Korea a preferred supplier of mainframe
computers to SKGE 1 and for placing orders with IBM-Korea at higher prices.

16. | IBM-Koreaâs Cluster Manager for the Public Sector (âCluster Managerâ) also
paid several bribes to an employee of SKGE 1 (âSKGE 1 Officialâ). Between December 2000
and September 2002, the Cluster Manager delivered a total of KRW 22 million ($21,000) in cash
to the SKGE 1 Official, who was responsible for purchasing mainframe computers for SKGE 1.
Each time, the Cluster Manager placed the cash in large IBM-Korea envelopes and handed them
to the SKGE 1 Official at parking lots near the latterâs office and apartment complex. These
cash payments were made in exchange for (1) maintaining IBM-Korea as the supplier of
mainframe computers to SKGE 1; and (2) for helping an IBM-Korea business partner win bids to
supply mainframe computers and storage equipment to SKGE 1 worth more than KRW 22

billion ($21 million).
IBM-Korea Paid Bribes To A Government Official Of SKGE 2

17. In 2002, the IBM-Korea Cluster Manager made two payments totaling KRW 40
million ($38,186) to a manager of the government-controlled SKGE 2. In each case, the Cluster
Manager handed a shopping bag containing KRW 20 million ($19,093) in cash to SKGE 2âs
Manager of Information Business (âSKGE 2 Managerâ) first at a parking lot of a Japanese
restaurant and then later at a parking lot behind the SKGE 2 Managerâs apartment. The payment
was made in exchange for the SKGE 2 Managerâs assistance to IBM-Korea in obtaining a
contract with SKGE 2 worth approximately KRW 13.7 billion ($13 million) for the installation
of a mainframe computer in 2002.

LG-IBM Paid A Bribe And Gave Improper Gifts To Government Officials Of SKGE 3

18. In September 2000, LG-IBM sold 1,596 personal computers to SKGE 3 for
approximately KRW 1.4 billion ($1.3 million). LG-IBM was required at the time to participate
in a benchmarking test to qualify for SKGE 3âs personal computer supply contract. During the
test, certain problems were detected in LG-IBMâs computers. Because of these problems, LG-
IBMâs Manager of Special Sales (âSpecial Sales Managerâ) contacted SKGE 3âs Director of
Planning (âSKGE 3 Officialâ) to ask for help in winning SKGE 3âs personal computer supply
contract. LG-IBM later won the contract.

19. The Special Sales Manager directed one of LG-IBMâs business partners to
âexpress his gratitudeâ to the SKGE 3 Official by providing KRW 15 million ($14,320) to the
SKGE 3 Official. In turn, the LG-IBM business partner was âadequately compensated by
generous installation feesâ paid by LG-IBM. This transaction was not accurately recorded in
LG-IBMâs books and records.

20. LG-IBM also provided free notebook computers to SKGE 3 employees to entice

them to purchase IBM products.
LG-IBM Paid A Bribe To A Government Official Of SKGE 4

21. | SKGE 4 was a state-owned agency of the South Korean government. In late
October or early November 2001, an employee of LG-IBMâs Public Sector Sales (âPublic Sector
Sales Employeeâ) made an improper payment of KRW 10 million ($9,546) to an employee of
SKGE 4 responsible for reviewing personal computer procurement bids (âSKGE 4 Managerâ).
The purpose of the bribe was to win a contract to supply 657 (later increased to 825) personal
computers valued at KRW 1,448,700,000 ($1,383,007).

22. At the time, SKGE 4 was soliciting bids to supply personal computers to the
agency. The Public Sector Sales Employee contacted the SKGE 4 Manager to ask for SKGE 4âs
internal target price. The SKGE 4 Manager declined to provide that information but told the
Public Sector Sales Employee, âYou have to win the contract, then I can bey you.â The Public
Sector Sales Employee understood this statement to mean that he should submit a low bid and
the SKGE 4 Manager would help him make up the difference between LG-IBMâs bid and SKGE
4âs internal target price after LG-IBM won the contract.

23. After LG-IBM won the contract, the SKGE 4 Manager took the Public Sector
Sales Employee to the SKGE 4 Managerâs office where they replaced LG-IBMâs winning bid
sheet with a new bid sheet. The new bid sheet showed a price that was KRW 30 million
($28,640) higher than LG-IBMâs original bid. The new, higher price was closer to SKGE 4âs
internal target price.

24. The Public Sector Sales Employee then contacted LG-IBMâs business partner
who was to install the computers and directed the companyâs president to make a payment to the
SKGE 4 Manager. The LG-IBM business partner overbilled LG-IBM for the installation cost

and used the extra money to pay the SKGE 4 Manager. On or about December 29, 2001, the
president of LG-IBMâs business partner caused approximately KRW 15 million ($14,320) in
cash to be delivered to the SKGE 4 Manager.

25. In February 2002, after the installation was completed, LG-IBM made two
separate payments to the LG-IBM business partner. The first payment was KRW 24,600,000
($23,485), which was designated as a payment for installation services. The second payment of
KRW 15,330,000 ($14,635) was the reimbursement for the payment to the SKGE 4 Manager.

LG-IBM Paid A Bribe To A Government Official Of SKGE 5
And Improperly Paid For Entertainment Expenses

26. In August 2002, LG-IBMâs manager of Direct Sales (âDirect Sales Managerâ)
and Special Sales Manager provided dinner and entertainment to a South Korean government
official, who was the Director of SKGE 5âs information technology department (âSKGE 5
Officialâ) and responsible for procurement decisions, and his subordinate. After the meal and a
few drinks, the Special Sales Manager gave KRW 20 million ($19,093) cash to the SKGE 5
Official. The Special Sales Manager later told the Direct Sales Manager, âI have done my part.â
The payment of KRW 20 million ($19,093) was made to the SKGE 5 Official in exchange for
providing LG-IBM with certain confidential information regarding the product specifications on
SKGE 5âs request for procurement. The funds used to bribe the SKGE 5 Official was provided
by LG-IBMâs business partner, a company that received an overpayment from LG-IBM for
installation services. LG-IBM entered into a contract with SKGE 5 to supply 1,790 personal
computers and 1,790 Local Area Network (LAN) cards for a total contract price of
approximately KRW 1.74 billion ($1.7 million).

LG-IBM Provided Gifts And Improperly Paid For Travel And Entertainment Expenses
For Government Officials Of SKGE 6

27. In 2001, LG-IBM sold 1,550 personal computers and other equipment to SKGE 6

for a contract value of KRW 16 billion ($15.3 million). KRW 40 million ($38,186) was paid to

7
an LG-IBM business partner for software services, even though the LG-IBM business partner did
not provide any software services. Instead, the LG-IBM business partner returned KRW 34
million ($32,458) to the LG-IBM Direct Sales Manager and the funds were deposited in his own
personal bank account and used to fund improper gifts for, and entertainment of, government
officials. The LG-IBM business partner retained the difference of KRW 6 million ($5,728).

28. During the period 2001 through 2003, the Direct Sales Manager entertained and
provided gifts to employees of SKGE 6. These included payments to the bank account of a
âhostess in a drink shop,â as well as on travel and entertainment expenses for employees of
SKGE 6. The purpose of these improper payments was to persuade employees of SKGE 6 to
purchase IBM products.

29. The Direct Sales Manager also generated money for entertainment expenses by
selling laptop computers that were billed to the government customer. The value of the laptop
computers was added to orders placed by SKGE 6, and the transactions recorded as if the laptops
were provided to the customer.

30. | LG-IBM also provided free computers to certain key decision makers at SKGE 6
to entice them to purchase IBM products.

LG-IBM Gave Improper Gifts To Officials Of Other South Korean Government Entities

31. | LG-IBM also provided free computers and computer equipment to key decision
makers at ten other SKGEs to entice them to purchase IBM products or to provide information to
assist LG-IBM in the bidding process.

B. Payments to Government Officials Of China

32. From at least 2004 to earlyâ 2009, IBM-China employees created slush funds at

local travel agencies in China that were then used to pay for overseas and other travel expenses

incurred by Chinese government officials. In addition, IBM-China employees created slush
funds at its business partners to provide a cash payment and improper gifts, such as cameras and
laptop computers, to Chinese government officials. IBM failed to record accurately these
payments in its books and records.

IBM-China Employees Created Slush Funds To Pay For Travel And Entertainment Expenses
* Of Chinese Government Officials

33. As part of its business, IBM-China entered into contractual agreements with its
government-owned or controlled customers in China for hardware, software, and other services.
These contracts contained provisions requiring IBM-China to provide training to the employees
of these customers given the high-tech nature of IBMâs products and services. In some cases,
IBM held this training offsite and required the customers to travel. In advance of any training
trips, IBM-China employees were required to submit a Delegation Trip Request (âDTRâ)
detailing the business purpose of the trip, all planned sightseeing or entertainment activities, and
anticipated expenses. The DTRs required approval by IBM-China managers. IBM-Chinaâs
policies required customers to pay for side-trips and stopovers unrelated to the training.

34. Between 2004 and 2009, IBMâs internal controls failed to detect at least 114
instances in which (1) IBM-China employees and its local travel agency worked together to
create fake invoices to match approved DTRs; (2) trips were not connected to any DTRs; (3)
trips involved unapproved sightseeing itineraries for Chinese government employees; (4) trips
had little or no business content; (5) trips involved one or more deviations from the approved
DTR; and (6) trips where per diem payments and gifts were provided to Chinese government
officials. Moreover, IBM-China personnel also used its official travel agency in China to funnel
money that was approved for legitimate business trips to fund unapproved trips. IBM-China
personnel utilized the companyâs procurement process to designate its preferred travel agents as

âauthorized training providers.â IBM-China personnel then submitted fraudulent purchase
requests for âtraining servicesâ from these âauthorized training providersâ and caused IBM-
China to pay these vendors. The money paid to these vendors was used to pay for unapproved
trips by Chinese government employees.

35. | The misconduct in China involved two key IBM-China managers, who planned
customer trips, and more than 100 IBM-China employees.
