U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
Litigation Release No. 22672 / April 16, 2013

Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release No. 3454 / April 16,
2013

Securities and Exchange Commission v. Parker Drilling Company,
Civil Action No. 1:13CV461 (E.D. Va., April 16, 2013)

SEC Charges Parker Drilling Company with Violating the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act

The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Parker Drilling
Company, a worldwide drilling services and project management firm, with
violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by authorizing improper
payments to a third-party intermediary retained to assist the company in
resolving customs disputes.

The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Alexandria, Virginia,
alleges that in 2004 Parker Drilling authorized payments to a Nigerian agent
totaling $1.25 million. The company did so despite former senior executives
knowing that the agent intended to use the funds to "entertain" Nigerian
officials involved in resolving Parker Drilling's ongoing customs problems.
Following the Nigerian agent's work, the company received an unexplained
$3,050,000 reduction of a previously assessed customs fine, and the
company was permitted to nationalize and sell its Nigerian rigs.

To settle the SEC's charges, Parker Drilling will pay disgorgement of
$3,050,000 plus pre-judgment interest of $1,040,818. Parker Drilling
consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from
violating Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act. The
proposed settlement is subject to court approval.

In the parallel criminal proceedings, the Department of Justice entered into a
Deferred Prosecution Agreement with Parker Drilling in which the company
will pay an $11,760,000 penalty.

The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the Department of Justice's Fraud
Section, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the United Kingdom's Crown
Prosecution Service and Metropolitan Police Service.
