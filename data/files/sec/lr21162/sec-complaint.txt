NATUREâS SUNSHINE PRODUCTS, INC., a Utah Civil No. 2:09CV0672
Corporation, DOUGLAS FAGGIOLI, and CRAIG
D. HUFF,
Judge: Bruce S. Jenkins
Defendants.

 

Plaintiff, Securities and Exchange Commission (the âCommissionââ), for its Complaint
against Defendants alleges as follows:
INTRODUCTION
1. This matter involves payments made by Natureâs Sunshine Product Inc.âs (âNSPââ)
wholly-owned subsidiary in Brazil to customs agents to import certain unregistered NSP
products into Brazil during 2000 and 2001.
2. NSP is a manufacturer of nutritional and personal care products which markets its
products worldwide through a system of independent multi-level marketing distributors.
3. In or about 1994, NSP established a wholly-owned subsidiary in Brazil, a country which

soon became NSPâs largest foreign market.
Case 2:09-cv-00672-BSJ Documenta Filed 07/31/2009 Page 2ofi5

10.

In or about 1999 and 2000, the Brazilian government reclassified certain vitamins, herbal
products, and nutritional supplements being sold in Brazil as medicines, including certain
products being sold at that time by NSPâs Brazilian subsidiary. The re-classification
required NSPâs Brazilian subsidiary to register many NSP products it sold in Brazil as
medicines.
NSPâs Brazilian subsidiary was unable to register some of these products, and as a
consequence, sales for NSPâs Brazilian subsidiary dramatically declined
In an effort to circumvent the new registration requirements for the importation and sale
of certain NSP products, NSPâs subsidiary in Brazil made undocumented cash payments
to Brazilian customs brokers, some of which were later paid to Brazilian customs
officials to allow unregistered products to be imported then sold in Brazil.
In doing so, NSPâs subsidiary falsified its books, records and accounts to hide the nature
of the payments.
NSP failed to disclose those payments to Brazilian customs agents in its filings with the
Commission.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE
This Court has subject matter jurisdiction by authority of Sections 21 and Section 27 of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the âExchange Actâ) [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78u and 78aa].
Defendants, directly and indirectly, singly and in concert, have made use of the means
and instrumentalities of interstate commerce and the mails in connection with the
transactions, acts and courses of business alleged herein, certain of which have occurred

NSPâS CASH PAYMENTS TO CUSTOMS BROKERS
In 1994, NSP established a wholly-owned subsidiary in Brazil, Natures Sunshine
Produtos Naturais Ltda. (âNSP Brazilâ).
NSP Brazilâs sales in Brazil grew rapidly, and by the late 1990s, Brazil constituted NSPâs
largest foreign market.
In or about 1999-2000, the AgÃ©ncia Nacional de Vigilancia Sanitaria (âANVISAâ), a
Brazilian governmental agency responsible for regulating nutritional products, among
other things, reclassified as medicines many vitamins, herbal products, and nutritional
supplements, including products being sold by NSP Brazil and other companies.
As a result of the new regulatory requirements, NSP Brazil was required by ANVISA to
register many NSP products in order to legally import and sell them in Brazil.
NSP Brazil was unable to register many NSP products. Consequently, NSP Brazil could
not legally import and sell those NSP products in Brazil.
As a result of the restriction on the types of products NSP Brazil could import and sell,
sales by NSP Brazil declined substantially from approximately $22 million in 2000 to
approximately $2.6 million in 2003.
In an effort to circumvent the importation restrictions on many NSP products, NSP Brazil
made certain undocumented cash payments in 2000 and 2001 to facilitate the importation
of unregistered product to Brazil (âCash Paymentsââ).
NSP Brazilâs accounting records suggest that during 2000 and 2001, NSP Brazil made
Cash Payments to customs brokers totaling over $1 million, some of which were later
paid to customs officials. The Cash Payments were typically booked by NSP Brazil in its

accounting records as âimportation advances.â

The Cash Payments were used to enable NSP Brazil to import registered and unregistered
NSP products for sale in Brazil.

The recipients of some of the Cash Payments ultimately included Brazilian government
officials, so that they would allow NSP Brazil to import unregistered NSP product to sell
in Brazil.

As a result of the Cash Payments, unregistered NSP products were imported into Brazil
and sold by NSP Brazil.

The Cash Payments were not accurately recorded in NSP Brazilâs books and records
because they were characterized as legitimate importation expenses.

NSP Brazil did not have any legitimate supporting documentation for the Cash Payments.
In or about December 2000, during the period that Cash Payments were made, two
former NSP controllers, who are not defendants in this action, visited the offices of NSP
Brazil and interviewed, among several NSP Brazil employees, the operations manager for
NSP Brazil.

During the interview, NSP Brazilâs operations manager told the former NSP controllers
that he was very concerned about products NSP Brazil was importing into Brazil because
NSP Brazil did not have the proper product registration for many of the products, and
therefore some NSP products that could not legally be sold in Brazil were being imported
by NSP Brazil.

The NSP Brazil operations manager also told the former NSP controllers that pressure
from the Brazilian government made it harder for NSP Brazil to find a customs broker

willing to facilitate the importation of unregistered NSP products into Brazil.

37.

As a result, according to the operations manager, it cost NSP Brazil 25% of the value of
the product to find a customs broker willing to assist in the importation of unregistered
NSP products into Brazil.

The operations manager further explained that NSP Brazil had many months of inventory
in port because NSP Brazil could not find a customs broker willing to take the risk of
facilitating the importation of unregistered NSP products into Brazil.

The operations manager stated that some unregistered NSP products that NSP Brazil did
manage to get into Brazil as a result of the Cash Payments were sold illegally.

The operations manager stated that when he complained to the general manager of NSP
Brazil, he was told by the general manager that NSP was fully aware of the problems in
Brazil.

One of the former NSP Controllers was a corporate officer and NSP's corporate
controller. The former NSP Controllers worked in Provo, Utah and had responsibility
for, among other things, maintaining the books and records of NSP and the preparation of
NSP's financial statements regarding the inclusion of financial information for NSP's
foreign subsidiaries, including NSP Brazil. One of those former NSP Controllers also
claimed to have informed a senior manager at NSP who is no longer with the company
about the interviews of NSP Brazil employees.

In approximately November 2001, NSP Brazil hired a new controller.

38. When the new NSP Brazil controller reviewed NSP Brazilâs books, he discovered a series

of accounting entries reflecting approximately 80 cash payments for which there was no

supporting documentation. Those entries included the Cash Payments.

44.

Despite a lack of supporting documentation for the Cash Payments, NSP accounted for
the payments in their 2001 financial statements as if they were legitimate importation
expenses.
In or about 2002, in an effort to create the appearance that the Cash Payments were
legitimate importation expenses, NSP Brazil purchased fictitious supporting
documentation for the Cash Payments.
In its 2001 Form 10-K filed with the Commission in March 2002, NSP stated that NSP
Brazil had experienced a significant decline in sales âdue to import regulations imposed
by the Brazilian government.â
NSP failed to disclose in its 2001 Form 10-K, filed with the Commission, any material
information related to the Cash Payments.

DOUGLAS FAGGIOLI
At all times relevant to this complaint, Faggioli was COO of NSP and as such, had
supervisory responsibilities for the senior management and policies regarding the
worldwide manufacture, inventory and distribution of NSP's products, including the
export and sales of those products.
At all times relevant to this complaint, Faggioli's direct reports included the President of
NSP International and other senior management who were directly or indirectly
responsible for the management and policies related to the manufacture, inventory and
distribution operations of NSP world-wide, including making and keeping NSP's books
and records that accurately reflected in reasonable detail the state of registration of

products sold in Brazil and devising and maintaining a system of internal controls

sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that the registration of NSP products sold in
Brazil was adequately monitored.
Faggioli failed to adequately supervise NSP personnel in 2000 and 2001 to make and
keep books and records that accurately reflected in reasonable detail the state of
registration of NSP products sold in Brazil and to supervise NSP personnel in devising
and maintaining a system of internal controls sufficient to have provided reasonable
assurance that the registration of NSP products sold in Brazil was adequately monitored
in 2000 and 2001.

CRAIG D. HUFF
At all times relevant to this complaint, Huff was CFO of NSP and as such, had
supervisory responsibilities for the senior management and policies regarding the making

system of internal controls at NSP sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that the
registration of NSP products sold in Brazil was adequately monitored.
At all times relevant to this complaint, Huffâs direct reports included senior management

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

CORRUPT PAYMENTS TO FOREIGN OFFICIALS BY NSP
Violations of Section 30A of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78dd-1]

The Commission realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations contained in
Paragraphs | through 48 above.
As described above, NSP Brazil made illicit payments to a person or persons, while
knowing that all or a portion of those payments would be offered, given, or promised,
directly or indirectly, to foreign officials for the purposes of influencing their acts or
decisions in their official capacity, inducing them to do or fail to do actions in violation
of their lawful duties, securing an improper advantage, or inducing such foreign officials
to use their influence with a foreign government or instrumentality thereof to assist NSP
Brazil in obtaining or retaining business.
By reason of the foregoing, NSP violated, and unless restrained and enjoined may
continue to violate the anti-bribery provision of the FCPA, as codified in Section 30A of
the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78dd-1].

material fact necessary in order to make statements made, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made not misleading; or (3) engaged in acts, practices, or courses

of business that operated or would operate as a fraud and deceit upon other persons.
By reason of the foregoing, NSP, violated, and unless restrained and enjoined may

continue to violate Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§78)(b)] and Rule 10b-
5 promulgated thereunder [17 C.F.R. Â§ 240.10b-5]

13a-1, and 13a-13 [17 C.F.R. 240.12b-20, 240.13a-1, and 240.13a-13]
The Commission realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations contained in
Paragraphs | through 54, above.
Section 13(a) and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 require companies filing periodic
reports with the Commission to file accurate reports that do not omit material information
that would otherwise make the information in the filings not misleading.

thereunder by filing materially misleading Forms 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31,
2000, June 30, 2000, September 31, 2000, March 31, 2001, June 30, 2001, and

Case 2:09-cv-00672-BS/J Document2 Filed 07/31/2009 Page ii of 15

58. NSPâs filings were materially inaccurate and contained misstatements and omissions in
that, among other things:

a. NSPâs filings with the Commission failed to accurately reflect the Cash Payments
and their purpose.

b. NSPâs filings with the Commission were later supported by fictitious
documentation that erroneously characterized the Cash Payments as lawful
importation expenses.

59. By reason of the foregoing, NSP directly or indirectly, violated, and unless restrained and
enjoined may continue to violate Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78m(a)]
and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 promulgated thereunder [17 C.F.R. 240.12b-20,

60. The Commission realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations contained in
Paragraphs | through 59, above.

61. Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act requires companies to keep accurate books,
records and accounts which reflect the transactions entered into by a company and the

62. Section 13(b)(2)(B) requires companies to devise and maintain a system of internal
accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that transactions are

generally accepted accounting principles or any other criteria applicable to such
statements and to maintain accountability for such assets.

63. NSP failed to make and keep books, records and accounts that provided reasonable
assurances that the transactions it had entered into had been accounted for properly in
accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and not falsified. NSPâs
books and records did not fairly and accurately reflect the Cash Payments and their
purpose, and the fictitious supporting documentation falsely characterized the Cash
Payments as lawful payments to brokers to import legal product.

64. NSP knowingly failed to implement a system of internal controls and did not devise or
maintain a system of internal accounting controls to assure that expenditures were
properly recorded on its financial statements.

65. By reason of the foregoing, NSP, directly and indirectly, violated, and unless restrained
and enjoined may continue to violate Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the
Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78m(b)(2)(A) and (B)]

FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§ 20(a)]

66. The Commission realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations contained in
Paragraphs | through 65, above.

67. During the period 2000 through 2001, Faggioli and Huff, directly or indirectly, as Control

Persons, failed to make and keep books, records, and accounts, which in reasonable

detail, accurately and fairly reflected the transactions of NSP.

Persons, failed to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient
to provide reasonable assurances that transactions were recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles or any other criteria applicable to such statements.

69. By reason of the foregoing, Faggioli and Huff, directly and indirectly, violated, and
unless restrained and enjoined may continue to violate Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) [15
