CASE NO.:
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE
COMMISSION,
Plaintiff,
v.
ALCATEL-LUCENT, S.A.,
Defendant.
COMPLAINT

Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission alleges as follows:

I. SUMMARY

Page 1 of 24

Ls From December 2001 through June 2006, Alcatel, S.A., now called Alcatel-

Lucent, S.A. (âAlcatelâ or the âcompanyâ), through its subsidiaries and agents, violated the

Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (âFCPAâ) [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78dd-1] by paying more than $8

million in bribes to foreign government officials. Alcatel made these payments to influence acts

and decisions by these foreign government officials to obtain or retain business, with the

knowledge and approval of certain management level personnel of the relevant Alcatel

subsidiaries. Alcatel lacked sufficient internal controls to prevent or detect such improper

payments, and improperly recorded the payments in its books and records.

2. During this period, Alcatelâs agents and/or subsidiaries paid bribes to foreign

government officials in several countries to obtain or retain business:
Gase 1:10-cv-24620-XXXX Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 12/27/2010 Page 2 of 24

Â¢ From December 2001 to October 2004, Alcatelâs agents and/or subsidiaries paid at least
$7 million in bribes to government officials of Costa Rica to obtain or retain three
contracts to provide telephone services in Costa Rica totaling approximately $303
million.

Â¢ From December 2002 to June 2006, Alcatelâs agents and/or subsidiaries paid bribes to
government officials of Honduras to obtain or retain five telecommunications contracts
totaling approximately $48 million.

e From October 2003 to May 2004, Alcatelâs agents and/or subsidiaries paid bribes to
government officials of Taiwan to obtain or retain a railway axle counting contract
valued at approximately $27 million.

e From October 2004 to February 2006, Alcatelâs agents and/or subsidiaries paid bribes to
government officials of Malaysia to obtain or retain a telecommunications contract
valued at approximately $85 million.

3. All of these payments were undocumented or improperly recorded as consulting
fees in the books of Alcatelâs subsidiaries, and then consolidated into Alcatelâs financial
statements. A lax corporate control environment aided Alcatelâs improper conduct. Alcatel
failed to detect or investigate numerous red flags suggesting that its business consultants were
likely making illicit payments and gifts to government officials in these countries at the direction
of certain Alcatel employees. The respective heads of several Alcatel subsidiaries and
geographical regions, some of whom reported directly to Alcatelâs executive committee,
authorized extremely high commission payments under circumstances in which they failed to

determine whether such payments were, in part, to be funneled to government officials in
Gase 1:10-cv-24620-XXXX Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 12/27/2010 Page 3 of 24

violation of the FCPA. These high-level employees therefore knew, or were severely reckless in
not knowing, that Alcatel paid bribes to foreign government officials.

4. By making these payments, Alcatel violated the FCPA as incorporated into the
federal securities laws as Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ), and also violated Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act.

5. Unless restrained and enjoined, Alcatel is reasonably likely to continue to engage

in the acts and practices set forth in this complaint and in acts and practices of similar purport

and object.
Il. JURISDICTION AND VENUE
6. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 21(d), 21(e), and

27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78u(d), 78u(e), and 78aa].

7. Personal jurisdiction and venue are appropriate in this Court under Section 27 of
the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78aa].

8. Alcatel, directly or indirectly, made use of the means or instrumentalities of
interstate commerce, of the mails, or of the facilities of a national securities exchange in
connection with the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business alleged in this
complaint.

Il. DEFENDANT

9. Alcatel-Lucent, S.A. (âAlcatelâ), formerly known as Alcatel, S.A., a French
corporation headquartered in Paris, France, is one of the worldâs largest providers of
telecommunications equipment and services, with more than 75,000 employees in 140 countries,
including the United States. Until November 30, 2006, Alcatelâs American Depository Receipts

(âADRsâ) were registered with the Commission pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(b) and
Gase 1:10-cv-24620-XXXX Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 12/27/2010 Page 4 of 24

traded on the New York Stock Exchange (âNYSEâ). As such, during the time the relevant
conduct occurred, Alcatel was required to file reports with the Commission under Section 13 of
the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78m], and was an âissuerâ within the meaning of the FCPA [15
US.C. Â§ 78dd-1]. Alcatel conducted its commercial transactions through its subsidiaries,
including Alcatel CIT, S.A. and Alcatel SEL, AG. On November 30, 2006, an Alcatel subsidiary
merged with Lucent Technologies Inc. in the United States and Alcatel changed its name to
Alcatel-Lucent, S.A. After the merger, the companyâs shares were traded on the Paris Euronext
exchange and as ADRs on the NYSE.
IV. RELATED ENTITIES

10. Alcatel CIT, S.A., now known as Alcatel-Lucent France, S.A., a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Alcatel in France, sold telephone technology and networks to telecommunications
providers owned by foreign governments, including the governments of Costa Rica, Honduras,
and Malaysia, and paid Alcatelâs business consultants in those countries. Alcatel CITâs financial
results were included in the consolidated financial statements that Alcatel filed with the
Commission. Alcatel CIT maintained a bank account at ABN Amro Bank in New York, NY,
which was used, in part, to pay business consultants located around the world.

11. Alcatel Standard A.G., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alcatel in Switzerland that
in 2007 was merged into Alcatel-Lucent Trade International A.G., entered into most agreements
with business consultants worldwide on behalf of Alcatel CIT and other Alcatel entities,
including the agreements that are referenced in this complaint.

12. Alcatel de Costa Rica S.A., now known as Alcatel Centroamerica S.A., a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Alcatel in Costa Rica, was responsible for the day-to-day

commercial operations of Alcatel in Costa Rica and Honduras. Throughout the relevant time
Gase 1:10-cv-24620-XXXX Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 12/27/2010 Page 5 of 24

period, Alcatel de Costa Ricaâs financial results were included in the consolidated financial
statements that Alcatel filed with the Commission.

13. Alcatel SEL, A.G., now known as Alcatel-Lucent Deutschland A.G., a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Alcatel in Germany, participated in bidding for railway projects in Taiwan.
Throughout the relevant time period, Alcatel SELâs financial results were included in the
consolidated financial statements that Alcatel filed with the Commission.

14. Alcatel Malaysia, a majority-owned subsidiary of Alcatel in Malaysia, was
responsible for the day-to-day commercial operations of Alcatel in Malaysia. Alcatel currently
owns 51% of its shares. Two private local entities own the remaining shares. Alcatel Malaysiaâs
financial results were consolidated in the financial statements Alcatel filed with the Commission.

V. FACTS

15. Alcatel, the parent issuer, was run by an executive committee made up of very
senior officers, including the CEO and CFO, and a handful of support staff. Alcatel itself did not
conduct actual business with any customer. Starting in the 1990s, Alcatel utilized a consistent
strategy to obtain contracts in many parts of the world, under which Alcatel typically used a
subsidiary in the country to obtain contracts. The subsidiaryâs âcountry senior officerâ managed
the subsidiary and selected business consultants purportedly to provide sales, marketing, and
technical support and, in some cases, to lobby government officials to obtain public contracts in
that country.

16. Alcatel used Alcatel Standard to conduct very limited due diligence on the
business consultants. The country senior officer then prepared a cursory description of the
services the business consultants would perform and the compensation they would receive.

Based on the limited information provided to them, the heads of Alcatel Standard, of the
Gase 1:10-cv-24620-XXXX Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 12/27/2010 Page 6 of 24

subsidiary with the customer contract (Alcatel CIT for most of the agreements that are referenced
in this complaint), and of various geographical regions all approved the retention of the
consultants.

17. After having obtained all necessary approvals for the retention of the business
consultant, Alcatel Standard entered into an agreement with the consultant, usually requiring the
consultant to perform vaguely-described marketing services. The subsidiary with the customer
contract (Alcatel CIT for most of the agreements that are referenced in this complaint) typically
paid the consultants, usually after it had successfully obtained and executed contracts with the
government to sell telecommunications services and equipment. In every bribery scheme
described in this complaint, the respective heads of the relevant subsidiaries and geographic
regions either were aware of, or ignored, significant red flags that indicated that the respective
country senior officers and other Alcatel employees were using business consultants to pay
bribes to foreign government officials.

18. Alcatelâs internal controls over payments to its business consultants in foreign
countries were weak at best. Although at some point Alcatel utilized more than 235 business
consultants in more than 70 countries, the employees responsible for reviewing due diligence
reports on the companyâs business consultants sometimes did not speak the language in which
these reports were written, and had little or no understanding of these consultantsâ background or
the tasks they purportedly performed.

19. | While Alcatel had a company-wide FCPA training program, Alcatelâs employees
routinely disregarded or circumvented it. For example, a former high-level employee and the
president of Alcatel Standard trained country senior officers, including those who conducted

business in Latin America and Taiwan, on how to âpaperâ consulting agreements so that Alcatel
Gase 1:10-cv-24620-XXXX Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 12/27/2010 Page 7 of 24

Standard would authorize them. The controls Alcatel had in place were insufficient to prevent
bribery because Alcatel employees either disregarded or circumvented them by providing
incomplete and inaccurate information to those involved in the review process. Finally, although
Alcatel had a risk assessment committee, it typically focused on issues that were likely to result
in customer lawsuits and not on bribery or excessive commissions to business consultants.

A. The Costa Rica Bribery Scheme

20. From December 2001 to October 2004, Alcatel bribed government officials in
Costa Rica to obtain telecommunications contracts valued at approximately $303 million.

21. The Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (the âICEâ) is the Costa Rican
government-owned company that provides telecommunications services, evaluates bids, and
awards telecommunications contracts in Costa Rica. The ICE was governed by a seven-member
board of directors that evaluated and approved, on behalf of the government of Costa Rica, all
bid proposals submitted by telecommunications companies. The Board of Directors was led by
an Executive President, who was appointed by the President of Costa Rica. The other members
of the Board of Directors were appointed by the President of Costa Rica and the Costa Rican
governing cabinet.

22. Prior to 2001, Alcatel CIT was not able to secure mobile telecommunications
contracts from the ICE. Among other things, the ICE was using a different technology from the
GSM technology Alcatel CIT was offering. In late 2000, Edgar Valverde, at the time the
President and Country Senior Officer of Alcatel de Costa Rica, and Christian Sapsizian, Alcatel
CITâs Director for Latin America from February 1996 until October 2004, enlisted two Costa
Rican consulting companies with many contacts at the ICE (âCosta Rican Consultant Aâ and

âCosta Rican Consultant Bâ) to assist Alcatel in obtaining mobile telecommunications contracts.
Gase 1:10-cv-24620-XXXX Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 12/27/2010 Page 8 of 24

Valverde and Sapsizian hired the consultants in part to bribe officials in the government of Costa
Rica in exchange for telecommunications contracts.

23.  Valverdeâs brother-in-law owned and controlled Costa Rican Consultant A.
However, Valverde intentionally omitted this fact from the company profile he prepared and
submitted to Alcatel Standard. Alcatel Standard failed to conduct adequate due diligence on
Costa Rican Consultant A and, therefore, never identified its registered shareholders and ultimate
beneficial owner.

24. In November 2000, prior to a formal vote by the ICE Board of Directors,
Sapsizian and Valverde offered a bribe to an ICE director (âICE Director Aâ) to be paid through
Costa Rican Consultant A. Specifically, they offered him 1.5% to 2% of the value of a contract
to develop a GSM mobile network in Costa Rica and provide 400,000 lines of mobile telephone
service (the â400K GSM Contractâ). The bribe was in exchange for his assistance in opening a
bid round for a GSM-based mobile network and to assist Alcatel CIT in obtaining contracts from
the ICE. With ICE Director Aâs hired influence, the ICE Board formally voted to open a bid
round for developing a mobile network in Costa Rica using the GSM technology.

25. On June 12, 2001, in part because of ICE Director Aâs assistance, the ICE
awarded Alcatel CIT a contract, valued at approximately $44 million, to supply equipment for
the ICE fixed network. On August 28, 2001, in part because of ICE Director Aâs assistance, the
ICE awarded Alcatel CIT a second contract, the 400K GSM Contract, which gave Alcatel CIT
100% of all new mobile lines installed in Costa Rica and 50% of all existing mobile lines. The
contract was valued at approximately $149.5 million. In May 2002, in part because of ICE
Director Aâs assistance, the ICE awarded Alcatel CIT a third contract, for the expansion of the

fixed telephone lines central stations, valued at approximately $109.4 million.
Gase 1:10-cv-24620-XXXX Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 12/27/2010 Page 9 of 24

26. From March 2001 to March 2003, Alcatel Standard, on behalf of Alcatel CIT,
executed at least five consulting agreements with Costa Rican Consultant A, in which Alcatel
CIT promised to pay up to 9.75% of the value of any contract it assisted Alcatel CIT in obtaining
with the ICE - a much higher commission rate than normally awarded to such a consultant. In
return, the consulting agreements required Costa Rican Consultant A to perform vaguely-
described marketing and advisory services. Costa Rican Consultant A created invoices
purportedly for commissions related to the contracts awarded to Alcatel CIT. It then submitted
those invoices, through Valverde, to Alcatel CIT.

27. Starting in December 2001, after the ICE awarded Alcatel its first two contracts,
and continuing until October 2003, Alcatel CIT transferred from its account at ABN Amro Bank
in New York approximately $14.5 million to an account at the International Bank of Miami in
Miami, Florida, to be further credited to Costa Rican Consultant Aâs account at Cuscatlan
Intemational Bank in Costa Rica. This $14.5 million fee bore no relation to actual services Costa
Rican Consultant A provided. In reality, it was to be used largely to pay bribes to government
officials. Costa Rican Consultant A used at least $7 million of that money to pay officials of the
government of Costa Rica for assisting Alcatel CIT in obtaining and retaining business in Costa

Rica, including:

 

Position Approximate Amount of Bribe

 

ICE Director A $2.56 million in addition to certificates of
deposit totaling $100,000

 

High-ranking executive branch official $950,000 received through ICE Director A

 

 

 

 

 

 

ICE CEO $945,000
ICE Administrator $145,000
ICE Administrator $110,000

 
Gase 1:10-cv-24620-XXXX Document1 Entered on FLSD Docket 12/27/2010 Page 10 of 24

 

Presidential Candidate $100,000

 

ICE Director B $1.3 million

 

Party leader in Congress for the Social
Christian Unity Party $550,000

 

 

 

 

28. Similarly, from March 2001 to December 2002, Alcatel Standard, on behalf of
Alcatel CIT, executed at least four consulting agreements with Costa Rican Consultant B to
assist Alcatel in obtaining telecommunications contracts in Costa Rica. The agreements required
Costa Rican Consultant B to perform vaguely-described advisory services. Costa Rican
Consultant B then created phony invoices, purportedly for commissions related to the contracts
awarded to Alcatel, and submitted those invoices to Alcatel CIT. As with Costa Rican
Consultant A, Alcatel authorized Costa Rican Consultant B to receive a much higher commission
rate on certain projects than normally awarded to such a consultant.

29. Alcatel CIT transferred from its account at ABN Amro Bank in New York
approximately $3.9 million to Costa Rican Consultant B. This fee also bore no relation to actual
services Costa Rican Consultant B provided and was also to be used to pay bribes to government
officials. Costa Rican Consultant B paid officials of the government of Costa Rica, including at
least $930,000 to ICE director C from December 2002 until June 2004.

30. The President of Area 1, which encompassed Latin America, worked in Alcatelâs
Miami office between 2000 and 2003 (and directly reported to a member of Alcatelâs executive
committee). This individual approved the payments to the Costa Rican consultants, despite their
high amounts. On several occasions, this individual stated that he could go to jail if authorities

in France or the United States uncovered where these payments were actually going.

10
Gase 1:10-cv-24620-XXXX Document1 Entered on FLSD Docket 12/27/2010 Page 11 of 24

31. The president of Alcatel Standard, who also held the title of Director of
International Affairs and reported to Alcatelâs controller, also approved the retention of and
payment to these consultants despite numerous red flags that should have alerted him that these
payments were unlawful, such as the large size of the commissions and the fact that Alcatel CIT
already had two other consultants in such a small country as Costa Rica.

32. Some of the key Alcatel employees who were responsible for reviewing progress
reports on the companyâs consultants in Costa Rica did not speak Spanish and, therefore, could
not understand the reports that contained information about the work these consultants
purportedly performed. As a result, they relied on Sapsizian to translate documents and assure
them that the consultants in question were doing the work they were engaged to do.

33. Sapsizian also approved the payment of approximately $25,000 in expenses
incurred by ICE officials during a trip to Paris in October 2003 while Alcatel CIT was attempting
to obtain an extension of a fixed network contract in Costa Rica. He instructed an Alcatel CIT
employee to pay for some of these expenses in cash to conceal the payments and avoid leaving a
paper trail leading to Alcatel. All of these payments were intended to reward these government
officials for providing Alcatel CIT with lucrative contracts.

34. All of these officials were âforeign officialsâ within the meaning of the FCPA and
were in a significant position to influence the policy decisions the ICE made.

B. The Honduras Bribery Scheme

35. From December 2002 to June 2006, Alcatel bribed government officials in
Honduras to obtain or retain at least five telecommunications contracts valued at approximately

$48 million.

11
Gase 1:10-cv-24620-XXXX Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 12/27/2010 Page 12 of 24

36. In February 2002, in Key Biscayne, Florida, Sapsizian and another Alcatel CIT
employee met with the brother of a high-ranking executive branch official in the government of
Honduras to discuss how the brothers and Alcatel could assist each other. Sapsizian participated
in this meeting to make sure the brothers understood that Alcatelâs upper management in France
supported any promise made to them. The executive branch officialâs brother requested that
Alcatel retain a specific consulting company in Honduras (âHonduran Consultantâ).

37. Later in 2002, Alcatel CIT informally retained the Honduran Consultant and
promised to pay it commissions of 3% to 5% of the value of certain contracts Alcatel CIT
secured in Honduras. The Honduran Consultant represented perfume and cosmetics companies
in Honduras and operated as an exclusive distributor of brand name fragrances. The Honduran
Consultant had no contacts in, or prior experience with, the telecommunications industry in
Honduras. The executive branch officialâs brother controlled the Honduran Consultant and
Alcatel CITâs sole purpose for retaining this consultant was to gain access to the high-ranking
executive branch official and influence the decisions of the Empresa Hondurefia de
Telecomunicaciones (âHondutelââ), the Honduran government-owned telecommunications
provider responsible for awarding and administering public tenders for telecommunications
contracts in Honduras.

38. As a result of Alcatelâs agreement to retain and pay the Honduran Consultant,
there was significant pressure on Hondutel, and on the senior government officials sitting on its
Board of Directors, to keep Alcatel CIT and another Alcatel subsidiary as the contractors on five
contracts which were awarded from 2002 through 2003, worth a total of about $48 million, in
spite of significant failures in performance that could have resulted in termination under the

terms of the agreement. These contracts included a $2.36 million contract signed on November

12
Gase 1:10-cv-24620-XXXX Document1 Entered on FLSD Docket 12/27/2010 Page 13 of 24

12, 2002; a $17.92 million contract signed on May 12, 2003; a $7.91 million contract signed on
October 27, 2003; a $2.49 million contract signed on December 6, 2003, and a $17.39 million
contract signed on December 12, 2003. At least one of these contracts was never presented to
the public and was awarded directly to Alcatel.

39. Alcatel Standard did not memorialize its agreement with the Honduran Consultant
until October 2003, after Hondutel had already awarded two contracts to Alcatel CIT, at which
time it formally retained the Honduran Consultant to perform vaguely-described marketing and
advisory services. At that time, Alcatel Standard memorialized its agreement to pay the
Honduran Consultant commissions of 3% to 5% of the value of certain contracts Alcatel CIT and
another Alcatel subsidiary secured in Honduras.

40. Alcatel Standard knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that the Honduran
Consultant was a conduit to pay bribes. Alcatel Standard failed to conduct adequate due
diligence about the Honduran Consultant and did not uncover its relationship with the high-
ranking executive branch official, despite a number of red flags. First, the Honduran Consultant
was a perfume distributor with no experience in telecommunications. Second, the executive
branch officialâs brother regularly communicated with Alcatel employees via an e-mail address
from a domain name affiliated with the executive branch official and his family. Third, at some
point in late 2003, the executive branch official and his brother directly contacted the President
of Area 1 in an effort to collect sales commissions Alcatel purportedly owed to the Honduran
Consultant. Finally, the President of Area 1 was aware of the relationship between the Honduran
Consultant and the executive branch officialâs brother, and personally met with the executive

branch official to discuss Alcatelâs expansion in Honduras.

13
Gase 1:10-cv-24620-XXXX Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 12/27/2010 Page 14 of 24

41. Following efforts by the high-ranking executive branch official and his brother to
pressure Alcatel to pay the Honduran Consultant, Alcatel paid $704,388 to the Honduran
Consultant between September 2004 and June 2006. The President of Area 1 allowed these
payments despite knowing that the Honduran Consultant was a perfume distributor controlled by
the brother of the executive branch official. Although the press widely covered the bribery
scheme in Costa Rica beginning in October 2004, and Alcatelâs executive committee knew at
that time that Sapsizian and Valverde paid bribes at the highest level of the Costa Rican
government using sham consultants, Alcatel took no steps to terminate the Honduran Consultant
and Alcatel CIT continued to make these illicit payments until June 2006. Although it is
unknown whether the Honduran Consultant shared this money with the executive branch official,
Sapsizian had every expectation that money Alcatel paid to the Honduran Consultant would flow
to the executive branch official.

42. Alcatel CIT also paid for Hondutelâs general manager and his wife to travel to
Europe in June 2003 and for his daughter to travel to Europe in 2004, without any legitimate
business purposes. Alcatel CIT also paid for the president of Conatel, the Honduran government
agency that regulated the telecommunications sector in Honduras, who had close ties to the
executive branch official, to travel to various conferences, including in Paris, France in July 2003
and in Cannes, France in December 2004. Finally, Alcatel CIT paid for a Hondutel attorney and
her daughter to travel to Paris in June 2003, a trip which consisted almost entirely of leisure
activities and featured a private driver. In March 2004, Alcatel CIT also paid $1,500 to this
Hondutel attorney.

43. All of these officials were âforeign officialsâ within the meaning of the FCPA and

were in a significant position to influence the policy decisions Hondutel made.

Cc. The Taiwan Bribery Scheme

44. From October 2003 to May 2004, Alcatel bribed government officials in Taiwan
to obtain a railway axle counting contract valued at approximately $27 million.

45. A senior Alcatel employee, at the time Director of International Business and
Sales at Alcatel SEL AG, an Alcatel subsidiary, (âAlcatel SEL employeeâ) hired two consultants
in Taiwan (âTaiwanese Consultant Aâ and âTaiwanese Consultant Bâ) in 2000 and 2002,
respectively. Both consultants possessed close ties to legislators in the Taiwanese government.

46. The Alcatel SEL employee hired Taiwanese Consultant A in 2000 to pressure the
Taiwan Railway Administration (the âTRAâ) to act in Alcatelâs favor in the bid process. The
TRA, a Taiwanese government-owned authority, was responsible for awarding and
administering public tenders for contracts to manufacture and install axle counting systems to
facilitate rail traffic in Taiwan. The TRA was an agency of Taiwanâs Ministry of Transportation
and Communications, a cabinet-level governmental body responsible for the regulation of
transportation and communications networks and operations.

47. As with most consultants hired by Alcatel, Taiwanese Consultant A entered into a
consulting agreement with Alcatel Standard. In the course of its due diligence, Alcatel Standard
repeatedly requested more information concerning Taiwanese Consultant A from Alcatel SEL.
Although Alcatel SEL only provided limited information about Taiwanese Consultant A, Alcatel
Standard circumvented its own procedures and approved the consulting agreement.
Additionally, the Alcatel SEL employee subsequently amended this agreement to increase
Taiwanese Consultant Aâs compensation, without following Alcatelâs procedure for the

amendment of consulting agreements.

15
Gase 1:10-cv-24620-XXXX Document1 Entered on FLSD Docket 12/27/2010 Page 16 of 24

48. In May 2004, Alcatel SEL paid a commission of approximately $920,000 to
Taiwanese Consultant A through its account at ABN Amro Bank in New York. At various
times, Taiwanese Consultant A paid bribes to two Taiwanese legislators, Legislator A and
Legislator B.

49. Legislator A assisted Alcatel in convincing the TRA that Alcatel SELâs system
satisfied the technical requirements of the tenders. He also publicly supported Alcatel SELâs bid
and provided advice to Alcatel SEL concerning its TRA documents. Legislator B, in turn, was
requested to alter the TRAâs technical specifications to improve Alcatel SELâs bidding chances.
Although it is unclear how much of Alcatel SELâs $920,000 eventually flowed to foreign
government officials, the owner of Taiwanese Consultant A promised $180,000 in campaign
funds for Legislator Bâs 2004 election and paid him at least $90,000 in 2004, after Alcatel SELâs
affiliate won the bid.

50. The Alcatel SEL employee and Taiwanese Consultant A also spent approximately
$10,000 to arrange trips to Germany in October 2003 for the secretary to the Taiwan
Transportation and Communications Minister, and in 2002 for an assistant in the office of
Legislator A. Both trips were for personal, entertainment purposes, and the secretary to the
Taiwan Transportation and Communications Minister invited his ex-wife at Alcatelâs expense.
Alcatel SEL paid for the hotel directly and reimbursed the Alcatel SEL employee for travel
expenses, including train tickets, taxis, lavish meals, and small gifts. Alcatel SELâs management
in Germany knew of and approved reimbursement of many of these expenses.

51. | Without Alcatel Standardâs approval, the Alcatel SEL employee hired Taiwanese
Consultant B in 2002, because its owner was the brother of another Taiwanese legislator,

Legislator C. To bribe Legislator C, the Alcatel SEL employee and others created a phony

16
Gase 1:10-cv-24620-XXXX Document1 Entered on FLSD Docket 12/27/2010 Page 17 of 24

consulting agreement between an Alcatel affiliate and Taiwanese Consultant B, even though
Taiwanese Consultant B was never expected to provide any services to Alcatel or its affiliate.
An Alcatel affiliate paid approximately $36,000 to Taiwanese Consultant B in 2004.

52. Legislators A, B, and C were âforeign officialsâ within the meaning of the FCPA
and were in a significant position to influence the policy decisions the TRA made.

53. The fees Alcatel SEL and Alcatelâs affiliate paid to Taiwanese Consultant A and
Taiwanese Consultant B, respectively, bore no relation to actual services these entities provided
to Alcatel.

54. On December 30, 2003, the TRA accepted an Alcatel affiliateâs price bid and
granted the affiliate a supply contract worth approximately $27 million.

D. The Malaysia Bribery Scheme

55. From October 2004 to February 2006, Alcatel bribed government officials in
Malaysia to obtain confidential information relating to a public tender that Alcatel ultimately
won, the result of which yielded a telecommunications contract valued at approximately $85
million.

56. Telekom Malaysia is the Malaysian government-owned telecommunications
company that provides telecommunications services, evaluates bids, and awards
telecommunications contracts in Malaysia. The Malaysian Ministry of Finance owned
approximately 43% of Telekom Malaysiaâs shares, had veto power over all its major
expenditures, and made its key operational decisions. The government owned its interest in
Telekom Malaysia through the Minister of Finance, who had the status of a âspecial

shareholder.â Most senior Telekom Malaysia officers were political appointees, including the

17
Gase 1:10-cv-24620-XXXX Document1 Entered on FLSD Docket 12/27/2010 Page 18 of 24

Chairman and Director, the Chairman of the Board of the Tender Committee, and the Executive
Director.

57. Between October 2004 and February 2006, Alcatel Malaysia personnel paid
bribes to employees of Telekom Malaysia in exchange for non-public information. This non-
public information included important documents and budget information relating to ongoing
bids and competitor pricing information. Alcatel Malaysiaâs management consented to these
payments.

58. These bribes assisted Alcatel Malaysia in obtaining a contract with a potential
value of $85 million.

59. | The Telekom Malaysia employees who received bribes were âforeign officialsâ
within the meaning of the FCPA and were in a significant position to influence the policy
decisions Telekom Malaysia made.

60. Alcatel Standard also made significant lump-sum payments through U.S. bank
accounts to two consultants (âMalaysian Consultant Aâ and âMalaysian Consultant Bâ),
purportedly for market research.

61. Alcatel Standard paid $200,000 to Malaysian Consultant A in 2005 for a series of
âmarket reportsâ describing conditions in the Malaysian telecommunications market. Similarly,
Alcatel Standard paid $500,000 to Malaysian Consultant B in 2005 for a âstrategic intelligence
report.â

62. However, the work product these consultants prepared could not justify the size of
Alcatel Standardâs payments. In fact, Malaysian Consultant A and Malaysian Consultant B did

not appear to render any legitimate services to Alcatel Malaysia in connection with these

payments.

18
Gase 1:10-cv-24620-XXXX Document1 Entered on FLSD Docket 12/27/2010 Page 19 of 24

63. These consultants also worked for Alcatel Malaysia before formal agreements
were finalized and executed, under what they called âgentlemenâs agreements,â which required
that consulting agreements be entered into retroactively. This process allowed consultants to
work for Alcatel Malaysia without being properly vetted through Alcatel Standardâs due
diligence process.

E. Alcatel Employed U.S. Means to Engage in Bribery

64. Alcatel made bribe payments directly or indirectly to foreign government officials
in connection with numerous projects involving business in Costa Rica, Honduras, Taiwan, and
Malaysia, including using the mails and other means and instrumentalities of United States
interstate commerce. The use of interstate commerce in connection with bribery included
making illegal payments through United States banks; conducting meetings in the United States
in furtherance of a bribery scheme; signing or approving sham consulting agreements in the
United States to conceal the bribery scheme; and transmitting mail, electronic mail, and facsimile
messages in and out of the United States.

F. Alcatel Failed to Maintain Its Books and Records

65. Alcatel made numerous payments to third parties in ways that obscured the
purpose for, and the ultimate recipients of, the payments. In particular, Alcatel CIT and Alcatel
SEL together paid more than $8 million in bribes to foreign government officials. Doing so
involved the falsification of Alcatelâs books and records by employees throughout the company
(including at Alcatel CIT, Alcatel Standard, Alcatel SEL, and Alcatel Malaysia). Specifically,
Alcatel failed to keep accurate books and records by (1) entering into consulting agreements
retroactively; (2) establishing and using a system of intermediaries to obscure the source and

destination of funds; (3) making payments pursuant to business consulting agreements that

19
Gase 1:10-cv-24620-XXXX Document1 Entered on FLSD Docket 12/27/2010 Page 20 of 24

inaccurately described the services provided; (4) generating false invoices and other false
documents to justify payments; (5) disbursing funds in cash with inaccurate documentation
authorizing or supporting the withdrawals; (6) recording illicit payments as legitimate consulting
fees; and (7) recording bribes as payment for legitimate services.

G. Alcatel Failed to Maintain Adequate Internal Controls

66. Alcatel failed to implement adequate internal controls to comply with the
companyâs NYSE listing, including the detection and prevention of violations of the FCPA.
First, Alcatel and/or its subsidiaries falsified books and records, entered into agreements
retroactively, and obscured the purpose for, and ultimate recipient of, illicit payments. Alcatel
used business consultants and intermediaries to funnel bribes in at least four countries. Alcatel
created and used false invoices and payment documentation under business consulting
agreements that described services that were never intended to be rendered. Illicit payments
were falsely recorded as expenses for consulting fees.

67. Second, Alcatel also routinely circumvented the internal controls the company
had in place. Although the company in theory had a policy of âchecks and balancesâ to
authorize the retention of business consultants, which required several signatures to approve the
retention of, and payment to, business consultants, Alcatel employees often violated that policy.
In numerous instances, Alcatel officials responsible for reviewing due diligence reports on
consultants failed to conduct any review of the documents or could not read the language in
which the documents were written. Alcatel employees also entered into agreements retroactively
and obscured the amounts paid to business consultants by splitting the payments among separate
agreements (to conceal the high commissions Alcatel paid). Finally, Alcatel Standardâs due

diligence on business consultants was inadequate, and Alcatel CIT often paid business

20
Gase 1:10-cv-24620-XXXX Document1 Entered on FLSD Docket 12/27/2010 Page 21 of 24

consultants without adequate proof of services rendered. Alcatel CIT failed to establish robust
controls over cash disbursements, allowed manual payments without documentation, and
Alcatelâs FCPA compliance function was understaffed and lacked: independence. Alcatel also
failed to conduct thorough anti-bribery and corruption training.
