SEC Charges Former CEO of Chilean-Based Chemical and Mining
Company With FCPA Violations

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2018-212

Washington D.C., Sept. 25, 2018 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that the former CEO of Chilean-based
chemical and mining company Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile, S.A. (SQM) has agreed to pay $125,000 to resolve charges that he
violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).

According to the SECâs order, over the course of seven years, SQM's then-CEO Patricio Contesse Gonzalez caused SQM to make nearly $15
million in improper payments to Chilean political figures and others connected to them. Last year, SQM paid $30 million to settle parallel civil
and criminal charges against the company.

The SECâs order against Contesse finds that he directed and authorized these improper payments through a discretionary CEO account. The
payments were supported by fake documentation submitted to SQM by individuals and entities posing as legitimate vendors. Contesse
caused the related false accounting entries in SQMâs books and records and also lied to SQMâs independent auditor and signed false
certifications in SQMâs filings.

âCorporate culture starts at the top, and when misconduct is directed by the highest level of management it is critical that they are held
accountable for their conduct,â said Charles E. Cain, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Divisionâs FCPA Unit.

Contesse agreed to the settlement without admitting or denying the findings in the SECâs order.
The SECâs investigation was conducted by William B. McKean, Tanya G. Beard and Laurie J. Abbott.
