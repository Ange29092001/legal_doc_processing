COMPLAINT

Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (the âCommissionâ) alleges that:
SUMMARY

1. Pride International, Inc. (âPrideâ) is one of the worldâs largest offshore drilling
companies. In or about early 2006, through its internal controls processes, Pride discovered
evidence of improper payments during the time period from 2003 to 2005 in Latin America.
Pride made a voluntary disclosure to the Commission staff and undertook an internal
investigation under the direction of the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors. Pride also
undertook a worldwide compliance review of other international operations. Pride cooperated
fully with the Commission staff throughout its internal investigation and compliance review.

2. From approximately 2003 to 2005, Joe Summers authorized or allowed payments
totaling approximately $384,000 to third-party companies believing that all or a portion of the
funds would be given to an official of Venezuelaâs state-owned oil company in order to secure
extensions of three drilling contracts. In addition, Summers authorized the payment of

approximately $30,000 to a third party believing that all or a portion of the funds would be given
to an employee of Venezuelaâs state-owned oil company in order to secure an improper
advantage in obtaining the payment of certain receivables.

3. By engaging in the conduct described in this Complaint, Summers violated
Sections 13(b)(5) and 30A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ) [15 U.S.C.
Â§Â§ 78m(b)(5) and 78dd-1] and Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 [17 C.F.R. Â§ 240.13b2-1] and aided
and abetted Prideâs violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 30A of the Exchange
Act [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78m(b)(2)(A), 78m(b)(2)(B), and 78dd-1}.

4. The Commission brings this action against Summers seeking injunctive relief to
prevent future violations of the federal securities laws and a civil penalty.

JURISDICTION

Ds This Court has jurisdiction over this action under Sections 21(d), 21(e), and 27 of
the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78u(d), 78u(e), and 78aa]. In connection with the conduct
described herein, Summers, directly or indirectly, made use of means or instrumentalities of
interstate commerce, of mails, or of facilities of a national securities exchange in connection with
the transactions, practices, and courses of business alleged in this Complaint.

6. Venue in the Southern District of Texas is proper pursuant to Section 27 of the
Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78aa] because certain acts or transactions constituting the violations
by Summers occurred in this district.

DEFENDANT AND OTHER ENTITIES

7. Defendant Joe Summers is a U.S. citizen and resident of John Day, Oregon.
Summers was nominally employed by Pride International Personnel Ltdâa wholly owned
subsidiary of Pride, incorporated in, and with its principal place of business located in, the

British Virgin Islandsâand was responsible for managing the operations of Pride Foramer de

SEC v. Summers Page 2
Complaint
Venezuela S.A. Summers functioned, however, as an âemployeeâ and/or âagentâ of Pride.
Summers reported to, and was controlled by, Houston-based Pride officers. Summers was
responsible for, among other things, ensuring that Pride conducted its Venezuelan operations in
compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, that adequate controls were in place to
prevent illegal payments, and that the companyâs books and records were accurate. When
subpoenaed to testify by the Commissionâs staff during its investigation, Summers asserted his
Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.

8. Pride International, Inc. is a Delaware corporation headquartered in Houston,
Texas. Its common stock is registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and trades on
the New York Stock Exchange.

9. Pride Forasol S.A.S. (âPride Forasolâ) is organized and has its principal place of
business in France. Pride Forasol was acquired by Pride in 1997. As relevant to the conduct
alleged, Pride Forasol operated through Pride Foramer de Venezuela S.A., a branch of Pride
Forasolâs wholly owned subsidiary Pride Foramer S.A.S., which operated in Venezuela
(hereinafter âPride Foramer Venezuelaâ).

10. At all times relevant to this Complaint, the financial results of the entities
referenced in paragraph 9 were consolidated into the financial results for Pride.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND
Payments to Extend Contracts in Venezuela

11. âIn early 2003, a Pride Foramer rig operated in Venezuela on a drilling contract

with the Venezuelan state-owned oil company, Petrdleos de Venezuela S.A. (âPDVSAâ), that

was coming up for renewal or termination in February 2003.

SEC y. Summers Page 3
Complaint
12. In or around February 2003, an individual purporting to represent a PDVSA
official (the âVenezuela Intermediaryâ) told Summers that the PDVSA official could assist the
company in obtaining an extension of the drilling contract in exchange for a payment of $60,000
per month for each month that the contract was extended.

13. PDVSA extended the drilling contract from April 2003 to mid-July 2003. In or
around mid-2003, Summers authorized payments totaling approximately $120,000, through a
vendor of Pride Foramer Venezuela, to a Miami bank account in the name of the Venezuela
Intermediary, believing that all or a portion of the funds would be given to the PDVSA official.

14. In or around April 2004, a Pride Foramer Venezuela operations employee (the
âOperations Employeeâ) believed that the same PDVSA official was blocking or planned to
block contract extensions for two rig management contracts with PDVSA, at least in part
because Pride Foramer Venezuela had refused to make a third payment of $60,000 for the 2003
drilling contract extension. In or around May 2004, Summers authorized an additional payment
to the Venezuela Intermediary of $60,000 in connection with the 2003 drilling contract
extension, believing that all or a portion of the funds would be given by the Venezuela
Intermediary to the PDVSA official. In or around May 2004, Summers was informed by the
Operations Employee of the potential for additional payments of $12,000 per rig, per month to
be made for each month that the rig management contracts were extended.

15. From approximately mid-2004 to the end of 2004, Pride Foramer Venezuela made
the monthly payments to the Venezuela Intermediary through certain of its local vendors. In or
around December 2004, Summers left Venezuela to assume a new position at Pride in another
country. In or around December 2004, without Summersâ involvement, Pride retained a

marketing agent in Venezuela (the âVenezuela Agentâ). From in or around January 2005 to in or

SEC v. Summers Page 4
Complaint
around June 2005, Pride Foramer Venezuela made the monthly payments to the Venezuela
Intermediary through the Venezuela Agent.

16. Summers, by authorizing or allowing his subordinates to execute the bribery
schemes involving the vendors, caused Pride Foramer Venezuela to inaccurately record those
payments as payments for goods and services received from the vendors. Pride Foramer
Venezuela also falsely recorded the payments made to the Venezuela Intermediary through the
Venezuela Agent as marketing commission payments to the Venezuela Agent.

Payments to Collect Outstanding Receivables in Venezuela

17. Following widespread strikes and civil unrest in Venezuela in late 2002, Pride
Foramer Venezuela and other companies performing work for PDVSA had difficulty collecting
outstanding receivables from PDVSA. By early 2003, Pride Foramer Venezuela had significant
unpaid receivables for services that it had provided to PDVSA.

18. In or around March or April 2003, Pride Foramer Venezuela received information
that a mid-level PDVSA accounts payable employee was holding up the payment of funds owed
to Pride Foramer Venezuela and wanted a payment of approximately $30,000 in order to release
the funds due.

19. In or around March or April 2003, Summers authorized a payment of
approximately $30,000 to a third party, believing that all or a portion of the funds would be
offered or given by the third party to an employee of PDVSA for purposes of securing an
improper advantage in receiving payment from PDVSA. Shortly thereafter, in or around April
2003, Pride Foramer Venezuela received overdue payments from PDVSA for work that Pride

Foramer Venezuela had performed.
