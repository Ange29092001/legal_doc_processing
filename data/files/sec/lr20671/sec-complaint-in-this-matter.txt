COMPLAINT

. SUMMARY
1. This action involves violations of the issuer books and records provisions
of the federal securities laws arising from an embezzlement scheme at ABB Ltd.

at ABB Network Management (âABB NMâ), a division of a U.S. based ABB subsidiary,

networks. From 2002 through 2004, Defendant fraudulently submitted approximately
$468,714 in cash and check disbursement requests to ABB NM for fictional local
business expenses associated with projects in Brazil, Paraguay, and the United Arab
Emirates (âUAEâ). The funds disbursed by ABB NM as a result of these requests were
not used to pay business expenses, but rather were embezzled by Defendant and the ,

former General Manager of ABB NM.

Section 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ) and Exchange
Act Rule 13b2-1 [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78m(b)(5) and 17 C.F.R. Â§ 240.13b2-1], and aided and

abetted violations of Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§
78m(b)(2)(A)].-

described herein, Defendant made use of the mails and/or the means or instrumentalities
of interstate commerce.

DEFENDANT

4. Defendant Ali Hozhabri (âHozhabriâ), age 53, is a citizen of the United
States and currently resides in Houston, Texas. During the relevant time period,
Hozhabri was a project manager for ABB Network Management, a Sugarland, Texas
based division of ABB Inc., a U.S. subsidiary of ABB.

RELEVANT ENTITY

5. ABB Ltd., a Swiss corporation with headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland,
is a global provider of power and automation technologies. ABBâs American Depository
Receipts are registered with the Commission pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(b) [15
U.S.C. Â§ 781(b)], and trade on the New York Stock Exchange. As a foreign issuer, ABB
files annual reports with the Commission on Form 20-F. During the relevant time period,
ABB had numerous direct and indirect subsidiaries, including ABB Inc., whose financial

results were part of ABBâs consolidated financial statements filed with the Commission.

 
FACTS
The Embezzlement Scheme
6. Between 2002 and 2004, Defendant and the formet General Manager of
ABB NM, embezzled at least $468,714 from ABB NM. They carried out this scheme by
requesting and/or authorizing cash and check disbursements to pay purported business
expenses associated with contracts ABB NM was performing for Itaipu Binacional
(âITAIPUâ), an entity owned by the governments of Brazil and Paraguay, and for Abu
Dhabi Company for Onshore Oil Operations (âADCOâ), a division of a government
owned company in the UAE.

7, Defendant was ABB NMâs project manager on these contracts. The
$468,714 that ABB NM disbursed as a result of these fraudulent requests was never used
to pay any business expenses associated with these contracts, but rather was embezzled
by Defendant and the former ABB NM General Manager. Defendant personally kept
$234,357 of these embezzled funds, and ABB NMâs General Manager kept the remainder
of money.

The ITAIPU Contract

 

8. ITAIPU is an entity owned by the governments of Brazil and Paraguay
that generates and transmits power from a hydroelectric damn on the Parana River. In
2000, as a result of an acquisition by ABB, ABB NM assumed performance of a $6.9
million contract to provide products and services to ITAIPU. Between 2002 and 2004,
Defendant and the former General Manager of ABB NM, embezzled approximately

$330,000 in connection with the ITAIPU contract.

 
9. Under the ITAIPU contract, ABB NM was permitted to adjust previously
submitted invoices to ITAIPU to account for inflation according to a formula specified in
the contract. Defendant, the project manager on this contract, bypassed ABB NMâs
ordinary procedure of generating these invoices through the accounting department, and
personally prepared and submitted to ITAIPU, approximately $330,000 in âreadjustmentâ
invoices. After ITAIPU paid these invoices, Defendant prepared and submitted
fraudulent requests to ABB NM for cash and check disbursements to pay purported
business expenses associated with the ITAIPU contract. The expenses -- described on
the disbursement requests as âcommissionsâ and âlocal worksâ -- were phony. The
purported expenses were inaccurately recorded as legitimate business expenses in ABBâs
books and records.

10. The General Manager of ABB NM authorized ABB NMâs controller to
approve these disbursements, purportedly so Defendant could take cash to Brazil to pay
local business expenses of ABB NM associated with this project. These funds were not
used to pay business expenses. Instead, Defendant and the former ABB NM General
Manager kept the money for their personal use.

The ADCO Contract

11. ADCOisa division of Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (âADNOCâ), a
government owned company that, among other operations, generates and transmits
electrical power in the UAE. In 2000, as a result of an acquisition by ABB, ABB NM
assumed performance of a $5.9 million contract to provide products and services to

ADCO. Defendant was the project manager on this contract. In 2002 and 2003,

 
Defendant and the former General Manager of ABB NM, embezzled approximately
$139,000 in connection with the ADCO contract.

12. In 2002 and 2003, there were various change orders to the ADCO
contract, pursuant to which ABB NM provided ADCO additional products and services.
ABB NM, through an ABB subsidiary in Abu Dhabi, submitted invoices to ADCO in
connection with these change orders. After ADCO paid certain of these invoices,
Defendant prepared and submitted fraudulent requests to ABB NM for cash and check
disbursements to pay purported âcommissionsâ and âsubcontractor feesâ associated with
_ these change orders. These purported expenses, which were recorded as legitimate
business expenses in ABBâs books and records, were phony.

13. The General Manager authorized ABB NMâs controller to approve these
disbursements, purportedly so Defendant could take cash to Abu Dhabi to pay local
business expenses associated with these change orders. These funds were not used to pay
business expenses, rather Defendant and the former ABB NM General Manager kept the
money for their personal use.

FIRST CLAIM
(Books and Records and Internal Controls)
[Violations of Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) and Rule 13b2-1]

14. Paragraphs 1 through 13 are re-alleged and incorporated by reference.

accounting controls and, directly or indirectly, falsified, or caused to be falsified, books,

records, or accounts of ABB subject to Exchange Act Section 13(b)(2) [15 U.S.C. Â§

78m(b)(2)].
16. By reason of the foregoing, Defendant violated Exchange Act Section

[Aiding and Abetting Violations of Exchange Act Section 13(b)(2)(A)]

17. Paragraphs 1 through 16 are re-alleged and incorporated by reference.

inaccurately recorded as payment of legitimate business expenses in ABBâs consolidated
books and records, in violation of Exchange Act Section 13(b)(2)(A) [15 U.S.C. Â§
78m(b)(2)(A)]. Asa consequence, ABBâs books and records failed to accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the issuer. _

inaccurately record these disbursements and phony expenses in ABBâs books and
records.
