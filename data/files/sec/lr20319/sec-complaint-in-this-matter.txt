_ 1. . York International Corporation (âYork Internationalâ or the âCompanyâ),
_ and certain of its subsidiaries, violated the anti-bribery, books and records, and internal
controls p provisions of the F oreign Corupt Practices Act (the âF CPAâ) oy making illicit -
: payments to secure and maintain business opportunities v worldwide. |
2 : F rom 2000 to 2003, York Internationalâs Dubai subsidiary authorized and
: made approximately $647, 110 in kickback payments in connection with its sale of
humanitarian goods to Iraq under the United Nations Oil for Food Program (the
Programâ . Although the payments \ were characterized as âafter-sales service fees,â noÂ»

bona fide services were actually performed. The Program provided humanitarian relief to
the Iraqi population during the time that Iraq was subject to international trade sanctions.

Traq could only purchase necessary humanitarian goods and related services through a

. UN. escrow account. However, the kickbacks paid in connection with York
Internationalâs subsidiaryâs sale of goods to Iraq bypassed the escrow account and were
instead paid by a third party to Iraqi-vontrolled aÃ©counts in countries such as J ordan. âThe
company received apptoximately $931 ,318 in net iofits for the six transactions for | .
which it paid kickbacks. ve! | |

_3.. In 2003 and 2004, York International's Delaware subsidiary, York Air |

, Conditioning and Refrigeration, Ine. CYACRâ) paid aiiproximuitely $522,500 to an
intermediary while knowing that most of the money was intended to bribe United Arab
Emirate officials to secure contracts in connection with the construction of a
government-owned luxury hotel called the Conference Palace. These payments were
made to influence acts and decisions by the governmetit officials in awarding YACR =
lucrative contracts. Altogether, thirteen ct payments were made on this project,
ranging fromâ $1,700 to $320, 000, totaling approximately $550,000. The total amount of

. YACR sales revenue relating to orders on the project w was appfoximately $3.7 million.

| FACTS
| I | The United Nations Oil for Food Program

16. On August 2, 1990, the government of Iraq, under Saddam Hussein,

oe invaded Kuwait. F our-days later the United Nations Security Council voted to enact U:N: .

| : . Resolution 661, which prohibited member states. from: wading i in any Iraqi commodities
| . OF produets. âThe United Nations continu t âto cakes these sanctions vintil 2003. :
We On April 14, 1995, the United Nations SÃ©cmity Council adopted |
. Resolution 986, which authorized the Government of Iraq to sell oil on the condition that
the proceeds of all of its oil sales be deposited ina bank account monitored by the United

âNations and used only to purchase designated humanitarian goods for the benefit of the
Iraqi people. In May 1996, the Government of Iraq entered into a written Memorandum
of Understanding to implement Resohition 986. |

18. | The United Nations Office of Iraq Prograin, Oil for Food (the âOil for

- Food Programâ or âProgramâ) was subsequently established to administer Iraqâs sale of
oil and purchase of humanitarian goods by Iraq. A special bank account was established ~
at a bank in New York (the âUN Esctow Accountâ) t6 handle the transactions. The
United Nationsâ economic sanctions on Iraq remained in place for all trade and |
"transactions not authorized by the Oil for Food Program.

19, - Starting in the middle of 2000, the Iraqi government made a concerted :
effort to subvert the Program by demanding secret kickbacks from its humanitarian goods -
âsuppliers. âAlthough contracts entered into pursuant to the Program were subject to UN +
- review and approval, the Program gave Iraq discretion to select the companies from
which it purchased goods. âA humanitarian supplier would submit a bid for the sale of its:
âgoods. After the Iraqi ministry would accept the bid, the ministry would inform the
supplier of the requirement that the supplier pay a secret kickback in the form of an

âAfter-Sales Service Feeâ (âASSFâ) to fraqi in order to win the contract. The Iraqi

. ministry would also inform the supplier that the ASSF would have to be paid prior to the. oo

goods entering into the country, 0 or the. goods would be: stopped at the border until the
kickback was paid. | |

20. Initially when this scheme first began, suppliers met with the Tragi
ministries in person anid signed a. side agreement acknowledging. that the supplier would -

pay the kickback! By October 2000, this fee was usually ten percent of the total contract Â°

 

r "The side agreement was not t provided to the UN when the Oil for Food contract was submitted and
approved. âThis was in violations of the Program and U.S. and international trade sanctions against Iraq.
_ value. Later in the scheme, everyone understood that the ten percent would have to be
. paid, thus, side agreements -were no longer needed - the supplier would simply increase
its original contract bid by ten percent 7
21. The supplier would then submit its contract with the inflated contract price.
to the UN for approval, and:not disclose the ten percent kickback, which was in violations
of the Program rules. The supplier would vay the ASSF to Iraq prior to shipping its
- goods. Afterwards, the. UN: Escrow Account would pay the supplier the inflated conte -
price for the goods, thus, unknowingly reimbursing the supplier for the ten 1 pereent thatâ
the supplier had already kicked back to Iraq. AS a result of this conduct, the UN Escrow | |
. Account lost the benefit of $1 billion.

22. | After the United States invaded Iraq i in 1 March 2003, at the request of the oI
provisional govemment the UN ceased Iraqâs ASSE scheme. The UN required that allâ
pending contracts that had been inflated by ten percent be amended to reflect the true oe
contract value of the goods.

23. York F ZE began participating in thÃ©. Program in n approximately March
4 1999. It rÃ©tained a J ordan-based consillting firm to- act 2 as. its agent (âAgentâ) i in the / =
bididing = The retention agreement with the Agent at that time was-not formalized . : -
in writing. The consulting firm was headed by a well-connected Iraqi citizen who resided ;
in Jordan. With the Agentâ s assistance, York FZE: secured three contracts under the 7
| Program from March 1999 to April 2000: prior to ragâ s demand i for kickbacks.
24. Ono or about September 20, 2000, the: Agent notified York FZE that it had

been awarded its fourth contract under the Progratn. The contract was for the sale of ai air
conditioner compressors (the âCompressor Contractâ) to the Iraqi Ministry of Trade for
$1, 025, 800. However, shortly thereafter, the Agent informed York FZE that the Iraqi â
ministries had instituted anew policy requiring companies supplying humanitarian goods:
| under the Pro gram to pay an ASSF on each contract even though no after-sales services
would actually be. performed. ,
| 25. o Ta light of the n new Iraqi policy, the Agent advised YACRâs Middle Bast ,
- Regional Sales Manager (Regional Sales Managerâ) that the Minisity 0 of Trade chad
requested that York FZE i increase its bid-on the Compressor Contract at had just been a -
, awarded i in September by tn percent, In a November 7, 2000 memorandum to the. :
Regionel Sales Manager, who was based in YACRâs Dubai branch, the Agent asserted
that the Agent could facilitate the ârequested 10%â by. characterizing the payment asa |
| âperformance bond. â The Agent also. stated that the âYork Name will not be i in 1 the
middle for such agreement [sic}.â , Further, the Agent suggested that if York PZB did not |

sign the. contract including the ten percent kickback, it could adversely impact York |

oo FZEâs reputation and its ability to obtain future business under the Pro gram.

26. That same: e day, the Regional Sales: Manager responded. in. writing stating
= that York FZE only wanted to conduct business i in faq in! full compliance with UN rales

7: -and regulations. Fe or unrelated reasons, . the Regional. Sales Manager: shortly thereafter - oo
transferred. out of the office. Jn late November 2000, the Regional Sales Manager turned :

over his sesponsiilites to a Dubai-based YACR area manager (âArea Managerâ. On or
aboitt November 19 9 and 20, 2000, the Area Manager: and his supervisor, YACR Vice-

President and General Manager for. the Middle East ("Vice-Presiden %s met with the

Agent i in York FZEâs Dubai office. |
27. The Agent and York FZE agreed that the Agent would pay the ten percent
| kickback on York FZEâs behalf and that the Agentâ s commission would be increased to
- | âcover the payment. Onc or about November 19, 2000, the: Agent and âYork FZE
- memorialized the agreement to increase the Agentâ S. commission from. between 3 and 4%
Â° ~ to 13. 3%. âWhen York FZE submitted the contract to. the: UN, it âinflated its contract price
by ten. n percent The Agent submitted an inflated i invoice t6 York FZE, which included

âihe ten percent kickback it âpaid to the Ministry c of Trade on n behalf of York FZE. York

7 FZE paid the i invoice âknowing the ten percent was s kicked back to iraq on its behalf and

a described the âpayment z as a âconsultancyâ payment i in its books and records.

28. The Agent paid ASSFs on York FZEâs behalf for five additional contracts
urider the Progtam, Bor these contracts, York FZE submitted inflated bids to the relevant

- Tragi ministries. The Agent typically deposited the kickback payinents in Jordanian

- banks designated by the Tragi ministries. The kickback payment. had to be made prior to

âthe dÃ©ods being shipped to Iraq because Iraqi custom officials required proof of the
Kickback payment before the g00ds could enter the country. Therefore, the Agent made
the ASSF payment up front and âwas later reimbursed, when York FZE received a -
disbursement from the UN Escrow Account. - : |

a . Devise. Elaborate Schemes: to. Make HMlicit Consultancy Payments to Secure
Contracts â

30. York International, through its subsidiaries, made numerous illicit:

payments to secure orders on certain commercial andâ government projects in the Middle.
East and elsewhere. York Middle East personnel in both the Dubai and Abu Dhabi
branches of YACR devised an elaborate scheme to conceal kickback payments to certain
- individuals who could influence their customers, such-as construction companies or other
end-users, to choose York products for their particular project, These payments, which
-. York Middle East internally referred to as âconsultancy fees,â were made to a variety of 7
ârecipients, including (1) employees of the end-user; 2) Ã©imployees of technical

"engineering firms retainedâ by end-users to provide design services; (3) employees. of

cos : contractors retained by, the end-users to camry out construction; (4) employees of technical oe

, engineering firms retained by contractors or other parties: ; and (5) contractor firms. ,
-.31. These consultancy payments Srere similar to the ASSF payments York
FZE paid under the Oil for Food Program because no bona fide consulting services were â
actually perforined and the payments. were made to secure contracts. |
A. The Mechanics of the Scheme :
32. York International subsidiaries tised a number of different mechanisms to
funnel money to persons with authority to impact or secure business for. the company.

One mechanism involved the payment of cash, F or example, in the UAE, complicit sales. -

oe me people employed by YACRâs Dubai and Abu Dhabi branches arranged for. purported.

- contractors to generate and. submit bogus in invoices to 0 York Middle East. for â âconsulting
servicesâ that the contractors had not actually performed. Fither the Dubai or Abu Dhabi :
. branch, depending on the location of the project, paid thei invoices. Afterwards, the
purported contractor gave an equal amount of cash to the branch sales people tess a sinall
fee. The sales people then used the-cash to pay customer-affiliated individuals to secure

âcontracts.

10
33. A second mechanism involved either the Dubai or Abu Dhabi branch of â
YACR directly wiring or sending a check for payment to-entities designated by customer
employees based on false invoices for purported âconsulting services.â

34. A third mechanism used in other countties in the region, such as Eeypt â
Turkey and Bahrain, involved sales people (generally employees of the local: York

entity) arranging direct York F ZE. payments to be paid to consulting firms or contractors.

. designated bye customers. âThese payments were described as. being for services rendered, a

, by these consultants and conÃ©raÃ©tors in- changing design specifications so that they would: -
, be more favorable to York International.

B. Bribes Paid to UAE Officials for the Conference Palace Project

35. The Conference Palace i isa major hotel and convention complex built and

_ owned by the government of Abu Dhabi, UAE.. In 2003 and 2004, the Dubai-based Area ..

Manager who had a role in approving kickback payments under the Oil for Food Program

agreed to make payments, through an. intermediary (âIntermediaryâ) to UAE government mo

officials who had been appointed as members of the Conference Palace Hotel Executive .

-- Committee (the âCommitteeâ ). The Committee was established by a, government Â¢ decree, te

and the members of: the Committee v were appointed by. the Crown Prince of. Abu Dhabi.

ihe Ministryâ s direction and control. The Coinmitte had authority to make decisions on. â

~ awarding contracts to suppliers, such as YACR. |

36. : In March. 2003, the Area Manager directed the Abu Dhabi branch to make oe

- the first payment in connection with this project toa United Arab Emirates consulting |

| firm which employed t the Intermediary. The Area a Manager later arranged for twelve â

11
additional payments in connection with this project. In each case, the paymenits were
facilitated by local contractors or a distributor who agreed to submit false invoices to
: York Middle East. Once the invoices were paid, either a York Middle Bast salesman ot |
sales manager retrieved the cash from each contractor, often times: less a smal âfee, and |
passed it on to: the âArea Manager who then passed it on-to. the Intermediary for payment
to the Committee members. The Vice President (who approved the kickbacks under the
-Oil for Food Program) and YACRâs Dubai-based director of finance âF jnance Directorâ) -
also approved these payments. - | | a |

from $1, 700. to $320, 000, totaling approximately $550,000. âApproximately $522, 500 â
âwas given to the intermediary while knowing that n most of 1 it was intended to bribe
members of the Committee. The total amount of York Middle East sales revenme relating
to orders for the Conference Palace project was approximately $3.7 million.

Abu Dhabi branch sales manager arranged fora local contractor: (xo facilitated

. payments in connection witha another * project) to issue a false i invoice to York Middle East
| âfe approximately $2, 000. âAfter receiving the i invoice, the Abu Dhabi branch sent the
local contractor a. cheek for approximately $2000. The local contractor then gave the

| sales manager approximately $1,900 i in cash. The sales manager gave âthe $1,900 to an

12
eimployee of an engineering firm, which the end-user had retained on the project. In turn,
the employee of the engineering firm prepared design specifications that favored York
âeqitipment to ensure York would win the contract. York then secured the contract.
