Bureau Findings and Conclusions

The Bureau finds the following:

Respondent is a residential-mortgage servicer located in Highlands Ranch,
Colorado. As of February 29, 2020, Respondent serviced a portfolio of
mortgage loans worth about $112.69 billion.

Respondent is a âcovered personâ as defined by 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(6) and a
âservicerâ as defined by 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1024.2(b) because, among other things,
it services loans and is responsible for servicing federally related mortgage

loans within the meaning of 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1024.2(b).
Findings and Conclusions
as to Respondentâs Prohibited Foreclosure Actions

Regulation X generally protects a borrower who has submitted a facially
complete or complete Loss-Mitigation Application from certain foreclosure
activities from the date the borrower submits a facially complete or complete
Loss-Mitigation Application through specific end dates. For facially
complete Loss-Mitigation Applications, foreclosure protections continue
through the period in which the borrower is given a reasonable opportunity
to provide the additional information or documents necessary to complete
the Loss-Mitigation Application. For complete Loss-Mitigation
Applications, including those that are facially complete and become
complete, foreclosure protections continue until the determination of
whether an alternative to foreclosure is viable and while the parties are
working toward such an alternative, unless one of the circumstances
specified in 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1024.41(Â£)(2) or (g) is met.
During this period, Regulation X prohibits a servicer from:
a. making the First Filing, if the borrower submits the complete Loss-
Mitigation Application before the servicer making the First Filing;
b. Moving for Judgment, if the borrower submits the complete Loss-
Mitigation Application after the servicer made the First Filing but

more than 37 days before a foreclosure sale; and
8.

10.

C. conducting a foreclosure sale, if the borrower submits the complete
Loss-Mitigation Application after the servicer made the First Filing
but more than 37 days before a foreclosure sale. 12 C.F.R. Â§
1024.41(f)(2), (g).

Regulation X requires these foreclosure protections to remain in place until:

a. the servicer sends an Evaluation Notice advising the borrower that he
or she is not eligible for any Loss-Mitigation Options and the appeal
period in 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1024.41(h) is not applicable, the borrower has
not requested an appeal within the applicable period for requesting an
appeal, or the borrowerâs appeal has been denied;

b. the borrower rejects all Loss-Mitigation Options offered by the
servicer; or

C. the borrower fails to perform under an agreement on a Loss-
Mitigation Option. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1024.41(f)(2)(i)-(iil), (g)(1)-(3).

These protections apply to all complete Loss-Mitigation Applications,

regardless of whether the borrower indicated a preference for a Loss-

Mitigation Option that allows him or her to retain the home.

Since January 10, 2014, Respondent made First Filings, moved for

foreclosure judgment or an order of sale, and conducted foreclosure sales in
11.

12.

13.

14.

certain instances where the borrower was entitled to protection from these
actions under Regulation X. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1024.41(f)(2), (g).

Respondent therefore violated RESPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§ 2601 et seq., and its
implementing regulation, Regulation X, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1024.41(f)(2), (g), by
making First Filings, moving for foreclosure judgments or orders for sale,
and conducting foreclosure sales when the borrower was entitled to
protection from those actions. These violations are also violations of the
CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(A), because they reflect an act or omission
committed in violation of a Federal consumer financial law.

Findings and Conclusions as to Respondentâs
Failures to Send or Timely Send Evaluation Notices

Regulation X requires servicers, within 30 days of receiving a complete
Loss-Mitigation Application from a borrower, to evaluate the borrower for
all available loss-mitigation options and to give the borrower an Evaluation
Notice regarding those options. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1024.41(c)(1).

Since January 10, 2014, Respondent failed to send or timely send Evaluation
Notices to certain borrowers who were entitled to Evaluation Notices under
Regulation X. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1024.41(c)(1)(ii).

Respondent therefore violated RESPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§ 2601 et seq., and its

implementing regulation, Regulation X, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1024.41(c)(1)(qi), and
15.

2020-BCFP-0002 Document1 Filed 05/11/2020 Page 10 of 32

also the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(A), by committing an act or
omission in violation of a Federal consumer financial law.

the following affirmative actions:

a. develop and implement policies and procedures that ensure borrowers

violations of law described in Section IV of this Consent Order, and taking
into account the factors in 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5565(c)(3), Respondent must pay a
civil money penalty of $250,000 to the Bureau.
Within 10 days of the Effective Date, Respondent must pay the civil money
penalty by wire transfer to the Bureau or to the Bureauâs agent in compliance

12 U.S.C. Â§ 5497(d).
Respondent must treat the civil money penalty paid under this Consent Order
as a penalty paid to the government for all purposes. Regardless of how the
Bureau ultimately uses those funds, Respondent may not:
claim, assert, or apply for a tax deduction, tax credit, or any other tax
benefit for any civil money penalty paid under this Consent Order;
seek or accept, directly or indirectly, reimbursement or
indemnification from any source, including but not limited to payment
made under any insurance policy, with regard to any civil money

penalty paid under this Consent Order.

To preserve the deterrent effect of the civil money penalty, in any Related
Consumer Action, Respondent may not argue that Respondent is entitled to,
nor may Respondent benefit by, any offset or reduction of any compensatory
monetary remedies imposed in the Related Consumer Action because of the
civil money penalty paid in this action or because of any payment that the
Bureau makes from the Civil Penalty Fund. Ifthe court in any Related
Consumer Action offsets or otherwise reduces the amount of compensatory
monetary remedies imposed against Respondent based on the civil money
penalty paid in this action or based on any payment that the Bureau makes
from the Civil Penalty Fund, Respondent must, within 30 days after entry of
a final order granting such offset or reduction, notify the Bureau and pay the
amount of the offset reduction to the U.S. Treasury. Such a payment will not
be considered an additional civil money penalty and will not change the
amount of the civil money penalty imposed in this action.

IX.
Additional Monetary Provisions

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that:
In the event of any default on Respondentâs obligations to make payment
under this Consent Order, interest, computed under 28 U.S.C. 8 1961, as

Respondent must relinquish all dominion, control, and title to the funds paid

returned to Respondent.

Under 31 U.S.C. Â§ 7701, Respondent, unless it already has done so, must
furnish to the Bureau its taxpayer-identification numbers, which may be
used for purposes of collecting and reporting on any delinquent amount
