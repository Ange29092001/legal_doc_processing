Overview
PHLoans is a mortgage broker and lender that offers and provides mortgages
guaranteed by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).
Occasionally, it has acted as the creditor, providing loans itself; in other
situations, it has acted as a broker, arranging for another creditor to provide
loans.
PHLoans advertises these mortgage products to consumers through direct-
mail advertising campaigns targeted primarily at United States military
servicemembers and veterans.
PHLoans has sent consumers millions of advertisements that violate federal
law because of misleading and deceptive statements and inadequate
disclosures.
The Bureau brings this action to stop PHLoans from distributing
advertisements with misleading and deceptive statements and inadequate
disclosures to servicemembers, veterans, and other consumers.

PHLoans offers consumer mortgages, including mortgages guaranteed by
the VA.

PHLoansâs principal means of advertising VA-guaranteed mortgages is
through direct-mail advertisements sent to consumers, including veterans
and servicemembers.

Since July 2016, PHLoans has mailed millions of mortgage advertisements

to consumers in at least 13 states.

False, Misleading, and Inaccurate Representations

Federal consumer financial law contains numerous provisions banning the
use of misleading and deceptive statements in mortgage advertisements.
Despite those prohibitions, PHLoans was responsible for both the content of,
and the dissemination of, numerous mortgage advertisements during the
Relevant Period that contained false, misleading, and inaccurate statements,
as described below.

False, Misleading, and Inaccurate
Representations About Cost and Other Credit Terms

Most of PHLoansâs mortgage advertisements stated specific credit terms,
such as an interest rate or a payment amount.
By stating specific credit terms in its advertisements, PHLoans represented,

expressly or by implication, that it arranged or offered a mortgage with those
24.

credit terms.

In fact, PHLoans did not arrange or offer mortgages with the specific credit
terms stated in many of those advertisements.

In numerous instances, PHLoans misrepresented the actual credit terms
applicable to the mortgages that it would arrange or offer.

Numerous PHLoans mortgage advertisements misrepresented the payment
amount applicable to the advertised mortgage or the existence, nature, or
amount of cash available to the consumer in connection with the advertised
mortgage.

For example, PHLoans advertisements sent to 25 consumers from May 2018
through July 2018 stated that the consumer could âTakeâ a $20,000 cash-out
amount for âONLY $95.68 PER MONTH.â In fact, PHLoans did not offer a
product with those terms. A cash-out amount was only available if the
consumer had an existing mortgage and refinanced the entire amount owed
on that mortgage as part of a cash-out refinance mortgage loan obtained from
PHLoans, resulting in a total monthly payment greater than $95.68.
Numerous PHLoans mortgage advertisements misrepresented the existence
and amount of fees or costs to the consumer.

Specifically, PHLoans advertisements sent to around 26,000 consumers from

October 2016 to November 2016 stated âNo Out of Pocket Expenses.â

All VA loans have closing costs. But for at least one of the products featured
in these advertisements, consumers would need to directly pay out-of-pocket
expenses at closing. Accordingly, in connection with the loan that PHLoans
was advertising, the statement âNo Out of Pocket Expensesâ was false.
Consumers who received the advertisements described in Paragraphs 26 to
30 were likely to be misled by them.
The advertisements were also likely to affect consumersâ conduct or
decisions with regard to obtaining a loan.

Inadequate Disclosures
Many of PHLoansâs mortgage advertisements stated a payment amount or a
simple annual rate of interest. Under certain sections of Regulation Z,
including Â§ 1026.24(d) and (f), the use of these terms triggers specific
disclosure requirements. Many of the advertisements did not include the
other disclosures that are required, or did not include them in the manner
required.
For example, numerous PHLoans mortgage advertisements stated a payment
amount, but failed to state the terms of repayment reflecting the consumerâs
repayment obligations over the full term of the loan.
Specifically, PHLoans advertisements for a variable-rate mortgage sent to

around 26,000 consumers from October 2016 to November 2016 stated a
36.

monthly payment amount of $1,394 that applied to the 3-year fixed rate
period of the loan. After the first three years, the rate was adjustable by as
much as 1% per year with a lifetime cap of 5%. While higher monthly
payments would likely apply to the variable rate period of the loan, the
advertisements did not state the amounts of those payments.

Numerous PHLoans mortgage advertisements stated a simple annual rate of
interest for a loan for which more than one interest rate would apply, but
failed to state, for variable-rate transactions, a rate determined by adding an
index and margin, based on a reasonably current index and margin.

For example, PHLoans advertisements for a variable-rate mortgage sent to
over 154,000 consumers in 2017 stated a simple annual rate of interest that
applied to the fixed-rate period of the loan (such as the first five years), but
for the variable-rate period of the loan, failed to state a rate determined by
adding a reasonably current index and margin.

Numerous PHLoans mortgage advertisements stated a payment amount, but
failed to state the amount of each payment that would apply over the term of
the loan (e.g., for adjustable-rate mortgages, payments based on the
application of the sum of a reasonably current index and margin); or failed to
state clearly and conspicuously that the actual payment obligation would be

greater.

2020-BCFP-0009 Document1 Filed 08/26/2020 Page 11 of 39

For example, PHLoans advertisements for a variable-rate mortgage sent to
around 39,214 consumers in 2017 stated a payment amount that was based
on an introductory, discount rate that applied only to the fixed-rate period of
the loan. That payment was not calculated based on the index and margin
that would be used to make subsequent payment adjustments over the
remaining term of the loan, and the advertisements failed to state such a
payment amount.

In addition, PHLoans advertisements sent to around 50,900 consumers in
2017 stated a payment amount, but failed to state, clearly and conspicuously,
that the actual payment obligation would be greater.

VIOLATIONS OF REGULATION Z
Unavailable Credit Terms, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(a)

Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(a), â[i]f an advertisement for credit states
specific credit terms, it shall state only those terms that actually are or will
be arranged or offered by the creditor.â

PHLoans violated Â§ 1026.24(a) because, as described in Paragraphs 22-30,
numerous PHLoans advertisements for credit stated specific credit terms
other than those terms that actually were or would be arranged or offered by

the creditor.

Terms of Repayment, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(d)

Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(d)(1), if an advertisement sets forth any of the
four specified triggering terms (the amount or percentage of any
downpayment, the number of payments or period of repayment, the amount
of any payment, or the amount of any finance charge), the advertisement
must also state, among other things, â[t|he terms of repayment, which reflect
the repayment obligations over the full term of the loan, including any
balloon payment.â 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(d)(1), (2)(11).

PHLoans violated Â§ 1026.24(d) because, as described in Paragraphs 27 and
34-35, numerous PHLoans mortgage advertisements set forth the period of
repayment, which is a triggering term under Â§ 1026.24(d)(1)(i1), but failed to
state the repayment obligations over the full term of the loan, pursuant to Â§

1026.24(d)(2)(i1).
Inadequate Disclosure of Rates, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(f)(2)(i)

Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(f)(2)(i), if'a direct-mail mortgage advertisement:

states a simple annual rate of interest and more than one
simple annual rate of interest will apply over the term of the
advertised loan, the advertisement shall disclose in a clear and
conspicuous manner:

(A) Each simple annual rate of interest that will apply.
In variable-rate transactions, a rate determined by
adding an index and margin shall be disclosed based on

a reasonably current index and margin;

(B) The period of time during which each simple

(C) The [APR] for the loan. If such rate is variable, the
[APR] shall comply with the accuracy standards in
Â§Â§ 1026.17(c) and 1026.22.

46. PHLoans violated Â§ 1026.24(f)(2)(1) because, as described in Paragraphs 36-
37, numerous PHLoans direct-mail mortgage advertisements for a loan for
which more than one interest rate would apply stated a simple annual rate of
interest but did not include one or more of the disclosures required pursuant

to Â§ 1026.24(f)(2)(i)(A) through (C), or did not disclose them clearly and

conspicuously, as defined in Â§ 1026.24(f)(2)(i1).
Inadequate Disclosure of Payment Terms, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(f)(3)(@)

47. Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(f)(3 )(1), a direct-mail mortgage advertisement
that âstates the amount of any paymentâ must disclose, in a clear and
conspicuous manner:

(A) The amount of each payment that will apply over the term
of the loan, including any balloon payment. In variable-rate
transactions, payments that will be determined based on the
application of the sum of an index and margin shall be

disclosed based on a reasonably current index and margin;

(B) The period of time during which each payment will apply;
and

(C) In an advertisement for credit secured by a first lien on a

dwelling, the fact that the payments do not include amounts

for taxes and insurance premiums, if applicable, and that the

actual payment obligation will be greater.
PHLoans violated Â§ 1026.24(f)(3)() because, as described in Paragraphs 38-
40 numerous PHLoans direct-mail mortgage advertisements stated the
amount of a payment but did not include one or more of the disclosures
required pursuant to Â§ 1026.24(f)(3)G)(A) through (C), or did not disclose
them clearly and conspicuously, as defined in Â§ 1026.24(f)(3)(i1).

VIOLATIONS OF THE MAP RULE (REGULATION N)

Misrepresentations About Fees or Costs, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.3(c)

Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.3(c), it is a violation for any person subject to the
MAP Rule to make any misrepresentation, directly or indirectly, expressly
or by implication, in any commercial communication, about â[t|he existence,
nature, or amount of fees or costs to the consumer associated with the
mortgage credit product, including but not limited to misrepresentations that
no fees are charged.â Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.3, such a misrepresentation is
specifically prohibited and is therefore material.

PHLoans violated Â§ 1014.3(c) because, as described in Paragraphs 28-30,
numerous PHLoans mortgage advertisements contained misrepresentations
about the existence, nature, or amount of fees or costs to the consumer

associated with a mortgage credit product.

Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.3q), it is a violation for any person subject to the
MAP Rule to make any misrepresentation, directly or indirectly, expressly
or by implication, in any commercial communication, about â[t]he existence,
nature, or amount of cash or credit available to the consumer in connection
with the mortgage credit product, including but not limited to
misrepresentations that the consumer will receive a certain amount of cash

such a misrepresentation is specifically prohibited and is therefore material.
PHLoans violated Â§ 1014.3(j) because, as described in Paragraphs 26-27,
numerous PHLoans mortgage advertisements contained misrepresentations

number, amount, or timing of any minimum or required payments, including

but not limited to misrepresentations about any payments or that no

payments are required in a reverse mortgage or other mortgage credit
product.â Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.3, such a misrepresentation is specifically
prohibited and is therefore material.

PHLoans violated Â§ 1014.3(k) because, as described in Paragraphs 26-27,
numerous PHLoans mortgage advertisements contained misrepresentations
about the payments that would be required in connection with the advertised
mortgage credit product.

VIOLATIONS OF THE CFPA

Under the CFPA, it is unlawful for any covered person or service provider to
engage in a deceptive act or practice in connection with any transaction with
a consumer for a consumer-financial product or service, or the offering of a
consumer-financial product or service. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).
An act or practice is deceptive if it involves a material misrepresentation or
omission that is likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under the
circumstances.

Information that is likely to affect a consumerâs choice of, or conduct

regarding, a product or service is material to consumers.

Deceptive Representations About Credit Terms
In numerous instances, as described in Paragraphs 22-32, PHLoansâs

mortgage advertisements represented, expressly or by implication, that
59.

specific credit terms were available or would be arranged or offered by the
creditor, including representations about payment amounts and loan costs,
when in fact those specific credit terms were not available or were not terms
that PHLoans was actually prepared to arrange or offer.

PHLoansâs misrepresentations about the availability of the advertised credit
terms of the advertised mortgage were likely to mislead consumers acting
reasonably under the circumstances.

PHLoansâs misrepresentations about the credit terms of the advertised
mortgage were material because they were likely to affect the conduct or

decisions of consumers.

Therefore, PHLoans engaged in deceptive acts and practices in violation of
the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).

Violations of the CFPA Based on Violations of
Regulation Z and the MAP Rule

Under the CFPA, a covered personâs violation of a Federal consumer
financial law, which includes enumerated consumer laws and rules

thereunder, violates the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. 88 5536(a)(1)(A), 5481(14).

Regulation Z and the MAP Rule are Federal consumer financial laws.

compliant with TILA, Regulation Z, the MAP Rule, the CFPA, and
this Consent Order. This review must encompass any envelope or

review an Exemplar of those advertisementsâincluding any
envelope, mailer, and enclosuresâto ensure that it is compliant with
TILA, Regulation Z, the MAP Rule, the CFPA, and this Consent

The Respondent must make the following payments by wire transfer to the
Bureau or the Bureauâs agent, in compliance with the Bureauâs wiring
instructions, to satisfy the penalty described in Paragraph 71. Within 10 days

12 U.S.C. Â§ 5497(d).
Respondent, for all purposes, must treat the civil money penalty paid under

the Bureau ultimately uses those funds, Respondent may not:
a. Claim, assert, or apply for a tax deduction, tax credit, or any other tax
benefit for any civil money penalty paid under this Consent Order; or

To preserve the deterrent effect of the civil money penalty in any Related
Consumer Action, Respondent may not argue that Respondent is entitled to,
nor may Respondent benefit by, any offset or reduction of any compensatory
monetary remedies imposed in the Related Consumer Action because of the
civil money penalty paid in this action or because of any payment that the
Bureau makes from the Civil Penalty Fund. If the court in any Related
Consumer Action offsets or otherwise reduces the amount of compensatory
monetary remedies imposed against Respondent based on the civil money
penalty paid in this action or based on any payment that the Bureau makes
from the Civil Penalty Fund, Respondent must, within 30 days after entry of
a final order granting such offset or reduction, notify the Bureau, and pay the
amount of the offset or reduction to the U.S. Treasury. Such a payment will
not be considered an additional civil money penalty and will not change the
amount of the civil money penalty imposed in this action.

Additional Monetary Provisions

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that:
In the event of any default on Respondentâs obligations to make payment
under this Consent Order, interest, computed under 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1961, as

returned to Respondent.

Under 31 U.S.C. Â§ 7701, Respondent, unless it already has done so, must
furnish to the Bureau its taxpayer-identification numbers, which may be used
for purposes of collecting and reporting on any delinquent amount arising out
of this Consent Order.

Within 30 days of the entry of a final judgment, consent order, or settlement
in a Related Consumer Action, Respondent must notify the Enforcement
Director of the final judgment, consent order, or settlement in writing. That
