Discover Bank, the Student Loan Corporation, and Discover Products,
Inc. each service student loans. Servicing loans is a âfinancial product
or serviceâ within the meaning of 12 U.S.C. $ 548 1C15)(A\G), and
thus is a âconsumer financial product or serviceâ under 12 U.S.C. Â§
S48 105 )(A).

Discover Bank, The Student Loan Corporation, and Discover
Products, Inc. each are a âcovered personâ under 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(6)
because they are each engaged in the offering or providing of a

CFPA; and (4) Respondent violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices
Act, IS U.S.C. Â§ 1692, et seq., through its collection activities on
certain defaulted student loans.

Approximately two years after the 2015 Consent Order was issued, in
September 2017, Respondent began the migration of its student loan
servicing platform to anew system.

Respondent migrated approximately 1.5 million loans for
approximately 778,000 borrowers to the new system during the
Migration.

The Migration resulted in hundreds of Migration Issues that harmed
tens of thousands of consumers andresulted in numerous Consent
Order Violations.

In September 2017, the Bureau examined Respondent to assess
Respondent's compliance with the 2015 Consent Order.

Respondent knew shortly after the Migration that many Migration
Issues were leading to potential Consent Order Violations.

Although Respondent was aware of potential Consent Order
Violations arising from the Migration while Bureau examiners were

on-site examining Respondentâs compliance with the 2015 Consent

Order, Respondent did not report these violations to the Bureau at that
time.
While Bureau examiners were on-site, Respondent was also aware of
other potential Consent Order Violations that occurred before the
Bureauâs examination that were unrelated to the Migration.
Respondent did not report these potential pre-Migration Consent
Order Violations tothe Bureau while Bureau examiners were on-site.
Respondentâs representations to the Bureau during the examination
about its compliance with the 2015 Consent Order were incomplete
and misleading.

Respondent violated the 2015 Consent Order as described herein.
Each ofits violations of the 2015 Consent Order constitutes a
violation of Section 5536(a)(1)(A) of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§
5536(a)(1)(A).

Misrepresentations of the Minimum Periodic Payment

 

Paragraph 49(b)(1) of the 2015 Consent Order states that Respondent
âmay not misrepresent. .. the minimum periodic payment owed by
consumers|.]â

While the 2015 Consent Order was in effect, Respondent made
misrepresentations to more than 100,000 consumers about the
minimum periodic paymentthese consumers owed. Respondent made
these misrepresentations in mailed account statements, letters, online,
and on phonecalls.

Most ofthese misrepresentations occurred as a result of the Migration.
In these communications, Respondent either overstated or understated
the minimum periodic payment owed by consumers.

Consumers were harmed by Respondentâs misrepresentations of the
minimum periodic payment owed, resulting in some consumers

paying more or less than the correct monthly amount, andsome

2020-BCFP-0026 Document1 Filed 12/22/2020 Page 10 of 54

consumers may have become late or delinquent because they could
not pay the amount they believed was the minimum amount due.
Respondentâs numerous misrepresentations of the minimum periodic
payment due from consumers violate Paragraph 49(b)(1) of the 2015
Consent Order, and thus also violate Section 5536(a)(1)(A) ofthe
CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(A).

Misrepresentations of the Amount of Interest Paid

 

Paragraph 49(b)(i1) of the 2015 Consent Order states that Respondent
âmay not misrepresent... the amount of interest paid by
consumers|.]â

The tax code allows student loan interest, up to $2,500, to be deducted
as an adjustment to income for some taxpayers.

While the Consent Order was in effect, Respondent misrepresented to
more than 8,000 consumers the amount of interest they had paid in
1098E tax forms, letters, online, or over the phone.

Most ofthese misrepresentations occurred as a result of the Migration.
In the misrepresentations, Respondent either overstated or understated
the amount of interest paid by consumers.

Respondent misrepresented the amount of interest consumers had paid

by amounts ranging from less than $100 to more than $40,000, and

10
33.

34.

35.

36.

37.

2020-BCFP-0026 Document1 Filed 12/22/2020 Page 11 of 54

which could have impacted consumersâ student loan interest
deductions by as much as $2,500.

By misrepresenting the am ount of interest consumers paid,
Respondent may have caused consumers to claim an inaccurate
student loan interest deduction, which could lead to financial harm,
including causing consumers not to claim their allowable deduction,
not to claim their maximum allowable deduction, or to chooseto refile
their taxes.

Respondentâs numerous misrepresentations of the amount of interest
paid by consumers violate Paragraph 49(b)(11) of the 2015 Consent
Order, and thus also violate Section 5536(a)(1)(A) ofthe CFPA, 12
U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(A).

Misrepresentations of Other Material Facts

 

Paragraph 49(b)(ii1) of the 2015 Consent Order states that Respondent
âmay not misrepresent... any other fact material to consumers
concerning the servicing of theirloans.â

While the 2015 Consent Order was in effect, Respondent
misrepresented multiple other facts material to the terms and servicing
of consumersâ student loans to more than 390,000 consumers.

Most of these misrepresentations occurred as a result of the Migration.

11
38.

39.

40.

2020-BCFP-0026 Document1 Filed 12/22/2020 Page 12 of 54

These misrepresentations to consumers were material because they
related to important facts about consumersâ loans that could influence
consumersâ decisions about their loans. For example, Respondent
misrepresented (a) the amount of interest some consumers owed due
to charging incorrect interest rates or incorrectly capitalizing interest,
(b) the applicable interest rate, (c) how payments would be allocated
by failing to properly apply consumersâ payments, (d) the due date,
amount due, or whether a payment was past due, (e) repayment
information, and (f) the availability of a reward or a discount, among
other things.

Respondentâs numerous misrepresentations of material facts violate
Paragraph 49(b)(1i1) of the 2015 Consent Order, and thus also violate
Section 5536(a)(1)(A) of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(A).

Failure to Pay Redress Required by 2015 Consent Order

 

Paragraph 58(c) of the 2015 Consent Order requires Respondent to
remediate consumers to whom it placed six or more attempted calls or
contacts before 8 a.m. or after 9 p.m. in the time zone where the

consumer resides.

Respondent improperly excluded consumers it had called between
January 29, 2014 and July 21, 2015 from the population of consumers
it remediated.

Respondent initially failed to remediate up to 777 consumers owed
money under the 2015 Consent Order.

Respondent later rem ediated these consumers, more than two years
after the 2015 Consent Order was issued, after the Bureau questioned
Respondent about its failure to remediate this population.

By failing to provide this remediation until more than two years after
the 2015 Consent Order was issued, Respondent violated Paragraph
58(c) of the 2015 Consent Order, and thus violated of Section
5536(a)(1)(A) of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(A).

Deceptive Acts and Practices

Section 1036(a)(1)(B) of the CFPA prohibits âunfair, deceptive, or
abusiveâ acts or practices. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(B).

Misrepresentations of the Minimum Periodic Payment

 

As described in paragraphs 21 through 26, Respondentâs numerous
misrepresentations of the minimum periodic payment owed by

consumers constitute deceptive acts or practices in violation of

13
47.

48.

2020-BCFP-0026 Document1 Filed 12/22/2020 Page 14 of 54

Sections 1031(a) and 1036(a)(1)(B) ofthe CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§
5531(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).

Misrepresentations of the Amount of Interest Paid

 

As described in paragraphs 27 through 34, Respondentâs numerous
misrepresentations of the amount of interest paid by consumers
constitute deceptive acts or practices in violation of Sections 103 1(a)

and 1036(a)(1)(B) of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531 (a), 5536(a)(1)(B).

Unfair Acts and Practices

As aresult of the Migration, which began in September 2017,
Respondent withdrew automatic payments from more than 17,000
consumersâ bank accounts without proper authorization.
Respondentâs actions included:

a. In some instances, Respondent withdrew automatic payment
amounts that were higherthan the amounts specified in
consumersâ billing statements;

b. â In some instances, Respondent withdrew unauthorized
automatic payments without providing notice to consumers in
advance; and

C. In some instances, Respondent withdrew the same automatic

paymenttwice.

As aresult of Respondentâs actions described in paragraph 48,
consumers were deprived the use of their funds and may have
incurred NSF and overdratt charges or other fees.

In addition, for more than 14,000 consumers, Respondent cancelled,
or failed to withdraw, automatic payments without providing notice to
consumers.

As aresult of Respondentâs actions described in paragraph 50,
Respondent incorrectly placed some of the 14,000 consumers in a
delinquency status, caused some consumersâ loans to accrue excess
interest, and deprived consumers of certain interest rate benefits.
Section 1036(a)(1)(B) ofthe CFPA prohibits âunfair, deceptive, or
abusiveâ acts or practices. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)B). An act or
practice 1s unfair if it causes or is likely to cause consumers
substantial injury that is not reasonably avoidable and ifthe
substantial injury is not outweighed by countervailing benefits to
consumers orto competition.

Respondentâs practice of withdrawing automatic payments from
consumersâ accounts without a valid authorization and cancelling or
failing to withdraw automatic payments without providing noticeto

consumers caused substantial injury to consumers that was not

15

reasonably avoidable or outweighed by any countervailing benefit to

34. Thus, Respondent engaged in untair acts and practices mn violation of
Sections 1036(ay1)(B) and LO3 l(c LoftheCPPA. 12 U.S.C. $$
5536(ay 1B), 553 1(c\I).

Violations of EF TA and Regulation E

55. The automatic payments described in paragraphs 48 to 51 above are
known as electronic funds transfers (EFTs) under the Electronic Fund
Transter Act (EFTA), 15 U.S.C. $ 1693, ef seq.

56. EPTA, 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1693e(a), and its implementing Regulation EH, 12
C.P.R. Â§ 1005.10(b), require preauthorized EFTs from a consumerâs

account to be authonzed in writing.

fF3
~]

As described in paragraphs 48 to 51, im many instances Respondent
withdrew preauthorized EFTs from consumersâ accounts without a
valid authorization, including by withdrawing amounts that were
higher than authorized or withdrawing the same payment twice.

58. EFTA, 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1693e(b), and its implementing Regulation E, 12
CFR. Â§ 1005.10(d), require a financial institution or designated
payee to provide a consumer with notice at least ten days in advance

of any automatic withdrawal that varies from the previous payment or

16
59.

60.

61.

62.

63.

from the preauthorized amount, unless the consumer has opted out of
the notice for a specified range of payment amounts.

Although consumers authorized preauthorized EFTs, many ofthe
withdrawals at issue varied from what consumers authorized,
Respondent failed to provide advance notice of the varying amounts,
and many consumers did not opt out of such notice. Other
withdrawals were duplicative of withdrawals Respondent had already
made, and thus not authorized.

Respondent therefore violated Regulation E, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1005.10(b)
and (d).

Respondentâs LI'TA Violations are Violations ofthe CEPA
Section 1036(a)(1)(A) ofthe CFPA makes it unlawful for covered
persons, such as Respondent, to âcommit any act or omission in
violation ofa Federal consumer financial law.â 12 U.S.C. Â§
5536(ay1 A).

EFTA is a âFederal consumer financial law.â 12 U.S.C, Â§
5481 2\KC), 14).
By violating EFTA as described in paragraphs 55 to 60, Respondent

violated the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)C1 WA).
