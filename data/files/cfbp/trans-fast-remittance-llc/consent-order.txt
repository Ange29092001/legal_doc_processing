acts or practices in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010

(CFPA), 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(a), 5536, by making misleading statements in

Bureau Findings and Conclusions

The Bureau finds the following:

Until approximately June 15, 2020, Respondent was a non-bank Remittance
Transfer Provider with its principal place of business in New York, New
York. Among other activities, Respondent provided international money
transfers, including Remittance Transfers.

Respondent is licensed in over 30 states and sent Remittance Transfers from

the United States to recipients in over 100 countries. Until approximately
June 15, 2020, Respondent provided Remittance Transfers at storefront
locations independently owned and operated by about 3,000 individual
agents located in storefronts across the country. Until about February 2020,
Respondent also provided Remittance Transfers over the internet and
through mobile applications.

Respondent is a âcovered personâ under the CFPA because it offered or
provided electronic-funds-transmission services and payment services. 12
U.S.C. Â§ 5481(6), (15 )(A)iv), (15 (A)(vii).

Respondent is a Remittance Transfer Provider under EFTA because it
provided Remittance Transfers for consumers in the normal course of its
business. 15 U.S.C. Â§ 16930-1(g)(3).

In 2010, EFTA was amended to create a new Â§ 919 of the EFTA. Section
919 requires Remittance Transfer Providers to provide disclosures to senders
of Remittance Transfers, pursuant to rules prescribed by the Bureau, and
also provides for specific cancellation, refund, and error resolution
procedures.

The Bureau issued rules to implement these requirements, which became
effective on October 28, 2013. These rules are known as the Remittance

Rule.
10.

11.

Since the October 28, 2013 effective date of the Remittance Rule,
Respondent has been subject to the requirements of Â§ 919 of EFTA and the
Remittance Rule.

As described below, Respondent violated many of the Remittance Ruleâs
cancellation, refund, disclosure and error-resolution requirements and

engaged in deceptive acts or practices in providing Remittance Transfers.

Findings and Conclusions as to Violations of EFTA and the Remittance Rule

12.

13.

14.

Respondent failed to process cancellation requests
in violation of the Remittance Rule

A Remittance Transfer Provider must âcomply with the requirements of

Â§ 1005.34 with respect to any oral or written request to cancel a Remittance
Transfer from the senderâ that provides certain required information and is
received within the Remittance Ruleâs cancellation timeframe requirements.
12 C.F.R. Â§ 1005.34(a).

A Remittance Transfer Provider must provide a refund within three business
days of receipt of a timely cancellation request. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1005.34(b).
Since the October 28, 2013 effective date of the Remittance Rule through at
least August 2019, Respondentâs practice was to require consumers who
initiated a Remittance Transfer at a storefront with one of its agents to

request cancellation only through that same agent.
15.

16.

17.

Since the October 28, 2013 effective date of the Remittance Rule through at
least August 2019, Respondent violated 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1005.34(a) by failing to
accept valid cancellation requests via telephone and provide the requisite
refunds.

Respondent failed to resolve errors
in violation of EFTA and the Remittance Rule

If a consumer asserts an error consistent with the process required by the

Remittance Rule, the Remittance Rule and EFTA require Remittance

Transfer Providers to âinvestigate promptly and determine whether an error

occurred within 90 days of the assertion of an error.â 12 C.F.R. Â§

1005.33(c)(1); see also 15 U.S.C. Â§ 16930-1(d)(1)(A).

The Remittance Rule broadly establishes five categories of errors, subject to

enumerated exceptions:

a. The consumer pays an incorrect amount to send the Remittance Transfer;

b. The Remittance Transfer Provider makes a computational or
bookkeeping error;

c. The amount disclosed is not made available to the recipient;

d. The transferred funds are not available to the recipient on the date
disclosed; and

e. The consumer requests information or documentation. 12 C.F.R.

Â§ 1005.33(a)(1).
18.

19.

20.

21.

If an error occurred, a Remittance Transfer Provider must then follow the
Remittance Ruleâs procedures for remedying the error, which may include a
refund of the Remittance Transfer, including fees.

Since the October 28, 2013 effective date of the Remittance Rule through at
least August 2019, Respondent did not identify errors under the Remittance
Rule and had no policies or procedures related to how to investigate and
respond to notices of error.

In addition, when a consumer called Respondent with a complaint about a
Remittance Transfer, Respondent only provided information over the phone
in response to that complaint and did not take any other action in response to
that complaint. Ifa consumer called and alleged an error that Respondent
could not appropriately resolve under the Remittance Rule by providing
information, Respondent did not process the consumerâs request. Instead,
Respondent required the consumer to contact the agent at the storefront at
which the transfer was originated.

Respondent frequently failed to investigate and determine whether a
Remittance Rule error occurred after consumers asserted errors and failed to
follow the Remittance Ruleâs error resolution procedures for any error

asserted over the phone that would have required responsive action, like
22.

providing refunds, resending transfers, or correcting an incorrect transfer
amount.

Respondent violated 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1005.33(c)(1) and 15 U.S.C. Â§ 16930-
1(d)(1)(A) in cases when consumers properly notified Respondent and

Respondent failed to investigate and determine whether an error occurred.

Respondent failed to refund fees for date of availability errors in violation of

23.

24.

25.

EFTA and the Remittance Rule
Under Â§ 1005.33(a) of the Remittance Rule, it is generally an âerrorâ if a
Remittance Transfer Provider fails to make funds available to a designated
recipient by the date of availability stated in the receipt or disclosure that the
Provider must provide to a sender. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1005.33(a).
If a consumer appropriately asserts a date of availability error consistent
with the ruleâs requirements, Â§ 1005.33(c)(2)(1)(B) requires a Remittance
Transfer Provider to refund the fees imposed on the Remittance Transfer
when the Provider fails to make the funds available to the recipient by the
date of availability identified in the transfer receipt. 12 C.F.R.
Â§ 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)(B).
Respondentâs practice was to not refund fees to consumers if the transfer
was already received, even if the transfer was received after the date

disclosed on the receipt. But the Remittance Rule required Respondent to
26.

refund fees imposed on the transfer if the transfer occurred after the date
disclosed, regardless of whether the transfer was ultimately received.
When the consumer properly asserted a date of availability error and no
applicable exclusion applied, Respondent violated 12 C.F.R.

Â§ 1005.33(c)(2)(G1)(B) when it did not provide refunds of fees to consumers

when the transfer was received after the date disclosed.

Respondent failed to develop and maintain written policies and procedures
designed to ensure compliance with error resolution requirements of the

Remittance Rule
A Remittance Transfer Provider must develop and maintain written policies
and procedures designed to ensure compliance with the Remittance Ruleâs
error resolution requirements, including 12 C.F.R. $$ 1005.33(c)(1), (c)(2),
or (d)(1). 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1005.33(g)(1).
For example, Remittance Transfer Providers must investigate promptly and
determine whether an error occurred within 90 days of receiving a notice of
error. They further must provide to Remittance Transfer senders a written
explanation of the Providerâs findings and note the senderâs right to request
the documents on which the Provider relied in making its determination if no
error was found. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1005.33(c)(1) and (d)(1).
Since the October 28, 2013 effective date of the Remittance Rule and

through at least 2019, Respondent had not developed or maintained written

policies and procedures necessary to ensure compliance with Â§Â§
1005.33(c)(1), (c)(2), or (d)(1).
Respondent therefore violated 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1005.33(g)(1).

Respondent failed to provide required disclosures
in violation of EFTA and the Remittance Rule

The Remittance Rule requires Remittance Transfer Providers to make
specific disclosures to every consumer. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1005.31.

The Remittance Rule requires Remittance Transfer Providers to disclose
âthe date in the foreign country on which funds will be available to the
designated recipient, using the term âDate Availableâ or a substantially
similar term.â 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1005.31(b)(2)(i1). Remittance Transfer Providers
may provide a statement that funds may be available to the recipient earlier
than the date disclosed, using the term âmay be available soonerâ or a
substantially similar term. /d.

The electronic disclosures Respondent provided to consumers initiating
online Remittance Transfers used the term âEstimated Deliveryâ to
characterize the date of availability. Providing an âestimateâ of the date of
availability does not comply with the Remittance Rule. Respondent provided
about 180,000 disclosures using the âEstimated Deliveryâ language in 2019

alone.

The Remittance Rule requires Remittance Transfer Providers to disclose any
fees collected on the Remittance Transfer using the term âTransfer Feesâ or
a âsubstantially similar term.â 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1005.31(b)(1)qi).

For transfers initiated through Respondentâs agents at storefronts, customers
were provided with a disclosure listing four different kinds of fees: âService
fee,â âFee Rate,â âHandling fee,â (or âHandling,â) and âDiscount.â Since
the October 28, 2013 effective date of the Remittance Rule and through at
least 2019, Respondents provided about 40 million disclosures containing
these terms.

Those terms are not substantially similar to the term âTransfer Fees,â and are
not otherwise permissible under the Remittance Rule.

The EFTA requires a Remittance Transfer Provider to disclose a statement
containing âinformation about the rights of the sender under this section
regarding the resolution of errors.â 15 U.S.C. Â§ 16930-1(a)(2)B(i)(1). The
EFTA also established certain error and cancellation rights and certain
remedies available to senders. 15 U.S.C. Â§ 16930-1(d)(1)(A) & (B).

The Remittance Rule requires Remittance Transfer Providers to disclose to a
sender ââa statement about the rights of the sender regarding the resolution of

errors and cancellation, using language set forth in Model Form A-37 of

Appendix A to this part or substantially similar language.â 12 C.F.R.

Â§ 1005.3 1(b)(2)(iv).

Respondent did not provide a âstatement about the rights of the senderâ in a
form substantially similar to the Model Form A-37 language. Instead, the
receipt and disclosure Respondent provided to consumers contained
âconditions of serviceâ that included nearly a page of conditions not found
in the Model Form A-37. Those âconditions of serviceâ did not state that
senders âhave a right to dispute errors in your transactionâ or request a
written statement of rights, which are provisions contained in Model Form
A-37.

Since the October 28, 2013 effective date of the Remittance Rule,
Respondent provided about 40 million disclosures containing these terms to
consumers.

Respondent therefore violated 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1005.31 when it (1) disclosed an
âEstimated Deliveryâ for the funds; (2) failed to appropriately disclose
transfer fees; and (3) provided inaccurate information about the rights of the

sender under EFTA.

regarding the speed of its Remittance Transfers
When offering one of its Remittance Transfer services, Respondent
represented that they provided âan instant to 24-hour delivery.â In
advertisements for its Remittance Transfer services generally, Respondent
advertised an âinstant transfer,â or a transfer âwithin minutes.â
But Respondent did not provide Remittance Transfers within the advertised
timeframes.
Section 1036(a)(1)(B) of the CFPA prohibits âunfair, deceptive, or abusiveâ
acts or practices. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(B).
As described in Paragraph 42, in connection with the advertising, marketing,
promoting, offering for sale, or sale of its Remittance Transfer services, in
numerous instances, Respondent has represented, expressly or impliedly,
that the services had âan instant to 24-hour delivery,â would provide an
âinstant transfer,â or a transfer âwithin minutes.â
In fact, Respondent did not provide Remittance Transfers within the
advertised timeframes.
Thus, Respondentâs representations, as described in Paragraph 42, constitute
deceptive acts or practices in violation of sections 1031(a) and 1036(a)(1)(B)

of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. 8Â§ 5531(a), 5536(a)(1)\(B).

Deceptive acts or practices by making misleading statements in disclosures

purporting to limit consumersâ error resolution rights
When consumers purchased Respondentâs Remittance Transfer services,
Respondent provided to the consumer a disclosure and receipt that included
statements that:
a. Error notices consumers submitted after 90 days would be accepted at
Respondentâs âoptionâ; and
b. Respondent âassumes no obligation except as stipulated hereinâ and âwill
not be responsible for non-performance or loss due to circumstances
beyond our control.â
But EFTA and the Remittance Rule require Remittance Transfer Providers,
including Respondent, to investigate and remedy errors when consumers
provide an error notice within 180 days of the promised date of delivery, not
the 90 days Respondent stated. 15 U.S.C. Â§ 16930-1(d)(1)(A); 12 C.F.R.
Â§ 1005.33(b)(1)(i).
The Remittance Rule also provides that Remittance Transfer Providers,
including Respondent, are liable for errors, including acts of agents when
such agent acts for the Provider. This means that, contrary to Respondentâs
statement, Respondent may have been responsible for non-performance or
loss due to circumstances beyond its control or beyond the circumstances

stated in its disclosures.

Section 1036(a)(1)(B) of the CFPA prohibits âunfair, deceptive, or abusiveâ
acts or practices. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(B).

As described in Paragraph 48, in connection with the advertising, marketing,
promoting, offering for sale, or sale of its Remittance Transfer services, in
numerous instances, Respondent has represented, expressly or impliedly,
that error notices consumers submitted after 90 days would be accepted at
Respondentâs âoption,â and that Respondent âassumes no obligation except
as stipulated hereinâ and âwill not be responsible for non-performance or
loss due to circumstances beyond our control.â

In fact, EFTA and the Remittance Rule require Remittance Transfer
Providers, including Respondent, to investigate and remedy errors when
consumers provide an error notice within 180 days of the promised date of
delivery, and the Remittance Rule also provides that Remittance Transfer
Providers, including Respondent, are liable for errors, including acts of
agents when such agent acts for the Provider.

Respondentâs misrepresentations about the acceptance of error notices were
likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under the circumstances and
were material because they were likely to affect the conduct or decisions of

consumers.

Thus, Respondentâs representations, as described in Paragraph 48, constitute
deceptive acts or practices in violation of sections 1031(a) and 1036(a)(1)(B)
of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).

Role of the Board

The Board must review all submissions (including plans, reports, programs,
policies, and procedures) required by this Consent Order prior to submission
to the Bureau.
Although this Consent Order requires Respondent to submit certain
documents for review or non-objection by the Enforcement Director, the
Board will have the ultimate responsibility for proper and sound
management of Respondent and for ensuring that Respondent complies with
the laws that the Bureau enforces, including Federal consumer financial laws
and this Consent Order.
In each instance that this Consent Order requires the Board to ensure
adherence to, or perform certain obligations of Respondent, the Board must:
a. Authorize whatever actions are necessary for Respondent to fully comply

with the Consent Order;

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that:

65. Under Â§ 1055(c) of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5565(c), by reason of the

civil money penalty of $1,600,000 to the Bureau.

compliance with the Bureauâs wiring instructions.

Respondent, for all purposes, must treat the civil money penalty paid under
this Consent Order as a penalty paid to the government. Regardless of how
the Bureau ultimately uses those funds, Respondent may not:
a. Claim, assert, or apply for a tax deduction, tax credit, or any other tax
benefit for any civil money penalty paid under this Consent Order; or
b. Seek or accept, directly or indirectly, reimbursement or indemnification
from any source, including but not limited to payment made under any
insurance policy, with regard to any civil money penalty paid under this
Consent Order.
To preserve the deterrent effect of the civil money penalty in any Related
Consumer Action, Respondent may not argue that Respondent is entitled to,
nor may Respondent benefit by, any offset or reduction of any compensatory
monetary remedies imposed in the Related Consumer Action because of the
civil money penalty paid in this action or because of any payment that the
Bureau makes from the Civil Penalty Fund. If the court in any Related
Consumer Action offsets or otherwise reduces the amount of compensatory
monetary remedies imposed against Respondent based on the civil money
penalty paid in this action or based on any payment that the Bureau makes
from the Civil Penalty Fund, Respondent must, within 30 days after entry of

a final order granting such offset or reduction, notify the Bureau, and pay the

amount of the offset or reduction to the U.S. Treasury. Such a payment will
not be considered an additional civil money penalty and will not change the
amount of the civil money penalty imposed in this action.

under this Consent Order, interest, computed under 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1961, as
amended, will accrue on any outstanding amounts not paid from the date of
default to the date of payment, and will immediately become due and
payable.

Respondent must relinquish all dominion, control, and title to the funds paid
to the fullest extent permitted by law and no part of the funds may be
returned to Respondent.

Under 31 U.S.C. Â§ 7701, Respondent, unless it already has done so, must
furnish to the Bureau its taxpayer-identification numbers, which may be
used for purposes of collecting and reporting on any delinquent amount
arising out of this Consent Order.

Within 30 days of the entry of a final judgment, consent order, or settlement

in a Related Consumer Action, Respondent must notify the Enforcement
