In the Matter of: CONSENT ORDER

Nissan Motor Acceptance Corporation

 

 

The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau) has reviewed
repossession and servicing activities by Nissan Motor Acceptance Corporation
(Respondent, as defined below) and has identified the following law violations:
(1) Respondent wrongfully repossessed some vehicles despite having agreements
in place with consumers to prevent repossession; (2) Respondent, through
repossession agents, kept personal property that was located in consumersâ
vehicles at the time of repossession and would not return that personal property
until consumers paid a fee for its storage; (3) Respondent, through its service
provider, deprived consumers making auto-loan payments by phone of the ability

to select a payment option with a significantly lower fee than the one they were
AAA RE ANA? my ak ett AEA IN mt aN

charged; and (4) Respondent made a deceptive statement in its agreements to
extend consumersâ auto loans that appeared to limit consumersâ bankruptcy
protections. These actions violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010
(CFPA), 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531, 5536. Under Sections 1053 and 1055 of the Consumer
Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA), 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5563, 5565, the Bureau

issues this Consent Order (Consent Order).

an agreement with the consumer, reflected in Respondentâs system
notes, phone recordings, or electronic or other written
communications (together, âRespondentâs Recordsâ), and told the
consumer that the repossession would be postponed for a certain
amount of time due to an action that the consumer took, but

had been made, a repossession will not be deemed a Wrongful
Repossession under this Consent Order if it occurred less than one
business day after the consumerâs payment was made. Finally,
where a consumer made a payment described in subpart 3.1.b(1) or
3.1.b(i11) through a channel other than Respondentâs online

IV
Bureau Findings and Conclusions

The Bureau finds the following:
Respondent is an auto financing subsidiary of Nissan North America, Inc.
that services loans and leases.
Nissan and Infiniti dealerships nationwide originate and then assign the

loans and leases to Respondent.

Respondentâs auto loan servicing operations are based in Irving, Texas.
NMAC services millions of Accounts, representing billions of dollars in
outstanding principal. In 2018, dealerships assigned NMAC over 382,000
new loans and 299,000 new leases. That same year, NMAC serviced
$49.3 billion in outstanding loans and leases.
Respondent is a âcovered personâ under the CFPA because it is in the
business of servicing Accounts. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(6), (15)(A)Q@).
Findings and Conclusions as to Unfair Acts or Practices

Sections 1031 and 1036(a)(1)(B) of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531,
5536(a)(1)(B), prohibits covered persons from engaging âin any unfair,
deceptive, or abusive act or practice.â
An act or practice is unfair if it causes or is likely to cause substantial
injury to consumers that is not reasonably avoidable by consumers and that
is not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or competition.
12 U.S.C. Â§ 5531(c)(1).

Respondent Wrongfully Repossessed Consumersâ Vehicles
When NMAC consumers miss Account payments, Respondent asks them
to make a promise to pay by a certain date, or to enter into an agreement to

extend their loan, known as an extension agreement, to avoid repossession.

Respondent periodically attempts to contact consumers concerning missed
payments from the time consumers miss the first payment until the vehicle
is repossessed.

From 2013 through at least 2018, Respondentâs policy was not to refer an
Account for repossession when the consumer had an active promise to
payâmeaning the consumer had made a promise to pay by a date that had
not yet passedâor had recently entered an extension agreement to resolve
the consumerâs delinquency.

Respondent informed consumers that it would not repossess their vehicles
if the consumers paid to decrease their delinquency to under 60 days past
due, kept a promise to pay, or entered into an extension agreement.
Respondent also informed consumers that it would not repossess vehicles
if the consumersâ payments were less than 60 days past due.

From 2013 through September of 2019, Respondent repossessed the
vehicles of hundreds of consumers who had: (1) made payments that
decreased their delinquency to less than 60 days past due; (11) made and
kept promises to pay; (iii) made promises to pay by a future date that had
not yet passed; or (iv) agreed to extension agreements with Respondent.
Each of these actions taken by consumers should have prevented

repossessions.

As aresult of Respondentâs Wrongful Repossessions consumers lost the
use of their vehicles. Many also experienced other consequences, such as
missed work, expenses for alternative transportation, repossession-related
fees, detrimental credit reporting, and vehicle damage in the repossession
process.

Respondentâs Wrongful Repossessions caused or were likely to cause
substantial injury to consumers that was not reasonably avoidable or
outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or competition.
Thus, Respondent engaged in unfair acts and practices, in violation of the

CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(c), 5536(a)(1)(B).

Respondent, Through its Repossession Agents, Engaged in Unfair Acts and

20.

21.

22.

Practices by Withholding Consumersâ Personal Belongings Until the

Consumers Paid an Upfront Fee
Respondent contracts with ârepossession forwardersâ to manage
repossessions of consumersâ vehicles on behalf of NMAC.
After Respondent identifies a vehicle for repossession, Respondent assigns
it to a repossession forwarder to manage the process.
Respondentâs repossession forwarders then assign Respondentâs
repossessions to repossession agents, who pick up consumersâ vehicles on

behalf of Respondent.
23.

24.

25.

26.

27.

28.

Respondent provides information to the repossession forwarders indicating
that a vehicle should be repossessed.

Respondent does not advise its consumers the date or time when a
repossession will occur.

After repossessions occur, Respondent sends communications to
consumers whose vehicles have been repossessed indicating that the
repossession has occurred and noting what consumers will have to pay to
recover their vehicles.

Consumersâ vehicles in many instances contain the consumersâ personal
property. Consumers reported that ttems such as childrenâs car seats,
college textbooks, and prescription sunglasses were in their vehicles when
the vehicles were repossessed.

From at least early 2014 through late August 2017, Respondentâs
repossession agents in many instances imposed fees on consumers for
holding personal property contained in repossessed vehicles. These
repossession agents often refused to return consumersâ personal property
unless and until the consumers paid the fees.

Respondent knew that its repossession agents often refused to return
consumersâ personal property until after the consumers paid the upfront

fees.

Respondent represented to some consumers that it had no control over the
fees repossession agents charged, but in some instances Respondent
directed repossession forwarders to have repossession agents lower the
fees charged to consumers.

Some consumers whose vehicles were repossessed could not recover their
personal property because they did not pay the fees. Others were denied
access to their personal property until they paid the upfront fees.

The practice of withholding consumersâ personal property unless
consumers paid an upfront fee to recover it caused or was likely to cause
substantial injury that is not reasonably avoidable or outweighed by
countervailing benefits to consumers or competition.

Respondent is liable for the actions of its repossession agents related to
detaining consumersâ personal property.

Respondent, through its repossession agents, therefore engaged in unfair
acts and practices, in violation of the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(c),

5536(a)(1)(B).

Respondent, Through its Service Provider, Deprived Consumers of the Ability

34.

to Choose Pay by Phone Options with Significantly Lower Fees
Respondent permits consumers to make Account payments online,

telephonically, by mail, or through an auto-debit program.

Respondent engaged a third-party payment processor to handle consumer
calls regarding telephonic payments and to process those payments.

This payment processor handled over 18 million payments for Respondent
between 2012 and 2017. The payment processorâs agents spoke to
consumers on Respondentâs behalf to obtain payments on Respondentâs
Accounts.

From 2012 through late 2017, the payment processor charged
Respondentâs consumers $5 for payments by electronic check or in-
network debit-card payments and $12.95 for credit-card and out-of-
network debit-card payments. In-network debit-cards are cards that could
be processed without a PIN over the Star, NYCE, Pulse, or Accel ATM
networks.

Until at least late 2017, some of Respondentâs consumer-facing materials,
such as billing invoices, stated that âtransaction fees may applyâ for
telephonic payments.

None of Respondentâs consumer-facing materials disclosed the fee
amounts for telephonic payments or the considerable price difference
between available methods of payment by phone.

Many of Respondentâs customers called and made payments by phone

through Respondentâs third-party phone-payment processor. Many of

those consumers elected to make credit-card or out-of-network debit-card
payments. In many cases where consumers elected one of those options,
Respondentâs third-party phone-payment-processing vendor failed to tell
consumers about significant differences in the fees.
This practice caused or was likely to cause substantial injury to consumers.
Numerous consumers were charged $7.95 more to make a phone payment
than they would have been if they had selected a different payment option,
and they often made those selections without information about the lower-
fee options.
This injury was not reasonably avoidable or outweighed by countervailing
benefits to consumers or competition.
Respondent is liable for the acts of the third-party payment processor.
Respondent, through the third-party payment processor, therefore engaged
in unfair acts and practices, in violation of the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§
5531(c), 5536(a)(1)(B).

Findings and Conclusions as to Deceptive Acts or Practices
An act or practice is deceptive under the CFPA if (1) there is a
representation or omission of information that is likely to mislead
consumers acting reasonably under the circumstances; and (11) that

information is material to consumers.

Respondentâs Extension Agreements Misrepresented Consumersâ
Bankruptcy Rights

Respondent offers loan extension agreements to some consumers who are
experiencing financial difficulties.
From at least January 2012 through February 2017, Respondentâs
extension agreement contracts, as well as written confirmations it sent to
consumers who agreed to extensions orally, included the following
language:

As acondition of you making this request, you represent that you

have not filed and agree that you will not file for bankruptcy

protection within 120 days after the date of this correspondence, and

that an extension is contingent upon the absence of any such filing. If

you should so file for bankruptcy protection, then this agreement is

void for misrepresentation, and we may seek payment of the extended

payments as originally scheduled and may deem such payment to be

in default.
From 2012 through 2016, Respondent sent extension agreements or
written confirmations of oral agreements including this language to
between 50,000 to 150,000 consumers each year.
Respondentâs extension agreements created the net impression that
consumers could not file for bankruptcy.
In truth and in fact, consumers could file for bankruptcy. An agreement to

waive an individualâs right to file for bankruptcy is void as against public

policy.

14
2020-BCFP-0017 Document1 Filed 10/13/2020 Page 15 of 40

51. These statements are material because they were likely to affect
consumersâ conduct in executing the written extension agreement or
considering whether to file for bankruptcy.

52. Respondentâs representations were false and misleading and constituted
deceptive acts or practices, in violation of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§

5531(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).

costs) and other reasonable and verifiable consequential damages
incurred by the consumer. Such remediation must be paid to any
consumer whose vehicle is Wrongfully Repossessed within the later of
seven business days of notification that the repossession was a Wrongful
Repossession, or two business days after Respondentâs receipt of
evidence of actual costs incurred. It is further provided that Respondent
must promptly notify the consumer of her right to provide such evidence
of actual costs incurred;

Effective Date to determine whether information Respondent
furnished to any consumer reporting agency requires correction
or updating consistent with 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1681s-2(a)(2); and

2. Shall use the results of the review required by paragraph (1)(1)

the event that Respondent cannot, after its review, verify that
information it furnished about Affected Consumers requires
correction or updating, it shall request that the consumer
reporting agency delete the furnished information, unless the
final account status or payment rating indicates that the account
is current. Respondent will not thereafter re-furnish any

inaccurate or incomplete information.

Redress will be paid in two forms to Affected Consumers: through checks
mailed by Respondent to consumers (Cash Redress), and through credits
Respondent will provide to consumers for any repossession fees for
Wrongful Repossessions still outstanding on Affected Consumersâ

Accounts (Credit Redress), as follows:

a. Respondent will provide Cash Redress to each Affected Consumer for
loss of use of their vehicles for the number of days they were without
their vehicle;

Regional Director for non-objection a proposal for retaining an
independent third-party administrator (ITPA) for the purpose of
conducting a review of consumer files to identify all consumers whose
vehicles have been Wrongfully Repossessed and the amount of Cash
Redress and Credit Redress owed to each consumer (Independent Third-

including a standard address search using the National Change of

Affected Consumers as a result of Respondentâs review under this
provision shall be documented and provided to the Bureau prior to

$750,000, within 30 days of the completion of the Redress Plan,
Respondent must pay to the Bureau, by wire transfer to the Bureau or to
the Bureauâs agent, and according to the Bureauâs wiring instructions, the

Consumers and $750,000. If the total amount of Cash Redress due to
Affected Consumers under this Section is greater than $1,000,000, the
amount paid to each Affected Consumer may be reduced pro rata using
$1,000,000 as the total Cash Redress amount available to Affected
Consumers and Respondent will not be responsible for any further Cash
Redress in excess of $1,000,000.

The Bureau may use any remaining funds due to it under Paragraph 70 to
pay additional redress to Affected Consumers. If the Bureau determines, in
its sole discretion, that additional redress is wholly or partially
impracticable or otherwise inappropriate, or if funds remain after the
additional redress is completed, the Bureau will deposit any remaining
funds in the U.S. Treasury as disgorgement. Respondent will have no right
to challenge any actions that the Bureau or its representatives may take
under this Section.

Under section 1055(c) of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5565(c), by reason of the
violations of law described in Section IV of this Consent Order, and taking

civil money penalty of $4 million to the Bureau.

Within 10 days of the Effective Date, Respondent must pay the civil
money penalty by wire transfer to the Bureau or to the Bureauâs agent in
compliance with the Bureauâs wiring instructions.

Order; or
b. Seek or accept, directly or indirectly, reimbursement or
indemnification from any source, including but not limited to
payment made under any insurance policy, with regard to any civil

Consumer Action, Respondent may not argue that Respondent is entitled
to, nor may Respondent benefit by, any offset or reduction of any
compensatory monetary remedies imposed in the Related Consumer
Action because of the civil money penalty paid in this action. If the court
in any Related Consumer Action offsets or otherwise reduces the amount
of compensatory monetary remedies imposed against Respondent based on
the civil money penalty paid in this action or based on any payment that
the Bureau makes from the Civil Penalty Fund, Respondent must, within
30 days after entry of a final order granting such offset or reduction, notify
the Bureau, and pay the amount of the offset or reduction to the U.S.
Treasury. Such a payment will not be considered an additional civil money

penalty and will not change the amount of the civil money penalty

returned to Respondent.

Under 31 U.S.C. Â§ 7701, Respondent, unless it already has done so, must

used for purposes of collecting and reporting on any delinquent amount
