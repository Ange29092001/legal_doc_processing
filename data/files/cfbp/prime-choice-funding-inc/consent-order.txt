In the Matter of:

CONSENT ORDER

Prime Choice Funding, Inc.

 

 

The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau) has reviewed certain
direct-mail mortgage advertising activities of Prime Choice Funding, Inc. (Prime
Choice or Respondent, as defined below) and identified violations of Â§ 1026.24 of
Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24, the implementing regulation of the Truth in
Lending Act (TILA), 15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1601â1667f; Â§ 1014.3 of the Mortgage Acts
and PracticesâAdvertising Rule (MAP Rule or Regulation N), 12 C.F.R. Â§
1014.3; and Â§Â§ 1031 and 1036 of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010
(CFPA), 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531, 5536. Under Â§8 1053 and 1055 of the CFPA, 12

U.S.C. 88 5563, 5565, the Bureau issues this Consent Order.
Overview
Prime Choice is a mortgage broker and lender that offers and provides
mortgages guaranteed by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs
(VA). Sometimes, it has acted as the creditor, providing loans itself; in other
situations, it has acted as a broker, arranging for another creditor to provide
loans.
Prime Choice advertises these mortgage products to consumers through
direct-mail advertising campaigns.
Prime Choice has sent consumers millions of advertisements that violate
federal law because of misleading and deceptive statements and inadequate
disclosures.
The Bureau brings this action to stop Prime Choice from distributing
advertisements with misleading and deceptive statements and inadequate
disclosures to servicemembers, veterans, and other consumers.

Prime Choiceâs principal means of advertising VA-guaranteed mortgages is
through direct-mail advertisements sent to consumers, including veterans
and servicemembers.

Since January 2016, Prime Choice has mailed millions of mortgage
advertisements to consumers in about 35 states and the District of Columbia.
Hundreds of thousands of consumers have received at least one of Prime
Choiceâs direct-mail advertisements, and thousands of consumers have

obtained mortgages through Prime Choice.

False, Misleading, and Inaccurate Representations

Federal consumer financial law contains numerous provisions banning the
use of misleading and deceptive statements in mortgage advertisements.
Despite those prohibitions, Prime Choice was responsible for both the
content of, and the dissemination of, numerous mortgage advertisements
during the Relevant Period that contained false, misleading, and inaccurate
statements, as described below.

False, Misleading, and Inaccurate
Representations About Cost and Other Credit Terms

Most of Prime Choiceâs mortgage advertisements stated specific credit
terms, such as an interest rate, annual percentage rate (APR), payment

amount, index, margin, or closing costs.
24.

25.

26.

27.

28.

29.

30.

By stating specific credit terms in its advertisements, Prime Choice
represented, expressly or by implication, that it arranged or offered a
mortgage with those credit terms.

In fact, Prime Choice did not arrange or offer mortgages with the specific
credit terms stated in many of those advertisements.

In numerous instances, Prime Choice misrepresented the actual credit terms
applicable to the mortgages that it would arrange or offer.

Numerous Prime Choice mortgage advertisements described mortgages with
a simple interest rate and APR combination that, on the date of the
advertisement, Prime Choice was not actually prepared to arrange or offer.
For example, Prime Choice advertisements sent to 84,000 consumers in
October 2018 advertised a variable-rate mortgage with a fixed interest rate
of 2.625% for the first five years and an APR of 3.375%.

In fact, the advertised APR was not correct for any loan that Prime Choice
was prepared to arrange or offer because it did not take into account the fully
indexed rate, required discount points, or origination, underwriting, or
funding fees.

The actual APR for this loan, calculated in accordance with Regulation Z
and taking into account the fully indexed rate, required discount points, and

origination, underwriting, and funding fees, was at least 4.042%.
31.

32.

33.

34.

35.

Accordingly, Prime Choice misrepresented the actual APR for loans offered
in these advertisements.

Numerous Prime Choice mortgage advertisements misrepresented the
payment amount applicable to the advertised loan.

For example, in an advertisement sent to a consumer in July 2016, Prime
Choice misstated the payment amounts that would apply to the advertised
loans. The advertisement stated that a consumer seeking a loan amount of
$366,715 could obtain a 2.75% APR fixed-rate loan with a payment amount
of $840, and that the consumer could obtain an additional $30,000 in cash
for a total new payment amount of $909. Those payment amounts were
false; the actual minimum payments that would apply to the advertised loans
were each at least $600 more than the advertised payment amounts.
Numerous Prime Choice mortgage advertisements misrepresented the
existence, nature, or amount of cash or credit available to the consumer in
connection with the mortgage.

For example, in advertisements sent to more than 87,000 consumers in April
2019, Prime Choice stated: âYou have been pre-selected for a U.S.
Department of Veteran Affairs program that allows you to combine your
mortgage and other debt, plus get an additional $27,500 in unrestricted cash

today for only $125.41 per month.â But in order for the consumer to
36.

37.

38.

39.

40.

âcombine [their] mortgage and other debtâ and obtain $27,500 in cash, the
consumer would have to have more than $27,500 in equity in their homeâa
factor that Prime Choice did not take into consideration when selecting the
recipients of the advertisement. The representation that $27,500 in cash was
available was likely false for many consumers.

Moreover, there was no way the consumer could obtain $27,500 in cash on
the same day as the advertisement, despite the representation that the cash
could be obtained âtoday.â

Numerous Prime Choice mortgage advertisements misrepresented variable-
rate loans as âfixedâ rate loans.

For example, Prime Choice advertisements sent to 99,200 consumers in July
2016 used the word âfixedâ in bold font and capitalized letters next to the
advertised interest rate on the front, but in fine print on the back, indicated
that the advertised loan was, in fact, a variable-rate mortgage.

In these advertisements, the phrase âAdjustable-Rate Mortgage,â âVariable-
Rate Mortgage,â or âARMâ did not appear before the first use of the word
âfixed,â nor was it at least as conspicuous as any use of the word âfixedâ in
the advertisements.

In these advertisements, each use of the word âfixedâ to refer to a rate or

payment was not accompanied by an equally prominent and closely
4).

42.

43.

44,

45.

proximate statement of the period for which the rate or payment would be
fixed and the fact that the rate may vary or the payment may increase after
that period.

Numerous Prime Choice mortgage advertisements misrepresented the
existence and amount of fees or costs to the consumer.

For example, Prime Choice advertisements sent to 99,200 consumers in July
2016 prominently featured the words âNO CLOSING COSTSâ on the front
page of the advertisements, in bold, capitalized letters, along with an
advertised APR of 2.75%.

But consumers could not obtain a loan from Prime Choice with an APR of
2.75% without paying closing costs. Therefore, in connection with the loan
that Prime Choice was advertising, the statement âNO CLOSING COSTSâ
was false.

Numerous Prime Choice mortgage advertisements contained inaccurate
disclosures that misrepresented certain factors used to determine the variable
rate applicable to the advertised mortgage, including the applicable index,
margin, or rate-increase caps.

For example, Prime Choice advertisements sent to 84,000 people in October

2018 stated that the margin was fixed at 1.75%. That statement was false
46.

47.

48.

49.

50.

because the margin for the loans offered in those advertisements was in fact
2%.

Consumers who received the advertisements described in Paragraphs 27-45
were likely to be misled by them.

The advertisements were also likely to affect consumersâ conduct or
decisions with regard to obtaining a loan.

False and Misleading Representations Related to the
Consumerâs Finances or Qualification for the Advertised Loan

Numerous Prime Choice mortgage advertisements misrepresented the
consumerâs likelihood of obtaining the advertised mortgage or a specific
credit term, including whether the consumer had been preapproved or
qualified for the advertised product or term.

For example, numerous Prime Choice advertisements stated that the
recipients of the advertisements had been âpre-selected for a U.S.
Department of Veteran Affairs programâ to obtain the advertised loan under
the terms stated in advertisement. But that statement was false because those
consumers had not actually been pre-selected for the advertised product or
the terms of that product.

In another example, Prime Choice advertisements sent to 321,000 consumers

in November and December 2018, prominently labeled âURGENT
SI.

52.

53.

54.

NOTICE,â included a quote from forbes.com stating that the Federal
Reserve âexpects three or more rate increases in 2018â and stated: âBased
on our information, this WILL affect your monthly budget.â The
advertisements further stated: âYou have been preselected and already have
what it takes to qualifyâ for the advertised loan products. These statements
were misleading because Prime Choice did not have specific information
about the finances of the consumer and the recipients had not been
preselected.

Numerous Prime Choice mortgage advertisements also contained misleading
comparisons between hypothetical credit terms and the terms of the
advertised product.

Specifically, Prime Choice advertisements sent to more than 30,000
consumers in March 2018 made a comparison between a hypothetical
payment ($664) and interest rate (19.90%) for the consumerâs current debt,
and an advertised payment amount ($121) and interest rate (2.625% / 3.25%
APR) for the advertised loan.

The payment amount and interest rate for the advertised loan were not
available for the full period of the loan.

The advertisements did not include a clear and conspicuous comparison to

each simple interest rate that would apply over the term of the loan or the
55.

56.

57.

58.

amount of each payment that would apply over the term of the loan.
Consumers who received the advertisements described in Paragraphs 48â54
were likely to be misled by them.

The advertisements were also likely to affect consumersâ conduct or
decisions with regard to obtaining a loan.

False and Misleading Representations About an
Affiliation with the Government

Numerous Prime Choice mortgage advertisements falsely represented,
directly or by implication, through the use of formats, symbols, or logos that
resemble those of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), that Prime Choice

was affiliated with the government or that the advertised product related to a
federal tax benefit, or was endorsed, sponsored by, or affiliated with the IRS.
For example, Prime Choice advertisements sent to 161,000 consumers
between June 2018 and January 2019 were formatted with text boxes that
strongly resembled an IRS form; were titled âLoan Review Notification |
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 2017â; and were labeled âForm 2017-1 Notification
of Eligibility,â using much larger font for the alleged form number (2017-
1)âa distinctive format used by the IRS. They also included the year
2017â printed in block letters with the â20â in white and the â17â in black,

another distinctive format used by the IRS.
59.

60.

61.

62.

63.

64.

In fact, Prime Choice was not affiliated with the government and the
products offered in these advertisements did not relate to any federal tax
benefits, nor were the products endorsed by, sponsored by, or affiliated with
the IRS.

Consumers who received the advertisements described in Paragraphs 57â59
were likely to be misled by them.

The advertisements were also likely to affect consumersâ conduct or
decisions with regard to obtaining a loan.

False and Misleading Representations About a Property Assessment
Numerous Prime Choice mortgage advertisements misrepresented that the
advertisements contained property assessments, that the sender had
conducted or obtained a property assessment, and that the loan terms offered
in the advertisement were based on a property assessment.

Specifically, Prime Choice advertisements sent to more than 30,000
consumers in March 2018 were captioned âRE: Property Assessment,â and
featured a photograph of the recipientâs property. Both the caption and photo
were visible through the envelopes and on the face of the advertisements.
There was no other text on the outside of the envelopes to indicate that they
were, in fact, mortgage advertisements and were not directly related to a

property assessment of the property in question.
65.

66.

67.

68.

The net impression of the mailers, from the outside of the envelope, was that
they contained a property assessment or were a response to such an
assessment. As seen from the outside of the envelopes, these mailers were
likely to mislead a consumer acting reasonably under the circumstances to
believe that the mailers contained or were in response to a property
assessment of the featured property.

Once the consumer opened the envelope, the contents of the enclosed
advertisement gave the net impression that Prime Choice had obtained an
assessment of the consumerâs property featured in the advertisement and that
the proposed loan terms were based on that assessment. The document title,
âRE: Property Assessment,â and the photograph of the property, both at the
top of the advertisement, were likely to mislead a consumer acting
reasonably under the circumstances to believe that Prime Choice had
obtained the property assessment or that the mailing was in response to an
assessment of this property, and that the loan terms promoted in the
advertisement were based on that assessment.

Consumers who received the advertisements described in Paragraphs 62-66
were likely to be misled by them.

The advertisements were also likely to affect consumersâ conduct or

decisions with regard to obtaining a loan.
69.

70.

71.

72.

73.

Inadequate Disclosures
Most of Prime Choiceâs mortgage advertisements stated a period of
repayment, payment amount, finance charge, or simple annual rate of
interest. Under certain sections of Regulation Z, including Â§ 1026.24(c), (d),
and (f), the use of these terms triggers specific disclosure requirements.
Many of the advertisements did not include the other disclosures that are
required, or did not include them in the manner required.
Numerous Prime Choice mortgage advertisements stated a simple annual
interest rate more conspicuously than the APR.
Specifically, Prime Choice advertisements sent to 99,600 consumers in
February 2017 stated a simple annual rate of 3.25% in bold font in the first
paragraph of the letter, and the APR was only stated in smaller, not-bolded
font elsewhere on the page.
Numerous Prime Choice mortgage advertisements stated the period of
repayment or the amount of a payment, but failed to state the terms of
repayment reflecting the consumerâs repayment obligations over the full
term of the loan.
For example, Prime Choice advertisements sent to more than 400,000
consumers in October 2017 stated a payment amount based on a discounted,

introductory rate of 2.25% that would apply for the first three years. After
74.

75.

the first three years, the rate would rise based on the applicable index and
margin, which was at least 2.96% as of the date of the advertisements. Thus,
higher monthly payments would apply for the remaining term of the loan,
but the advertisements did not state the number and period of the subsequent
payments and the amounts of those payments. The advertisements also failed
to state that the term of the advertised loan was 30 years.

Numerous Prime Choice advertisements for a mortgage loan for which more
than one interest rate would apply stated a simple annual rate of interest, but,
for variable-rate transactions, failed to state a rate determined by adding an
index and margin, based on a reasonably current index and margin; failed to
state the period during which each simple annual rate of interest would
apply; failed to state an accurate APR for the loan because the stated APR
was not correctly calculated under Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1026.17(c)
and 1026.22; or failed to state these terms clearly and conspicuously.

As an example of the various deficiencies described in Paragraph 74, Prime
Choice advertisements for a variable-rate mortgage sent to 137,000 people in
February 2018 stated an introductory annual rate of interest of 2.625% that

applied to the first three years of the advertised loan.
70.

77.

78.

79.

80.

81.

Although a variable rate applied to the remaining term of the loan, the
advertisements failed to state a rate determined by adding an index and
margin, based on a reasonably current index and margin.

The advertisements were dated February 15, 2018; the index during the 60-
day period before that date was at least 1.70%; the margin was 1.75%; and
thus the fully indexed rate, based on a reasonably current index and margin,
was at least 3.45%.

The advertisements did not state that rate, or any other rate determined by
adding an index and margin, based on a reasonably current index and
margin.

The only period stated in the advertisements was the initial three years; the
advertisements did not state the term of the loan or otherwise state the period
during which each simple annual rate of interest would apply.

Moreover, the APR disclosedâ2.99%âwas inaccurate. In fact, the APR for
the loans promoted in those advertisements was at least 3.26%. The APR
disclosed in the advertisements did not comply with the accuracy standards
set forth in 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.22(a)(2).

Numerous Prime Choice mortgage advertisements stated the amount of a
payment, but failed to state the amount of each payment that would apply

over the term of the loan (e.g., for adjustable-rate mortgages, payments
82.

83.

84.

based on the application of the sum of a reasonably current index and
margin); failed to state the period during which each payment would apply;
failed to state the fact that the advertised payments did not include amounts
for taxes and insurance premiums, if applicable, and that the actual payment
obligation would be greater; or failed to state these terms clearly and
conspicuously.

As an example of the various deficiencies described in Paragraph 81, Prime
Choice advertisements for a variable-rate mortgage sent to more than 16,000
consumers in November 2018 stated a payment amount that was based on a
discounted, introductory rate of 3.75%, which applied for the first five years.
That payment was not calculated based on the index and margin that would
be used to make subsequent payment adjustments over the remaining term of
the loan, and the advertisements failed to state such a payment amount.

As of the date of the advertisements, November 8, 2018, a reasonably
current index rate, based on the One-Year Constant Maturity Treasury rate,
was at least 2.53%, and the margin was fixed at 1.75%, making the fully
indexed rate at least 4.28%. Starting in year four, payments for the proposed
loan, based on the fully indexed rate, would be at least $580, not including
any applicable taxes and insurance premiums. No such payment amount was

stated in the advertisements.
85.

86.

87.

88.

89.

90.

Moreover, the advertisements failed to state, clearly and conspicuously, the
period during which each payment would apply.

In addition, the advertisements failed to state, clearly and conspicuously, that
the payments did not include amounts for taxes and insurance premiums, if
applicable, and that the actual payment obligation would be greater.

In another example, Prime Choice advertisements sent to more than 30,000
consumers in March 2018 stated a payment amount of $121, which was for
the advertised cash-out amount only and was based on a discounted,
introductory rate of 2.625%, which only applied for the first three years.
These advertisements failed to disclose subsequent payments after the initial
three years, failed to disclose the period in which each payment would

apply, failed to state the full payment amount, and failed to state that the
payment amounts did not include taxes and insurance premiums, if
applicable, and that the actual payment obligation would be greater.

In addition, the advertisements failed to state, clearly and conspicuously, that
the advertised payment did not include amounts for taxes and insurance
premiums, if applicable, and that the actual payment obligation would be
greater.

Numerous Prime Choice mortgage advertisements used the name of the

consumerâs current lender without disclosing with equal prominence the
91.

92.

93.

name of the person making the advertisement and without including a clear
and conspicuous statement that the person making the advertisement was not
associated with or acting on behalf of the consumerâs current lender.
For example, Prime Choice advertisements sent to 358,000 consumers
between April and July 2016 stated the name of the consumerâs current
lender at the top of the advertisements, while Prime Choiceâs name appeared
only in small print on the back of the advertisements. The advertisements
also failed to include a clear and conspicuous statement that the person
making the advertisement was not associated with or acting on behalf of the
consumerâs current lender.

Prime Choice violated Â§ 1026.24(a) because, as described in Paragraphs 23â

terms other than those terms that actually were or would be arranged or

offered by the creditor.

Inadequate Disclosure of Rates, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(f)(2)()

Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(f)(2)(1), ifa direct-mail mortgage advertisement:

states a simple annual rate of interest and more than one
simple annual rate of interest will apply over the term of the
advertised loan, the advertisement shall disclose in a clear and
conspicuous manner:

(A) Each simple annual rate of interest that will apply.
In variable-rate transactions, a rate determined by
adding an index and margin shall be disclosed based on

a reasonably current index and margin;

(B) The period of time during which each simple
annual rate of interest will apply; and

(C) The [APR] for the loan. If such rate is variable, the

[APR] shall comply with the accuracy standards in
Â§Â§ 1026.17(c) and 1026.22.

Prime Choice violated Â§ 1026.24(f)(2)(1) because, as described in Paragraphs
74-80, numerous Prime Choice direct-mail mortgage advertisements for a
loan for which more than one interest rate would apply stated a simple

annual rate of interest, but did not include one or more of the disclosures

required pursuant to Â§ 1026.24(f)(2)(1)(A) through (C), or did not disclose

Inadequate Disclosure of Payment Terms, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(f)(3)(i)

100. Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(f)(3)G), a direct-mail mortgage advertisement
that âstates the amount of any paymentâ must disclose, in a clear and
conspicuous manner:

(A) The amount of each payment that will apply over the term
of the loan, including any balloon payment. In variable-rate
transactions, payments that will be determined based on the
application of the sum of an index and margin shall be

disclosed based on a reasonably current index and margin;

(B) The period of time during which each payment will apply;
and

(C) In an advertisement for credit secured by a first lien on a
dwelling, the fact that the payments do not include amounts
for taxes and insurance premiums, if applicable, and that the
actual payment obligation will be greater.
101. Prime Choice violated Â§ 1026.24(f)(3)q) because, as described in Paragraphs
81â89, numerous Prime Choice direct-mail mortgage advertisements stated
the amount of a payment but did not include one or more of the disclosures

required pursuant to Â§ 1026.24(f)(3)(i)(A) through (C), or did not disclose

Misleading Use of the Word âFixed,â 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(i)(1)
102. Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(1)(1), mortgage advertisements may not:

Us[e] the word âfixedâ to refer to rates, payments, or the
credit transaction in an advertisement for variable-rate
transactions or other transactions where the payment will
increase, unless:

(i) In the case of an advertisement solely for one or more
variable-rate transactions,

(A) The phrase âAdjustable-Rate Mortgage,â
âVariable-Rate Mortgage,â or âARMâ appears in the
advertisement before the first use of the word âfixedâ
and is at least as conspicuous as any use of the word
âfixedâ in the advertisement; and

(B) Each use of the word âfixedâ to refer to a rate or
payment is accompanied by an equally prominent and
closely proximate statement of the time period for
which the rate or payment is fixed, and the fact that the
rate may vary or the payment may increase after that
period;

(ii) In the case of an advertisement solely for non-variable-
rate transactions where the payment will increase (e.g., a
stepped-rate mortgage transaction with an initial lower
payment), each use of the word âfixedâ to refer to the payment
is accompanied by an equally prominent and closely
proximate statement of the time period for which the payment
is fixed, and the fact that the payment will increase after that
period; or

(iii) In the case of an advertisement for both variable-rate
transactions and non-variable-rate transactions,

(A) The phrase âAdjustable-Rate Mortgage,â
âVariable-Rate Mortgage,â or âARMâ appears in the
advertisement with equal prominence as any use of the
term âfixed,â âFixed-Rate Mortgage,â or similar terms;
and

(B) Each use of the word âfixedâ to refer to a rate,
payment, or the credit transaction either refers solely to
the transactions for which rates are fixed and complies
with paragraph (1)(1)(ii) of this section, if applicable,
or, if it refers to the variable-rate transactions, is
accompanied by an equally prominent and closely
proximate statement of the time period for which the
rate or payment is fixed, and the fact that the rate may
vary or the payment may increase after that period.

103. Prime Choice violated Â§ 1026.24(i)(1) because, as described in Paragraphs
37â40, numerous Prime Choice mortgage advertisements for variable-rate
transactions used the word âfixedâ to refer to rates, payments, or the credit
transaction and did not comply with the requirements of Â§ 1026.24()(1)q)

through (ili).
Misleading Cost Comparisons, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(i)(2)

104. Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(i)(2), mortgage advertisements may not:

Mak[e] any comparison . . . between actual or hypothetical
credit payments or rates and any payment or simple annual
rate that will be available under the advertised product for a
period less than the full term of the loan, unless:

(1) In general. The advertisement includes a clear and
conspicuous comparison to the information required to
be disclosed under Â§ 1026.24(f)(2) and (3); and
(ii) Application to variable-rate transactions. If the
advertisement is for a variable-rate transaction, and the
advertised payment or simple annual rate is based on
the index and margin that will be used to make
subsequent rate or payment adjustments over the term
of the loan, the advertisement includes an equally
prominent statement in close proximity to the payment
or rate that the payment or rate is subject to adjustment
and the time period when the first adjustment will
occur.

105. Prime Choice violated Â§ 1026.24(i)(2) because, as described in Paragraphs
51â54, numerous Prime Choice mortgage advertisements contained a
comparison between actual or hypothetical payments or rates and a payment
or simple annual rate that would be available under the advertised loan for a
period less than the full term of the loan and did not comply with the

requirements of Â§ 1026.24(1)(2)Q) and (ii).
Misleading Use of the Current Lenderâs Name, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(i)(4)

106. Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(1)(4), mortgage advertisements may not:

Us[e] the name of the consumerâs current lender in an
advertisement that is not sent by or on behalf of the
consumerâs current lender, unless the advertisement:

(1) Discloses with equal prominence the name of the
person or creditor making the advertisement; and

specific credit terms were available or would be arranged or offered by the
creditor, including representations about specific APRs, payment amounts,

Respondent maintains documentation of such determination; and
Stating the name of the consumerâs current or prior lender, unless the

Respondent and its officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys who

have actual notice of this Consent Order, whether acting directly or

indirectly, in connection with the advertising, marketing, promotion, or

offering for sale of any mortgage credit product, must take the following

affirmative actions:

a.

Respondent must have prior substantiation for all express and implied
claims made in Respondentâs mortgage advertisements.

In any direct-mail mortgage advertisement that states a cash-out
amount for a cash-out refinance mortgage and a monthly payment
amount only for the portion of that mortgage used to obtain that cash-

out amount, Respondent must disclose Clearly and Prominently: (1)
that obtaining the stated cash-out amount requires the consumer to
refinance the entire amount of the consumerâs existing mortgage with
a new loan purchased from Respondent, and (2) the total monthly
payment amount(s) for such a refinanced mortgage.

If Respondent screens or selects consumers to receive any direct-mail
mortgage advertisements based on consumersâ credit scores or credit
tiers, those advertisements may only contain specific credit terms that
are available to consumers with a credit score equal to or less than the
credit score or credit tier that was used to identify the recipient
consumers.

In any direct-mail mortgage advertisement, if the advertisement states
an interest rate or APR that is available only to consumers whose
credit scores are above a threshold number, that fact (including the
applicable credit score threshold) must be disclosed Clearly and
Prominently on the same side of the advertisement as the advertised
interest rate or APR.

If a mortgage advertisement includes the amount or percentage of any
downpayment, the number of payments or period of repayment, the
amount of any payment, or the amount of any finance charge, the

advertisement must also include, at a minimum:
The amount or percentage of the downpayment;

The term of the loan in either months, years, or number of
monthly payments;

The amount of each payment that will apply over the term of
the loan, including any balloon payment. In variable-rate
transactions, payments that will be determined based on the
application of the sum of an index and margin shall be
disclosed based on a reasonably current index and margin;
The period during which each payment will apply;

The fact that the payments do not include amounts for taxes and
insurance premiums, if applicable, and that the actual payment
obligation will be greater;

The loan amount upon which the disclosures are based; and
The âannual percentage rate,â using that term, and, if the rate

may be increased after consummation, that fact.

In any direct-mail advertisement for an adjustable rate mortgage,

Respondent must:

State, Clearly and Prominently, that the product is an

âadjustable rate mortgage,â using those words. The
2020-BCFP-0006 Document1 Filed 07/24/2020 Page 46 of 64

advertisement may not use the term âhybridâ before the first use
of the phrase âadjustable rate mortgageâ;

For each simple annual rate of interest disclosed that is based
on an index and margin, base the rate on an index value in
effect on the date of the advertisement or within 60 days prior,
and disclose the index and margin; and

State that more information about adjustable rate mortgages is
available at https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201401_cfpb_

Advertising Review

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that:

Respondent, whether acting directly or indirectly, must take the following

affirmative actions:

a. Respondentâs Advertising Compliance Official must review each
mortgage advertisement template before any advertisement based on
that template is disseminated to a consumer to ensure that it is
compliant with TILA, Regulation Z, the MAP Rule, the CFPA, and
this Consent Order. This review must encompass any envelope or
mailer and all enclosures. This review includes reviewing all claims
made in the advertisement, expressly or by implication, to ensure that
they are accurate and substantiated.

b. Before any set of direct-mail advertisements based on a template is
mailed to consumers, the Advertising Compliance Official must
review an Exemplar of those advertisementsâincluding any
envelope, mailer, and enclosuresâto ensure that it is compliant with
TILA, Regulation Z, the MAP Rule, the CFPA, and this Consent
Order. This includes reviewing all claims made in the advertisement,

expressly or by implication, to ensure that they are accurate and
substantiated. All specific credit terms stated in the Exemplar must be
available and based on a reasonably current index rate, if applicable,
at the time the advertisement is disseminated. This requirement
applies whether the set is mailed as a single batch or in multiple
batches. It also applies whether the set is mailed out at a single time or
over a period.

The Advertising Compliance Official must document in writing his or
her review of each advertisement template or Exemplar. That
documentation must include a copy of the advertisement, the date of
the review, and documents sufficient to substantiate all claims made
in the advertisement, expressly or by implication. If the advertisement
includes specific rates, that documentation must also include a rate
sheet showing the availability of the advertised rate(s). If the
advertisement states an APR, that documentation must include a copy
of a worksheet showing the calculation of the APR, including all
inputs assumed when calculating that number. If the advertisement
states an amount of cash that a borrower might receive, the
documentation must state the method of arriving at that number and
include any materials used to determine the availability of that

amount.

153.

d. The Advertising Compliance Official and any employees with
responsibilities related to designing, developing, or approving the
content of Respondentâs mortgage advertisements must participate in
annual training on TILA, Regulation Z, the MAP Rule, and the CFPA,
as those laws apply to mortgage advertising.

Compliance Plan

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that:

Within 45 days of the Effective Date, Respondent must submit to the

Enforcement Director for review and determination of non-objection a

comprehensive compliance plan designed to ensure that Respondentâs

mortgage advertising complies with all applicable Federal consumer
financial laws and the terms of this Consent Order (Compliance Plan). The

Compliance Plan must include, at a minimum:

a. Detailed steps for addressing each action required by this Consent
Order; and
b. Specific timeframes and deadlines for implementation of the steps

described above.

The Enforcement Director will have the discretion to make a determination

of non-objection to the Compliance Plan or direct Respondent to revise it. If

Order to Pay Civil Money Penalty

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that:
Under Â§ 1055(c) of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5565(c), by reason of the
violations of law described in Section V of this Consent Order, and taking
into account the factors in 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5565(c)(3), Respondent must pay a
civil money penalty of $645,000 to the Bureau.
Within 10 days of the Effective Date, Respondent must pay the civil money
penalty by wire transfer to the Bureau or to the Bureauâs agent in

compliance with the Bureauâs wiring instructions.
157.

The civil money penalty paid under this Consent Order will be deposited in
the Civil Penalty Fund of the Bureau as required by Â§ 1017(d) of the CFPA,
12 U.S.C. Â§ 5497(d).
Respondent, for all purposes, must treat the civil money penalty paid under
this Consent Order as a penalty paid to the government. Regardless of how
the Bureau ultimately uses those funds, Respondent may not:
a. Claim, assert, or apply for a tax deduction, tax credit, or any other tax
benefit for any civil money penalty paid under this Consent Order; or
b. Seek or accept, directly or indirectly, reimbursement or
indemnification from any source, including but not limited to
payment made under any insurance policy, with regard to any civil
money penalty paid under this Consent Order.
To preserve the deterrent effect of the civil money penalty in any Related
Consumer Action, Respondent may not argue that Respondent is entitled to,
nor may Respondent benefit by, any offset or reduction of any compensatory
monetary remedies imposed in the Related Consumer Action because of the
civil money penalty paid in this action or because of any payment that the
Bureau makes from the Civil Penalty Fund. If the court in any Related
Consumer Action offsets or otherwise reduces the amount of compensatory

monetary remedies imposed against Respondent based on the civil money

penalty paid in this action or based on any payment that the Bureau makes
from the Civil Penalty Fund, Respondent must, within 30 days after entry of
a final order granting such offset or reduction, notify the Bureau, and pay the
amount of the offset or reduction to the U.S. Treasury. Such a payment will
not be considered an additional civil money penalty and will not change the
amount of the civil money penalty imposed in this action.

X.

Additional Monetary Provisions

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that:
In the event of any default on Respondentâs obligations to make payment
under this Consent Order, interest, computed under 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1961, as
amended, will accrue on any outstanding amounts not paid from the date of
default to the date of payment, and will immediately become due and
payable.
Respondent must relinquish all dominion, control, and title to the funds paid
to the fullest extent permitted by law and no part of the funds may be
returned to Respondent.
Under 31 U.S.C. Â§ 7701, Respondent, unless it already has done so, must

furnish to the Bureau its taxpayer-identification numbers, which may be
163.

164.

used for purposes of collecting and reporting on any delinquent amount
arising out of this Consent Order.

Within 30 days of the entry of a final judgment, consent order, or settlement
in a Related Consumer Action, Respondent must notify the Enforcement
Director of the final judgment, consent order, or settlement in writing. That
notification must indicate the amount of redress, if any, that Respondent paid
or is required to pay to consumers and describe the consumers or classes of

consumers to whom that redress has been or will be paid.
