Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Sues Student-Loan Debt-Relief Operation
for Taking Illegal Advance Fees and Settles with Some Participants

JUL 13, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. â The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) today filed a
complaint in the federal district court for the Central District of California against GST
Factoring, Inc., which runs a student-loan debt-relief business in Texas, and two of its
owners, Rick Graff and Gregory Trimarche, as well as Champion Marketing Solutions, LLC, a
customer service and marketing company, and its owner, Scott Freda. The Bureau also filed
suit against four attorneys, California attorneys Amanda Johanson and Jacob Slaughter,
Arizona attorney David Mize, and Florida attorney Daniel Ruggiero. The Bureau alleges that
the companies, their owners, and the attorneys were part of a nationwide student-loan
debt-relief operation that charged thousands of consumers saddled with private student-
loan debt approximately $11.8 million in illegal upfront fees in violation of the
Telemarketing Sales Rule (TSR). Concurrent with the complaint, the Bureau and four of the
defendants filed proposed stipulated final judgments and orders to resolve the claims
against them. If entered by the court, the orders will ban Trimarche, Slaughter, Mize, and
Ruggiero from participating in certain activities, impose monetary judgments to provide
consumer redress totaling approximately $11.8 million, and impose a civil money penalty.

Under the TSR, it is illegal to request or receive any fees for debt-relief services sold through
telemarketing before the debt is settled or renegotiated. But, as the complaint alleges, from
2015 through the present, the defendants violated the TSRâs prohibition on requesting or
receiving advance fees for debt-relief services, or substantially assisted others in violating
this prohibition by charging illegal advance fees purportedly to renegotiate student loan
debt. As the complaint alleges, the defendants did not wait to complete their work for
consumers, and instead charged fees right away by arranging for monthly payments over
the course of years that began at or just after consumers signed up for defendantsâ services.
Using telemarketing campaigns, the debt-relief operation led consumers to believe that
they were working solely with an attorney, but in fact, the feesâwhich were as large as about
40 percent of the consumersâ outstanding student-loan debtâwent to defendant GST
Factoring, which distributed the funds to the participants in the scheme. The complaint also
alleges that consumers were encouraged to stop paying their student loans all together.

The Bureau negotiated proposed stipulated final judgments and orders with four of the
defendants that were filed alongside the complaint. If entered by the court, the proposed
orders will permanently ban Trimarche from providing debt-relief services and
telemarketing any consumer financial product or service and impose permanent debt-relief
bans on Slaughter, Mize, and Ruggiero. The proposed orders would also impose monetary
judgments against the settling defendants to provide redress to the approximately 2,600
consumers who paid a total of approximately $11.8 million to the defendants over the
course of nearly five years. The full judgment amount will be suspended upon the settling
defendantsâ paying a portion of the redress based on their demonstrated inability to pay the
full amount. Each settling defendant will also pay a $1 civil money penalty to the Bureau.
Whenever the Bureau collects a civil money penalty through an enforcement action, that
penalty is deposited into the Bureau's Civil Penalty Fund. Assuming continued available
funds, the Bureau will work to provide full relief to eligible harmed consumers from this
fund.

If the proposed orders are entered by the Court, the Bureauâs lawsuit would continue to
proceed against Defendants GST Factoring, Champion Marketing Solutions, Graff, Freda,
and Johanson. The complaint seeks redress to consumers, an injunction, and the imposition
of civil money penalties against them. The complaint is not a finding or ruling that the
defendants have violated the law.
