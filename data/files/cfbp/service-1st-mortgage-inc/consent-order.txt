(15 )CA)G).
During the Relevant Period, Service Ist has been subject to the MAP Rule

because it is a person over which the Federal Trade Commission has

12 C.PLR.$ 1014.1. The MAP Rule is a Federal consumer financial law. 12
U.S.C, Â§ 548104).

Service Ist provides âmortgage credit product/s|,â as that term is defined in
the MAP Rule. 12 C.F_BR. Â§ 1014.2.

Service Istâs mortgage advertisements are âcommercial communicationsâ
regarding a term of a âmortgage credit product,â as those terms are defined
m i2CLPLR. Â§ 1014.2.

During the Relevant Period, Service Ist has offered âclosed-end creditâ in
the form of mortgage loans to âconsumers,â as those terms are defined in
Regulation 7. 12 CLR LR. Â§ 1026.2(a)010) & C1).

Service Istâs principal means of advertising VA-guaranteed mortgages is
through direct-mail advertisements sent to consumers, mcludmg veterans
and servicemembers.
Since December 2015, Service Ist has mailed millions of mortgage
advertisements to consumers in at least 12 states.
Hundreds of thousands of consumers have received at least one of Service
istâs direct-mail advertisements, and thousands of consumers have obtamed
mortgages through Service Ist.
False, Misleading, and Inaccurate Representations

Federal consumer financial law contains numerous provisions banning the
use of misleading and deceptive statements in mortgage advertisements.
Despite those prohibitions, Service Ist was responsible for both the content
of, and the dissemimation of, numerous mortgage advertisements during the
Relevant Period that contained false, misleading, and inaccurate statements,
as described below.

Faise, Misleading, and Inaccurate Representations About Cost
Most of Service Istâs mortgage advertisements stated specific credit terms,

such as an interest rate, annual percentage rate (APR), and payment amount.

By stating specrfic credit terms in its advertisements, Service Ist
represented, expressly or by implication, that it arranged or offered a
mortgage with those credit terms.

In fact, Service Ist did not arrange or offer mortgages with the specific
credit terms stated in many of those advertisements. While the advertised
introductory interest rate was available, the advertised APR was not.

In numerous instances, Service Ist misrepresented the actual credit terms
appheable to the mortgages that it would arrange or offer.

About 134,000 of the advertisements that Service Ist sentin 2018 described
mortgages with a simple imterest rate and APR combination that, on the date
of the advertisement and im the GO days preceding, Service Ist was not
actually prepared to arrange or offer.

For example, in January 2018, Service Ist advertised an adjustable-rate
mortgage with a of 2.25% introductory rate and an APR of 2.61%,

But Service [st did not offer such a loan, as reflected in the rate sheets of its
lenders. While the advertised introductory interest rate was available, the
advertised APR was not.

Accordingly, Service Ist misrepresented the actual APR for loans offered in

these advertisements.

Consumers who received the advertisements described in Paragraphs 27-30
were likely to be misled by them.

The advertisements were also likely to affect consumersâ conduct or
decisions with regard to obtamme a loan.

False and Misleading Representations
Relating to Cost Comparisons

Numerous Service Ist mortgage advertisements also contamed misleading
comparisons between hypothetical credit terms and the terms of the
advertised product.

Specifically, Service Ist sent advertisements to more than 250,000
consumers between December 2016 to January 2017 that made a
comparison between a hypothetical payment amount for the consumerâ s
current debt and an advertised payment amount for the advertised loan.
The payment amount tor the advertised loan was not available for the full
term of the loan and the advertisement did not reveal this fact.

Consumers who received the advertisements described in Paragraphs 33-35
were likely to be misled by them.

The advertisements were also likely to affect consumersâ conduct or

decisions with regard to obtaming a loan.

False and Misleading Representations About an
Affiliation with the Government

Notwithstanding that the name âService Istâ appeared in all the
advertisements, numerous Service Ist mortgage advertisements falsely
represented, directly or by implication, from various formats and phrases,
that Service Ist was affilhated with the government, including the VA, that
the advertised product was endorsed, sponsored by, or affiliated with the
United States government, or that the United States government was the
source of the advertisement. Though many of the advertisements contained a
disclaimer that Service Ist was not affiliated with a government agency, the
disclaimer was in fine print at the bottom of the advertisement or on the
second page of the advertisement.
The disclaimer was not sufficient to dispel the false net impression created
by the advertisement when viewed as a whole.
For example, each of about 3.3 million Service Ist advertisements sent to
servicemembers and veterans between December 2015 and January 2018
contained the following statements:
a. âTIRRRLâBenefit Allotmentâ or âIRRRLâ1003 Benefit Allotmentâ
positioned in the upper-left corner of the advertisement, followed by
âForm 21-0760 Eligibility Notificationâ on the second line, which

also appeared through the window of the envelope;

âImportant VA Eheibilty Informationâ in capital letters across the

While the envelopes for these maulers varied, several of these mavers were
sent in security envelopes with perforated opening mechanisms bearmeg
barcodes and the words âPersonal and Confidential.â Others arrived m
envelopes labeled âOfficial Documentation.â

These statements and other characteristics relating to the mailing strongly
mnphed that the solicitations were being sent by or on behalf of the United
States government, inchiding the VA,

Those representations were faise because Service Ist was not affihated with
the government, mcluding the VA, nor were the products offered in these
advertisements endorsed by, sponsored by, or affihated with the
government, inchiding the VA.

Consumers who received the advertisements described in Paragraphs 38-43

False and Misleading Representations
Aboutan Escrow Refund Amount

About 1.9 milion of the advertisements Service Ist sent between April
2016 and May 2017 stated that a recipient will receive an âEST. ESCROW
REPUND AMOUNTâ of aspecific amount if that consumer refinances his
or her mortgage.

The escrow refund amounts that Service Ist advertised were calculated
using a methodology that had no bearing on the actual escrow refund
amount.

Moreover, for at least the advertised cash-out refinance loans, if the
purported escrow refund was provided as cash to the borrower at the

time of the refinance, Service Ist then added it to the principal

balance of the new loan.

Consumers who received the advertisements described in Paragraphs 46â
48 were hkely to have been misled by them.

The advertisements were also likely to affect consumersâ conduct or

decisions with regard to obtaining a loan.

False Representations About Skipping Loan Payments

Service Ist sent about 900,000 advertisements between December 2015 and
Apri 2017 representing that a consumer can â[s|kip two paymentsâ or
âmissâ two payments by refmancing with the company.

For example, Service Ist sent a mailer in June 2016 advertising that if a
consumer refinanced, âthe VA would allow you to skip the payments for
July and August and receive a full escrow refund. By havinga VA loan, you
are quahfied for this program.â

But consumers had the option of âskippingâ or âmissingâ two payments
only if specific timing requirements were met. Service Ist did not disclose
this Imitation mits advertisements.

Service Ist would then add the purported âskippedâ or âmissedâ paymenis
to the principal balance of the mortgage, which it also failed to disclose in
its advertisements.

Consumers who received the advertisements described in Paragraphs 51â
54 were likely to have been misled by them.

The advertisements were also likely to affect consumersâ conduct or

decisions with regard to obtaming a loan.

False Representations About the
Time-Limited Availability of the VA-Loan Program

About 1.i milhon of the advertisements Service Ist sent stated: âthe
Economic Stimulus Program will end soon. There is currently no plan to
extend the Stimulus Program.â
This statement regarding the purported time-limited availabilty of the
VA loan program was untrue.
Consumers who received the advertisements described in Paragraphs 57
and 58 were likely to be misled by them.
The advertisements were also likely to affect consumersâ conduct or
decisions with regard to obtaming a loan.

inadequate Disclosures
Many of Service Istâs mortgage advertisements stated the amount of a new
loan payment and an introductory interest rate for adjustable mortgages.
Under certam sections of Regulation 7, mcluding Â§ 1026.24(d), and (1), the
use of these terms triggers specific disclosure requirements. About 1.6
milion of Service Istâs advertisements included these trigger terms, but did
not include the disclosures required by Â§ 1026.24(d), and about 134,000 of
its advertisements included these trigger terms, but did not include the

disclosures required by Â§ 1026.24(1).

About 250,000 of Service Istâs advertisements made a comparison between
an estimated current payment amount and an estimated new payment
amount under an advertised refinance loan, but did not include the
disclosures required by Â§ 1026.24G)(2).
In addition, about 1.8 milhon of Service Istâs mortgage advertisements
stated the name of the consumerâs current lender, but did not include the
additional disclosures required by Regulation Z in Â§ 1026.24G0)(4).
Disclosures Triggered by Payment Amount
Numerous Service Ist mortgage advertisements stated the amount of the
new loan payment, but failed to state the terms of repayment reflecting the
recipient's repayment obligations over the full term of the loan, as required
by Â§ 1026.24).
For example, Service Ist sent about 1.6 millon advertisements to consumers
stating a ânew principal and interest paymentâ reflecting a new monthly
payment amount.
But these advertisements cid not state the period of the loan or the number
of required payments. Moreover, the payment amount advertised was
applicable for only the first three or five years of the loan, but the
advertisements did not disclose the subsequent payments required over the

full term of the loan, as required by Â§ 1026.24(d\(2)Gn).

Three milion of Service Istâs advertisements also failed to disclose in a
clear and conspicuous manner the amount of each payment that would apply
over the term of the loan, the period of time during which each payment
would apply, and the fact, apphcable to these loans, that the payments did
not include amounts for taxes and insurance premiums and that the actual
payment obligation would be greater, as required by Â§ 1026.24((3).
For example, the advertisements provided the amount of the recipientâs new
monthly payment, but included neither the amount of each payment that
would apply over the life of the loan (despite it being an adjustable rate
mortgage), nor the period during which cach payment would apply.
Furthermore, the advertisements failed to disclose that the advertised
payment amounts excluded taxes and insurance and that the actual payment
obhgation would be greater.

Disclosures Triggered by Introductory Interest Rate
Numerous Service Ist mortgage advertisements offering a loan for which
more than one interest rate would apply included a simple annual rate of
interest, but failed to clearly and conspicuously state each sumple annual
mterest rate that would apply, the period of ime during which each simple
annual interest rate would apply, and for variable-rate loans, an APR that

comphes with the accuracy standards in 12 C.F.R. $$ 1026.17{c) and

1026.22, as required by Regulation Z, 12 C.FLR. Â§ 1026.24).
For example, Service ist sent about 134,000 advertisements for a variable-
rate mortgage to consumers offermg an introductory annual rate of interest
that would apply for the first three or five years of the loan, but that did not
disclose each simple interest rate that would apply over the remaining term
of the loan. These advertisements also stated the period for the introductory
rateâthree or five yearsâbut not the twenty-seven or twenty-five-year term
for the fully-indexed rate.
In addition, about 134,000 advertisements sent to consumers in January
2018 offered a mortgage with a 2.25% imtroductory interest rate that applied
to the first three years of the loan and a 2.61% APR. In fact, the lowest APR
that would have been available from Service Istâs lenders within 60 days
before any day m January 201% for the loans promoted in those
advertisements was at least 3.388%, which was not within the accuracy
standards in 8Â§ 1026.17(c) and 1026.22. While the advertised introductory
interest rate was available, the advertised APR was not.

required by Regulation 7, 12 C.FLR. Â§$ 1026.24@)(2).
Specifically, about 250,000 advertisements sent to consumers from
December 2016 to January 2017 made a comparison between the
consumerâ s estimated current payment and an estimated payment if the
consumer refinanced with the company.
The payment amount for the advertised refinance loan was not available for
the full period of the loan, but only for the first three or five years of the
loan.
The advertisements did not mclude a clear and conspicuous comparison to
each payment that would apply over the term of the loan.

Disclosures Triggered by Current Lender Name
Numerous Service Ist mortgage advertisements used the name of the
consumerâ s current lender, but failed to disclose Service Istâs name with
equal prominence, or to include a clear and conspicuous statement that
Service Ist was not associated with, or advertising on behalf of, the
consumerâs current lender, as required by Â§ 1026.24(G){4).

In some cases, Service Ist also included the name of the consumer's current
