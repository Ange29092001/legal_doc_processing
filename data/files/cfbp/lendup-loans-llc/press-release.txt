Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Settles with LendUp Loans, LLC for Military
Lending Act Violations

JAN 19, 2021

WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) filed a
proposed settlement to resolve its December 4, 2020 lawsuit against LendUp Loans, LLC
(LendUp) alleging violations of the Military Lending Act (MLA). Today's action is the first
resolution in the Bureau's broader sweep of investigations of multiple lenders that may be
violating the MLA. LendUp, which has its principal place of business in Oakland, California,
is an online lender that offers single-payment and installment loans to consumers. If entered
by the court, the proposed settlement would require LendUp to provide $300,000 in
redress to consumers and to pay a $950,000 civil money penalty. The settlement would also
enjoin LendUp from committing future violations of the MLA and from collecting on, selling,
or assigning any debts arising from loans that failed to comply with the MLA. It would also
require LendUp to correct or update the information it provided to consumer reporting
agencies about affected consumers.

The MLA puts in place protections in connection with extensions of consumer credit for
active-duty servicemembers and their dependents, who are defined as âcovered
borrowers.â These protections include a maximum allowable annual percentage rate of
36%, known as a Military Annual Percentage Rate (MAPR), a prohibition against required
arbitration, and certain mandatory loan disclosures. The Bureau's complaint, filed in the
United States District Court for the Northern District of California, alleged that since October
2016, LendUp made over 4,000 single-payment or installment loans to over 1,200 covered
borrowers in violation of the MLA. The Bureau specifically alleged that LendUpâs violations
of the MLA included extending loans with a MAPR that exceeds the MLAâs 36% cap,
extending loans that require borrowers to submit to arbitration, and failing to make certain
required loan disclosures, including a statement of the applicable MAPR.
