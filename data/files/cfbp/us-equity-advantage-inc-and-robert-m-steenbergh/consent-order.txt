In the Matter of: CONSENT ORDER

U.S. EQUITY ADVANTAGE, INC.
and ROBERT M. STEENBERGH,

 

 

The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau) has reviewed certain
acts and practices of U.S. Equity Advantage, Inc. (USEA) and Robert M.
Steen bergh (Steenbergh) (collectively Respondents) regarding their marketing for
an automobile loan Payment Accelerator Program and has identified the following
violations of the Consumer Financial Protection Act, Â§ 1031(a) and 1036(a)(1)(B);

12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531 (a), 5536(a)(1)(B):

(1) Respondents misrepresent to consumers, when disclosing individualized
benefits, the interest savings they will realize from the program.
Respondentsâ disclosures project savings for each consumer, but fail to

account for the programâs $399 enrollment fee in calculating those
savings. In fact, the programâs cost will ordinarily exceed any savings
because of the enrollment fee it charges;
(2) Respondents misrepresent to consumers the âTotal Benefitâ of the
program; and
(3) Respondents misrepresent that they have helped hundreds of thousands
of customers save $29 million or more in interest by participating in
AutoPayPlus when Respondents have no basis for making this claim, and
in fact the program has not saved consumers anywhere near that amount.
Under Sections 1053 and 1055 of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010
(CFPA), 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5563, 5565, the Bureau issues this Consent Order (Consent

Order).

IV

Bureau Findings and Conclusions

The Bureau finds the following:
USEA 1s a Florida corporation with its principal place of business at 800
North Magnolia Avenue, Suite 1275, Orlando, FL 32803.
Robert M. Steenbergh is the founder, President, Chief Executive Officer,
and ultimate owner of U.S. Equity Advantage, Inc., and he personally
directed or oversaw its practices in this matter.
Respondents, at all times material to this complaint, have collected and
transmitted consumer funds from consumers to their lenders or servicers,
activity that constitutes a consumer financial product or service covered by
the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(5), (15) (A) (iv). Respondents are both a
âcovered personâ and âservice providerâ as those terms are defined by 12
U.S.C. Â§ 5481(6) and (26).
Given his status as an officer or employee charged with managerial
responsibility for USEA, acontrolling shareholder, and a shareholder who
materially participates in the conduct of the affairs of USEA, Steenbergh is

a ârelated personâ under the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(25)(C).
10.

11.

12.

13.

Because of his status as a ârelated personâ under the CFPA, Steenbergh is
deemed a âcovered personâ under the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(25)(B).
Since November 2005, Respondents have offered a Payment Accelerator
Program called âAutoPayPlusâ (formerly called the âEquity Accelerator
Programââ).

Respondentsâ AutoPayPlus program, like many accelerator programs,
collects and applies one extra loan payment each year toward repayment of
consumerâs loans which, in theory, can substantially reduce the number of
loan payments and the interest paid over the life of the loan.

In the AutoPayPlus program, consumers authorize USEA to withdraw
portions of their regularly due car payments on an alternative schedule,
often corresponding to the consumersâ paydays.

For most of its customers, USEA makes these withdrawals bi-weekly.
USEA holds these payments, and then submits full payments to the
consumersâ lenders or other payees on the schedules set by those lenders
or payeesâusually monthly.

Because there are 52 weeks and 26 bi-weekly periods each year, USEA
withdraws the equivalent of thirteen monthly payments each year, instead

of twelve.

Respondents charge a âprogram fee,â sometimes called an âenrollment
fee,â to consumers in the AutoPayPlus program. Respondents apply a
consumerâs extra payments to this fee until it is paid in full, before
submitting any of the extra payments to the consumerâs lender.

Once Respondentsâ fees are paid, future extra payments are sent to
consumersâ lenders or payees.

During the Relevant Period, more than 100,000 consumers have enrolled
in AutoPayPlus.

Respondents enter into agreements with various auto dealerships to enroll
consumers in the AutoPayPlus program.

Those dealerships receive a commission based on the number of
consumers they enroll.

Respondents have entered into agreements to enroll customers in their
payment accelerator program with more than 900 dealerships.

Since at least July 21, 2011, Respondentsâ âprogram feeâ or âenrollment
feeâ has been $399.

Respondents charge a âconvenience feeâ or âdebit feeâ each time money is
withdrawn from consumersâ accounts, i.e., every two weeks for most

customers.
22.

23.

24.

Since January 2017, Respondentsâ âdebit feeâ or âconvenience feeâ has
been $2.45. Before January 2017, the debit fee was $1.95.

Respondents charge consumers a one-time âverification feeâ when they
process consumersâ authorization to withdraw money from their bank

accounts via Automated Clearing House withdrawals.

Since at least July 21, 2011, USEAâs âverification feeâ has been $0.95.

Findings and Conclusions as to Respondentsâ Misrepresentations Regarding

the Overall Benefits of AutoPayPlus
During the Relevant Period, Respondents provided dealerships with a web
portal or with software through which the dealerships can enroll customers
in the AutoPayPlus program.
Respondentsâ web portal and software generate customized disclosure
forms called âBi-Weekly Sales Toolsâ or âBenefits Disclosures.â
The benefits disclosures are based on individual consumersâ loan terms
and purport to describe the benefits and costs specific to individual
consumers.
Respondents instruct dealerships to provide every consumer with the
benefits disclosures to âguarantee accurate benefit disclosure.â
Respondents do not permit dealerships to change or manipulate the

benefits disclosures before presenting them to the consumer.

The disclosures purport to show potential savings after accounting for fees.
For example, the disclosures state: âCongrats! Your interest savings cover
service costs and you pocket $[ specific amount] in interest.â The
disclosures also state: âAll AutoPayPlus benefits have taken into
consideration and amortized the $399 program fee.â

Despite these representations about covering fees and taking into
consideration the enrollment fee, the costs and savings represented to
consumers in the disclosures fail to account for the $399 enrollment fee,
thereby overstating savings or understating costs to every consumer by
$399.

Section 1036(a)(1)(B) of the CFPA prohibits âunfair, deceptive, or
abusiveâ acts or practices. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(B).

Respondentsâ representations, as described in Paragraphs 25-31 constitute
deceptive acts or practices in violation of sections 103 1(a) and
1036(a)(1)(B) of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 553 1(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).

During the Relevant Period, Respondents enrolled over 100,000
consumers in AutoPayPlus. Tens of thousands of these consumers paid

the full enrollment fee on an interest-bearing loan.

Findings and Conclusions as to Respondentsâ Misrepresentations Concerning
âTotal Benefitâ

35. During the Relevant Period, Respondents state in disclosures provided to
consumers specific dollar savings amounts called the âIm proved Equityâ
and âTotal Benefit,â which refers to the reduced loan balance at a
particular time in the loan schedule.

36. But Respondents, while touting the âbenefitâ to consumers of enrolling in
AutoPayPlus in dollar terms, failed to disclose to consumers that any gain
in equity is caused by the fact that consumers are paying more money and,
in most cases, will end up having to pay more to USEA than the actual
value of the âbenefitâ to realize it.

37. Section 1036(a)(1)(B) of the CFPA prohibits âunfair, deceptive, or
abusiveâ acts or practices. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(B).

38. Respondentsâ representations, as set forth in Paragraphs 35-36, constitute
deceptive acts or practices in violation of sections 103 1(a) and
1036(a)(1)(B) of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 553 1(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).

Findings and Conclusions as to Respondentsâ Misrepresentations Concerning
Consumersâ Historical Savings from AutoPayPlus

39. During the Relevant Period, Respondents provided marketing materials,

including brochures distributed to consumers and multiple websites, which

claim that USEA has helped hundreds of thousands of customers save $29
million or more in interest.

At all times that Respondents made these claims, they did not collect or
maintain data to support the claims, or otherwise have any reasonable basis
for them.

In fact, Respondentsâ customers have not achieved $29 million in interest
savings and Respondents have not calculated the actual total consumer
interest savings.

Section 1036(a)(1)(B) of the CFPA prohibits âunfair, deceptive, or
abusiveâ acts or practices. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(B).

Respondentsâ representations, as set forth in Paragraphs 39-41, constitute
deceptive acts or practices in violation of sections 103 1(a) and

1036(a)(1)(B) of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).
