In the Matter of: CONSENT ORDER

Seterus, Inc. and
Kyanite Services, Inc., as the
successor in interest to Seterus, Inc.

 

 

The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau) has reviewed the
servicing practices of Seterus, Inc. (Seterus) relating to loss mitigation applications
and has identified the following law violations. First, Seterus has committed unfair
acts or practices by failing to accurately review, process, track, and communicate
to borrowers information regarding their applications for loss mitigation options.
Second, Seterus has committed deceptive acts or practices by sending loss
mitigation application acknowledgment notices that misrepresented the status of
borrower application documents as received or missing and provided inaccurate
due dates for submission of borrower application documents. Third, Seterus has
violated the provisions relating to loss mitigation procedures in Regulation X, 12

C.F.R. Â§ 1024.41, the implementing regulation of the 2013 Real Estate Settlement

Procedures Act (RESPA), 12 U.S.C. Â§ 2601, et seg., by (1) sending
acknowledgment notices that failed to state the additional documents and
information borrowers needed to submit to complete their loss mitigation
applications; (2) failing to provide areasonable due date for submission of
borrower documents; (3) failing to exercise reasonable diligence in obtaining
documents and information necessary to complete borrowersâ loss mitigation
applications; (4) failing to properly evaluate borrowers who submitted complete
loss mitigation applications for all loss mitigation options available to the
borrower; and (5) failing to treat certain applications as âfacially completeâ when
required under Regulation X. Fourth, because Regulation X is a Federal consumer
financial law, Seterusâs violations of Regulation X also constitute violations of the
Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA), 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1 (A).
Under Â§Â§ 1053 and 1055 of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5563, 5565, the Bureau issues

IV.
Bureau Findings and Conclusions

The Bureau finds the following:

During the Relevant Period, Seterus was a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Kyanite. Seterus maintained its principal place of business in Raleigh, North
Carolina.

As of February 28, 2019, Seterus was sold, including all rights and certain
liabilities, to Purchaser.

At its height, Seterus serviced approximately 500,000 residential mortgage
loans. Respondent has represented that it is no longer engaged in servicing
mortgage loans.

At all times during the Relevant Period, Respondent was a âcovered person,â
as that term is defined by 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(6), because as a residential

mortgage servicer, it offered or provided a consumer financial product or

service. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(15)(A)(i).
10.

Regulation X requires, among other things, that a mortgage servicer that
offers loss mitigation options implement processes that: (1) inform borrowers
of the documents and information they must provide to complete the
application; (11) provide borrowers a reasonable dateto submit the documents
and information necessary to complete the application; (111) evaluate complete
applications received early enough in the foreclosure process for all
alternatives to foreclosure available to the borrower; and (iv) provide certain
foreclosure protections to borrowers who complete an application by certain
points in the foreclosure process. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1024.41.

A servicer must provide a written notice to the borrower within five days of
receipt ofa loss mitigation application acknowledging that the servicer has
received the application and stating that the servicer has determined that the
application is either complete or incomplete. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1024.41(b)(2)(1)(B).
If the application is incomplete, this (b)(2) Notice must also inform the
borrower of the additional documents and information that the borrower must
submit anda reasonable date by which they should be submitted to make the
application complete. /d. at Â§$ 1024.41(b)(2)(1)(B), 1024.41(b)(2)(11).

Once aservicer receives all the information it requires from the borrower to
evaluatethe application, the application is âcomplete.â 12 C.F.R. Â§

1024.41(b)(1).
11.

12.

13.

2020-BCFP-0024 Document1 Filed 12/18/2020 Page 12 of 45

If a servicer receives a âcompleteâ application within certain specified time
periods before a borrowerâs scheduled foreclosure sale, the servicer must
evaluatethe borrower for all loss mitigation options available to the borrower
and must provide the borrower with certain foreclosure protections. 12 C.F.R.
Â§ 1024.41(c)(1)(G), (f(2), & (g).
If the borrower has submitted all of the documents and information requested
by the (b)(2) Notice, or the servicer does not seek additional documents in the
(b)(2) Notice, the application is âfacially complete.â 12 C.F.R.
Â§ 1024.41(c)(2)(iv). A borrower with a âfacially completeâ application is
entitledto the same protections from foreclosure actions as a borrower witha
âcompleteâ application, even iftheservicer later discovers it needs additional
information or that the borrower must make corrections to a previously
submitted document. /d.

Seterus Failed to Accurately Review, Process, Track, and

Communicate to Borrowers Information Regarding Their Applications
for Loss Mitigation.

 

 

 

As part of its efforts to comply with Regulation X, Seterus made the decision
to issue Acknowledgment Notices in response to any document received from
a consumer that may be in support of a loss mitigation application, in order to
assist the consumer in the loss mitigation process. Seterus also automated its

loss mitigation application and Acknowledgment Notice process, including its
14.

processes for tracking documents submitted by borrowers and populating and
generating the Acknowledgment Notices.

To facilitate that automation, and to try to meet the five-day requirement in 12
C.F.R. 1024.41(b)(2)(1)(B), Seterus contracted with a third-party vendorto
process all borrower documents submitted as part ofa loss mitigation
application.

Upon receipt ofa Triggering Document, the third-party vendor would
electronically capture an image of the document and âbrandâ the imaged
document by electronically tagging the document with the loan number, an
index code corresponding to the document type, a unique identifier for that
specific document, and the date the document was scanned directly on the
document and then upload the scanned document to Seterusâs internal
systems.

After uploading a Triggering Document to Seterusâs internal systems, the
third-party vendor would then electronically extract and validatethe data and
text from the image of the Triggering Document and transmit that data to
Seterusâs internal systems.

Seterusâs personnel wrote code for various computer software to ensure that
the third-party vendorâs computer system could communicate and share data

with Seterusâs internal loss mitigation and mortgage servicing computer

systems, andthat Seterusâs internal systems could communicate and share
data with one another.

Seterusâs Acknowledgment Notices provided consumers with a list of
documents Seterus had received and their expiration dates (âDocuments we
have receivedâ), anda list of documents Seterus still needed to evaluate the
application (âDocuments still neededââ).

Seterusâs Acknowledgment Notices also provided a date by which the
borrower needed to retum any missing documents and informed the borrower
that the due date provided was based on the earliest ofa set of milestones: (1)
the date on which the documents expire; (2) the 120" day of delinquency; (3)
90 days prior to the foreclosure sale date, if any; or (4) 38 days prior to the
foreclosure sale date (ifthe application was made within 90 days of a
foreclosure sale date).

Seterus populated the fields in the Acknowledgment Notice that provided the
âDocuments we have received,â âDocuments still needed,â and due dates for
documents the borrower still needed to submit using the data its third-party
vendor extracted from the documents submitted by the borrower.

Seterusâs third-party vendor made numerous errors in branding, coding and
extracting data from borrower documents, and Seterus used that inaccurate

data to populate these fields in the Acknowledgment Notice.

Further, the coding on which Seterus relied to ensure its internal systems were
communicating properly with each other and with the third-party vendorâs
system was not always correct, which led to further such errors.

As aresult of its relianceon this inaccurate data and coding and the faulty
communication between various com puter systems, Seterus sent out
thousands of Acknowledgment Notices that contained one or more errors.
Certain Acknowledgment Notices inaccurately listed documents that Seterus
had received as missing, inaccurately listed documents that had not been
received as having been received, or both. This included Acknowledgment
Notices that did not request additional documents even when required
documents were missing and Acknowledgment Notices informing borrowers
that their loss mitigation applications were âcompleteâ or âfacially completeâ
when required documents were missing.

Seterus also sent numerous Acknowledgment Notices that provided no due
date; inaccurate due dates, such as dates that were the same date or prior to the
date that the Acknowledgment Notice was sent; or unreasonable due dates,
such as dates on or after the foreclosure sale date.

Further, despite its express representations in the Acknowledgment Notices

that the due date was not after the date when previously submitted documents
27.

would expire, Seterus sent Acknowledgment Notices that provided due dates
that were after the date when previously submitted documents would expire.
The unreasonable due dates in Seterusâs Acknowledgment Notices also
rendered other statements in the Acknowledgment Notices inaccurate. For
example, in certain instances Seterus sent Acknowledgment Notices that
provided a due date that was just one or two days before the borrowerâs
scheduled foreclosure sale date. Seterus represented that as long as the
borrower provided the documents by the date indicated, he or she would be
evaluated for loss mitigation, but that representation was not always correct
when the due date was not sufficiently in advance of the scheduled foreclosure
sale date.

In other instances, the representation that the application would be evaluated if
the missing documents were submitted by the due date was inaccurate because
Seterus held foreclosure sales on the properties before the due date.
Additionally, in an effort to better assist borrowers seeking loss mitigation,
Seterus sent anew Acknowledgment Notice for each document a borrower
sent in, even though these additional Acknowledgment Notices were not
required by Regulation X. These additional Acknowledgment Notices usually

provided a new due date, which resulted in some borrowers receiving multiple

Acknowledgment Notices with different due dates on the same day, or in
quick succession, some of which were inaccurate.

Seterus discovered the systemic errors in the data provided by its third-party
vendor as early as the first quarter of 2014, and took steps to attempt to
remedy the problems, but many of those attempts were either ineffective or
compounded the problem. For example, in January 2015, Seterus instituted
manual reviews in an attempt to correct the errors in its Acknowledgment
Notices but continued to rely on incorrect data from its third-party vendor to
populate its systems and to process and track the applications. Asa result,
Seterus continued to send out Acknowledgment Notices with defects, albeit at
a significantly lower defect rate.

Further, in 2014, when Seterus first realized that some consumers had
received inaccurate Acknowledgment Notices, Seterus issued âcorrectionâ
Acknowledgment Notices. Because Seterus continued to rely on the
inaccurate datafrom its vendor to generatethem, some âcorrectionâ
Acknowledgment Notices contained the same errors as the original inaccurate
Acknowledgment Notices.

On September 4, 2014, Seterus andthe New Hampshire Banking Department
entered into a settlement related to Seterusâs inaccurate Acknowledgment

Notices.

On March 20, 2015, Seterus reported these issues to the Bureau.

Seterus continued to send out inaccurate Acknowledgment Notices containing
certain defects through April 2018, though the types and frequency of defects
declined over time.

Seterus took stepsto mitigate the harm caused by its inaccurate
Acknowledgment Notices by offering streamlined loan modifications, which
are modification offers made without requiring the borrower to submit any
hardship or income documentation, and waiving or foregoing foreclosure
deficiency judgments for certain borrowers who receiveda Defective
Acknowledgment Notice.

Seterusâs use of inaccurate data from its vendor, failureto provide accurate or
complete information about what documents Seterus had received from
consumers and what documents consumers still needed to submit to complete
their loss mitigation applications, failure to provide due dates, and provision
of incorrect or unreasonable due dates, delayed or deprived some borrowers of
a reasonable opportunity to get their loss mitigation applications completed
and evaluated, and resulted in some borrowers suffering improper foreclosure
activity because they were either delayed in obtaining or unable to obtain a

foreclosure hold.

Seterus Failed to Evaluate Borrowers Who Submitted Complete
Loss Mitigation Applications for all Loss Mitigation Options Available
to the Borrower.

 

Seterusâs Loss Mitigation department was divided into two separate divisions
â Retention and Liquidation.

Seterusâs loss mitigation policies did not allow for a borrower to be reviewed
simultaneously for both retention and liquidation options.

Borrowers who failed to indicate a preference for either retention or
liquidation, and borrowers who requested to be reviewed for both options at
the same time, were told their applications could not be reviewed until they
made their intention clear about whether or not they wanted to retain the
property.

If a borrower submitted a loss mitigation application that did not indicate a
preference for either retention or liquidation, Seterus considered the document
incomplete andthe borrower was required to resubmit the application with
only one of the two review types selected.

Borrowers who indicated a preference for retention were not reviewed for
liquidation options unless they were denied a retention option and then
subsequently requested a liquidation review, usually by submitting anew
application form requesting consideration for liquidation options. If

documents in their initial retention application had expired by thetime the
42.

46.

2020-BCFP-0024 Document1 Filed 12/18/2020 Page 20 of 45

borrower was denied a retention option, the borrower may have had to submit
updated supporting documentation in addition to new documents that Seterus
required only when evaluating a borrowerâs eligibility for a liquidation option.
Borrowers who indicated a preference for a liquidation option were not
reviewed for retention options unless they submitted a new loss mitigation
application requesting areview for retention options.

Seterus further divided its review of liquidation options between short sales
and deeds in lieu of foreclosure, and did not permit borrowers to be reviewed
simultaneously for both options.

Seterus Did Not Treat Liquidation Applications as âFacially Complete.â

Seterus did not treat loss mitigation applications seeking a liquidation option
as âfacially completeâ even when those applications met the requirements of a
âfacially completeâ application under Regulation X.
Seterusâs Violations of the Consumer Financial Protection Act,
12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531 and 5536(a)(1)(B)
The CFPA prohibits covered persons from engaging âin any unfair, deceptive,

or abusive act or practice.â 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531, 5536(a)(1)(B).

Unfair Acts and Practices

 

An act or practice is unfair if it causes or is likely to cause consumers

substantial injury that is not reasonably avoidable and ifthe substantial injury

is not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or to competition.
12 U.S.C. Â§5531(c).

As described in paragraphs 13 through 36, Seterusâs use of inaccurate data
from its third-party vendor and inaccurate com puter coding delayed or
deprived borrowers ofa reasonable opportunity to get their loss mitigation
applications completed and evaluated.

These acts or practices caused or were likely to cause substantial injury to
borrowers in the form of additional interest, late fees, and negative credit
reporting; failure to qualify for loss mitigation; and delayed protection from
prohibited foreclosure activities or an inability to obtain such protection at all.
These injuries were not reasonably avoidable by borrowers as borrowers could
not modify their loans without the assistance of Seterus.

These injuries were not outweighed by any countervailing benefits to
consumers or competition. Neither borrowers nor competition realized a
benefit from Seterusâs use of inaccurate data and coding to process, review,
track, and communicate information regarding loss mitigation applications.
Thus, during the Relevant Period, Seterus engaged in unfair acts and practices

in violation of the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(c)(1), 5536(a)(1)(B).
52.

Deceptive Acts and Practices

 

An act or practice is deceptive if it involves a material representation or
omission that misleads, or is likely to mislead, a consumer acting reasonably
under the circumstances.

As described in paragraphs 13 through 36, Seterus sent numerous
Acknowledgment Notices during the Relevant Period that misrepresented,
directly or indirectly, expressly or by implication, that: certain loss mitigation
documents had been received; certain loss mitigation documents had not been
received; the borrowerâs loss mitigation application was âcompleteâ or
âfacially completeâ; that the due date for documents that had not been
received was the date set forth in the Acknowledgment Notice, and/orthe
borrowerâs application would be reviewed and evaluated for loss mitigation if
the borrower submitted the missing documents by the due date set forth in the
Acknowledgment Notice. It was reasonable for borrowers to believe that the
information they received from their mortgage servicer regarding the status of
their loss mitigation application, the documents they needed to submit, and
due dates for those documents, was accurate.

Seterusâs Violations of Regulation X, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1024.41
Violations of 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1024.41(b)(2)

Regulation X requires a servicer to send a(b)(2) Notice within five days of
receipt ofa loss mitigation application, which informs the borrower: (1) that
the servicer has received the application; (2) that the servicer has determined
that the application is either complete or incomplete; and (3) if the application
is incomplete, what additional documents and information the borrower must
submit to make the application complete and a reasonable date by which they
should be submitted. 12 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B), 1024.41(b)(2) (ii).
As described in paragraphs 13 through 36, Seterus sent numerous purported
(b)(2) Notices that failed to accurately or completely state the additional
documents and information the borrower needed to submit to make their loss
mitigation application complete.
As described in paragraphs 13 through 36, Seterus sent numerous purported
(b)(2) Notices that failed to provide a due date, and when due dates were
provided, those due dates were often inaccurate or unreasonable.
Thus, during the Relevant Period, Seterus violated 12 C.F.R. Â§Â§

1024.41(b)(2)(i)(B), 1024.41 (b)(2)(ii).

Violations of 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1024.41(b)(1)

 

Regulation X requires servicers to exercise reasonable diligence in obtaining
documents and information to complete a loss mitigation application. 12
C.F.R. Â§ 1024.41(b)(1).

As described in paragraphs 13 through 36, Seterus sent Acknowledgment
Notices that failed to identify or incorrectly or incompletely identified the
documents and information Seterus required from the borrower to complete
their loss mitigation applications.

By sending Acknowledgment Notices that failed to accurately and completely
describe the information required to complete borrower applications, Seterus
did not exercise reasonable diligence in obtaining documents and information
necessary to complete the application.

Thus, during the Relevant Period, Seterus violated 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1024.41(b)(1).

Violations of 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1024.41(c)(1)()

 

Regulation X requires a servicer to âevaluate the borrower for all loss
mitigation options availableto the borrowerâ within 30 days, ifthe servicer
receives a âcompleteâ loss mitigation application more than 37 days before a
foreclosure sale. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1024.41(c)(1).

As described in paragraphs 37 through 43, Seterus bifurcated its loss

mitigation review and would not review borrowers for both retention and
65.

2020-BCFP-0024 Document1 Filed 12/18/2020 Page 25 of 45

liquidation options at the same time, nor would Seterus review borrowers
seeking liquidation for all available liquidation options.
Thus, during the Relevant Period, Seterus violated Â§ 12 C.F.R.
1024.41(c)(1)(i).

Violations of 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1024.41(c)(2)(v)
Regulation X provides that loss mitigation applications shall be considered
âfacially completeâ (1) when a borrower submits all the missing documents
and information as stated in the (b)(2) Notice, or (2) when no additional
documents or information are requested in the (b)(2) Notice. 12 C.F.R. Â§
1024.41(c)(2)(iv).
As described in paragraph 44, Seterus did not treat liquidation applications as
facially complete even when those applications were facially complete as
defined by 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1024.41(c)(2)(iv).
By failing to treat borrowersâ liquidation applications as facially complete,
Seterus deprived those borrowers of the protections and rights specified in 12
C.F.R. Â§ 1024.41(d), (e), (f)(2), (g), & (h).
Thus, during the Relevant Period, Seterus violated 12 C.F.R.

Â§ 1024.41(c)(2)(iv).

Seterusâs Violations of the Consumer Financial Protection Act,
12 U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(A)

70. The CFPA provides that it is unlawful for any covered person âto offer or
provide to a consumer any financial product or service not in conformity with
Federal consumer financial law, or otherwise commit any act or omission in
violation of a Federal consumer financial law.â 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(A).

71. Theterm âFederal consumer financial lawâ includes any rule prescribed by
the Bureau under an enumerated consumer law. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(14).
Regulation X is âFederal consumer financial lawâ because it is arule
prescribed by the Bureau under RESPA, which is an âenumerated consumer
law.â 12U.S.C. Â§5481(12)(M).

72. Thus, Seterusâs violations of Regulation X described in paragraphs 13 through
44 during the Relevant Period also constitute violations of the CFPA. 12
U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(A).
