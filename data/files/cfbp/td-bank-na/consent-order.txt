with that deposit-taking activity. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 3481(6)(A), (IS KA)GV), &
(ES )(AJGX).

Respondent is also a âfinancial institutionâ under EFTA and Regulation E
because it is a national bank holding consumer-deposit accounts. 15 U.S.C.
Â§ 1693a(9).

Respondent is also a Furnisher under FCRA and Regulation V because it
âfurnishes information relating to consumers to one or more consumer
reporting agencies for inclusion in a consumer report.â 12 C.PLR.

Â§ 1022.4 1(c).

Throughout the Relevant Period, Respondent has offered consumers three
overdratt options in connection with their consumer-checking accounts: (1) a
âstandardâ overdrali service, which covers transactions not subject to 12
C.F.R. Â§ 1005.17(b), including checks, automated clearing house (ACH),
and recurring debit-card transactions; (2) DCA, which covers Covered
Transactions: and (3) a âdecline allâ option, which opts the customer out of
overdraft services for all transaction types.

New customers may enroll in DCA when opening a consumer-checking
account online or at one of Respondentâs branches (stores). Existing
checking-account customers may enroll a new or existing checking account

in DCA at one of Respondentâs stores, online, or over the phone.

Respondent charges consumers who have enrolled in DCA a $35 overdraft
fee to pay, up to five times per day and at Respondentâs discretion, each
Covered Transaction that exceeds a consumerâs checking account available
balance (which accounts for pending debit transactions) by more than $5.
Respondent's consumer-checking accounts come with its âstandardâ
overdraft service, through which Respondent charges consumers a $35
overdraft fee to pay, at Respondentâs discretion, all other transactions (e.g.,
checks, ACH, and recurring debits) that exceed a consumerâs checking
account available balance by more than $5.

Consumers who have enrolled in DCA receive overdraft coverage on
transactions not subject to 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1005.17(b) through Respondentâs
âstandardâ overdrali service, not through their enroliment in DCA.

Findings and Conclusions as to Respondentâs DCA Enrollment
Process in Respondentâs Stores in Violation of LFTA and Regulation E

Under Respondentâs store enrollment procedures, Respondentâs store
employees orally present DCA to new customers who are opening
consumer-checking accounts and request those new customers to orally
indicate whether they want to enroll following that presentation.
Respondentâs store employees then document the new customer's oral

enrollment preference in Respondentâs account-opening computer system.

Under Respondentâs store enrollment procedures, Respondentâs store
employees do not print and present new customers with a written overdraft
notice (DCA Form) until the end of the account-opening process.

The printed DCA Form that Respondentâs store employces present to new
customers is pre-marked with a checked box to reflect the customerâs oral
enrollment preference from earlier in the account-opening process.
Respondentâs employees print the Form with the âEnrolled in TD Debit
Card Advanceâ option selected for consumers who stated they want DCA.
Respondent prints the Form with the âNot Enrolled tn TD Debit Card
Advanceâ option selected for consumers who stated they did not want DCA.
Under Respondentâs store procedures, through December 31, 2018, new
customers did not receive written disclosures about Respondentâs overdraft
services before receiving the DCA Form at the end of the account-opening
process.

Respondentâs store employees present this DCA Form together with
Respondentâs account-opening authorization form. New customers must
sign both forms to complete the account-opening process.

The DCA Form and account-opening authorization form are pre-filled by
Respondentâs computer system with all relevant customer and account

information.

Since January 27, 2014, it has been Respondentâs policy that a new customer
must sign both a DCA Form indicating whether the customer is enrolling
and an account-opening authorization form in order to open a consumer-
checking account regardless of whether the customer enrolls in DCA.

Under Regulation E, a financial institution may not charge Covered
Overdraft Fees untess it first â[o]btains the consumerâs affirmative consent,
or opt-in, to the institutionâs payment of ATM or one-time debit card
transactions.â 12 C.F.R. 8 1005.17(b) 1).

A financial institution must provide a consumer with the written (or, if the
consumer agrees, electronic) notice required by 12 CLFLR. Â§ 1005.17(b)( DG)
before it can obtain that consumerâs affirmative consent as required by 12
C.F.R. 8 1005.17(bC GiÂ».

As described in paragraphs 14-18 above, through December 31, 2018,
Respondent requested that new customers orally provide their DCA
enrollment preference before providing them with written notice describing
the DCA service.

Respondent does not obtain a new customerâs affirmative consent to enroll
in DCA through the customerâs oral enrollment preference when Respondent
obtains that oral decision before providing the customer the written notice

required by 12 C.FLR. Â§ 1003.17()C)G).

Under Respondentâs store procedures, Respondent prints the DCA Form
with a pre-checked box indicating the new customer's DCA enrollment
decision and presents that Form to the new customer at the end of the
account-opening process.

By the time Respondent provides new customers with a single DCA Form
for their signature in Respondentâs stores, the DCA Form is already marked
with their enrollment preference.

[f new customers who previously indicated that they wished to enroll want
io amend their enroliment preference after receiving the printed DCA Form,
they must affirmatively seek a different version of the DCA Form without
their previous enroliment preference pre-marked.,

Respondent does not obtain a new customerâs affirmative consent to enroll
in DCA through the customerâs signature on a DCA Form that is already
marked with the customer's enrollment preference and that all new
customers are required to sign to open a consumer-checking account.
During the Relevant Period, Respondent charged approximately 1.42 milhon
Affected Consumers Covered Overdraft Fees.

As a result, Respondent charged Covered Overdraft Fees without obtaining
consumersâ affirmative consent to enroll in DCA, in violation of EFTA, 15

U.S.C. Â§ 1693 et seq., and Regulation E, 12 C.P.R. Â§ 1005.1 7(b)C1 Ma).

Findings and Conclusions as te KRespondentâs DCA Enrollment Process at
Offsite Account-Opening Events in Violation of EF TA and Regulation

Respondentâs employees also open consumer-checking accounts at events
held outside of Respondent's stores, including at local colleges or
businesses.

For these offsite account-opening events, Respondent uses a different
account-opening authorization form that consumers must sign to open a new
checking account.

Respondentâs offsite account-opening authorization form features a box to
check to enroll in DCA, along with additional customer-information fields
and certain terms and conditions for Respondentâs checking accounts. This
form does not disclose any information regarding DCA.

For offsite account-opening events, Respondent's employees are also
required to bring DCA Forms for all new customers to sign.

But before early 2015, Respondentâs employees often did not bring the DCA
Form to offsite account-opening events.

Even after early 2015, Respondentâs employees in some cases still failed to
bring the DCA Form to offsite account-opening events.

When Respondentâs employees failed to bring the DCA Form to offsite
account-opening events, Respondent still opened consumer-checking

accounts and enrolled new customers in DCA following those events.

When Respondentâs employees failed to bring the DCA Form to offsite
account-opening events, Respondent obtained consumersâ DCA enrollment
decisions without providing customers with the DCA Form for their
signature and before providing them with any written disclosure describing
DCA.

In early 2015, Respondent instructed employees at offsite account-opening
events to elicit an oral enrollment preference from a new customer and then
to fill out the DCA Form on behalf of the new customer-ââincluding marking
the new customer's DCA enroliment preferenceâbetore later providing the
customer the DCA Form for their signature.

Following offsite account-opening events, Respondentâs employees use the
consumer information captured in the offsite account-opening form and
DCA Form to open new checking accounts for the new customers who
attended those events.

Under Regulation E, a financial institution may not charge Covered
Overdratt Fees unless it first â[o[btains the consumerâs affirmative consent,

A financial institution must provide a consumer with the notice required by
12 C.FLR. Â§ 1005.17(b)(1)G) before it can obtain that consumerâs affirmative
consent as required by 12 C.PF.R. $ 1005.170b)C1 Ga).

Respondent instructed its employees to fill out DCA Forms on behalf of new
customers at offsite account-opening eventsâincluding marking a new
customerâs oral DCA enroliment preferenceâbetore presenting the DCA
Form to new customers for their signature.

Respondent does not obtain a new customerâs affirmative consent to enroll
in DCA through the customerâs oral enrollment preference, because
Respondent does not provide the customer the written notice required by 12
C.F.R. 8 1005.17(>) 1G) before obtaining that oral decision.

Respondent directed its employees to complete the DCA Form with the
customerâs information and selected enrollment option. This meant that by
the time Respondent's emplovees presented new customers with a DCA
Form for their signature at offsite account-opening events, that DCA Form
had been marked with their enrollment preference.

Respondent does not obtain a new customerâs affirmative consent to enroll
in DCA through the customerâs signature on a DCA Form that is already
marked with the customerâs enrollment preference and that all new

customers are required to sign to open a consumer-checking account.

Respondentâs employees also failed to bring DCA Forms to offsite account-
opening events to present to new customers for their signature, but still
enrolled customers in DCA at these events.

When Respondentâs employees failed to bring DCA Forms to offsite
account-opening events, they obtained new customersâ DCA enrollment
decisions without providing them with Respondentâs DCA Form for their
signature and before providing them with any other written disclosure
describing DCA.

Respondent charged new customers who enrolled in DCA at offsite account-
opening events Covered Overdraft Fees.

As aresult, Respondent charged Covered Overdraft Fees without obtaining
these consumersâ affirmative consent to enroll in DCA, in violation of
EFTA, 15 U.S.C. 1693 et seq., and Regulation E, 12 C.FLR. Â§

Findings and Conclusions as to Respondentâs Abusive Acts or Practices
During the DCA Enrolbment Process in Respondentâs Stores and at Offsite

request that new customers orally indicate whether they want to enroll in
DCA, based upon the employeeâs oral presentation of the service, before

Respondent did not create a script for store employees to use to present DCA
to new customers before requesting their oral enrollment decision.
Respondent's managers created their own talking points and scripts tor
Respondent's employees to use to explain DCA to new checking-account
customers in the stores they supervised.

Respondentâs managers instructed employees, for their oral presentation of
DCA to new customers, to: (1) present DCA as a âfreeâ service or benefit,
while downplaying the tees and disclosures associated with the service; and
(2) frame DCA as a âfeatureâ or âpackageâ that âcomes withâ all new
consumer-checking accounts, rather than as an option that new customers
must opt in to.

In fact, (1) DCA is not a âfreeâ service or benefit; and (2) DCA is not a
âfeatureâ of Respondentâs checking accounts and does not âcome withâ all
new consumer-checking accounts.

In some cases during the store and offsite account-opening process,
Respondent also represented, expressly or by implication, that: (1) enrolling
in DCA would allow Respondent to pay transactions-âincluding a morigage
or light bill-âlikely already covered by Respondent's standard overdraft
service; and (2) enroliment in DCA is a default setting required to open a

new consumer-checking account.

In fact, (1) DCA pays Covered Transactions only, while remaining
transactions are covered by Respondentâs standard overdraft service; and (2)
Respondent does not offer a consumer-checking account for which
enrollment in DCA is required.

Under Respondentâs procedures, Respondentâs employees do not provide
new customers with a DCA Form for their signature until the end of the
account-opening process.

The DCA Form that Respondentâs employees present to new customers in
Respondentâs stores and at offsite account-opening events features a pre-
checked box reflecting the customerâs oral enroliment preference from
earlier in the account-opening process.

Respondentâs employees do not print and present new customers with a

Through a misleading or incomplete oral presentation of the DCA service
for the purpose of eliciting an oral-enrollment decision, and then by not
providing new customers with the pre-marked DCA Form until the end of
the account-opening process, or not providing the DCA Form at all,
Respondent materially interfered with consumersâ ability to understand the
terms and conditions of DCA.

In certain instances, Respondentâs employees further materially mtertered
with consumersâ ability to understand the terms and conditions of DCA by:
requiring new customers to sign DCA Forms with the âenrolledâ option pre-
checked without mentioning the DCA service at ail; enrolling new
customers in DCA without requesting the customerâs oral enroliment
decision; and deliberately obscuring, or attempting to obscure, the DCA
Form to prevent a new customer's review of their pre-marked âenrolledâ
Status.

Section LO36(a\1)(B) of the CFPA prohibits abusive acts or practices. 12
ULS.C. 8 3536(a\ 1B).

An act or practice is abusive under the CFPA if it, among other things,
âmaterially interferes with the ability of a consumer to understand a term or
condition of a consumer financial product or service.â 12 U.S.C,

Â§ 5531(d\(1).

Respondentâs conduct constitutes abusive acts or practices in violation of the

Account-Opening Process
Section 1036(a\(1)(B) of the CFPA prohibits deceptive acts or practices. 12
ULS.C. 8 3536(a)C1 (8).
As described in Paragraph 54, in connection with the marketing, promoting,
offering for sale, or sale of DCA, in numerous instances, Respondent
represented, expressly or tmpliedly, that: (1) DCA is a âtreeâ service or
benefit; and (2) DCA ts a âfeatureâ or âpackageâ that âcomes withâ all new
consumer-checking accounts.
In fact, (1) DCA is not a âfreeâ service or benefit; and (2) DCA is not a
âfeatureâ of Respondentâs checking accounts and does not âcome withâ all
new consumer-checking accounts.
Further, as described in Paragraph 56, in connection with the marketing,
promoting, offering for sale, or sale of DCA, Respondent represented,
expressly or impliedly, that: (1) enrolling in DCA would allow Respondent
to pay transactionsâincluding a mortgage or light billâlikely already
covered by Respondentâs standard overdraft service; and (2) enrollment in

DCA is a default setting required to open a new consumer-checking account.

74.

70,

In fact, (1) DCA pays Covered Transactions only, while remaining
transactions are covered by Respondentâs standard overdraft service; and (2)
Respondent does not offer a consumer-checking account for which
enrollment in DCA ts required. A consumer-checking account does not
include DCA unless a consumer chooses to enroll in DCA.

Thus, Respondentâs representations, as described in Paragraphs 69 and 71
constitute deceptive acts or practices in violation of sections 103 1(a) and

1036(a)(1)\(B) of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. 88 5531 (a), 5536(a)C1)(B).

Findings and Conclusions as to Respondentâs Deceptive Acts or Practices

When Presenting DCA to Existing Customers by Phone
Respondent permits consumers who have a checking account with
Respondent to enroll a new or existing checking account in DCA over the
phone.

For existing checking-account customers enrolling in DCA over the phone,
Respondent requires its employees to read (or play an automated version of)
a scripted disclosure regarding overdraft fees and the transactions covered
by DCA when obtaining a consumerâs enrollment decision.

During phone enroliments, tn certain instances, Respondentâs employees
represented that DCA covers check transactions, mortgage payments, car
payments, utility bills, and other recurring-bill payments, rather than only

Covered Transactions.

But enroliment in DCA is not required to cover check transactions, utility
bills, or other recurring bull payments. Respondentâs standard overdraft
service covers those transactions.

On other calls, Respondentâs phone employees stated that DCA takes effect
on the date of enrollment, including to a consumer who wished to use the
service immediately, and implied that enrolling in DCA would allow
customers to exceed Respondentâs daily ATM withdrawal limit of $750
while incurring only one Covered Overdratt Fee.

But DCA takes effect the next business day following enrollment. And
enrollment does not allow a consumer to exceed Respondentâs daily $750
ATM withdrawal limit. Consumers enrolled in DCA are still subject to
Respondentâs $750 ATM withdrawal limit, and would incur multiple
Covered Overdratt Fees if withdrawing more than that amount.

Section 1036(a\1)(B) of the CFPA prohibits deceptive acts or practices. 12
ULS.C. 8 3536(a)C1 (8).

As described in Paragraph 76, in connection with the marketing, promoting,
offering for sale, or sale of DCA, in certain instances, Respondent has
represented, expressly or impliedly, that DCA covers check transactions,
mortgage payments, car payments, utility bills, and other recurring-~bill

payments.

In fact, Respondentâs standard overdraft service covers those transactions.
DCA enrollment is only required for Respondent to pay Covered
Transactions.

As described in Paragraph 78, in connection with the marketing, promoting,
offering for sale, or sale of DCA, in certain instances, Respondent has
represented, expressly or impliedly, that: (1) DCA takes effect the date of
enrollment, and (2) enrolling in DCA would allow customers to exceed
Respondentâs daily ATM withdrawal limit of $750 while incurring only one
Covered Overdraft Fee.

In fact, (1) DCA takes effect the next business day following enroliment,
and (2) consumers would incur multiple Covered Overdraft Fees if
withdrawing more than Respondentâs $750 ATM withdrawal limit.

Thus, Respondentâs representations, as described in Paragraphs 81 and 83,
constitute deceptive acts or practices in violation of $$ LO31(a) and

1036(a}\(1)(B) of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531 (a), 5536(a)C\(B).

Findings and Conclusions as to Respondentâs Deceptive Acts or Practices

When Marketing DCA to Existing Customers by Mail
Until April 2016, Respondent used targeted mail marketing to solictt
existing customers who had previously declined to enroll in DCA and who
recently had a check returned for insufficient funds or a debit card that was

declined.

In those marketing mailers, Respondent advertised DCA as âallowling]â
Respondent âto cover all types of transactions, including ATM, one-time
debil card transactions, checks, automatic bill payments, online banking
transfers, and payments through bill pay, at our discretion.â

Consumers who enroll in DCA receive coverage on checks, automatic bill
payments, online banking transfers, or payments through bill pay through
Respondentâs standard overdralt service, not through their enrollment in
DCA,

In the same marketing mailer, Respondent described its standard overdraft
service as covering â|cjhecks and recurring items onlyâ and as covering
âchecks and recurring payments, such as mortgage payments or monthly
utility bills}...

Transactions such as âonline banking transfersâ and âpayments through bill
pay.â which Respondent presented as being âcoverjed]? by DCA but not
Respondent's standard overdratt service, are in fact covered by
Respondentâs standard overdralt service.

Respondentâs description of its standard overdraft service in its marketing
matier did not list transactions such as âonline banking transfersâ and

âpayments through bill pay.â

Section 1036(a)(1)CB) of the CFPA prohibits deceptive acts or practices. 12
U.S.C. Â§ $536(a)(1)(B).

As described in Paragraph 87, in connection with the advertising, marketing,
promoting, offering for sale, or sale of DCA, in numerous instances
Respondent has represented, expressly or impliedly, that DCA covers
checks, automatic bill payments, online banking transfers, and payments
through bill pay.

In fact, enrollment in DCA is required to cover Covered Transactions only.
Thus, Respondent's representations, as described in Paragraph 93, constitute
deceptive acts or practices in violation of $$ 1031(a) and 1036(a)(1)(B) of

the CFPA, 12 ULS.C. 88 553 1a), 5536(a)( 1B).

Findings and Conclusions as to Respondentâs NSCRA Furnishing Practices in

96,

97.

Violation of Regulation V and FCRA
Throughout the Relevant Period Respondent has furnished consumer-
deposit-account information to two NSCRAs.
Respondent did not establish and implement policies or procedures
concerning the accuracy and integrity of the information tt furnished to those
two NSCRAs until it implemented a furnishing policy relating to one of the

NSCRAs in July 2016.
OS.

OF,

100.

LOL.

102.

Respondent also failed to implement policies or procedures for handling
NSCRA furnishing disputes until it implemented a policy relating to one of
the NSCRAs in August 2016.

Respondent did not implement a policy or procedure for investigating
disputes relating to furnishing information to the second NSCRA until April
2017.

Before at least June 2016, Respondent instructed consumers who called to
dispute information Respondent had furnished to at least one NSCRA to
contact the NSCRA, rather than to submit a Direct Dispute to Respondent.
Section 1022.42(a) of Regulation V, the implementing regulation of FCRA,
15 U.S.C. Â§ 1681, et seq., requires a Furnisher to establish and implement
reasonable written policies and procedures regarding the accuracy and
integrity of the consumer information that it furnishes to a Consumer
Reporting Agency, and further provides that the policies and procedures
must be appropriate to the nature, size, complexity, and scope of each
Furnisherâs activities. 12 C.P.R. Â§ 1022.42(a).

Through at least mid-2016, given the size, complexity, and scope of
Respondentâs furnishing activities, Respondent failed to establish or

implement reasonable written policies and procedures regarding the

accuracy and integrity of the consumer information that it furnished to
NSCRAs, in violation of Regulation V. 12 C.PLR. Â§ 1022.42(a).

Section 1022.42(b) of Regulation V requires that Furnishers consider
guidelines in Appendix E of the Furnisher Rule in developing appropriate
policies and procedures, and incorporate them where appropriate. 12 C.F.R.
Â§ 1022.42(b).

Appendix E of the Furnisher Rule includes guidelines for furnishing policies

and procedures that are reasonably designed to promote, among other things:

verifying random samples of information provided to consumer-reporting
agencies; conducting a periodic evaluation of a Furnisherâs own practices,
investigations of disputed information, and corrections of inaccurate
information; and maintaining records for a reasonable period in order to
substantiate the accuracy of any information about consumers it furnishes
that is subject to a Direct Dispute. Appendix FE to 12 C.F UR. Part 1022.
Through at least mid-2016, Respondent also failed to incorporate certain
elements in Appendix E, as appropriate, in its policies and procedures
governing NSCRA furnishing, in violation of Regulation V. 12 C.FLR.

Â§ 1022.42(b).

27
107,

108.

109.

110.

During the Relevant Period, in certain cases, Respondent also failed to
complete its investigations, reviews, and reports, including reporting the
results of its investigation to an NSCRA, stemming from indirect disputes
concerning consumer information Respondent had furnished to one NSCRA
within 30 days or 45 days.

Respondent is unable to provide evidence of timely investigations of the vast
majority of indirect disputes concerning NSCRA furnishing that it received
prior to mid-2016.

After mid-2016, Respondent failed to investigate some indirect disputes
concerning information Respondent had furnished to one NSCRA within 30
days.

Section 623(b)(2) of FCRA requires a Furnisher to complete ail
investigations, reviews, and reports, including reporting the results of its
investigations to Consumer Reporting Agencies, stemming from an indirect
dispute concerning the completeness or accuracy of information furnished to
a Consumer Reporting Agency within 30 days. 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1681s-2(b)(Q).
The 30-day period may be extended for up to 15 additional days if the
Consumer Reporting Agency receives information from the consumer
during that 30-day period that is relevant to the reinvestigation. 15 U.S.C.

Â§ 1681s-2(b)(2); see alsa id. Â§ 1681i(a)y(1(B}.

Because Respondent failed to complete its investigations of indirect disputes
concerning information Respondent had furnished to an NSCRA within 30,
or when applicable, 45 days, Respondent violated Â§ 623(b)(2) of the FCRA,
15 ULS.C. Â§ 1681s-2(b)(2).

Order to Pay Civil Money Penalty

fT iS FURTHER ORDERED that:

Under Â§ 1055(c) of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5565(c), by reason of the

violations of law described in Section [V of this Consent Order, and taking

pate account the factors in 12 U.S.C. Â§ 35565(c)(3), Respondent must pay a

civil money penalty of $25 million to the Bureau.

Within ten days of the Effective Date, Respondent must pay the civil money

penalty by wire transfer to the Bureau or to the Bureauâs agent in

compliance with the Bureauâs wiring instructions.

The civil money penalty paid under this Consent Order will be deposited in

the Civil Penalty Fund of the Bureau as required by Â§ 1017(d) of the CFPA,

IZUS.C. Â§ 5497(d).

Respondent, for all purposes, must treat the civil money penalty paid under

this Consent Order as a penalty paid to the government. Regardless of how

the Bureau ultimately uses those funds, Respondent may not:

a. Claim, assert, or apply for a tax deduction, tax credit, or any other tax
benefit for any civil money penalty paid under this Consent Order; or

b. Seek or accept, directly or indirectly, reimbursement or indemnification

from any source, including but not limited to payment made under any

4}
132.

tasurance policy, with regard to any civil money penalty paid under this

Consent Order.
To preserve the deterrent effect of the civil money penalty in any Related
Consumer Action, Respondent may not argue that Respondent is entitled to,
nor may Respondent benefit by, any offset or reduction of any compensatory
monetary remedies imposed in the Related Consumer Action because of the
civil money penalty paid in this action or because of any payment that the
Bureau makes trom the Civil Penalty Fund. If the court in any Related
Consumer Action offsets or otherwise reduces the amount of compensatory
monetary remedies imposed against Respondent based on the civil money
penalty paid in this action or based on any payment that the Bureau makes
from the Civil Penalty Fund, Respondent must, within 30 days after entry of
a final order granting such olfset or reduction, notify the Bureau, and pay the
amount of the offset or reduction to the U.S. Treasury. Such a payment will
not be considered an additional civil money penalty and will not change the
amount of the civil money penalty imposed in this action.

Additional Monetary Provisions

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that:

42
In the event of any default on Respondentâs obligations to make payment
under this Consent Order, interest, computed under 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1961, as
amended, will accrue on any outstanding amounts not paid from the date of
default to the date of payment, and will immediately become due and
payable.
Respondent must relinquish all dominion, control, and title to the funds paid
to the fullest extent permitted by law and no part of the funds may be
returned to Respondent.
Under 31 U.S.C. Â§ 7701, Respondent, unless it already has done so, must
furnish to the Bureau its taxpayer-identifying numbers, which may be used
for purposes of collecting and reporting on any delinquent amount arising
out of this Consent Order.
Within 30 days of the entry of a final judgment, consent order, or settlement
ina Related Consumer Action, Respondent must notify the Regional
Director of the final judgment, consent order, or settlement in writing. That
notification must indicate the amount of redress, if any, that Respondent paid
or is required to pay to consumers and describe the consumers or classes of
consumers to whom that redress has been or will be paid.
