Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Sues Debt Collector BounceBack, Inc.

DEC 09, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. â- Today, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) filed a
lawsuit against BounceBack, Inc. for allegedly engaging in deceptive and otherwise
unlawful debt collection acts or practices. BounceBack, based in Kansas City, Missouri,
operates bad-check pretrial-diversion programs on behalf of more than 90 district
attorneysâ offices throughout the United States. The Bureau alleges that in the course of
implementing this program, BounceBack violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act
(FDCPA) and the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA). The Bureauâs
complaint seeks injunctions against BounceBack, as well as damages, redress to consumers,
disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, and the imposition of a civil money penalty.

The Bureau filed its complaint in federal court in the Western District of Missouri. The
complaint alleges that since at least 2015, in the course of administering these bad-check
pretrial-diversion programs, BounceBack used district-attorney letterheads to threaten
more than 19,000 consumers with prosecution if they did not pay the amount of the check,
enroll and pay for a financial-education course, and pay various other fees. BounceBack did
not reveal to consumers that BounceBackâand not district attorneysâsent the letters. Nor
did BounceBack reveal that district attorneys almost never prosecuted these cases, even
when consumers ignored BounceBackâs threats. In fact, in most cases, BounceBack did not
refer cases for prosecution, even if the check writer failed to respond to its collection letter.
BounceBackâs letters also failed to include disclosures required under the FDCPA. The
Bureau alleges that BounceBackâs conduct violated the FDCPA, was deceptive under both
the FDCPA and the CFPA, and that its violations of the FDCPA constituted violations of the
CFPA.

The complaint is not a finding or ruling that the defendant has violated the law.
