34. Settling Defendants and Relief Defendants relinquish all dominion,
control, title to the funds paid under this Order to the fullest extent permitted by
law. No part of the funds may be returned to Settling Defendants or Relief
Defendants.

35. The facts alleged in the Complaint will be taken as true and be
given collateral estoppel effect, without further proof, in any proceeding based
on the entry of the Order, or in any subsequent civil litigation by, or on behalf
of the Bureau, including in a proceeding to enforce its rights to any payment or
monetary judgment under this Order, such as a nondischargeability complaint in
any bankruptcy case.

36. The facts alleged in the Complaint establish all elements necessary
to sustain an action by the Bureau under to Section 523(a)(2)(A) of the
Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. Â§ 523(a)(2)(A). For such purposes, this Order will
have collateral estoppel effect against each Settling Defendant, even in such
Settling Defendantâs capacity as debtor-in-possession.

37. Under 31 U.S.C. Â§ 7701, Settling Defendants and Relief

settlement in a Related Consumer Action, Settling Defendants and Relief
Defendants must notify the Enforcement Director of the final judgment, order,
or settlement in writing. That notification must indicate the amount of redress,
if any, that Settling Defendants and Relief Defendants paid or are required to
pay to consumers, and it must describe the consumers or classes of consumers
to whom that redress has been or will be paid. To preserve the deterrent effect

of the civil money penalty in any Related Consumer Action, Settling

Defendants and Relief Defendants may not argue that any Settling Defendant or
Relief Defendant is entitled to, nor may any Settling Defendant or Relief
Defendant benefit by, any offset or reduction of any monetary remedies
imposed in the Related Consumer Action because of the civil money penalties
paid in this action, or because of any payment that the Bureau makes from the
Civil Penalty Fund. If the court in any Related Consumer Action offsets or
otherwise reduces the amount of compensatory monetary remedies imposed
against any Settling Defendant and Relief Defendant based on the civil money
penalty paid in this action, or based on any payment that the Bureau makes
from the Civil Penalty Fund, such Settling Defendant or Relief Defendant must,
within 30 days after entry of a final order granting such offset or reduction,
notify the Bureau and pay the amount of the offset or reduction to the U.S.
Treasury. Such a payment will not be considered an additional civil money
penalty and will not change the amount of the civil money penalty imposed in
this action.

39. Under Section 604(a)(1) of FCRA, 15 U.S.C.Â§ 1681 b(a)(1), any
Consumer Reporting Agency may furnish a Consumer Report concerning any

purposes of collecting and reporting on any delinquent amount arising out of
this Order.
