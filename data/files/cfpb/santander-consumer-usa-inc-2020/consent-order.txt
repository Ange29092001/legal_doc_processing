Bureau Findings and Conclusions

The Bureau findsthe following:

4. Respondent is aspecialized consumer finance company headquartered
in Fort Worth, Texas. [ts primary business is the indirect origmation of retail
installment contracts and vehicle leases through manufacturer-atfiliated dealers or
large, independent dealers. In 2019, Respondent reported $31.3 billion in
originations across vehicle retail installment contracts and leases, and it reported
$994 million in net income.

5.  Respondentis aâcovered personâ under 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481{6).

6. Respondent fumishes consumer credit information to CRAs and is
therefore subject to the FCRA and Regulation V. 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1681 et seq.; 12
C.F.R. pt. 1022.

7. Respondent furnishes consumer information onthe vehicle retail
installment contracts and leases it services by sending monthly data files to CRAs
using a data format called Metro 2. Each line of consumer data relating to one
individual credit account is commonly known as a tradeline, and each tradeline can
be composed of more than 40 data fields, such as the consumerâs name, thetype of

account, andthe status ofthe account.

Findings and Conclusions as to Respondentâs Furnishing of Information
That It Knew or Had Reasonable Cause to Believe Was Inaccurate

8. From at least January 2016 to at least August 2019, Respondent
furnished consumer information to CRAs that contained systemic errors. In many
instances, the errors should have been readily apparent because the data for certain

accounts was internally inconsistent.

9. | Moreover, Respondent received error reports from at least one CRA
that described these errors in the companyâs data files. In addition, Respondentâs
internal audits show that it was aware of at least one of these errors as of 2016.
Despite being on notice of these errors, Respondent continued to make them for

years.

10. Several of Respondentâs errors related to its use of the Date of First

Delinquency (DOFD) field in its furnishing data.

11. Section 605(a)(5) ofthe FCRA requires that negative information
such as late payments must be removed from a consumerâs credit report afterthat
information is seven years old. 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1681(a)(5). The date by which such
information must be removed is determined by the date on which the account first
became delinquentâthe âdate of first delinquency.â This provision allows

consumers to rebuild their credit following a long period of delinquency.
2020-BCFP-0027 Document1 Filed 12/22/2020 Page 6 of 31

Reporting an Incorrect Date of First Delinquency

 

12. Inmore than 23 million instances between January 2016 and August
2019, or 35 percent of all instances when Respondent furnished a DOFD during
this time period, the DOFD furnished by Respondent equaled the Date of Account
Information (DOAI) for the account. The DOAT is the date on which Respondent

pulled information from its system of record each month in order to sendto CRAs.

13. When fumishing in the Metro 2 format, furnishers like Respondent
must provide the DOAI so that date is updated each month until the company stops
reporting on atradeline. Even ifthe DOFD did equal the DOAT at one point fora
particular account, it is extremely unlikely that the DOFD would equal the DOAI

for two or more months.

14. A CRA informed Respondent that it was reporting DOFDs that were
more recent than previously reported DOFDs on derogatory accounts --an error
that couldresult from usingthe DOAI in the DOFD field. Respondent received
these reports from January 2015 through June 2016 and again in December 2017

and early 2019.

15. In morethan 22 million instances when Respondent reported a DOFD
that equaled the DOAI, the company also reported that the accounts were current.

DOFD should not typically be reported for current accounts. Respondent knew
2020-BCFP-0027 Document1 Filed 12/22/2020 Page 7 of 31

about this issue since at least September 2016, when an internal audit showed that
the company reported DOFDs on current accounts. In November 2016, another

internal audit showed thesame error.

16. Inalmost 450,000 ofthe instances when Respondentreported a
DOFD that equaled the DOAI, the com pany also reported an account status
showing a serious delinquency (e.g., account was charged-off or at least 90 days
delinquent, or the vehicle was already repossessed). The DOAI is typically close in
time to the date of furnishing because account information is ordinarily pulled for
furnishing purposes shortly before it is transmitted to CRAs. By contrast, it would
be extremely unusual to have a DOFD close to the date of furnishing on a seriously

delinquent account.
Reporting a Date of First Delinquency for Accounts that Were Not Delinquent

17. In at least an additional 890,700 instances between January 2016 and
August 2019, Respondent reported a DOFD at the same time it reported
contradictory information suggesting that the accounts in question were not in fact
delinquent. Respondent should not havereported DOFDs for accounts that were
current, paid in full (and not delinquent immediately beforehand), or previously
delinquent but subsequently became current. If, on the other hand, the DOFD was
accurate and the accounts referenced above were delinquent, then Respondent

should not have reported them as current, paid in full, or cured. Either way,

7
2020-BCFP-0027 Document1 Filed 12/22/2020 Page 8 of 31

Respondent fumished incorrect information for each of these tradelines.

Reporting Other Types of Inaccurate Information

 

18. Respondent also furnished inconsistent information regarding whether
accounts were open or closed and whether consumers were carrying a balance or
obligated to make future payments. To the extent that the com pany inaccurately
reported whether accounts were open or closed or that consumers owed money that
they did not actually owe, these errors could have negatively impacted consumersâ

credit scores and access to credit.

19. For example, in at least 367,070 instances between January 2016 and
August 2019, Respondent furnished information indicating that accounts were
âpaid in full, charged off,â along with contradictory information suggesting the
tradelines were still open. The company received error reports from a CRA
highlighting this inconsistency from January 2015 through June 2016 and again in

December 2017 and early 2019.

20. Respondent also reported in approximately 250,000 instances that
accounts had a current balance and simultaneously furnished contradictory
information, such as also furnishing information indicating that the accounts were
paid in full. The company had received error reports from a CRA since January

2015 advising of this error.

21. Priorto June 2017, Respondent did not consistently, for all tts retail
installment contract and lease portfolios, clearly and conspicuously specify to
consumers an address where consumers could notify the com pany that information

the company furnished was inaccurate.

22. Section 623(a)(1 (A) of FCRA prohibits a furnisher from fumishing
any information relatmeg to a consumer to any CRA if it knows or has reasonable

cause to believe that the information 1s inaccurate. 15 U.S.C.$ 1681s-2(a)C1 WA).

23. Innumerous instances, Respondent fumished consumer credit
information to CRAs that contained inaccurate information about consumersâ
credit accounts.

24. Inmany instances, Respondent knew or had reasonable cause to
believe that the information was inaccurate because this information was internally
inconsistent. In many other instances, the company furnished a DOFD that equaled
the DOAT, which was extremely unlikely to be accurate for tradelines furnished
over multiple months for multiple accounts. Moreover, the company continued to
furnish this inaccurate information even alterit had been notified about these types
of errors by CRAs.

25. Therefore, priorto June 2017, Respondent violated Â§ 623(a)(1 (A) of

the FCRA, 15 U.S.C.$ 1681s-2(a)C1 (A).

o
2020-BCFP-0027 Document1 Filed 12/22/2020 Page 10 of 31

Findings and Conclusions as to Respondentâs Failure to
Promptly Update and Correct Inaccurate Information

26. Section 623(a)(2) of FCRA requires fumishers to promptly update and
correct information they have furnished to a CRA that they determine is not

complete or accurate. 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1681s-2(a)(2).

27. As detailed above, in numerous instances from at least January 2016

to at least August 2019, Respondent furnished to CRAs information relating to

consumers that was not complete or accurate.

28. Inmany instances, Respondent furnished information that was
inconsistent with its internal account information and inaccurate. In many other
instances, Respondent furnished a DOFD that equaled the DOAI, which was
extremely unlikely to be accurate for tradelines furnished over multiple months for

multiple accounts.

29.  Inaddition, Respondent received multiple error reports from at least

one CRA that allowed it to determinethat the information it furnished was not
complete or accurate, and Respondentâs internal audits showed at least oneof the

errors listed above.

30. Despite this knowledge, Santander did not promptly update or correct

the incomplete or inaccurate information it furnished. To the contrary, in many

10
2020-BCFP-0027 Document1 Filed 12/22/2020 Page 11 of 31

cases Santander continued reporting inconsistent information for years after being

alerted to its errors.

31. Therefore, Santander violated section 623(a)(2) of the FCRA, 15

U.S.C. Â§ 1681s-2(a)(2).
Findings and Conclusions as to Failing to Reporta DOFD

32. In at least 9,730 instances between January 2016 and August 2019,
Respondent failed to report a DOFD, leaving this field blank, when it reported
other information indicating that the accounts were more than 120 days delinquent
or had been charged off. This error could have caused incorrect delinquency
information to remain on aconsumerâs credit report for longer than it should, and,
in turn, this could potentially result in another credit report user charging a higher

cost of credit or denying credit to an affected consumer.

33. From January 2015 through June 2016 and again in December 2017
and early 2019, a CRA sent Respondent monthly error reports showing that the
company was not always reporting DOFDs when it reported other information

indicating that the accounts were delinquent.

34. Despite this information, through at least August 2019, Respondent
continued to fail to furnish DOFDs while also furnishing information indicating

that the accounts had been placed for collection, charged-off, subject to similar

11
2020-BCFP-0027 Document1 Filed 12/22/2020 Page 12 of 31

action, or were at least 120 days delinquent (which is a typical time period for

moving an account to collection and charge-off).

35. Section 623(a)(5)(A) of the FCRA requires that an entity providethe
DOFD for any account placed for collection, charged to profit or loss, or subjected
to any similar action. 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1681s-2(a)(5)(A). Thus, when Respondent failed

to report a DOFD in the 9,730 instances cited above, Respondent violated section

623(a)(5)(A) of the FCRA, 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1681s-2(a)(5)(A).
Findings and Conclusions as to Deficient Policies and Procedures

36. Respondent failed to establish and implement reasonable written
policies and procedures regarding the accuracy and integrity of the information
relating to consumers that it furnished to CRAs. In 2016, Respondentâs policies
and procedures did not require employees to add information required in the Metro
2 file after the company sold accounts to another company. When furnishers like

Respondent sell accounts, they are required to identify the purchaser.

37. Respondent submitted Metro 2 correction files for at least some
accounts that it sold. But at least 89,400 of these correction files improperly

omittedthe name ofthe account purchaser.

12

38. Until2018, Respondent did not have any written policies or
procedures requiring employees to update its internal records concerning consumer

accounts after it determmed that the internal records contamed errors.

39. When afurnisherlike Respondent determines there is an error in one
of its tradelines, it is required to correct and update the information previously

furnished.

40. For those who furnish to the national CRAs, this task is accom plished
by submitting changesto the CRAs. Simultaneously, the furnisher must correct its
internal records to ensurethat it does not send a file with the same error the next
month. Respondent had no written policies or procedures requiring its employees
to make these changes.

Al. Respondent was aware that its credit reporting policies and procedures
contained important misstatements and deficiencies. In 2016, for example, an
internal audit found that âwritten procedures do not exist that would govern daily
reporting activities within the | Credit Bureau Reporting] department.â

42. Another2016 audit foundthat Respondentâs policies and procedures

were ânot sufficientâ and pointed out specific gaps in the companyâs procedures.

MPI TRO PPT at LAPEER Ek cal PS kb Od

43. Thesame audit also noted that Respondent had no training for
electronically submitting consumer datato the CRAs or protocols to measure

whether such information was successfully transmittedto CRAs.

44. Regulation V requires furnishers to âestablish and implement
reasonable written policies and procedures regarding the accuracy and integrity of
the information relating to consumers that it furnishes to a consumer reporting
agency.â LZ2C.FLR. Â§ 1022.42(a). The policies and procedures must be appropriate
to the nature, size, complexity, and scope of the furnisherâs activities. 12 C.F.R.Â§
1022.42(a).

45. Regulation V requires that furnishersâ policies and procedures should
address establishing and implementing internal controls for accuracy and integrity
of information about consumers furnished to CRAs; training staff that furnishes
information; providing appropriate and effective oversight of service providers;
deleting, updating, and correcting information in the furnisherâs records, as
appropriate, to avoid furnishing inaccurate information; designing appropriate
technology to communicate with CRAs; and conducting a periodic evaluation of its
practices.

46. Between 2016 and 2018, Respondent failed to establish and
im plement reasonable written policies and procedures that related to the accuracy

and integnty of the consumer information it was furnishing to CRAs. Respondentâs

14
2020-BCFP-0027 Document1 Filed 12/22/2020 Page 15 of 31

written policies and procedures regarding the accuracy and integrity of the
consumer information that it furnishes to CRAs were inadequate given the high
volumeand complexity of Respondentâs furnishing activities and were not
reasonable or appropriate given the nature, size, complexity, and scope of
Respondentâs activities.

47. Therefore, Respondent violated Regulation V by failing to establish
and implementthe required reasonable written policies and procedures, 12 C.F.R.

Â§ 1022.42(a).
Findings and Conclusions as to the Consumer Financial Protection Act

48. UndertheCFPA, acovered personâs violation of a Federal consumer
financial law, which includes enumerated consumer laws and rules thereunder,
violates the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5536(a)(1)(A), 5481(14).

49. The FCRA and Regulation V are Federal consumer financial laws.

50. Respondentâs violations of the FCRA and Regulation V, described in
