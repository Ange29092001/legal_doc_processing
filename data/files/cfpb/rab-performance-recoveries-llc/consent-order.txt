Bureau Findings and Conclusions

See also 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(5) and (15)(A)(x). RAB is also a âdebt collector,â

From at least 1999 through the end of 2012, Respondent purchased
consumer-debt accounts from debt brokers and placed the accounts for
collections with collections law firms in the states where the consumers were
located.
After Respondent placed the consumer-debt accounts with collections law
firms, the collections law firms sent the consumer debtors letters demanding
payment of the full past-due amounts, as well as interest and fees.
These demand letters were sent on law-firm letterhead, referenced the fact

that the firm has been âretainedâ for the âcollection of this debt.â And,

before litigation, the law firms offered opportunities to settle the consumersâ
accounts.

If consumers did not settle their accounts with Respondent in response to
these demand letters, Respondent sued on a majority of the accounts.

The vast majority of Respondentâs collections lawsuits resulted in default
judgments against non-appearing consumers. After securing these default
judgments, Respondent used judgment-enforcement mechanisms, including
writs of attachment, execution, and garnishment, to collect on the judgments.
Respondent stopped purchasing consumer debts in 2012 and filed its last
collections lawsuit without the licensure required by applicable state law in
August 2014. Since then, Respondent has administered a portfolio of
judgments that it obtained against consumers, as well as a handful of
stipulated payment agreements that it had entered into with debtors whose
accounts it had purchased.

For some or all of the Relevant Period, Respondent was required to be
licensed under the laws of the Subject States to recover payment of
consumer debts through the judicial process. But for some or all of the
Relevant Period, Respondent both threatened litigation and sued consumers

without the licensure required by law in the Subject States.

Findings and Conclusions as to the FDCPA Violations

The FDCPA, 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1692 et seq., is a Federal consumer financial law
designed to eliminate abusive debt-collection practices, promote fair debt
collection, and provide consumers with an avenueto dispute and obtain
validation of debt information in order to ensure the informationâs accuracy.
The Bureau is empowered to enforce the FDCPA under its organic statute,
the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5563, 5564(a)-(b), 5481(12)(H), (14).

The FDCPA applies to âdebt collectors,â which the Act defines alternatively
as those engaged âin any business the principal purpose of which is the
collection of any debtsâ andthose âwho regularly collect[]â debts âowed or
due another.â 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1692a(6).

Respondent is subject to the FDCPA because the principal purpose of its
business is the collection of debts.

FDCPA Â§ 1692e(5) prohibits threats âtotake any action that cannot legally
be taken or that is not intended to be taken.â 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1692e(5).

In dozens of instances during the Relevant Period, Respondent threatened to
sue or sued consumers whose debts it owned without the legal authority to
do so under Subject-State licensure laws.

Every demand Respondent made to Subject-State consumers without the

required licensure, whether through a demand letter referencing a
19.

conditional offer to settlethe account or a lawsuit, threatened a legal action
that Respondent had no authority to take. Each demandthus violated
FDCPA Â§ 1692e(5).
FDCPA Â§ 1692e(10) prohibits â[t |he use of any false representation or
deceptive means to collect or attempt to collect any debt or to obtain
information conceming aconsumer.â 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1692e(10).
Every demand Respondent made of Subject-State consumers without the
required licensure, whether through a demand letter referencing a
conditional offer to settle the account or a lawsuit, falsely implied that
Respondent hada legally enforceable claim for payment from consumers
when it lacked any such legally enforceable claim. Each demand thus
violated FDCPA Â§ 1692e(10).

Findings and Conclusions as to CFPA Violations
CFPA Â§ 1036(a)(1)(A), 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(A), provides that it is
âunlawful for any covered person to offer or provide to a consumer any
financial product or service not in conformity with Federal consumer law, or
otherwise commit any act or omission in violation of a Federal consumer
financial law.â
Respondent is subject to this prohibition because it is a covered person

under the CFPA.
23.

24.

25.

26.

27.

28.

Respondent violated this prohibition when it violated the FDCPA
provisions set forth above.

CFPA Â§Â§ 1031 and 1036(a)(1)(B), 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531, 5536(a)(1)(B),
prohibit covered person from engaging âin any unfair, deceptive, or abusive
act or practice.â

Respondent is subject to this prohibition because it is a covered person under
the CFPA.

An act or practice is deceptive under the CFPA if it misleads or is likely to
mislead a reasonable consumer, and the misrepresentation is material.
Respondentâs threats to sue and actual lawsuits on the Subject Accounts
during the Relevant Period implicitly represented that it had a legally
enforceable right to recover payment from consumers through the judicial
process when, in fact, its failure to adhere to applicable state-licensure laws
meant it had nosuch right.

These misrepresentations were material because a reasonable consumerâs
decision whether and howto respond to a demand letter or lawsuit would
likely be affected by their knowledge that the collector had no legal right to
payment on their accountthat could be enforced through the judicial

process.
29.

30.

31.

32.

2020-BCFP-0023 Documentâ Filed 12/08/2020 Page 11 of 24

These misrepresentations were thus false, misleading, and material, and

violated the CFPAâs prohibition against deceptive acts or practices.

VI.

civil money penalty of $204,000 to the Bureau.

b. Seek or accept, directly or indirectly, reimbursement or
indemnification from any source, including but not limited to payment

nor may Respondent benefit by, any offset or reduction of any compensatory

monetary remedies imposed in any Related Consumer Action because of the

civil money penalty paid in this action. Ifthe court in any Related Consumer

Action offsets or otherwise reduces the amount of compensatory monetary

remedies imposed against Respondent based on the civil money penalty paid

in this action or based on any payment that the Bureau makes from the Civil

4].

Penalty Fund, Respondent must, within 30 days after entry ofa final order
granting such offset or reduction, notify the Bureau, and pay the amount of
the offset or reduction to the U.S. Treasury. Such a payment will not be
considered an additional civil money penalty and will not change the amount
of the civil money penalty imposed in this action.

In the event of any default on Respondentâs obligations to make payment
under this Consent Order, interest, computed under 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1961, as
amended, will accrue on any outstanding amounts not paid from the date of
