INTRODUCTION

1. This case concerns an illegal debt-collection scheme involving a
network of interrelated companies that purchases millions of dollars of
defaulted consumer debt and, using deceptive and harassing methods,
collects on that debt illegally (the Debt-Collection Operation).

2. The Debt-Collection Operation, which has operated from at
least 2015 through the present, is owned and run by Di Re and Croce and
managed by Koziel and Gracie.

3. The Debt-Collection Operation uses illegal methods to induce
consumers to make payments, including: threatening consumers with
arrest or legal action the firms had no intention of taking or could not
legally take; threatening to contact consumersâ employers, implying they
would disclose the existence of the debt; claiming consumers owed more
debt than they did in order to convince them to pay the amount they owed;

impermissibly contacting consumersâ friends, family, and workplace to

disclose the existence of a consumerâs debt or to shame or humiliate them
about the debt; harassing consumers by using intimidating, belittling, or
menacing language and repeatedly and excessively phoning consumers;
and failing to provide legally required notices informing consumers of
their right to know how much they owed and of their ability to dispute the
amount or existence of the purported debt.

4. Defendantsâ illegal debt-collection practices violate the
Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA), 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(a),
5536(a), the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), 15 U.S.C.

Â§Â§ 1692-1692p, N.Y. Executive Law Â§ 63(12), and N.Y. General Business

Law (GBL) Article 22-A, Consumer Protection from Deceptive Acts and

Practices, and Article 29-H, Debt Collection Procedures.
JURISDICTION AND VENUE

5. This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this action
because it is brought under âFederal consumer financial law,â 12 U.S.C.

Â§ 5565(a)(1), presents a federal question, 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1331, and is brought
by an agency of the United States, 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1345.

6. This Court has supplemental jurisdiction over New Yorkâs

state-law claims because they are so related to the federal claims that they

form part of the same case or controversy. 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1367(a).
7. Venue is proper in this District because Defendants are located,

reside, or do business in this District. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5564(f).
PARTIES

8. The Bureau is an independent agency of the United States
charged with regulating the offering and provision of consumer-financial
products and services under Federal consumer financial laws. 12 U.S.C.

Â§ 5481(6).

13. Regency is a Delaware limited liability company with its
principal place of business at 8828 Main Street, Williamsville, New York,
14221. As a significant part of its business, Regency, directly and through
the Debt-Collection Operation common enterprise, has collected debts
related to consumer financial products and services, including installment
and payday loans. Regency has also purchased and sold debts that are the
subject of the debt-collection activities of the other entities within the
Debt-Collection Operation. Those activities are âconsumer financial
products and servicesâ under the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(5), 15(A)(x).

New York, 14068. As a significant part of its business, Keystone, directly
and through the Debt-Collection Operation common enterprise, has
collected debts related to consumer financial products and services,
including installment and payday loans. Those activities are âconsumer
financial products and servicesâ under the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(5),
15(A)(x). Keystone is therefore a âcovered personâ under the CFPA. 12
U.S.C. Â§ 5481(6).

15. The Corporate Defendants operate as a common enterprise.
The Corporate Defendants are under common control, operate out of a
combined headquarters, and commingle funds, with one entity purchasing
and selling debt that the other entities collect. Collectors employed by the
Corporate Defendants share training materials and compete against each
other for workplace incentives. Collectors use various Corporate
Defendant names when identifying themselves to consumers in order to
cause consumers to believe that a debt has been sold to or placed with a
new collection agency when, in fact, the debt has not been sold or placed
outside the Debt-Collection Operation.

16. Because the Corporate Defendants operate as a common

enterprise, an act by one entity constitutes an act by each entity
comprising the common enterprise, and each is jointly and severally liable
for the acts and practices of all the Corporate Defendants, as alleged below.

17. From at least 2012 through the present, Christopher L. Di Re
has held ownership interests in some or all of the Corporate Defendants,
including Regency, ROC, CSA, and JPL. He holds the title of President,
CEO, or is an officer in Regency, ROC, CSA, and JPL, and has materially
participated in the conduct of their affairs. Di Re is therefore a ârelated
personâ under the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(25)(C)(i), Gi). Because Di Re is
a ârelated person,â he is deemed a âcovered personâ for purposes of the
CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(25)(B).

18. From at least 2015 through the present, Scott A. Croce has held
ownership interests in some or all of the Corporate Defendants, including
Regency, ROC, and CSA. He has materially participated in the conduct of
the affairs of the Corporate Defendants. Croce is therefore a ârelated
personâ under the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(25)(C)(i), Gi). Because Croce is
a ârelated person,â he is deemed a âcovered personâ for purposes of the
CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(25)(B).

19. From at least 2015 through the present, Brian J. Koziel has had
a management role in the Debt-Collection Operation. He has had an

ownership interest in and has been an officer of at least one of the
Case 1:20-cv-01217 Documenti1 Filed 09/08/20 Page 9 of 46

Corporate Defendants, CSA, and has been identified as a âmanagerâ of JPL
and a âmanaging memberâ of Keystone. He has been charged with
managerial responsibility for, and has materially participated in the
conduct of the affairs of, some or all of the Corporate Defendants. Koziel is
therefore a ârelated personâ under the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(25)(C)(i),
(ii). Because Koziel is a ârelated person,â he is deemed a âcovered personâ
for purposes of the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(25)(B).

20. From at least 2015 through at least June 2020, Marc D. Gracie
has had a management role in the Debt-Collection Operation. He has been
identified as a âmanagerâ of JPL and a âmanaging memberâ of Keystone.
He has been charged with managerial responsibility for, and has materially
participated in the conduct of the affairs of, some or all of the Corporate
Defendants. Gracie is therefore a ârelated personâ under the CFPA. 12
U.S.C. Â§ 5481(25)(C)(G), Gi). Because Gracie is a ârelated person,â he is

deemed a âcovered personâ for purposes of the CFPA. 12 U.S.C.

Â§ 5481(25)(B).
FACTS

21. The Debt-Collection Operation is operated by the Corporate
Defendants, a series of interrelated companies that conduct business out of
a single location in the Buffalo, New York area.

22. Through one or more of the Corporate Defendants, such as
Regency, the Debt-Collection Operation obtains defaulted consumer debt
for pennies on the dollar. A substantial portion of the defaulted debt
obtained by the Debt-Collection Operation for collection during the past
year consists of high-interest personal loans originated by the lender
LoanMe, Inc. (LoanMe), although the Debt-Collection Operation has also
obtained for collection defaulted installment loans, defaulted payday loans,
and defaulted credit card debt from various other sources. Some of this
debt is purchased outright while some of this debt is transferred or placed
for collection in another manner, such as a lease.

23. Through about 40 collectors employed by at least two of the
Corporate Defendants, such as ROC and CSA, the Debt-Collection
Operation collects or attempts to collect debt from consumers under the

names of one or more of the Corporate Defendants.

10
Case 1:20-cv-01217 Document1 Filed 09/08/20 Page 11 of 46

24. These collectors routinely engage in a wide range of deceptive
and other illegal collection tactics in connection with the collection of this
debt.

25. Using these illegal tactics, the Debt-Collection Operation
appears to have obtained revenues of approximately $10 million in 2015 to
over $23 million in 2018.

False Threats

26. Innumerous instances from at least 2015 through the present,
collectors from the Debt-Collection Operation have threatened consumers
with legal action, including wage garnishment or attachment of property,
or arrest and imprisonment, if they did not make payments.

27. These threats were false.

28. Consumers are not subject to arrest or imprisonment for
failure to pay debts.

29. The Debt-Collection Operation has never sought or obtained a
legal judgment that would be required as a pre-requisite for seeking to
garnish a consumer's wages or attach their property.

30. Docket searches have revealed no debt-collection lawsuits filed

by any of the Corporate Defendants against a consumer.

11
Case 1:20-cv-01217 Document1 Filed 09/08/20 Page 12 of 46

Falsely Claiming Consumers Owe More than they Do

31. For the collection of at least LoanMe debt, the Debt-Collection
Operation employs a ruse, which it refers to as its âLoanMe Pitch,â in
which collectors tell consumers that they owe more than they do in order
to convince them that paying the amount they actually owe represents a
substantial discount.

32. Inthe LoanMe Pitch, collectors tell consumers who have
defaulted on LoanMe debt that they are liable for the full amount that they
would have paid if they had made timely payments of principal and
interest for the entire loan period. Collectors from the Debt-Collection
Operation call this the âfull contract balance.â This representation is
bolstered by the fact that it is an amount equal to the âtotal of paymentsâ
appearing in bold letters on the face of the loan agreement.

33. However, consumers do not owe this amount on a defaulted
loan; they only owe the remaining unpaid principal of the loan plus any
unpaid contractually authorized amounts. Depending on when the
consumer defaulted in the loan contract period, the supposed âfull contract
balanceâ may be thousands of dollars more than the actual amount owed.

34. The Debt-Collection Operation instructs its collectors to tell

consumers that the original creditor could pursue them for the âfull

12
Case 1:20-cv-01217 Document1 Filed 09/08/20 Page 13 of 46

contract balance,â but they have an âopportunityâ to âsave... a ton of
moneyâ by paying the amount demanded by the collectors, which is the
amount actually owed (or sometimes less). Collectors are told to present
this as an offer that will only be available for a short period of time.

35. Infact, no consumers who defaulted on their LoanMe loans
owe the âfull contract balance,â and neither LoanMe nor the Debt-
Collection Operation have the right to pursue that amount from
consumers.

Contacting and Disclosing Debt to Third Parties

 

36. From at least 2015, the Debt-Collection Operation has
contacted friends, family, work colleagues, or supervisors of consumers in
order to pressure consumers to pay the debts under collection.

37. In this tactic, collectors for the Debt-Collection Operation
begin their collection efforts by using a skip tracing service and social
media to identify the consumerâs address, other location information
relating to the consumer, and, most importantly, third parties associated
with that consumer. This is called the âCirclesâ approach by the Debt-
Collection Operation because the collector can visualize these third parties
in a series of concentric circles around the consumer, who is at the bullâs

eye center. The surrounding circles consist of immediate family members,

eASE Lee OVeGie id fÂ£ GPOCUTAEND 2 PHO OsiVorcQ Pade 14 OF at

grandparents, distant family members, in-laws, ex-spouses, employers,
work colleagues, landlords, Facebook friends, and other known associates.

38. The collector then begins calling each of these third parties
under the pretense of attempting to find the consumer, although the
collector already has location information for the consumer. During these
calls, the collectors expressly or implicitly disclose that the consumer is in
debt or in some type of distress or difficulty. The Debt-Collection
Operation does this to âstir the pot,â so that the third parties start calling
the consumer. Thus, the consumerâs family, friends, and colleagues can
serve as the collectorâs âarmy,â pressuring the consumer to address the
collector's demands.

39. Collectors reach out to the consumer only after they have set
their âarmyâ of third parties in motion.

40. Debt-Collection Operation collectors have used this approach
even after a consumer has spoken to a collector and asked to halt further
communications, or after a consumer has initiated but then stopped
payments to the collector.

41. Consumers have described these tactics as âsmear

99 66 99 66

campaign[s|,â âextortion,â âterrorist collecting tactics,â and âemotional

terrorism.â In explaining why their collectors should follow the âCirclesâ

14
Case 1:20-cv-01217 Document1 Filed 09/08/20 Page 15 of 46

approach, the Debt-Collection Operation equates it to a form of
repossession, telling collectors: âIf I buy a car and I donât pay for it. . . they
take the car. If I donât pay for my house, they take the house... .[WHJeâre
taking [their] pride... .â

Harassing Consumers and Third Parties

42. Innumerous instances, Debt-Collection Operation collectors
have harassed consumers or third parties related to those consumers to
coerce payment.

43. Many consumers have complained that calls from the Debt-
Collection Operation to their employers or work colleagues potentially
jeopardized their jobs. Multiple consumers expressed concerns about
collectors continuing to phone consumers at work despite being told the
consumerâs workplace prohibits the consumer from receiving such
communications.

44. Many consumers have complained that collectors from the
Debt-Collection Operation also have used insulting and belittling language,
or engaged in intimidating behavior when calling consumers or third
parties. Consumers have also complained, as described above, that

collectors from the Debt-Collection Operation used threats of legal action,

15

ra

garnishment, arrest, or imprisonment, as well as threats to call consumersâ
workplaces.

45. The Circles scheme, described above, is another harassment
tactic, intended to intimidate or embarrass consumers into paying to stop
the calls.

46. Collectors from the Debt-Collection Operation also repeatedly
call consumers to induce payment. Many consumers complained that
collectors called them more than once a day over prolonged periods of
time, with several complaining of multiple calls every day over periods
lasting a month or longer.

47. These repeated calls to consumers reflect an intent to harass,
evidenced by the Debt-Collection Operationâs âzero gapâ calling strategy.
This practice requires collectors to press consumers âevery single dayâ for
payment, even after they make contact and have a live conversation with
the consumer. The Debt-Collection Operation instructs its collectors that
they should let the consumer hang up on each call so they can maintain a
pretense in their call logs that they were disconnected, and then call back

as soon as the next day.

16
Case 1:20-cv-01217 Document1 Filed 09/08/20 Page 17 of 46

48. According to consumer complaints, many collectors continued
to call consumers even after the consumer asked them to stop, hung up on
them, or told them they would not or could not pay.

Failing to Provide Debt Verification Rights Notices

49. Debt collectors are required to send a notice within five days
after the initial communication with the consumer. This legally mandated
notice must tell consumers (1) the amount of the alleged debt; (2) the
name of the creditor to whom the purported debt is owed; (3) a statement
that unless the consumer disputes the debt, the debt will be assumed valid;
(4) a statement that if the consumer disputes all or part of the debt in
writing within 30 days, the debt collector will obtain verification of the
debt and mail it to the consumer; and (5) a statement that, upon the
consumer's written request within the 30-day period, the debt collector
will provide the name and address of the original creditor, if different from
the current creditor. Collectors are not required to send the notice if this
information is contained in the initial communication with the consumer.

50. The Debt-Collection Operation did not provide the statutorily-
required notices. Many consumers reported that the collector claimed to

have sent such notices, even though they never received them. Some

17
Case 1:20-cv-01217 Document1 Filed 09/08/20 Page 18 of 46

consumers said collectors refused to provide such notices, wrongly stating
they were not obligated to send them.

51. Because consumers did not receive the validation notice, they
were not informed that they must dispute the debt in writing in order to
require the collector to provide verification of the debt. When consumers
made the verification request orally, Corporate Defendants did not provide
verification or cease collection. According to consumer complaints, some
consumers who asked for a physical address to send such a request were
denied that information.

Role and Knowledge of the Individual Defendants

52. Di Re and Croce together appear to own nearly 100% of at least
three of the Corporate Defendants. They are bank signatories or officers of
certain Corporate Defendants. They also co-own the LLC that purchased
the building out of which the Debt-Collection Operation is run.

53. Di Re and Croce are owners who are in the office regularly and
approve, adopt, or ratify the Corporate Defendantsâ unlawful collection
practices, including by meeting regularly with the Corporate Defendantsâ
managers to rate randomly-selected collectorsâ calls to ensure adherence to
company policies. Di Re and Croce also regularly monitor collectorsâ

calling patterns to ensure there are no âgapsâ in their calling of consumers.

18
They award workplace incentives to the employees who earn the most
money for the Corporate Defendants. Di Re encourages collectors to
contact him directly for advice on how to improve their collection skills
and earn more money for themselves and the Corporate Defendants.

54. Koziel and Gracie have been held out as âmembersâ of
Keystone. Koziel has also been held out as a manager of JPL, and as
President, one-third owner (until sometime in 2018 when he transferred
his interest to Di Re and Croce), Compliance Officer, and bank signatory
for CSA. Koziel is identified in collectorsâ employee handbooks as their
supervisor. Gracie has been held out as an officer or manager of ROC and
JPL.

55. Koziel revises and approves talk-off scripts, meets with Di Re
and Croce regularly, and is responsible for recruiting new employees.
Koziel and Gracie have both worked to hire new collectors for the Debt-
Collection Operation through social media as recently as April 2020.

56. Di Re, Croce, Gracie, and Koziel knew about, were reckless to
the fact of, or ignored red flags reflecting, the practices described above.
This was the case through their management, authority, and control over

the Debt-Collection Operation.

19
57. Collectors were told that Di Re and Croce reviewed recordings
of their collection calls twice weekly with managers of the Debt-Collection
Operation.

58. Collectors were told that Di Re and Croce reviewed their
training session, at which some of the tactics described above were
explained.

59. The training manual used for the Debt-Collection Operation
describes how collectors should use skip-tracing software, Facebook, and
Google to locate a consumerâs parents, in-laws, grandparents, grand-
parent in-laws, siblings, cousins, employers, friends lists, other possible
relatives, and other likely associates that are at the heart of the Circles
approach. The training manual also includes scripts detailing how to
present the LoanMe Pitch to consumers, and scripts instructing collectors
to say their company will âexplore every means necessaryâ if consumers
refuse to pay. The âCSA+ROCâ Employee Handbook included in the
training materials identifies Brian Koziel as a âsupervisor.â

60. Since 2015, numerous consumer complaints have been lodged
against the Debt-Collection Operation through the Bureau, NYAG, other
law enforcement agencies, and consumer organizations, each of which

identified at least one of the debt-collection practices described above.

Many of these complaints were forwarded to the Debt-Collection
Operation for its response.

61. In 2018, the BBB publicly issued a âscam trackerâ warning
against API (one of ROCâs dbas) stating âBBB just wants to advise you to
not pay any debt to API Recovery Solutions.â The BBB also publicly
assigned F ratings to JPL, Warner (one of CSAâs dbas), and API. Koziel
and Gracie are listed as points of contact for complaints from the BBB and
the Bureau.

62. Since 2015, more than 20 private lawsuits have been filed by
consumers against varying Corporate Defendants relating to the Debt-
Collection Operation, with several naming Di Re, Koziel, and Gracie
personally, alleging some of the debt-collection practices described above.

63. The Corporate Defendants were subject to high chargeback
rates in connection with their work for the Debt-Collection Operation.
High chargeback rates are a red flag for wrongdoing, and as owners and
managers, the Individual Defendants would have notice of the chargeback
rates. Koziel and Gracie are listed as points of contact for complaints and

chargebacks from the Corporate Defendantsâ payment processor.

VIOLATIONS OF THE FDCPA AS TO ALL DEFENDANTS

64. Each of the Corporate Defendants is or has been a person who
has used an instrumentality of interstate commerce or the mails ina
business the principal purpose of which is the collection of debts, or who
regularly collects or attempts to collect, directly or indirectly, debts owed
or due or asserted to be owed or due another, and is a âdebt collectorâ
under the FDCPA. 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1692a(6).

65. Each of the Individual Defendants, due to his position of
control and involvement in the Debt-Collection Operation, and his
authorization, adoption, or ratification of the acts of the Corporate

COUNT V
Deception Under the CFPA Relating to Collection of, and Attempts to

Collect, Debts
(All Defendants)

87. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference paragraphs 5,

88. Section 1036(a)(1)(B) of the CFPA prohibits deceptive acts or
practices. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(B). An act or practice is deceptive if it
involves a material misrepresentation that is likely to mislead a consumer
acting reasonably under the circumstances.

89. Innumerous instances, in connection with the collection of
purported consumer debts, Corporate Defendants have represented,
directly or indirectly, expressly or by implication, that:

a. Corporate Defendants will have the consumer arrested or
imprisoned for nonpayment;
b. Corporate Defendants would file lawsuits against consumers

if they failed to pay, and that the filing of such lawsuits was

imminent;

29
c. Corporate Defendants would seek to garnish or attach
consumersâ wages or property if they failed to pay; and

d. Consumers owed an amount of money that the Corporate
Defendants described as the âfull contract balance,â and that
the original creditor could seek to collect this amount if it
chose to.

90. Intruth and in fact, where Corporate Defendants have made
the representations set forth in Paragraph 89 of this Complaint:

a. Corporate Defendants have not, and could not have, had
consumers arrested or imprisoned;

b. Corporate Defendants have not filed, and do not intend to
file, lawsuits against consumers for nonpayment;

c. Corporate Defendants would not seek and could not seek to
garnish or attach consumersâ wages or property if they failed
to pay; and

d. Consumers did not owe the amounts Corporate Defendants
described as the âfull contract balance,â and neither
Corporate Defendants nor the original creditor could legally
collect such amounts, which were sometimes thousands of

dollars more than the consumer legally owed.

91. These false and misleading misrepresentations were material
and likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under the

and 1036(a)(1)(B) of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).

acts and practices because they had authority to control these
representations or participated in them. They have known about, have
been reckless to the fact of, or have ignored red flags with respect to, these
false and misleading representations. The Individual Defendants are
therefore liable for these violations of the CFPA.

payments to Corporate Defendants.

102. The Individual Defendants provided substantial assistance to
the Corporate Defendants that engaged in the practices described in Count
