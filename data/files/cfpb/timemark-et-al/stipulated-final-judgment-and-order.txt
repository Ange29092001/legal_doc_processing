Order to Pay Redress
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that:

20. A judgment for monetary relief is entered in favor of the Bureau and against
Defendants, jointly and severally, in the amount of $3,784,360 for the purpose of providing
redress to Affected Consumers; however, full payment of this judgment will be suspended upon
satisfaction of the obligations in Paragraph 21 of this Section and Paragraphs 34-38 and 40 of
Section VI and subject to Section IV of this Order.

21. Within 10 days of the Effective Date, Defendants must pay to the Bureau, by wire
transfer to the Bureau or to the Bureauâs agent, and according to the Bureauâs wiring instructions,
the following amounts, in partial satisfaction of the judgment as ordered in Paragraph 20 of this
Section:

a. Corporate Defendant must pay $5,000;
b. Individual Defendant Mark Nagler must pay $7,000;

including but not limited to payment made under any insurance policy, or if Defendants secure
a tax deduction or tax credit with regard to any federal, state, or local tax, Defendants must: (a)
immediately notify the Enforcement Director in writing, and (b) within 10 days of receiving the

statutes and regulations to be used for redress for injured consumers, including, but not limited
to, refund of moneys, restitution, damages or other monetary relief, and for any attendant

expenses for the administration of any such redress.

24. If the Bureau determines, in its sole discretion, that providing redress to
consumers is wholly or partially impracticable or if funds remain after the administration of
redress is completed, the Bureau will deposit any remaining funds in the U.S. Treasury as
disgorgement. Defendants will have no right to challenge the Bureauâs choice of remedies
under this Section, and will have no right to contest the manner of distribution chosen by the
Bureau.

25. Payment of redress to any Affected Consumer under this Order may not be
conditioned on that Affected Consumer waiving any right.

IV

Effect of Misrepresentation or Omission Regarding Financial Condition

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that:

26. The suspension of the monetary judgment entered in Section III of this Order is

May 12, 2020 and submitted to the Bureau on and about May 20, 2020; and

g. The Declaration of Individual Defendant Casey Gassaway signed on June
24, 2020 and submitted to the Bureau on and about June 26, 2020.

27. If upon motion by the Bureau, the Court determines that any Defendant has failed to
disclose any material asset or that any of his financial statements or oral testimony contain any
material misrepresentation or omission, including materially misstating the value of any asset,
the Court shall terminate the suspension of the monetary judgment entered in Section III and
without further adjudication, shall reinstate the judgment entered in Section III of this Order and
the full judgment set forth in that Section with respect to that Defendant shall be immediately
due and payable, less any amounts paid to the Bureau under Section III of this Order.

28. If the Court terminates the suspension of the monetary judgment under this Section,
the Bureau will be entitled to interest on the judgment, computed from the date of entry of this
Order, at the rate prescribed by 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1961, as amended, on any outstanding amounts not
paid.

29. Provided, however, that in all other respects this Order shall remain in full force and
effect unless otherwise ordered by the Court; and, provided further, that proceedings instituted
under this provision would be in addition to, and not in lieu of any other civil or criminal
remedies as may be provided by law, including any other proceedings that the Bureau may
initiate to enforce this Order.

V
Order to Pay Civil Money Penalty

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that:

30. Under Section 1055(c) of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5565(c), by reason of the
violations of law alleged in the Complaint and taking into account the factors in 12 U.S.C. Â§
5565(c)(3), a judgment for a civil money penalty is entered in favor of the Bureau and against
each Defendant, in the amount of $1. This amount is based on each Defendantâs limited ability

to pay as attested to in his financial statements listed in Section IV above.

31. Within 10 days of the Effective Date, each Defendant must pay the civil money
penalty by wire transfer to the Bureau or to the Bureauâs agent in compliance with the

Bureauâs wiring instructions.

32. The civil money penalty paid under this Order will be deposited in the Civil Penalty
Fund of the Bureau as required by Section 1017(d) of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5497(d).

33. Defendants must treat the civil money penalty paid under this Order as a penalty paid
to the government for all purposes. Regardless of how the Bureau ultimately uses those funds,
Defendants may not:

a. claim, assert, or apply for a tax deduction, tax credit, or any other tax

benefit for any civil money penalty paid under this Order; or

b. seek or accept, directly or indirectly, reimbursement or indemnification from
any source, including but not limited to payment made under any insurance
policy, with regard to any civil money penalty paid under this Order.

Individual Defendants agree that the civil penalty imposed by the Order represents a civil
penalty owed to the United States Government, is not compensation for actual pecuniary loss,
and, thus, as to Individual Defendants, it is not subject to discharge under the Bankruptcy Code
under 11 U.S.C. Â§ 523(a)(7).

VI

Additional Monetary Provisions

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that:

34. In the event of any default on Defendantsâ obligations to make payment under this
Order, interest, computed under 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1961, as amended, will accrue on any outstanding
amounts not paid from the date of default to the date of payment, and will immediately become
due and payable.

35. Defendants relinquish all dominion, control, and title to the funds paid under this
Order to the fullest extent permitted by law and no part of the funds may be returned to
Defendants.

36. The facts alleged in the Complaint will be taken as true and be given collateral
estoppel effect, without further proof, in any proceeding based on the entry of the Order, or in

any subsequent civil litigation by or on behalf of the Bureau, including in a proceeding to

enforce its rights to any payment or monetary judgment under this Order, such as a
nondischargeability complaint in any bankruptcy case.

37. The facts alleged in the Complaint establish all elements necessary to sustain an
action by the Bureau under Section 523(a)(2)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. Â§
523(a)(2)(A), and for such purposes this Order will have collateral estoppel effect against each
Defendant, even in such Defendantâs capacity as debtor-in-possession.

38. Under 31 U.S.C. Â§ 7701, Defendants, unless they already have done so, must furnish
to the Bureau their taxpayer-identification numbers, which may be used for purposes of
collecting and reporting on any delinquent amount arising out of this Order.

39. Within 30 days of the entry of a final judgment, Order, or settlement in a Related
Consumer Action, Defendants must notify the Enforcement Director of the final judgment,
Order, or settlement in writing. That notification must indicate the amount of redress, if any, that
Defendants paid or are required to pay to consumers and describe the consumers or classes of
consumers to whom that redress has been or will be paid. To preserve the deterrent effect of the
civil money penalty in any Related Consumer Action, Defendants may not argue that
Defendants are entitled to, nor may Defendants benefit by, any offset or reduction of any
monetary remedies imposed in the Related Consumer Action because of the civil money penalty
paid in this action or because of any payment that the Bureau makes from the Civil Penalty
Fund. If the court in any Related Consumer Action offsets or otherwise reduces the amount of
compensatory monetary remedies imposed against Defendants based on the civil money penalty
paid in this action or based on any payment that the Bureau makes from the Civil Penalty Fund,
Defendants must, within 30 days after entry of a final order granting such offset or reduction,
notify the Bureau and pay the amount of the offset or reduction to the U.S. Treasury. Such a
payment will not be considered an additional civil money penalty and will not change the

amount of the civil money penalty imposed in this action.

40. Upon written request, any consumer reporting agency must furnish consumer reports
to the Bureau concerning any Individual Defendant under Section 604(a)(1) of the Fair Credit
Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1681 b(a)(1), which may be used for purposes of collecting and

reporting on any delinquent amount arising out of this Order.
