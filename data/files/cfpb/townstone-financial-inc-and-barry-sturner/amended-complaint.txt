17. As of 2010, the Chicago MSA included about 1.6 million African-
American residents.

18. As of 2010, the Chicago MSAâs population was 9,461,105, of which 17%
were African Americans. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 30.1% of the
residents of the City of Chicago were African Americans.

19. As of 2010, 18.7% of the Chicago MSAâs 2,215 census tracts were
majority-African-American, and 13.8% were high-African-American.

20. From 2014 through 2017, Townstone drew about 2,700 mortgage-loan
applications from and originated about 1,800 mortgage loans in the Chicago MSA.

21. From 2014 through 2017, Townstone drew over 90% of its mortgage-
loan applications for properties within the Chicago MSA.

Townstoneâs Marketing

22. Since at least 2014, Townstone has engaged 1n acts or practices directed
at prospective applicants that, together and separately, would discourage prospective
applicants, on the basis of race, from seeking or obtaining credit for properties within
the Chicago MSA.

23. Townstoneâs business model has been to market and draw mortgage-
loan applications primarily through radio advertising.

24. Starting at least as early as 2014, âTownstone has marketed through âThe

Townstone Financial Show,â its own radio show and podcast.
jena
;

25. Townstone has generated up to 90% of its mortgage-loan applications
from radio advertising, including through the Townstone Financial Show.

26. The Townstone Financial Show is a long-form commercial
advertisement, which Townstone refers to as an infomercial, that also includes shorter
advertisements for Townstone during commercial breaks. Since 2014, the Townstone
Financial Show hosts have discussed mortgage-related issues on the show and have
taken questions from prospective applicants. âThe hosts have regularly referred to their
work at Townstone and promoted the benefits that prospective applicants might
expect from applying for mortgage loans from âTownstone.

27. Since about January 2015, the Townstone Financial Show has been co-
hosted by Sturner and another senior loan officer.

28. Townstoneâs website and the Townstone Financial Show have described
the hosts of the Townstone Financial Show as âChicago real-estate experts.â

29. Starting at least as early as 2014, the Townstone Financial Show was
conducted weekly on AM radio and reached the entire Chicago MSA. A weekly
podcast of the radio show has been available exclusively online. Townstone Financial
Show radio broadcasts and podcasts have been available on the Townstone website.
Both the radio show and podcast have been streamed on Facebook Live and then
advertised on Facebook, âTwitter, and LinkedIn.

30. The hosts have typically started the Townstone Financial Show podcasts

by stating Townstoneâs licensing information, including that Townstone is a licensed

6
jena
;

mottgage broker/banker, NMLS number 136639, Illinois residential-mortgage
licensee number 6629.

31. The Townstone Financial Show radio broadcasts have typically included
an introductory statement such as: âThis show is brought to you by Townstone
Financial, the home-loan expert since 2002. Townstone Financial is an Indiana,
Michigan, Wisconsin, Florida, Illinois mortgage licensee 6629, NMLS 136639.
Remember no one values your mortgage business more than Townstone Financial.â

32. The Townstone Financial Show has regularly included statements that
would discourage African-American prospective applicants from applying for
mortgage loans, or making or pursuing an application, including from Townstone;
would discourage prospective applicants living in majority- or high-African-American
neighborhoods from applying for mortgage loans, or making or pursuing an
application, including from Townstone; and would discourage prospective applicants
from applying for mortgage loans, or making or pursuing an application, for
properties in majority- or high-African-American neighborhoods, including from
Townstone.

33. For example, during a January 2014 broadcast in which Townstone
marketed its services, a caller from Markham, Illinois, asked how he and his wife
could improve their credit scores. Markham 1s a city in Cook County, Illinois, and its
population ts 80.3% African American, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

Referring to the women of this predominately African-American area, the Townstone

7
Financial Showâs host responded that â[youâve] got to keep those women in line over
there in Markham.â The host went so far as to presume that the caller should âstop
spending freaking money [on his wife] and tell her to get a better job.â While
discussing the coupleâs credit concerns, the host turned his comments toward
Markham generally, claiming that âitâs crazy in Markham on weekendsâ and stating, âT
know, Iâve been to Markham.â âYou drive very fast through Markham,â he
continued, âand you donât look at anybody or lock on anybodyâs eyes in

Markham .... You look at your dashboard, you donât lock on anybody.â

34. In another January 2014 broadcast of the Townstone Financial Show,
during which âTownstone marketed its services, Townstoneâs then-president
encouraged listeners that ââitâs a great time to buy, itâs a great time to rent, itâs a great
time to sell.â The showâs hosts, including a local realtor and a bankruptcy attorney,
then recommended that listeners preparing a home for sale should âtake down the
Confederate flag.â

35. Ina June 2016 episode of the Townstone Financial Show, during which
Townstone marketed its services, before discussing the mortgage-lending services that
Townstone could provide to police officers and others, Sturner volunteered his view
of the South Side of Chicago. The South Side refers to the southern neighborhoods in
the City of Chicago and 1s majority-African-American, with about 489,000 African
American or Black residents. According to Sturner, that part of the city between

Friday and Monday 1s âhoodlum weekend,â and the police are âthe only ones between

8
that [area] turning into a real war zone and keeping it where itâs kind of at.â

36. Ina January 2017 episode of the Townstone Financial Show, during
which âTownstone marketed its services, the hosts discussed a now-replaced grocery
store in downtown Chicago that was part of the Jewel-Osco grocery-store chain.
Sturner described â[having] to go to the Jewel on Division,â which he referred to as
âJungle Jewel.â Sturner described the âJungle Jewelâ as âa scary place,â attributing his
fear and the storeâs nickname to the âJungle Jewelâsâ patrons who âpackedâ the store
and âwere people from all over the world.â

37. Ina November 2017 episode of the Townstone Financial Show, during
which Townstone marketed its services, Townstoneâs senior loan officer discussed a
recent skydiving experience and the ensuing ârushâ from the jump; another
Townstone host responded that he thought skydiving was crazy and suggested that
someone âwalking through the South Side at 3AM [would] get the same rush.â

38. Through the Townstone Financial Show, Townstone has characterized
areas and people in a manner that would discourage those who identify or associate
with those areas or people from applying for credit. For example, the Townstone
Financial Showâs hosts have disparaged majority-African-American areas as âhoodlum
weekendâ and approaching âa real war zoneâ or as âcrazyâ and places âto be driven
through quicklyâ while avoiding eye contact; they have referred to a place with

âpeople from all over the worldâ as a âjungleâ and âscaryâ; they have disparaged the

women of a predominantly African-American area; and their home-selling advice has
included recommendations regarding displays of the Confederate flag.

39. A prospective applicant is reasonable to consider statements made by
loan officers, realtors, and others marketing themselves as real-estate experts when
making decisions about a property or seeking credit. And a reasonable prospective
applicant would consider the characteristics of prospective neighborhoods, including
the neighborhoodsâ safety or dangerousness, when making decisions about a property
or seeking credit.

40. Even though African Americans made up 30% of the population of the
City of Chicago, Townstone has not targeted any marketing toward African
Americans in the Chicago MSA.

41. Townstone has engaged in unlawful conduct by engaging tn acts or
practices that would discourage African-American prospective applicants from
applying for mortgage loans, or making or pursuing an application, including from
Townstone; would discourage prospective applicants living in majority- or high-
African-American neighborhoods from applying for mortgage loans, or making or
pursuing an application, including from Townstone; and would discourage
prospective applicants from applying for mortgage loans, or making or pursuing an
application, for properties in majority- or high-African-American neighborhoods,

including from Townstone.

10
Applications from African-American Neighborhoods

42. Based on HMDA data from 2014 through 2017, Townstone received an
average of 740 mortgage-loan applications each year. Townstone brokered an average
of 60 total Federal Housing Administration and Veterans Administration home loans
each yeat.

43. Townstone has drawn few applications from African-American
applicants throughout the Chicago MSA. From 2014 through 2017, Townstone drew
about 2,700 applications, of which only 37 (1.4%) came from African Americans in
the Chicago MSA. During the same period, other mortgage lenders 1n the Chicago
MSA drew 1,217,223 applications, of which 119,370 (9.8%) came from African-
American applicants.

44. Similarly, from 2014 through 2017, Townstone drew almost no
applications from applicants applying for mortgage loans for properties in majority-
African-American neighborhoods. During the same period, âTownstone drew an
average of five or six applications each year (0.8%, 0.8%, 0.7%, and 0.9% of all
Townstone applications) for properties in high-African-American neighborhoods,
even though such neighborhoods made up 13.8% of the Chicago MSAâs census tracts.
Of Townstoneâs five or six applications each year for properties in high-African-
American neighborhoods (more than 80% African American), more than half each

year were from non-Hispanic white applicants.

45. Similarly, only 2.3%, 1.4%, 1.4%, and 2.2% of Townstoneâs applications
for the years 2014 through 2017, respectively, came from applicants applying for
mortgage loans for properties in majority-African-American areas, even though 18.7%
of the Chicago MSAâs census tracts were majority-African-American.

46. Statistical analyses of Townstoneâs mortgage-loan applications in the
Chicago MSA, as compared to its peer lenders during the same period, show
disparities between Townstone and its peers in drawing mortgage-loan applications
for properties in African-American neighborhoods.

47. These disparities are statistically significant and demonstrate that there
were applicants seeking mortgage loans for properties in African-American
neighborhoods in the Chicago MSA from âTownstoneâs peers in much higher
proportions than from Townstone.

48. Townstone had no legitimate, non-discriminatory reason to draw
relatively few applications for mortgage loans for properties in these majority-African-
American areas.

49. Townstone drew a significantly smaller proportion of mortgage-loan
applications for properties in majority-African-American neighborhoods than did its
peer lenders operating in the Chicago MSA. While Townstone drew 2.3%, 1.4%,
1.4%, and 1.3% of its applications for properties in majority-African-American
neighborhoods from 2014 through 2017, respectively, Townstoneâs peers drew many

times moreâ8.2%, 7.6%, 7.7%, and 8.1%.

50. Similarly, Townstone drew a significantly smaller proportion of
mortgage-loan applications for properties in high-African-American neighborhoods
than its peers operating in the Chicago MSA. While âTownstone drew only 0.8%,
0.8%, 0.7%, and 0.9% of its applications for mortgage loans for properties in high-
African-American census tracts from 2014 through 2017, respectively, other similar
lenders drew 5.3%, 4.9%, 5.1%, and 5.5% of their applications from such census
tractsâ6.3, 6.2, 7.7 and 6.1 times that of Townstone.

51. Townstone employed 17 loan officers from 2014 through 2017.
Townstone did not employ an African-American loan officer during that period, even
though it was aware that hiring a loan officer from a particular racial or ethnic group
could increase the number of applications from members of that racial or ethnic
eroup.

52. âTownstoneâs hiring practices, consumer outreach, consumer
interactions, and other business acts or practices exclude or treat differently African-
American prospective applicants for credit, as well as prospective applicants for credit
in African-American census tracts.

Â§ 5536(a)(1)(A).

61. âTownstoneâs ECOA violations, described above in Count 1, constitute

COUNT 3: FRAUDULENT TRANSFERâSTURNER

62. The Bureau incorporates the allegations of Paragraphs 1-52 here by
reference.
