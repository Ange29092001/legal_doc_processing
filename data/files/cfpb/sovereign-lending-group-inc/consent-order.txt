In the Matter of:

CONSENT ORDER

Sovereign Lending Group, Inc.

 

 

The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau) has reviewed certain
direct-mail mortgage advertising activities of Sovereign Lending Group, Inc.
(Sovereign or Respondent, as defined below) and identified violations of Â§ 1026.24
of Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24, the implementing regulation of the Truth in
Lending Act (TILA), 15 U.S.C. Â§$Â§ 1601â1667f; Â§ 1014.3 of the Mortgage Acts
and PracticesâAdvertising Rule (MAP Rule or Regulation N), 12 C.F.R. Â§
1014.3; and Â§Â§ 1031 and 1036 of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010
(CFPA), 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531, 5536. Under Â§Â§ 1053 and 1055 of the CFPA, 12

U.S.C. 88 5563, 5565, the Bureau issues this Consent Order.
Overview
Sovereign is a mortgage broker and lender that offers and provides
mortgages guaranteed by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs
(VA). Occasionally, it has acted as the creditor, providing loans itself; in
other situations, it has acted as a broker, arranging for another creditor to
provide loans.
Sovereign advertises these mortgage products to consumers through direct-
mail advertising campaigns targeted primarily at United States military
servicemembers and veterans.
Sovereign has sent consumers hundreds of thousands of advertisements that
violate federal law because of misleading and deceptive statements and
inadequate disclosures.
The Bureau brings this action to stop Sovereign from distributing
advertisements with misleading and deceptive statements and inadequate
disclosures to servicemembers, veterans, and other consumers.

Sovereign offers consumer mortgages, including mortgages guaranteed by
the VA.

Sovereignâs principal means of advertising VA-guaranteed mortgages is
through direct-mail advertisements sent to consumers, including veterans
and servicemembers.

Since January 2016, Sovereign has mailed millions of mortgage
advertisements to consumers in about 44 states and the District of Columbia.
Hundreds of thousands of consumers have received at least one of
Sovereignâs direct-mail advertisements, and thousands of consumers have

obtained mortgages through Sovereign.
False, Misleading, and Inaccurate Representations

Federal consumer financial law contains numerous provisions banning the
use of misleading and deceptive statements in mortgage advertisements.
Despite those prohibitions, Sovereign was responsible for both the content
of, and the dissemination of, numerous mortgage advertisements during the
Relevant Period that contained false, misleading, and inaccurate statements,

as described below.

False, Misleading, and Inaccurate
Representations About Cost and Other Credit Terms

Most of Sovereignâs mortgage advertisements stated specific credit terms,
such as an interest rate, annual percentage rate (APR), and payment amount.
By stating specific credit terms in its advertisements, Sovereign represented,
expressly or by implication, that it arranged or offered a mortgage with those
credit terms.

In fact, Sovereign did not arrange or offer mortgages with the specific credit
terms stated in many of those advertisements.

In numerous instances, Sovereign misrepresented the actual credit terms
applicable to the mortgages that it would arrange or offer.

Numerous Sovereign mortgage advertisements described mortgages with a
simple interest rate and APR combination that, on the date of the
advertisement, Sovereign was not actually prepared to arrange or offer.

For example, Sovereign advertisements sent to 87,000 consumers in
September 2018 advertised a variable-rate mortgage with a fixed interest
rate of 2.75% for the first five years and an APR of 3.5%.

In fact, the advertised APR was not correct because it did not take into

account the fully indexed rate, required discount points, or origination fees.
30.

31.

32.

33.

34.

35.

The actual APR for this loan, calculated in accordance with Regulation Z
and taking into account the fully indexed rate, required discount points, and
origination, underwriting, and funding fees, exceeded 3.75%.

Accordingly, Sovereign misrepresented the actual APR for loans offered in
these advertisements.

Numerous Sovereign mortgage advertisements misrepresented the payment
amount applicable to the advertised mortgage and the existence, nature, or
amount of cash or credit available to the consumer in connection with the
mortgage.

For example, Sovereign advertisements sent to 87,000 consumers in
September 2018 stated in a box near the top, âTake $27,909 CASH-OUT
FOR ONLY $113.94 PER MONTH!â (upper case in original).

In reality, obtaining any cash-out amount against the consumerâs home
equity would be possible only if the consumer had an existing mortgage and
refinanced the entire amount owed on that mortgage as part of a cash-out
refinance mortgage, resulting in a total monthly payment larger than
$113.94.

Numerous Sovereign mortgage advertisements misleadingly advertised

variable-rate loans as âfixedâ rate loans.

For example, Sovereign advertisements sent to at least 19,600 consumers in
February 2019 used the phrase âNew FIXED Rateâ (upper case in original)
next to the advertised interest rate on the front, but in fine print on the back,
stated that the advertised loan was, in fact, a variable-rate mortgage.

In these advertisements, the phrase âAdjustable-Rate Mortgage,â âVariable-
Rate Mortgage,â or âARMâ did not appear before the first use of the word
âfixed,â nor was the phrase at least as conspicuous as any use of the word
âfixedâ in the advertisements.

In these advertisements, the word âfixedâ was not accompanied by an
equally prominent and closely proximate statement of the period for which
the rate or payment would be fixed, and of the fact that the rate may vary or
the payment may increase after that period.

Consumers who received the advertisements described in Paragraphs 27-38
were likely to be misled by them.

The advertisements were also likely to affect consumersâ conduct or

decisions with regard to obtaining a loan.

False and Misleading Representations About the Consumerâs Ability or

Likelihood to Obtain the Advertised Credit Term

Numerous Sovereign mortgage advertisements falsely represented that
consumers were prequalified for, or had a high likelihood of obtaining, the
advertised loan.

For example, Sovereign advertisements sent to at least 25,500 consumers in
October 2018 stated: âAs a VA loan holder, youâre prequalified to upgrade
your home loan and pay off your mortgage sooner by refinancing with
Sovereign ....â These advertisements also stated: âPRESCREEN & OPT-
OUT NOTICE: This âprescreenedâ offer of credit is based on information in
your credit report indicating that you meet certain criteriaâ (emphasis in
original).

In fact, consumers who received these advertisements had not been selected
or screened based on credit scores or other prescreened credit data.

In another example, Sovereign advertisements sent to at least 4,300
consumers in October 2018 stated near the top of the front page âLow FICO
Score OK,â among or in close proximity to other specific credit terms of the
advertised loan, such as the APR, interest rate, and payment amount.

But in fine print on the back, these advertisements stated: âOffer rate...

assumes ... all borrowers having a credit score of at least 740.â The

statement âLow FICO Score OKâ was false and did not apply to the loans
offered in these advertisements.

Sovereign targeted these advertisements to consumers with FICO scores in
the range of 560-750. Thus, most consumers who received these
advertisements likely did not have a credit score of at least 740 and therefore
would not have been candidates for the advertised loan.

Consumers who received the advertisements described in Paragraphs 41-46
were likely to be misled by them.

The advertisements were also likely to affect consumersâ conduct or
decisions with regard to obtaining a loan.

False and Misleading Representations About
an Affiliation with the Government

Numerous Sovereign mortgage advertisements falsely represented, directly
or by implication, that Sovereign was affiliated with the government.

For example, Sovereign advertisements sent to at least 87,000 consumers in
September 2018 contained these phrases or terms: âEligibility Notice;â
âReference #: V146310333â; and â[a]s a VA loan holder, the Department of
Veteran Affairs allows you to combine... .â These advertisements were
published on light green paper that is similar to the light green paper that the

VA has used for Certificates of Eligibility, and the VA Certificates of
SI.

Eligibility contain a certificate âReference Numberâ that generally has eight

In another example, Sovereign advertisements sent to at least 236,900
consumers in February 2019 stated âEligibility Status: Pending
Authorization;â âMortgage Payment Reduction Notification;â âReduction
Notice;â âReference # V107652374;â and â[als a VA loan holder, the
Department of Veteran Affairs allows you to combine... .â These
advertisements included the year â2019â printed in block numbers in the top
right corner, with the â20â in white and the â19â in black, a distinctive
format used by the IRS. These advertisements also set forth information in
boxes similar to an IRS Form W-4.

Those representations were false because Sovereign was not affiliated with
the government.

Consumers who received the advertisements described in Paragraphs 49-52
were likely to be misled by them.

The advertisements were also likely to affect consumersâ conduct or

decisions with regard to obtaining a loan.

False Representations About Late Payments,
Rate Adjustments, and Payment Increases

Numerous Sovereign mortgage advertisements contained false statements
that the consumer was late on her loan payments and that there were
unauthorized rate adjustments or unnecessary payment increases on her loan.
Specifically, Sovereign advertisements sent to at least 236,900 consumers in
February 2019 stated in a banner across the center: âNOTICE REGARDING
LATE PAYMENT, UNAUTHORIZED INTEREST RATE
ADJUSTMENTS OR UNNECESSARY PAYMENT INCREASES YOUR
IMMEDIATE PARTICIPATION IS REQUESTEDâ (upper case in
original).

These representations were false. The advertisements were not notices
regarding late payments, unauthorized interest rate adjustments, or
unnecessary payment increases.

The advertisements were likely to lead consumers into believing that they
needed to read the advertisement because the consumer was purportedly late
with mortgage payments or because her current lender had purportedly
wrongly charged additional sums through improper interest rate or payment
increases. The advertisements were also likely to lead consumers into

believing that refinancing with Sovereign would avoid or prevent the

purported late payment, rate adjustments, or payment increases on the
consumerâs existing loan, or associated negative impacts.

The advertisements purported to convey important information about the
consumerâs existing loan in a manner that would induce the consumer to
read the advertisement, and that would frighten or pressure the consumer
into potentially obtaining a new loan from Sovereign.

Consumers who received the advertisements described in Paragraphs 55-59
were likely to be misled by them.

The advertisements were also likely to affect consumersâ conduct or
decisions regarding a product or service.

Inadequate Disclosures

Most of Sovereignâs mortgage advertisements stated a number of payments,
payment amount, or simple annual rate of interest. Under certain sections of
Regulation Z, including Â§ 1026.24(c), (d), and (f), the use of these terms
triggers specific disclosure requirements. Many of the advertisements did
not include the other disclosures that are required, or did not include them in
the manner required.

Numerous Sovereign mortgage advertisements stated the number of

payments or the amount of a payment, but failed to state the terms of
64.

repayment reflecting the consumerâs repayment obligations over the full
term of the loan.

For example, Sovereign advertisements sent to at least 19,600 consumers in
February 2019 stated that the advertised loan would require a total of 360
payments and a fixed monthly payment of $923 that would apply to the first
five years.

Although these advertisements stated the number of payments and the
payment amount for the fixed-rate period of the loan, they failed to state the
amount of each payment and the number and period of the payments during
the variable-rate period of the loan (years 6 to 30).

Numerous Sovereign mortgage advertisements for a loan for which more
than one interest rate would apply stated a simple annual rate of interest, but
failed to state the period during which each simple annual rate of interest
would apply; failed to state an accurate APR for the loan because the stated
APR was not correctly calculated under the accuracy standards set forth in
Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1026.17(c) and 1026.22; or failed to state these
terms clearly and conspicuously.

For example, Sovereign advertisements for a variable-rate mortgage sent to
at least 87,000 consumers in September 2018 stated on the front a simple

annual interest rate of 2.75% and an APR of 3.5% that applied to the first

five years of the advertised loan, but the advertised APR was not correct
because it did not take into account the fully indexed rate, discount points
required to obtain the advertised interest rate, and origination fees.

The actual APR for this loan, calculated in accordance with Regulation Z
and taking into account the fully indexed rate, discount points required to
obtain the advertised interest rate, and origination fees, exceeded 3.75%.
The APR disclosed in the advertisements did not comply with the accuracy
standards set forth in 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.22(a)(2).

The advertisements also did not contain an equally prominent and closely
proximate statement of the period during which the 2.75% interest rate
would apply. The fact that the advertised interest rate applied only to the
first five years was disclosed in fine print on the back of the advertisements.
Numerous Sovereign mortgage advertisements stated the amount of a
payment, but failed to state the amount of each payment that would apply
over the term of the loan (e.g., for adjustable-rate mortgages, payments
based on the application of the sum of a reasonably current index and
margin); or failed to state the period during which each payment would
apply.

For example, Sovereign advertisements for a variable-rate mortgage sent to

at least 87,000 consumers in September 2018 stated an estimated payment
72.

amount that was based on an introductory, discount rate of 2.75% that
applied only to the first five years of the advertised loan. That payment was
not calculated based on the index and margin that would be used to make
subsequent payment adjustments over the remaining term of the loan, and
the advertisements failed to state any payment amount based on a reasonably
current index and margin. As of the date of the advertisements, the fully
indexed rate, based on a reasonably current index and margin, was at least
4.3%. The advertisements failed to disclose the payment amounts associated
with that rate after the first five years. Moreover, the advertisements failed
to state the period during which each payment would apply.

Numerous Sovereign mortgage advertisements used the name of the
consumerâs current lender without disclosing with equal prominence the
name of the person making the advertisement and without including a clear
and conspicuous statement that the person making the advertisement was not
associated with or acting on behalf of the consumerâs current lender.

Sovereign violated Â§ 1026.24(a) because, as described in Paragraphs 23-38,
numerous Sovereign advertisements for credit stated specific credit terms
other than those terms that actually were or would be arranged or offered by

the creditor.
Terms of Repayment, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(d)

Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(d)(1), if an advertisement sets forth any of the
four specified triggering terms (the amount or percentage of any
downpayment, the number of payments or period of repayment, the amount
of any payment, or the amount of any finance charge), the advertisement
must also state, among other things, â[t]he terms of repayment, which reflect
the repayment obligations over the full term of the loan, including any

balloon payment.â 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(d)(1), (2)(i1).

Inadequate Disclosure of Rates, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(f)(2)()

Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(f)(2)(1), ifa direct-mail mortgage advertisement:

states a simple annual rate of interest and more than one
simple annual rate of interest will apply over the term of the
advertised loan, the advertisement shall disclose in a clear and
conspicuous manner:

(A) Each simple annual rate of interest that will apply.
In variable-rate transactions, a rate determined by
adding an index and margin shall be disclosed based on

a reasonably current index and margin;

Sovereign violated Â§ 1026.24(f)(2)(1) because, as described in Paragraphs

that âstates the amount of any paymentâ must disclose, in a clear and
conspicuous manner:

(A) The amount of each payment that will apply over the term

82. Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(1)(1), mortgage advertisements may not:

Us[e] the word âfixedâ to refer to rates, payments, or the

increase, unless:

(i) In the case of an advertisement solely for one or more
variable-rate transactions,

(A) The phrase âAdjustable-Rate Mortgage,â
âVariable-Rate Mortgage,â or âARMâ appears in the
advertisement before the first use of the word âfixedâ

and is at least as conspicuous as any use of the word
âfixedâ in the advertisement; and

(B) Each use of the word âfixedâ to refer to a rate or
payment is accompanied by an equally prominent and
closely proximate statement of the time period for
which the rate or payment is fixed, and the fact that the

rate may vary or the payment may increase after that
period....

83. Sovereign violated Â§ 1026.24(1)(1) because, as described in Paragraphs 35-

VIOLATIONS OF THE CFPA

Under the CFPA, it is unlawful for any covered person or service provider to
engage in a deceptive act or practice in connection with any transaction with
a consumer for a consumer-financial product or service, or the offering of a
consumer-financial product or service. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).
An act or practice is deceptive if it involves a material misrepresentation or
omission that is likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under the
circumstances.

Information that is likely to affect a consumerâs choice of, or conduct

regarding, a product or service is material to consumers.
Deceptive Representations About Credit Terms

In numerous instances, as described in Paragraphs 23-36 and 39-40,
Sovereignâs mortgage advertisements represented, expressly or by
implication, that specific credit terms were available or would be arranged or
offered by the creditor, including representations about specific APRs,

payment amounts, or the variable or fixed nature of rates or payments, when
2020-BCFP-0005 Document1 Filed 07/24/2020 Page 29 of 56

in fact those specific credit terms were not available or were not terms that
Sovereign was actually prepared to arrange or offer.

102. Sovereignâs misrepresentations about the availability of the advertised credit
terms of the advertised mortgage were likely to mislead consumers acting
reasonably under the circumstances.

103. Sovereignâs misrepresentations about the credit terms of the advertised
mortgage were material because they were likely to affect the conduct or
decisions of consumers.

104. Therefore, Sovereign engaged in deceptive acts and practices in violation of
the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).

Deceptive Representations About Consumersâ
Ability or Likelihood to Obtain the Advertised Mortgage or Credit Term

105. In numerous instances, as described in Paragraphs 41-48, Sovereignâs
mortgage advertisements represented, expressly or by implication, that
consumers who received the advertisements had been prequalified or
prescreened for the advertised mortgage based on information in their credit
report or that the credit terms stated in the advertisements were available to

borrowers with a âLow FICO Score.â

In fact, consumers who received these advertisements had not been selected
or screened for the advertised mortgage and were not able to obtain the
credit terms stated in the advertisements with a âLow FICO Score.â
Sovereignâs representations about prequalifying or prescreening consumers
and the availability of stated credit terms for consumers with a âLow FICO
Scoreâ were likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under the
circumstances.

Sovereignâs misrepresentations about prequalifying or prescreening
consumers and the availability of stated credit terms for consumers with a
âLow FICO Scoreâ were material because they were likely to affect the
conduct or decisions of consumers.

Therefore, Sovereign engaged in deceptive acts and practices in violation of

the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).
Deceptive Representations About Government Affiliation

In numerous instances, as described in Paragraphs 49-54, Sovereignâs
mortgage advertisements represented, expressly or by implication, that
Sovereign was affiliated with the government.

In fact, Sovereign was not affiliated with the government.

Sovereignâs misrepresentations about government affiliation were likely to

mislead consumers acting reasonably under the circumstances.

Sovereignâs misrepresentations about government affiliation were material
because they were likely to affect the conduct or decisions of consumers.
Therefore, Sovereign engaged in deceptive acts and practices in violation of

the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).

Deceptive Representations About Late Payments,
Rate Adjustments, and Payment Increases

In numerous instances, as described in Paragraphs 55-61, Sovereignâs
mortgage advertisements contained false statements that the consumer was
late on her loan payments and that there were unauthorized rate adjustments
or unnecessary payment increases on her loan.

These representations had no basis and were false for many consumers.
Sovereignâs misrepresentations about late payments, unauthorized rate
adjustments, and unnecessary payment increases were likely to mislead
consumers acting reasonably under the circumstances.

Sovereignâs misrepresentations about late payments, unauthorized rate
adjustments, and unnecessary payment increases were likely to influence the
conduct or decisions of consumers.

Therefore, Sovereign engaged in deceptive acts and practices in violation of

the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).

thereunder, violates the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5536(a)(1 (A), 5481(14).
Regulation Z and the MAP Rule are Federal consumer financial laws.
Sovereignâs violations of Regulation Z and the MAP Rule, described in

In any direct-mail mortgage advertisement that states a cash-out
amount for a cash-out refinance mortgage and a monthly payment
amount only for the portion of that mortgage used to obtain that cash-

a new loan purchased from Respondent, and (2) the total monthly
payment amount(s) for such a refinanced mortgage.

If Respondent screens or selects consumers to receive any direct-mail

Within 10 days of the Effective Date, Respondent must pay the civil money
penalty by wire transfer to the Bureau or to the Bureauâs agent in
compliance with the Bureauâs wiring instructions.
The civil money penalty paid under this Consent Order will be deposited in
the Civil Penalty Fund of the Bureau as required by Â§ 1017(d) of the CFPA,
12 U.S.C. Â§ 5497(d).
Respondent, for all purposes, must treat the civil money penalty paid under
this Consent Order as a penalty paid to the government. Regardless of how
the Bureau ultimately uses those funds, Respondent may not:
a. Claim, assert, or apply for a tax deduction, tax credit, or any other tax
benefit for any civil money penalty paid under this Consent Order; or
b. Seek or accept, directly or indirectly, reimbursement or
indemnification from any source, including but not limited to
payment made under any insurance policy, with regard to any civil
money penalty paid under this Consent Order.
To preserve the deterrent effect of the civil money penalty in any Related
Consumer Action, Respondent may not argue that Respondent is entitled to,
nor may Respondent benefit by, any offset or reduction of any compensatory
monetary remedies imposed in the Related Consumer Action because of the

civil money penalty paid in this action or because of any payment that the

Bureau makes from the Civil Penalty Fund. If the court in any Related
Consumer Action offsets or otherwise reduces the amount of compensatory
monetary remedies imposed against Respondent based on the civil money
penalty paid in this action or based on any payment that the Bureau makes
from the Civil Penalty Fund, Respondent must, within 30 days after entry of
a final order granting such offset or reduction, notify the Bureau, and pay the
amount of the offset or reduction to the U.S. Treasury. Such a payment will
not be considered an additional civil money penalty and will not change the
amount of the civil money penalty imposed in this action.

Additional Monetary Provisions

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that:
In the event of any default on Respondentâs obligations to make payment
under this Consent Order, interest, computed under 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1961, as
amended, will accrue on any outstanding amounts not paid from the date of
default to the date of payment, and will immediately become due and
payable.
Respondent must relinquish all dominion, control, and title to the funds paid
to the fullest extent permitted by law and no part of the funds may be

returned to Respondent.
