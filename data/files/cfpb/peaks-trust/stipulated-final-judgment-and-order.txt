FINDINGS
This Court has jurisdiction over the Parties and the subject matter of
the Action.
The Complaint alleges claims upon which, if the Bureau were to
prevail, relief may be granted under the CFPA. The relief provided in
this Order is appropriate and available pursuant to sections 1054 and
1055 of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5564 and 5565.
The Parties agree to entry of this Order, without adjudication of any
issue of fact or law, to settle and to resolve all matters arising from the
conduct alleged in the Complaint.
Defendants neither admit nor deny any of the allegations in the
Complaint except that, for the purposes of this Order, Defendants

5
16.

17.

18.

admit the facts necessary to establish this Courtâs jurisdiction over
them and over the subject matter of the Action.

PEAKS is an entity that was created for the PEAKS Private Student
Loan Program for the purposes of, among other things, purchasing
and holding beneficial ownership of the Loans. In connection with the
PEAKS Private Student Loan Program, DBNTC, as lender trustee,
holds legal title to the Loans on behalf of and for the benefit of
PEAKS. Subject to certain conditions and limitations contained in
certain PEAKS Private Student Loan Program agreements, servicing
of the Loans is performed by the Servicer. PEAKS and the other
Defendants will take the actions in this Order with respect to the
Loans in accordance with their roles and responsibilities in the
program documents, including, where applicable, acting through
agents and contractors including the Servicer

The current balance of the Loans, including principal, outstanding
interest, and outstanding fees, is approximately $330 million.

PEAKS has not acquired, and will not acquire, loans other than the
Loans, does not conduct business other than the PEAKS Private
Student Loan Program, and intends to cease conducting that business

Case 1:20-cv-02386-JRS-MJD Document9 Filed 10/01/20 Page 7 of 19 PagelD #: 75

20.

upon the completion of its obligations as set out in this Order. Given
that PEAKS will not conduct any additional business, the Bureau has
agreed not to seek injunction, compliance, and reporting requirements
beyond those specified in this Order.
Defendants waive service under Rule 4(d) of the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure and waive all rights to seek judicial review of or
otherwise to challenge or to contest the validity of this Order.
Defendants also waive any claim they may have under the Equal
Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. Â§ 2412, concerning the prosecution
of the Action to the date of this Order.
Entry of this Order is in the public interest.

ORDER

I.

ORDER TO CEASE AND DESIST AND
TO TAKE OTHER AFFIRMATIVE ACTION

IT IS ORDERED that:

21.

As of the Effective Date :
a. PEAKS will terminate all collections activities and terminate
the acceptance of payments from consumers related to any

Loan; and
b. Defendants will take no further action, directly or through any
agent or contractor, to enforce or to collect any Loan.

c. Notwithstanding the requirements of subparagraphs (a) and (b)
of this Paragraph, Defendants will not be regarded as in
violation of this Order if they or the Servicer send out routine
statements or notices that could be considered collection
activity within 20 days after the Effective Date; nor will
Defendants be regarded as in violation of this Order in the event
that a payment from a consumer related to any Loan is
discovered to have been accepted or processed after the
Effective Date, provided that Defendants or the Servicer make
efforts to return the payment to the consumer as specified in the
Redress Plan.

Within 30 days of the Effective Date, PEAKS, DBNTC, as lender
trustee, and DBTCA, as indenture trustee and collateral agent, will
discharge and cancel all outstanding balances of all Affected
Consumersâ Loan accounts, including associated fees, charges, and
interest.

Within 30 days of the Effective Date, PEAKS will cause the Servicer

8
24.

25.

to submit written requests to all Consumer Reporting Agencies to
which Defendants or the Servicer has reported information about the
Affected Consumersâ Loans, directing those Consumer Reporting
Agencies to delete the consumer trade lines associated with the
Affected Consumersâ Loans by updating those consumer trade lines
with the appropriate codes to reflect that each of those consumer trade
lines has been deleted and, if an explanation is required, with the
codes referencing a negotiated court settlement.

Within 30 days of the Effective Date, PEAKS will send notifications
to the Affected Consumers, by first class mail to the most recently
available postal address contained in the Servicerâs system of record
for each Affected Consumer, informing them of the new status of their
Loans, and the requested updated status of the credit reporting related
to their Loans, consistent with this Order.

Except as and to the extent provided herein and in the Redress Plan,
Defendants will relinquish all dominion, control, and title to all Loan
payments made after the Effective Date. No part of those funds may

be retained by Defendants.
26.

27.

In the event that Loan payments made after the Effective Date are
Unreturnable Funds as defined in the Redress Plan, Defendants will
pay any such funds to the Bureau, by wire transfer to the Bureau or to
the Bureauâs agent, according to the Bureauâs wiring instructions.

The Bureau may make continued attempts to distribute those funds to
consumers. If the Bureau determines, in its sole discretion, that such
additional distribution is wholly or partially impracticable or
otherwise inappropriate, or if funds remain after the additional
distribution is completed, the Bureau will deposit the remaining
unreturnable funds with the United States Treasury as a miscellaneous
receipt. Defendants will have no right to challenge any actions that the
Bureau or its representatives may take under this Section.

Upon the Effective Date, Defendants will promptly begin
implementation of the Redress Plan. The Enforcement Director has
reviewed the Redress Plan and has made a determination of non-
objection. Defendants will implement and adhere to the steps,
recommendations, deadlines, and timeframes outlined in the Redress

Plan.

their Loans.

b. Provides an exemplar of written communications to be sent to
Affected Consumers regarding their Loans or the redress
provided in this Order.

c. Identifies a Servicer telephone number that will be active for
150 days after the Effective Date to assist Affected Consumers

describes the types of questions to which the Servicer will be
prepared to respond.

d. Specifies the efforts that Defendants and the Servicer will
undertake to prevent any payment made on a Loan from being
accepted after the Effective Date, and the methods by which
Defendants and the Servicer will attempt to return to the payor
any payment received after the Effective Date.
