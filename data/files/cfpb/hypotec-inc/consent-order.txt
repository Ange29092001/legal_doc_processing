Since January 2016, Hypotec has mailed milhons of mortgage
advertisements to consumers in about [0 states.
Hundreds of thousands of consumers have recerved at least one of Hypotecâs
direct-mail advertisements, and thousands of consumers have obtained
mortgages through Hypotec.

False, Misleading, and Inaccurate Representations
Federal consumer financial law contams numerous provisions banning the
use of misleading and deceptive statements in mortgage advertisements.
Despite those prohibitions, Hypotec was responsible for both the content of,
and the dissermmation of, numerous mortgage advertisements during the
Relevant Period that contained false, misleading, and inaccurate statements,

as described below.

Faise, Misleading, and Inaccurate Representations About Cost
Most of Hypotecâs mortgage advertisements stated specific credit terms,
such as an interest rate, annual percentage rate (APR), and payment amount.
By stating specific credit terms in its advertisements, Hypotec represented,
expressly or by implication, that it arranged or offered a mortgage with those
credit terms,
In fact, Hypotec did not arrange or offer mortgages with the specific credit
terms stated in many of those advertisements.

athe A A

In numerous imstances, Hypotec misrepresented the actual credit terms
applicable to the mortgages that it would arrange or offer.

Malhons of Hypotec mortgage advertisements described mortgages with a
simple interest rate and APR combination that, on the date of the
advertisement and in the 60 days preceding, Hypotec was not actually
prepared to arrange or offer.

For example, Hypotec sent about $50,000 advertisements to consumers
between June 2018 and January 2019 that advertised a mortgage with a
2,/5% mtroductory interest rate and an APR of 2.788%.

But Hypotec did not offer such a loan, as reflected in the rate sheets of its
lenders.

Hypotec also sent about 2 milhon advertisements to consumers between
December 2016 and May 2018 offering an adjustable-rate mortgage with a
three-year introductory interest rate of 2.25% andan APR of 2.461%.

But Hypotec aiso did not offer such a loan, as reflected in the rate sheets of
its lenders.

Accordingly, Hypotec misrepresented the actual APR for loans offered in
these advertisements.

Hypotec sent about 2.9 million of these advertisements to servicemembers

and veterans.

Consumers who received the advertisements described in Paragraphs 27â33
were likely to be misled by them.

The advertisements were also likely to affect consumersâ conduct or
decisions with regard to obtamme a loan.

Faise and Misleading Representations About an
Affiliation with the Government

Numerous Hypotec mortgage advertisements falsely represented, directly or

by implication, using formats and phrases, that Hypotec was affihated with

the United States government, including the VA, that the advertised product

was endorsed, sponsored by, or affihated with the United States government,

or that the United States government was the source of the advertisements.

For example, each of about 3.2 milhon Hypotec advertisements sent to

servicemembers and veterans contained the following statements:

dk. âVA-1211 Benefit Allotment Noticeâ positioned in the upper corner
of the letter;

b. âUnderstanding your VA Benefit Statementâ centered prominently im
bold letters across the top of the letter;

c. That the recipient has been âtagged for mclusion m our VA IRREL

These statements and other characteristics relatmg to the mailing strongly

implied that the solicitations were being sent by or on behalf of the United

States government, inchiding the VA.

In fact, those representations were false because Hypotec was not affillated

with the United States government, nor were the products offered im these

advertisements endorsed by, sponsored by, or affihated with the

government, inchiding the VA.

The advertisements were also likely to affect consumersâ conduct or

False and Misleading Representations About an
Escrow Refund Amount

About 3.2 milion of the advertisements Hypotec sent between June 2016
and January 2019 stated that a recipient will receive an âEST. ESCROW
REPOND AMOUN'Tâ of a specific amount if that consumer refinances his
or her mortgage.
The escrow refund amounts that Hypotec advertised were calculated using a
methodology that had no bearmg on the actual escrow refund amount.
Moreover, Hypotec frequently required a consumer to fund a new escrow
account upon generating a new loan.
Consumers who received the advertisements described in Paragraphs 42-44
were likely to be misied by them.
The advertisements were also likely to affect consumersâ conduct or
decisions with regard to obtamimyg a loan.
Faise Representations About the

Time-Limited Availability of the VA-Loan Program
About 450,000 of the advertisements Hypotec sent stated: âthe Economic
Stimulus Program will end soon. There is currently no plan to extend the

Stimulus Program.â

This statement regarding the purported time-limited availability of the VA
loan program was untrue.
Consumers who received the advertisements described in Paragraphs 47 and
4% were likely to be misled by them.
The advertisements were also likely to affect consumersâ conduct or
decisions with regard to obtaining a loan.

Inadequate Disclosures
Many of Hypotecâs mortgage advertisements stated the amount of a new
loan payment and an mtroductory interest rate for adrustable mortgages.
Under certain sections of Regulation Z, including Â§ 1026.24(c), (d), and (),
the use of these terms triggers specific disclosure requirements. About 3.2
mulhon of Hypotecâs advertisements mcluded these trigger terms, but did not
mclude the other disclosures that are required, or did not include them m the
manner required.
In addition, about 1.8 millon of Hypotecâs mortgage advertisements stated
the name of the consumerâs current lender, but did not inclide the additional
disclosures required by Regulation Zim Â§ 1026.24@)(4).

Disclosures Triggered by Payment Amount

Numerous Hypotec morigage advertisements stated the amount of a new

loan payment, but failed to state the terms of repayment reflecting the

recipientâs repayment obhgations over the full term of the loan, as required
by section 1026.24(d).

For example, 3.2 milion Hypotec advertisements sent to consumers stated a
ânew principal and interest paymentâ reflecting a new monthly payment
amount, a simple interest rate,an APR, and the phrase â3 year ARMâ in
smaller font at the bottom of the page.

But these advertisements did not state the period of the loan or the number
of required payments. Moreover, the payment amount advertised was
applicable for only the first three years of the loan, but the advertisements
did not disclose the subsequent payments required over the full term of the
loan, as required by Â§ 1026.24(a)(2yan.

Ot these advertisements, 2.9 million also failed to disclose in a clear and
conspicuous manner the amount of each payment that would apply over the
term of the loan, the period during which each payment would apply, and the
fact, applicable to these loans, that the payments did not mclude amounts for
taxes and insurance premiums and that the actual payment obhgation would
be greater, as required by Â§ 1026.24()(3).

For example, the advertisements proviied the amount of the recipientâs new
monthly payment, but included neither the amount of each payment that

would apply over the term of the loan (despite stating in small print that the

loan was fora â3 year ARMâ), nor the period durmg which each payment
would apply. Furthermore, the advertisements failed to disclose that the
advertised payment amounts excluded taxes and msurance and that the

actual payment obligation would be greater.

Disclosures Triggered by Introductory Interest Rate
Numerous Hypotec mortgage advertisements offering a loan for which more
than one interest rate would apply included a simple annual rate of interest,
but failed to clearly and conspicuously state each simple annual interest rate
that would apply, the time period durmg which each simple annual interest
rate would apply, and, for variable rate loans, an APR for the loan that
complied with the accuracy standards in 12 C.FLR. Â§Â§ 1026.17(c) and
1026.22, as required by Regulation Z, 12 C.FLR. Â§ 1026.24).
For example, Hypotec sent about 2.9 milton advertisements fora variable-
rate mortgage to consumers offering an introductory annual rate of interest
that would apply for the first three years of the loan, but that did not disclose
each simple mterest rate that would apply over the remaming term of the
loan, whether by including the loanâs fully indexed interest rate on the date
of the advertisement or by including the loanâs index and margin. These
advertisements also stated the period for the introductory rate-âthree

yearsâbut not the twenty-seven-year term for the fully-indexed rate.

In addition, about 850,000 of these advertisements sent to consumers
between June 7, 2018 and January 17, 2019 offered a mortgage with a
2.75% mtroductory mterest rate that apphed to the first three years of the
loan anda 2.788% APR. In fact, the lowest APR that would have been
available from Hypotecâs lenders within 60 days before June 7, 2018 for the
loans promoted in those advertisements was at least 3.766%, which was not
within the accuracy standards m 8Â§ 1026.17(c) and 1026.22. And the lowest
APR that would have been available from Hypotecâs lenders within 60 days
betore January 17,2019 for the loans promoted in those advertisements was
at least 4.282%, also not within the accuracy standards in $$ 1026.17(c) and
1026.22.

The remainmg 2 milhon of these advertisements sent to consumers between
December 9, 2016 and May 3, 2018 offered a mortgage with a 2.25%
introductory interest rate that applied to the first three years of the loan and a

3.766%, which was also not within the accuracy standards in Â§8 1026.17{(c)

Disclosures Triggered by Current Lender Name
Numerous Hypotec mortgage advertisements used the name of the
consumerâs current lender, but failed to disclose Hypotecâs name with equal
prominence, orto include a clear and conspicuous statement that Hypotec
was not associated with, or acting on behalf of, the consumerâ s current
lender, as required by section 1026.24G).
For example, Hypotec sent about 1.8 mulhon advertisements that featured
the name of the consumerâs current lender on the top of the advertisement
and on the envelope in large, bold type.
The advertisements contaimed a disclosure in small type at the bottom of the
advertisement stating that the âofferis made by Hypotec, Inc.â and that the
company was not affiliated with the consumerâs current lender, but this
disclosure was not âwith equal prominenceâ to the use of the current
lenderâs name.
The advertisements also did not contain a clear and conspicuous disclosure
that Hypotec was not associated with, or acting on behalf of, the consumer's

current lender.
