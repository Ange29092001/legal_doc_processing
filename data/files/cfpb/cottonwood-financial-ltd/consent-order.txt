Bureau Findings and Conclusions

The Bureau finds the following:

4.

Respondent is a financial services company headquartered in Irving, Texas.

Respondent owns and operates approximately 340 locations across the following states:
Idaho, Illinois, Michigan, New Mexico, Texas, Utah, and Wisconsin.

Respondent makes or, in certain states, assists consumers in obtaining, short-term, small-
dollar loans, including payday, installment, and auto title loans. Since at least 2013,
Respondent has offered multiple-payment loans in varying amounts, with installment
payments due periodically. Respondent also makes or, in certain states, assists consumers
in obtaining, loans secured by consumersâ vehicles and unsecured, short-term, single-
installment loans.

Respondent is a covered person under the CFPA because it is in the business of making
consumer loans and collecting debt related to such loans. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(6), (15)(A)q),
(15)(A)(X).

Respondent is a creditor under TILA and Regulation Z to the extent that it regularly
extends consumer credit that is payable by agreement in more than four installments or
for which the payment of a finance charge is or may be required, and is the person to
whom the debt arising from the consumer credit transaction is initially payable on the
face of the evidence of indebtedness or, if there is no such evidence of indebtedness, by

agreement. 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1602(g); 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.2(a)(17).
10.

11.

12.

13.

14.

15.

16.

17.

Respondent is a person under FCRA, 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1681a(b).

Respondent furnishes information relating to consumers to CRAs for inclusion in
consumer reports. Respondent is therefore a furnisher under Regulation V, 12 C.F.R. Â§
1022.41(c).

Findings and Conclusions as to Unfair Collection Call Practices

As part of its loan-application process, Respondent asked consumers to list their primary
telephone number and to provide the names and contact information for at least two
references.

As references, consumers often identified their employers, family, or friends, and listed
their employersâ telephone numbers, along with the telephone numbers of family or
friends.

When consumers failed to make payments on loans originated by Respondent, it
frequently made numerous calls to the consumers themselves, their employers, and other
third parties.

Respondent called some consumers more than 15 times daily, and a smaller portion more
than 20 times daily.

Until at least December 2015, Respondent routinely called consumersâ employers,
consumersâ other references, and other third parties as a tactic to obtain payments from
the consumer rather than when unable to locate the consumer.

In numerous instances when making such calls, Respondent disclosed to third parties, or
risked disclosing to third parties, the existence of consumersâ delinquent debts.

In some instances, Respondent called consumersâ workplaces multiple times a day, even
after being told that the consumers were not allowed to receive calls at work and that

future calls could endanger their employment.
18.

19.

20.

21.

22.

23.

In some instances, Respondent called consumersâ references or other third parties it
thought might be related to consumers even after being asked to stop.

Respondentâs acts or practices have caused or were likely to cause substantial injury to
the consumers from whom it sought to collect and to third parties. Respondentâs repeated
calls to consumersâ workplaces caused or were likely to cause consumers harm including
disciplinary action from employers, lost productivity and wages, and other negative
employment consequences.

Respondentâs high volume of calls to consumers also caused or was likely to cause harm
to consumers as the repeated calls aggravated, annoyed, and distressed consumers.
Respondentâs calling practices also caused or were likely to cause harm to persons who
acted as third-party references.

Consumers, including the third parties who Respondent contacted, could not reasonably
have avoided the harm because they did not know whether, when, or how these calls
might occur and had no control over Respondentâs use of these collection tactics.
Consumers had no way of knowing Respondent would engage in such conduct before
entering the loan transaction as Respondent does not disclose in its loan agreements that
it will use these collection tactics if a loan becomes delinquent.

The injury resulting from these calls is not outweighed by countervailing benefits to
consumers or competition. Many other means to collect debt that do not disrupt
consumersâ workplaces or otherwise harm consumers are available to Respondent. Any
marginal benefit to consumers or to competition stemming from additional recoveries by
Respondent is outweighed by substantial injury or likelihood of injury to consumers

resulting from these practices.
24.

25.

206.

27.

28.

29.

Respondentâs acts or practices therefore constitute unfair acts or practices in violation of
the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).

Findings and Conclusions as to Deceptive Television Marketing

Before June 2015, certain television advertising by Respondent stated that consumers
could save 50% on finance charges.

In fact, Respondent did not give consumers who responded to the advertisements a 50%
discount on all of the finance charges associated with the loan.

Instead, consumers would pay the first finance charge in full. Consumers would then
receive a 50% rebate of that charge, which was mailed to them some time later.
Consumers were required to pay 100% of the remaining finance charges and received no
rebates of those payments.

Certain of Respondentâs television advertisements ended with a screen displaying text
urging consumers to call Respondent and âSave 50%â in large font at the top of the
screen. Underneath, the screen included fine print text indicating that the promised
discount was available only as a rebate, and applied only to the finance charge for the first
scheduled payment. At the same time, the advertisements included voice-overs telling
viewers to call now and âsave up to 50%,â or other substantially similar language, without
reference to the limitations on the purported discount.

Respondentâs representations in the advertisements were likely to mislead consumers
acting reasonably because they presented the false impression that consumers would only
have to pay 50% of a loanâs finance charges. In fact, consumers actually had to pay all of
the finance charges on these loans; the discount code provided them the opportunity to
receive a rebate after they made their first scheduled payment, and then only of 50% of

the finance charge portion of that payment.
30.

31.

32.

33.

34.

35.

36.

From January 1, 2013 to June 1, 2015, more than 1,200 consumers redeemed codes
related to Respondentâs misleading television ads.

The statements in these television advertisements were material because they related to
the cost of Respondentâs loan products.

Respondentâs representations set forth above constitute deceptive acts or practices in
violation of the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531, 5536(a)(1)(B).

Findings and Conclusions as to Deceptive Telemarketing Calls

From at least January 2013 through January 2015, Respondent made thousands of
marketing calls promoting its supposed 50% discounts after consumers expressed interest
in a loan online.

When Respondentâs telemarketers mentioned the discount, they typically described it as a
50% discount on the finance charge payment, and in most cases failed to mention the
limitations that it would apply only to finance charges applicable to the first payment due,
that it would be paid as a rebate, and that it would be provided only if the first payment
was received in full on or before the due date.

Respondentâs telemarketing agents did not direct consumers to review any disclosures
related to the offer, and often encouraged consumers to write down the discount code,
which the agents provided orally, without directing them to go to their website where the
consumer might have seen the disclosures associated with the website coupon.
Respondentâs representations in these calls misled or were likely to mislead consumers
acting reasonably because they presented the false impression that consumers would only
have to pay 50% of a loanâs finance charges. In fact, consumers had to pay all of the

finance charges on these loans; the discount code provided them the opportunity to
37.

38.

receive a rebate after they made their first scheduled payment, and then only of 50% of
the finance charge portion of that payment.

Respondentâs statements were material because they related to the cost of Respondentâs
loan products.

Respondentâs representations set forth above constitute deceptive acts or practices in

violation of the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531, 5536(a)(1)(B).

42.

43.

Policies and Procedures

Respondent furnishes information relating to consumers to one or more CRAs for
inclusion in a consumer report. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1022.41(c). It is therefore a furnisher under
Regulation V.

Regulation V requires a furnisher to establish and implement reasonable written policies
and procedures regarding the accuracy and integrity of the information relating to
consumers that it furnishes to a consumer reporting agency. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1022.42(a).
Regulation V also requires furnishers to consider the guidelines provided in Appendix E
when developing its policies and procedures and to incorporate those guidelines that are
appropriate. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1022.42(b).

Regulation V also requires each furnisher to review its policies and procedures
periodically and update them as necessary to ensure their continued effectiveness. 12
C.F.R. Â§ 1022.42(c).

Between 2013 and 2015, Respondent furnished informationâincluding loan amount,
consumerâs loan status, whether the loan was in default, and whether the consumer had

disputed the debt in some way or entered into bankruptcyâfor about 20,000 accounts.
44,

45.

46.

47.

From at least January 2013 to May 2015, Respondent did not have reasonable written
policies and procedures concerning the accuracy and integrity of the consumer
information that it furnished to CRAs, nor did it consider federal guidelines in developing
its policies and procedures as required by federal law.

Respondent failed to review its policies and procedures periodically and update them as
necessary to ensure their continued effectiveness.

Respondent therefore violated 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1022.42(a)-(c).

Respondentâs violations of the FCRA and Regulation V constitute violations of the

CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(A).

Findings and Conclusions as to Inadequate Disclosures of the APR in Telemarketing Calls

48.

49.

50.

S1.

52.

53.

Respondent is a creditor under Regulation Z. 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1602(g); 12 C.F.R. Â§
1026.2(a)(17).

Respondentâs telemarketers call consumers who have expressed interest in a loan online.
From January 1, 2013 through July 2015, Respondent made hundreds of thousands of
telemarketing calls to consumers.

TILA requires that when creditors respond orally to consumersâ inquiries about the cost of
closed-end credit (for example, the interest rate), they must disclose the cost as an APR.
15 U.S.C. Â§ 1665a; 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.26(b).

Often, when consumers asked Respondentâs telemarketing agents about the interest on
loans or other questions relating to cost, the agents responded orally but failed to provide
the APR as required by federal law.

Respondentâs call scripts provided no guidance on how to answer a consumerâs question

about the interest rate or other costs of the loan.

2020-BCFP-0001 Document1 Filed 04/01/2020 Page 11 of 29

In September 2014, a member of Respondentâs compliance team raised, in writing, a
concern that Respondentâs lack of guidance about how to lawfully disclose a loanâs cost
and APR could result in violations of TILA. Respondent did not revise or update its
script, nor provide further guidance to telemarketers in response to this issue.
The failure to state the APR when orally responding to consumersâ questions about the
costs of the loans violates Regulation Z. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.26.
Respondentâs violations of TILA and Regulation Z constitute violations of the CFPA. 12
ULS.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(A).

Consumers. If the Bureau determines, in its sole discretion, that additional redress is

wholly or partially impracticable or otherwise inappropriate, or if funds remain after the

additional redress is completed, the Bureau will deposit any remaining funds in the U.S.

Treasury as disgorgement. Respondent will have no right to challenge any actions that the

those funds, Respondent may not:

a. Claim, assert, or apply for a tax deduction, tax credit, or any other tax benefit for
any civil money penalty paid under this Consent Order; or

b. Seek or accept, directly or indirectly, rermbursement or indemnification from any

benefit by, any offset or reduction of any compensatory monetary remedies imposed in
the Related Consumer Action because of the civil money penalty paid in this action. If
the court in any Related Consumer Action offsets or otherwise reduces the amount of
compensatory monetary remedies imposed against Respondent based on the civil money
penalty paid in this action or based on any payment that the Bureau makes from the Civil
Penalty Fund, Respondent must, within 30 days after entry of a final order granting such
offset or reduction, notify the Bureau, and pay the amount of the offset or reduction to the
U.S. Treasury. Such a payment will not be considered an additional civil money penalty

and will not change the amount of the civil money penalty imposed in this action.

any outstanding amounts not paid from the date of default to the date of payment, and
will immediately become due and payable.

Respondent must relinquish all dominion, control, and title to the funds paid to the fullest
extent permitted by law and no part of the funds may be returned to Respondent.
