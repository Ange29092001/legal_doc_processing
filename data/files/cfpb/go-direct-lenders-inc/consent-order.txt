The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau) has reviewed certain
direct-mail mortgage advertising activities of Go Direct Lenders, Inc. (Go Direct or
Respondent, as defined below) and identified violations of Â§ 1026.24 of Regulation
Z, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24, the implementing regulation of the Truth in Lending Act
(TILA), 15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1601â1667f; Â§ 1014.3 of the Mortgage Acts and Practicesâ
Advertising Rule (MAP Rule or Regulation N), 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.3; and Â§Â§ 1031
and 1036 of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA), 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§
5531, 5536. Under Â§Â§ 1053 and 1055 of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. 8Â§ 5563, 5565, the

Bureau issues this Consent Order.
Overview
Go Direct is a mortgage lender that offers and provides mortgages
guaranteed by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).
Go Direct advertises these mortgage products to consumers through direct-
mail advertising campaigns targeted primarily at United States military
servicemembers and veterans.
From March 2017 to April 2019, Go Direct sent consumers over 700,000
advertisements that violate federal law because of misleading and deceptive
statements and inadequate disclosures.
The Bureau brings this action to stop Go Direct from distributing
advertisements with misleading and deceptive statements and inadequate
disclosures to servicemembers, veterans, and other consumers.

Bureau Findings and Conclusions

The Bureau finds the following:

Go Direct is a California corporation with its principal place of business in
Sherman Oaks, California.

Go Direct is licensed as a mortgage broker or lender in at least 11 states.
Go Direct is a âperson,â as defined in the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(19),
Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.2(a)(22), and the MAP Rule, 12 C.F.R. Â§
1014.2, because it is a corporation.

During the Relevant Period, Go Direct has been a âcovered personâ under
the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(6)(A), because it is a person that engages in
offering and providing residential-mortgage loans, which are âconsumer

financial product[s] or service[s|â under the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(5), (6),

(15)(A)Q@).
12.

16.

17.

18.

During the Relevant Period, Go Direct has been subject to the MAP Rule
because it is a person over which the Federal Trade Commission has
jurisdiction under the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 41-58.
12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.1. The MAP Rule is a Federal consumer financial law. 12
U.S.C. Â§ 548114).

Go Direct provides âmortgage credit product|s],â as that term is defined in
the MAP Rule. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.2.

Go Directâs mortgage advertisements are âcommercial communicationsâ
regarding a term of a âmortgage credit product,â as those terms are defined
in 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.2.

During the Relevant Period, Go Direct has offered âclosed-end creditâ in the
form of mortgage loans to âconsumers,â as those terms are defined in
Regulation Z. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.2(a)(10) & (11).

Go Directâs mortgage advertisements are advertisements for âclosed-end
credit,â as that term is defined in Regulation Z. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.2(a)(10).
Go Direct offers consumer mortgages, including mortgages guaranteed by
the VA.

Go Directâs principal means of advertising VA-guaranteed mortgages is
through direct-mail advertisements sent to consumers, including veterans

and servicemembers.

24.

From March 2017 to April 2019, Go Direct mailed over 700,000 mortgage
advertisements to consumers in at least 11 states.
Go Direct ceased sending direct-mail advertisements upon receipt of the

Bureauâs Civil Investigative Demand dated April 16, 2019.

False, Misleading, and Inaccurate Representations
Federal consumer financial law contains numerous provisions banning the
use of misleading and deceptive statements in mortgage advertisements.
Despite those prohibitions, Go Direct was responsible for both the content
of, and the dissemination of, numerous mortgage advertisements during the
Relevant Period that contained false, misleading, and inaccurate statements,
as described below.

False, Misleading, and Inaccurate
Representations About Cost and Other Credit Terms

Most of Go Directâs mortgage advertisements stated specific credit terms,
such as an interest rate, annual percentage rate (APR), and costs or fees
associated with the mortgage.

By stating specific credit terms in its advertisements, Go Direct represented,
expressly or by implication, that it arranged or offered a mortgage with those

credit terms.
25.

26.

27.

28.

29.

30.

In fact, Go Direct did not arrange or offer mortgages with the specific credit
terms stated in many of those advertisements.

In numerous instances, Go Direct misrepresented the actual credit terms
applicable to the mortgages that it would arrange or offer.

Numerous Go Direct mortgage advertisements described mortgages with a
simple interest rate and APR combination that, on the date of the
advertisement, Go Direct was not actually prepared to arrange or offer.

For example, Go Direct advertisements sent to about 30,000 consumers in
June 2018 advertised a mortgage with a fixed interest rate of 2.75% and an
APR of 2.885%. These advertisements stated in the fine print that this offer
was only available to borrowers with a credit score of 740 or higher.

But for borrowers with a credit score of 740 or higher, the actual APR for
this loan, calculated in accordance with Regulation Z and taking into
consideration discount points required to obtain the advertised interest rate
and prepaid finance charges, was at least 3.162%.

These advertisements also stated in large font on the front page that the
2.75% interest rate and 2.885% APR were available to borrowers with
âFICO scores as low as 500.â But as indicated in the fine print, the

advertised interest rate and APR were not available to borrowers with a
31.

32.

33.

34.

35.

credit score below 740. The APR for this loan may have been even higher
than 3.162% for borrowers with FICO scores below 660.

Accordingly, Go Direct misrepresented the actual APR for loans offered in
these advertisements.

Numerous Go Direct mortgage advertisements misrepresented variable-rate
loans as âfixedâ rate loans.

For example, Go Direct advertisements sent to about 30,000 consumers in
February 2019 used the word âfixedâ in bold font and capitalized letters next
to the advertised interest rate on the first page, but in fine print on the second
page, indicated that the advertised loan was, in fact, a variable-rate
mortgage.

In these advertisements, the phrase âAdjustable-Rate Mortgage,â âVariable-
Rate Mortgage,â or âARMâ did not appear before the first use of the word
âfixed,â nor was it at least as conspicuous as any use of the word âfixedâ in
the advertisements.

In these advertisements, each use of the word âfixedâ to refer to a rate or
payment was not accompanied by an equally prominent and closely
proximate statement of the period for which the rate or payment would be
fixed and the fact that the rate may vary or the payment may increase after

that period.
36.

37.

38.

39.

40.

Numerous Go Direct mortgage advertisements misrepresented the existence
and amount of fees or costs to the consumer.

For example, Go Direct advertisements sent to about 30,000 consumers in
November 2017 stated, without qualification or condition, that there was
âNo Application or Processing Feeâ for the advertised loan.

But the vast majority of consumers who obtained a loan from Go Direct paid
a processing fee, and virtually every consumer who purchased a VA loan
from Go Direct in the three-month period following this advertisement paid
a processing fee. Therefore, the statement âNo Application or Processing
Feeâ was false or misleading.

In another example, numerous Go Direct mortgage advertisements included
the following blanket statement, or a very similar statement: âNo Appraisal,
No Assets, & No Income Documentation Needed.â While this statement is
generally true for Interest Rate Reduction Refinance Loan loans, it is not
true for VA cash-out refinance loans, which require appraisals, sufficient
assets, and income documentation. Go Direct rarely made this distinction to
qualify the blanket statement, even though the advertisements explicitly
offered cash-out refinance loans.

Consumers who received the advertisements described in paragraphs 27- 39

were likely to be misled by them.
41.

42.

43.

The advertisements were also likely to affect consumersâ conduct or
decisions with regard to obtaining a loan.

False and Misleading Representations
About an Affiliation with the Government

Numerous Go Direct mortgage advertisements falsely represented, directly
or by implication, through the use of formats and phrases, that Go Direct
was affiliated with the government or that the advertised product was
endorsed, sponsored by, or affiliated with the government.

For example, Go Direct advertisements sent to about 28,000 consumers in
July 2018 were enclosed in envelopes that prominently displayed the year
2018 across the bottom with the â20â in white block letters and the â18â in
black box letters, a distinctive format used by the Internal Revenue Service
(IRS). The envelope stated that it was a âNotificationâ and that the contents
pertained to a âNOTICEâ about âVA BENEFIT ELIGIBILITY.â The
enclosed advertisement stated that it was an âELIGIBILITY ADVISORYâ
about âVA BENEFITSâ in a banner across the top. It also included a boxed
headline that stated the contents were about a â2018 â VA Policy Change
Advisory.â And in the text that followed, it stated: âThe U.S. Department of
Veterans Affairs offers you an Interest Rate Reduction based on your

mortgage payment history.â Although the enclosed advertisement stated in
44,

45.

46.

47.

48.

2020-BCFP-0008 Document1 Filed 08/21/2020 Page 12 of 49

fine print that âThis is an advertisement,â these statements and other
characteristics relating to the mailing strongly implied that the solicitations
originated from a lender affiliated with the VA or the IRS.

In fact, those representations were false because Go Direct was not affiliated
with the government.

Consumers who received the advertisements described in paragraphs 42-44
were likely to be misled by them.

The advertisements were also likely to affect consumersâ conduct or
decisions with regard to obtaining a loan.

False Representations About an Increase in Property Value

Numerous Go Direct mortgage advertisements misrepresented that Go
Direct had ârecordsâ showing that the value of the consumerâs property had
increased over the past year by a specific percentage stated in the
advertisement, creating equity that they could cash out if they refinanced
with a Go Direct mortgage.

For example, Go Direct advertisements sent to about 30,000 consumers in
June 2018 stated, âOur records indicate that the value of your property at
[recipientâs home address] has appreciated by 23% since last year.â
Between November 2017 and April 2019, Go Direct disseminated over

460,000 advertisements that contained this same representation, except that
49.

50.

SI.

2020-BCFP-0008 Document1 Filed 08/21/2020 Page 13 of 49

some of the advertisements stated that the value of the consumerâs property
had increased by 21% or 22%.

Despite claiming that it had ârecordsâ to support these representations, Go
Direct had no such records. Go Directâs representations regarding the
percentage increase in the value of the consumerâs property were also false.
Go Direct disseminated these advertisements to virtually every region of the
country. In doing so, its property-value-appreciation representations were
not tailored to any particular house, neighborhood, city, state, or region.
Instead, Go Direct represented the same appreciation percentage to everyone
who received an advertisement based on a given templateâalways 21%,
22%, or 23%, depending on the template used. But residential property
appreciation rates vary significantly depending on location. In light of such
large variations between cities, states, and regions, Go Direct misrepresented
the property appreciation rates for many consumers by using the same rate
for all consumers who received an advertisement based on one of the three
templates.

Consumers who received the advertisements described in paragraphs 47-49
were likely to be misled by them.

The advertisements were also likely to affect consumersâ conduct or

decisions with regard to obtaining a loan.

Inadequate Disclosures

Many of Go Directâs mortgage advertisements stated a period of repayment
or simple annual rate of interest. Under certain sections of Regulation Z,
including Â§ 1026.24(d) and (f), the use of these terms triggers specific
disclosure requirements. Many of the advertisements did not include the
other disclosures that are required.

Numerous Go Direct mortgage advertisements stated the period of
repayment, but failed to state the terms of repayment reflecting the
consumerâs repayment obligations over the full term of the loan. For
example, Go Direct advertisements sent to about 34,000 consumers in May
2018 advertised a mortgage for a â15-year term in an amount up to
$453,100.â Although these advertisements stated the period of repayment,
they did not disclose the consumerâs repayment obligations over the full
term of the loan.

Numerous Go Direct mortgage advertisements for a loan for which more
than one interest rate would apply stated a simple annual rate of interest, but
failed to state an accurate APR for the loan because the stated APR was not
correctly calculated under Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1026.17(c) and

1026.22.
55.

56.

57.

58.

For example, Go Direct advertisements for a variable-rate mortgage sent to
about 30,000 consumers in February 2019 stated an introductory annual rate
of interest of 2.75% that applied to the first three years of the advertised loan
and an APR of 3.055%. In fact, the APR for the loans promoted in those
advertisements was at least 4.26%. The APR disclosed in the
advertisements did not comply with the accuracy standards set forth in 12
C.F.R. Â§ 1026.22(a)(2).

VIOLATIONS OF REGULATION Z
Unavailable Credit Terms, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(a)

Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(a), â[i]f an advertisement for credit states
specific credit terms, it shall state only those terms that actually are or will
be arranged or offered by the creditor.â

Go Direct violated Â§ 1026.24(a) because, as described in Paragraphs 23-39,
numerous Go Direct advertisements for credit stated specific credit terms
other than those terms that actually were or would be arranged or offered by

the creditor.
Terms of Repayment, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(d)

Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(d)(1), if an advertisement sets forth any of the

four specified triggering terms (the amount or percentage of any
59.

60.

downpayment, the number of payments or period of repayment, the amount
of any payment, or the amount of any finance charge), the advertisement
must also state, among other things, â[t|he terms of repayment, which reflect
the repayment obligations over the full term of the loan, including any
balloon payment.â 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(d)(1), (2)(11).

Go Direct violated Â§ 1026.24(d) because, as described in Paragraph 53,
numerous Go Direct mortgage advertisements set forth the period of
repayment, which is a triggering term under Â§ 1026.24(d)(1)(11), but failed to
state the repayment obligations over the full term of the loan, pursuant to Â§

1026.24(d)(2)(i1).
Inadequate Disclosure of Rates, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(f)(2)(i)

Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(f)(2)(i), if a direct-mail mortgage advertisement:

states a simple annual rate of interest and more than one
simple annual rate of interest will apply over the term of the
advertised loan, the advertisement shall disclose in a clear and
conspicuous manner:

(A) Each simple annual rate of interest that will apply.
In variable-rate transactions, a rate determined by
adding an index and margin shall be disclosed based on
a reasonably current index and margin;

(B) The period of time during which each simple
annual rate of interest will apply; and

(C) The [APR] for the loan. If such rate is variable, the
[APR] shall comply with the accuracy standards in
61.

62.

$Â§ 1026.17(c) and 1026.22.

Go Direct violated Â§ 1026.24(f)(2)(i) because, as described in Paragraphs 54
and 55, numerous Go Direct direct-mail mortgage advertisements for a loan
for which more than one interest rate would apply stated a simple annual rate
of interest, but did not disclose an APR that was correctly calculated under

the accuracy standards set forth in Regulation Z.
Misleading Use of the Word âFixed,â 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24()(1)

Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24()(1), mortgage advertisements may not:

Us[e] the word âfixedâ to refer to rates, payments, or the
credit transaction in an advertisement for variable-rate
transactions or other transactions where the payment will
increase, unless:

(1) In the case of an advertisement solely for one or more
variable-rate transactions,

(A) The phrase âAdjustable-Rate Mortgage,â
âVariable-Rate Mortgage,â or âARMâ appears in the
advertisement before the first use of the word âfixedâ
and is at least as conspicuous as any use of the word
âfixedâ in the advertisement; and

(B) Each use of the word âfixedâ to refer to a rate or
payment is accompanied by an equally prominent and
closely proximate statement of the time period for
which the rate or payment is fixed, and the fact that the
rate may vary or the payment may increase after that
period....
63.

64.

65.

66.

Go Direct violated Â§ 1026.24(1)(1) because, as described in Paragraphs 32-
35, numerous Go Direct mortgage advertisements for variable-rate

transactions used the word âfixedâ to refer to rates, payments, or the credit
transaction and did not comply with the requirements of Â§ 1026.24(i)(1)(1).

VIOLATIONS OF THE MAP RULE (REGULATION N)
Misrepresentations About Rates, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.3(b)

Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.3(b), it is a violation for any person subject to the
MAP Rule to make any misrepresentation, directly or indirectly, expressly
or by implication, in any commercial communication, about â[t]he annual
percentage rate, simple annual rate, periodic rate, or any other rateâ
applicable to a mortgage credit product. Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.3, such a
misrepresentation is specifically prohibited and is therefore material.

Go Direct violated Â§ 1014.3(b) because, as described in Paragraphs 27-31,
numerous Go Direct mortgage advertisements contained misrepresentations

about the APR applicable to a mortgage credit product.
Misrepresentations About Fees or Costs, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.3(c)

Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.3(c), it is a violation for any person subject to the
MAP Rule to make any misrepresentation, directly or indirectly, expressly

or by implication, in any commercial communication, about â[t]he existence,
67.

68.

69.

nature, or amount of fees or costs to the consumer associated with the
mortgage credit product, including but not limited to misrepresentations that
no fees are charged.â Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.3, such a misrepresentation is
specifically prohibited and is therefore material.

Go Direct violated Â§ 1014.3(c) because, as described in Paragraphs 36-39,
numerous Go Direct mortgage advertisements contained misrepresentations
about the existence, nature, or amount of fees or costs to the consumer

associated with a mortgage credit product.
Misrepresentations Using the Word âFixed,â 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.3(g)

Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.3(g), it is a violation for any person subject to the
MAP Rule to make any misrepresentation, directly or indirectly, expressly
or by implication, in any commercial communication, about â[t|he
variability of interest, payments, or other terms of the mortgage credit
product, including but not limited to misrepresentations using the word
âfixed.ââ Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.3, such a misrepresentation is specifically
prohibited and is therefore material.

Go Direct violated Â§ 1014.3(g) because, as described in Paragraphs 32-35,
numerous Go Direct mortgage advertisements contained misrepresentations
about the variability of interest, payments, or other terms of a mortgage by

using the word âfixedâ to describe a variable-rate mortgage credit product.
Misrepresentations About Government Affiliation, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.3(n)

70. Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.3(n), it is a violation for any person subject to the
MAP Rule to make any misrepresentation, directly or indirectly, expressly
or by implication, in any commercial communication, about:

the association of the mortgage credit product or any provider
of such product with any other person or program, including

but not limited to misrepresentations that:

(1) The provider is, or is affiliated with, any
governmental entity or other organization; or

(2) The product is or relates to a government benefit, or
is endorsed, sponsored by, or affiliated with any
government or other program, including but not limited
to through the use of formats, symbols, or logos that

resemble those of such entity, organization, or
program.

Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.3, such a misrepresentation is specifically
prohibited and is therefore material.

71. Go Direct violated Â§ 1014.3(n) because, as described in Paragraphs 42-44,
numerous Go Direct mortgage advertisements contained misrepresentations
that the provider of the advertised mortgage credit product was affiliated
with the government.

Misrepresentations About Consumerâs
Ability to Obtain Credit Terms, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.3(q)
72.

73.

74.

75.

70.

Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.3(q), it is a violation for any person subject to the
MAP Rule to make any misrepresentation, directly or indirectly, expressly
or by implication, in any commercial communication, about â[t|he
consumerâs ability or likelihood to obtain any mortgage credit product or
term.â Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.3, such a misrepresentation is specifically
prohibited and is therefore material.

Go Direct violated Â§ 1014.3(q) because, as described in Paragraphs 28, 30,
and 39, numerous Go Direct mortgage advertisements contained
misrepresentations about the consumerâs ability or likelihood to obtain the
advertised mortgage credit product or term.

VIOLATIONS OF THE CFPA

Under the CFPA, it is unlawful for any covered person or service provider to
engage in a deceptive act or practice in connection with any transaction with
a consumer for a consumer financial product or service, or the offering of a
consumer financial product or service. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).
An act or practice is deceptive if it involves a material misrepresentation or
omission that is likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under the
circumstances.

Information that is likely to affect a consumerâs choice of, or conduct

regarding, a product or service is material to consumers.
77.

78.

79.

80.

Deceptive Representations About Credit Terms

In numerous instances, as described in Paragraphs 23-41, Go Directâs
mortgage advertisements represented, expressly or by implication, that
specific credit terms were available or would be arranged or offered by the
creditor, including representations about specific APRs, the variable or fixed
nature of rates or payments, processing fees, or the need for appraisals, when
in fact those specific credit terms were not available or were not terms that
Go Direct was actually prepared to arrange or offer.

Go Directâs misrepresentations about the availability of the advertised credit
terms of the advertised mortgage were likely to mislead consumers acting
reasonably under the circumstances.

Go Directâs misrepresentations about the credit terms of the advertised
mortgage were material because they were likely to affect the conduct or

In numerous instances, as described in Paragraphs 42-46, Go Directâs
mortgage advertisements represented, expressly or by implication, that Go
Direct was affiliated with the government.

In fact, Go Direct was not affiliated with the government.

Go Directâs misrepresentations about government affiliation were likely to
mislead consumers acting reasonably under the circumstances.

Go Directâs misrepresentations about government affiliation were material
because they were likely to affect the conduct or decisions of consumers.
Therefore, Go Direct engaged in deceptive acts and practices in violation of
the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(a), 5536(a)(1 )(B).

Deceptive Representations About Consumersâ

Ability or Likelihood to Obtain the Advertised Mortgage or Credit Term

In numerous instances, as described in Paragraphs 28, 30, and 39-41, Go
Directâs mortgage advertisements represented, expressly or by implication,
that assets and income documentation were not required to obtain a cash-out
refinance mortgage or that the credit terms stated in the advertisements were
available to borrowers with âFICO scores as low as 500.â

In fact, assets and income documentation are required to obtain a cash-out

refinance mortgage and the credit terms stated in the advertisements

containing the phrase âFICO scores as low as 500â were not available to
borrowers with FICO scores as low as 500.

Go Directâs misrepresentations that assets and income documentation were
not required to obtain a cash-out refinance mortgage and that credit terms
stated in the advertisements were available to borrowers with âFICO scores
as low as 500â were likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under the
circumstances.

Go Directâs misrepresentations that assets and income documentation were
not required to obtain a cash-out refinance mortgage and that credit terms
stated in the advertisements were available to borrowers with âFICO scores
as low as 500â were material because they were likely to affect the conduct
or decisions of consumers.

Therefore, Go Direct engaged in deceptive acts and practices in violation of
the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).

Deceptive Representations About an Increase in Property Value

In numerous instances, as described in Paragraphs 47-51, Go Directâs
mortgage advertisements claimed Go Direct had ârecordsâ indicating that
the value of the consumerâs property had increased over the past year by a
specific percentage stated in the advertisement.

In fact, Go Direct had no such records.

2020-BCFP-0008 Document1 Filed 08/21/2020 Page 25 of 49

In many instances, Go Directâs representations regarding the percentage
increase in the value of the consumerâs property were false.

Go Directâs misrepresentations about increases in the value of the
consumerâs property, and that it had records indicating that the value had
increased, were likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under the
circumstances.

Go Directâs misrepresentations about increases in the value of the
consumerâs property, and that it had records indicating that the value had
increased, were material because they were likely to affect the conduct or
decisions of consumers.

Therefore, Go Direct engaged in deceptive acts and practices in violation of
the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).

Violations of the CFPA Based on Violations of
Regulation Z and the MAP Rule

Under the CFPA, a covered personâs violation of a Federal consumer
financial law, which includes enumerated consumer laws and rules
thereunder, violates the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5536(a)(1)(A), 5481(14).

Regulation Z and the MAP Rule are Federal consumer financial laws.
99.

Go Directâs violations of Regulation Z and the MAP Rule, described in
Paragraphs 8-73, constitute violations of Â§ 1036(a)(1)(A) of the CFPA. 12
U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(A).

civil money penalty of $150,000 to the Bureau.

the Civil Penalty Fund of the Bureau as required by Â§ 1017(d) of the CFPA,
12 U.S.C. Â§ 5497(d).

this Consent Order as a penalty paid to the government. Regardless of how
the Bureau ultimately uses those funds, Respondent may not:
a. Claim, assert, or apply for a tax deduction, tax credit, or any other tax
benefit for any civil money penalty paid under this Consent Order; or
b. Seek or accept, directly or indirectly, reimbursement or

nor may Respondent benefit by, any offset or reduction of any compensatory
monetary remedies imposed in the Related Consumer Action because of the
civil money penalty paid in this action or because of any payment that the
Bureau makes from the Civil Penalty Fund. Ifthe court in any Related

from the Civil Penalty Fund, Respondent must, within 30 days after entry of
a final order granting such offset or reduction, notify the Bureau, and pay the

In the event of any default on Respondentâs obligations to make payment
under this Consent Order, interest, computed under 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1961, as
