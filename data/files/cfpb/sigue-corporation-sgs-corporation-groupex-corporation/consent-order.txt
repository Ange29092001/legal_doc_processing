Respondents have a distribution network with over 200,000 send-and-
receive locations, offices in 18 countries, and operations in all 50 of the
United States.

Respondents describe themselves as âa leading remittance provider in the
[U.S.] to Mexico Corridorâ and focus on immigrant communities in the
United States.

Respondentsâ remittance transfers involve transmitting funds and constitute
payment services. These services are offered to consumers primarily for
personal, family, or household purposes. The services are therefore
âconsumer financial product[s] or service[s]â under the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§
5481(6), (15)(A)(iv), (15)(A)(vii).

Respondents are also remittance-transfer providers under EFT A and
Regulation E because they provide remittance transfers for consumers in the
normal course of their businesses. 15 U.S.C. Â§ 16930-1(g)(3); 12 C.F.R. Â§
1005.30(f).

In 2010, EFT A was amended by adding Â§ 919 to create a comprehensive
system of consumer protections for remittance transfers sent by U.S.
consumers to individuals and businesses in foreign countries. Section 919
includes a number of requirements related to remittance transfers, including

that:

e remittance-transfer providers must disclose the exchange rate, the
amount to be received, and other information both before and at
the time the consumer pays for the transfer, 15 U.S.C. Â§ 16930-

I(a)(1) & (2);

e consumers have certain rights regarding cancellation and refunds,
15 U.S.C. Â§ 16930-1(d);

e remittance-transfer providers must investigate disputes and remedy
errors regarding remittances, 15 U.S.C. Â§ 16930-1(d); and

e remittance-transfer providers are liable for certain acts of their
agents, 15 U.S.C. Â§ 16300-1(f).

The Bureau issued rules to implement these requirements, which became
effective on October 28, 2013. These rules are known as the Remittance
Rule.

Respondents provide remittance transfers to consumers using their retail
branches and a network of agents across the United States, including
convenience stores, supermarkets, and other retail establishments where they
have installed a dedicated computer or a telephone that can be used to send
remittance transfers using Respondentsâ services.

As of October 28, 2013, the effective date of the Remittance Rule,
Respondents have been subject to the requirements of EFT A and the
Remittance Rule.

Respondents were aware of the Remittance Rule and made operational
changes after the Rule became effective but did not fully comply with some

of the disclosure and error-resolution requirements.

From 2013 until at least 2019, Respondents engaged in the acts and practices
in providing remittance transfers as described below.

Respondents violated Â§Â§ 1005.33(c)(1) and (c)(2) (ii) (B)
by failing to notify some consumers of the remedies available for

correcting errors and providing those consumers with the appropriate remedy.

17.

18.

19.

Section 1005.33(c)(1) of the Remittance Rule requires remittance-transfer
providers to investigate promptly a notice of error received from a sender
and to determine whether an error occurred within 90 days of receiving
notice. Section 1005.33(c)(1) further requires remittance-transfer providers
to âreport the results to the sender, including notice of any remedies
available for correcting any error that the provider determines has occurred,
within three business days after completing its investigation.â

Among other things, it is generally an error if a remittance-transfer provider
fails to make funds available to a designated recipient by the date of
availability stated in the receipt or combined disclosure that the provider
provides to a sender under Â§ 1005.33(a)(1)(iv).

Section 1005.33(c)(2)(11)(B) of the Remittance Rule requires a remittance-
transfer provider to refund fees imposed on a remittance transfer to a sender
following an assertion of an error when the provider commits an error under
Â§ 1005.33(a)(1 )(iv) by failing to make funds available to the designated

recipient by the date of availability in the receipt or combined disclosure.

When Respondents committed errors under Â§ 1005.33(a)(1 \1v), they
refunded fees only to senders who, as a remedy, requested that Respondents
cancel the transaction. Respondents did not refund fees to senders who, as a
remedy, requested that Respondents resend the transaction.

Between 2015 and 2019, for senders who requested that Respondents resend
the remittance transfer as a remedy, Respondents did not adequately notify
those consumers of the available remedies or refund fees imposed on the
remittance transfer in a total of more than 9,280 instances and resulting in a
total cost to consumers of approximately $99,944.95.

Respondents therefore violated 12 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1005.33(c)(1) and (c)(2)(11)(B).

Respondents violated Â§Â§ 1005.33(c)(1) and (d)(1)
by failing to properly report the results of error investigations

and failing to notify consumers of their rights after error investigations.

Section 1005.33(c)(1) of the Remittance Rule requires remittance-transfer
providers to investigate promptly a notice of error from a sender and to
determine whether an error occurred within 90 days of receiving notice.
Section 1005.33(c)(1) further requires remittance-transfer providers to
âreport the results to the sender, including notice of any remedies available
for correcting any error that the provider determines has occurred, within

three business days after completing its investigation.â

Section 1005.33(d)(1) of the Remittance Rule requires a remittance-transfer
provider to follow certain procedures if it determines that no error occurred
or if a different error occurred than the error identified in the senderâs notice
of error. Specifically, this section requires the remittance-transfer provider to
give the sender a written explanation of the providerâs findings regarding the
notice of error and to note the senderâs right to request the documents on
which the remittance-transfer provider relied in making its determination.
From the effective date of the Remittance Rule through at least 2019, it was
Respondentsâ practice to inform consumers about complaint-investigation
results only by telephone, even if Respondents found no error or a different
error from the one alleged.

Respondents therefore violated 12 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1005.33(c)(1) and (d)(1).

Respondents violated Â§ 1005. 33(g)(1) by failing to develop
and maintain written policies and procedures designed to ensure

compliance with certain error-resolution requirements of the Remittance Rule.

28.

Section 1005.33(g)(1) of the Remittance Rule requires remittance-transfer
providers to develop and maintain written policies and procedures that are
designed to ensure compliance with the Ruleâs error-resolution
requirements.

From the effective date of the Remittance Rule to at least 2019,

Respondents had no written policies and procedures on the

appropriate remedies for correcting âerrors.â Respondents did not

fully comply with the Ruleâs procedures for resolving errors.

From December 2017 to at least September 2018, Respondentsâ written
policies and procedures inaccurately stated that investigation results could be
reported either orally or in writing to a consumer even in cases where the
Remittance Rule requires the provider to explain its findings in writing.
During this period, Respondents followed their written policies and
procedures, rather than the Remittance Ruleâs requirements, and so did not
provide investigation results in writing where the Rule requires written
notice.

From September 2014 to November 2017, Respondents described âerrorsâ
too narrowly in their written policies and procedures, making it likely that
following such policies and procedures would result in undercompliance
with the Rule.

Thus, between the effective date of the Remittance Rule and 2019,
Respondentsâ policies and procedures were not adequately designed to
ensure compliance with Â§Â§ 1005.33(c)(1), (c)(2), or (d)(1).

Respondents therefore violated 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1005.33(g)(1).

Sigue Corp. violated Â§Â§ 1005.31(b)(1) (i)-(iii), (v)-(vii), and (b)(2) (i)

by failing to identify the amounts, fees, and taxes associated with certain

transfers as required by the Remittance Rule.

Section 1005.31 of the Remittance Rule generally requires remittance-
transfer providers to give consumers certain disclosures. If providers choose
to provide those disclosures through prepayment disclosures and receipts, as
Respondents have since the Ruleâs effective date, Â§ 1005.31(b) governs the
content of those prepayment disclosures and receipts.

Sections 1005.3 1(b)(1)() and (b)(2)(1) require that prepayment disclosures
and receipts disclose the amount that will be transferred to the designated
recipient, in the currency in which the remittance transfer is funded, using
the term âtransfer amountâ ora substantially similar term.

Sections 1005.3 1(b)(1 (i) and (b)(2)(4) require that prepayment disclosures
and receipts disclose any fees imposed and any taxes collected on the
remittance transfer by the provider, in the currency in which the remittance
transfer is funded, using the terms âtransfer feesâ for fees and âtransfer
taxesâ for taxes, or substantially similar terms.

Sections 1005.3 1(b)(1)(il) and (b)(2)(1) require that prepayment disclosures
and receipts disclose the total amount of the transaction, in the currency in
which the remittance transfer is funded, using the term âtotalâ ora

substantially similar term.

Sections 1005.3 1(b)(1)(v) and (b)(2)(1) require that prepayment disclosures
and receipts disclose the amount that will be transferred to the designated
recipient, in the currency in which the funds will be received by the
designated recipient, but only if certain covered third-party fees are imposed,
using the term âtransfer amountâ or a substantially similar term.

Sections 1005.3 1(b)(1 (vi) and (b)(2)(4) require that prepayment disclosures
and receipts disclose any covered third-party fees, in the currency in which
the funds will be received by the designated recipient, using the term âother
feesâ or a substantially similar term.

Sections 1005.3 1(b)(1 (vit) and (b)(2)(1) require that prepayment disclosures
and receipts disclose the amount that will be received by the designated
recipient, in the currency in which the funds will be received, using the term
âtotal to recipientâ or a substantially similar term.

Between 2013 and 2019, some of Sigue Corp.âs prepayment disclosures and
receipts did not specify the currency of the various amounts, fees, and taxes
in amanner required by the Remittance Rule.

Sigue Corp. therefore violated 12 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1005.31(b)(1)(@)-(i), (v)-(vii),

and (b)(2)(1).

that did not use the term âtransfer amountâ or a substantially similar term.

Sections 1005.3 1(b)(1)() and (b)(2)(1) of the Remittance Rule require that
prepayment disclosures and receipts disclose the amount that will be
transferred to the designated recipient, in the currency in which the
remittance transfer is funded, using the term âtransfer amountâ ora
substantially similar term.

Between 2013 and at least 2019, Sigue Corp. issued prepayment disclosures
and receipts that used the Spanish phrase âcantidad netaâ and the English
translation ânet before exchangeâ to indicate the amount to be transferred to
the designated recipient. The English phrase ânet before exchangeâ is not
substantially similar to âtransfer amount.â

Sigue Corp. therefore violated 12 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1005.31(b)(1)() and (b)(2)(i).

Sigue Corp. and GroupEx violated Â§ 1005.31(b)(2)(vi) by issuing

some receipts that did not identify state-licensing and -chartering agencies.

Section 1005.31(b)(2)(vi) of the Remittance Rule requires that remittance-
transfer receipts contain a statement that âthe sender can contact the State
agency that licenses or charters the remittance transfer provider. . . for
questions or complaintsâ and provide the relevant state agencyâs name,

telephone numbers, and website.

From at least 2018 to 2019, some Sigue Corp. receipts contained inaccurate

including omitting the relevant agencyâs name, telephone numbers, or

In at least 2019, some GroupEx receipts contained inaccurate information
about the state-licensing or -chartering agencies for Georgia, Maryland,
North Carolina, and Oregon, including omitting the relevant agencyâs name,
telephone numbers, or websites.

Sigue Corp. and GroupEx therefore violated 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1005.31(b)(2)(vi).

Respondents violated Â§ 1005.31(c)(1) by issuing prepayment disclosures
that did not comply with the Remittance Ruleâs grouping requirement.

Section 1005.31(c)(1) of the Remittance Rule requires that the following

types of information (or their equivalents) be grouped together on

99 66 99 66

prepayment disclosures: âtransfer amount,â âtransfer fees,â âtransfer taxes,â

(or their equivalents) be grouped together when applicable: âtransfer

From the Ruleâs effective date through at least 2019, some of Respondentsâ

Respondents therefore violated 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1005.31(c)(1).

Sigue Corp. violated Â§Â§ 1005. 31(b)(1) (viii) and (b)(2) i)
by including a statement on certain prepayment disclosures and

receipts that non-covered, third-party fees may apply to a remittance transfer.

52.

53.

Sections 1005.3 1(b)(1 (vim) and (b)(2)(4) of the Remittance Rule require a
remittance-transfer provider to disclose to a sender, as applicable, a
statement indicating that non-covered, third-party fees or taxes collected on
the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider may apply to the
remittance transfer and result in the designated recipient receiving less than
the amount disclosed pursuant to Â§ 1005.31(b)(1)(vu). A provider may
include this disclosure only if such fees or taxes do or may apply to the
transfer.

From the Ruleâs effective date through at least 2019, some of Sigue Corp.âs
prepayment disclosures and receipts stated that a designated ârecipient may
receive less due to taxes and additional non-covered third-party fees charged
within destination country,â or included substantially similar statements,
when non-covered, third-party fees could not be imposed on the remittance

transfer.

Under Â§ 1055(c) of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5565(c), by reason of the
violations of law described in Â§ IV of this Consent Order, and taking into
account the factors in 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5565(c)(3), Respondents must pay a civil
money penalty of $300,000 to the Bureau.
Within 10 days of the Effective Date, Respondents must pay the civil money
penalty by wire transfer to the Bureau or to the Bureauâs agent in
compliance with the Bureauâs wiring instructions.

the Civil Penalty Fund of the Bureau as required by Â§ 1017(d) ofthe CFPA,
12 U.S.C. Â§ 5497(d).

benefit for any civil money penalty paid under this Consent Order; or

b. seek or accept, directly or indirectly, remmbursement or
indemnification from any source, including but not limited to payment
made under any insurance policy, with regard to any civil money

penalty paid under this Consent Order.

To preserve the deterrent effect of the civil money penalty in any Related
Consumer Action, Respondents may not argue that Respondents are entitled
to, nor may Respondents benefit by, any offset or reduction of any
compensatory monetary remedies imposed in the Related Consumer Action
because of the civil money penalty paid in this action or because of any
payment that the Bureau makes from the Civil Penalty Fund. Ifthe court in
any Related Consumer Action offsets or otherwise reduces the amount of
compensatory monetary remedies imposed against Respondents based on the
civil money penalty paid in this action or based on any payment that the
Bureau makes from the Civil Penalty Fund, Respondents must, within 30
days after entry of a final order granting such offset or reduction, notify the
Bureau, and pay the amount of the offset or reduction to the U.S. Treasury.

Such a payment will not be considered an additional civil money penalty and
