Commonwealth of Massachusetts ex rel. Maura Healey, Attorney
General (the Commonwealth), bring this action against Commonwealth
Equity Group, LLC (d/b/a Key Credit Repair) (KCR) and Nikitas

that violate Â§Â§ 1031 and 1036 of the Consumer Financial Protection Act
of 2010 (CFPA), 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531, 5536, and Â§ 2 of the Massachusetts

Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act, 15
U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6101-6108, and the Telemarketing Sales Rule (TSR), 16
C.F.R. Â§Â§ 310.3 & 310.4; and (3) various acts or practices that violate
the Massachusetts Credit Services Organization Law, M.G.L. c. 93,
Â§Â§ 68A-E (MA-CSO). The Bureau and the Commonwealth allege as
follows.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

1. This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this action
because it concerns federal consumer-financial law, 12 U.S.C.

Â§ 5565(a)(1), presents a federal question, 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1331, and is
brought by an agency of the United States, 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1345.

2. This Court has supplemental jurisdiction over the
Commonwealthâs state-law claims because they are so related to the
federal claims that they form part of the same case or controversy. 28
U.S.C. Â§ 1367(a).

3. Venue is proper in this district because Defendants are

located, reside, or do business in this district and because a substantial
Case 1:20-cv-10991 Documenti1 Filed 05/22/20 Page 3 of 27

part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claims occurred in this
district. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5564(f); 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1391(b).
PARTIES

4. The Bureau is an independent agency of the United States.
12 U.S.C. Â§ 5491. The Bureau is charged with enforcing âFederal
consumer financial laws.â 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5563 and 5564. The Bureau has
independent litigating authority, 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5564(a)-(b), including the
authority to enforce the TSR with respect to the offering or provision of
a consumer-financial product or service under the CFPA, 15 U.S.C.

Â§ 6105(d).

5. Maura Healey is the Attorney General of Massachusetts and
its chief legal officer. Attorney General Healey is charged with, among
other things, enforcing the MA-UDAP and other consumer-protection
laws in the public interest. Indeed, the MA-UDAP created a statutory
mandate for the Attorney General to investigate and prosecute any
entity or person who âis using or is about to use any method, act, or
practice declared by section two [of the MA-UDAP] to be unlawful.â
M.G.L. c. 93A, Â§Â§ 4, 6. Those actions âdeclared .. . to be unlawful by

section twoâ of the MA-UDAP include âunfair methods of competition
Case 1:20-cv-10991 Document1 Filed 05/22/20 Page 4 of 27

and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or
commerce,â M.G.L. c 938A, Â§Â§ 2, 4, while violations of Â§Â§ 68B to 68E of
the MA-CSO automatically constitute violations of the MA-UDAP.

6. KCRisa lmited-liability company incorporated in
Massachusetts in 2007. Its principal place of business is located at 686
Morton Street, Suite #2, Boston, Massachusetts. Through telemarketing
and tele-sales, KCR offers and purports to provide credit-repair or
credit-improvement services to consumers nationwide.

7. KCRisa âcovered personâ under 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(6)(A)
because it offers or provides a consumer-financial product or service for
use by consumers primarily for personal, family, or household purposes
or that is delivered, offered, or provided in connection with such a
product or service. The services offered or provided consist of financial-
advisory services, including credit counseling and âcollecting, analyzing,

consumers, used or expected to be used in connection with any decision
regarding the offering or provision of a consumer financial product or

service.â 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(15)(A)(v1ii), (1x).
Case 1:20-cv-10991 Documenti1 Filed 05/22/20 Page 5 of 27

8.  Nikitas Tsoukales, sometimes known as Nikitas Tsoukalis,
is KCRâs president and sole owner. Tsoukales has managerial
responsibility for KCR and arranges for KCR to provide credit-repair or
credit-improvement services, including by directing KCRâs day-to-day
operations, finances, marketing, and sales practices.

9.  Tsoukales is a âcovered personâ under 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(6)(A)
because he offers or provides a consumer-financial product or service for
use by consumers primarily for personal, family, or household purposes,
or that is delivered, offered, or provided in connection with such a
product or service. The services offered or provided consist of financial-
advisory services, including credit counseling and âcollecting, analyzing,
maintaining, or providing consumer report information or other account
information, including information relating to the credit history of
consumers, used or expected to be used in connection with any decision
regarding the offering or provision of a consumer financial product or
service.â 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(15)(A)(v1ii), (1x).

10. Tsoukales is also a ârelated personâ under 12 U.S.C.

Â§ 5481(25) because he has managerial responsibility for KCR, and he

materially participates in the conduct of KCRâs affairs. As a related
Case 1:20-cv-10991 Document1 Filed 05/22/20 Page 6 of 27

person, Tsoukales is deemed a covered person under the CFPA. 12
U.S.C. Â§ 5481(25).

11. Defendants are âsellersâ under the TSR as that term is
defined by 16 C.F.R. Â§ 310.2(dd) because, in connection with
telemarketing transactions, they provide, offer to provide, or arrange for
others to provide goods or services to customers in exchange for
consideration.

12. KCRisa âtelemarketerâ under the TSR as that term is
defined by 16 C.F.R. Â§ 310.2(ff) because, in connection with
telemarketing, it initiates or receives telephone calls to or from
customers.

13. Tsoukales and KCR are each a âcredit services organizationâ
(CSO) under the MA-CSO because each is a person or entity that âsells,
provides, performs, or who represents to sell, provide or perform for the
payment of money or other valuable considerationâ one or more of three
types of services, which include âimproving a buyerâs credit record,
history or ratingâ and âproviding advice or assistanceâ in support

thereof. M.G.L. c. 93, Â§ 68A.
Case 1:20-cv-10991 Document1 Filed 05/22/20 Page 7 of 27

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

14. Tsoukales and KCR market and sell credit-repair services to
consumers nationwide.

15. KCR markets itself as providing services that will assist
consumers in removing derogatory information from, or improving, the
consumers credit history, credit record, or credit scores or ratings.

16. KCR conducts telemarketing through receiving inbound
phone calls from consumers.

17. Tsoukales created the scripts that KCRâs telemarketers use
in the sale of KCRâs services, is responsible for the content of KCRâs
websites, and oversees nearly all aspects of KCRâs marketing and
advertising.

18. Tsoukales also interacts directly with consumers and KCRâs
customers, and he has made representations to consumers related to
KCRâs credit-repair services before, during, and after their enrollment
with the company.

19. Since 2008, KCR has enrolled tens of thousands of
consumers. From 2016 through 2019, KCR enrolled nearly 40,000

consumers nationwide.
Case 1:20-cv-10991 Document1 Filed 05/22/20 Page 8 of 27

20. Since January 2011, KCR has collected at least $23,000,000
in fees from consumers.

21. Since January 2011, KCR has enrolled roughly 12,616
Massachusetts consumers.

22. KCR requires that consumers pay what it calls a âfirst work
feeâ of between $99.95 and $159.95 or more within five days of enrolling
with the company.

23. KCR then charges consumers monthly fees of $99.95 to
$159.95 or more, depending on the service level the consumer chooses.
KCR also adds an âexpedited billing processing feeâ of at least $6.50 to
the monthly fees.

24. KCR collects these fees from consumers before achieving the
promised credit-repair results.

25. As CSOs, Defendants are prohibited from charging any
advance feesânamely, any fee charged before âfull, complete and
satisfactory performanceâ of the credit-repair services offeredâunless
two conditions are met. M.G.L. c. 93, Â§ 68B. First, the CSO must obtain
a surety bond in the amount of at least $10,000 issued by a company

authorized to do business in Massachusetts. M.G.L. c. 93, Â§ 68B(1).
Case 1:20-cv-10991 Document1 Filed 05/22/20 Page 9 of 27

Second, the CSO must establish a trust account at a âfederally insured
bank or savings and loan association located in [Massachusetts].â Jd.

26. While Defendants appear to maintain a $10,000 surety bond
written by Western Surety Company, they do not have a trust account
of any kind.

27. Since at least 2017, KCR has made representations about its
credit-repair services on its website, in online advertising, and in its
customer agreements.

28. For example, as of early March 2020, KCRâs website
included the following representations:

a. âour team of more than 60 credit experts help[s] each
and every client individuallyâ to âtake the next steps towards
credit freedom;â and

b.  âfo]ur consultations are all done by our owner, Nik
Tsoukales, and his team of certified credit consultants.â

29. KCR, however, has just a handful of Boston-based
employees, only some of whom interact directly with consumers. The
majority of KCRâs sales and client interactions are conducted by

contract telemarketers located in Central America who are
Case 1:20-cv-10991 Document1 Filed 05/22/20 Page 10 of 27

compensated almost entirely by commission, based on the number of
clients they enroll in KCRâs programs.

30. In addition, in December 2018, KCRâs website included the

following representations:

31. In many instances, however, KCR did not fix unlimited
amounts of negative items on clientsâ credit files. And most clients did

not see credit scores with an âaverage 90 point increase in 90 days.â

10
Case 1:20-cv-10991 Document1 Filed 05/22/20 Page 11 of 27

32. Another KCR advertisement published online in September

2018 stated:

 

Clients start seeing
removals in as little as
A5 days.

 

 

 

33. In many instances, however, consumers did not see removals
on their credit reports within 45 days of enrolling with KCR.
34. Other advertisements published on KCRâs website from at
least January 2018 to at least March 2019 represented that KCR
would assist consumers in removing derogatory information from, or
improving, the consumersâ credit record, including:
a. âWe dramatically increase credit scores to help

consumers that are struggling to get approved;â

11
Case 1:20-cv-10991 Document1 Filed 05/22/20 Page 12 of 27

b. âWe help people whose low credit scores are holding
them back from the life they want;â and
C. âClean Up Unlimited Negative Records.â

35. In many instances, however, KCR did not dramatically
increase consumers credit scores and did not clean up unlimited
negative records on behalf of consumers.

36. KCRâs representations have led consumers to believe that if
they paid for KCRâs services, the company would help improve their
credit scores or remove derogatory information from their credit reports.

37. In many instances, however, KCR failed to deliver the
promised results, and consumers did not see their credit scores

improved or negative items removed from their credit reports.

COUNT I
Abusive Telemarketing Acts or Practices That Violate the TSR

38. The allegations in paragraphs 1 to 37 are incorporated here
by reference.

39. Itis an abusive telemarketing act or practice and a violation
of the TSR for any seller or telemarketer to request or receive payment

of any fee or consideration for goods or services represented to remove

12
Case 1:20-cv-10991 Document1 Filed 05/22/20 Page 13 of 27

derogatory information from, or improve, a personâs credit history,
credit record, or credit rating, until:
a. the timeframe in which the seller has represented that
all of the goods or services will be provided to that person
has expired; and
b. the seller has provided the person with documentation
in the form of a consumer report from a consumer-reporting
agency demonstrating that the promised results have been
achieved, such report having been issued more than six
months after the results were achieved. 16 C.F.R.
Â§ 310.4(a)(2).
40. Defendants have made representations to consumers that
their credit-repair services would remove derogatory information from,
or improve, the consumersâ credit histories, credit reports, or credit

ratings.

13
Case 1:20-cv-10991 Document1 Filed 05/22/20 Page 14 of 27

41. Defendants routinely requested and received payment of a
fee or consideration for their credit-repair services before:
a. the timeframe in which they represented that all of
their goods or services would be provided to the consumer
expired; and
b. they provided the consumer with documentation in the
form of a consumer report from a consumer-reporting agency
demonstrating that the promised results were achieved, such
report having been issued more than six months after the
results were achieved.
42. Therefore, Defendants have engaged in abusive
telemarketing acts or practices that violated 16 C.F.R. Â§ 310.4(a)(2).

COUNT II
Deceptive Telemarketing Acts or Practices That Violate the TSR

43. The allegations in paragraphs 1 to 37 are incorporated here
by reference.

44. Itisa deceptive telemarketing act or practice under the TSR
for a seller or telemarketer to misrepresent any material aspect of the

performance, efficacy, nature, or central characteristics of its services.

16 C.F.R. Â§ 310.3(a)(2)(ii).

14
Case 1:20-cv-10991 Document1 Filed 05/22/20 Page 15 of 27

45. In numerous instances, in connection with the offering or
provision of credit-repair services, Defendants have represented,
directly or indirectly, expressly or by implication, that KCRâs actions
would or likely would result in a substantial increase to consumersâ
credit scores.

46. But, in numerous instances, KCRs actions did not result in a
substantial increase to consumersâ credit scores.

47. In numerous instances, in connection with the offering or
provision of credit-repair services, Defendants have represented,
directly or indirectly, expressly or by implication, that KCRâs actions
would or likely would result in the removal of negative entries on
consumers credit reports.

48. But, in numerous instances, KCRs actions did not result in
the removal of negative entries on consumersâ credit reports.

49. These representations have been material and likely to
mislead consumers acting reasonably under the circumstances.

50. Because Defendants are sellers or telemarketers under the

TSR, these misrepresentations about the performance, efficacy, nature,

15
Case 1:20-cv-10991 Document1 Filed 05/22/20 Page 16 of 27

or central characteristics of KCRâs services violated the TSR. 16 C.F.R.
Â§ 310.3(a)(2)(iu1).

COUNT III
TSR Violations Constitute Violations of the CFPA

51. The allegations in paragraphs | to 37 are incorporated here
by reference.

52. Under the CFPA, it is unlawful for any covered person or
service provider to commit any act or omission in violation of a âFederal
consumer financial law.â 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(A).

53. Any violation of the TSR that is committed by a person
subject to the CFPA shall be treated as a violation of a rule under
Â§ 1031 of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5531, regarding unfair, deceptive, or
abusive acts or practices. 15 U.S.C. Â§ 6102(c)(2).

54. Therefore, any violation of the TSR by a covered person is
also a violation of the CFPA.

55. Because Defendants are covered persons and have

committed an act or omission in violation of the TSR, they also violated

the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(A).

16
Case 1:20-cv-10991 Document1 Filed 05/22/20 Page 17 of 27

COUNT IV
Deceptive Acts or Practices That Violate the CFPA

56. The allegations in paragraphs 1 to 37 are incorporated here
by reference.

57. In numerous instances, in connection with the offering or
provision of credit-repair services, Defendants have directly or
indirectly, expressly or by implication, made material
misrepresentations regarding the efficacy of KCRâs credit-repair
services by representing that KCRâs actions would or likely would result
in a substantial increase to consumersâ credit scores.

58. But, in numerous instances, KCRâs actions did not result in
a substantial increase to consumersâ credit scores.

59. In numerous instances, in connection with the offering or
provision of credit-repair services, Defendants have directly or
indirectly, expressly or by implication, made material
misrepresentations regarding the efficacy of KCRâs credit-repair
services by representing that KCRâs actions would or likely would result
in the removal of material negative entries on consumersâ credit reports.

60. But in numerous instances, KCRâs actions did not result in

the removal of negative entries on consumersâ credit reports.

17
Case 1:20-cv-10991 Document1 Filed 05/22/20 Page 18 of 27

61. These representations regarding KCRâs services were
material and likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under the
circumstances.

62. Therefore, Defendantsâ representations as described herein
were false and misleading and constituted deceptive acts or practices in
violation of Â§Â§ 1031 and 1036 of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531, 5536.

COUNT V
TSR and CFPA Violations
Constitute Violations of the MA-UDAP

63. The allegations in paragraphs 1 to 37 are incorporated here
by reference.

64. Under the MA-UDAP, violations of federal consumer-
protection laws such as the TSR and CFPA constitute violations of Â§ 2 of
the MA-UDAP, which prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices in
the conduct of business in Massachusetts. 940 CMR 3.16; M.G.L. c. 93A,
Â§ 2.

65. Therefore, any violation of the TSR or CFPA by a person or

entity that conducts business in Massachusetts is also a violation of the

MA-UDAP.

18
Case 1:20-cv-10991 Document1 Filed 05/22/20 Page 19 of 27

66. Because Defendants committed acts or omissions that
violated the TSR and CFPA, they also violated the MA-UDAPâs ban on
unfair or deceptive acts or practices.

COUNT VI
Defendants Operate in Open
Violation of Numerous Requirements of the MA-CSO

67. The allegations in paragraphs 1 to 37 are incorporated here
by reference.

68. As CSOs, in order to charge any advance fees, Defendants
are required to maintain a $10,000 surety bond written by a company
authorized to do business in Massachusetts and establish and maintain
a trust account with a Massachusetts bank or savings and loan
institution. M.G.L. c. 93, Â§ 68B(1). Defendants have not met these
requirements, yet they continually charge monthly service and other
fees to consumers before fully and completely performing the promised
credit-repair services, in violation of the MA-CSO.

69. In addition, before execution of a contract and before the
receipt of money or valuable consideration from a consumer, CSOs must

disclose in writing âa complete and detailed description of the services

to be performed by the [CSO] and the total cost to the buyer for such

19
Case 1:20-cv-10991 Document1 Filed 05/22/20 Page 20 of 27

services.â M.G.L. c. 93, Â§ 68C(5). And every CSO service agreement or
contract must set forth âthe terms and conditions of payment, including
the total of all payments to be made by the buyer, whether to the [CSO]
or to some other person.â M.G.L. c. 93, Â§ 68D(c) (emphasis added).

70. Finally, before execution of a contract and before the receipt
of money or valuable consideration from a consumer, CSOs are required
to provide consumers with a written statement âasserting the buyerâs
right to proceed against the surety bond or trust account required under
[Â§ 68B of the MA-CSO]â along with the name and business address of
any such surety company and trust-account depository, together with
the name of the trustee and the account number. M.G.L. c. 93, Â§ 68C(6)-
(7).

71. Defendantsâ credit-service agreement (CSA)âtheir written
contract with consumersâdoes not set forth the âtotal cost to the buyerâ
or âthe total of all payments to be made by the buyer.â Instead, KCRâs
CSAs are open-ended, highlighting that âthe client understands that
they are paying on a month to month basis.â The CSA discloses only the
first-work fee, to be paid within five days, and the monthly service fee

plus âexpedited billing processing fee,â both of which are to be charged

20
Case 1:20-cv-10991 Document1 Filed 05/22/20 Page 21 of 27

âeach subsequent monthâ after the first-work fee. These charges
continue indefinitely until the consumer cancels the agreement in
writing.

72. Defendantsâ CSA also fails to alert the consumer to his or
her right to proceed against the relevant surety bond or trust account
and fails to disclose the contact and other information for those entities,
as required by the MA-CSO.

73. By failing to establish the required trust account and failing
to disclose in writing the various required elements, as detailed above,
Defendants violated Â§Â§ 68B(1), 68C(5)-(7) and 68D(c) of the MA-CSO.
See M.G.L. c. 93, Â§Â§ 68A-E.

COUNT VII
Untrue or Misleading Representations and Acts Intended
to Defraud or Deceive Buyers in Violation of the MA-CSO

74. The allegations in paragraphs 1 to 37 are incorporated here
by reference.

75. The MA-CSO prohibits CSOs from making or using any

âuntrue or misleading representations in the offer or sale of [credit

services] or from engag[ing], directly or indirectly, in any act, practice or

21
Case 1:20-cv-10991 Document1 Filed 05/22/20 Page 22 of 27

course of business intended to defraud or deceive a buyer in connection
with the offer or sale of such services.â M.G.L. c. 93, Â§ 68B(4).

76. In numerous instances, in connection with the offering or
provision of credit-repair services, Defendants have directly or
indirectly, expressly or by implication, made material
misrepresentations regarding the efficacy of KCRâs credit-repair
services by representing that KCRâs actions would or likely would result
in a substantial increase to consumersâ credit scores, often within a
specified period.

77. But, in numerous instances, KCRâs actions did not result in
a substantial increase, or any increase, to consumersâ credit scores, and
any increase often occurred outside the promised timeframe.

78. In numerous instances, in connection with the offering or
provision of credit-repair services, Defendants have directly or
indirectly, expressly or by implication, made material
misrepresentations regarding the efficacy of KCRâs credit-repair
services by representing that KCRâs actions would or likely would result
in the removal of material negative entries on consumersâ credit reports,

often within a specified period.

22
Case 1:20-cv-10991 Document1 Filed 05/22/20 Page 23 of 27

79. But, in numerous instances, KCRâs actions did not result in
the removal of negative entries on consumersâ credit reports, and to the
extent that some portion of such negative entries were removed, this
often occurred outside the promised timeframe.

80. These representations regarding KCRâs services were
material and likely to deceive or mislead consumers acting reasonably
under the circumstances.

81. Therefore, Defendantsâ representations as described herein
were âuntrue or misleadingâ or âintended to defraud or deceiveâ
consumers in violation of Â§ 68B(4) of M.G.L. c. 93.

COUNT VIII
Defendantsâ CSO Violations
Constitute Violations of the MA-UDAP

82. The allegations in paragraphs 1 to 37 are incorporated here
by reference.

83. A violation of any section of the MA-CSO relating to the
conduct of credit-services organizations in Massachusetts (1.e., Â§Â§ 68B to

68D of M.G.L. c. 93) âshall [also] constitute a violation ofâ the MA-

UDAP.

23
Case 1:20-cv-10991 Document1 Filed 05/22/20 Page 24 of 27

84. Because Defendants violated the MA-CSO, as detailed in
Counts VI and VII, they also violated the MA-UDAPâs ban on unfair or

deceptive acts or practices.

COUNT IX
Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices That Violate the MA-UDAP

85. The allegations in paragraphs 1 to 37 are incorporated here
by reference.

86. In numerous instances, in connection with the offering or
provision of credit-repair services, Defendants have directly or
indirectly, expressly or by implication, made material
