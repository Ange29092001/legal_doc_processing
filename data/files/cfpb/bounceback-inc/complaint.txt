3. This Court has personal jurisdiction over Bounce Back because the causes
of action arise from BounceBackâs conduct in this district.

A. Venue is proper in this district because BounceBack is located, resides,

FACTS
Overview

8. BounceBack, Inc., is a privatelyowned company based in Kansas City, Missouri. It
operates back-check pretrial-diversion programs on behalf of more than 90 district
attorneys (DAs) throughout the United States. BounceBackâs pretrial-diversion program
generally operates as follows.

9. Merchants primarily submit dishonored checks to Bounce Back through its

affiliate, Check Connection, Inc.

2
Case 5:20-cv-06179-BP Document1 Filed 12/09/20 Page 2 of 15
10. | Aftera merchant reports a dishonored check to Check Connection, Check
Connection adds it to a list of dishonored checks by jurisdiction and sends it to the
pertinent DA for review.

11. In nearly all cases, without receiving further direction from the DA,
BounceBack then attempts to enroll the check writers in its pre-trial diversion program,
which requires a check writer to pay the debt and also enroll in, pay for, and complete a
financial-education course.

12. | Onrare occasions, merchants send the names of check writers directly to
the local DA, who then forwards to BounceBack the names of specific check writers who
it wants enrolled in the pretrial-diversion program. In most cases, however, Check
Connection generates a list of check writers that it sends to BounceBack, which enrolls
those check writers in its collections program without ever receiving direction from the
DA to do so.

13. BounceBack then sends two to four letters, on DA letterhead, to the check
writers in an effort to collect the outstanding debts and enroll them in the financial-
education course.

14. The letters tell check writers that they could face criminal prosecution and
conviction, but that they can avoid prosecution by paying the amount of the dishonored
check, along with certain administrative fees, and completing a financial-education
course. The recipient is instructed to pay the total fees owed to the âCheck Enforcement
Programâ (in reality BounceBack), including a fee for the financial-education course that
ranges from $100 to $165. If the check writer pays these amounts, then BounceBack
sends the amount of the dishonored check to the merchant, pays small fees to the
merchant and the DA, and keeps the balance.

3
Case 5:20-cv-06179-BP Document1 Filed 12/09/20 Page 3 of 15
15. | BounceBack does not identify itself to check writers and does not inform
them that it is a debt collector.

16. Although BounceBackâs letters appear to come directly from the DA and
suggest that check writers will face criminal charges if they do not comply, DAs almost
never prosecute such cases.

17. | Moreover, nearly all jurisdictions have given BounceBack one set of
criteria for sending warning letters to check writers and enrolling them in a financial-
education course, and a separate, more stringent set of criteria for referring a case back
to the DA for potential prosecution when a check writer fails to respond to a letter.
Given these distinct criteria, not all check writers who receive BounceBackâs warning
letters are even eligible for prosecution under the DAsâ prosecution criteria.

18. |Inmost cases, BounceBack does not refer cases for prosecution, evenif the
check writer fails to respond to the letter, does not pay the alleged outstanding debt and
fees, or fails to complete the financial-education course.

19. | BounceBack has sent collection letters to more than 19,000 consumers
since January 1, 2015.

BounceBack is a Debt Collector Under the FDCPA

20. BounceBack is a debt collector under the FDCPA.

21. Under 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1692a(6), a debt collector is âany person who uses any
instrument or instrumentality of interstate commerce or the mails in any business the
principal purpose of which is the collection of any debts, or who regularly collects or
attempts to collect directly or indirectly, debts owed or due or asserted to be owed or

due another.â

4
Case 5:20-cv-06179-BP Document1 Filed 12/09/20 Page 4 of 15
22. The FDCPA provides that an entity operating a bad-check diversion
program through a contract with a DA may not be considered a debt collector if the
entity complies with certain statutory requirements. BounceBack did not comply with
those requirements.

23. Inmostcases, BounceBack contacts check writers and attempts to collect
on dishonored checks and enroll the check writers in its pre-trial diversion program
without the DA having made a determination that âprobable cause of a bad check
violation under State penal law exists, and that contact with the alleged offender for
purposes of participation in the program is appropriate,â as required by 15 U.S.C.

Â§ 1692p(a)(2)(C)(iv)(D.

24. Inaddition, BounceBackâs letters do not contain a clear and conspicuous
statement that if the alleged offender notifies the private entity or the DA in writing, not
later than 30 days after being contacted for the first time pursuant to 15 U.S.C.

Â§ 1692p(a)(2)(C) (iv), that there is a dispute pursuant to 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1692p(a), then
further restitution efforts will not be pursued until the DA or an employee of the DA
authorized to make such a determination makes a determination that there is probable
cause to believe that a crime has been committed, as required by 15 U.S.C.

Â§ 1692p(a)(2)(C)(v) (1).

False, Deceptive, or Misleading
Representations in Connection with Collecting a Debt

a. BounceBack falsely represents that nonpayment will
result in criminal prosecution.

25. Ifa DAexpresses interest in using BounceBackâs services, BounceBack
sends it an initial packet explaining its pretrial-diversion program. The packet contains
templates of the collection letters BounceBack will send to check writers, which the DA

5
Case 5:20-cv-06179-BP Document1 Filed 12/09/20 Page 5 of 15
can change according to its preferences. Most DAs make few, if any, changes to the

template.

26. BounceBackâs collection letters state in several ways that a check writer

who does not pay the outstanding check amount and fees for the pretrial-diversion

program may face âcriminal chargesâ or âcriminal prosecutionâ:

da.

b.

âWARNING OF CRIMINAL CHARGESâ;

âthe total amount must be received ... to avoid possible criminal
charges being filedâ;

âpay the total listed below to avoid the possibility of criminal
prosecutionâ;

âIt is still possible to avoid a CRIMINAL CONVICTIONâ;

âWARNING... You have 48 hours to contact the Check
Enforcement Program, before your case is forwarded to final review
... Ifthe check(s) is not taken care of, a criminal complaint and a
WARRANT may be issued commanding you to appear in court and
CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS may resultâ;

âFailure to make payment in full within THIRTY (30) DAYS from
the date of this notice may be used as evidence in a possible
criminal prosecutionâ;

âIf payment can be arranged and compliance with the conditions of
the Check Enforcement Program are met, you may yet be able to
prevent the possibility of a WARRANT FOR YOUR ARREST being
issuedâ;

âTO COMPLY: 1) Pay the full dollar amount shown within thirty
days. 2) Complete the Check Writerâs Financial Training Courseâ;

âALL check writers whose checks have been referred to the Check
Enforcement Program MUST complete the Educational
Requirement to discharge the case as part of this diversion
programâ;

âFAILURE TO COMPLETE THE EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENT
CAN CAUSE YOUR CASE DIVERSION TO BE REVOKED.â

27. These threats are in almost all instances false.

6

Case 5:20-cv-06179-BP Document1 Filed 12/09/20 Page 6 of 15
28. Each DA gives BounceBack criteria for sending out its collection letters,
and different, often more stringent, criteria for determining which cases will be referred
back to the DA for a review for prosecution.

29. BounceBack sends collection letters to check writers who do not meet the
DAsâ criteria for referral for prosecution.

30. For example, at least 29 of the more than 90 jurisdictions that Bounce Back
has contracted with will not prosecute check writers if the dishonored check is belowa
certain amount, but BounceBack nevertheless threatens those check writers with
prosecution.

31. Moreover, even if a check writer qualifies for prosecution, BounceBack
rarely refers cases for potential prosecution.

32. Most DAs refuse to prosecute dishonored-check cases even if check writers
fail to respond to Bounce Backâs letters.

33. Finally, almost none of the check writers who enroll in the financial-
education course return the confirmation that they have completed the course, and
many never complete the course. Contrary to the threats in Bounce Backâs letters,
BounceBack never refers those check writers to the DA for possible prosecution.

b. BounceBack creates the false impression that the
collection letters it sends are coming directly froma DA.

34. BounceBackâs letters are sent on DA letterhead and appear to be
statements from the DA.

35. For instance, a typical letter bears the DAâs name and seal at the top. The
letter also tells the check payer to send payment to the â[DAâs] Check Enforcement

Program,â followed by an address that is actually BounceBackâs address.

7
Case 5:20-cv-06179-BP Document1 Filed 12/09/20 Page 7 of 15
36. The letter nowhere states that it was sent by BounceBack, even though the
letter comes directly from BounceBack, not a DA.

c. BounceBackâs collection letters do not reveal that
BounceBack is a debt collector.

37. BounceBack sends letters that fail to state anywhere that BounceBack is a
debt collector or that any information it obtains will be used for collections purposes,
nor does BounceBack disclose in subsequent letters or phone calls with check writers
that it is a debt collector.

38. Moreover, because its letters are sent on DA letterhead using the DAâs seal
and refer to the DAâs âCheck Enforcement Program,â it is unlikely that a recipient would
suspect that the letter is being sent by a debt collector.

d. BounceBack fails to include certain required dispute
notices in its collection letters.

39. |BounceBackâs collection letters fail to contain several required disclosures.

Ao. Severalof BounceBackâs letters state, âYOU MUST EITHER COMPLY BY
MAKING PAYMENT OR NOTIFY THE CHECK ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM IN
WRITING THAT YOU WISH TO DISPUTE THIS MATTER NO LATER THAN 320 DAYS
AFTER RECEIVING THIS NOTICE,â and âPAYMENT OR DIS[P] UTE MUST BE MADE
WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS FROM THE DATE OF THIS LETTER.â

41. Butthese same letters do not disclose that unless a recipient disputes the
validity of the debt within 30 days, the debt will be assumed valid; that if a recipient
disputes the validity of the debt within 30 days, the collector must verify the debt; or
that if a recipient makes a request within 30 days, the collector will provide the original

creditorâs name and address.

VIOLATIONS OF LAW
COUNT 1â Violations of the FDCPA
Falsely Representing that Nonpayment Would
Result in Criminal Prosecution

42. The Bureau re-alleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1-41.

43. Section 1692e(4) of the FDCPA prohibits â[t]he representation or
implication that nonpayment of any debt will result in the arrest or imprisonment of any
person or the seizure, garnishment, attachment, or sale of any property or wages of any
person unless such action is lawful and the debt collector or creditor intends to take
such action.â 15 U.S.C Â§ 1692e(4).

44. Section 1692e(5) of the FDCPA prohibits â[t]he threat to take any action
that cannot legally be taken or that is not intended to be taken.â 15 U.S.C Â§ 1692e(5).

45. Inconnection with collecting or attempting to collect debt from
consumers, BounceBack represented to consumers, directly or indirectly, expressly or
by implication, that nonpayment of a debt would result in arrest or imprisonment.

46. Infact, neither BounceBack nor the DAs intended to take such action.

47. These acts and practices violated Â§ 807(4) and (5) of the FDCPA, 15 U.S.C.
Â§ 1692e(4) & (5).

COUNT 2â Violations of the FDCPA

51. Inconnection with collecting or attempting to collect debt from
consumers, BounceBack represented to consumers, directly or indirectly, expressly or
by implication, that written communications distributed to consumers were issued from
an official or agency of a State.

52. Infact, the communications were from BounceBack, which used the
names of the DAs in connection with collecting or attempting to collect debts from
consumers.

53. | These acts and practices violated Â§ 807(9) and (14) of the FDCPA, 15
U.S.C. Â§ 1692e(9) & (14).

representation or deceptive means to collect or attempt to collect any debt or to obtain

56. BounceBack falsely represented that the failure to (a) pay the fees listed,
including the dishonored-check amount, administrative fees, and fees for the financial-
education course, and (b) complete the financial-education course, would lead to
criminal prosecution, when in fact it would not for the vast majority of debtors.

10
Case 5:20-cv-06179-BP Documenti1 Filed 12/09/20 Page 10 of 15
57. Moreover, BounceBack designed its collection letters to appear to come
directly from the DA when in fact they did not.

58. These acts and practices violated Â§ 807(10) of the FDCPA, 15 U.S.C.
Â§ 1692e(10).

COUNT 4âViolations of the FDCPA
Failing to Reveal that BounceBack was a Debt Collector

59. The Bureau re-alleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1-41.

the initial written communication with the consumer... that the debt collector is
attempting to collect a debt and that any information obtained will be used for that
purpose, and the failure to disclose in subsequent communications that the
communication is from a debt collector.â 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1692e(11).

61. BounceBackâs initial communications to consumers did not include that
required disclosure.

Â§ 1692e(11).

initial communication with a consumer in connection with the collection of any debt, a
debt collector shall, unless the following information is contained in the initial
communication or the consumer has paid the debt, send the consumer a written notice

containingâ several specific disclosures.

11

COUNT 6âViolations of the CFPA
Deceptive Representations that Failure to Pay the
Alleged Debt and Program Fees Would Result in Prosecution

68. The Bureau re-alleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1-41.

69. BounceBackâs collection letters contained threats that not paying the
alleged debt and required pretrial-diversion program fees would result in prosecution
when, in fact, it would not.

70. These representations were false because, in most cases, the DAs did not
intend to prosecute individuals who received collection letters threatening further action
or prosecution. And almost none of the check writers who failed to respond to
Bounce Backâs collection letters were ever referred to a DA for âreview for prosecution.â

71. | BounceBackâs misrepresentations were likely to mislead consumers acting
reasonably under the circumstances.

72. | BounceBackâs misrepresentations were material because they were likely
to affect the conduct or decisions of consumers regarding whether to pay the alleged
debt and any other program fees.

73. Therefore, BounceBack engaged in deceptive acts or practices that violated
the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. 88 5531(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).

74. The Bureau re-alleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1-41.

75. BounceBackâs collection letters stated that failure to complete the
financial-education course would result in criminal prosecution.

76. Infact, these representations were false because very few check writers
returned proof that they completed the financial-education course, but no check writers
were ever referred for criminal prosecution for that reason.

77.  BounceBackâs misrepresentations were likely to mislead consumers acting
reasonably under the circumstances.

78. | BounceBackâs misrepresentations were material because they were likely
to affect the conduct or decisions of consumers regarding whether to pay the program
fees for the financial-education course.
