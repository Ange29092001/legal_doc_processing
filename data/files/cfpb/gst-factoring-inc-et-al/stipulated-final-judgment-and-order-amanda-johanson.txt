rule, the Telemarketing Sales Rule (TSR), 16 C.F.R. Part 310. The Bureau alleged that
the Defendants engaged in abusive telemarketing practices in violation of the TSR by
requesting and receiving payment of unlawful advance fees from consumers seeking
debt-relief services for their private student loans.

Defendant Amanda Johanson was duly served on October 14, 2020 (ECF 40), but
she failed to file an answer or otherwise respond to the Complaint. The clerk entered
default against Defendant Johanson (Defaulting Defendant) on November 10, 2020. ECF
47. The Bureau has filed an Application for Entry of Default Judgment and Order for
Permanent Injunction, Monetary Relief, and Civil Money Penalties against Defaulting
Defendant pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(b)(2) and Local Rules 55-1 and 55-2. The
Court, having considered the Bureauâs application, supporting declarations and exhibits

and other evidence filed in this matter, finds good cause to grant the relief requested.
THEREFORE, it is HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED as

 

follows:

7. Defaulting Defendant is not a minor, an incompetent person, or current
member of the military service.

8. Defaulting Defendant was served with written notice of the Application via
email on December 7, 2020, at least seven days before any hearing on the Application.
The written notice included the amount of the money judgment requested, comprised of
restitution and civil money penalties, in the Bureauâs Application.

9. The Bureauâs Complaint states a claim upon which relief may be granted.

10. The allegations in the Complaint, except with respect to damages, are taken
as true because of Defaulting Defendantâs default.

11. Judgment is entered on behalf of the Bureau and against Defaulting
Defendant on Count I of the Complaint.

12. This Court is empowered to issue injunctive relief, monetary relief, and civil
money penalties pursuant to 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5565.

13. The Bureau is entitled to an Order imposing a permanent injunction against
Defaulting Defendant and requiring Defaulting Defendant to pay restitution in the
amount of $4,992,606, and to pay civil money penalties in the amount of $5,000,000.

14. This action and the relief awarded in this Order are in addition to, and not in
lieu of, other remedies as may be provided by law, including both civil and criminal
remedies.

15. Entry of this Order is in the public interest.

Defaulting Defendant Violated the TSR By Requesting and Receiving Advance Fees
For a Telemarketed Debt-Relief Service (Count I)

16. Defaulting Defendant, having entered into engagement agreements with
consumers in connection with telemarketing to provide a debt-relief service purported to
reduce or eliminate those consumersâ private student-loan debts primarily through
negotiation, charged those consumers fees on a monthly basis starting at or just after

enrollment, and before their debts were reduced or eliminated.

17.  Detfaulting Defendant, as a seller under the TSR, unlawfully requested and
received payment of fees for debt-relief services before the terms of at least one of the
consumerâs debts had been negotiated, settled, reduced, or otherwise altered pursuant to
an agreement executed by the consumer; and the consumer had made at least one
payment pursuant to that agreement, in violation of the TSR. 16 C.F.R.

Â§ 310,.4(a)(5)G)(A)-(B).
Basis for Equitable and Monetary Relief

18. The Bureau is proceeding on behalf of thousands of financially distressed
individuals unlawfully charged millions of dollars for debt-relief services. Consumer Fin.
Prot. Bureau v. Siringoringo, No. SACV1401155JVSAJWX, 2016 WL 102435, at *6
(C.D. Cal. Jan. 7, 2016). Considering the balance of hardships and the public interest, the
public interest is served by an injunction preventing Defaulting Defendant from engaging
in behavior related to her previous legal conduct. FTC v. Affordable Media, 179 F.3d
1228, 1236 (9th Cir. 1999). Defaulting Defendant was involved in an elaborate, illegal

scheme from its inception, in which she participated for three years, and therefore

 

broader âfencing-inâ relief provisions help to âprevent similar and related violations from
occurring in the future.â World Accounts, Inc. v. FTC, 594 F.2d 212, 215 (9th Cir. 1979).
Accordingly, the permanent injunction ordered in Sections I and II below constitutes
âappropriate ... equitable relief.â 12 U.S.C. $$ 5564(a), 5565(a).

19. Legal restitution is âmeasured by the loss to consumers.â FTC v. Inc21.com
Corp., 475 F. Appâx 106, 108 (9th Cir. 2012); see also Consumer Fin. Prot. Bureau v.
Gordon, 819 F.3d 1179, 1195 (9th Cir. 2016) (the appropriate measure for restitution is
the âfull amount lost by consumers rather than limiting damages to a defendantâs
profits.â) (quoting FTC v. Stefanchik, 559 F.3d 924, 931 (9th Cir. 2009)).

20. The Bureau has established, through competent evidence, that Defaulting
Defendant received $4,992,606 in unlawful advance fees, net of refunds, from 1,024

consumers, providing a basis for the monetary judgment amount ordered in Section III.

21. A penalty amount of $5,000,000 against the Defaulting Defendant is
appropriate. Defaulting Defendant acted knowingly, or at least recklessly, and therefore,
she could be subject to much higher penalties, but in light of the applicable mitigating

factors, the lower penalty as ordered in Section IV is warranted. 12 U.S.C.

$Â§ 5565(c)(2)(B), (C), (c)(3).
