Bureau Findings and Conclusions

The Bureau finds the following:
Accelerate is a Delaware limited liability corporation with its principal place

of business in Newark, Delaware.

Accelerate is licensed to engage in business as a mortgage broker and lender
in about 31 states.

Accelerate is a âperson,â as defined in the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(19),
Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.2(a)(22), and the MAP Rule, 12 C.F.R. Â§
1014.2, because it is a limited liability corporation.

During the Relevant Period, Accelerate has been a âcovered personâ under
the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(6)(A), because it is a person that engages in

offering and providing residential-mortgage loans, which are âconsumer

financial product[s] or service[s]â under the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(5), (6),
(15)(A)Q).

During the Relevant Period, Accelerate has been subject to the MAP Rule
because it is a person over which the Federal Trade Commission has
jurisdiction under the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 41-58.
12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.1. The MAP Rule is a Federal consumer financial law. 12
U.S.C. Â§ 5481(14).

Accelerate provides âmortgage credit product[s],â as that term is defined in
the MAP Rule. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.2.

Accelerateâs mortgage advertisements are âcommercial communicationsâ
regarding a term of a âmortgage credit product,â as those terms are defined
in 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.2.

During the Relevant Period, Accelerate has offered âclosed-end creditâ in
the form of mortgage loans to âconsumers,â as those terms are defined in
Regulation Z. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.2(a)(10) & (11).

Accelerateâs mortgage advertisements are advertisements for âclosed-end
credit,â as that term is defined in Regulation Z. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.2(a)(10).
Accelerate offers consumer mortgages, including mortgages guaranteed by

the VA.

Accelerateâs principal means of advertising VA-guaranteed mortgages is
through direct-mail advertisements sent to consumers, including veterans
and servicemembers.

Since April 2018, Accelerate has mailed more than a million mortgage

advertisements to consumers in at least 31 states.

False, Misleading, and Inaccurate Representations

Federal consumer financial law contains numerous provisions banning the
use of misleading and deceptive statements in mortgage advertisements.
Despite those prohibitions, Accelerate was responsible for both the content
of, and dissemination of, numerous mortgage advertisements during the
Relevant Period that contained false, misleading, and inaccurate statements,
as described below.

False, Misleading, and Inaccurate
Representations About Cost and Other Credit Terms

Numerous Accelerate mortgage advertisements stated specific credit terms,
such as an interest rate, payment amount, or closing costs.

By stating specific credit terms in its advertisements, Accelerate represented,
expressly or by implication, that it arranged or offered a mortgage with those
credit terms.

In fact, Accelerate did not offer or arrange mortgages with the specific credit

terms stated in many of those advertisements.

In numerous instances, Accelerate misrepresented the actual credit terms
applicable to the mortgages that it would arrange or offer.

Numerous Accelerate mortgage advertisements misrepresented the interest
rate applicable to the advertised mortgage.

Specifically, Accelerate advertisements sent to 7,105 consumers in April
2018 advertised a VA cash-out refinance loan with a fixed simple interest
rate of 3.75%. But the lowest available rate at the time for a VA cash-out
refinance loan offered by Accelerate was 4.875%.

Numerous Accelerate mortgage advertisements misrepresented the payment
amount applicable to the advertised mortgage and the existence, nature, or
amount of cash or credit available to the consumer in connection with the
advertised mortgage.

For example, Accelerate advertisements sent to 13,544 consumers in March
and April 2019 stated that the borrower could âaccess $20,000 for only
$95.05 per monthâ with a VA loan.

In reality, obtaming any cash-out amount against the consumerâs home
equity would be possible only if the consumer had an existing mortgage and
refinanced the entire amount owed on that mortgage as part of a cash-out

refinance mortgage, resulting in a total monthly payment larger than $95.05.

Numerous Accelerate mortgage advertisements misrepresented the existence
and amount of fees or costs to the consumer.

Specifically, Accelerate advertisements sent to 7,105 consumers in April
2018 stated that there were âNo Closing Costsâ for the advertised loan.

All VA loans have closing costs, and Accelerate has never closed a VA loan
without closing costs. Thus, consumers would need to pay closing costs for
the loan featured in these advertisements. Accordingly, in connection with
the loan that Accelerate was advertising, the statement âNo Closing Costsâ
was false.

Consumers who received the advertisements described in paragraphs 26-33
were likely to be misled by them.

The advertisements were also likely to affect consumersâ conduct or
decisions with regard to obtaining a loan.

False and Misleading Representations About an
Affiliation with the Government

Numerous Accelerate mortgage advertisements falsely represented, directly
or by implication, through the use of formats, symbols, or logos that
resemble those of a governmental entity such as the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), that the

provider of the advertised mortgage was, or was affiliated with, a
37.

38.

2020-BCFP-0014 Document1 Filed 09/02/2020 Page 10 of 48

governmental entity, that the advertisement was sent by or on behalf of the
VA or another governmental entity, or that the advertised product related to
a federal tax benefit, or was endorsed, sponsored by, or affiliated with the
IRS or the FDIC.

For example, Accelerate advertisements sent to 381,829 consumers from
April through October 2018 were formatted to look like a notification letter

from the IRS. The top of these advertisements appeared as follows:

A018

sam
hl

 

ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE

1*41 #1 eer ALL FOR AADC 207

 

The advertisements included the year â2018â printed in block numbers in the
top right corner with the â20â in white and the â18â in black, a distinctive
format used by the IRS. In the top left corner, where the name of the sender
would normally appear, was a QR Code, and underneath that the words in
bold âADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE.â The combined effect made the return
address/sender portion of the advertisements look like an IRS return address

block and gave the impression that the communication was coming from the

IRS.

These advertisements were formatted as letters to the consumer, witha
greeting followed by two sections headed âNOTICEâ and âSTATUS.â The
body of the letter instructed the consumer to âplease call our VA Program
Customer Support Representativeâ and to reference a specified âNOTICE
NUMBERâ on the call. Accelerateâs name did not appear anywhere in the
body of the letter. Instead, Accelerateâs logo was relegated to the bottom of
the page, just above the fine print. Accelerateâs logo incorporated an image
resembling the American flag, which added to the impression that the
communication was from an official government source.

Similarly, Accelerate advertisements sent to 42,311 consumers from July
through October 2018 used the IRSâs distinctive black and white block letter
formatting of the year â2018,â and displayed a QR Code next to the words
âADMINISTRATIVE OFFICEâ where the senderâs name would normally
appear.

These advertisements also instructed the consumer to call âour VA Program
Representative... to receive a detailed explanation of the benefits available
and how to access them.â In addition to these characteristics, this instruction
implied that if consumers called the toll-free number provided, they would

be connected to someone affiliated with the VA who could advise them on

their benefits, rather than an employee of a third-party mortgage broker or
lender interested in convincing them to refinance their current mortgage.

In another example, Accelerate advertisements sent to 30,500 consumers in
October 2018 were formatted to look like an official citation or ticket, as

follows:

The use of the words âEXPIRATION NOTICEâ in bold with reference to
the property address and county in which the property was located,
combined with the barcode along the left-hand side and the details about the
âNotice Typeâ and âNotice Number,â created the impression that the
document was from a government agency.

In another example, Accelerate advertisements sent to 6,501 consumers in
April 2018 displayed an official âMember FDICâ logo, even though
Accelerate is not and has never been a member of the FDIC.

were likely to be misled by them.
The advertisements were also likely to affect consumersâ conduct or

decisions with regard to obtaining a loan.

False and Misleading Representations About Time Limits on VA Loan Benefits

47.

48.

49.

50.

S1.

Numerous Accelerate mortgage advertisements falsely represented that the
consumerâs access to mortgage-refinance benefits through VA-guaranteed
loans was time-limited.

For example, Accelerate advertisements sent to 56,497 consumers in July
2019 stated: âThis VA Cash-Out program is available to Veterans like you!
This offer is available to you through July 15, 2019.â The advertisements
provided general information about VA cash-out refinance loans, such as
stating that the cash-out refinance loan, including the consumerâs existing
mortgage balance, could be for up to 100% of the homeâs value. The
advertisements did not provide any time-sensitive mortgage terms such as
interest rate, APR, or payment amount.

This statement above represented that the veteranâs access to benefits under
the âVA Cash-Out programâ would expire after July 15, 2019.

In fact, that representation was false because a veteranâs eligibility for and
access to the benefits of a VA loan never expire.

Reasonable consumers who received the advertisements described in

paragraphs 47-50 were likely to be misled by them under the circumstances.
The advertisements were also likely to affect consumersâ conduct or
decisions with regard to obtaining a loan.

Inadequate Disclosures
Many of Accelerateâs mortgage advertisements stated a period of repayment
or the amount of a payment. Under certain sections of Regulation Z,
including Â§ 1026.24(d) and (f), the use of these terms triggers specific
disclosure requirements. Many of the advertisements did not include the
other disclosures that are required or did not include them in the manner
required.
Numerous Accelerate mortgage advertisements stated the period of
repayment or the amount of a payment, but failed to state the terms of
repayment reflecting the consumerâs repayment obligations over the full
term of the loan.
For example, the advertisements for cash-out refinance loans described in
Paragraphs 29-30 above stated a payment amount but failed to state the
terms of repayment reflecting the repayment obligations over the full term of
the loan. Specifically, the advertisements disclosed terms of repayment only
for the portion of the loan that would be used to cash out the $20,000

amount against the consumerâs home equity; they did not disclose the terms

of repayment for the full amount of the advertised cash-out refinance loan
over the full term of the loan.

In another example, Accelerate advertisements sent to 20,002 consumers in
November 2018 stated that the advertised mortgage would have a monthly
payment of $1,304.12.

Although these advertisements stated a payment amount, they failed to state
the annual percentage rate (APR) of the advertised mortgage.

Numerous Accelerate mortgage advertisements stated the amount of a
payment, but failed to state the amount of each payment that would apply
over the term of the loan; failed to clearly and conspicuously state the period
during which each payment would apply; or failed to state the fact that the
advertised payments did not include amounts for taxes and insurance
premiums, if applicable, and that the actual payment obligation would be
greater, or failed to do so clearly and conspicuously.

For example, the advertisements for cash-out refinance loans described in
Paragraphs 29-30 above disclosed only the monthly payment amount for the
portion of the loan that would be used to take out the advertised cash-out
amount. Although these advertisements stated a payment amount, they failed
to disclose the full amount of each payment that would apply over the term

of the loan. These advertisements also did not contain an equally prominent
60.

61.

62.

and closely proximate statement of the period during which each payment
would apply, as Regulation Z requires in Â§ 1026.24(f)(3). The term of the
loan was stated only in fine print at the bottom. Theadvertisements also
failed to disclose that the payment amount did not include amounts for taxes
and insurance premiums, if applicable, and that the actual payment
obligation would be greater.

VIOLATIONS OF REGULATION Z

Unavailable Credit Terms, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(a)
Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(a), â[i]fan advertisement for credit states
specific credit terms, it shall state only those terms that actually are or will
be arranged or offered by the creditor.â
Accelerate violated Â§ 1026.24(a) because, as described in Paragraphs 22-33,
numerous Accelerate advertisements for credit stated specific credit terms
other than those terms that actually were or would be arranged or offered by

the creditor.

Terms of Repayment, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(d)
Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(d)(1), ifan advertisement sets forth any of the
four specified triggering terms (the amount or percentage of any
downpayment, the number of payments or period of repayment, the amount

of any payment, or the amount of any finance charge), the advertisement
must also state, among other things, â[t]he terms of repayment, which reflect
the repayment obligations over the full term of the loan, including any
balloon paymentâ and the APR of the loan. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(d)(1),
(2)(i1), (iti).

63. Accelerate violated Â§ 1026.24(d) because, as described in Paragraphs 54-57,
numerous Accelerate mortgage advertisements set forth the period of
repayment or the amount of any payment, which are triggering terms under Â§
1026.24(d)(1)(ii) and (11), but failed to state the repayment obligations over
the full term of the loan, pursuant to Â§ 1026.24(d)(2)(i1) or the APR of the

loan, pursuant to Â§ 1026.24(d)(2)(in).
Inadequate Disclosure of Payment Terms, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(f)(3)(i)

64. Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(f)(3)(), a direct-mail mortgage advertisement
that âstates the amount of any paymentâ must disclose, in a clear and
conspicuous manner:

(A) The amount of each payment that will apply over the term
of the loan, including any balloon payment. In variable-rate
transactions, payments that will be determined based on the
application of the sum of an index and margin shall be
disclosed based on a reasonably current index and margin;

(B) The period of time during which each payment will apply;
and

(C) In an advertisement for credit secured by a first lien ona
dwelling, the fact that the payments do not include amounts
65.

66.

67.

for taxes and insurance premiums, if applicable, and that the
actual payment obligation will be greater.

Accelerate violated Â§ 1026.24(f)(3)(1) because, as described in Paragraphs
58-59, numerous Accelerate direct-mail mortgage advertisements stated the
amount of a payment but did not include one or more of the disclosures
required pursuant to Â§ 1026.24(f)(3)(4)(A) through (C), or did not disclose

them clearly and conspicuously, as defined in Â§ 1026.24(f)(3)(i).

VIOLATIONS OF THE MAP RULE (REGULATION N)
Misrepresentations About Rates, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.3(b)

Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.3(b), it is a violation for any person subject to the
MAP Rule to make any misrepresentation, directly or indirectly, expressly
or by implication, in any commercial communication, about â|t]he annual
percentage rate, simple annual rate, periodic rate, or any other rateâ
applicable to a mortgage credit product. Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.3, sucha
misrepresentation is specifically prohibited and is therefore material.
Accelerate violated Â§ 1014.3(b) because, as described in Paragraphs 26-27,
numerous Accelerate mortgage advertisements contained misrepresentations

about the interest rate applicable to a mortgage credit product.

or credit as part of a mortgage credit transaction.â Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.3,

74. Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.3(n), it is a violation for any person subject to the
MAP Rule to make any misrepresentation, directly or indirectly, expressly
or by implication, in any commercial communication, about:

but not limited to misrepresentations that:

(1) The provider is, or is affiliated with, any

Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.3, such a misrepresentation is specifically
prohibited and is therefore material.

75. Accelerate violated Â§ 1014.3(n) because, as described in Paragraphs 36-44,
numerous Accelerate mortgage advertisements contained misrepresentations
that the provider of the advertised mortgage credit product was, or was

affiliated with, a governmental entity; that the advertised product related to a

VIOLATIONS OF THE CFPA

Under the CFPA, it is unlawful for any covered person or service provider to
engage in a deceptive act or practice in connection with any transaction with
a consumer for a consumer-financial product or service, or the offering of a
consumer-financial product or service. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).
An act or practice is deceptive if it involves a material misrepresentation or
omission that is likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under the
circumstances.

Information that is likely to affect a consumerâs choice of, or conduct

regarding, a product or service 1s material to consumers.
Deceptive Representations About Credit Terms

In numerous instances, as described in Paragraphs 22-35, Accelerateâs
mortgage advertisements represented, expressly or by implication, that
specific credit terms were available or would be arranged or offered by the
creditor, including representations about specific interest rates, payment

amounts, or closing costs stated in those advertisements, when in fact those

specific credit terms were not available or were not terms that Accelerate

was actually prepared to arrange or offer.

Accelerateâs misrepresentations about the availability ofthe advertised
credit terms of the advertised mortgage were likely to mislead consumers
acting reasonably under the circumstances.

Accelerateâs misrepresentations about the credit terms of the advertised
mortgage were material because they were likely to affect the conduct or
decisions of consumers.

Therefore, Accelerate engaged in deceptive acts and practices in violation of

the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).
Deceptive Representations About Government Affiliation

In numerous instances, as described in Paragraphs 36â46, Accelerateâs
mortgage advertisements represented, expressly or by implication, that
Accelerate was affiliated with a governmental entity; that the advertised
product related to a federal tax benefit; that the advertised product was
endorsed, sponsored by, or affiliated with a governmental entity such as the
IRS or the FDIC; or that the advertisement was sent by or on behalf of the
VA or another governmental entity.

In fact, Accelerate was not affiliated with the government and the advertised

product did not relate to a federal tax benefit; the advertised product was not

endorsed, sponsored by, or affiliated with the IRS or the FDIC; and the
advertisement was not sent by or on behalf of the VA or another
governmental entity.
Accelerateâs misrepresentations about government affiliation were likely to
mislead consumers acting reasonably under the circumstances.
Accelerateâs misrepresentations about government affiliation were material
because they were likely to affect the conduct or decisions of consumers.
Therefore, Accelerate engaged in deceptive acts and practices in violation of
the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).

Deceptive Representations About Time Limits on VA Loan Benefits
In numerous instances, as described in Paragraphs 47-52, Accelerateâ s
mortgage advertisements represented, expressly or by implication, that a
veteranâs access to mortgage-refinance benefits through VA-guaranteed
loans was time-limited.
In fact, a veteranâs eligibility for and access to the benefits of a VA loan
never expire.
Accelerateâs misrepresentations about time limits on VA loan benefits were
likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under the circumstances.
Accelerateâs misrepresentations about time limits on VA loan benefits were

material because they were likely to affect the conduct or decisions of

consumers.
Therefore, Accelerate engaged in deceptive acts and practices in violation of
the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).

Violations of the CFPA Based on Violations of
Regulation Zand the MAP Rule

Under the CFP A, a covered personâs violation of a Federal consumer
financial law, which includes enumerated consumer laws and rules

thereunder, violates the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5536(a)(1)(A), 5481(14).

Regulation Z and the MAP Rule are Federal consumer financial laws.

Accelerateâs violations of Regulation Z and the MAP Rule, described in
Paragraphs 60-75, constitute violations of Â§ 1036(a)(1)(A) of the CFPA. 12

U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(A).
