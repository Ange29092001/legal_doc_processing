Bureau Findings and Conclusions

The Bureau finds the following:

4.

Respondent is a federally insured, for-profit national bank headquartered in
Seattle, Washington.

Respondent is an insured depository institution with total assets greater than
$10,000,000 within the meaning of 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5515(a). Respondentâs total
assets as of December 31, 2016, were about $14,873,654,000; its total assets
as of December 31, 2017, were about $15,584,013,000.

Respondent is a âcovered personâ under 12 U.S.C. Â§5481(6).

Respondent originated more than $1 billion in 2016 and $1 billion again in
2017 in home-purchase loans, including refinancings of home-purchase
loans.

On December 3 |st of both 2016 and 2017, Respondent had a branch office
that was approved by a federal agency in a Metropolitan Statistical Area

(MSA) for HMDA-reporting purposes.
10.

11.

12.

13.

14.

15.

16.

In 2016 and 2017, Respondent received applications for, originated, or
purchased over ftve Covered Loans related to properties in multiple MSAs
or Metropolitan Divisions.

Respondent is a federally insured or regulated entity. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1003.2.
Respondent is a depository institution required to report HMDA data as
defined in Regulation C, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1003.2.

Including refinancings of home-purchase loans, Respondent originated more
than 3,484 home-purchase loans in 2016 and 3,284 home-purchase loans in
2017.

Respondent reported data on over 7,000 Covered Loans on each of its 2016
and 2017 HMDA LARs. On March 1, 2017, Respondent submitted its 2016
HMDA LAR. On March 1, 2018, Respondent submitted its 2017 HMDA
LAR, and on May 24, 2018, resubmitted its 2017 LAR.

Respondentâs 2016 HMDA LAR submission and 2017 HMDA LAR
Submission and resubmission to the Bureau included significant errors that
exceeded the applicable thresholds.

An internal audit of Respondentâs 2016 HMDA LAR identified 40 files
containing errors in a review of 100 files, a 40% error rate.

A Bureau review of 84 files in Respondentâs initial 2017 HMDA LAR

identified 58 errors in 27 files, a 32% sample error rate.

With respect to Respondentâs resubmitted 2017 HMDA LAR, the Bureau
reviewed 81 files and identified 21 errors in 13 files, a 16% sample error
rate.

These sample error rates indicate the presence of large numbers of errors in
the LAR that exceed the applicable thresholds.

The 2016 HMDA errors were caused by a lack of appropriate staff,
insufficient staff training, and ineffective quality control.

The 2017 HMDA errors are directly related to weaknesses in Respondentâs
compliance-management system (CMS), especially in the areas of Board
and management oversight, monitoring, and policies and procedures.

In connection with its 2017 LAR resubmission, Respondent imposed an
incorrect policy, which directly led to the errors in its resubmitted LAR.
Respondent failed to put in place an adequate system of monitoring controls
that could promptly identify and correct weaknesses and violations in the
2016 and 2017 HMDA LAR.

The occurrence of errors in many different fields, rather than concentrated in
one or two fields, indicates broad CMS failures and a lack of adequate
resources, because the errors were not caught, and the errors cannot be

directly attributed to one or two systemic failures.
24.

25.

26.

27.

28.

The Bureau entered a consent order against Respondent on October 9, 2013,
finding that Respondent violated HMDA and Regulation C. The 2013
consent order required Respondent to review, correct, and resubmit its 2011
HMDA LAR and imposed a $34,000 penalty.

Respondent continued, after the Bureauâs 2013 consent order, to report
inaccurate HMDA data with error rates that exceed applicable thresholds.
Respondent has not maintained a CMS with procedures reasonably adapted
to avoid HMDA LAR errors, and thus the errors are intentional and not bona
fide errors.

Bureau Findings and Conclusions as to
Violations of HMDA and Regulation C

As implemented by Regulation C, HMDA requires covered institutions to
collect and report mortgage-loan data regarding applications for, originations
of, and purchases of home-purchase loans, home-improvement loans, and
refinancings for each calendar year. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 2802(3), (5), 2803; 12
C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1003.2 (definition of âfinancial institutionâ), 1003.4(a), (b).
Respondent is required to collect and report dataon Covered Loans in
compliance with HMDA and Regulation C. 12 U.S.C. Â§$ 2802(3), (5), 2803;

12 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1003.2 (definition of âfinancial institutionâ), 1003.4(a), (b).

Respondentâs 2016 HMDA LAR submission and 2017 HMDA LAR
submission and resubmission to the Bureau included significant errors that
exceeded the applicable thresholds.
Between at least January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2017, Respondent did
not maintain procedures reasonably adapted to avoid errors in its HMDA
LAR.
Respondent knew or should have known of the inadequacies of its HMDA
compliance mechanisms and the substantial risk of HMDA reporting errors
in its 2016 and 2017 LAR submissions and 2017 resubmission.
Respondentâs HMDA-reporting errors are not bona fide errors within the
meaning of Regulation C. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1003.6(b).
Respondentâs 2016 and 2017 submissions and 2017 resubmission contained
errors, in violation of HMDA, 12 U.S.C. Â§ 2803, and Regulation C, 12
C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1003.4, 1003.5.

Findings and Conclusions as to Violations of the CFPA
Section 1036(a)(1)(A) of the CFPA prohibits a covered person from offering
or providing to a consumer any financial product or service not in
conformity with âFederal consumer financial lawâ or otherwise committing
any act or omission in violation of a âFederal consumer financial law.â 12

U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(A); 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(12), (14).
35. Respondentâs HMDA and Regulation C violations, described above,
constitute violations of Â§ 1036(a)(1)(A) of the CFPA. 12 U.S.C.

the civil money penalty paid in this action. If the court in any Related
Consumer Action offsets or otherwise reduces the amount of compensatory
monetary remedies imposed against Respondent based on the civil money
penalty paid in this action or based on any payment that the Bureau makes
from the Civil Penalty Fund, Respondent must, within 30 days after entry of
a final order granting such offset or reduction, notify the Bureau, and pay the
amount of the offset or reduction to the U.S. Treasury. Such a payment will
