IV.
Bureau Findings and Conclusions

The Bureau finds the following:

4. Lobel is a California corporation with its principal place of business in

Anaheim, California.
10.

Lobel indirectly originates and services subprime auto loans by taking
assignment of retail-installment-sales contracts that automobile dealers make
with borrowers.

These activities are âconsumer financial products and servicesâ under the
CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(5), IS(A)(G) & (x).

Lobel is therefore a âcovered personâ under the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(6).
Since 2008, Lobel has used LDW. The LDW product is not an insurance
product, though Lobel uses it as a substitute for collateral-protection
insurance.

The LDW agreement specifies that if at any time the borrower fails to
maintain car insurance subject to certain specifications, Lobel will add LDW
coverage to the consumerâs account. When Lobel adds LDW coverage,
Lobel charges the consumer a monthly premium and, in the event of a repair,
Lobel will pay the cost of the repair. In the event of a âtotal vehicle loss,â
Lobel will cancel the borrowerâs debt.

Lobel charges a $70 monthly premium, on average, for LDW coverage.
11.

12.

13.

14.

15.

Findings and Conclusions as to
Charging Delinquent Consumers for LDW

The LDW agreement allows Lobel to cancel the agreement and suspend
coverage if the borrower becomes delinquent on his or her loan by 10 or
more days.

When consumers became 10 days delinquent on their loans, however, Lobel
did not stop charging the monthly premium or otherwise indicate that it was
canceling the LDW coverage. Instead, Lobel continued to charge these
consumers, even though it no longer provided them with LDW coverage.
And when many of these consumers, who had become more than 10 days
delinquent on their auto loans, experienced a âtotal vehicle lossâ or needed a
repair, Lobel denied their claims and did not cancel their debts or cover their
repairs.

Since 2012, in the course of administering the LDW product, at least 2,919
consumers paid monthly LDW premiums when they were more than 10 days
delinquent, yet Lobel did not provide those consumers with LDW coverage.
In addition, since 2012, at least 451 consumers submitted LDW claims for
either âtotal vehicle lossâ or repair that Lobel denied as though their

coverage had been canceled.
16.

17.

18.

19.

Lobel improperly denied at least 261 additional consumersâ LD W claims
and improperly furnished information to the consumer-reporting agencies
indicating that these consumers have outstanding debts totaling at least
$1,744,902.53, as a portion of the debts should not have been charged to the
consumers under the LDW agreement.

These acts and practices violated the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. $$ 5531(c), 5536(a).

Findings and Conclusions as to
Charging Consumers Fees in Excess of $500

The LDW agreement states that when Lobel declares that a vehicle is a total
loss, the borrower must pay the following fees and charges: the first $500 in
damages per loss occurrence; all past-due payments; interest in arrears
through the date of loss; all past-due LDW fees; all late charges; all legal or
collection or repossession fees; impound fees; storage or towing costs
exceeding $150 related to the damage occurrence; and lost-salvage fees
resulting from a lien sale or other event where Lobel cannot recover the
salvage value of the damaged motor vehicle.

Yet, in numerous instances, Lobel assessed and collected two additional fees
not listed in the LDW agreement: (1) the vehicleâs salvage value (even if the
borrower did not wish to retain the vehicle for salvage) and (2) monthly loan

payments from the time the LDW claim was approved and Lobel declared
20.

21.

22.

23.

the vehicle a total loss until the debt was canceled (a process that took Lobel,
on average, 3 months to complete).
Since at least 2011, Lobel assessed and collected LDW claim-related fees
that borrowers were not contractually obligated to pay under their
agreements with Lobel.
In total, at least 607 consumers paid $352,895 in excessive fees during this
period.
These acts and practices violated the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. $$ 5531(c), 5536(a).
V.
Prohibited Conduct
IT IS ORDERED, under Â§Â§ 1053 and 1055 of the CFPA, that:
Respondent and its officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys who
have actual notice of this Consent Order, whether acting directly or
indirectly, in connection with the origination and servicing of auto loans, are
permanently restrained and enjoined from:
a. failing to provide consumers with LDW coverage, collateral protection
insurance, or similar products or services for which Respondent has
charged consumers; or

b. charging consumers fees that are not authorized by its LDW contracts.
24.

25.

26.

VI.
Role of the Board
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that:
The Board must review all submissions (including plans, reports, programs,
policies, and procedures) required by this Consent Order before their
submission to the Bureau.
Although this Consent Order requires Respondent to submit certain
documents to the Regional Director for review or non-objection, the Board
will have the ultimate responsibility for Respondentâs proper and sound
management and for ensuring that Respondent complies with the laws that
the Bureau enforces, including Federal consumer financial laws and this
Consent Order.
Whenever this Consent Order requires the Board to perform or ensure
Respondentâs adherence to certain obligations, the Board must:
a. authorize whatever actions are necessary for Respondent to fully
comply with the Consent Order;

b. require timely reporting by management to the Board on the status of

compliance obligations; and

C. require timely and appropriate corrective action to remedy any
material non-compliance with any failures to comply with Board
directives related to this Section.

VIL.
Order to Pay Redress

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that:

Within 10 days of the Effective Date, Respondent must reserve or deposit

$1,345,224 into a segregated deposit account for the purpose of providing

redress to Affected Consumers as required by this Section.

Within 30 days of the Effective Date, Respondent must submit to the

Enforcement Director for review and non-objection a comprehensive written

plan for providing redress consistent with this Consent Order (Redress Plan).

The Enforcement Director will have the discretion to non-object to the

Redress Plan or to direct Respondent to revise it. If the Enforcement

Director directs Respondent to revise the Redress Plan, Respondent must

revise and resubmit the Redress Plan to the Enforcement Director within 15

days. After receiving notification that the Enforcement Director has no

objection to the Redress Plan, Respondent must implement and adhere to the

steps, recommendations, deadlines, and timeframes outlined in the Redress

Plan.
The Redress Plan must:
a. provide the form, e.g., certified or bank check, in which the required

redress shall be provided to the Affected Consumers;

b. provide the method that will be used to deliver redress to the Affected
Consumers and to ensure the redress was received; and

C. provide the procedure that will be used to request that Consumer
Reporting Agencies (CRAs) to which Respondent furnished
inaccurate information about Affected Consumers, correct or update
the inaccurate information in accordance with 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1681s-
2(a)(2). Where Respondent cannot furnish a correction or update,
Respondent will request that the CRAs to which it furnished the
information delete the tradeline.

After completing the Redress Plan, if the amount of redress provided to

Affected Consumers is less than $1,345,224, within 30 days of the

completion of the Redress Plan, Respondent must pay to the Bureau, by wire

transfer to the Bureau or to the Bureauâs agent, and according to the

11

Bureauâs wiring instructions, the difference between the amount of redress
provided to Affected Consumers and $1,345,224.
The Bureau may use these remaining funds to pay additional redress to
Aftected Consumers. If the Bureau determines, in its sole discretion, that
additional redress is wholly or partially impracticable or otherwise
inappropriate, or if funds remain after the additional redress is completed,
the money will not revert to Respondent. Respondent will have no right to
challenge any actions that the Bureau or its representatives may take under
this Section.
Respondent may not condition the payment of any redress to any Affected
Consumer under this Consent Order on that Affected Consumer waiving any
right.
VI.

Order to Pay Civil Money Penalty
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that:
Under Â§ 1055(c) of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5565(c), by reason of the
violations of law described in Section IV of this Consent Order and by
taking into account the factors in 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5565(c)(3), Respondent must

pay the Bureau a $100,000 civil money penalty.

Within 10 days of the Effective Date, Respondent must pay the civil money

penalty by wire transfer to the Bureau or to the Bureauâs agent in

compliance with the Bureauâs wiring instructions.

The civil money penalty paid under this Consent Order will be deposited in

the Bureauâs Civil Penalty Fund, as required by Â§ 1017(d) of the CFPA, 12

U.S.C. Â§ 5497(d).

Respondent, for all purposes, must treat the civil money penalty paid under

this Consent Order as a penalty paid to the government. Regardless of how

the Bureau ultimately uses those funds, Respondent may not:

a. claim, assert, or apply for a tax deduction, tax credit, or any other tax
benefit for any civil money penalty paid under this Consent Order; or

b. seek or accept, directly or indirectly, reimbursement or
indemnification from any source, including but not limited to payment
made under any insurance policy, for any civil money penalty paid
under this Consent Order.

To preserve the civil money penaltyâs deterrent effect, Respondent may not

argue in any Related Consumer Action that Respondent is entitled to, nor

may Respondent benefit by, any offset or reduction of any compensatory

monetary remedies imposed in the Related Consumer Action because of the

civil money penalty paid in this action or because of any payment that the
Bureau makes from the Civil Penalty Fund. If the court in any Related
Consumer Action offsets or otherwise reduces the amount of compensatory
monetary remedies imposed against Respondent based on the civil money
penalty paid in this action or based on any payment that the Bureau makes
from the Civil Penalty Fund, Respondent must, within 30 days after entry of
a final order granting such offset or reduction, notify the Bureau, and pay the
amount of the offset or reduction to the U.S. Treasury. Such a payment will
not be considered an additional civil money penalty and will not change the
amount of the civil money penalty imposed in this action.

IX.

Additional Monetary Provisions

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that:
In the event of any default on Respondentâs obligations to make payment
under this Consent Order, interest, computed under 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1961, as
amended, will accrue on any outstanding amounts not paid from the date of
default to the date of payment, and will immediately become due and

payable.

Respondent must relinquish all dominion, control, and title to the funds paid
to the fullest extent permitted by law and no part of the funds may be

Under 31 U.S.C. Â§ 7701, Respondent, unless it already has done so, must
furnish to the Bureau its taxpayer-identification numbers, which may be
used for purposes of collecting and reporting on any delinquent amount
arising out of this Consent Order.

in a Related Consumer Action, Respondent must notify the Regional
Director of the final judgment, consent order, or settlement in writing. That
