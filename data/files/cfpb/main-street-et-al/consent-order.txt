IV
Bureau Findings and Conclusions

The Bureau finds the following:

8.

10.

Respondents own and operate 156 stores in eight states (Alabama, Louisiana,
Michigan, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia).
Main Street is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in
Cleveland, Tennessee. Main Street operates storefront lending operations
through subsidiaries.

Respondent ACAC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Main Street and is also
headquartered in Cleveland, Tennessee. It does business under the names

âApproved Cash Advanceâ and âQuik Lend.â It offers payday loans, title loans,

17.

and check cashing in retail centers in Alabama, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi,
Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia.

Respondent Quik Lend is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Main Street and is also
headquartered in Cleveland, Tennessee. It offers payday loans and title loans to
consumers. Quik Lend operates in retail centers in Mississippi and Tennessee.
Respondents share the same management, Board of Directors, headquarters, and
office space. In addition, ACAC and Quik Lend channel revenue to Main Street.
Respondents, through the operating entities, provide, service, and collect on
payday, title, and installment loans offered to consumers primarily for personal,
family, or household purposes. These are âconsumer financial product[s] or
service[s]â under the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(5), (15)(A)(i).

Respondents are covered persons under the CFPA because they make, service,
and collect upon consumer loans. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(6), (15)(A)(), (15) (A) (x).
Respondents are âcreditorsâ under TILA and Regulation Z because they regularly
extend credit for personal, family, or household purposes that is subject to a
finance charge and is initially payable to them. 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1602(g); 12 C.F.R. Â§
1026.2(a)(17).

The auto-title pledge loans offered by Respondents in Mississippi constitute
closed-end credit. 12 C.F.R Â§ 1026.2(a)(10).

Respondents have operated as a common enterprise that shares common
ownership, management, Board of Directors, addresses, headquarters, office

space, and employees, and commingles funds.

Respondents have operated asa common enterprise while engaging in the
conduct described herein.
Because Respondents have operated as a common enterprise, each of them is

jointly and severally liable for the acts or practices alleged.

Respondentsâ Mississippi Auto-Title Pledge Product and Disclosures

Respondents offer auto-title loans to consumers in their Mississippi stores, which
are regulated under the Mississippi Title Pledge Act. Miss. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 75-67-
401 et seq.

Under Mississippi law, auto-title loans must be structured asa single-payment
transaction with a 30-day maturity date.

Mississippi law permits the parties to agree in writing to subsequent extensions
at 30-day intervals if the lender reduces the principal amount used to calculate
the finance charges by at least 10% of the original amount at each 30-day
extension. The full principal amount itself is still owed, but the finance charges
on that amount must be reduced.

Between October 2016 and August 2018, Respondents offered auto-title loans
which disclosed the finance charges, pursuant to TILA, based on a single-
payment transaction with a 30-day maturity date. Respondents also provided
consumers with a separate document entitled the âAmortization Schedule.â The
total of payments disclosed under TILA was substantially less than the amount
consumers would pay if they paid according to the 10-month Amortization
Schedule, and it was substantially less than the amount actually paid by most of

Respondentsâ consumers. Most consumers paid on their auto-title pledge
24.

25.

26.

27,

28.

transactions for longer than the 30-day period set forth in the TILA disclosures,
and thus paid more than the disclosed finance charge.

Respondents presented the Title Pledge Agreement Transaction Form containing
the 30-day finance charge and the Amortization Schedule showing 10 monthly
payments together to consumers.

Consumers were required to sign the Title Pledge Agreement Transaction Form,
which contained the principal amount of the loan and the âtitle pledge service
chargeâ for a single-payment transaction. These same terms were included in the
TILA disclosure asthe Amount Financed and the Finance Charge.

Respondents also required consumers to sign the Amortization Schedule. This
was the presumptive payment schedule for consumers under the contract.

A consumer who paid the 10 equal payments reflected on the Amortization
Schedule would ultimately pay significantly higher finance charges than the
finance charge that appeared in the TILA disclosure section of the Title Pledge
Agreement Transaction Form.

For example, on April 24, 2018, Respondents made a $500 loan to a consumer.
The Title Pledge Agreement Transaction Form listed the amount financed as
$500, the finance charge as $119.50, and the total amount the consumer would
have paid after making all scheduled payments as $619.50. The number of
payments was listed as â1â and the due date listed as May 24, 2018, 30 days later.
The APR was listed as 290.78%. The consumer was required to sign this form. An
example of the Title Pledge Agreement Transaction Form is provided below as

Exhibit A.
29.

30.

31,

32,

33:

34.

The consumerâs total payments under the Amortization Schedule would be
$1,157.20, far more than the $619.50 disclosed in the TILA disclosure section of
the Title Pledge Agreement Transaction Form. An example of the Amortization
Schedule is provided below as Exhibit B.
Instead of paying $119.50 in finance charges as disclosed, the consumer would
have paid $657.20 in finance charges, the total of the monthly âfeeâ column in
this schedule when the consumer made payments in the scheduled amount each
month and did not redeem her title earlier.
Respondentsâ contracts and disclosures did not plainly indicate to consumers that
the finance charge and total amount paid under the 10-month Amortization
Schedule would be higher than those paid under the single-payment schedule.
From October 2016 through August 2018, Respondents provided documents
containing inaccurate TILA disclosures to their Mississippi title-loan consumers.
Misrepresentations of Finance Charges in Violation of the CFPA
Section 1036(a)(1)(B) of the CFPA prohibits deceptive acts or practices. 12 U.S.C.
Â§ 5536(a)(1)(B).
As described in Paragraphs 20 to 32, when originating auto-title pledges in
Mississippi, Respondents disclosed to consumers, in the Title Pledge Transaction
Agreement Form, finance charges substantially lower than the consumers would
incur for their auto-title loans if they repaid them according to the Amortization

Schedules that Respondents also provided.
35:

36.

4O.

41.

Respondentsâ representations regarding finance charges were material because
they relate to the cost of the loan and would therefore likely affect the consumersâ
conduct or decision regarding the loan.
Respondentsâ representations were likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably
under the circumstances. Consumers acting reasonably likely would not
understand that the Finance Charge and Total of Payments disclosed in the Title
Loan Agreement did not actually represent the amounts they would pay if they
paid according to the Amortization Schedule.
Respondentsâ representations set forth above were false or misleading and
constitute deceptive acts or practices in violation of the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. 8Â§ 5531,
5536(a)(1)(B).

Understating of Finance Charges in Violation of TILA
Regulation Z implements TILA, 15 U.S.C. Â§8 1601â1666f, and is intended, among
other things, âto promote the informed use of consumer credit by requiring
disclosures about its terms and cost.â 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.1.
Disclosures required by Regulation Z must be made âclearly and conspicuouslyâ
in writing and must reflect âthe terms of the legal obligation between the parties.â
12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.17(a)(1), (c)(1).
Among other things, a creditor must disclose the âfinance chargeâ in a closed-end
credit transaction pursuant to TILA and Regulation Z. 15 U.S.C. 88 1631(b),
1638(a)(3); 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.18(d).
Regulation Z defines âfinance chargeâ as âthe cost of consumer credit asa dollar

amount.â The finance charge âincludes any charge payable directly or indirectly
42.

43.

44.

45.

46.

by the consumer and imposed directly or indirectly by the creditor as an incident
to or a condition of the extension of credit.â 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.4(a).

As described in Paragraphs 20 to 32 Respondents understated the finance charge
in its Mississippi auto-title pledge transactions. Respondentsâ failure to disclose a
finance charge that reflected the terms of the legal obligation between the parties,
which the Bureau found to be the Amortization Schedule, to a credit transaction
violated TILA and Regulation Z. 15 U.S.C. 88 1631(b), 1638(a)(3); 12 C.F.R.

Â§Â§ 1026.17(c)(1), 1026.18(d).

Respondentsâ Failure to Refund Consumersâ Credit Balances
Between October 2014 and November 2015, consumers sometimes made
overpayments to Respondents â that is, they may have inadvertently paid
Respondents more than they owed.

When they received overpayments from consumers, Respondents in many
instances retained them without contacting the consumers or issuing refunds for
extended periods, sometimes more than six months and in certain instances for
years.

While Respondents began refunding consumers these amounts in November

2015, they did not complete that process until November 2017.

Violations of the CFPA Related to Failure to Refund Credit Balances

An act or practice is unfair under the CFPA if it causes or is likely to cause
substantial injury to consumers, if the injury is not reasonably avoidable, and if
the injury is not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or to

competition. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5531(c).

Respondents injured consumers by keeping hundreds of consumersâ
overpayments, ranging from a few dollars to more than $500.

These injuries were not reasonably avoidable. Consumers were unaware that
Respondents would retain overpayments and most likely were unaware that they
had a credit balance with Respondents.

Finally, the injury is not outweighed by any countervailing benefits to consumers
or to competition. Respondentsâ failure to refund consumers provided no benefit
to consumers or to competition.

Respondentsâ failure to refund consumers credit balances was unfair, in violation
of the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. 88 5531, 5536(a)(1)(B).

Violations of TILA Related to Failure to Refund Credit Balances

TILA and Regulation Z require that, when a credit balance in excess of $1 is
created on a credit account, the creditor must â[m Jake a good faith effort to
refund the consumer. .. any part of the credit balance remaining in the account
for more than 6 months.â 12 C.F.R. 81026.21(c).

Respondentsâ failure to refund consumersâ credit balances in excess of $1 that had
been outstanding for more than six monthsis a violation of TILA and Regulation

Z. 12 C.F.R. 81026.21(c).

Respondentsâ Collection Calls to Consumersâ Workplaces and to References

53:

From October 2016 through at least January 2017, Respondents routinely called
consumers at work or called their references in an attempt to collect debts.
Sometimes Respondents called consumers on shared lines, and in the process,

spoke with consumersâ co-workers or employers. When Respondents spoke with

these third-parties, Respondents disclosed or risked disclosing the existence of
consumersâ debt.

Respondentsâ written company policy did not specifically limit calls to third
parties to circumstances where they could not reach the borrowers.

Respondentsâ written policy permitted daily calls to workplaces and references.
In practice, Respondentsâ often called consumersâ workplaces and references
twice daily.

Respondentsâ supervisors instructed employees to keep calling workplaces and
references until they spoke to someone.

Respondentsâ employees routinely called workplaces and references even when
they had accurate direct contact information for borrowers.

Respondentsâ employees received written warnings from company supervisors
for not calling workplaces and references enough.

When calling third parties, Respondentsâ employees in many instances disclosed
or risked disclosing the delinquency of consumersâ debts.

Respondentsâ employees also routinely called third parties, including consumersâ
workplaces and references, after they had been asked to stop calling these phone
numbers.

Respondents made numerous calls to workplaces when (a) Respondents knew or
should have known that such calls were prohibited or (b) Respondents knew or
should have known that the consumers, their colleagues, or employers had

previously requested that the calls to work cease.

When calling workplaces, references or other third parties in its collection efforts,
Respondentsâ employees in many instances disclosed or risked disclosing the
delinquency of consumersâ debts.
Consumers suffered or were likely to suffer harm asa result of these collection
callpractices, including humiliation, reputational damage, and negative
consequences at work.

Violations of the CFPA Related to Collection Calls
Respondentsâ repeated calls to third parties have caused and were likely to cause
consumers substantial injury, including humiliation, inconvenience, and
reputational damage ranging from unwanted attention, to disclosure of their
delinquent debt to references or colleagues, to disciplinary action and other
negative employment consequences at work.
Consumers could not reasonably avoid the harm because they did not know
whether, when, or how these calls might occur and had no control over
Respondentsâ use of these collection tactics. In numerous instances, Respondents
continued to call consumers references and at work even after consumers,
references, or their employers asked Respondents to stop. This injury was not
outweighed by any countervailing benefits to consumers or competition.
Respondentsâ repeated calls to consumersâ workplaces and references were made
without regard to whether Respondents could reach consumers directly and in
many instances after consumers had requested that Respondents cease

attempting to contact them.

Respondents, for all purposes, must treat the civil money penalty paid under this
Consent Order as a penalty paid to the government. Regardless of how the
Bureau ultimately uses those funds, Respondents may not:
a. claim, assert, or apply for a tax deduction, tax credit, or any other tax
