Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Settles with SMART Payment Plan, LLC for
Deceptive Sales Practices

NOV 02, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. â Today the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) issued a
consent order against SMART Payment Plan, LLC (SMART), finding that the companyâs
disclosures of its loan payment program contained misleading statements in violation of the
Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010's prohibition against deceptive acts or practices.
SMART is a limited liability company with its principal place of business in Austin, Texas.
SMART operates a loan payment program for auto loans called the SMART Plan that
deducts payments from consumersâ bank accounts every two weeks and then forwards
these payments every month to the consumersâ lenders. The consent order imposes a
judgment against SMART requiring it to pay $7,500,000 in consumer redress and
requirements to prevent future violations.

SMART provided consumers individualized âbenefits summariesâ that purported to state a
specific amount of interest savings or other money savings consumers would get by
enrolling in the SMART Plan, but SMARTâs fees would ordinarily exceed the savings.
SMART's disclosures thus created the misleading impression that consumers would save
money using its product.

The ordered redress amount is suspended upon SMARTâs payment of $1,500,000 by
December 31, 2020 and a $1 civil money penalty to the Bureau. The suspension of the full
payment for redress, as well as the $1 civil penalty, is based on SMARTâs demonstrated
inability to pay more based on sworn financial statements. Harmed consumers may be
eligible for additional relief from the Bureauâs Civil Penalty Fund. The consent order
prohibits SMART from making any misrepresentations about its payment programs. It also
requires SMART to account for the total costs for its payment programs, as well as the net
savings or costs after deducting any fees, whenever SMART makes claims about savings or
financial benefits.
