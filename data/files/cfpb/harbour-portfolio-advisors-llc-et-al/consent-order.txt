Bureau Findings and Conclusions

The Bureau finds the following:
Harbour is a Texas limited-liability company that formerly entered into
contracts for deed with consumers. Harbour has now ceased operations

and is in the process of dissolution. Under the terms of these contracts,
AAAS Per AAR A am -. Lo peer PAR PRR AMA PA â gc ya

consumers are obligated to pay a fixed principal over a term of years with
an interest rate. These contracts therefore constitute âcreditâ under

Â§ 5481(7) of the CFPA. Harbour is therefore a âcovered personâ under

the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(5)(A), (6)(A), (7), (15)(A)G).

NAA was a South Carolina limited-liability company that dissolved in 2018.
NAM is a South Carolina limited-liability company.

NAA advertised available homes for sale and serviced and maintained the
subject properties on behalf of Harbour. NAM arranged for consumers to
enter into contracts for deed with Harbour. NAM served as the primary
conduit for consumer communications as well as the delivery of
information to consumer-reporting agencies. During the last several years of
Harbourâs operations, NAM was responsible for fielding consumer
inquiries and disputes and for the reporting of information to consumer-
reporting agencies regarding consumer inquiries and disputes.

NAA and NAM therefore serviced the contracts provided by Harbour and
are thus âcovered personsâ under the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(5)(A),
(6)(A), (7), 15 )(A)(@).

By furnishing information about the contracts to a consumer-reporting

agency, NAM is a âfurnisherâ under Regulation V. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1022.41.
10.

11.

14.

Findings and Conclusions as to Deceptive Acts or Practices
Regarding Credit Reporting

Beginning in 2010 until at least 2016, Harbourâs business plan was to
acquire foreclosed properties in bulk, at auction, from entities such as Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac, and resell them to private individuals through cash
sales, bank financing, and primarily through seller financing in the form of
contracts for deed. NAA and NAM acted as Harbourâs agents during the
sales, origination, and servicing process.

NAM furnished information about consumersâ payment histories to a
consumer-reporting agency.

Between at least 2012 and 2016, when consumers called NAA or NAM to
complain about errors on their consumer reports relating to their transactions
with Harbour, they told some consumers that the only way for a consumer to
get help was to file a dispute with the consumer-reporting agency.

When a furnisher represents to a consumer that the only way for

consumers to initiate credit disputes is by filing a dispute with a
consumer-reporting agency, such representation is inaccurate as a

matter of law.

Instead, Regulation V requires furnishers of credit information to investigate
written disputes it may receive and to contact the applicable consumer-

reporting agency in order to resolve any found errors. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1022.43.

Also, furnishers of credit information may investigate a consumer-initiated

dispute based solely on a consumerâs phone call.

When consumers are provided inaccurate information about how they can
initiate credit inquiries or disputes, their rights may be impeded in their
efforts to ensure that their consumer reports are accurate. The added hurdle
of filing a dispute with the consumer-reporting agency could slow the
process, leaving the consumer with an inaccurate report for a longer time.
In some cases, adding additional burdens on the consumers could
discourage consumers from making efforts to try to initiate disputes in the

first place.

An act or practice is deceptive if it involves a material misrepresentation or
omission that is likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under the
circumstances.

Information that is material to consumers is information that is likely to
affect a consumerâs conduct regarding the product or service. Express
claims are presumptively material.

The information provided to Harbourâs consumers described above is
material because it was express and because it would likely affect a
consumerâs conduct regarding how to go about getting consumer-

reporting errors resolved.
20. Therefore, Respondents engaged in deceptive acts and practices in violation

of the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(B).

Findings and Conclusions as to Violations of Regulation V and FCRA
for Failing to Establish and Implement Required Policies and Procedures

21. Regulation V requires furnishers to âestablish and implement reasonable
written policies and procedures regarding the accuracy and integrity of the
information relating to consumers that it furnishes to a consumer reporting
agency.â 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1022.42(a).

22. The policies and procedures must be appropriate to the nature, size,
complexity, and scope of the furnisherâs activities and must consider the
guidelines contained in Appendix E of the Furnisher Rule. 12 C.F.R. Â§
1022.42(a)-(b).

23. | Appendix E includes guidance to: (1) establish and implement internal
controls to ensure the accuracy and integrity of information furnished to
consumer-reporting agencies about consumers; (2) train staff that furnish
information; (3) provide appropriate and effective oversight of service
providers; (4) delete, update, and correct information in the furnisherâs
records, as appropriate, to avoid furnishing inaccurate information; (5)
design appropriate technology to communicate with consumer-reporting
agencies; and (6) conduct a periodic evaluation of its policies and

procedures. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1022, Appendix E.
24.

25.

26.

27.

28.

Appendix E also directs furnishers to consider âfeedback received from
consumer reporting agencies, consumers, or other appropriate parties.â 12
C.F.R. Â§ 1022, Appendix E.

NAM has a Quality Control Manual, which contains a section relating to
consumer reporting (the Policy).

In large part, the Policy summarizes some of FCRA and Regulation Vâs
requirements, and states that NAMâs servicing manager will conduct
âroutine FDCPA and FCRA refreshers and seminars.â The Policy does not
delineate any specific guidance for complying with FCRA or Regulation V,
nor does it lay out any processes regarding the accuracy and integrity of
information furnished to consumer-reporting agencies other than stating the

person to whom employees should address questions.

NAM did not provide adequate training for its staff. Consequently,
consumers were, at times, misled about how to resolve consumer-

reporting errors. NAM also did not update their policies and procedures in
response to the consumer complaintsâfeedback from consumers

discussed in Appendix Eâthat should have put NAM on notice that its
credit reporting may have been inaccurate.

NAM therefore violated Regulation V by failing to establish and implement

the required reasonable written policies and procedures. 12 C.F.R.

binding on the Bureau.

Within 10 days of the Effective Date, Harbour must pay the

applicable civil money penalty by wire transfer to the Bureau or to the
Bureauâs agent in compliance with the Bureauâs wiring instructions.

Within 10 days of the Effective Date or by July 3, 2020, whichever is

later, NAA or NAM must pay the applicable civil money penalty by

wire transfer to the Bureau or to the Bureauâs agent in compliance

with the Bureauâs wiring instructions.

Each civil money penalty paid under this Consent Order will be deposited in
the Civil Penalty Fund of the Bureau as required by Â§ 1017(d) of the CFPA,
12 U.S.C. Â§ 5497(d).

Each Respondent, for all purposes, must treat any civil money penalty paid
under this Consent Order as a penalty paid to the government. Regardless of
how the Bureau ultimately uses those funds, Respondents may not:

a. claim, assert, or apply for a tax deduction, tax credit, or any other tax

benefit for any civil money penalty paid under this Consent Order; or

b. seek or accept, directly or indirectly, reimbursement or indemnification
from any source, including but not limited to payment made under any

To preserve the deterrent effect of the civil money penalty in any Related
Consumer Action, Respondents may not argue that Respondents are entitled
to, nor may Respondents benefit by, any offset or reduction of any
compensatory monetary remedies imposed in the Related Consumer Action
because of the civil money penalty paid in this action or because of any
payment that the Bureau makes from the Civil Penalty Fund. If the court in
any Related Consumer Action offsets or otherwise reduces the amount of
compensatory monetary remedies imposed against a Respondent based on
the civil money penalty paid in this action or based on any payment that the
Bureau makes from the Civil Penalty Fund, that Respondent must, within 30
days after entry of a final order granting such offset or reduction, notify the
Bureau, and pay the amount of the offset or reduction to the U.S. Treasury.
Such a payment will not be considered an additional civil money penalty and
will not change the amount of the civil money penalty imposed in this

action.

In the event of any default on any Respondentâs obligation to make
payment under this Consent Order, interest, computed under 28
U.S.C. Â§ 1961, as amended, will accrue on any outstanding amounts
not paid from the date of default to the date of payment and will

immediately become due and payable.

Respondents must relinquish all dominion, control, and title to the funds
paid to the fullest extent permitted by law and no part of the funds may be
returned to Respondents.

must furnish to the Bureau its taxpayer-identifying numbers, which may be
used for purposes of collecting and reporting on any delinquent amount
arising out of this Consent Order.

Within 30 days of the entry of a final judgment, consent order, or settlement
in a Related Consumer Action, every Respondent to this Consent Order that
was party to the Related Consumer Action must notify the Enforcement
Director of the final judgment, consent order, or settlement in writing. That
notification must indicate the amount of redress, if any, that Respondent paid
or is required to pay to consumers and describe the consumers or classes of

consumers to whom that redress has been or will be paid.

Respondent.

The Bureau releases and discharges Respondents from all potential liability
for law violations that the Bureau has or might have asserted based on the
practices described in Section IV of this Consent Order, to the extent such
practices occurred before the Effective Date and the Bureau knows about
them as of the Effective Date. The Bureau may use the practices described in
this Consent Order in future enforcement actions against any Respondent

and its affiliates, including, without limitation, to establish a pattern or

practice of violations or the continuation of a pattern or practice of violations

or to calculate the amount of any penalty. This release does not preclude or
affect any right of the Bureau to determine and ensure compliance with the
Consent Order, or to seek penalties for any violations of the Consent Order.
This Consent Order is intended to be, and will be construed as, a final
Consent Order issued under Â§ 1053 of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5563, and
expressly does not form, and may not be construed to form, a contract
