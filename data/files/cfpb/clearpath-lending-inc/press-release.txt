Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Settles with Eighth Mortgage Company to
Address Deceptive Loan Advertisements Sent to Servicemembers and Veterans

SEP 14, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) issued a
consent order against ClearPath Lending, Inc. (ClearPath), a California corporation that is
licensed as a mortgage broker or lender in about 22 states. ClearPath offers and provides
mortgage loans guaranteed by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).
ClearPathâs principal means of advertising VA-guaranteed loans is through direct-mail
advertisements sent primarily to United States military servicemembers and veterans. The
Bureau found that ClearPath sent consumers mailers for VA-guaranteed mortgages that
contained false, misleading, and inaccurate statements or that lacked required disclosures,
in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Actâs (CFPA) prohibition against deceptive
acts and practices, the Mortgage Acts and PracticesâAdvertising Rule (MAP Rule), and
Regulation Z. The consent order requires ClearPath to pay a civil money penalty and
imposes requirements to prevent future violations.

Today's action is the eighth case stemming from a Bureau sweep of investigations of
multiple mortgage companies that use deceptive mailers to advertise VA-guaranteed
mortgages. The Bureau commenced this sweep in response to concerns about potentially
unlawful advertising in the market that the VA identified. This ongoing sweep of
investigations reflects the Bureauâs commitment to enforcing the laws that ensure the
financial marketplace is fair and accurate for all consumers, including servicemembers,
veterans, and surviving spouses whom VA-guaranteed mortgages are designed to benefit.

The Bureau found that ClearPath disseminated advertisements that contained false,
misleading, and inaccurate statements or that failed to include required disclosures. For
example, ClearPath advertisements misrepresented the credit terms of the advertised
mortgage loan by stating credit terms that the company was not actually prepared to offer
to the consumer, including misrepresenting the annual percentage rate applicable to the
advertised mortgage. ClearPath also misleadingly advertised rates or payments as fixed,
even though the advertised mortgage was an adjustable-rate mortgage or the payment was
not fixed for the indicated duration. ClearPath also misrepresented the existence, nature, or
amount of cash or credit available to the consumer, and the existence or amount of fees or
costs to the consumer, in connection with the advertised mortgage. The Bureau also found
that ClearPath advertisements created the false impression that ClearPath was affiliated with
the VA. ClearPath advertisements also failed to properly disclose, when required by
Regulation Z, credit terms for the advertised mortgage, such as the number and time period
of payments associated with the consumer's repayment obligations over the full term of the
loan. Finally, the Bureau found that ClearPath advertisements used the name of the
consumer's lender in a misleading way by not adequately disclosing ClearPathâs name and
the fact that it was not associated with, or acting on behalf of, the consumer's current lender,
as required by Regulation Z.

The consent order against ClearPath requires ClearPath to pay a civil penalty of $625,000.
The consent order also imposes injunctive relief to prevent future violations, including
requiring ClearPath to bolster its compliance functions by designating an advertising
compliance official who must review its mortgage advertisements for compliance with
mortgage advertising laws prior to their use; prohibiting misrepresentations similar to those
identified by the Bureau; and requiring ClearPath to comply with certain enhanced
disclosure requirements to prevent future misrepresentations.
