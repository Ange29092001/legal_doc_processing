Overview
ClearPath is a mortgage broker and lender that offers and provides
mortgages guaranteed by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs
(VA). Occasionally, it has acted as the creditor, providing loans itself; in
other situations, it has acted as a broker, arranging for another creditor to
provide loans.
ClearPath advertises these mortgage products to consumers through direct-
mail advertising campaigns targeted primarily at United States military
servicemembers and veterans.
ClearPath has sent consumers millions of advertisements that violate federal
law because of misleading and deceptive statements and inadequate
disclosures.
The Bureau brings this action to stop ClearPath from distributing
advertisements with misleading and deceptive statements and inadequate
disclosures to servicemembers, veterans, and other consumers.

Bureau Findings and Conclusions

The Bureau finds the following:

ClearPath is a California corporation with its principal place of business in
Irvine, California.

ClearPath is licensed as a mortgage broker or lender in about 22 states.
ClearPath is a âperson,â as defined in the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(19),
Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.2(a)(22), and the MAP Rule, 12 C.F.R. Â§
1014.2, because it is a corporation.

During the Relevant Period, ClearPath has been a âcovered personâ under
the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(6)(A), because it is a person that engages in

offering and providing residential-mortgage loans, which are âconsumer

financial product[s] or service[s]â under the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(5), (6),
(15)(A)Q@).

During the Relevant Period, ClearPath has been subject to the MAP Rule
because it is a person over which the Federal Trade Commission has
jurisdiction under the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 41-58.
12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.1. The MAP Rule is a Federal consumer financial law. 12
U.S.C. Â§ 548114).

ClearPath provides âmortgage credit product|[s],â as that term is defined in
the MAP Rule. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.2.

ClearPathâs mortgage advertisements are âcommercial communicationsâ
regarding a term of a âmortgage credit product,â as those terms are defined
in 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1014.2.

During the Relevant Period, ClearPath has offered âââclosed-end creditâ in the
form of mortgage loans to âconsumers,â as those terms are defined in
Regulation Z. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.2(a)(10) & (11).

ClearPathâs mortgage advertisements are advertisements for âclosed-end
credit,â as that term is defined in Regulation Z. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.2(a)(10).
ClearPath offers consumer mortgages, including mortgages guaranteed by

the VA.

ClearPathâs principal means of advertising VA-guaranteed mortgages is
through direct-mail advertisements sent to veterans and servicemembers.
Since July 2017, ClearPath has mailed millions of mortgage advertisements
to veterans and servicemembers in at least 22 states.

Hundreds of thousands of consumers have received at least one of
ClearPathâs direct-mail advertisements, and thousands of consumers have

obtained mortgages through ClearPath.

False, Misleading, and Inaccurate Representations

Federal consumer financial law contains numerous provisions banning the
use of misleading and deceptive statements in mortgage advertisements.
Despite those prohibitions, ClearPath was responsible for both the content
of, and the dissemination of, numerous mortgage advertisements during the
Relevant Period that contained false, misleading, and inaccurate statements,
as described below.

False, Misleading, and Inaccurate
Representations About Cost and Other Credit Terms

Most of ClearPathâs mortgage advertisements stated specific credit terms,
such as an interest rate, annual percentage rate (APR), a payment amount, or

closing costs.

By stating specific credit terms in its advertisements, ClearPath represented,
expressly or by implication, that it arranged or offered a mortgage with those
credit terms.

In fact, ClearPath did not arrange or offer mortgages with the specific credit
terms stated in many of those advertisements.

In numerous instances, ClearPath misrepresented the actual credit terms
applicable to the mortgages that it would arrange or offer.

Numerous ClearPath mortgage advertisements described mortgages with a
simple interest rate and APR combination that, on the date of the
advertisement, ClearPath was not actually prepared to offer or arrange.

For example, ClearPath advertisements sent to around 260,000 consumers in
November and December 2017 advertised a variable-rate mortgage with a
fixed interest of 2.25% for the first three years and an APR of 3.17%.

In fact, the advertised APR was not correct because it did not take into
account a reasonably current index for the variable-rate period and required
discount points.

The actual APR for this loan, calculated in accordance with Regulation Z
and taking into account a reasonably current index and required discount

points, was at least 3.516%.

Accordingly, ClearPath misrepresented the actual APR for loans offered in
these advertisements.

Numerous ClearPath mortgage advertisements misrepresented the existence
and amount of fees or costs to the consumer.

In another example, ClearPath advertisements sent to around 80,600
consumers in July 2017 stated âNO Lender Feesâ in bold font in a box titled
âClosing Costs,â along with an advertised APR of 3.17%.

In fact, consumers could not obtain a loan from ClearPath with an APR of
3.17% without paying two discount points at closing. Therefore, the
statement âNO Lender Feesâ was false.

Certain ClearPath mortgage advertisements misleadingly advertised rates or
payments as âfixedâ rates or payments, although the mortgage advertised
was an adjustable-rate or variable-rate mortgage.

For example, ClearPath advertisements sent to consumers in or around
January 2018 used the phrase â30 Year Loan /3 Year Fixedâ next to the
advertised payment on the front. In these advertisements, the phrase
âAdjustable-Rate Mortgage,â âVariable-Rate Mortgage,â or âARMâ did not
appear before the first use of the word âfixed,â nor was it at least as

conspicuous as any use of the word âfixedâ in the advertisements.

In these advertisements, despite stating in fine print on the reverse side that
the offer was for an ââadjustable-rate mortgage,â the use of the word âfixedâ
to refer to a rate or payment was not accompanied by an equally prominent
and closely proximate statement of the fact that the rate may vary or the
payment may increase after the first three years.

In another example, ClearPath advertisements sent to consumers in or
around January 2018 contained a box on the top portion of the advertisement
that stated an amount described as âPayment for Next 12 Monthsâ and
directly below that box, another box that stated â30 year Fixedâ in bold font.
The phrase â30 year Fixedâ referred to that stated payment amount.

In fact, the payment amount disclosed was not the same for 30 years. The
payment amount for the first 12 months included a discounted principal and
interest payment plus taxes and insurance and the payment amount for the
remaining 348 months would include full principal and interest plus taxes
and insurance.

In these advertisements, the phrase â30 year Fixedâ was not accompanied by
an equally prominent and closely proximate statement of the fact that the
payment would increase to a higher fixed amount after the first 12 months.
Numerous ClearPath mortgage advertisements misrepresented the existence,

nature, or amount of cash or credit available to the consumer in connection

with the mortgage.

Specifically, ClearPath advertisements sent to around 80,600 consumers in
July 2017, advertised both a âVA Streamlineâ mortgage (also known as an
Interest Rate Reduction Refinance Loan) and a âCash-Outâ refinance
mortgage. The advertisements stated, âNo Equity Required.â The
positioning of that statement on these advertisements implied that it applied

to both of the advertised products, as shown below.

The âNo Equity Requiredâ representation was not accompanied by any
statement indicating that it did not apply to both products.

In fact, while equity in the property may not be required to obtain an Interest
Rate Reduction Refinance Loan, the consumer must have equity in the
property to obtain a cash-out refinance mortgage.

Consumers who received the advertisements described in Paragraphs 27â44
were likely to be misled by them.

The advertisements were also likely to affect consumersâ conduct or

decisions with regard to obtaining a loan.

Misrepresentations About an Affiliation with the Government
Numerous ClearPath mortgage advertisements falsely represented that the
sender of the advertisements and the provider of the mortgage product
described in the advertisements was, or was affiliated with, the VA. These
advertisements were written in the form of a notification letter addressed to
the consumer, informing the consumer of his entitlement to and eligibility
for certain VA loan benefitsânamely, the purported lower payment and rate
on a 30-year loan identified in the letter. The letter included the phrases
2017 â Eligibility Notificationâ and âBenefit Allotmentâ in its header, and
assigned a âVA Loan ID Numberâ to the consumerâs existing VA loan. The
letter stated that ClearPath had âimportant information regarding your VA
loan,â that ârecordsâ from the consumerâs city indicated that the consumer
had âyet to take advantage of programs sponsored by The Department of
Veterans Affairs,â and that the consumer was âentitled to a payment and rate
reduction through VA eligibility lending programs.â The letter further stated,
âIt is important you call our VA Loan Service Center toll free (866) 284-
9875 within 21 business days. By taking action now your next mortgage
payment may not be due until April 2018.â

The form of the communicationâa notification letterâand the phrases and

characteristics described in paragraph 47 implied that the sender of the letter

was the VA or an entity affiliated with the VA and that the purported lower
payment and rate listed in the letter were benefits or entitlements being
provided directly by the VA or an entity affiliated with the VA, for which
the consumer was being notified of his or her entitlement and eligibility.
Those representations were false because ClearPathâthe sender of the
advertisements and the provider of the mortgage product described in the
advertisementsâwas not affiliated with the VA or any other governmental
entity.
Consumers who received the advertisements described in Paragraphs 47â49
were likely to be misled by them.
The advertisements were also likely to affect consumersâ conduct or
decisions with regard to obtaining a loan.

Inadequate Disclosures
Most of ClearPathâs mortgage advertisements stated a period of repayment,
payment amount, or simple annual rate of interest. Under certain sections of
Regulation Z, including Â§ 1026.24(c), (d) and (f), the use of these terms
triggers specific disclosure requirements. Many of the advertisements did
not include the other disclosures that are required, or did not include them in

the manner required.

Numerous ClearPath mortgage advertisements stated a simple annual
interest rate more conspicuously than the APR.

Specifically, ClearPath advertisements described in paragraphs 28â31 stated
a simple annual rate of 2.25% in bold font, but the APR was stated below the
simple rate in a smaller font with weaker bolding.

Numerous ClearPath mortgage advertisements stated the period of
repayment or the amount of a payment, but did not state the number and
time period of payments associated with the consumerâs repayment
obligations over the full term of the loan.

Specifically, ClearPath advertisements for a variable-rate mortgage sent to
around 80,600 consumers in July 2017 stated a payment amount for the first
three years of the loan that was based on a discounted, introductory fixed
rate of 2.25%, but after the first three years, the payment amount would be
based on a variable rate that would adjust annually based on an index and
margin, with annual adjustments capped at 1% per year. While the payment
amount would likely be higher during the variable-rate period than in the
fixed-rate period, these advertisements did not state the number and time
period of payments for the variable-rate period.

Numerous ClearPath mortgage advertisements stated a simple annual rate of

interest for a loan for which more than one interest rate would apply, but:

(A) for variable-rate transactions, failed to state a rate determined by adding
an index and margin, based on a reasonably current index and margin; (B)
failed to clearly and conspicuously state the period during which each simple
annual rate of interest would apply; or (C) failed to state an accurate APR
for the loan because the stated APR was not based on a reasonably current
index, and thus, was not correctly calculated under Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R.
Â§Â§ 1026.17(c) and 1026.22.

For example, ClearPath advertisements for a variable-rate mortgage
described in Paragraph 56 stated a simple rate of interest but failed to
disclose the rate that would apply to the variable-rate period, as determined
by adding a reasonably current index and margin.

Moreover, because these advertisements disclosed an APR that was
calculated using an index that was not reasonably current, they failed to
disclose an APR that complied with the accuracy standards set forth in 12
C.F.R. Â§ 1026.22(a)(2) and (4).

Numerous ClearPath mortgage advertisements stated the amount of a
payment, but failed to state clearly and conspicuously the amount of each
payment that would apply over the term of the loan (e.g., for variable-rate
mortgages, payments based on the application of the sum of a reasonably

current index and margin); the period during which each payment would

apply; or the fact that the advertised payments did not include amounts for
taxes and insurance premiums, if applicable, and that the actual payment
obligation would be greater.

For example, ClearPath advertisements for a variable-rate mortgage
described in Paragraph 56 stated a payment amount based on an introductory
rate of 2.25% that would apply for the first three years, but for the variable-
rate period of the loan, did not disclose a payment amount based on a
reasonably current index and margin.

In another example, ClearPath advertisements sent to consumers in 2018
stated a monthly payment amount in large bold font on the front but did not
contain an equally prominent and closely proximate statement of the period
during which each payment amount would apply.

In another example, over 1.6 million ClearPath advertisements sent to
consumers from March 2018 to September 2019 failed to state, clearly and
conspicuously, that the payments did not include amounts for taxes and
insurance premiums, if applicable, and that the actual payment obligation
would be greater.

Numerous ClearPath mortgage advertisements used the name of the
consumerâs current lender without disclosing with equal prominence the

name of the person making the advertisement and without including a clear

and conspicuous statement that the person making the advertisement was not
associated with or acting on behalf of the consumerâs current lender.

For example, ClearPath advertisements sent to consumers in or around
January 2018 stated the name of the consumerâs current lender in bold font
on the upper left of the advertisement, and in bold and all caps on the
envelope. While ClearPathâs name appeared on the envelope and on the
front of the advertisements, it was in much smaller font than the current
lenderâs name. The advertisements also failed to include a clear and
conspicuous statement that the person making the advertisement was not
associated with or acting on behalf of the consumerâs current lender.

VIOLATIONS OF REGULATION Z
Unavailable Credit Terms, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(a)

Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(a), â[i]f an advertisement for credit states
specific credit terms, it shall state only those terms that actually are or will
be arranged or offered by the creditor.â

ClearPath violated Â§ 1026.24(a) because, as described in Paragraphs 23-44,
numerous ClearPath advertisements for credit stated specific credit terms
other than those terms that actually were or would be arranged or offered by

the creditor.

Interest Rates Other than the APR, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(c)

Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(c):
Ifan advertisement states a rate of finance charge, it shall state
the rate as an âannual percentage rate,â using that term. If the
annual percentage rate may be increased after consummation,
the advertisement shall state that fact.... If an advertisement
is for credit secured by a dwelling, the advertisement shall not
state any other rate [other than the APR], except that a simple
annual rate that is applied to an unpaid balance may be stated

in conjunction with, but not more conspicuously than, the
[APR].

ClearPath violated Â§ 1026.24(c) because, as described in Paragraphs 53â54,
numerous ClearPath mortgage advertisements stated a simple annual interest

rate more conspicuously than the APR.
Terms of Repayment, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(d)

Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(d)(1), if an advertisement sets forth any of the
four specified triggering terms (the amount or percentage of any
downpayment, the number of payments or period of repayment, the amount
of any payment, or the amount of any finance charge), the advertisement
must also state, among other things, â[t]he terms of repayment, which reflect

the repayment obligations over the full term of the loan, including any

balloon payment.â 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(d)(1), (2)ai).

ClearPath violated Â§ 1026.24(d) because, as described in Paragraphs 55â56,
numerous ClearPath mortgage advertisements set forth the period of
repayment or the amount of any payment, which are triggering terms under Â§
1026.24(d)(1)i1) and (111), but failed to state the repayment obligations over

the full term of the loan, pursuant to Â§ 1026.24(d)(2)(i1).
Inadequate Disclosure of Rates, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(f)(2)(i)

Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(f)(2)(1), if a direct-mail mortgage advertisement:

states a simple annual rate of interest and more than one
simple annual rate of interest will apply over the term of the
advertised loan, the advertisement shall disclose in a clear and
conspicuous manner:

(A) Each simple annual rate of interest that will apply.
In variable-rate transactions, a rate determined by
adding an index and margin shall be disclosed based on

a reasonably current index and margin;

(B) The period of time during which each simple
annual rate of interest will apply; and

(C) The [APR] for the loan. If such rate is variable, the

[APR] shall comply with the accuracy standards in
Â§Â§ 1026.17(c) and 1026.22.

ClearPath violated Â§ 1026.24(f)(2)(1) because, as described in Paragraphs
57-59, numerous ClearPath direct-mail mortgage advertisements for a loan
for which more than one interest rate would apply stated a simple annual rate

of interest, but did not include one or more of the disclosures required

74. Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(f)(3)(1), a direct-mail mortgage advertisement
that âstates the amount of any paymentâ must disclose, in a clear and
conspicuous manner:

(A) The amount of each payment that will apply over the term
of the loan, including any balloon payment. In variable-rate

disclosed based on a reasonably current index and margin;

(B) The period of time during which each payment will apply;
and

(C) In an advertisement for credit secured by a first lien on a
dwelling, the fact that the payments do not include amounts

for taxes and insurance premiums, if applicable, and that the
actual payment obligation will be greater.

75. ClearPath violated Â§ 1026.24(f)(3)() because, as described in Paragraphs
60â63, numerous ClearPath direct-mail mortgage advertisements stated the
amount of a payment but did not include one or more of the disclosures
required pursuant to Â§ 1026.24(f)(3)(i)(A) through (C), or did not disclose

Misleading Use of the Word âFixed,â 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(i)(1)

Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24()(1), mortgage advertisements may not:

Us[e] the word âfixedâ to refer to rates, payments, or the
credit transaction in an advertisement for variable-rate
transactions or other transactions where the payment will
increase, unless:

(i) In the case of an advertisement solely for one or more
variable-rate transactions,

(A) The phrase âAdjustable-Rate Mortgage,â
âVariable-Rate Mortgage,â or âARMâ appears in the
advertisement before the first use of the word âfixedâ
and is at least as conspicuous as any use of the word
âfixedâ in the advertisement; and

(B) Each use of the word âfixedâ to refer to a rate or
payment is accompanied by an equally prominent and
closely proximate statement of the time period for
which the rate or payment is fixed, and the fact that the
rate may vary or the payment may increase after that
period.

(ii) In the case of an advertisement solely for non-variable-
rate transactions where the payment will increase (e.g., a
stepped-rate mortgage transaction with an initial lower
payment), each use of the word âfixedâ to refer to the payment
is accompanied by an equally prominent and closely
proximate statement of the time period for which the payment
is fixed, and the fact that the payment will increase after that
period; or

(iii) In the case of an advertisement for both variable-rate
transactions and non-variable-rate transactions,

(A) The phrase âAdjustable-Rate Mortgage,â
âVariable-Rate Mortgage.â or âARMâ appears in the

advertisement with equal prominence as any use of the
term âfixed,â âFixed-Rate Mortgage,â or similar terms;
and

(B) Each use of the word âfixedâ to refer to a rate,
payment, or the credit transaction either refers solely to
the transactions for which rates are fixed and complies
with paragraph (1)(1)i) of this section, if applicable,
or, if it refers to the variable-rate transactions, is
accompanied by an equally prominent and closely
proximate statement of the time period for which the
rate or payment is fixed, and the fact that the rate may
vary or the payment may increase after that period.

77. ClearPath violated Â§ 1026.24(i)(1) because, as described in Paragraphs 35â
40, numerous ClearPath mortgage advertisements for variable-rate
transactions or other transactions where the payment will increase used the
word âfixedâ to refer to rates, payments, or the credit transaction and did not

comply with the requirements of Â§ 1026.24(1)(1)Q) through (iii).
Misleading Use of the Current Lenderâs Name, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(i)(4)

78. Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(1)(4), mortgage advertisements may not:

Us[e] the name of the consumerâs current lender in an
advertisement that is not sent by or on behalf of the
consumerâs current lender, unless the advertisement:

(1) Discloses with equal prominence the name of the
person or creditor making the advertisement; and

(ii) Includes a clear and conspicuous statement that

the person making the advertisement is not

ClearPath violated Â§ 1026.24(1)(4) because, as described in Paragraphs 64â

on behalf of the consumerâs current lender, used the name of the consumerâs
current lender and did not (1) disclose with equal prominence the name of
the person or creditor making the advertisement, as required by Â§
1026.24(1)(4)(1); or (2) include a clear and conspicuous statement that the

VIOLATIONS OF THE CFPA

Under the CFPA, it is unlawful for any covered person or service provider to
engage in a deceptive act or practice in connection with any transaction with
a consumer for a consumer-financial product or service, or the offering of a
consumer-financial product or service. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).
An act or practice is deceptive if it involves a material misrepresentation or
omission that is likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under the
circumstances.

Information that is likely to affect a consumerâs choice of, or conduct

regarding, a product or service is material to consumers.
Deceptive Representations About Credit Terms

In numerous instances, as described in Paragraphs 23-46, ClearPathâs
mortgage advertisements represented, expressly or by implication, that
specific credit terms were available or would be arranged or offered by the
creditor, including representations about specific APRs, the variable or fixed
nature of rates or payments, lender fees, and required equity, when in fact
those specific credit terms were not available or were not terms that

ClearPath was actually prepared to arrange or offer.

ClearPathâs misrepresentations about the availability of the advertised credit
terms of the advertised mortgage were likely to mislead consumers acting
reasonably under the circumstances.

ClearPathâs misrepresentations about the credit terms of the advertised
mortgage were material because they were likely to affect the conduct or
decisions of consumers.

Therefore, ClearPath engaged in deceptive acts and practices in violation of

the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).
Misrepresentations About Government Affiliation

In numerous instances, as described in Paragraphs 47-51, ClearPathâs
mortgage advertisements represented, expressly or by implication that
ClearPath was or was affiliated with the VA or that the advertisement was
sent by or on behalf of the VA.

In fact, ClearPath was not affiliated with the VA and the advertisements
were not sent by or on behalf of the VA.

ClearPathâs misrepresentations about government affiliation were likely to
mislead consumers acting reasonably under the circumstances.

benefit for any civil money penalty paid under this Consent Order; or
b. Seek or accept, directly or indirectly, reimbursement or

from the Civil Penalty Fund, Respondent must, within 30 days after entry of
a final order granting such offset or reduction, notify the Bureau, and pay the
amount of the offset or reduction to the U.S. Treasury. Such a payment will
not be considered an additional civil money penalty and will not change the
amount of the civil money penalty imposed in this action.
