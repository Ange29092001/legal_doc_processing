Case 8:20-cv-02132 Document1 Filed 11/05/20 Page 3of21 Page ID#:3

Barranca Parkway, Irvine, CA, 92618; and 2445 McCabe Way, Irvine, CA, 92614. At all
times material to this Complaint, PSLC has advertised, marketed, promoted, offered for
sale, sold, and provided financial advisory services in the form of debt-settlement
services, in particular student-loan debt-relief services, to consumers throughout the
United States.

7. Performance Settlement, LLC (âPSettlementâ), a California limited liability
company, maintains its principal place of business at 675 Anton Blvd, Costa Mesa, CA,
92626. At all times material to this Complaint, PSettlement advertised, marketed,
promoted, offered for sale, sold, or provided financial advisory services in the form of
debt-settlement services to consumers throughout the United States.

8. Daniel Crenshaw (âCrenshawââ) is the sole owner and CEO of PSLC, and is
the CEO and controlling owner of PSettlement. Crenshaw resides in Newport Beach,

California.
PSLCâs Business Practices

9. PSLC was a student-loan document-preparation and debt-relief service. It
prepared and submitted paperwork for consumers to the U.S. Department of Education
(âEDâ) in support of applications for loan consolidation, income-driven repayment plans,
forgiveness programs, and other debt-relief options available to consumers with federal
student loans. It also submitted recertification paperwork to ED for one or two years
after a consumerâs application for repayment programs was accepted.

10. ED does not charge federal student loan borrowers to submit applications to
participate in loan consolidation, income-driven repayment plans, forgiveness programs,
and other debt-relief programs or to submit recertification paperwork for those programs.

11. Formed in late 2015, PSLC solicited and signed up consumers nationwide

by telephone, using lead generators to transfer consumer phone calls to PSLCâs sales

staff.

Case 8:20-cv-02132 Document1 Filed 11/05/20 Page 4of21 Page ID #:4

12. PSLC collected a fee for its services in two ways: (1) by way of a loan
provided to PSLCâs customers by a third-party finance company, Equitable Acceptance
Corporation (âEACâ), and (2) by requiring its customers to make monthly installment
payments of the fee into trust accounts established for that purpose. Under both payment
methods, PSLC requested or received payment of its fee in advance of consumers making
any payments on loan consolidations or modifications that PSLC obtained for them.

13. The first way that PSLC charged its fee was through financing. From late
2015 through 2017, PSLC partnered with EAC, an indirect finance company that enters
into contracts with businesses to offer and provide credit to customers of those businesses

to pay for services.

14. Pursuant to an agreement with PSLC, EAC extended credit in the form of a
high-interest loan to many of PSLCâs customers, on a case-by-case basis, to pay for
PSLCâs services. For these customers, PSLCâs fee (not including the interest on the loan)
was $1,450.

15. During PSLCâs sales calls with a consumer to pitch enrollment in PSLCâs
program, the PSLC sales agent would request the $1,450 fee and offer the consumer a
loan from EAC to cover the fee if he or she met certain creditworthiness requirements.
PSLC used an electronic portal connected to EAC to enter the consumerâs financial
information and determine whether the consumer met EACâs requirements. If the
consumer agreed to the financing, the sales agent would electronically provide the
consumer with the PSLC contract and the EAC loan agreement (or cause EAC to provide
the loan agreement by means of the portal) and require the consumer to e-sign both
documents while on the call.

16. When they signed the EAC loan agreement, these consumers (âLoan
Customersâ) became obligated on the loan at the inception of their relationship with

PSLC.

Case 8:20-cv-02132 Document1 Filed 11/05/20 Page5of21 Page ID#:5

17. The EAC loan financed PSLCâs $1,450 service fee with an annual
percentage rate that was typically between 17% and 22% and a term of three years. The
effective interest rate was higher due to compounding. Thus, Loan Customers were
charged hundreds of dollars in addition to PSLCâs stated $1,450 fee.

18. Some Loan Customers were required to make a $200 cash deposit into a
trust account as a down payment on PSLCâs fee, and to finance the remaining $1,250.

19. EAC paid PSLC a portion of the $1,450 service fee within two weeks of a
Loan Customer signing the loan document at enrollment, holding a certain percentage
back in reserve depending on its assessment of the risk that the customer would default.
Typically, EACâs initial payment to PSLC was 40-60% of the $1,450 fee.

20. The EAC loan would appear on Loan Customersâ credit histories. After
signing the EAC loan agreement, Loan Customers were expected to make monthly
payments of principal and interest to EAC for three years, typically in the amount of $40
to $50 per month.

21. Some Loan Customers were confused about the loan payments to EAC,
believing that the money was going to pay their student debt and that at the end of the
three-year term of the loan, their student debt would be forgiven.

22. The second way PSLC charged its fee was by directing customers to pay by
monthly installments into a dedicated trust account with a third-party trust account
provider. The duration of the payment schedule and the amount of the monthly payment
varied, but these customers (âTrust Plan Customersâ) were generally charged a fee
ranging from $1,000 to $1,450.

23. PSLC required that Trust Plan Customers make the initial monthly payment
on the day of enrollment or within a few days of enrollment. Some Trust Plan Customers
chose a payment schedule consisting of larger installments paid monthly for a period less
than a year, while others chose a payment schedule of smaller installments paid monthly

for 12 to 18 months.

Case 8:20-cv-02132 Document1 Filed 11/05/20 Page 6of21 Page ID #:6

24. PSLC established trust accounts for its customers for no other purpose than
the payment of fees. In addition to making payments toward PSLCâs fee, Trust Plan
Customers also were required to pay a monthly banking fee of $6 to the third-party
administrator of the trust accounts. Some Trust Plan Customers paid additional amounts
in banking fees and fees to the third-party trust administrator, such as when a payment
was declined for insufficient funds. Trust Plan Customers paid at least $150,000 in such
additional charges.

25. PSLCâs practice has been to take the amounts accrued in a Trust Plan
Customerâs trust account after the consolidation or other loan modification was approved
by ED but before the Trust Plan Customer had made any payment under the
consolidation or loan modification.

26. PSLC did not provide Trust Plan Customers with any documentation that
included a disclosure informing those customers that they owned the funds in their trust
accounts and could withdraw them at any time without penalty.

27. PSLC terminated the relationship with EAC in late 2017. But as of February
2020, nearly 1,300 Loan Customers were still obligated on their loans to EAC.

28. From 2016 to 2019, PSLC enrolled more than 6,500 customers in multiple
states. From 2016 to late 2019, Trust Plan Customers paid more than $4,300,000 in fees
to PSLC. From 2016 to early 2020, Loan Customers paid more than $4,900,000 in loan
principal and interest to EAC.

29. PSLC ceased enrolling new consumers in 2019, although it continued to
collect fees from Trust Plan Customers in 2019 and 2020. PSLC ceased operations in
2020.

30. Crenshaw, as the sole owner and CEO of PSLC, participated in decisions,
policies, and practices relating to the manner and timing in which fees were charged to
and collected from both Loan Customers and Trust Plan Customers. Crenshaw was

responsible for the arrangement with EAC. He signed the contract with EAC and

Case 8:20-cv-02132 Document1 Filed 11/05/20 Page 7 of21 Page ID#:7

communicated directly with the top management of EAC concerning loans to Loan
Customers, payments from EAC to PSLC, and EACâs financing model. Crenshaw
provided the information for the application that initiated PSLCâs relationship with the
third-party trust administrator, which enabled the Trust Plan Customersâ accounts to be
established. He communicated directly with the manager of the trust administrator.

31. As the sole owner and CEO of PSLC, Crenshaw exercised control over the
company. He oversaw all managers at PSLC and participated in the companyâs day-to-
day business operations. He opened and was a signatory on the companyâs bank
accounts.

32. Crenshaw knew about or was recklessly indifferent to the manner and timing
in which fees were charged to customers. He knew or was recklessly indifferent to the
fact that Loan Customers became obligated at enrollment to pay EAC. He knew or was
recklessly indifferent to the fact that PSLC was requiring Trust Plan Customers to make
monthly fee payments into trust accounts beginning at or just after enrollment. He
reviewed payment reports and oversaw collections. Crenshaw reviewed customer
complaints that discussed the fees and the EAC loans.

33. In January 2016, at the very early stages of PSLCâs existence, PSLCâs legal
counsel warned Crenshaw about the timing of the companyâs fees. In an email to
Crenshaw, he stated: âthe consumer CANâT owe or be obligated to anyone until the

[student loan] debt is consolidated and a payment is made to the DOE [ED ].â

PSettlementâs Business Practices
34. PSettlement is a consumer debt-settlement company that Crenshaw formed
and began operating in 2015. PSettlement charges a fee of 25% of a customerâs enrolled
debt to negotiate settlements of the debt.
35. PSettlement solicits and signs up consumers in multiple states by telephone,

using lead referral services to transfer consumer phone calls to PSettlementâs sales staff.

Case 8:20-cv-02132 Document1 Filed 11/05/20 Page 8of21 Page ID#:8

36. One such lead referral company is OneLoanPlace.com (âOLPâ), which has
described itself as a âloan matching serviceâ for consumers. OLP is not a lender and
does not provide loans itself. As of 2019, based on records of PSettlementâs commission
payments to its lead generators, at least 3,000 of PSettlementâs referrals came from OLP.

37. Under its contract with PSettlement, OLP refers âQualifying Customersâ to
PSettlement. âQualifying Customersâ are consumers residing in certain states âwith
greater than $10,000 in unsecured debt, who have been determined by [OLP] agents to be
viable candidates for [PSettlement]âs debt resolution services in [OLP]âs sole discretion.â
In return, PSettlement pays OLP a commission calculated as a percentage of any fee that
PSettlement collects from a referred consumer who enrolls in PSettlementâs debt
resolution program.

38. One way OLP refers consumers to PSettlement is through an online
questionnaire for consumers who are seeking a personal or debt consolidation loan.
OLPâs questionnaire asks about the consumerâs credit score, the size of the loan that he or
she is seeking, and other financial information. After certain consumers submit the
questionnaire, OLP sends them an email stating ââwe matched you with our partner,
Performanceâ â omitting the âSettlementâ part of its name â and giving contact
information for OLP and âPerformance.â OLP also puts consumers in touch with
PSettlement via live call transfers of consumers looking for a loan.

39. Even though these consumers are seeking loans and PSettlement is not a
lender, PSettlementâs sales pitch misleadingly discusses the prospect of a loan.

40. After areferral by OLP, PSettlement first solicits the consumer to provide

his or her personal and financial information by telling the consumer:

We know that the loan process can be a difficult one and Iâm glad
you called let [sic] me see what we can do for you. So, what Iâm

going to do is collect as much information as possible and send it
over to my underwriting department and theyâ Il come back on the

Case 8:20-cv-02132 Document1 Filed 11/05/20 Page 9of21 Page ID #:9

line with results and let you know what you ultimately may or
may not qualify for.

41. After this introduction, the PSettlement salesperson, referred to as a âdebt
specialist,â obtains information about the consumerâs debts, income, and any hardship
conditions, and obtains the consumerâs permission to pull the consumerâs credit report.

42. Then the salesperson states that he or she is transferring the consumer to an
âunderwriterâ or âsenior underwriter.â The âunderwriterâ that the salesperson transfers
the consumer to is another employee of the sales department. There is no âunderwriterâ
position at PSettlement.

43. The âunderwriterâ tells the consumer that PSettlement will âunderwriteâ the
consumer for three options: a loan, a debt-resolution program, or bankruptcy. Neither
the âunderwriterâ nor PSettlement has any training or expertise in bankruptcy, nor does
PSettlement provide any bankruptcy services.

44. The next step is for the âunderwriterâ to put the consumer on mute for two
minutes. After the two minutes, the âunderwriterâ takes the phone off mute to tell the

consumer that the loan was declined:

Ok It looks like we werenât approved for the loan because the
debt to income ratio is too high. I even tried a smaller amount
with [OLP] and still was declined, and remember they are like
Lending Tree so they shopped this with all the unsecured lenders
not just one and unfortunately this is not an option.

45. PSettlementâs sales scripts contain no instructions for contacting OLP or
anyone else to help the consumer obtain a loan. PSettlementâs sales scripts contain no

scenario in which the consumer is approved for a loan.

46. After telling the consumer that he or she was not approved for a loan, the

PSettlement âunderwriterâ then states:

Case 8:20-cv-02132 Document1 Filed 11/05/20 Page 10of21 Page ID #:10

The good news is we did get a PREAPPROVAL for the debt
resolution program due to a DTI over 60%. The GREAT news is
IF we can get your [sic] approved for this program this is the
right fit as the total pay back is roughly 65-75% of what you owe,
which would save you thousands and give you the peace of mind
that comes with being free of these debts.

47. The âunderwriterâ moves on to pitch PSettlementâs services and persuade
the consumer to electronically sign PSettlementâs service contract during the phone call.
PSettlement uses the consumerâs personal and financial information that it collected as
part of the purported loan qualification process to steer them to sign up for PSettlementâs
services. PSettlementâs sales scripts also counsel the âunderwriterâ on how to âeducateâ
the consumer if the consumer continues to press for a loan.

48. Consumers have no way of knowing that PSettlement is not in fact assisting
them to obtain a loan during the sales call.

49. In addition, after telling consumers they were denied for a loan, the
âunderwriterâ tells the consumer about the possibility of a âfresh startâ loan from another
company that they could âbecome eligible forâ if they sign up for PSettlementâs program

and make six consecutive deposits into their trust accounts. PSettlement tells consumers:

The Fresh Start program is definitely a powerful financial tool,
but in order to be eligible to apply with our partner, you need to
begin with our Debt Resolution Program first.

50. PSettlementâs representation, after it has told consumers that they were not
approved for a loan, that it was possible for them to become eligible to obtain a loan on
the condition that they enrolled in PSettlementâs program and made certain payments,
reinforce a reasonable belief by consumers that PSettlement could obtain a loan for them,
but only if they first enrolled in PSettlementâs debt-resolution program.

51. The scripts that contain these representations were in use from at least May
2019. Two versions of the script, dated May 2019 and August 2019 respectively, contain

nearly identical language to that quoted above. In addition, it is likely that similar scripts
were in use earlier than May 2019, as PSettlement had a marketing arrangement with

OLP prior to May 2019 and the two versions of the script were labeled ââv.7â and âv.9â,
indicating that they were version 7 and version 9 of the same script.

52. Crenshaw is the controlling owner and CEO of PSettlement. Crenshaw
oversees all managers at PSettlement, was involved in creating PSettlementâs policies and
procedures, and regularly monitored the companyâs sales and customer trust accounts.
He opened PSettlementâs bank accounts, is a signatory on the accounts, and approves
disbursements from the accounts.

53. Crenshaw has participated in PSettlementâs sales pitch for leads referred by
OLP. He manages PSettlementâs relationships with lead referral services in general and
signed PSettlementâs contract with OLP in particular.

54. Crenshaw has overseen and is aware of the sales scripts and practices of the
sales department at PSettlement. He has the authority to make and has made changes to
scripts used in connection with leads generated by OLP.

55. | Crenshaw has known or has been recklessly indifferent to the fact that
PSettlementâs sales practices include deceiving consumers by pretending to try to help
them obtain a personal loan, when in reality PSettlement does nothing to help them
obtain a loan at the point of sale or enrollment and instead uses their personal and
financial information to steer them to sign up for PSettlementâs services.

VIOLATIONS OF THE TSR BY PSLC AND CRENSHAW

56. The Bureau is authorized to enforce the Telemarketing Act and the TSR
with respect to the offering or provision of a consumer financial product or service
subject to the CFPA. 15 U.S.C. Â§ 6105(d). Among other things, a consumer financial
product or service is defined by the CFPA to include âproviding financial advisory

C.F.R. Â§ 310.2(gg).

61. PSLC isa telemarketer within the meaning of the TSR that engaged in
telemarketing of debt-relief services to consumers. PSLCâs marketing of its services was

part of a âplan, program, or campaignâ to sell PSLCâs services, and involved more than
one phone and more than one interstate phone call. Consumers who spoke to sales
representatives of PSLC were located in a number of different states outside of
California, where PSLC is located.

consolidated or otherwise modified or they had made one payment on that altered debt.

69. With respect to Trust Plan Customers, PSLC required them to deposit
monthly installment payments that were exclusively comprised of PSLCâs fee into a
dedicated trust account beginning at or soon after enrollment, thus requesting or receiving
fees before those customersâ student-loan debt was consolidated or otherwise modified or
they had made one payment on that altered debt.

70. PSLC took the fees from Trust Plan Customersâ dedicated accounts at the
time the terms of their debts were altered, but before those customers had made one
payment on that altered debt.

71. By the methods described above in paragraphs 9-33, PSLC requested or
received fees from its customers before PSLC had renegotiated, settled, reduced, or
otherwise altered the terms of their debts pursuant to a settlement agreement, debt-
management plan, or other such valid contractual agreement executed by the customers,
and before its customers had made one payment pursuant to that settlement agreement,
debt-management plan, or other valid contractual agreement between the customer and
the creditor or debt collector.

72. Crenshaw participated in PSLCâs requesting and receiving of fees in this
way. He was responsible for the contract and relationship with EAC and set up the
arrangement with the trust administrator to have PSLCâs customers pay fees into trusts.

73. Crenshaw, as the CEO and sole owner of the company, had the authority to
control PSLCâs use of telemarketing and the manner and timing of its requests for and

receipt of fees.

74. Crenshaw knew about or was recklessly indifferent to the fact that PSLC
was engaged in telemarketing and the manner and timing of its requests for and receipt of

fees.
75. Therefore, PSLC and Crenshaw have engaged in abusive telemarketing acts

or practices in violation of 16 C.F.R. Â§ 310.4(a)(5).

Violations of the TSR by Crenshaw

(Substantial Assistance to PSLC in its Violations of the TSR)

76. The Bureau re-alleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1-3, 5, 6, 8,
9-33, 56-62.

77. The TSR prohibits any person from providing substantial assistance or
support to any seller or telemarketer when that person knows or consciously avoids
knowing that the seller or telemarketer is engaged in any act or practice that constitutes
deceptive or abusive conduct under the TSR. 16 C.F.R. Â§ 310.3(b).

78. PSLC isa seller and telemarketer that provided, offered to provide, or
arranged for others to provide debt-relief services.

79. Inthe course of offering to provide or providing a debt-relief service to
consumers, PSLC requested and received fees before PSLC had renegotiated, settled,
reduced, or otherwise altered the terms of its customersâ debts pursuant to a settlement
agreement, debt-management plan, or other such valid contractual agreement executed by
the customers and before the customers had made one payment pursuant to that
settlement agreement, debt-management plan, or other valid contractual agreement
between the consumers and the creditor or debt collector. Thus, PSLC engaged in abusive
acts or practices in violation of the TSR. 16 C.F.R. Â§ 310.4(a)(5).

80. Crenshaw, as sole owner and CEO of PSLC, provided substantial assistance
or support to PSLC by, among other things, overseeing all managers at PSLC and
participating in the companyâs day-to-day business operations. For example, he was a
signatory on the companyâs bank accounts, managed its relationship with EAC, and

participated in the process of setting up and managing the arrangement with the trust
account administrator to provide trust accounts for Trust Account Customers.

81. Crenshaw knew or consciously avoided knowing that PSLC was engaged in
telemarketing and that PSLC was requesting and receiving fees from customers before it
altered the terms of those consumersâ debt or they had made one payment on that altered
debt.

82. Crenshaw has violated the TSRâs ban on assisting and facilitating othersâ

violations of that rule. 16 C.F.R. Â§ 310.3(b).

83. The Bureau re-alleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1-3, 5, 6, 9-
18, 22-26, and 28-29, 56-62.

84.  Itis a violation of the TSR for any seller or telemarketer in connection with
the sale of any debt-relief service requiring customers to place funds in an account at an
insured financial institution to fail to disclose truthfully, in a clear and conspicuous
manner, before customers consent to pay for those services, that customers own the funds
held in the accounts, that customers may withdraw from the debt-relief service at any
time without penalty, and that, if customers withdraw, they must receive all funds in the
accounts other than funds earned by the debt-relief service. 16 C.F.R.

Â§ 310.3(a)C1)(vili)(D).

85. PSLC required Trust Plan Customers to place funds in an account at an
insured financial institution.

86. PSLC did not clearly and conspicuously disclose that Trust Plan Customer
owned the funds in their trust accounts and that if they withdrew from its program, the
customer must receive all funds in the account, less fees earned by PSLC.

DEFENDANTSâ VIOLATIONS OF THE CFPA

88. Section 1036(a)(1)(A) of the CFPA provides that it is âunlawful for any
covered person to offer or provide to a consumer a financial product or service not in
conformity with Federal consumer financial law, or otherwise commit any act or
omission in violation of a Federal consumer financial law.â 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(A).

89. PSLC and PSettlement are covered persons because they offer or provide
consumer financial products or services, namely financial advisory services to assist
consumers with modifying the terms of any extension of credit, including by debt
settlement. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5481(6), (A5)(A)(viindD).

90. Under the CFPA, a ârelated personâ is a covered person. 12 U.S.C.
Â§ 5481(25)(B). Crenshaw is a related person with respect to both PSLC and PSettlement,
as he is an âofficer ... charged with managerial responsibility for, or controlling
shareholder ofâ both PSLC and PSettlement. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(25)(C)(1). Therefore,
Crenshaw is a covered person.

(Deceptive Acts and Practices)

91. The Bureau re-alleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1-3, 5, 7-8,
34-55, and 88-90.

92.  Itis unlawful for any covered person or service provider to engage in a
deceptive act or practice in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a
consumer financial product or service, or the offering of a consumer financial product or

service. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531 and 5536(a)(1)(B).

Case 8:20-cv-02132 Document1 Filed 11/05/20 Page 18 of 21 Page ID #:18

93. An act or practice is deceptive if it involves a material representation that is
likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under the circumstances. A representation
is considered material if it involves information that is important to consumers and
therefore is likely to affect their choice of, or conduct regarding, a product.

94. Starting from at least May 2019, in connection with PSettlementâs
telemarketing campaign of debt-resolution services to consumers referred by OLP,
PSettlement has represented, expressly or by implication, to consumers that:

a. OLP has referred the consumer to PSettlement because PSettlement may
be able to help the consumer obtain a loan;

b. PSettlement is âunderwritingâ or âqualifyingâ the consumer for a loan;

c. PSettlement is collecting the consumerâs personal and financial
information to help the consumer obtain a loan; and

d. the consumer was turned down for a loan (i) after PSettlementâs
âunderwriterâ took the consumerâs personal and financial information
and determined the consumer did not qualify for a loan, and/or (i1) after
PSettlement âtried a smaller amount withâ OLP.

95. In truth and in fact:

a. OLP refers consumers to PSettlement after determining they are
candidates for debt resolution;

b. PSettlement is not and has never been a lender, and there is not and has
never been an âunderwriterâ position at PSettlement

c. PSettlement uses the consumersâ personal and financial information that
it has collected under the auspices of evaluating them for a loan to steer
them to sign up for PSettlementâs services; and

d. PSettlement does not, as a general practice, make any attempt to secure a
loan for a consumer before telling the consumer the loan was declined

and pitching the consumer to sign up for its debt-resolution program.

96. These misrepresentations are material and are likely to mislead consumers
acting reasonably under the circumstances.

97. Crenshaw, as controlling owner and CEO of PSettlement, has participated
and engaged in the deceptive practices. He is primarily responsible for instituting and
managing PSettlementâs marketing relationships, including with OLP. He has directly
contributed to the development and approval of materials containing the deceptive
statements by overseeing and making changes to the sales scripts that PSettlement used
with consumers referred by OLP.

98. Therefore, PSettlement and Crenshaw have engaged in deceptive acts or
practices in connection with the offering of a consumer financial product or service. 12
U.S.C. 8Â§ 5531(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).

Count V
Violations of the CFPA by Crenshaw
(Substantial Assistance to PSettlement)

99. The Bureau re-alleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1-3, 5, 7-8,
34-55, 88-98.

100. Under the CFPA, it is unlawful for any person to âknowingly or recklessly
provide substantial assistance to a covered person or service provider in violation of the
provisions of section 1031....â 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(3).

101. As described in Count IV, PSettlement has engaged in deceptive acts and
practices in violation of Â§$ 1031(a) and 1036(a)(1)(B) of the CFPA. 12 U.S.C.

Â§Â§ 5531(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).

102. Crenshaw has provided substantial assistance to PSettlement in this conduct.

103. As the controlling shareholder and CEO of PSettlement, he has associated
himself with the venture.

104. As controlling shareholder and CEO of PSettlement, Crenshaw has

participated in PSettlementâs sales efforts as something that he wished to bring about and

that he sought by his actions to make succeed. He is primarily responsible for instituting
and managing PSettlementâs marketing relationships, including with OLP. He signed the
lead referral contract with OLP.

105. Crenshaw has knowingly or recklessly provided substantial assistance to
PSettlementâs deceptive sales practices. He has directly contributed to the development
and approval of materials containing the deceptive statements by overseeing and making
changes to the sales scripts that PSettlement used with consumers referred by OLP, and
therefore he was aware of their contents and their deceptive nature.

106. Therefore, Crenshaw has substantially assisted PSettlement in engaging in
deceptive acts and practices, in violation of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(3).

Count VI
Violations of the CFPA by PSLC and Crenshaw
(CFPA Violations Based on Violations of the TSR)

107. The Bureau re-alleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1-3, 5, 6, 8,
9-33, 56-90.

108. Any act or omission in violation of a federal consumer financial law by a
covered person is a violation of the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(A).

109. The TSR is a federal consumer financial law as defined by the CFPA. 12
U.S.C Â§ 5481(14); 15 U.S.C Â§ 6105(d).

110. Therefore, PSLCâs and Crenshawâs violations of the TSR, described in
Counts I through III, constitute violations of section 1036(a)(1)(A) of the CFPA. 12
U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(A).
