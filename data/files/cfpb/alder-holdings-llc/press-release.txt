Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Arkansas Attorney General Settle with
Home-Alarm Company for Using Consumersâ Credit Scores Without Proper
Notice

DEC 11, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. â Today, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) and the
Arkansas Attorney General settled with Alder Holdings, LLC (Alder), resolving their
allegations that Alder failed to provide proper notices under the Fair Credit Reporting Act
(FCRA). Alder is a Utah-based company that sells home-security and alarm systems,
primarily door-to-door, throughout the country and has sold its products and services to
over 115,000 customers. The Bureau and Arkansas filed a proposed stipulated final
judgment and order in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas. If
entered by the court, the settlement would require Alder to pay a $600,000 civil money
penalty, $100,000 of which will be offset if Alder pays that amount to settle related litigation
with the State of Arkansas that is currently pending in state court in Arkansas. The settlement
would also require Alder to provide proper notices under FCRA.

The FCRA and its implementing regulation, Regulation V, require companies to give
consumers notice when the companies provide consumers with less favorable credit terms
based on a review of their credit reportsâalso known as risk-based pricing. The complaint
alleged that Alder, in extending credit to its customers for its home-alarm products and
services, charged customers who had lower credit scores higher activation fees, but failed
to provide those customers with the required risk-based pricing notice. Arkansas also
alleged that Alder violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010.
