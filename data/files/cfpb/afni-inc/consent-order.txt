Bloomington, IL. Respondent collects debts on behalf of

telecommunications companies and furnishes information about consumers

to CRAs.

Respondent furnishes consumer-account information to CRAs. The

consumers primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. This
activity is a consumer-financial product or service under the CFPA. 12
U.S.C. Â§ 5481(5), (15)(A)(ix).

Respondent regularly collects defaulted consumer debt related to a consumer
financial product or service, including telecommunications debt that was
owed to companies that regularly extend credit by providing
telecommunications service to consumers without requiring immediate
payment or by providing equipment installment plans. This activity is a
consumer financial product or service under the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§
5481(5), (15)(A)(x).

Respondent is a âcovered personâ under the CFPA because it engages in
offering or providing a consumer-financial product or service, 12 U.S.C. Â§
5481(5), (6), 15(A)(ix).

Respondent regularly furnishes information relating to consumers to CRAs
for inclusion in consumer reports. Therefore, it is a âfurnisherâ under
Regulation V. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1022.41(c).

Respondent is a âpersonâ under the FCRA. 15 U.S.C. Â§ 168 1a(b).

Findings and Conclusions as to Violations of Â§ 623(a)(1)(A) of the FCRA

Respondent furnishes information about debt-collection accounts to CRAs,
including the nationwide CRAs: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion (the
NCRAs).

Respondent does not, on any correspondence used generally with

consumers, clearly and conspicuously specify an address to which

consumers can send notice that information Respondent furnished to a CRA

is inaccurate.

Respondent uses an automated system, which employs certain furnishing

logic, to report information to the NCRAs.

In some instances, from at least March 2016 through July 2017,

Respondentâs furnishing logic incorrectly translated its account files into the

format used to report consumer information to the NCRAs, which resulted in

Respondent furnishing at least the following inaccurate information:

a. Respondent furnished actual payment amounts as zero dollars on
approximately 165,600 accounts, even though those consumers had made
payments.

b. Respondent also furnished current balances and amounts past due in
amounts other than zero dollars on approximately 72,000 accounts, even

though those consumersâ accounts were settled in full.

Respondent knew or had reasonable cause to believe that this information
was inaccurate because its own records reflected the correct account
information.

Under section 623(a)(1) of the FCRA, 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1681s-2(a)(1), unless a
person clearly and conspicuously specifies to a consumer an address to
which the consumer can send notice that information the person furnished to
a CRA is inaccurate, a person shall not furnish any information relating to a
consumer to any CRA if the person knows or has reasonable cause to believe
that the information is inaccurate.

Respondent furnished consumer information to CRAs that it knew or had
reasonable cause to believe was inaccurate, because the information it
furnished was different than the information in Respondentâs files.
Respondent did not clearly and conspicuously specify to consumers an
address for receipt of notices that furnished information was inaccurate,
pursuant to section 623(a)(1)(C) of the FCRA, 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1681s-2(a)(1)(C).
Thus, Respondent violated section 623(a)(1)(A) of the FCRA, 15 U.S.C. Â§

1681s-2(a)(1)(A).

Findings and Conclusions as to Violations of Â§ 623(a)(5) of the FCRA

19.

On many accounts that it furnished, from at least March 2016 through July

2018, Respondent failed to report an appropriate date of first delinquency,

1.e., the month and year of the commencement of the delinquency on the
account that immediately preceded the delinquent account being placed for
collection.

Respondentâs creditor clients did not furnish accounts to CRAs before
sending accounts into collection and therefore did not previously furnish
dates of first delinquency for those accounts.

When creditors would send accounts to Respondent for collection, the
accounts often did not specify a date of first delinquency. Instead of
establishing and following reasonable procedures to obtain dates of first
delinquency from its creditor clients, Respondent would instead select from
dates that the creditors did provide, including the date on which
telecommunications service was disconnected, or when the debt was charged
off, and Respondent would furnish such dates as the date of first
delinquency.

The disconnect date is not an accurate date of first delinquency because
telecommunications services are often not disconnected until after a
consumer has been delinquent for some time. Likewise, the date on which a
debt is charged off is not an accurate date of first delinquency because debts
are often not charged off until a consumer has been delinquent for some

time.
23.

24.

25.

Section 623(a)(5) of the FCRA, 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1681s-2(a)(5), requires that a
person who furnishes information to a CRA regarding a âdelinquent account
being placed for collectionâ must notify the CRA of the date the delinquency
commenced, subject to the rules set forth in 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1681s-2(a)(5)(B).
For many accounts on which it furnished, Respondent failed to notify the
CRA to which it furnished information of a date of first delinquency that
complied with 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1681s-2(a)(5).

Therefore, Respondent violated Â§ 623(a)(5) of the FCRA, 15 U.S.C. Â§

1681s-2(a)(5).

28.

Consumers can dispute information furnished to a CRA either with a CRA
(indirect dispute) or directly with a furnisher (direct dispute).

Respondent receives indirect disputes through the Online Solution for
Complete and Accurate Reporting (E-OSCAR). E-OSCAR is a web-based
system developed by the NCRAs to help process indirect disputes.

When a consumer submits an indirect dispute about a debt furnished by
Respondent to one of the NCRAs, it is routed to Respondent through E-
OSCAR. Any supporting documentation submitted by the consumer to the

NCRA with the dispute is also sent to Respondent through E-OSCAR. In

addition, the NCRAs assign a code to each dispute, reflecting the subject
matter of the dispute.

Upon receipt, Respondent generally has 30 days to conduct a reasonable
investigation of a dispute, as required by Â§ 623(b)(1) of the FCRA, and to
submit a response through E-OSCAR that the disputed information should
be deleted, modified, or verified as being accurate as reported.

A reasonable investigation must be responsive to the specific allegations in
the consumerâs dispute; the more specific a dispute is, the more thorough the
investigation should be.

In some instances, from at least March 2016 through June 2017, when
Respondent received disputes with specific allegations that could not be
reasonably investigated with the limited information in Respondentâs files,
Respondentâs employees did not reach out to the original creditor for the
information required to reasonably investigate the dispute. Respondentâs
employees used only the inadequate information in Respondentâs files to do
their investigations of such disputes.

Respondent also uses an automated program to handle certain indirect
disputes without human involvement. In investigating indirect disputes, the

automated program only considered information in Respondentâs own

account database, did not access any of its creditor-clientsâ files, and did not
refer disputes to clients for further investigation.

In some instances, the automated software handled indirect disputes in an
unreasonable manner because certain specific consumer disputes handled by
the automated software that should have been referred to the client for
investigation to obtain further information were not.

Under Â§ 623(b)(1) of the FCRA, 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1681s-2(b)(1), when a
furnisher of information to a CRA receives a notice of dispute regarding the
completeness or accuracy of the reported information from a CRA in
accordance with the provisions of Â§ 611(a)(2) of the FCRA, the furnisher is
required to conduct a reasonable investigation and review all relevant
information provided by the CRA.

In some instances, Respondent has not conducted a reasonable investigation
when it has received a notice of dispute from a CRA under the provisions of
Â§ 611(a)(2) of the FCRA.

Therefore, Respondent has violated Â§ 623(b)(1) of the FCRA, 15 U.S.C. Â§

1681s-2(b)(1).

38.

39.

From at least January 2016 through June 2017, Respondent failed to conduct
reasonable investigations of direct disputes.

Respondent systematically treated direct disputes under FCRA and disputes
under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCP A) as indistinguishable.
Under the FDCPA, if a consumer sends a written dispute within a specified
time period, the debt collector is required to send âvalidation,â which is
typically a bill copy or other proof of the debt. Respondent conflated FCRA
and FDCPA dispute requirements and treated many direct disputes as if they
were merely seeking FDCPA validation. As a result, when Respondent
lacked the information to reasonably investigate a direct dispute under
FCRA, Respondent would often not forward the dispute on to the client for
investigation but would instead respond with bill copies or by simply
checking Respondentâs own records, an approach that often failed to answer
the issue raised by the consumer.

In addition, for the period between January and June 2017, Respondent was
not able to access one of its creditor-clientâs system files, and did not

forward disputes on to that creditor-client for further investigation.

From at least April 2016 through June 2017, with respect to direct disputes
relating to paid accounts, Respondent ignored all such disputes after the first
two submitted by a consumer.

From March 2016 through May 2018, in certain instances, Respondent
would cause the tradelines to be deleted from consumersâ credit reports
instead of investigating the disputes.

Section 623(a)(8)(E)(1) of the FCRA, 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1681s-2(a)(8)(E)G), and Â§
1022.43(e)(1) of Regulation V, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1022.43(e)(1), require
Respondent, upon receipt of a direct dispute from a consumer, to conduct a
reasonable investigation with respect to the disputed information.

In some instances, Respondent has not conducted a reasonable investigation
when it has received a direct dispute from a consumer.

Therefore, Respondent has violated Â§ 623(a)(8)(E)(1) of the FCRA, 15
U.S.C. Â§ 1681s-2(a)(8)(E)() and Â§ 1022.43(e)(1) of Regulation V, 12 C.F.R.

49.

In addition to a failure to reasonably investigate direct disputes, from at least
January 2016 through August 2018, Respondent failed to timely respond to
direct disputes.

In some instances, Respondent failed to respond to direct disputes within 30
days, if at all.

This was caused by:

a. Respondentâs treating direct disputes under FCRA the same as disputes

under the FDCPA, which do not have a time limit for resolution;
b. significant backlogs in its dispute queues;

c. accounts being recalled by clients in response to disputes, after which
Respondent would not respond to those consumersâ disputes.

Where Respondent determined that a direct dispute was âfrivolousâ or

âirrelevantâ and therefore would not be investigated, from at least April

2016 through June 2017, Respondent failed to send required notices to the

consumer within five days of such determination.

Section 623(a)(8)(E)(i1) of the FCRA, 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1681s-2(a)(8)(E)(in),

and Â§ 1022.43(e)(3)of Regulation V, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1022.43(e)(3), require

furnishers to respond to direct disputes, generally, within 30 days of
receiving notice of the dispute.

50. In some instances, Respondent has not responded to consumersâ direct
disputes within the required time period.

51. Therefore, Respondent violated Â§ 623(a)(8)(E)(in) of the FCRA, 15 U.S.C. Â§

168 1s-2(a)(8)(E)(Gil), and Regulation V, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1022.43(e)(3).
Findings and Conclusions as to Violations of Â§ 1022.42 of Regulation V

52. Respondent did not establish or implement reasonable policies and
procedures regarding its furnishing of consumer information to CRAs, as
appropriate to the size, nature, and complexity of its furnishing activities.

53. Examples of the failures of its policies and procedures include:

a. Respondentâs indirect dispute policy did not instruct employees to access
clientsâ systems or make requests to clients to obtain information or
source documentation, as needed, before attempting to resolve an indirect

dispute.

b. Respondent had no written policies accurately explaining how its

automated E-OSCAR program responds to indirect disputes.

c. Respondent did not distinguish between direct disputes under FCRA and
disputes under FDCPA, treating both as the same, and failing to adhere to

the timing and notification requirements for FCRA disputes.

d. No policy explained how to conduct a reasonable investigation of a

FCRA dispute.

e. Respondentâs written direct dispute policy did not include procedures on

how to determine whether a dispute was frivolous or irrelevant and did

not require employees to send notices of such determination.

Respondentâs policies and procedures were also not reviewed or updated as
necessary for continued effectiveness. For example, prior to 2017,
Respondent had not modified its automated furnishing code for at least four
years. And despite Respondentâs knowledge that employees were not
complying with its dispute policies and with FCRA dispute requirements
more generally, Respondent failed to review or update its dispute policies

and procedures.

Part E of Regulation V, requires in 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1022.42 that a furnisher of

consumer information:

a. establish and implement reasonable written policies and procedures

regarding the accuracy and integrity of the information relating to

consumers that it furnishes to a consumer reporting agency, which must
be appropriate to the nature, size, complexity, and scope of the

furnisherâs activities;

b. consider and incorporate the appropriate guidelines set forth in Appendix

E of 12 C.F.R. Part 1022 in developing such policies and procedures; and

c. review such policies and procedures periodically and update them as

Respondent did not establish or implement reasonable policies and

procedures regarding its furnishing of consumer information to CRAs or

handling of consumer disputes.

Respondent did not consider or incorporate, as appropriate, the guidelines
set forth in Appendix E of Regulation V in developing its policies and
procedures regarding the accuracy and integrity of the information it

furnishes to consumer reporting agencies.

Respondent also failed to review or update its policies and procedures as

necessary for continued effectiveness.

Therefore, Respondent violated 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1022.42.

Respondent, for all purposes, must treat the civil money penalty paid under
this Consent Order as a penalty paid to the government. Regardless of how

the Bureau ultimately uses those funds, Respondent may not:

a. Claim, assert, or apply for a tax deduction, tax credit, or any other tax

benefit for any civil money penalty paid under this Consent Order; or

b. Seek or accept, directly or indirectly, reimbursement or indemnification
from any source, including but not limited to payment made under any
insurance policy, with regard to any civil money penalty paid under this

Consent Order.

To preserve the deterrent effect of the civil money penalty in any Related
Consumer Action, Respondent may not argue that Respondent is entitled to,
nor may Respondent benefit by, any offset or reduction of any compensatory
monetary remedies imposed in the Related Consumer Action because of the
civil money penalty paid in this action or because of any payment that the
Bureau makes from the Civil Penalty Fund. Ifthe court in any Related
Consumer Action offsets or otherwise reduces the amount of compensatory
monetary remedies imposed against Respondent based on the civil money
penalty paid in this action or based on any payment that the Bureau makes
from the Civil Penalty Fund, Respondent must, within 30 days after entry of

a final order granting such offset or reduction, notify the Bureau, and pay the

amended, will accrue on any outstanding amounts not paid from the date of
default to the date of payment, and will immediately become due and

payable.

Respondent must relinquish all dominion, control, and title to the funds paid
to the fullest extent permitted by law and no part of the funds may be

returned to Respondent.

Under 31 U.S.C. Â§ 7701, Respondent, unless it already has done so, must
furnish to the Bureau its taxpayer-identification numbers, which may be
used for purposes of collecting and reporting on any delinquent amount

arising out of this Consent Order.
