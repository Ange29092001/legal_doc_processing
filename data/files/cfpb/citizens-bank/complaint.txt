FACTS
Billmg Error Notices and Unauthorized Use Claims

10. The Fair Credit Billing Act, enacted and incorporated into TILA in 1974,
includes substantive protections for credit card users who have billing errors.

11. Inorder to qualify as a billing error notice, a consumerâs communication
to a creditor must: (1) be in writing; (2) be received by the creditor at the address
specified on the periodic statement disclosures; (3) be received no later than 60 days
after the creditor sent the first periodic statement reflecting the alleged billing error;
(4) relate to specified categories of billing errors; (5) enable the creditor to identify the
consumerâs name and account; and (6) to the extent possible, provide details about the
alleged error and the reasons why the consumer believes it was an error. See 12 C.F.R.
Â§ 1026.13(a)-(b). If a consumer files a billing error notice, a creditor is required to
investigate the alleged error, send certain notifications to the consumer, and refund any
amount found in error as wellas any related charges that accrued. See 12 C.F.R.

Â§ 1026.13(c), (e), and (f).

12. | TILAalso contains protections for consumers who experience
unauthorized use of their credit cards. TILAâs implementing Regulation Z defines
unauthorized use as âthe use of a credit card by a person, other than the cardholder, who
does not have actual, implied, or apparent authority for such use, and from which the
cardholder receives no benefit.â 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.12(b)(1)(i).

13. |Whenacard issuer receives a claim of unauthorized use, it is required to
investigate the claim and refund the amount in question and any related charges if
unauthorized use occurred. However, card issuers do not have to provide written

acknowledgment or notifications in response to an unauthorized use claim and the

La VAS ae GUC PUL MSO

consumer refund provision allows consumers to be held liable for up to $50. 12 C.F.R.
Â§ 1026.12(b).

14. Aclaim of unauthorized use may also constitute a billing error notice if it
meets Regulation Zâs billing error notice requirements.

Citizens Automatically Denied Claims Without an Affidavit

15. Since at least 2010 through June 2015, in numerous instances, Citizens
denied consumersâ unauthorized use claims and billing error notices because the
consumers failed to return an affidavit required by the Bank (the Fraud Affidavit).

16.  Citizensâs process permitted Bank employees to require consumers to
complete the Fraud Affidavit provided by the Bank, and automatically deny the claim if
the consumer failed to do so.

17. The Fraud Affidavit states, inter alia, that the consumer âagree[s] to
appear as a witness in Court, and to testify to the fact stated in this Affidavit ....â The
Fraud Affidavit requires notarization, and includes a notarization statement saying,
âSubscribed and sworn... .â

18. Due to the language used in the Fraud Affidavit described in Paragraph 17
and its notarization requirement, consumersâ signatures on the Fraud Affidavit were
subject to the penalty of perjury.

19. |Innumerous instances, Citizens automatically denied consumersâ billing
error notices and unauthorized use claims because those consumers refused to or were

unable to complete the Fraud Affidavit described in Paragraph 17.

Citizens Failed to Refund Finance Charges and Fees on Billing Error Notices
and Unauthorized Use Claims

20. Since at least 2010 through December 2015, Citizens failed to consistently
refund all charges, including finance charges and fees, when it resolved billing error
notices or claims of unauthorized use in consumersâ favor.

21. Inmany cases Citizens failed to refund the full amount due by either
mistakenly calculating the amount of finance charges and fees based on the date the
dispute was placed in its system of record, as opposed to when the dispute arose, or
manually miscalculating finance charges and fees related to transactions that should
have been refunded to consumers.

Citizens Failed to Notify Consumers About Claim Status

22. Since at least 2010 through February 2016, when Citizensâs Credit Card
Payment Operations Department received billing error notices, it did not consistently
send each consumer a written acknowledgement of the claim within 30 days of the
Bankâs receipt of the claim. Likewise, when the Bank conducted an investigation and
found that no billing error had occurred, Citizens did not consistently send each
consumer a written notice of denial within two complete billing cycles (or, in any event,
no later than 90 days) after receiving the claim.

Citizens Failed to Provide Credit Counseling Referrals

23. Since at least February 2010 through November 2015, the Bank advised
consumers to call a specific toll-free number at the Bank to obtain referrals to credit
counseling organizations, but the Bank hadno policies or procedures in place to ensure
that its employees provided credit counseling information when consumers called the

designated phone line.
Case 1:20-cv-00044 Document1 Filed 01/30/20 Page 6 of 12 PagelD #: 6

24. Whenconsumers called the toll-free number, they were routed based on
the status of their accounts: consumers whose accounts were in good standing were
routed to a general customer service department, and consumers whose accounts were
delinquent were routed to the collections department.

VIOLATIONS OF THE TRUTH IN LENDING ACT

25.  TILA,15 U.S.C. Â§ 1601 et seg., andits implementing Regulation Z, 12
C.F.R. pt. 1026, establish the basic rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of consumers
who use credit cards and of financial institutions or other persons that offer or service
credit cards.

26. Subject to subtitle B of the CFPA, the Bureau is authorized to enforce TILA
under subtitle E of the CFPA with respect to any person subject to TILA. 15 U.S.C.

Â§ 1607(a), (a)(6).

27.  TILAdefines a âcreditorâ as âa person who both (1) regularly extends,
whether in connection with loans, sales of property or services, or otherwise, consumer
credit which is payable by agreement in more than four installments or for which the
payment of a finance charge is or may be required, and (2) is the person to whom the
debt arising from the consumer credit transaction is initially payable on the face of the
evidence of indebtedness or, if there is no such evidence of indebtedness, by agreement.â
15 U.S.C. Â§ 1602(g).

28. Citizens is a âcreditorâ as defined under TILA.

29. Under TILA, âcreditorsâ are liable for their failure to comply with their
obligations surrounding billing error notices and unauthorized use claims, and they are
liable for failing to provide credit counseling referrals when consumers call a designated

toll-free number. 15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1637, 1643, 1666.

30. The Bureau therefore may enforce TILA and Regulation Z with respect to
Citizens.

of unauthorized use for failure of the consumers to provide Fraud Affidavits, including
agreeing to testify as witnesses, violated Regulation Z. See 12 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1026.12(b) and
