ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTIONS 6(c) and 6(d) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, MAKING
FINDINGS AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

I.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC” or “Commission”) has reason to
believe that CNCGC Hong Kong Ltd. ((CNCGC HK” or “Respondent”) violated Commission
Regulation (“Regulation”) 19.02, 17 C.F.R. § 19.02 (2016), periodically, from March 2014
through August 2015 and on October 27, 2015 and January 26, 2016 (the “Relevant Period”).
Therefore, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest that public
administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted to determine whether Respondent
engaged in the violations set forth herein and to determine whether any order should be issued
imposing remedial sanctions.

II.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Respondent has
submitted an Offer of Settlement of Respondent CNCGC Hong Kong Ltd. (“Offer”), which the
Commission has determined to accept. Without admitting or denying any of the findings and
conclusions herein, Respondent consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings
Pursuant to Sections 6(c) and 6(d) of the Commodity Exchange Act, Making Findings and
Imposing Remedial Sanctions (“Order”), and acknowledges service of this Order. '

 

Respondent consents to the entry of this Order and to the use of these findings in this proceeding and in
any other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party; provided,
however, that Respondent does not consent to the use of the Offer, or the findings in this Order consented
to in the Offer, as the sole basis for any other proceeding brought by the Commission, other than a
proceeding in bankruptcy or to enforce the terms of this Order. Nor does Respondent consent to the use
of the Offer or this Order, or the findings in this Order consented to in the Offer, by any other party in any
other proceeding.
IIL.
The Commission finds the following:

A. Summary

During the relevant period, CNCGC HK violated Regulation 19.02(a), 17 C.F.R.
§ 19.02(a) (2016), when the firm failed to file required Form 304 “Cotton On-Call Reports”
showing the quantity of call cotton bought or sold on which the price has not been fixed, together
with the respective futures on which the purchase or sale is based. Similarly, CNCGC HK
violated Regulation 19.02(b), 17 C.F.R. § 19.02(b) (2016), by filing late Form 304 reports.

B. Respondent

CNCGC Hong Kong Limited, based in Wanchai, Hong Kong, is wholly owned by China
National Cotton Group Corporation (““CNCGC”). CNCGC HK was formed in 2013 as the
investment and trading platform for CNCGC, which specializes in the ginning, importing,
warehousing and marketing of cotton. CNCGC HK has never been registered with the
Commission.

C. Facts

CNCGC HK is a cotton merchant or dealer. Whenever cotton merchants or dealers hold
or control at least 100 cotton futures positions, they are required by Regulations to file weekly
CFTC Form 304 reports with the Commission setting forth their call cotton purchases and sales
as of the close of business Friday, and are required to submit their CFTC Form 304 reports
within two business days. On 53 occasions during the relevant period, CNCGC HK held or
controlled at least 100 cotton futures positions, but failed to file CFTC Form 304 reports. Market
Surveillance staff in the Commission’s Division of Market Oversight (“DMO”) advised CNCGC
of its obligations on July 28, 2015 and, with two exceptions in which it was late filing reports —
in October 2015 and January 2016 ~ CNCGC HK has timely filed the required Form 304 since
mid-August 2015.

CNCGC HK fully cooperated during the Division of Enforcement’s investigation.
Additionally, CNCGC has implemented a compliance program for timely reporting cotton
transactions to the Commission in order to ensure that the firm files the required Form 304 each
time it carries a position of 100 or more in any one cotton futures contracts.

IV.
LEGAL DISCUSSION
Pursuant to Regulation 19.00(a)(2), 17 C.F.R. § 19.00(a)(2) (2016), cotton merchants and
dealers that hold or control reportable cotton futures positions under Regulation 15.00(p)(D@,
17 C.E.R. § 15.00(p)(1)(i) (2016), are required to file series ’04 reports. Regulation

15.00(p)(1)(i), in relevant part, defines a reportable position as any open contract position that
meets or exceeds the level set forth in Regulation 15.03, 17 C.F.R. § 15.03 (2016), in any one

2
futures contract on any reporting market at the close of the market on any business day. For

cotton futures positions, Regulation 15.03, 17 C.F.R. § 15.03 (2016), establishes 100 contracts as
the reporting level.

For cotton merchants and dealers with reportable positions, “CFTC Form 304 reports
showing the quantity of call cotton bought or sold on which the price has not been fixed, together
with the respective futures on which the purchase or sale is based” must be filed. 17 C.F.R.

§ 19.02(a) (2016). Call cotton refers to “spot cotton bought or sold, or contracted for purchase or
sale at a price to be fixed later based upon a specified future.” 17 C.F.R. § 19.02(a) (2016).

Each CFTC Form 304 report must be “made weekly as of the close of business on Friday and
filed... not later than the second business day following the date of the report.” 17 C.F.R.

§ 19.02(b) (2016). See also CFTC Staff Advisory No. 13-14 (“Obligation of Reportable Market
Participants to File CFTC Form 304 Reports for Call Cotton in a Timely Manner as Required by
Commission Regulation 19.02”) (DMO May 8, 2013).

By failing to file CFTC Form 304 reports as set forth above, CNCGC HK violated
Regulation 19.02 (a) and (b). See 17 C.F.R. § 19.02(a), (b) (2016).

Vv.
FINDINGS OF VIOLATION

Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that, during the relevant period,
Respondent violated Regulation 19.02(a) and (b), 17 C.F.R. § 19.02(a), (b) (2016).
