INFORMATION
THE UNITED STATES CHARGES:
Introduction

At all times material to this information:

1, Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (together with its subsidiaries and
affiliates, âPDVSAâ) was the Venezuelan state-owned and state-controlled oil
company. PDVSA was responsible for the exploration, production, refining,
transportation, and trade in energy resources in Venezuela and provided funding
for other operations of the Venezuelan government. PDVSA and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries, including PDVSA Services, Inc. (âPSIâ), were âinstrumentalitiesâ of
the Venezuelan government as that term is used in the Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act (âFCPAâââ), Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2(h)(2)(A).

2. Defendant IVAN ALEXIS GUEDEZ (âDefendantâ), a United States

citizen and resident of Texas, was employed by PDVSA, or by wholly-owned
subsidiaries or affiliates thereof, from in or around 2006 until in or around early
2011. During that time, Defendant held a number of positions related to
procurement, including serving as the purchasing manager for PSI, the PDVSA
procurement subsidiary in Houston, Texas. Defendantâs job responsibilities
included approving and releasing purchase orders and adding vendors to PDVSA
contract bid lists. While employed at PDVSA, Defendant was a âforeign officialâ
as that term is used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-
2(h)(2)(A).

3. At all relevant times, âCO-CONSPIRATOR 1,â an individual whose
identity is known to the United States and who has been charged separately, was
employed by PDVSA or by wholly-owned subsidiaries or affiliates thereof. CO-
CONSPIRATOR 1 was a naturalized United States citizen and a resident of Texas.
During the relevant time period, CO-CONSPIRATOR 1 held a number of
management positions related to procurement for PDVSA, including sourcing
supervisor and manager for planning and strategic sourcing. CO-CONSPIRATOR
1âs responsibilities included supervision of single source procurement and
competitive bidding processes, including selecting companies for bidding panels.
CO-CONSPIRATOR | was thus a âforeign officialâ as that term is used in the

FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2(h)(2)(A).
4. At all relevant times, âCO-CONSPIRATOR 2,â an individual whose
identity is known to the United States, was employed by PDVSA or by wholly-
owned subsidiaries or affiliates thereof. CO-CONSPIRATOR 2 was a naturalized
US. citizen. CO-CONSPIRATOR 2 was a PDVSA buyer who reported to
Defendant. CO-CONSPIRATOR 2 was thus a âforeign officialâ as that term is
used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2(h)(2)(A).

5. âCOMPANY A,â a company whose identity is known to the United
States, was a Miami-based supplier of industrial equipment. COMPANY A was
PDVSAâs exclusive supplier of heavy equipment manufactured by another
company headquartered in the United States. COMPANY A was thus a âdomestic
concernâ as that term is used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section
78dd-2(h)(1)(A).

6. At all relevant times, âCO-CONSPIRATOR 3,â an individual whose
identity is known to the United States, was the sales manager of COMPANY A
and a resident of Florida. CO-CONSPIRATOR 3 was thus a âdomestic concernâ
and an employee and agent of a domestic concern as those terms are used in the
FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Sections 78dd-2(a) and (h)(1)(A).

7. At all relevant times, âCO-CONSPIRATOR 4,â an individual whose
identity is known to the United States, was a manager at COMPANY A and CO-

CONSPIRATOR 3âs supervisor. CO-CONSPIRATOR 4 was also a resident of

rat

Florida. CO-CONSPIRATOR 4 was thus a âdomestic concernâ and an employee
and agent of a domestic concern as those terms are used in the FCPA, Title 15,

United States Code, Sections 78dd-2(a) and (h)(1)(A).

COUNT ONE
(18 U.S.C. Â§ 371 â Conspiracy)
8. | Beginning in or around 2009 and continuing through at least 2013, the
defendant,
IVAN ALEXIS GUEDEZ,
did willfully, that is, with the intent to further the objects of the conspiracy, and
knowingly conspire, confederate, and agree with others known and unknown to the
United States, including CO-CONSPIRATORS 1, 2, 3, and 4, to commit offenses
against the United States, namely
a. knowing that the property involved in a financial transaction

represented the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity, to

conduct or attempt to conduct such a financial transaction which in

fact represented the proceeds of specified unlawful activity, knowing

that the transaction is designed in whole or in part to conceal and

disguise the nature, the location, the source, the ownership, and the

control of the proceeds of specified unlawful activity, namely, bribery

of a foreign official, a felony violation of the FCPA, Title 15, United

4
States Code, Section 78dd-2, in violation of Title 18, United States
Code, Section 1956(a)(1)(B)(i); and
b. transporting, transmitting, or transferring, or attempting to transport,
transmit, or transfer a monetary instrument or funds from a place in
the United States to or through a place outside the United States or to
a place in the United States from or through a place outside the United
States with the intent to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful
activity, namely, bribery of a foreign official, a felony violation of the
FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2, in violation of
Title 18, United States Code, Section 1956(a)(2)(A).
Purpose of the Conspiracy
9. The purpose of the conspiracy was for Defendant, CO-
CONSPIRATORS 1, 2, 3, and 4, and others to engage in financial transactions to
conceal and disguise bribe payments to Defendant, CO-CONSPIRATOR-1, CO-
CONSPIRATOR 2, and others, all in an effort by CO-CONSPIRATOR 3 and CO-
CONSPIRATOR 4 to secretly and illegally gain an improper advantage for

Company A in obtaining and retaining business with PDVSA.
Manner and Means of the Conspiracy

10. The manner and means by which Defendant and his co-conspirators
sought to accomplish the purpose of the conspiracy included, among other things,
the following, while in the Southern District of Texas and elsewhere:

11. Beginning in or around 2009 and continuing through at least 2013, the
conspirators would and did agree that 3% of every payment made by PDVSA to
COMPANY A would be split as bribe payments and kickbacks as follows:

a. Initially, as an even four-way split between bribes to Defendant, CO-
CONSPIRATOR 1, and CO-CONSPIRATOR 2, and kickbacks to CO-
CONSPIRATOR 3;

b. After CO-CONSPIRATOR 2âs employment at PDVSA was terminated,
evenly split between Defendant, CO-CONSPIRATOR 1, and CO-
CONSPIRATOR 2; and

c. From in or around March 2012, after CO-CONSPIRATOR 4 approached
the others and demanded a share in exchange for not exposing the
scheme, until at least 2013, CO-CONSPIRATOR 4 received 0.5% while
Defendant, CO-CONSPIRATOR 1, and CO-CONSPIRATOR 3 split the
remaining 2.5%.

12. In exchange for the bribe payments, Defendant, CO-CONSPIRATOR

1, and CO-CONSPIRATOR 2 would and did direct PDVSA business toward
COMPANY A, including by encouraging end users to request equipment sold by
COMPANY A, and work to ensure PDVSA paid COMPANY Aâs outstanding
invoices.
| 13. The conspirators would and did attempt to conceal, and did in fact
conceal, the nature, source, and ownership of the bribes, which they referred to as
âcommissions,â by:
a. Using a Panamanian shell company and a corresponding Swiss bank
account to receive the 3% payments;
b. Creating and using multiple email accounts under the name of a shell
company and other fictitious names to discuss the scheme;
c. Creating and transmitting false invoices in the amount of 3% of whatever
payment PDVSA had made to COMPANY A; and
d. Dispersing the proceeds from the Swiss bank account to each co-
conspirator, including through offshore accounts, accounts in the names
of relatives, and companies owned in the name of the relatives.
Overt Acts
14. In furtherance of the conspiracy and to achieve the objects thereof, at

least one of the co-conspirators committed or caused to be committed, in the
Southern District of Texas and elsewhere, at least one of the following overt acts,
among others:

15. Inor around 2009, Defendant, CO-CONSPIRATOR 1, CO-
CONSPIRATOR 2, and CO-CONSPIRATOR 3 met at a restaurant in Houston,
Texas, to discuss COMPANY Aâs business with PDVSA, during which the co-
conspirators agreed that the PDVSA officials would assist COMPANY A in
retaining and obtaining business with PDVSA and obtaining payment from
PDVSA in exchange for bribe payments amounting to 3% of each payment
COMPANY A received from PDVSA, which the co-conspirators would split
amongst themselves.

16. Onor about October 28, 2011, CO-CONSPIRATOR 3 sent an email
to Defendant and CO-CONSPIRATOR 1 containing a chart that listed various
payments from PDVSA to COMPANY A. The chart stated that the total amount
of payments to COMPANY A was $2,762,698.44, and the corresponding 3%
payment for the conspirators was $82,880.95.

17. Onor about November 2, 2011, Defendant sent an email to CO-
CONSPIRATOR 4 containing a chart with the same financial breakdown as the
email mentioned in Paragraph 16. Defendant attached to the email a false invoice

dated November 2, 2011, in the Panamanian shell companyâs name, for

$82,880.95.
18. In or around November 2012, Defendant recorded in a spreadsheet
tracking the bribe proceeds that COMPANY A had deposited $82,880.95 into the
Swiss bank account in payment for the false invoice dated November 2, 2011.

19. Onor about December 2, 2012, CO-CONSPIRATOR 3 sent an email
to Defendant and CO-CONSPIRATOR 1 containing a chart which listed payments
from PDVSA to COMPANY A for invoices issued in June and July 2012. The
chart stated that the total amount of payments to COMPANY A was
$2,073,905.69, and the corresponding 3% âcommissionâ totaled $62,217.17.

20. Onor about December 26, 2012, Defendant sent an email to CO-
CONSPIRATOR 4, containing a chart with the same financial breakdown as the
chart mentioned in Paragraph 19. Defendant attached to the email a false invoice
dated December 23, 2012, in the Panamanian shell companyâs name, for
$62,217.17.

21. Inor around December 2012, Defendant recorded in a spreadsheet
tracking the bribe proceeds that COMPANY A had deposited $62,217.17 into the
Swiss bank account in payment for the false invoice dated December 23, 2012.

22. Inor around 2012 or 2013, Defendant and CO-CONSPIRATOR 1
created a fictitious company and wired $650,000.00 from the Swiss account to a
relative of Defendantâs, which corrupt proceeds a second relative of Defendantâs
