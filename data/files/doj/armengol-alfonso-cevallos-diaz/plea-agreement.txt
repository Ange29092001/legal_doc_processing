in addition to any sentence imposed under paragraphs 3 and 4 of

âthis agreement, a special assessment in the amount of $100 per

 

 
 

count will be imposed on the defendant. The defendant agrees that
; ,

any special assessment imposed. shall be paid at the time of

sentencing. If the defendant is financially unable to pay. the

special assessment, the defendant agrees to present evidence to

the Government and the Court at the time-of sentencing as to the

reasons for the defendantâs failure to pay.

the probation office of all facts pertinent to the sentencing
process, including all relevant information concerning the
offenses committed, whether charged or not, as well as concerning

express terms of any agreed-upon sentencing recommendations
contained in this agreement, the Government further reserves the
right to make any recommendation as to the quality and quantity of
punishment.

7. The Government agrees to recommend at sentencing that the
Court reduce by two levels the -sentencing guideline level
applicable to the defendantâs offense, pursuant to Section
3E1.1(a) of the Sentencing Guidelines, based upon the defendant's
recognition and affirmative and timely acceptance of personal
responsibility. If at the time of sentencing the defendantâs
offense level is determined to be 16 or greater, the Government

will make a motion requesting, an additional one-level decrease

 

 

 
 

pursuant to Section 3E1.1(b) of the Sentencing Guidelines, stating
that the defendant has assisted authorities in the investigation
or prosecution of his own misconduct by timely notifying
authorities of his intention to enter a plea of guilty, thereby
permitting the Government to avoid preparing for trial and
permitting the Government and the Court to allocate their resources
efficiently. The Government, however, will not be required to
make this motion and this recommendation if the defendant: (a)
fails or refuses -to make a full, accurate, and complete disclosure
to the probation office of the circumstances surrounding the
relevant offense conduct; (b) is found to have misrepresented facts
to the Government prior to entering into this plea agreement; or

violating any term of release, or making false statements or
misrepresentations to any governmental entity or official.

not binding on the probation office or the Court, they will jointly
recommend that the Court make the following findings and
conclusions as to the sentence to be imposed, with both parties
reserving the right to argue regarding the application or non-

application of other guideline provisions not addressed below:
   

 

a. Base offense level: Pursuant to U.S.S.G. Â§ 2S51.1(a) (1),
that the base offense level for purposes of sentencing guideline
calculations for the charged offenses is 12 (see Â§2C1.1), plus the
number of offense levels from the table in Â§2Bl1.1 corresponding to
the value of the unlawful payments /laundered funds (more than $3.5
million and less than $9.5 million), adding 18 levels;

b. Offense of conviction: That a two-level enhancement of the

 

}

guideline offense level applies under U.S.S.G. Â§ 2.S1.1(b) (2) (B)

_ for a conviction under Title 18, United States Code, Section 1956;

 

Cc. Sophisticated means: That a two-level increase to the
offense level applies since the offense involved sophisticated
means pursuant to U.S.S.G. Â§ 2S1.1(b) (3); and

d. the defendant has a Criminal History Category of I.

9. In the event that the defendant chooses toâ seek a variance
from the sentencing guideline range, the defendant further agrees
that any such application shall be filed in writing with the Court

-is not limited to forfeiture money judgments:. (a) equal in value

to the total amount of proceeds he obtained as a result of the
violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 371; and (b) in
the sum of $4,400,000 in United States currency, which sum
represents the value of the property subject to forfeiture for the
violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1956 (h).

11. The defendant further agrees that forfeiture is
independent of any assessment, fine, cost, restitution, or penalty
that may be imposed by the Court. The defendant knowingly and
voluntarily agrees to waive all constitutional, legal, and

equitable defenses to the forfeiture, including excessive fines

under the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. In

14. The defendant is aware that Title 18, United States
Code, Section 3742 and Title 28, United States Code, Section 1291
afford the defendant the right to appeal the sentence imposed in

this case. Acknowledging this, in exchange for the undertakings

made by the United States in this plea agreement, the defendant

hereby waives all rights conferred by Sections 3742 and 1291 to
appeal any sentence imposed, including any restitution order, or
to appeal the manner in which the sentence was imposed, unless the
sentence exceeds the maximum permitted by statute or is the result
of an upward departure and/or an upward variance from the advisory

guideline range that the Court establishes at sentencing. The

10

 

\aA

 

 

 
defendant further understands that nothing in this agreement shall
affect the Governmentâs right and/or duty to appeal as set forth
in Title 18, United States Code, Section 3742(b) and Title 28,
United States Code, Section 1291. However, if the United States
appeals the defendantâs sentence pursuant to Sections 3742(b) and
1291, the defendant shall be released from the above waiver of
appellate rights. In addition to the foregoing provisions, the
defendant hereby waives all rights to argue on appeal that the
statute to which the defendant is pleading guilty is
unconstitutional and that the admitted conduct does not fall within
the scope of the statute. By signing this agreement, the defendant
acknowledges that the defendant has discussed the appeal waiver
set forth in this agreement with the defendantâs attorney.

15. The defendant.is aware that the sentence has not yet
been determined by the Court. The defendant also is aware that
any estimate of the probable sentencing range or sentence that the
defendant may receive, whether that estimate comes from the
defendantâs attorney, the Government, ox the probation office, is
a prediction, not a promise, and is not binding on the Government,

the probation office, or the Court. The defendant understands

further that any recommendation that the Government makes to theâ

Court as to sentencing, whether pursuant to this agreement or

otherwise, is not binding on the Court, and the Court may disregard

â11

 

 
the recommendation in its entirety. The defendant understands and
acknowledges, as previously acknowledged. in paragraph 2 above,
that the defendant may not withdraw his plea based upon the Courtâs
decision not to accept a sentencing recommendation made by the
defendant, the Government, or a recommendation made jointly by
both the defendant and the Government.

16. The defendant agrees that, effective as of the date the
defendant signs this Plea Agreement and the Factual Proffer, and
notwithstanding any other subsequent event, including but not
limited to the defendantâs failure to plead guilty, the Courtâs
refusal to accept the defendantâs guilty plea, or the defendantâs
withdrawal (or attempted withdrawal). of his guilty plea, the
Factual Proffer entered in connection with this Plea Agreement
shall be admissible against the defendant in any criminal case
involving the Fraud Section and the defendant, as: (a) substantive
evidence offered by the government in its case-in-chief and
rebuttal case; (b) impeachment evidence offered -by the government
on cross-examination; and (c) evidence at any sentencing hearing
or other hearing. In addition, the defendant also agrees not to
assert any claim under the Federal Rules of Evidence (including
Rule 410 of the Federal Rules of Evidence), the Federal Rules of
Criminal Procedure (including Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of

Criminal Procedure), or the United States Sentencing Guidelines

a 12

=

 

feet
(including U.S.S.G. Â§ 1B1.1(a)) that the Factual Proffer entered
in connection with this Plea Agreement should be suppressed or is
otherwise inadmissible as evidence (in any form).

17. The defendant recognizes that pleading guilty may have
consequences with respect to the defendantâs immigration status if
the defendant is not a citizen of the United States. Under federal
law, a broad range of crimes are removable offenses, including the
offense to which the defendant is. pleading guilty. Indeed,
because the defendant is pleading guilty to a conspiracy to launder
money, removal is presumptively mandatory. Removal and other
âimmigration consequences are the subjÃ©ctâ of a separate proceeding,
however, and defendant understands that no one, including the
defendantâs attorney or the Court, can predict to a certainty the
effect of the defendantâs conviction on the defendantâs
immigration status. Defendant nevertheless affirms that the
defendant wants to plead guilty regardless of any immigration
_ consequences that the defendantâ s plea may entail, even if the
consequence is the defendantâ s automatic removal from the United

States.

13

 

 
18.Â° This is the entire agreement and understanding between
the United States and the defendant. There are no other

agreements, promises, representations, or understandings.
