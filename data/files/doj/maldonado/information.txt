MALDONADO-BARILLAS Â§

INFORMATION
THE UNITED STATES CHARGES:
Introduction

At all times material to this information:

1, Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (âPDVSAâ) was the Venezuelan state-
owned and state-controlled oil company. PDVSA and its subsidiaries were
responsible for the exploration, production, refining, transportation, and trade in
energy resources in Venezuela and provided funding for other operations of the
Venezuelan government. PDVSA and its wholly-owned subsidiaries were
âinstrumentalitiesâ of the Venezuelan government as that term is used in the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (âFCPAâ), Title 15, United States Code, Section
78dd-2(h)(2){A).

2. Defendant CHRISTIAN JAVIER MALDONADO BARILLAS
(âDefendant MALDONADOâ), a resident of Venezuela and later Fort Bend

County, Texas, was employed by PDVSA or by wholly-owned subsidiaries or
affiliates thereof at all relevant times beginning in or around 2005. During that
time, Defendant MALDONADO held a number of positions related to purchasing,
including serving as a purchasing analyst for the PDVSA procurement subsidiary
responsible for equipment purchases. Defendant MALDONADOâs job
responsibilities included selecting companies for bidding panels, which allowed
those companies to submit bids on individual PDVSA projects. Defendant
MALDONADO served as the purchasing analyst in connection with the award of
a series of contracts in 2010 to purchase power generation equipment worth over
$700 million in response to an electrical emergency in Venezuela. Defendant
MALDONADO was a âforeign officialâ as that term is used in the FCPA, Title
15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2(h)(2)(A).

3. âBUSINESSMAN 1,â an individual whose identity is known to the
United States, was the owner of a number of U.S.-based energy companies,
including several companies based in the Southern District of Texas, that supplied
equipment and services to PDVSA, and a resident of Texas, and thus a âdomestic
concernâ and an officer, director, employee, agent, and shareholder of a âdomestic
concernâ as those terms are used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code,
Section 78dd-2(h)(1). One of the companies owned by BUSINESSMAN 1 and

based in the Southern District of Texas was awarded one of the 2010 PDVSA
contracts in connection with the Venezuelan electrical emergency that was worth
more than $200 million.

4, âBUSINESSMAN 2,â an individual whose identity is known to the
United States, was the owner of a number of other U.S.-based energy companies
that supplied equipment and services to PDVSA, and a resident of the United
States, and thus a âdomestic concernâ and an officer, director, employee, agent,
and shareholder of a âdomestic concernâ as those terms are used in the FCPA, Title
15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2(h)(1). BUSINESSMAN I and
BUSINESSMAN 2 worked together on a number of PDVSA contracts and
contract bids.

5. âASSOCIATE 1â was an associate of BUSINESSMAN 1 and
BUSINESSMAN 2 who assisted them in their business operations, including by
establishing connections between BUSINESSMAN 1| and BUSINESSMAN 2 and

foreign officials employed by PDVSA and its subsidiaries.

COUNT ONE
(18 U.S.C. Â§ 371 â Conspiracy)

6. Beginning in at least 2009 and continuing through at least 2012, the

defendant,

CHRISTIAN JAVIER MALDONADO BARILLAS,
did willfully, that is, with the intent to further the objects of the conspiracy, and
knowingly conspire, confederate, and agree with others known and unknown to the
United States, including BUSINESSMAN 1, BUSINESSMAN 2 and
ASSOCIATE 1, to commit offenses against the United States, that is:

with the intent to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity,
namely, bribery of a foreign official, a felony violation of the FCPA, Title 15,
United States Code, Section 78dd-2, transport, transmit, or transfer funds from a
place in the United States to a place outside the United States, in violation of Title
18, United States Code, Section 1956(a)(2)(A).

Purpose of the Conspiracy

7. The purpose of the conspiracy was for BUSINESSMAN 1,
BUSINESSMAN 2, ASSOCIATE 1, and their co-conspirators to transfer funds
through financial institutions in order to facilitate bribe payments to Defendant
MALDONADO, in order to promote an illegal scheme by which
BUSINESSMAN 1, BUSINESSMAN 2, and their cohorts would gain an improper
advantage in obtaining and retaining lucrative energy contracts with PDVSA.

Manner and Means of the Conspiracy

8. | The manner and means by which Defendant MALDONADO and his

co-conspirators sought to accomplish the purpose of the conspiracy included,
among other things, the following, while in the Southern District of Texas and
elsewhere:

9. Defendant MALDONADO, BUSINESSMAN 1, BUSINESSMAN 2,
and ASSOCIATE 1, together with others, agreed that, in exchange for Defendant
MALDONADOâs assistance in helping BUSINESSMAN 1âs and
BUSINESSMAN 2âs companies win and receive payment for PDVSA contracts,
BUSINESSMAN 1 and BUSINESSMAN 2 would pay bribes to Defendant
MALDONADO.

10. Defendant MALDONADO, BUSINESSMAN 1, BUSINESSMAN 2,
and ASSOCIATE 1, together with others, further agreed that, in exchange for bribe
payments, Defendant MALDONADO would provide BUSINESSMAN 1 and
BUSINESSMAN 2 with inside information concerning the PDVSA bidding
process, place BUSINESSMAN 1âs and BUSINESSMAN 2âs companies on the
bidding panels for PDVSA projects, update and modify contract documents,
including change orders to PDVSA contracts awarded to BUSINESSMAN 1âs and
BUSINESSMAN 2âs companies, and give payment priority to projects involving
BUSINESSMAN | and BUSINESSMAN 2.

11. Defendant MALDONADO, together with others, including

BUSINESSMAN 1, BUSINESSMAN 2, and ASSOCIATE 1, further agreed to
promote, and did in fact promote, the unlawful bribery scheme through the transfer
of funds from a place within the United States to a place outside the United States.

12. Defendant MALDONADO, together with others, including
BUSINESSMAN 1, BUSINESSMAN 2, and ASSOCIATE 1, further agreed to
take steps, and did in fact take steps, to conceal the unlawful payments by opening
a bank account outside of Venezuela for Defendant MALDONADO to receive the
bribe payments.

Overt Acts

13. In furtherance of the conspiracy and to achieve the objects thereof, at
least one of the co-conspirators committed or caused to be committed, in the
Southern District of Texas and elsewhere, at least one of the following overt acts,
among others:

14. In or around 2009, ASSOCIATE 1, on behalf of BUSINESSMAN 2,
and Defendant MALDONADO met in Venezuela during which they reached an
agreement that Defendant MALDONADO would provide BUSINESSMAN 2
with inside information concerning the PDVSA bidding process and place
BUSINESSMAN 2âs companies on PDVSA bidding panels in exchange for bribes.

15. In or around 2009, Defendant MALDONADO created a private email

account so that he could communicate with BUSINESSMAN 2 and ASSOCIATE
1 about the bribery scheme without using his official email account maintained by
the PDVSA procurement subsidiary.

16. Inor around-early 2010, Defendant MALDONADO,
BUSINESSMAN 1, BUSINESSMAN 2, and ASSOCIATE | met at a hotel in
Caracas, Venezuela during which they reached an agreement that Defendant
MALDONADO would place BUSINESSMAN 1âs companies on PDVSA bidding
panels in exchange for bribes.

17. In or around 2010, ASSOCIATE 1 helped Defendant
MALDONADO to open a bank account in Panama, in order to receive bribe
payments outside Venezuela.

18. In or around 2010, Defendant MALDONADO provided
ASSOCIATE 1 with the account information to the bank account referenced in
Paragraph 17 above so that BUSINESSMAN 1, BUSINESSMAN 2, and
ASSOCIATE 1 could send bribes to Defendant MALDONADO.

19. Onor about April 9, 2010, BUSINESSMAN 1 caused $100,000 to be
transferred from a bank account in the United States in the name of a company
owned by BUSINESSMAN 1 to Defendant MALDONADOâs bank account in
Panama.

All in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 371.

traceable to the commission of these offenses, and all property traceable to such
property.
