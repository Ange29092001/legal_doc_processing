identity is known to the United States and the Defendants, in exchange for Iraq

Official 2âs agreement to provide Intermediary Companyâs employees with

16
Case 4:19-cr-00147 Documentis Filed on 03/04/19 in TXSD Page 17 of 56

confidential documents and information from SOE-1, and a promise by Iraq
Official 2 to help steer SOE-1 contract awards to Intermediary Companyâs client
companies, including, but not limited to SBM, Company 1, Company 5, Company
8, and Company 9.

49. Inor around August 2009, Defendants C. AHSANI and S. AHSANE,
together with others, including, but not limited to, CC-1, CC-2, CC-3, CC-4, and
CC-7 also agreed to begin paying bribes to âIraq Official 3â and âTraq
Official 4,â two senior Iraqi government officials whose identities are known to the
United States and the Defendants, in order to ensure that the Iraqi government
approved certain work for Intermediary Companyâs client companies, including,
but not limited to, SBM, Company 1, Company 5, Company 8, and Company 9.

50. Specifically, in or around and between 2009 and 2010, Defendants
C. AHSANE S. AHSANTI, and others, including but not limited to CC-3, obtained
confidential bidding information from Iraq Official 2 identifying the scope of âIraq
Project 1,â a major oil and gas development project in Iraq that is known to the
United States and Defendants, and other information revealing the identity of the
likely bidders for related sub-projects, including âIraq Project 1A,â âIraq Project
1B,â and âIraq Project 1C,â sub-projects to Iraq Project 1 that are known to the

United States and Defendants.

17
Case 4:19-cr-00147 Documentis Filed on 03/04/19 in TXSD Page 18 of 56

51. On or about May 26, 2010, CC-2 attended a meeting in Perth,
Australia with employees of Company 8 and Company 9 in which they agreed to
enter into a corrupt bid-rigging process. At the meeting, CC-2 agreed with certain
employees of Company 8 and Company 9 that CC-2 would act as a go-between to
share information between Company 8 and Company 9, so that Company 8 and
Company 9 could adjust their bids to ensure that Company 8 won Iraq Project 1A
and Company 9 won Iraq Project 1B. As part of the agreement, Company 8 and
Company 9 also agreed to retain certain subsidiaries and affiliates of Intermediary
Company as sub-contractors on the projects. Certain executives at Company 8 and
Company 9 ensured that Intermediary Companyâs subsidiary and affiliated
companies would be paid so that Intermediary Company had sufficient funds to
make bribe payments to Iraqi government officials.

52. Onor about October 23, 2010, the government of Iraq awarded Iraq
Project 1A to Company 8.

53. Thereafter, Defendants C. AHSANI and S. AHSANI, and others,
including certain executives and employees at Company 8 and Company 9, agreed
to pay approximately $8.25 million to CC-7, portions of which they understood
would be paid as bribes to Iraq Official 2, Iraq Official 3, and Iraq Official 4 in

order to guarantee that the Iraqi government would approve Company 8âs and

18
e,

Case 4:19-cr-00147 Documentis Filed on 03/04/19 in TXSD Page 19 of 56

Company 9âs project bids in a timely manner, and approve Intermediary
Companyâs subsidiary and affiliated companies as sub-contractors.

54. In addition to the above, Defendants C. AHSANI, S. AHSANTI, and
others, acting within the scope of their agency and other agreements and for the
benefit of Intermediary Company and Intermediary Companyâs client companies,
conspired with others, including certain client company executives and employees,
to pay bribes, promise to pay bribes, offer to pay bribes, and authorize the payment
of bribes to foreign government officials in Iraq, including within SOE-1 and SOE-
2, in order to obtain the following projects:

a. In or around 2005, and in conspiracy with certain executives
and employees at Company 22, at least one project for Company 22, In
furtherance of the conspiracy, Defendant C. AHSANI and others agreed to pay
kickbacks to an executive at Company 22;

b. In or around and between 2008 and 2011, and in conspiracy
with certain executives and employees at Company 1, at least seven projects for
Company 1;

c. In or around and between 2010 and 2013, and in conspiracy
with certain executives and employees of SBM, Iraq Project 1C and at least two

other sub-projects to Iraq Project 1 for SBM;

19
Case 4:19-cr-00147 Documentis Filed on 03/04/19 in TXSD Page 20 of 56

d. In or around and between 2010 and 2014, and in conspiracy
with certain executives and employees at Company 8, at least one sub-project to
Iraq Project | for Company 8;

e. In or around and between 2011 and 2013, at least one
engineering and construction project for Intermediary Company;

f. In or around and between 2013 and 2015, and in conspiracy
with certain executives and employees at Company 5, an option to substitute
Company 5 equipment in the project identified above in paragraph 54(e); and

g. In or around 2015, and in conspiracy with certain executives
and employees at Company 25, at least one maintenance management services
project for Company 25.

Kazakhstan

55. In Kazakhstan, Defendants C. AHSANI and S. AHSANI conspired
with others, including certain executives and employees at client companies of
Intermediary Company, to pay bribes, promise to pay bribes, offer to pay bribes,
and authorize the payment of bribes to foreign government officials, including at
SOE-3 and SOE-4, in order to obtain improper business advantages and to obtain
and retain business for Intermediary Company and its co-conspirator client
companies, including, but not limited to, Company 3, Company 4, Company 6,

Company 7, Company 13, Company 14, Company 19, Company 20, and Company

20
Case 4:19-cr-00147 Documentis Filed on 03/04/19 in TXSD Page 21 of 56

21. Defendants C. AHSANI and 8S. AHSANI also conspired with others to engage
in other corrupt conduct, such as bid-rigging, paying kickbacks, and laundering of
the proceeds of the corrupt schemes.

56. For example, by at least in or around 2001, Defendant C. AHSANI
and others learned that the government of Kazakhstan would be seeking bids for
various sub-projects on âKazakhstan Project 1.â At the time, Defendant
C. AHSAN] also learned that SOE-3 had appointed a consortium of large oil and
gas services companies to assist with the bidding. Defendant C. AHSANI and
others knew that SOE-4, as the operator of the project, evaluated bids made by the
oil and gas companies and that SOE-4 made recommendations to SOE-3 for final
approval of certain significant contract awards.

57. In or around 2002, Company 3 retained Intermediary Company for
work in Kazakhstan. In or before October 2002, Defendant C. AHSANI and
others identified for certain Company 3 executives and employees âKazakhstan
Project 1A,â a sub-project to Kazakhstan Project I that is known to the United
States and Defendants, as a viable project for Company 3. In order to win that
project, Defendant C. AHSANI conspired with others, including CC-2 and certain
Company 3 executives, to bribe government officials in Kazakhstan in order to win

âKazakhstan Project 1A.â

21
Case 4:19-cr-00147 Documentis Filed on 03/04/19 in TXSD Page 22 of 56

58. Specifically, on or about December 31, 2004, Defendant C. AHSANI
promised to pay approximately $1.6 million to âKazakh Official 1,â a high-level
executive at SOE-4 whose identity is known to the United States and the
Defendants, in return for Kazakh Official 1âs assistance with helping to award
Kazakhstan Project 1A to Company 3. Although the promise to pay bribes
occurred while Kazakh Official 1 worked for SOE-4, Intermediary Company did
not make any payments to Kazakh Official 1 until Kazakh Official 1 stopped
working for SOE-4; Defendant C. AHSANI did, however, arrange for the
purchase of an automobile and furniture for Kazakh Official 1 while Kazakh
Official 1 was still employed by SOE-4. Thereafter, in or about and between
February 2005 and October 2006, Defendant C. AHSANI and others caused
Intermediary Company to make payments to a company they knew was
beneficially owned and controlled by Kazakh Official 1, as had been promised, in
return for Kazakh Official 1âs prior assistance in securing Kazakhstan Project 1A
for Company 3.

59. Defendant C. AHSANI also conspired with others to bribe certain
officials at SOE-3 to ensure that Company 3 won Kazakhstan Project 1A. For
example, on or about June 17, 2003, Intermediary Company entered into a sub-
agency agreement with a âsub-agentâ company, in which Intermediary Company

agreed to pay the âsub-agentâ approximately 0.44% of the value of the Kazakhstan

22
Case 4:19-cr-00147 Documentis Filed on 03/04/19 in TXSD Page 23 0f 56

Project 1A contract award. At the same time, Defendant C. AHSANI caused
Intermediary Company to enter into a âside letterâ agreement with the âsub-agentâ
providing that payments to the âsub-agentâ would only continue if three specific
government officials in Kazakhstan remained in their positions in the government.
Defendant C. AHSANI and others executed this âside letterâ because they
understood that portions of Intermediary Companyâs payments to the âsub-agentâ
would be used to pay bribes to these three government officials in Kazakhstan.

60. Defendant C. AHSANI further conspired with others to make bribe
payments, including payments of cash and a vehicle, to âKazakh Official 2,â a
high-ranking official at SOE-3 whose identity is known to the United States and
Defendants, in exchange for Kazakh Official 2âs agreement to use Kazakh Official
2âs authority within SOE-3 to authorize the award of Kazakhstan Project 1A to
Company 3.

61. On or about May 26, 2004, the government of Kazakhstan awarded
Kazakhstan Project 1A to Company 3.

62. In addition to the above, Defendant C. AHSANT, and at times
Defendant S. AHSANI, and others, acting within the scope of their agency and
other agreements and for the benefit of Intermediary Company and Intermediary
Companyâs client companies, conspired with others, including certain client

company executives and employees, to pay bribes, promise to pay bribes, offer to

23
Case 4:19-cr-00147 Documentis Filed on 03/04/19 in TXSD Page 24 of 56

pay bribes, and authorize the payment of bribes to at least five foreign government
officials in Kazakhstan, including within SOE-3 and SOE-4, in order to obtain the
following additional projects:

a. In or around and between 2003 and 2009, and in conspiracy
with certain executives and employees at SBM, at least one sub-contract to
Kazakhstan Project 1 for SBM and a joint venture partner;

b. In or around and between 2003 and 2010, and in conspiracy
with certain executives and employees at Company 7, at least seven sub-projects to
Kazakhstan Project 1 and at least one other oil and gas project for Company 7.
Among other things, Defendants C. AHSANI, S. AHSANI, and others also
undertook affirmative steps to conceal the bribes paid and promised to be paid on
behalf of Company 7, which included Defendant S. AHSANI coordinating with a
high-ranking executive at Company 7 to maintain a double set of books and
records to disguise Intermediary Companyâs bribery payments on behalf of
Company 7 as legitimate transactions;

c. In or around and between 2004 and 2006, and in conspiracy
with certain executives and employees at Company 6, at least one sub-project to

Kazakhstan Project 1 for Company 6;

24
Case 4:19-cr-00147 Documentis Filed on 03/04/19 in TXSD Page 25 of 56

d. In or around and between 2004 and 2010, and in conspiracy
with certain executives and employees at Rolls-Royce and Company 21, at least
one sub-project to Kazakhstan Project 1 for Rolls-Royce and Company 21;

â¬. In or around 2005, and in conspiracy with certain executives
and employees at Company 4, at least one sub-project to Kazakhstan Project 1 for
Company 4;

f. In or around and between 2005 and 2008, and in conspiracy
with certain executives and employees at Company 3, at least two additional sub-
projects to Kazakhstan Project 1 for Company 3;

g. _In or around and between 2005 and 2008, and in conspiracy
with certain executives and employees at Company 13, at least two sub-projects to
Kazakhstan Project 1 for Company 13;

h. In or around and between 2005 and 2010, and in conspiracy
with certain executives and employees at Company 14, at least eight contracts in
connection with a major oil and gas project in Kazakhstan for Company 14. In
furtherance of the conspiracy, Defendants C. AHSANI and S. AHSANI agreed
amongst themselves and with others, including CC-6, to pay kickbacks to an
executive at one of the companies in the Company 14 partnership;

i. In or around and between 2006 and 2009, and in conspiracy

with certain executives and employees at Company 19, at least one sub-project to

25
Case 4:19-cr-00147 Documentis Filed on 03/04/19 in TXSD Page 26 of 56

Kazakhstan Project 1 for a joint venture between Company 19 and another
company; and
j. In or around and between 2009 and 2013, and in conspiracy
with certain executives and employees at Company 20, at least three sub-projects
to Kazakhstan Project 1 for Company 20. In furtherance of the corrupt conspiracy,
Defendants C. AHSANI, S. AHSANI, and others paid kickbacks to an executive
at Company 20.
Algeria

63. In Algeria, Defendants C. AHSANI and S. AHSANI conspired with
others, including certain executives and employees at client companies of
Intermediary Company, to pay bribes, promise to pay bribes, offer to pay bribes,
and authorize the payment of bribes to foreign government officials, including at
SOE-S, in order to obtain improper business advantages and to obtain and retain
business for Intermediary Company and its co-conspirator client companies,
including, but not limited to, Company 2, Company 15, Company 16, and
Company 18. Defendants C. AHSANI and S. AHSANT also conspired with others
to engage in other corrupt conduct such as bid-rigging, paying kickbacks, and
laundering the proceeds of the corrupt schemes.

64. For example, beginning by at least in or around November 2010,

executives at Company 2 contacted executives of Intermediary Company about

26
Case 4:19-cr-00147 Documentis Filed on 03/04/19 in TXSD Page 27 of 56

assistance for work in Algeria. In or about early 2011, Defendant C. AHSANI
received a âpanickedâ phone call from a Company 2 executive who said that the
Company 2 executive had promised to pay one or more individuals who had
assisted Company 2 in obtaining a contract from SOE-5. The Company 2
executive told Defendant C. AHSANI that Company 2 needed to make this
payment, and that if the payment were not made, Company 2 would have
âproblemsâ with the SOE-5 contract. The Company 2 executive asked Defendant
C. AHSANT if Intermediary Company would agree to make the payment on behalf
of Company 2. Defendant C. AHSANI believed that the Company 2 executive
was asking him to pay a bribe.

65. In or around June 2011, Defendants C. AHSANI, S. AHSANT, and
others caused Intermediary Company to enter into a âSales Consultant Agreementâ
with Company 2. As part of the arrangement, Defendant C. AHSANI agreed with
others, including two executives of Company 2, that Company 2 would pay
$300,000 to Intermediary Company, and that Intermediary Company would
perform no services for Company 2, except that Intermediary Company would pass
on a portion of the $300,000 payment to a shell company that had itself performed
no work for Intermediary Company or Company 2.

66. On or about February 22, 2012, Company 2 transferred $300,000

from a bank account in Belgium, through a correspondent account in the United

27
Case 4:19-cr-00147 Documentis Filed on 03/04/19 in TXSD Page 28 of 56

States, on to an Intermediary Company bank account in Monaco. In or about and
between October 25, 2012 and December 31, 2012, Defendants C. AHSANI and
S. AHSANI caused Intermediary Company to transfer approximately $170,000
from an Intermediary Company bank account in the United Arab Emirates, through
a correspondent account in the United States, on to the shell company bank
account in the United Kingdom.

67. In addition to the above, Defendants C. AHSANI, S. AHSANI, and
others, acting within the scope of their agency and other agreements and for the
benefit of Intermediary Company and Intermediary Companyâs client companies,
conspired with others, including certain client company executives and employees,
to pay bribes, promise to pay bribes, offer to pay bribes, and authorize the payment
of bribes to government officials in Algeria, including within SOE-5, in order to
obtain the following additional projects:

a. In or around 2008, and in conspiracy with certain executives
and employees at Company 15, Company 16, and Company 17, in order to win
certain projects for Company 15 and Company 16. Among other things,
Defendants C. AHSANI, S. AHSANT, and others, conspired with executives at
Company 15, Company 16, and Company 17 to rig the bid on the two projects to
ensure that Company 15 won one project and that Company 16 won the other. In

furtherance of this agreement, Defendants C. AHSANI, S. AHSANTI, and others,

28
Case 4:19-cr-00147 Documentis Filed on 03/04/19 in TXSD Page 29 of 56

paid Company 17 to compensate Company 17 for deliberately losing the bid; and
paid kickbacks to an executive of Company 15 and paid kickbacks to a consultant
for Company 17; and
b. In or around and between 2009 and 2014, and in conspiracy
with certain executives and employees of Company 18, in order to obtain certain
contracts supplying spare parts to SOE-5 for Company 18. In furtherance of this
and other schemes, Defendants C. AHSANI, 8S. AHSANI, and others paid
kickbacks to an executive of Company 18.
Libya

68. In Libya, Defendants C. AHSANI and S. AHSANI, conspired with
others, including certain executives and employees at client companies of
Intermediary Company, to pay bribes, promise to pay bribes, offer to pay bribes,
and authorize the payment of bribes to foreign government officials in Libya,
including at SOE-6, in order to obtain improper business advantages and to obtain
and retain business for Intermediary Company and its co-conspirator client
companies, including, but not limited to, Company 10, Company 11, Company 12,
Company 23, and Company 24. Defendants C. AHSANI and S. AHSANT also
conspired with others to engage in other corrupt conduct such as paying kickbacks
to executives and laundering the proceeds of the corrupt bribery and kickback

schemes.

29
Case 4:19-cr-00147 Documentis Filed on 03/04/19 in TXSD Page 30 of 56

69. For example, in or around May 2006, Company 10 entered into an
âAgency Agreementâ appointing Intermediary Company as its agent in attempting
to secure the award of âLibya Project 1,â a design and construction project that is
known to the United States and Defendants. Thereafter, Defendant S. AHSANI
conspired with others, including CC-5, to promise to pay âLibya Official 1,â an
individual whose identity is known to the United States and the Defendants, in
exchange for Libya Official 1âs agreement to assist Intermediary Company and
Company 10 in obtaining the contract award for Libya Project 1. While Defendant
S. AHSANI, CC-5, and others understood that Libya Official 1 was not an
appointed Libyan government official at the time they promised to pay Libya
Official 1, Defendant S. AHSANI, CC-5, and others, believed Libya Official 1
could exert influence over senior Libyan government officials, including one
official who was a close relative of the then-head of the Libyan government, and
that this senior Libya officialâs support or lack of support could determine whether
Company 10 and its subsidiaries won the award for Libya Project 1. At the time,
Defendants C. AHSANI and 8. AHSANI also agreed to pay the bribe because
they understood that Libya Official 1 could potentially use Libya Official 1âs
influence to steer other Libyan government contracts to Intermediary Company

and its co-conspirator clients.

30
Case 4:19-cr-00147 Documentis Filed on 03/04/19 in TXSD Page SL of $6

70. In or around October 2006, the Libyan government awarded Libya
Project 1 to Company 10.

71. After Libya Project 1 was awarded to Company 10, and in furtherance
of the corrupt arrangement, Defendants C. AHSANI, S. AHSANI, and others paid
$250,000 to a shell company they believed to be held in the name of a relative of
Libya Official 1, who by this time had an official title in the Libyan government.

72. Later, in or around 2009, Company 10 and Intermediary Company
had a contract dispute, which led Company 10 to stop making contractual
payments. In order to induce Company 10 to continue their payments to
Intermediary Company, Defendants C. AHSANI and 8S. AHSANI agreed to pay
two executives at Company 10 kickbacks valued at approximately $100,000 each.

73.  Inaddition to the above, Defendants C. AHSANI and S. AHSANI,
acting within the scope of their agency and other agreements and for the benefit of
Intermediary Company and Intermediary Companyâs client companies, conspired
with others, including certain client company executives and employees, to pay
bribes, promise to pay bribes, offer to pay bribes, and authorize the payment of
bribes to government officials in Libya, including at SOE-6, in order to obtain the

following additional projects:

31
Case 4:10-cr-00147 Documentis Filed on 03/04/19 in TXSD Page 32 of 56

a. In or around and between 2008 and 2011, and in conspiracy
with certain executives at Company 23 and Company 24, at least one project for
Company 23 and Company 24;

b. In or around and between 2009 and 2010, and in conspiracy
with certain executives and employees at Company 12, at least one project for
Company 12. In furtherance of the corrupt conspiracy, Defendants C. AHSANI
and S. AHSANI, and others, paid kickbacks to an executive at Company 12; and

c. In or around 2010, and in conspiracy with certain executives
and employees at Company 11, at least one project for Company 11.

Concealment and Obstruction

74. Beginning in or around 2006 and continuing until in or around 2016,
Defendants C. AHSANI and S. AHSANI conspired with others to conceal the
ongoing bribery and money laundering schemes on behalf of Intermediary
Company and its co-conspirator client companies. Among other things,
Defendants C. AHSANI, S. AHSANI, and others used code words when
communicating with others about the corrupt scheme, made false statements over
international wires to the United States to obtain necessary compliance
certifications, caused false statements to be made in official proceedings, and took
efforts to conceal the discovery of incriminating information by law enforcement

in the United States and elsewhere.

32
Case 4:19-cr-00147 Documentis Filed on 03/04/19 in TXSD Page 33 of 56

75. For example, Defendants C. AHSANI and S. AHSANI conspired
with others to make false statements, through interstate and international wire
communications, to âDue Diligence Organization,â an anti-bribery organization
headquartered in the United States whose identity is known to the United States
and the Defendants. Due Diligence Organization offered companies due diligence
services, including screenings and certifications, which were designed to signal
whether a company had met certain anticorruption standards.

76. Beginning in or around 2006, Rolls-Royceâs compliance department
initiated a new control that required all sales agents to undergo Due Diligence
Organizationâs screening and obtain a compliance certification. In order to obtain
Due Diligence Organizationâs certification and continue doing business with Rolls-
Royce and RRESI, Defendants C. AHSANI, S. AHSANI, and others agreed to
cause materially false and misleading information to be transmitted, through
interstate and international wire, to Due Diligence Organization in the United
States, including false statements that Intermediary Company was not involved in
the payment of bribes to foreign government officials. Further, Defendants
C. AHSANI, S. AHSANI, and others provided Due Diligence Organization with
business references, including executives at Company 3, Company 7, and
Company 18, who knew that Intermediary Company paid bribes to win business

for Company 3, Company 7, and Company 18, respectively. Defendants

33
Case 4:19-cr-00147 Documentis Filed on 03/04/19 in TXSD Page 34 of 56

C. AHSANI, S. AHSANI, and others caused Intermediary Company to submit
false statements so that Intermediary Company could continue to maintain Due
Diligence Organizationâs certifications until at least in or around 2015.
| 77. Additionally, in or around June and July of 2011, Defendant

C. AHSANL S. AHSANI and others learned that a foreign law enforcement
agency had begun investigating a co-conspirator. In response, Defendants

C. AHSANI, S. AHSANI, and others caused over 250,000 potentially
incriminating emails and other documents on Intermediary Companyâs system to
be archived. Thereafter, Defendants C. AHSANI, S. AHSANI, and others caused
the archived documents to be relocated from Intermediary Companyâs offices in
Monaco to Lebanon and the United Arab Emirates.

78. On or about March 29, 2016, several media outlets began reporting
that Defendants C. AHSANI, S. AHSANI, and others had participated in a long-
running bribery scheme at Intermediary Company, and the news reports included
excerpts from the archived documents identified in Paragraph 77. The Defendants
learned that multiple law enforcement agencies, including law enforcement in the
United States, were conducting investigations into Intermediary Companyâs
bribery scheme. Thereafter, in or around the summer of 2016, Defendants

C. AHSANI, S. AHSANI, and others destroyed incriminating documents with the

34
Case 4:10-cr-00147 Documentis Filed on 03/04/19 in TXSD Page 35 of 56

intent to prevent their discovery by law enforcement agents in the United States,
the United Kingdom, Australia, and elsewhere.
