of the Macau Real Estate Development Company | in or about late
|

August 2015. At this forum, NG continued to press his goal of

obtaining Formal UN Support for the Macau Conference Center.

The forum was attended by the Ambassadors and various other

Giplomats and UN officials, who were provided with, among other

things, free iPads and/or other things of value. NG, with the
{
|

assistance of YIN, also provided a UNOSSC official,

approximately two weeks before the forum, with an interest-free

 

loan. Following the forum, NG, with the assistance of YIN,
continued the scheme by agreeing to make additional payments to
each of the Ambassadors. |

16. During the course of the scheme, rer C. YIN, a/k/a
âJeff Chuan,â a/k/a âYin Chuan,â the defendant , agreed to assist
|
and assisted the Dominican Ambassador in concealing portions of
the Dominican Ambassador's income from the Internal Revenue
Service (âIRSâ). YIN also took steps to conceal portions of
YIN'âs own income from the IRS and to evade paying his own income
taxes. Among other things, YIN caused NGO-1 to pay him with
checks payable to cash and provided false and/or misleading
|

information to his accountant with respect |to YINâs income.
