Overview of the Criminal Schemes

7. PARRIS, MIREMBE, and their co-conspirators engaged in, among other things, a
criminal scheme to offer and pay bribes to Ugandan judges, Ugandan welfare officers, and other
Ugandan officials to corruptly procure adoptions of Ugandan children in order to assist Adoption
Agency with obtaining business and with directing business to Adoption Agency, MIREMBE, and

others. PARRIS, MIREMBE, and their co-conspirators also lied to, and concealed material

 
a: D2 O-crfi0424-SO Doc #1 Filed: OS/t

   

information from, Adoption Agency clientsâincluding concealing facts relating to the
circumstances of the children to be adopted and concealing that the adoptions were procured
through bribery and fraudâin order to obtain money from Adoption Agency clients. PARRIS,
MIREMBE, and their co-conspirators also caused Adoption Agencyâs clients to submit fraudulent
visa applications to the United States Department of State (the âState Departmentâ) in connection
with certain adoptions. .

8. PARRIS, COLE, and their co-conspirators engaged in, among other things, a
criminal scheme to deceive authorities in the United States responsible for regulating intercountry
adoptions about a scheme to transfer a child from Poland to PARRISâs relatives without verifying
that PARRISâs relatives were eligible for intercountry adoption. COLE also lied to the Polish

âauthority responsible for intercountry adoptions about the transfer of the child to PARRISâs
relatives in an attempt to maintain Adoption Agencyâs ability to procure intercountry adoptions
from Poland.â

Relevant Laws and Regulations

9. The Intercountry Adoption Act (âIAAâ) made it a crime for any person to
knowingly and willfully make a false statement or misrepresentation about a material fact that is
intended to influence a decision or action of an accrediting entity or an entity performing a central
authority function in the United States or a foreign country. 42 U.S.C. Section 14944.

10, Adoption regulations further required that adoption agencies: (1) ensure that
intercountry adoptions take place in the best interests of children; and (2) prevent the abduction,
exploitation, sale, or trafficking of children. 22 C.F.R. Section 96.35.

ll. The State Department had primary responsibility for adjudicating the visa

applications of children coming to the United, States in intercountry adoption. Through the visa

 
Case: LipO-cr-00424-S0 Doc #1 Filled: 68/1

 

application review process, the State Department obtained information about how U.S. adoption
agencies facilitated intercountry adoptions from Uganda, Poland, and elsewhere. The State
Department could use this information to evaluate whether adoption agencies were complying with
applicable regulations, as appropriate.

12. The FCPA makes it unlawful for certain classes of persons and entities to act
corruptly in furtherance of an offer, promise, authorization, or payment of money or anything of
value to a foreign government official for the purpose of influencing foreign officials, inducing
foreign officials to take or omit certain acts, and securing an improper advantage in order to assist
those classes of persons in obtaining or retaining business for, or directing business to, any person.
15 U.S.C, Section 78dd-1, et seq.

Eligibility for Intercountry Adoption in Uganda

13. Ugandan laws provided, among other things, that children should only be separated
from their parents when a court determined that doing so would be beneficial to the child.
Probation and social welfare officers (âwelfare officersâ) in Uganda were responsible for
identifying vulnerable children and, when appropriate, applying for judicial âcare ordersâ that
would authorize persons other than a childâs parents to care for the child. To support a care order
application, welfare officers were required to interview the childâs parents, nearest relatives or
guardians and then submit a wtitten âwelfare reportâ describing why the child was vulnerable.

14. Magistrate Judges of the Family and Childrenâs Court of Uganda (âMagistrate
Judgesâ) were required to review the welfare report and determine whether to issue a care order

placing the child into an orphanage.

 
 

a: D2 O-crfi0424-SO Doc #1 Filed: O8/13/20 5 of 44.

   

Intercountry Adoption from Uganda to the United States

15. Prospective adoptive parents from the United States that sought to adopt Ugandan
orphans could do so by obtaining a guardianship order from the Family Division of the High Court
of Uganda (âUgandan High Courtâ), obtaining a visa to bring the child to the United States, and
then bringing the child to the United States to complete the adoption. At the Ugandan High Court,
the court registrar was responsible for assigning each guardianship application to a judge.

16. Guardianship applicants provided written submissions, including the welfare report
and care order, to support their applications. Ugandan High Court judges held hearings to
adjudicate guardianship applications and issued guardianship orders in writing. Once a
prospective adoptive parent obtained a guardianship order, he or she would then apply to the State
Department for an IR4 visa to bring the child to the United States. The prospective adoptive parent .
was typically interviewed at the U.S. Embassy in Kampala, Uganda in connection with their
prospective adopteeâs visa applications. The prospective adoptive parent was required, among
other things, to provide truthful information about the circumstances by which the child was
determined to be an orphan.

Details of the Uganda Criminal Schemes

17. In or around 2012, Adoption Agency started a program to facilitate adoptions of
Ugandan children by prospective adoptive parents in the United States. From at least 2012 to in
or around 2016, PARRIS managed Adoption Agencyâs adoption program in Uganda in
coordination with Longoria and others.

18. In or around 2013, Adoption Agency entered into an agreement with MIREMBE
to provide adoption-related services to Adoption Agency. PARRIS selected MIREMBE for this

role as Adoption Agencyâs foreign supervised provider in Uganda. Adoption Agency, through

 
 

a: D2 O-crf10424-SO Doc #1 Filed: OS/13/20 6 of 44.

   

PARRIS and others, communicated frequently with MIREMBE about her work for Adoption
Agency while it was in progress and provided her with instructions regarding the intercountry
adoptions that she was facilitating for Adoption Agency clients. Adoption Agency, through
PARRIS and others, directed its clients in the Uganda program to hire MIREMBE as their attorney
for adoption-related proceedings. Adoption Agency, through PARRIS and others, also supervised
MIREMBEâs work, including by requiring her to provide detailed descriptions of the services she
performed before receiving payment. Furthermore, federal regulations required Adoption Agency
to adequately supervise MIREMBE or risk being debarred by the State Department.

19. Between in or around 2013 and in or around 2016, PARRIS, MIREMBE, and others
participated in criminal schemes (1) to bribe Ugandan government officials in order to corruptly
procure adoptions of Ugandan children who PARRIS and MIREMBE knew had not been properly
determined to be orphans or otherwise to be eligible for intercountry adoption; (2) to make material
misrepresentations and to conceal material facts from Adoption Agency clients in order to obtain
money from Adoption Agency clients, including, among other things, to conceal from Adoption
Agency clients facts relating to the circumstances of the children to be adopted and the fact that
PARRIS, MIREMBE, and their co-conspirators were procuring these adoptions through bribery
and other improper means; (3) to wire money from the United States to Uganda, in part, to provide
money for the bribes; and (4) to cause Adoption Agencyâs clients to submit fraudulent visa
applications in connection with these adoptions. Many of the Ugandan children whose adoptions
PARRIS and MIREMBE had procured through bribery and fraud were not properly determined to
be orphans, and certain of the children were ultimately returned to their birth mothers in Uganda
after Adoption Agencyâs clients came to believe that these birth mothers had not knowingly given

their children up for adoption. During this same period, Adoption Agency, in collaboration with

 

 
 

Case: LipO-cr-00424-S0 Doc 1 Filled: O8/13feÂ¢

 

MIREMBE, procured the adoption of more than 30 Ugandan children by U.S. clients. Adoption
Agency received more than $900,000 from these clients. MIREMBE received more than $430,000
from Adoption Agency, as well as tens of thousands of dollars directly from Adoption Agencyâs
clients for representing them in Uganda.
PARRIS, MIREMBE, and their Co-Conspirators bribe Ugandan officials

20. PARRIS, MIREMBE, and their co-conspirators presented Ugandan children who
had not yet been determined to be orphans to Adoption Agencyâs clients for potential adoption.
PARRIS then authorized Adoption Agency to send funds to MIREMBE, knowing that MIREMBE
would use these funds, in part, to bribe Ugandan government officials to corruptly cause the
adoptions of these children. These bribes included bribes to the following individuals, each of
whom was a âforeign officialâ as that term is used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code,
Sections 78dd-2(h)(2)(A): (1) bribes to a welfare officer, so that the welfare officer would
recommend that children be placed into orphanages without first ensuring that the children were
actually orphaned or that putting them up-for adoption was in their best interest; (2) bribes to a
Ugandan magistrate judge, so that the magistrate judge would issue care orders based on the
corruptly procured welfare reports and place the children in an orphanage in the Kampala district
of Uganda (âKampala Orphanage Aâ) that was willing to accept the children without inquiring
into whether they were actually orphans; (3) bribes to court registrars to get them to assign cases
to corrupt âadoption-friendlyâ judges; and (4) bribes to Ugandan High Court judges to obtain
guardianship orders to permit Adoption Agencyâs clients to bring the children to the United States
for adoption.

21. For example, MIREMBE and others working at MIREMBEâs direction used

money from Adoption Agency to pay bribes to a welfare officer in the Kayunga district of Uganda
 

Case: LipO-cr-00424-S0 Doct: 1 Filed: O8/13feÂ¢ Pp.

 

(âKayunga Welfare Officer 1â) in exchange for Kayunga Welfare Officer 1 signing welfare reports
that recommended placing children into an orphanage. These corruptly procured welfare reports
were not based on Kayunga Welfare Officer 1âs independent determinations that these children
had to be placed in an orphanage. Rather, as PARRIS and MIREMBE knew and intended,
Kayunga Welfare Officer 1 provided welfare reports for these children because MIREMBE and
people working at MIREMBEâs direction brought the children to Kayunga Welfare Officer 1 and
paid bribes to Kayunga Welfare Officer 1 t6 corruptly obtain the welfare reports.

22. MIREMBE, at times assisted by employees of Law Firm A who were working at
her direction, drafted welfare reports and directed the employees to deliver them to Kayunga
Welfare Officer 1. Kayunga Welfare Officer | signed the welfare reports prepared by MIREMBE
and the Law Firm A employees upon receiving cash bribes. These welfare reports at times falsely
overstated the childrenâs need for care and orphan status. For example, one welfare report falsely
and fraudulently stated that the whereabouts of a childâs father were unknown.

23. In many instances, these welfare reports also often recommended that the children
be placed in âKampala Orphanage A,â even though it was in the Kampala district of Uganda,
which was approximately two hours away from the Kayunga districtâthe district that the children
were from and where there were available orphanages. -MIREMBE steered the children to
Kampala Orphanage A because MIREMBE knew that the director of Kampala Orphanage A
would accept the children without scrutinizing whether the children had any alternatives for care.
MIREMBE also steered the children to Kampala Orphanage A because the director of Kampala
Orphanage A was willing to sign affidavits drafted by MIREMBE for submission to the Ugandan

High Court without questioning them.

 

 
 

Case: LipO-cr-00424-S0 Doct: 1 Filed: O8/13feÂ¢ Pp.

 

24. PARRIS, MIREMBE and their co-conspirators caused Adoption Agency to wire
funds from the Adoption Agencyâs Ohio-based account to bank accounts controlled by MIREMBE
in Uganda for the purpose of promoting the bribery scheme and knowing that the funds would be
used, in part, to fund the bribes to Ugandan officials. .

PARRIS, MIREMBE, and their Co-Conspirators provide false information to, and conceal
material information from, Adoption Agencyâs clients

25. PARRIS and MIREMBE and their co-conspirators took steps to conceal, among
other things: (1) the bribery scheme; (2) the fees associated with the bribery scheme that were
charged to Adoption Agency clients; and (3) other material facts from Adoption Agencyâs clients
in order to obtain money from Adoption Agency clients.

26. For example, Adoption Agency sent invoices via email to Adoption Agency clients
that falsely and fraudulently concealed the bribes to court registrars as âcourt filing fees.â
MIREMBE, and Law Firm A employees working at MIREMBEâs direction, also sent invoices to
Adoption Agency via email thatâ-as PARRIS, MIREMBE and their co-conspirators knewâ
falsely described bribes to Ugandan Judges as âjudgeâs fees.â

27. In or about October 2015, an Adoption Agency client asked PARRIS and others
the reason Adoption Agency charged the client a âcourt filing fee.â The client was not told the
truth.

28. Subsequently, in order to better conceal the money that Adoption Agency clients
were being charged in order to fund the bribery scheme, PARRIS, and her co-conspirators began
concealing the cost of the bribes within the âForeign Program Feesâ that were charged to Adoption
Agencyâs clients. Adoption Agency clients in the Uganda program were often charged more than

$10,000 each in âForeign Program Fees.â

 
ease: Liz0-cr-00424-S0 Doc#i 1 Filed: 08/13/20 LO of 44, P

   

29. PARRIS, MIREMBE, and their co-conspirators also deceived Adoption Agencyâs
clients about the circumstances of the children to be adopted, including by providing Adoption
Agency clients with fraudulent welfare reports that were corruptly procured and by concealing that
the children were not properly determined to be eligible for intercountry adoption.

30. Â° For example, on or about October 14, 2014, PARRIS called an Adoption Agency
client and informed the client that a certain child was potentially available for adoption, even
though PARRIS knew the child was not eligible to be referred for adoption at that time. In or
around February 2015, Adoption Agency sent a referral package via email to the Adoption Agency
client that included the childâs welfare report, which had been corruptly procured through bribery.
The corruptly obtained welfare report falsely stated that the childâs mother âis helpless [and]
cannot provide the basic needs of the child.â The referral package also included a copy of a care
order signed by a magistrate judge that was also corruptly obtained through bribery, and which
recommended that the child be placed in the care of Kampala Orphanage A.

31. After the Adoption Agency client completed the adoption of the child, and while
the child was living in the Adoption Agency clientâs home in the United States, the Adoption
Agency client came to believe that certain information she had received in the welfare report was
false and that the: childâs birth mother had not knowingly given the child up for adoption. The
Adoption Agency Client coordinated with an individual residing in Uganda, who traveled to the
childâs home village on or about March 25, 2016, seeking additional information regarding the
childâs true background. PARRIS learned of this visit and called Adoption Agency client within
approximately one day. PARRIS told the client, in sum and substance, that the client should not
further inquire about the childâs background and that the client was putting at risk Adoption

Agencyâs ability to facilitate additional adoptions from the childâs village. Following this phone

10

 

 

 

 

 
ease: Liz0-cr-00424-S0 Doc#i 1 Filed: 08/13/20 Ll of 44. P

   

call, the client obtained the services of a social worker in the United States to assess the childâs
best interests.

32. In or around September 2016, the Adoption Agency client traveled with the child
to Uganda, reunited the child with the childâs birth mother, and relinquished parental rights over
the child back to the childâs birth mother. In total, in connection with the adoption of the child,
the Adoption Agency client made three trips to Uganda, paid approximately $25,000 to Adoption
Agency, paid more than $10,000 dollars to MIREMBE, paid more than $5,000 to an individual
affiliated with MIREMBE and Law Firm A, and incurred thousands of dollars in additional
expenses, including expenses to obtain social work services and legal services in the United States.

PARRIS misrepresents and conceals additional
material information from an Adoption Agency client

33. In or around August 2015, PARRIS referred a Ugandan child to an Adoption
Agency client for potential adoption. PARRIS falsely informed the Adoption Agency client that
the child had not been adopted by another Adoption Agency client solely because the child wanted
to be adopted into a home with a mother and a father, and PARRIS concealed from the Adoption
Agency client, among other things: (1) that the other Adoption Agency client had adopted the
childâs sibling, but had chosen to abandon the child in Uganda after having obtained a guardianship
order establishing custody over the child and spending weeks living with the child and the childâs
sibling in Uganda; and (2) that the welfare report for the child had been corruptly obtained through
bribery.

34. On or about December 28, 2015, PARRIS caused an Adoption Agency employee
to send the Adoption Agency client an email, which, among other things, included the corruptly

obtained welfare report as an attachment and requested that the Adoption Agency client pay

ll

 

 
ease: Liz0-cr-00424-S0 Doc #1 Filed: 08/13/20 12 of 44, P

   

Adoption Agency $10,010 in connection with the adoption of the child, including $9,335 for the
âForeign Program Fee.â

35. Onor about December 31, 2015, the Adoption Agency Client mailed a check from
West Virginia to Adoption Agencyâs office in Strongsville, Ohio in the amount of $10,010.
Adoption Agency deposited this check into the Adoption Agencyâs Ohio-based account on or
about January 4, 2016.

36. The Adoption Agency client traveled to Uganda in or around March 2016 to pursue
the adoption of the child. By that time, the Adoption Agency client had already paid Adoption
Agency approximately $26,000 in connection with this potential adoption. While in Uganda, the
Adoption Agency Client learned that she had been misled by PARRIS about the circumstances
under which the child had become available for adoption.

37. In or around September 2016, the Adoption Agency learned that the Adoption â
Agency client described in Paragraphs 30 through 32 had repatriated a Ugandan adoptee to Uganda
based on concerns that the childâs birth mother was manipulated into giving her child up for
adoption. PARRIS was concerned that other Adoption Agency clients would do so as well, and
that the repatriations would harm Adoption Agencyâs reputation. In October 2016, Longoria tried
to arrange a telephone call between PARRIS and the Adoption Agency client. Longoria wrote,
â(PARRIS] and I received some information this morning from Uganda that we need to share and
discuss with you.â The Adoption agency client responded by asking Longoria to put any
information in writing. Longoria wrote to PARRIS, âAre you going to write to [the Adoption

Agency client]?â PARRIS responded, âNo donât want to put on paper.â

38. In or around November 2016, the Adoption Agency client repatriated the child to
Uganda based on concerns that the childâs birth mother was manipulated into giving her child up
for adoption.

PARRIS, MIREMBE, and their Co-Conspirators cause their clients to submit false information to
the State Department to conceal their marketing of children who have not been properly
determined to be eligible for intercountry adoption

39. PARRIS, MIREMBE, and others also conspired to cause Adoption Agencyâs
clients to provide false information and to submit false documents to the State Department,
including the submission of corruptly obtained fraudulent welfare reports, in order to obtain the
visas necessary to bring the adoptive.children to the United States.

40. For example, in or around May 2015, PARRIS, MIREMBE, and their co-
conspirators caused the Adoption Agency client described in paragraphs 30 to 32 to submit the
false and corruptly obtained welfare report to the State Department in order to procure an IR4 visa
for the child.

41, In another example, PARRIS, MIREMBE, and their co-conspirators created, and
caused to be created, a welfare report for a child that falsely identified the wrong person as the
childâs birth mother and falsely stated that the childâs biological father was deceased. MIREMBE
further attempted to get an Adoption Agency client to submit to the State Department, in
connection with obtaining an IR4 visa for the child, documents that falsely indicated that the
correct birth mother for the child had been identified at the time that the Adoption Agency referred

the child to the Adoption Agency client. PARRIS, in sum and substance, recommended that the

13

 
6) LiO-cr-00424-SO Doc#i 1 Filed: 08/13/20 14 of 44, Pes

   

Adoption Agency client allow MIREMBE to submit the false documents to the State Department
as part of the visa application.

42. In another example, on or about May 19, 2015, MIREMBE emailed PARRIS and
Longoria and instructed them to create false documents in association with an IR4 visa application
to be submitted to the State Department by an Adoption Agency client because otherwise âit will
be problematic at embassy.â In response to the request, Longoria created documents falsely
representing the date upon which Adoption Agency referred the child to the client in order to
conceal the short amount of time child had been in the orphanage before being referred for
intercountry adoption. Longoria, in coordination with PARRIS, provided the false and fraudulent
documents to the client, and, on or about July 30, 2015, MIREMBE caused the client to submit
the false and fraudulent documents to the State Department as part the visa application.

Intercountry Adoption from Poland to the United States

43.  Atall times relevant to this Indictment, the Council on Accreditation (âCOAâ) was
the entity responsible for accrediting any agency in the United States that sought to provide
intercountry adoption services. COA required accredited adoption agencies to provide annual
certifications attesting that they were in substantial compliance with applicable regulations, and to
timely report certain events, including dissolved adoptions and abuse of adoptees. COA also could
suspend or cancel an adoption agencyâs accreditation to facilitate intercountry adoptionsâif it was
out of compliance with applicable laws, regulations, policies, or procedures.

44. The Ministry of Family, Labor, and Social Policy (the âPolish Central Authorityâ)
was the Polish government agency that determined, among other things, whether an adoption
service provider was permitted to facilitate intercountry adoptions in Poland. For each

intercountry adoption from Poland, adoption service providers were required to transmit a home

14

 

 

 
ease: Liz0-cr-00424-S0 Doc#i 1 Filed: 08/13/20 15 0f 44, P

   

study of prospective adoptive parents, which included a criminal background check on all adults
living in the home, to the Polish Central Authority. The State Department was also required to
send a letter to. the Polish Central Authority indicating its approval for particular United States
prospective adoptive parents to adopt particular Polish children. The State Department also had
to approve a visa for the prospective adoptee to be brought to the United States for adoption.

45. Adoption service providers were obligated to report any disruption or dissolution
of an intercountry adoption to the Council on Accreditation within 30 business days. Adoption
service providers were also required to report any disruption of an intercountry adoption from
Poland to the Polish Central Authority.

Details of the Poland Criminal Scheme

46. Adoption Agency had established an adoption program in Poland in or around
2014. The Poland program was an important potential revenue source for COLE and Adoption
Agency.

47. Poland Client was a client of Adoption Agency who transferred into Adoption
Agencyâs Poland program in or around 2015. Poland Client originally expressed a preference to
adopt one child. In or around early 2015, after Adoption Agency informed Poland Client about
the potential of adopting two siblings (Child | and Child 2), Poland Client initially agreed to adopt
both siblings.

48. On or about March 4, 2015, the State Department sent a letter to the Polish Central
Authority that indicated the State Departmentâs approval for Poland Client to adopt Child 1 and
Child 2. The Polish Central Authority also received the completed home study for Poland Client

that showed Poland Clientâs suitability to complete an intercountry adoption.

15
ease: Liz0-cr-00424-S0 Doc#i 1 Filed: 08/13/20 16 of 44, P

   

49. Â° In or around May 2015, Poland Client traveled to Poland. In Poland, Co-
Conspirator 1 was introduced to Poland Client as Adoption Agencyâs in-country representative.
Over the course of weeks in Poland with Child 1 and Child 2, Poland Client developed concerns
as to whether Poland Client could adequately meet the physical and emotional needs of both
siblings. Poland Client expressed that concern to Co-Conspirator 1. In response, Co-Conspirator
1 told Poland Client that if Poland Client did not adopt both siblings, they would be âred-markedâ
and unlikely to be adopted by anyone else. Co-Conspirator 1, in sum and substance, also told
Poland Client to adopt both siblings and then, once in the United States, find another family in the
United States to adopt Child 2.

50. At around the time that Co-Conspirator 1 pressured Poland Client to adopt both
siblings, Adoption Agency had approximately 40 pending clients in the Poland program. These
pending clients represented more than $1 million of potential revenue to Adoption Agency, and
hundreds of thousands of dollars of potential revenue to Co-Conspirator 1âs company.

51. Poland Client contacted COLE for assistance. In an email to COLE dated on or
about June 21, 2015, Poland Client described the concerns about raising both Child 1 and Child 2.
Poland Client expressed a strong desire to find another family to raise Child 2. Poland Client also
offered to travel to wherever in the United States that the other family resided to deliver Child 2
to that other family.

52. After receiving no response from COLE, Poland Client emailed COLE again three
days later and again expressed Poland Clientâs intention not to keep custody of Child 2. Poland
Client wrote to COLE, âI just want to follow up from my last email to see if there is anything [we]

need to be doing to make the process run more smoothly for the dissolution.â

53. COLE identified for Poland Client a few persons who would potentially adopt
Child 2, including Parris Relatives | and 2. COLE described Parris Relatives 1 and 2 as having a
biological child close in age to Child 2, which Poland Client believed made them a good fit. On
or about June 29, 2015, Poland Client emailed COLE, âWe are hopefully coming home sometime
this week and we need to make a plan... We both feel that we would prefer that [Child 2] is with
[Parris Relatives | and 2]... Have [Parris Relatives 1 and 2] been working on their home study?â
COLE never responded to that question.

54, Poland Client, while still in Poland, was told that Parris Relatives 1 and 2 were
relatives of PARRIS. Poland Client and PARRIS spoke multiple times by phone about Child 2.
Based on these conversations, Poland Client understood that PARRIS expected that Parris
Relatives | and 2.would permanently adopt Child 2. Poland Client and PARRIS agreed that Poland
Client would travel from Poland to Texas with Child 1 and Child 2, where Poland Client would
meet PARRIS at the airport and, through PARRIS, transfer Child 2 to Parris Relatives | and 2.

55. On or about June 27, 2015, Poland Clientâs adoptions of Child 1 and Child 2
became final under Polish law. .

56. On or about July 1, 2015, Poland Client applied for United States visas for Child 1
and Child 2 and was interviewed at the United States Embassy in Warsaw, Poland. Poland Client,
based on instructions from Co-Conspirator 1, did not mention that Poland Client had taken steps
to transfer custody of Child 2 to another family upon arrival in the United States. Rather, the visa
applications indicated that both Child.1 and Child 2 would live at Poland Clientâs home address.
On or about July 2, 2015, Poland Client obtained visas for both siblings. ,

57. On or about July 4, 2015, Poland Client traveled from Poland to Dallas/Fort Worth

International Airport (DFW Airport) with Child 1 and Child 2. There, Poland Client met PARRIS,

17
ease: Liz0-cr-00424-S0 Doc#i 1 Filed: 08/13/20 18 of 44, P

   

who had arranged for an attorney in Texas to draft documentation related to the transfer of custody
of Child 2 from Poland Client to Parris Relatives | and 2. PARRIS also arranged for Longoria to
meet them at DFW Airport to notarize the signatures on the transfer of custody paperwork.

58. Poland Client signed the documents at DFW Airport. PARRIS took Child 2 from
Poland Client: Poland Client traveled to her home with Child 1. Parris Relative 2, who
accompanied PARRIS to DFW but did not meet Poland Client, took custody of Child 2, who then
lived with Parris Relatives 1 and 2.

59. Adoption Agency had not obtained a home study or a criminal background check
of Parris Relatives 1 and 2âalthough COLE, PARRIS, and Co-Conspirator | all knew that
families pursuing intercountry adoptions from Poland were required to complete home studies and
undergo background checks.

60. In the months following July 4, 2015, Adoption Agency failed to inform the
Council on Accreditation, the State Department, and the Polish Central Authority that it had
facilitated the transfer of Child 2 from Poland Client to Parris Relatives 1 and 2, notwithstanding
its obligation under federal regulations to do so. COLE and PARRIS knew, however, that Parris
Relatives 1 and 2 continued to have custody of Child 2 and that Parris Relatives | and 2 intended
for the arrangement to be permanent.

61, On or about August 27, 2015, PARRIS sent an email to COLE and another
Adoption Agency employee that contained a proposed entry by PARRIS for an Adoption Agency
blog, in which PARRIS wrote, â[Parris Relatives 1 and 2] just adopted a young [child] from Poland
... Thad guided them through the process of international adoption on everything they could

expect from this journey...â

62. Parris Relatives | and 2 attempted to finalize the adoption of Child 2 under Texas
law. In order to do so, Parris Relative 2 provided a licensed clinical social worker with information
about Parris Relative 2âs criminal history, which included an arrest for domestic violence.
PARRIS learned of Parris Relative 2âs criminal history no later than in or around December 2015.
Parris Relatives 1 and 2 completed the adoption of Child 2 under Texas law in or around February
2016.

63. On or about April 18, 2016, in order to conceal the conduct related to the adoption
of Child 2 by Parris Relative 1 and 2, COLE caused Adoption Agency to submit a false report to
the Council on Accreditation related to the âdisruption / dissolutionâ of the adoption of Child 2
(the âApril 2016 COA Reportâ). The April 2016 COA Report contained the following false
statements, among others: (1) that Poland Client initially transferred Child 2 to Parris Relatives 1
and 2 for respite (temporary) care; and (2) that the âdisruption / dissolutionâ of the adoption of
Child 2 occurred within 30 days of the report (on March 21, 2016), even though Parris Relatives
1 and 2 took custody of Child 2 in July 2015 and completed the adoption of Child 2 under Texas
law of in Februaryâ2016. The April 2016 COA Report also concealed that Parris Relatives 1 and
2 were relatives of an Adoption Agency employee. .

64, On or about August 10, 2016, PARRIS contacted a counselor for a social services
agency who resided in Texas and was experienced in intercountry adoption (âAdoption
Counselorâ) and told her that Child 2 required counseling. On or about August 12, 2016, Parris
Relative 1 informed Adoption Counselor that Child 2 had been injured. Adoption Counselor told
Parris Relative 1 that Child 2 must be taken for a medical exam before the counseling program

could begin.

19
ease: Liz0-cr-00424-S0 Doc #1 Flled: 08/15/20 20 of 44. PageiD #20

   

65. Adoption Counselor discovered that Child 2 had been placed into the home of Parris
Relatives 1 and 2 before they had completed a home study. Adoption Counselor was concerned
that PARRIS had not fully informed Adoption Counselor about the amount of time that Child 2
had been living in Parris Relative | and 2âs home.

66. On or about August 12, 2016, Adoption Counselor 1 reported Adoption Agencyâs
actions related to Child 2 to the Council on Accreditation.

67. Child 2 was taken to Cook Childrenâs Hospital in Ft. Worth, Texas. Medical staff
identified significant injuries in several areas of Child 2âs body. Child 2âs case was referred to the
Texas Department of Family and Protective Services, which removed Child 2 from Parris Relative
1 and 2âs home. Child 2âs case was also referred to the Denton Police Department.

68. In or around late August 2016, the Denton Police Department informed Poland
Client that Child 2 had been injured. At around that same time, COLE contacted Poland Client.
COLE expressed concern to Poland Client that Adoption Agency would no longer be able to
complete adoptions in Poland because of the events concerning Child 2.

69. On or about September 2, 2016, COLE submitted another report to the Council on
Accreditation regarding the injury to Child 2 (the âSeptember 2016 COA Reportâ). In the report,
COLE wrote of Parris Relatives | and 2, â[t]he family in question is not a[n] [Adoption Agency]
family.â COLE again concealed in the September 2016 COA Report that Parris Relatives 1 and 2
were related to PARRIS, and also concealed that Adoption Agency facilitated the transfer of Child
2 to them.

70, On or about December 9, 2016, COLE received an email from the Polish Central
Authority informing her that it had suspended Adoption Agencyâs accreditation in Poland. It had

done so because of what it had learned about the treatment of Child 2.

20
ease: Liz0-cr-00424-S0 Doc#i 1 Filed: 08/13/20 21 of 44, P

   

71. Also on or about December 9, 2016, Parris Relative 1 wrote an email to PARRIS
that falsely stated, â[We] were just temporary guardians of there [sic] four year old child from
Poland until they decided what they wanted to do with the child until February 2016â. PARRIS
ââ knowing that Parris Relatives | and 2 took custody of Child 2 in July 2015 with the intent to
permanently adopt the child â forwarded the false email to COLE.

72. On or about December 11, 2016, COLE emailed a letter to the Polish Central
Authority (the âDecember 2016 Letterâ), In the December 2016 Letter, COLE made false
representations and concealed material facts in an attempt to get Adoption Agency reinstated in
Poland. In the December 2016 Letter, COLE, among other things: (1) falsely stated that Poland
Client transferred Child 2 to Parris Relatives 1 and 2 in July 2015 for temporary care although
Poland Client had repeatedly told COLE that she intended to transfer Child 2 to Parris Relatives 1
and 2 permanently; (2) concealed from the Polish Central Authority that Parris Relatives 1 and 2 |
were, as COLE knew, relatives of an Adoption Agency employee; and (3) concealed the role of
herself, PARRIS, and Co-Conspirator 1 in arranging the transfer of Child 2 to Parris Relatives 1
and 2.
