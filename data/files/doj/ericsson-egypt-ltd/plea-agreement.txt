Re: = United States v. Ericsson Egypt Ltd.

 

Dear Counsel:

Pursuant to Rule 11(c)(1)(C) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the United States
of America, by and through the Department of Justice, Criminal Division, Fraud Section (the
âFraud Sectionâ) and the Office of the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New
York (the âOfficeâ) (collectively, the âUnited Statesâ), and the Defendant, Ericsson Egypt Ltd.
(âEricsson Egyptâ or the âDefendantâ), by and through its undersigned attorneys, and through its
authorized representative, pursuant to authority granted by the Defendantâs shareholders, hereby
submit and enter into this plea agreement (the âAgreementâ). The terms and conditions of this
Agreement are as follows:

The Defendantâs Agreement
1. Pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(c)(1)(C), the Defendant agrees to waive its right to

grand jury indictment and its right to challenge venue in the District Court for the Southern District

1
of New York, and to plead guilty to a one-count criminal Information charging the Defendant with
conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States, in violation of Title 18, United States
Code, Section 371, that is, to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act of 1977 (âFCPAâ), as amended, see Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-1. The
Defendant further agrees to persist in that plea through sentencing and, as set forth below, to
cooperate fully with the Fraud Section and the Office in their investigation into the conduct
described in this Agreement and other conduct related to the conduct described in this Agreement
and the Statement of Facts attached hereto as Exhibit 2 (the âStatement of Factsâ).

2. The Defendant understands that, to be guilty of this offense, the following
essential elements of the offense must be satisfied:

Count One

a. The agreement specified in the Information, and not some other agreement

or agreements, existed between at least two people to violate the anti-bribery provision of

the FCPA;
b. the Defendant willfully joined in that agreement; and
& one of the conspirators committed an overt act during the period of the

conspiracy to effect the object of the conspiracy.

3 The Defendant understands and agrees that this Agreement is between the Fraud
Section and the Office and the Defendant and does not bind any other division or section of the
Department of Justice or any other federal, state, or local prosecuting, administrative, or regulatory
authority. Nevertheless, the Fraud Section and the Office will bring this Agreement and the nature
and quality of the conduct, cooperation and remediation of the Defendant and its direct or indirect

affiliates, parent companies, subsidiaries, and joint ventures, to the attention of other prosecuting
Z
authorities or other agencies, as well as debarment authorities and Multilateral Development Banks
(âMDBsâ), if requested by the Defendant.

4, The Defendant agrees that this Agreement will be executed by an authorized
corporate representative. The Defendant further agrees that a resolution duly adopted by the
Defendantâs shareholders in the form attached to this Agreement as Exhibit 1 authorizes the
Defendant to enter into this Agreement and take all necessary steps to effectuate this Agreement,
and that the signatures on this Agreement by the Defendant and its counsel are authorized by the
Defendantâs shareholders, on behalf of the Defendant.

5, The Defendant agrees that it has the full legal right, power, and authority to enter
into and perform all of its obligations under this Agreement.

6. The Fraud Section and the Office enter into this Agreement based on the individual
facts and circumstances presented by this case and Ericsson Egyptâs parent company,
Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson (the âParent Companyâ), including:

a. The Parent Company entered into a deferred prosecution agreement (the
âDPAâ) simultaneously to the Defendant entering its guilty plea;

b, The Parent Company has agreed to pay a total criminal monetary penalty of
$520,650,432 to the United States Treasury relating to the same conduct;

C. The Parent Company and the Defendant did not receive voluntary
disclosure credit pursuant to the FCPA Corporate Enforcement Policy in the Department of Justice
Manual (âJMâ) 9-47.120, or pursuant to the United States Sentencing Guidelines (âU.S.S.G.â or
âSentencing Guidelinesâ), because they did not voluntarily self-disclose to the Fraud Section and

the Office the conduct described in the Statement of Facts;
d. The Parent Company and the Defendant received partial credit for their
cooperation with the Fraud Sectionâs and the Officeâs investigation pursuant to the FCPA
Corporate Enforcement Policy, JM 9-47.120, because they conducted a thorough internal
investigation; made regular factual presentations to the Fraud Section and the Office; provided
facts learned during witness interviews conducted by the Parent Company; voluntarily made
foreign-based employees available for interviews in the United States; produced extensive
documentation, including documents located outside of the United States as well as translations of
foreign language documents; and proactively disclosed some conduct of which the Fraud Section
and the Office were previously unaware;

a. The Parent Company and the Defendant did not receive full credit for
cooperation and remediation pursuant to the FCPA Corporate Enforcement Policy, JM 9-47.120,
because the Parent Company did not disclose allegations of corruption with respect to two relevant
matters, produced certain relevant materials in an untimely manner, and did not timely and fully
remediate, including by failing to take adequate disciplinary measures with respect to certain
executives and other employees involved in the conduct;

- Although the Parent Company and the Defendant had inadequate anti-
corruption controls and an inadequate anti-corruption compliance program during the period of
the conduct described in the Statement of Facts, the Parent Company has been enhancing and has
committed to continuing to enhance its compliance program and internal accounting controls,
including ensuring that its compliance program satisfies the minimum elements set forth in
Attachment C to the DPA;

g. Because the Parent Company has not yet fully implemented or tested its

compliance program, the Parent Company has agreed to the imposition of an independent
4
compliance monitor to reduce the risk of misconduct, including at its subsidiaries including the
Defendant, as set forth in Attachment D to the DPA;

h. The nature and seriousness of the offense conduct, including the payment
of bribes to high-level government officials in Djibouti, as well as significant books and records
and internal controls violations in Djibouti, China, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Kuwait, over a period
of years which included the involvement of high-level executives at the Parent Company;

1. The Parent Company and the Defendant have no prior criminal history; and

is The Parent Company and the Defendant have agreed to continue to
cooperate with the Fraud Section and the Office in any ongoing investigation as described in
Paragraph 9 below;

k. The Parent Company has agreed to resolve with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (âSECâ) through a civil complaint and injunction that will be filed on
December 6, 2019, relating to the conduct described in the Statement of Facts, as well as conduct
in Saudi Arabia, and has agreed to pay $458,380,000 in disgorgement and $81,540,000 in pre-
judgment interest. |

l. Accordingly, after considering (a) through (j) above, the Fraud Section and
the Office believe the appropriate resolution in this case is a deferred prosecution agreement with
the Parent Company; a criminal monetary penalty of $520,650,432, which reflects an aggregate
discount of fifteen percent off of the bottom of the otherwise-applicable U.S. Sentencing
Guidelines fine range and which includes a criminal fine against the Defendant of $9,520,000 to
be paid by the Parent Company on behalf of Ericsson Egypt; the imposition of an independent

compliance monitor; and this guilty plea by Ericsson Egypt.
ve The Defendant agrees to abide by all terms and obligations of this Agreement as

described herein, including, but not limited to, the following:

a. to plead guilty as set forth in this Agreement,
b. to abide by all sentencing stipulations contained in this Agreement;
e, to appear, through its duly appointed representatives, as ordered for all court

appearances, and obey any other ongoing court order in this matter, consistent with all applicable

U.S. and foreign laws, procedures, and regulations;

d. to commit no further crimes;
e. to be truthful at all times with the Court;
i@ to pay the applicable fine and special assessment; and

g. to work with the Parent Company in fulfilling the obligations of the DPA.

8. Except as may otherwise be agreed by the parties in connection with a particular
transaction, the Defendant agrees that in the event that, during the term of the Parent Company
DPA (the âTermâ), the Defendant undertakes any change in corporate form, including if it sells,
merges, or transfers business operations that are material to the Defendantâs consolidated
operations, or to the operations of any subsidiaries or affiliates involved in the conduct described
in the Statement of Facts, as they exist as of the date of this Agreement, whether such sale is
structured as a sale, asset sale, merger, transfer, or other change in corporate form, it shall include
in any contract for sale, merger, transfer, or other change in corporate form a provision binding
the purchaser, or any successor in interest thereto, to the obligations described in this
Agreement. The purchaser or successor in interest must also agree in writing that the Fraud
Section and the Officeâs ability to declare a breach under this Agreement is applicable in full force

to that entity. The Defendant agrees that the failure to include these provisions in the transaction
6
will make any such transaction null and void. The Defendant shall provide notice to the Fraud
Section and the Office at least thirty days prior to undertaking any such sale, merger, transfer, or
other change in corporate form. The Fraud Section and the Office shall notify the Defendant prior
to such transaction (or series of transactions) if it determines that the transaction(s) will have the
effect of circumventing or frustrating the enforcement purposes of this Agreement. If at any time
during the Term the Defendant engages in a transaction(s) that has the effect of circumventing or
frustrating the enforcement purposes of this Agreement, the Fraud Section and the Office may
deem it a breach of this Agreement pursuant to Paragraphs 22-25 of this Agreement. Nothing
herein shall restrict the Defendant from indemnifying (or otherwise holding harmless) the
purchaser or successor in interest for penalties or other costs arising from any conduct that may
have occurred prior to the date of the transaction, so long as such indemnification does not have
the effect of circumventing or frustrating the enforcement purposes of this Agreement, as
determined by the Fraud Section and the Office.

9. The Defendant shall cooperate fully with the Fraud Section and the Office in any
and all matters relating to the conducted described in this Agreement and the Statement of Facts,
and other conduct under investigation by the Fraud Section and the Office at any time during the
Term, subject to applicable laws and regulations, until the later of the date upon which all
investigations and prosecutions arising out of such conduct are concluded, or the end of the Term.
At the request of the Fraud Section or the Office, the Defendant shall also cooperate fully with
other domestic or foreign law enforcement and regulatory authorities and agencies, as well as the
Multilateral Development Banks (âMDBsâ), in any investigation of the Defendant, the Parent
Company or its affiliates, or any of its present or former officers, directors, employees, agents, and

consultants, or any other party, in any and all matters relating to the conduct described in this
7
Agreement and the Statement of Facts. The Defendantâs cooperation pursuant to this Paragraph
is subject to applicable laws and regulations, including data privacy and national security laws and
regulations, as well as valid claims of attorney-client privilege or attorney work product doctrine;
however, the Parent Company must provide to the Fraud Section and the Office a log of any
information or cooperation that is not provided based on an assertion of law, regulation, or
privilege, and the Parent Company bears the burden of establishing the validity of any such
assertion. The Defendant agrees that its cooperation pursuant to this paragraph shall include, but
not be limited to, the following:

a. The Defendant shall truthfully disclose all factual information with respect
to its activities, those of its parent company and affiliates, and those of its present and former
directors, officers, employees, agents, and consultants, including any evidence or allegations and
internal or external investigations, about which the Defendant has any knowledge or about which
the Fraud Section and the Office may inquire. This obligation of truthful disclosure includes, but
is not limited to, the obligation of the Defendant to provide to the Fraud Section and the Office,
upon request, any document, record, or other tangible evidence about which the Fraud Section and
the Office may inquire of the Defendant. |

b. Upon request of the Fraud Section and the Office, the Defendant shall
designate knowledgeable employees, agents, or stomeys to provide to the Fraud Section and the
Office the information and materials described in Paragraph 9(a) above on behalf of the Defendant.
It is further understood that the Defendant must at all times provide complete, truthful, and accurate
information.

e. The Defendant shall use its best efforts to make available for interviews or

testimony, as requested by the Fraud Section and the Office, present or former officers, directors,
8
employees, agents and consultants of the Defendant. This obligation includes, but is not limited
to, sworn testimony before a federal grand jury or in federal trials, all meetings requested by the
Fraud Section and the Office, and interviews with domestic or foreign law enforcement and
regulatory authorities. Cooperation under this Paragraph shall include identification of witnesses
who, to the knowledge of the Defendant, may have material information regarding the matters
being investigated or prosecuted.

d. With respect to any information, testimony, documents, records, or other
tangible evidence provided to the Fraud Section and the Office pursuant to this Agreement, the
Defendant consents to any and all disclosures, subject to applicable law and regulations, to other
governmental authorities, including United States authorities and those of a foreign government,
as well as the MDBs, of such materials as the Fraud Section and the Office, in their sole discretion,
shall deem appropriate.

10. During the term of the cooperation obligations provided for in the Paragraph 9 of
the Agreement, should the Defendant learn of any evidence or allegation of conduct that may
constitute a violation of the FCPA anti-bribery or accounting provisions had the conduct occurred
within the jurisdiction of the United States, the Defendant shall promptly report such evidence or
allegation to the Fraud Section and the Office. Thirty days prior to the end of the term of the
cooperation obligations provided for in Paragraph 9 of the Agreement, the Defendant, through an
appropriate senior executive, will certify to the Fraud Section and the Office that the Defendant
has met its disclosure obligations pursuant to Paragraph 9 and this Paragraph. Each certification
will be deemed a material statement and representation by the Defendant to the executive branch
of the United States for purposes of 18 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1001 and 1519, and it will be deemed to have

been made in the judicial district in which this Agreement is filed.
9
11. The Defendant agrees that any fine or restitution imposed by the Court will be due
and payable in full within ten days of the entry of judgment following such sentencing hearing,
and the Defendant will not attempt to avoid or delay payment. The Defendant further agrees to
pay the Clerk of the Court for the United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York the mandatory special assessment of $400 per count within ten business days from the date
of sentencing.

The United Statesâ Agreement

12. In exchange for the guilty plea of the Defendant and the complete fulfillment of all
of its obligations under this Agreement, the Fraud Section and the Office agree they will not file
additional criminal charges against the Defendant, the Parent Company, or any of its direct or
indirect affiliates, subsidiaries, or joint ventures relating to any of the conduct described in the
Statement of Facts, except as set forth in the DPA. This Paragraph does not provide any protection
against prosecution for any crimes, including corrupt payments or related false books and records
and failure to implement adequate internal controls, made in the future by the Defendant, by the
Parent Company, or by any of their officers, directors, employees, agents, or consultants, whether
or not disclosed by the Defendant pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. This Agreement does
not close or preclude the investigation or prosecution of any natural persons, including any
officers, directors, employees, agents, or consultants of the Defendant, the Parent Company or
their direct or indirect affiliates, subsidiaries, or joint ventures, who may have been involved in
any of the matters set forth in the Information, the Statement of Facts, or in any other matters. The
Defendant agrees that nothing in this Agreement is intended to release the Defendant from any of
the Defendantâs excise and income tax liabilities and reporting obligations for any and all income

not properly reported and/or legally or illegally obtained or derived.
10
Factual Basis

13. The Defendant is pleading guilty because it is guilty of the charge contained in the
Information. The Defendant admits, agrees, and stipulates that the factual allegations set forth in
the Information and the Statement of Facts are true and correct, that it is responsible for the acts
of its officers, directors, employees, and agents described in the Information and the Statement of
Facts, and that the Information and the Statement of Facts accurately reflect the Defendantâs
criminal conduct.

The Defendantâs Waiver of Rights, Including the Right to Appeal

14. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(f) and Federal Rule of Evidence 410 limit
the admissibility of statements made in the course of plea proceedings or plea discussions in both
civil and criminal proceedings, if the guilty plea is later withdrawn. The Defendant expressly
warrants that it has discussed these rules with its counsel and understands them. Solely to the
extent set forth below, the Defendant voluntarily waives and gives up the rights enumerated in
Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(f) and Federal Rule of Evidence 410. Specifically, the
Defendant understands and agrees that any statements that it makes in the course of its guilty plea
or in connection with the Agreement are admissible against it for any purpose in any U.S. federal
criminal proceeding if, even though the Fraud Section and the Office have fulfilled all of their
obligations under this Agreement and the Court has imposed the agreed-upon sentence, the
Defendant nevertheless withdraws its guilty plea.

15. | The Defendant is satisfied that the Defendantâs attorneys have rendered effective
assistance. The Defendant understands that by entering into this agreement, the Defendant
surrenders certain rights as provided in this agreement. The Defendant understands that the rights

of criminal defendants include the following:
11
(a) the right to plead not guilty and to persist in that plea;

(b) the right to a jury trial;

(c) the right to be represented by counsel â and if necessary have the court appoint
counsel â at trial and at every other stage of the proceedings;

(d) the right at trial to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses, to be protected
from compelled self-incrimination, to testify and present evidence, and to compel the attendance
of witnesses; and

(e) pursuant to Title 18, United States Code, Section 3742, the right to appeal the
sentence imposed.

Nonetheless, the Defendant knowingly waives the right to appeal or collaterally attack the
conviction and any sentence within the statutory maximum described below (or the manner in
which that sentence was determined) on the grounds set forth in Title 18, United States Code,
Section 3742, or on any ground whatsoever except those specifically excluded in this Paragraph,
in exchange for the concessions made by the United States in this plea agreement. This agreement
does not affect the rights or obligations of the United States as set forth in Title 18, United States
Code, Section 3742(b). The Defendant also knowingly waives the right to bring any collateral
challenge challenging either the conviction or the sentence imposed in this case. The Defendant
hereby waives all rights, whether asserted directly or by a representative, to request or receive from
any department or agency of the United States any records pertaining to the investigation or
prosecution of this case, including without limitation any records that may be sought under the
Freedom of Information Act, Title 5, United States Code, Section 552, or the Privacy Act, Title 5,
United States Code, Section 552a. The Defendant waives all defenses based on the statute of

limitations and venue with respect to any prosecution related to the conduct described in the
12
Statement of Facts or the Information, including any prosecution that is not time-barred on the date
that this Agreement is signed in the event that: (a) the conviction is later vacated for any reason;
(b) the Defendant violates this Agreement; or (c) the plea is later withdrawn, provided such
prosecution is brought within one year of any such vacation of conviction, violation of agreement,
or withdrawal of plea plus the remaining time period of the statute of limitations as of the date that
this Agreement is signed. The Fraud Section and the Office are free to take any position on appeal
or any other post-judgment matter. The parties agree that any challenge to the Defendantâs
sentence that is not foreclosed by this Paragraph will be limited to that portion of the sentencing
calculation that is inconsistent with (or not addressed by) this waiver. Nothing in the foregoing
waiver of appellate and collateral review rights shall preclude the Defendant from raising a claim
of ineffective assistance of counsel in an appropriate forum.
Penalty

16. The statutory maximum sentence that the Court can impose for the offense charged
in the Information is a fine of $500,000, or twice the gross gain or gross loss resulting from the
offense, whichever is the greatest, see 18 U.S.C. 3571(c)(3) & (d); five yearsâ probation, see Title
18, United States Code, Section 3561(c)(1); restitution in the amount of any victimsâ losses as
ordered by the Court. and a mandatory special assessment of $400 per count, see Title 18, United
States Code, Section 3013(a)(2)(B). In this case, the parties agree that the gross pecuniary gain
resulting from the offense is $7,000,000. Therefore, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Â§ 3571(d), the
maximum fine that may be imposed is $14,000,000 per offense, or in this case a total of

$14,000,000.

13
Sentencing Recommendation

17. The parties agree that pursuant to United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005), the
Court must determine an advisory sentencing guideline range pursuant to the United States
Sentencing Guidelines. The Court will then determine a reasonable sentence within the statutory
range after considering the advisory sentencing guideline range and the factors listed in Title 18,
United States Code, Section 3553(a). The partiesâ agreement herein to any guideline sentencing
factors constitutes proof of those factors sufficient to satisfy fhe apelinabite burden of proof. The
Defendant also understands that if the Court accepts this Agreement, the Court is bound by the
sentencing provisions in Paragraph 16.

18. The Fraud Section and the Office and the Defendant agree that a faithful application
of the Sentencing Guidelines to determine the applicable fine range yields the following analysis:

a. The 2018 version of the U.S.S.G. is applicable to this matter.

b. Offense Level. Based upon U.S.S.G. Â§ 2C1.1, the total offense level is 36,
calculated as follows:

(a)(2) Base Offense Level . 12
(b)(1) More than one bribe 4D

(b)(2) Value of benefit received ($7,000,000) is greater
than $3,500,000 but not more than $9,500,000 +18

(b)(3) Public official in a high-level decision-making
position +4

TOTAL 36

C. Base Fine. Based upon U.S.S.G. Â§ 8C2.4(a)(1), the base fine is
$80,000,000

d. Culpability Score. Based upon U.S.S.G. Â§ 8C2.5, the culpability score is
6, calculated as follows:
14
(a) Base Culpability Score 2

(b)(3) the unit of the organization within which the offense
was committed had 200 or more employees and an
individual within high-level personnel of the unit
participated in, condoned, or was willfully ignorant
of the offense +3

(g)(2) The organization fully cooperated in the
investigation and clearly demonstrated recognition
and affirmative acceptance of responsibility for the
criminal conduct -2

TOTAL 6

Calculation of Fine Range:

Base Fine $80,000,000

Multipliers 1.20 (min)/2.40 (max)

Fine Range $96,000,000 (min)/
$192,000,000 (max)

19. Pursuant to Rule 11(c)(1)(C) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Fraud
Section and the Office and the Defendant agree that the following represents the appropriate
disposition of the case:

a. Disposition. Pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(c)(1)(C), the Fraud Section,
the Office, and the Defendant agree that the appropriate disposition of this case is as set forth
above, and agree to recommend jointly that the Court at a hearing to be scheduled at an agreed
upon time impose a sentence requiring the Defendant to pay a criminal fine of $9,520,000, payable,
in full within ten business days of such sentencing hearing (âthe Recommended Sentenceâ). The
parties agree that the Recommended Sentence is appropriate in light of the Parent Company DPA,

which relates to, among other conduct, the same conduct to which the Defendant is pleading guilty,
15
and which requires the Parent Company to pay a total criminal fine of $520,650,432 as a result of
the misconduct committed by both the Parent Company and the Defendant, as well as the factors
cited in the DPA. As described in the DPA, the Recommended Sentence shall be deducted from
the $520,650,432 total criminal monetary penalty and shall be paid by the Parent Company.

b. The Defendant shall not seek or accept, directly or indirectly,
reimbursement or indemnification from any source, other than the Parent Company, with regard
to the fine, forfeiture, or disgorgement amounts that the Defendant pays pursuant to the Agreement
or any other agreement entered into with an enforcement authority or regulator concerning the
facts set forth in the Statement of Facts. The Defendant further acknowledges that no tax deduction
may be sought in connection with the payment of any part of this $9,520,000 criminal fine. The
Fraud Section and the Office believe that a disposition that includes $9,520,000 criminal fine is
appropriate based on the factors outlined in Paragraph 6 of this Agreement and those set forth in
18 U.S.C. Â§ 3553(a).

oe Mandatory Special Assessment. The Defendant shall pay to the Clerk of

 

the Court for the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York within ten
days of the time of sentencing the mandatory special assessment of $400 per count.

d. Restitution. As of the date of the Agreement, the Fraud Section, the Office
and the Defendant have not identified any victim qualifying for restitution and thus are not
requesting an order of restitution. The Defendant recognizes and agrees, however, that restitution
is imposed at the sole discretion of the Court. The Defendant agrees to pay restitution as part of
the Agreement in the event restitution is ordered by the Court.

20. This Agreement is presented to the Court pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(Â¢)(1)(C).

The Defendant understands that, if the Court rejects this Agreement, the Court must: (a) inform
16
the parties that the Court rejects the Agreement; (b) advise the Defendantâs counsel that the Court
is not required to follow the Agreement and afford the Defendant the opportunity to withdraw its
plea; and (c) advise the Defendant that if the plea is not withdrawn, the Court may dispose of the
case less favorably toward the Defendant than the Agreement contemplated. The Defendant
further understands that if the Court refuses to accept any provision of this Agreement, neither
party shall be bound by the provisions of the Agreement.

21. The Fraud Section, the Office, and the Defendant waive the preparation of a Pre-
Sentence Investigation Report (âPSRâ) and intend to seek a sentencing by the Court immediately
following the Rule 11 hearing in the absence of a PSR. The Defendant understands that the
decision whether to proceed with the sentencing proceeding without a PSR is exclusively that of
the Court. In the event the Court directs the preparation of a Presentence Investigation Report, the
Fraud Section and the Office will fully inform the preparer of the Presentence Investigation Report
and the Court of the facts and law related to the Defendantâs case. At the time of the plea hearing,
the parties will suggest mutually agreeable and convenient dates for the sentencing hearing with
adequate time for (a) any objections to the Presentence Report, and (b) consideration by the Court
of the Presentence Report and the partiesâ sentencing submissions.

Breach of Agreement

22. If, during the Term, the Defendant (a) commits any felony under U.S. federal law;
(b) provides in connection with this Agreement deliberately false, incomplete, or misleading
information; (c) fails to cooperate as set forth in Paragraphs 9 and 10 of this Agreement; (d)
commits any acts that, had they occurred within the jurisdictional reach of FCPA, would be a
violation of the FCPA; or (e) otherwise fails specifically to perform or to fulfill completely each

of the Defendantâs obligations under the Agreement, regardless of whether the Fraud Section and
17
the Office become aware of such a breach after the term specified in the Parent Company DPA,
the Defendant shall thereafter be subject to prosecution for any federal criminal violation of which
the Fraud Section and the Office have knowledge, including, but not limited to, the charge in the
Information described in Paragraph 1, which may be pursued by the Office in the U.S. District
Court for the Southern District of New York or any other appropriate venue. Determination of
whether the Defendant has breached the Agreement and whether to pursue prosecution of the
Defendant shall be in the Fraud Section and the Officeâs sole discretion. Any such prosecution
may be premised on information provided by the Defendant. Any such prosecution relating to the
conduct described in the attached Statement of Facts or relating to conduct known to the Fraud
Section and the Office prior to the date on which this Agreement was signed that is not time-barred
by the applicable statute of limitations on the date of the signing of this Agreement may be
commenced against the Defendant, notwithstanding the expiration of the statute of limitations,
between the signing of this Agreement and the expiration of the Term plus one year. Thus, by
signing this Agreement, the Defendant agrees that the statute of limitations with respect to any
such prosecution that is not time-barred on the date of the signing of this Agreement shall be tolled
for the term described the DPA plus one year. The Defendant gives up all defenses based on the
statute of limitations, any claim of pre-indictment delay, or any speedy trial claim with respect to
any such prosecution or action, except to the extent that such defenses existed as of the date of the
signing of this Agreement. In addition, the Defendant agrees that the statute of limitations as to
any violation of federal law that occurs during the term of the cooperation obligations provided
for in Paragraph 9 of the Agreement will be tolled from the date upon which the violation occurs

until the earlier of the date upon which the Fraud Section and the Office are made aware of the

18
violation or the duration of the term plus five years, and that this period shall be excluded from
any calculation of time for purposes of the application of the statute of limitations.

23. In the event the Fraud Section and the Office determine that the Defendant has
breached this Agreement, the Fraud Section and the Office agree to provide the Defendant with
written notice of such breach prior to instituting any prosecution resulting from such breach.
Within thirty days of receipt of such notice, the Defendant shall have the opportunity to respond
to the Fraud Section and the Office in writing to explain the nature and circumstances of such
breach, as well as the actions the Defendant has taken to address and remediate the situation, which
explanation the Fraud Section and the Office shall consider in determining whether to pursue
prosecution of the Defendant.

24. Inthe event that the Fraud Section and the Office determine that the Defendant has
breached this Agreement: (a) all statements made by or on behalf of the Defendant to the Fraud
Section and the Office or to the Court, including the attached Statement of Facts, and any testimony
given by the Defendant before a grand jury, a court, or any tribunal, or at any legislative hearings,
whether prior or subsequent to this Agreement, and any leads derived from such statements or
testimony, shall be admissible in evidence in any and all criminal proceedings brought by the Fraud
Section and the Office against the Defendant; and (b) the Defendant shall not assert any claim
under the United States Constitution, Rule 11(f) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rule
410 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, or any other federal rule that any such statements or
testimony made by or on behalf of the Defendant prior or subsequent to this Agreement, or any
leads derived therefrom, should be suppressed or are otherwise inadmissible. The decision
whether conduct or statements of any current director, officer, or employee, or any person acting

on behalf of, or at the direction of, the Defendant, will be imputed to the Defendant for the purpose
19
of determining whether the Defendant has violated any provision of this Agreement shall be in the
sole discretion of the Fraud Section and the Office.

25. The Defendant acknowledges that the Fraud Section and the Office have made no
representations, assurances, or promises concerning what sentence may be imposed by the Court
if the Defendant breaches this Agreement and this matter proceeds to judgment. The Defendant
further acknowledges that any such sentence is solely within the discretion of the Court and that
nothing in this Agreement binds or restricts the Court in the exercise of such discretion.

Public Statements by the Defendant

26. The Defendant expressly agrees that it shall not, through present or future
attorneys, officers, directors, employees, agents, or any other person authorized to speak for the
Defendant make any public statement, in litigation or otherwise, contradicting the acceptance of
responsibility by the Defendant set forth above or the facts described in the Information and the
Statement of Facts. Any such contradictory statement shall, subject to cure rights of the Defendant
described below, constitute a breach of this Agreement, and the Defendant thereafter shall be
subject to prosecution as set forth in Paragraphs 22-25 of this Agreement. The decision whether
any public statement by any such person contradicting a fact contained in the Information or the
Statement of Facts will be imputed to the Defendant for the purpose of determining whether it has
breached this Agreement shall be at the sole discretion of the Fraud Section and the Office. If the
Fraud Section and the Office determine that a public statement by any such person contradicts in
whole or in part a statement contained in the Information or the Statement of Facts, the Fraud
Section and the Office shall so notify the Defendant, and the Defendant may avoid a breach of this
Agreement by publicly repudiating such statement(s) within five business days after notification.

The Defendant shall be permitted to raise defenses and to assert affirmative claims in other
20
proceedings relating to the matters set forth in the Information and the Statement of Facts provided
that such defenses and claims do not contradict, in whole or in part, a statement contained in the
Information or the Statement of Facts. This Paragraph does not apply to any statement made by
any present or former officer, director, employee, or agent of the Defendant in the course of any
criminal, regulatory, or civil case initiated against such individual, unless such individual is
speaking on behalf of the Defendant.

Zi. The Defendant agrees that if it or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries or
affiliates issues a press release or holds any press conference in connection with this Agreement,
the Defendant shall first consult the Fraud Section and the Office to determine (a) whether the text
of the release or proposed statements at the press conference are true and accurate with respect to
matters between the Fraud Section and the Office and the Defendant; and (b) whether the Fraud

Section and the Office have any objection to the release or statement.

21
Complete Agreement

28. This document states the full extent of the Agreement between the parties. There
are no other promises or agreements, express or implied. Any modification of this Agreement
shall be valid only if set forth in writing in a supplemental or revised plea agreement signed by all

parties.
