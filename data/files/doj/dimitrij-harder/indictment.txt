At all times relevant to this indictment, unless otherwise specified:

Introduction

1. Defendant DMITRIJ HARDER was a Russian national, naturalized German

citizen and permanent resident alien of the United States. Defendant HARDER was the
Case 2:15-cr-00001-PD Document1 Filed 01/06/15 Page 2 of 23

president and owner of both the Chestnut Consulting Group, Inc. (âChestnut Inc.â), which was
incorporated in the State of Pennsylvania, and the Chestnut Consulting Group, Co., which was
incorporated in the State of Delaware. Defendant HARDER operated through one or both of
these entities (generally referred to herein as the âChestnut Groupâ) purportedly to provide,
among other things, consulting services to companies seeking financing from multilateral
development banks. The Chestnut Group was located in Southampton, in the Eastern District of
Pennsylvania. Because both Chestnut Inc. and Chestnut Consulting Group, Co. had their
principal place of business in the United States and were organized under the laws of
Pennsylvania and Delaware, each was a âdomestic concern,â as that term is used in the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act (ââFCPAâ), Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2(h)(1)(A). Because
defendant HARDER was a resident of the United States, defendant HARDER was a âdomestic
concern,â and an officer, director, employee and agent of a âdomestic concern,â as that term is
used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2(h)()(A).

2. Between in or around 2007 through in or around 2009, defendant HARDER
engaged in a scheme to pay approximately $3.5 million in bribe payments for the benefit of a
foreign official to corruptly influence the foreign officialâs actions on applications for financing
submitted to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (âEBRDââ) by the clients
of defendant HARDER and the Chestnut Group, and to corruptly influence the foreign official to
direct business to defendant HARDER and the Chestnut Group, and others.

Additional Relevant Entities and Individuals

3. The EBRD was a multilateral development bank headquartered in London,

England, and was owned by over 60 sovereign nations. Among other things, the EBRD provided

debt and equity financing for development projects in emerging economies, primarily in Eastern
Europe. On or about June 18, 1991, the President of the United States signed Executive Order
12766 designating the EBRD as a âpublic international organization.ââ The EBRD was thus a
âpublic international organization,â as that term is defined in the FCPA, Title 15, United States
Code, Section 78dd-2(h)(2).

4. âEBRD Officialâ was a Russian and United Kingdom national residing in or
around London, England, and was a senior banker working in the Natural Resources Group at
the EBRD. As a senior banker, EBRD Official served as an Operations Leader in the Natural
Resources Group and was responsible for leading the review of applications submitted to the
EBRD for project financing, including loans and equity investments. EBRD Official thus had
the authority to influence the process for approving project financing, and setting the terms and
conditions for that financing. EBRD Official was a âforeign official,â as that term is used in the
FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2(h)(2). Defendant DMITRIJ HARDER
knew EBRD Official from business associations dating back to at least 1999.

5. âEBRD Officialâs Sisterâ was a Russian and United Kingdom national residing in
or around London, England, and was the sister of EBRD Official. EBRD Officialâs Sister
purportedly provided consulting and other business services for the Chestnut Group. In reality,
however, EBRD Officialâs Sister provided no such services to the Chestnut Group or defendant
HARDER.

6. âCompany Aâ was a Russian independent oil and gas company established in
2000. Company A had oil and gas operations in the Russian Federation. Company A retained

Chestnut Inc. purportedly to provide consulting and other services.
Case 2:15-cr-00001-PD Document1 Filed 01/06/15 Page 4 of 23

7. âCompany Bâ was an oil and gas company established in 2006 and incorporated
in the United Kingdom. Company B had oil and gas operations in the Russian Federation.
Company B retained Chestnut Inc. purportedly to provide consulting and other services.

The Bribery Scheme

8. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, Title 15, United States
Code, Sections 78dd-1, et seq. (âFCPAââ), prohibited certain classes of persons and entities from
corruptly making payments to foreign officials to assist in obtaining or retaining business.
Specifically, the FCPA prohibited certain corporations and individuals from willfully making use
of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce corruptly in furtherance of an offer,
payment, promise to pay, or authorization of the payment of money or anything of value to any
person, while knowing that all or a portion of such money or thing of value would be offered,
given, or promised, directly or indirectly, to a foreign official to influence the foreign official in
his or her official capacity, induce the foreign official to do or omit to do an act in violation of
his or her lawful duty, or to secure any improper advantage in order to assist in obtaining or
retaining business for or with, or directing business to, any person.

9. The Travel Act, Title 18, United States Code, Section 1952, was enacted by
Congress for the purpose of, among other things, making it unlawful for persons and businesses
to travel in interstate or foreign commerce or use the mail or any facility in interstate commerce
to promote, manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate the promotion, management, establishment
or carrying on of certain unlawful activity, including violations of state anti-bribery laws.

10. Between in or about 2007 and in or about 2009, defendant DMITRIJ HARDER,
through the Chestnut Group, worked as a financial consultant to companies seeking project

financing from the EBRD. For at least four of these applications, including those of Company A
Case 2:15-cr-00001-PD Document1 Filed 01/06/15 Page 5 of 23

and Company B, EBRD Official was the Operations Leader responsible for leading the
management of the application process and negotiating the terms and conditions of any financing
provided by the EBRD. Chestnut Inc. was retained by Company A and Company B despite its
relatively small size, distant location from the EBRD, and unproven track record as a financial
advisor. As set forth below, the EBRD ultimately approved the applications for project financing
for Company A and Company B.

Company Aâs Application for Financing to the EBRD

 

11. In or about August 2007, Company A approached defendant DMITRIJ HARDER
and the Chestnut Group to assist it in raising financing for a natural gas development project in
Russia.

12. In or about September 2007, defendant DMITRIJ HARDER sent EBRD Official
an email about obtaining project financing from the EBRD for Company A in connection with
the project in Russia referenced in paragraph 11 above.

13. In or about October 2007, Chestnut Inc. entered into a financial services
agreement with Company A, which was signed by defendant DMITRIJ HARDER, whereby
Company A agreed to pay Chestnut Inc. a âsuccess feeâ of a certain percentage of the funds
obtained by Company A from the EBRD. On or about December 24, 2007, the financial
services agreement was amended by a supplemental financial services agreement, which
defendant HARDER also signed on behalf of Chestnut Inc.

14. On or about April 29, 2008, based upon the recommendation of EBRD Official as
the Operations Leader for Company Aâs application, the EBRD approved an $85 million equity

investment in Company A.
Case 2:15-cr-00001-PD Document1 Filed 01/06/15 Page 6 of 23

15. On or about May 13, 2008, Chestnut Inc. entered into a new financial services
agreement with a holding company for Company A (the âHolding Companyââ) created for the
specific purpose of receiving the EBRD funding. This agreement was almost identical to the
supplemental agreement between Chestnut Inc. and Company A, except that the agreement
provided that Chestnut Inc. would assist the Holding Company, rather than Company A, to raise
financing. This agreement was also signed on behalf of Chestnut Inc. by defendant DMITRIJ
HARDER.

16. On or about June 4, 2008, the $85 million equity investment was disbursed by
EBRD to the Holding Company, on behalf of Company A.

17. On or about June 25, 2008, as a result of the approval of Company Aâs
application to the EBRD for financing, the Holding Company paid Chestnut Inc. a âsuccess feeâ
amounting to approximately $1.7 million.

18. On or about the following dates, after receiving the success fees from Company A
and the Holding Company, defendant DMITRIJ HARDER caused wire transfer payments to be
made in approximately the following amounts from Chestnut Inc.âs bank account at
Commerzbank in Frankfurt, Germany, to the Citibank bank account in Jersey, Channel Islands,

belonging to EBRD Officialâs Sister:

 

Approximate Date Approximate Amount
July 11, 2008 $300,000
September 16, 2008 $199,637
October 13, 2008 $253,665

19. On or about March 10, 2009, the EBRD approved additional project financing for

Company A, in the form of a senior loan totaling 90 million Euros.
20. On or about April 10, 2009, Chestnut Inc. and Company A entered into a further
supplemental financial services agreement, which rescinded the earlier success fee, and made the
new success fee payable on the original equity investment of $85 million and new senior loan of
90 million Euros. This supplemental financial services agreement was signed on behalf of
Chestnut Inc. by defendant DMITRIJ HARDER.

21. On or about June 18, 2009, Company A paid Chestnut Inc. a new success fee of
approximately $2.9 million, based upon both the equity investment and senior loan from the
EBRD to Company A.

22. On or about July 16, 2009, defendant DMITRIJ HARDER caused the wire
transfer of approximately $310,121 from Chestnut Inc.âs bank account at 3rd Federal Bank in
Feasterville, Pennsylvania to the Citibank bank account in Jersey, Channel Islands, belonging to
EBRD Officialâs Sister.

23. In all, Chestnut Inc. received payments from Company A totaling approximately
$2.9 million, and defendant DMITRIJ HARDER caused payments to be made to EBRD
Officialâs Sister totaling approximately $1.06 million. While EBRD Officialâs Sister purportedly
received these payments as a result of providing consulting and other business services to the
Chestnut Group, in reality, EBRD Officialâs Sister provided no such services. Instead, EBRD
Officialâs Sister received these payments for the benefit of EBRD Official, to corruptly influence
the foreign officialâs actions on applications for financing by the clients of defendant HARDER
and the Chestnut Group, and to corruptly influence the foreign official to direct business to

defendant HARDER and the Chestnut Group.
Case 2:15-cr-00001-PD Document1 Filed 01/06/15 Page 8 of 23

Company Bâs Application for Financing to the EBRD

 

24. In or about 2007, Company B initially approached the EBRD about obtaining
financing for a gas development project. Although it appeared that the EBRD would approve
Company Bâs application for financing, Company B ultimately declined to obtain financing from
the EBRD and instead obtained its financing from another international bank. Company B did
not use the services of a financial consultant in connection with its initial application to the
EBRD.

25. On or about May 7, 2009, Company B approached the EBRD again about
obtaining additional financing. EBRD Official and others from the EBRD met with
representatives from Company B to discuss Company Bâs interest in obtaining such financing.
EBRD Official was thereafter assigned as Operations Leader for Company Bâs application for
financing with the EBRD.

26. On or about May 19, 2009, Chestnut Inc. and Company B entered into a financial
services agreement, whereby Company B agreed to pay Chestnut Inc. a âsuccess feeâ of a certain
percentage of the funds obtained by Company B. The financial services agreement was signed
on behalf of Chestnut Inc. by defendant DMITRIJ HARDER.

27. On or about July 29, 2009, based upon the recommendation of EBRD Official as
the Operations Leader for Company Bâs application, the EBRD approved Company Bâs
application for financing consisting of a $40 million equity investment and a $60 million
convertible loan.

28. On or about October 1, 2009, Company B paid Chestnut Inc. a success fee of

approximately $4.9 million. Because on or about July 27, 2009, Company B had previously paid
Case 2:15-cr-00001-PD Document1 Filed 01/06/15 Page 9 of 23

Chestnut Inc. an initial payment of approximately $100,000 to be credited to any success fees,
the total success fee paid by Company B to Chestnut Inc. was approximately $5 million.

29. On or about November 20, 2009, after Chestnut Inc. received the success fees
from Company B, defendant DMITRIJ HARDER caused a payment of approximately
$2,478,580.89 to be made to EBRD Offficialâs Sister. Although EBRD Officialâs Sister
purportedly received these payments as a result of providing consulting and other business
services to the Chestnut Group, in reality, EBRD Officialâs Sister provided no such services.
Instead, EBRD Officialâs Sister received these payments for the benefit of EBRD Official, to
corruptly influence the foreign officialâs actions on applications for financing by the clients of
defendant HARDER and the Chestnut Group, and to corruptly influence the foreign official to
direct business to defendant HARDER and the Chestnut Group.

The Concealment of the Bribe Payments

 

30. Through the Chestnut Group, defendant DMITRIJ HARDER paid EBRD
Officialâs Sister approximately $3.5 million in bribe payments for the benefit of EBRD Official.

31. To conceal and cover up these bribe payments, defendant DMITRIJ HARDER
and EBRD Officialâs Sister created false paperwork to make it appear that EBRD Officialâs
Sister had provided services to the Chestnut Group for these payments, when in fact no such
services were provided. The false documents included the following:

a. an invoice dated May 20, 2009 from EBRD Officialâs Sister to the
Chestnut Group requesting payment of $310,141.04 for being a

â[p|roducing agent - various projects;â
Case 2:15-cr-00001-PD Document1 Filed 01/06/15 Page 10 of 23

b. a âConfirmation of Servicesâ letter, dated October 9, 2009, from
Chestnut Inc. to EBRD Officialâs Sister setting forth a âpre-agreed co-
brokerage feeâ in the amount of âup to $2.6 million;â and
c. an invoice dated November 18, 2009 from EBRD Officialâs Sister to
the Chestnut Group requesting payment of approximately
$2,478,580.89 for being a â[p]roducing agent - various projects.â
The Conspiracy Charge
32. From in or around 2007 through in or around November 2009, in the Eastern
District of Pennsylvania and elsewhere, defendant
DMITRIJ HARDER
did knowingly and willfully combine, conspire, confederate and agree with EBRD Offficialâs
Sister, and others known and unknown to the grand jury, to commit offenses against the United
States, namely, violations of the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2; and
violations of the Travel Act, Title 18, United States Code, Section 1952(a)(3)(A), through
commercial bribery contrary to Title 18, Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann., Section 4108.
Object of the Conspiracy
33. The object of the conspiracy was for defendant DMITRIJ HARDER, EBRD

Officialâs Sister, and others, to enrich themselves by making payments to EBRD Officialâs Sister
to corruptly influence EBRD Officialâs actions on applications for financing submitted to the
EBRD by the clients of defendant HARDER and the Chestnut Group, and to corruptly influence

EBRD Official to direct business to defendant HARDER and the Chestnut Group.

Case 2:15-cr-00001-PD Document1 Filed 01/06/15 Page 11 of 23

Manner and Means of the Conspiracy

Officialâs Sister, and others, discussed the payment of bribes from HARDER to and for the
benefit of EBRD Official.

35. It was further part of the conspiracy that defendant DMITRIJ HARDER, EBRD
Officialâs Sister, and others, offered to pay, promised to pay, and authorized and caused the
payment of bribes, directly and indirectly, to and for the benefit of EBRD Official.

36. It was further part of the conspiracy that defendant DMITRIJ HARDER, EBRD
Officialâs Sister, and others, discussed the bank accounts belonging to EBRD Officialâs Sister
into which defendant HARDER would cause the bribe payments to be paid.

37. It was further part of the conspiracy that defendant DMITRIJ HARDER, EBRD
Officialâs Sister, and others, attempted to conceal the bribe payments to EBRD Official by
making payments to EBRD Officialâs Sister.

38. It was further part of the conspiracy that defendant DMITRIJ HARDER and
others caused the transfer of approximately $3.5 million in bribe payments to bank accounts
designated by EBRD Offficialâs Sister, to corruptly influence EBRD Officialâs actions on
applications for financing submitted to the EBRD by the clients of defendant HARDER and the
Chestnut Group, and to corruptly influence EBRD Official to direct business to the Chestnut
Group.

39. It was further part of the conspiracy that defendant DMITRIJ HARDER, EBRD
Officialâs Sister, and others, attempted to conceal the payments to EBRD Official by creating
false paperwork and justifications for the payments to EBRD Officialâs Sister, including by

creating invoices that falsely claimed she performed services for the Chestnut Group.
