Former Owner and President of Pennsylvania Consulting Companies Pleads Guilty to Bribing
Official at European Bank for Reconstruction and Development

The former owner and president of Chestnut Consulting Group Inc. and Chestnut Consulting Group Co. (the Chestnut Group) pleaded guilty
today to bribing an official at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
(FCPA).

Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Zane David Memeger of the Eastern
District of Pennsylvania and Special Agent in Charge William F. Sweeney of the FBI's Philadelphia Division made the announcement.

Dmitrij Harder, 43, of Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania, a U.S. legal permanent resident, pleaded guilty to two counts of violating the FCPA
before U.S. District Judge Paul S. Diamond of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Sentencing is scheduled for July 21, 2016.

According to admissions made in connection with Harderâs plea, the EBRD was a multilateral development bank headquartered in London that
was owned by more than 60 sovereign nations and provided financing for development projects in emerging economies, primarily in Eastern
Europe. Harder admitted that between 2007 and 2009, he engaged in a scheme to pay approximately $3.5 million in bribes to an EBRD official
to corruptly influence the officialâs actions on applications for EBRD financing submitted by the Chestnut Groupâs clients and to influence the
official to direct business to the Chestnut Group.

The EBRD ultimately approved applications for financing from two of the Chestnut Groupâs corporate clients; the first resulted in the EBRD
providing an $85 million investment and a 90 million Euro loan, while the second resulted in a $40 million investment and a $60 million
convertible loan, according to the plea. Harder admitted that the Chestnut Group earned approximately $8 million in âsuccess feesâ as a result
of the EBRDâs approval of these two applications.

In a related action, the EBRD official, Andrey Ryjenko, and his sister, Tatjana Sanderson, have been charged by the United Kingdomâs Crown
Prosecution Service and are pending trial. A status conference in that matter is set for June 8, 2016.

The FBI's Philadelphia Division is investigating the case. Assistant U.S. Attorney Michelle Morgan of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and
Senior Trial Attorney Jason Linder of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section are prosecuting the case. The City of London Policeâs Overseas Anti
Corruption Unit and the Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs provided assistance. Germany, Jersey and Guernsey also provided
assistance in this matter.
