INFORMATION
THE UNITED STATES CHARGES:

COUNT ONE
(Conspiracy â 18 U.S.C. Â§ 371)

Introduction

At all times material to this Information:

1. Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (âPDVSAâ) was the Venezuelan state-
owned and state-controlled oil company. PDVSA and its subsidiaries were
responsible for the exploration, production, refining, transportation, and trade in
energy resources in Venezuela and provided funding for other operations of the
Venezuelan government. Bariven S.A. (âBarivenââ) was the PDVSA procurement
subsidiary responsible for equipment purchases. PDVSA and its wholly owned
subsidiaries, including Bariven, were âinstrumentalitiesâ of the Venezuelan
government as that term is used in the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (âFCPAâ),

Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2(h)(2)(A). PDVSA officers and
employees were âforeign officialsâ as that term is used in the FCPA, Title 15,
United States Code, Section 78dd-2(h)(2)(A).

2. At all relevant times, Abraham Jose SHIERA BASTIDAS
(âSHIERAâ), who has been charged separately, was the owner of a number of
other U.S.-based energy companies that supplied equipment and services to
PDVSA, and a resident of the United States, and thus a ââdomestic concernâ and an
officer, director, employee, agent, and shareholder of a âdomestic concernâ as
those terms are used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-
2(h)(1).

3. At all relevant times, Roberto Enrique RINCON FERNANDEZ
(âRINCONâ), who has been charged separately, was the owner of a number of
U.S.-based energy companies, including several companies based in the Southern
District of Texas, that supplied equipment and services to PDVSA, and a resident
of Texas, and thus a âdomestic concernâ and an officer, director, employee, agent,
and shareholder of a âdomestic concernâ as those terms are used in the FCPA, Title
15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2(h)(1). RINCON and SHIERA worked
together on a number of PDVSA contracts and contract bids.

4. Defendant FERNANDO ARDILA RUEDA (âDefendant
ARDILAâ), a resident of Miami-Dade County, Florida, worked as a business

partner of SHIERA and a minority owner of SHIERAâs companies, including a
company headquartered in the Southern District of Texas. Among other things,
Defendant ARDILAâs responsibilities included serving as sales director or
manager for certain of the companies, including generating business for these
companies with PDVSA by approaching and developing relationships with
PDVSA officials. Defendant ARDILA was thus a âdomestic concernâ and an
officer, director, employee, agent, and shareholder of a âdomestic concernâ as
those terms are used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-
2(h)(1).

5. âOfficial H,â an individual whose identity is known to the United
States, was at all relevant times employed by PDVSA or a wholly owned
subsidiary thereof, including as a planning and engineering supervisor. Official
Hâs job responsibilities included helping to select or recommend vendors for
specific PDVSA projects. Official H was a âforeign officialâ as that term is used
in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2(h)(2)(A).

6. âAccountant 1,â an individual whose identity is known to the United
States, worked as an accountant for SHIERAâs companies.

7. âAccountant 2,â an individual whose identity is known to the United

States, worked as an accountant for SHIERAâs companies.
The Conspiracy

8. Beginning in at least 2008 and continuing through at least 2014, in the

Southern District of Texas, and elsewhere, the defendant,
FERNANDO ARDILA RUEDA,

did willfully, that is, with the intent to further the objects of the conspiracy, and
knowingly conspire, confederate, and agree with SHIERA, RINCON, and others
known and unknown, to commit offenses against the United States, that is: being a
domestic concern and an officer, director, employee, agent, and shareholder of a
domestic concern, and together with a domestic concern, to willfully make use of
the mails and means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce corruptly in
furtherance of an offer, payment, promise to pay, and authorization of the payment
of any money, offer, gift, promise to give, and authorization of the giving of
anything of value to a foreign official and to a person, while knowing that all or a
portion of such money and thing of value would be and had been offered, given,
and promised to a foreign official, for purposes of: (i) influencing acts and
decisions of such foreign official in his official capacity; (ii) inducing such foreign
official to do and omit to do acts in violation of the lawful duty of such official;
(iii) securing any improper advantage; and (iv) inducing such foreign official to
use his influence with a foreign government and agencies and instrumentalities
thereof to affect and influence acts and decisions of such government and agencies

their companies, and others in obtaining and retaining business for and with, and

Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2(a).

SHEIRA, RINCON, and their co-conspirators, to enrich themselves by obtaining

fraudulent means, including by paying bribes to PDVSA officials, including, but
not limited to, Official H.

SHIERAâs and RINCONâs companies, that those companies would pay bribes
based on a percentage of any contracts the PDVSA officials helped to award to
SHIERAâs and RINCONâs companies.

13. Defendant ARDILA, together with others, including SHIERA and
RINCON, caused bribe payments to be wired from the bank accounts of
SHIERAâs companies to the bank accounts of PDVSA officials, their relatives, or
other individuals or entities designated by the PDVSA officials who received the
bribes, including to bank accounts in the Southern District of Texas.

Overt Acts

16. In furtherance of the conspiracy and to achieve the objects thereof, at
least one of the co-conspirators committed or caused to be committed, in the
Southern District of Texas and elsewhere, at least one of the following overt acts,
among others:

17. Onor about November 10, 2008, Defendant ARDILA sent an e-mail
to Accountant 1 stating, as translated into English, âWe need to make a payment of
US$74,753.00 to this ally.ââ The co-conspirators frequently referred to the PDVSA
officials to whom they were paying bribes as âaliados,â or, as translated into
English, âalliesâ or âallieds.â For the purpose of concealing the identities of the
PDVSA officials when discussing bribe payments related to the scheme, Defendant
ARDILA and his co-conspirators assigned each official an âaliado number.â

18. Onor about July 13, 2010, Defendant ARDILA sent an e-mail to
Accountant | and SHIERA stating, as translated into English, âAttached, please
find what we have to pay urgently out of the pending amount to the allies.â

19. Onor about September 29, 2011, Defendant ARDILA sent an e-mail
to Accountant 2 stating, as translated into English, âWe need to make a transfer of
US$ 100K to AL_100[the âaliado numberâ for Official H]. Please confirm. Note
that I am going to going to give you 2 accounts for you to divide the transfer

amount into 60 and 40%.â Defendant ARDILA then set forth the account

information for an account in the United States in the name of a relative of Official
H.

20. Onor about October 19, 2011, one of SHIERAâs companies
transferred $40,000 from its account in Panama to the account in the name of
Official Hâs relative described in Paragraph 19 above.

21. Onor about June 4, 2012, Defendant ARDILA wrote to Accountant 1
and SHIERA, stating, as translated into English, âIâm attaching the coordinates for
the first 5|OK$ to be wired to [Official H]...you can make several transfers with
amounts lower than 50K$.â

22. Defendant ARDILA frequently circulated among his co-conspirators
a series of spreadsheets that tracked the bribe payments that were owed to various
PDVSA officials, who were identified on the spreadsheets by nicknames and
âaliado numbers.â Defendant ARDILA generally referred to this spreadsheet as
âSchindlerâs List.â On or about September 9, 2013, Defendant ARDILA sent an
e-mail to Accountant 2 attaching such a spreadsheet and stating, as translated into
English, âPlease find the requested indicators and the updated Schindler list. Be
very careful with this information and do not make any transfer to anyone who

does not have an identifier.â
