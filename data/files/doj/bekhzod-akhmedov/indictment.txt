(Conspiracy to Violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act)
The Grand Jury charges:
OVERVIEW
1. As detailed further below, between in or about 2001 and in or about 2012,

GULNARA KARIMOVA and BEKHZOD AKHMEDOV, the defendants, engaged in an

foreign bribery laws. AKHMEDOV, acting as both an executive of one of the
telecommunications companies and as 4 personal representative of KARIMOVA, solicited and
facilitated the corrupt bribe payments from the three telecommunications companies and their
subsidiaries to shell companies controlled by KARIMOVA, who at the time was an Uzbek

subsidiaries acquired telecommunications licenses, which, under Uzbek law, could not be
purchased or transferred by private entities, and also to allow the telecommunications companies

Case 1:19-cr-O0165-KMW Document i

 

JO3A7/19 Page 7 of 36

Â¢

$420 million in bribes in order to conduct business in Uzbekistan. As described further below,
the bribes were funneled by MTS and Uzdunrobita to KARIMOVA in various ways, including
through business transactions that were made to appear legitimate on their face. In furtherance
of the corrupt scheme, AKHMEDOV and KARIMOVA caused numerous payments to be made
and laundered through multiple bank accounts held in the names of shell companies, including
certain companies controlled by KARIMOVA. Many of the corrupt transactions were routed
into and out of correspondent bank accounts at financial institutions in New York, New York, in
order to promote the ongoing bribery scheme and to conceal the proceeds of that scheme.

22. Beginning in or about the fall of 2001, KARIMOVA and AKHMEDOV hatched a
corrupt scheme to obtain a bribe from the American Company. Specifically, in exchange for
KARIMOVAâs receipt of a 20% ownership interest in Uzdunrobita from the American
Company, KARIMOVA used her influence as an Uzbek government official to facilitate
Uzdunrobitaâs receipt of a telecommunications license and other government benefits in
Uzbekistan. In or about November 2001, KARIMOVA, AKHMEDOV, Associate A, and
representatives of the American Company met in Dubai. At the meeting, KARIMOVA
threatened to cause problems for Uzdunrobita if the American Company did not give
KARIMOVA a 20% stake in Uzdunrobita at no cost to KARIMOVA. KARIMOVA stated that
if KARIMOVA received a stake in Uzdunrobita, then she would obtain a telecommunications
license for Uzdunrobita and provide Uzdunrobita with access to official currency exchange in
Uzbekistan, which would be a significant benefit to the American Company. Subsequently, the
American Company gave a 20% stake in Uzdunrobita to Shell Company A, which executives at

the American Company understood was beneficially owned by KARIMOVA, at no cost.

23,  Inor about early 2002, Uzdunrobita announced that Shell Company A was anew
shareholder and that AKHMEDOV would be Uzdunrobitaâs General Director. With
KARIMOVAâs corrupt assistance, Uzdunrobita obtained a telecommunications license without
going through the official auction process and gained access to official currency exchange in
Uzbekistan. In or about March 2002, KARIMOVA used her corrupt influence to cause
Uzdunrobitaâs other shareholder, the Uzbek government, to cede 31.4% of its stake in
Uzdunrobita to Shell Company A, which was controlled by KARIMOVA, and 10% of its stake
to the American Company for free, which made Shell Company A the majority shareholder of
Uzdunrobita. As a false cover story to conceal the bribe, Shell Company A agreed to provide
purported consulting services and infrastructure to Uzdunrobita as part of the deal. In truth and
in fact, Shell Company A provided no such services.

24.  Jnor about 2004, MTS sought to enter the Uzbek telecommunications market by
acquiring Uzdunrobita. In connection with the Uzdunrobita transaction, MTS paid a $100
million bribe to KARIMOVA. At the time, AKHMEDOV and certain MTS management knew
that Uzdunrobitaâs majority shareholder, Shell Company B, was also beneficially owned by
KARIMOVA. In or about 2003, Shell Company A changed its name and transferred its 51.4%
stake in Uzdunrobita to Shell Company B. In or about July 2004, AKHMEDOV caused MTS to
acquire a 33% stake in Uzdunrobita from Shell Company B, and a 41% stake in Uzdunrobita
from the American Company. As a means of funneling a lucrative bribe payment to
KARIMOVA, AKHMEDOV caused MTS to pay Shell Company B approximately six times as
much per share as MTS paid to the American Company, even though the shares were identical.
Around the same time, MTS and Shell Company B also entered into a Put and Call Option

Agreement (the âOption Agreementâ) pursuant to which MTS had the option to buy, and Shell

Company B had the option to sell, Shell Company Bâs remaining 26% stake in Uzdunrobita for
the fixed price of $37.7 million plus interest during the next three years.

25. Onor about July 26, 2004, MTSâs Board of Directors retroactively approved the
previously executed agreements between MTS and Shell Company B and the American
Company in violation of MTS policies that required Board apptoval before contracts of that
amount were signed. On or about July 29, 2004, MTS transferred approximately $100 million to
an escrow account for the benefit of Shell Company B. On or about August 2, 2004,
KARIMOVA, AKHMEDOV, certain MTS management, executives from the American.
Company, and others attended a deal closing ceremony for MTSâs acquisition of Uzdunrobita.
KARIMOVA presided over the meeting and signed the meeting minutes. On or about August 9,
2004, the escrow agent transferred the approximately $100 million bribe from the escrow
account to Shell Company Bâs bank account in Riga, Latvia, through transactions into and out of
correspondent bank accounts at financial institutions in New York, New York.

26. In or about 2006, KARIMOVA demanded another bribe from MTS through
AKHMEDOV. KARIMOVA told AKHMEDOV, in sum and substance, that she wanted MTS
to pay a higher price for Shell Company Bâs remaining stake in Uzdunrobita than contemplated
under the original Option Agreement. Accordingly, in or about August 2006, KARIMOVA,
AKHMEDOV, and certain MTS management negotiated an amendment to the Option
Agreement as a mechanism for funneling another bribe payment to KARIMOVA. On or about
August 17, 2006, MTS entered into a new agreement with Shell Company B that amended the
terms of the Option Agreement (the âAmended Option Agreementâ). The Amended Option
Agreement eliminated MTSâs call option, extended the time period for Shell Company Bâs put

option, removed the fixed exercise price of $37.7 million plus interest, and instead allowed the
Case 1:19-cr-00165-KMW Document 1

value to be determined by an. international investment bank. Because Uzdunrobitaâs value had.
increased significantly since 2004, in part due to KARIMOVAâs influence, AKHMEDOV and
certain MTS management understood that the Amended Option Agreement conferred significant
corrupt financial benefits to KARIMOVA and did not benefit MTS.

27. On or about April 2, 2007, at least in part due to KARIMOVAâs influence,
UzACI granted Uzdunrobita licenses for additional telecommunications frequencies in
Uzbekistan.

28. On or about April 12, 2007, KARIMOVA and AKHMEDOV caused Shell
Company B to send notice to MTS of Shell Company Bâs intention to exercise its option under
the Amended Option Agreement, and thereby secure the bribe payment for KARIMOVA. On or
about April 27, 2607, MTS and Shell Company B jointly engaged an investment bank to value
Shell Company Bâs remaining share of Uzdunrobita. The bank estimated that 26% of
Uzdunrobita was worth approximately $250 million, including the value of licenses for certain
additional frequencies that UzACI granted to Uzdunrobita in or about April 2007 as a result of
KARIMOVAâs influence. On or about June 26, 2007, MTSâs Board of Directors approved a
$250 million payment to Shell Company B. On or about June 28, 2007, MTS transferred a bribe
of approximately $250 million to Shell Company Bâs bank account in Hong Kong through
transactions into and out of correspondent bank accounts at financial institutions in New York,
New York.

29. Jnor about February 2008, KARIMOVA sought additional bribes from MTS and
Uzdunrobita. Among other things, KARIMOVA demanded that Uzdunrobita extend various
purported loans to KARIMOVA to buy a majority stake in a bank, On or about February i,

2008, an Uzdunrobita executive emailed certain members of MTS and Uzdunrobita

management, including AKHMEDOV and MTS Executive 1, a proposal to have Uzdunrobita
extend loans totaling over $113 million to counterparties controlled by KARIMOVA. When
MTS did not agree to extend the purported loans, KARIMOVA demanded millions of dollars in
additional bribes from AKHMEDOV, MTS, and Uzdunrobita and threatened to interfere with
Uzdunrobitaâs operations in Uzbekistan if the bribes were not paid.

30. In or about the summer and fall of 2008, AKHMEDOV and certain MTS
management arranged to pay an additional $30 million in bribes to KARIMOVA by arranging
for a subsidiary of MTS to enter into a sham contract with Shell Company C, whose beneficial
ownerâas AKHMEDOV and certain MTS management knewâwas KARIMOVA. Under the
contract, an MTS subsidiary agreed to pay Shell Company C a total of approximately $30
million in exchange for a subsidiary of Shell Company Câs repudiation of its ownership of
telecommunications frequencies and the reassignment of those frequencies to Uzdunrobita by
UzACI. On or about August 21, 2008, the MTS subsidiary and Shell Company C executed the
sham contract. Four days later, UzACI issued an order reallocating the frequencies held by Shell
Company Câs subsidiary to Uzdunrobita. On or about September 5, 2008, MTS entered into a
$30 million loan agreement with its subsidiary to fund the agreement between the MTS
subsidiary and Shell Company C. Then, on or about the following dates, MTS or its subsidiary
paid the following bribes, totaling approximately $30 million, to KARIMOVA through Shell
Company Câs bank accounts, which were processed through transactions into and out of

correspondent bank accounts at financial institutions in New York, New York:

31.  Inor about late 2008 and early 2009, certain MTS management, including
AKHMEDOV and MTS Executive 1, discussed the possible acquisition of KOLORIT, an Uzbek
advertising company, as a mechanism by which MTS and Uzdunrobita could funnel additional
bribes to KARIMOVA. At the time, KOLORIT was nominally owned, in part, by a company
affiliated with Associate C, but in reality was owned and controlled by KARIMOVA. On or
about August 7, 2009, certain MTS management received a memo from MTSâs Department of
Strategic Planning recommending rejection of the KOLORIT acquisition because the acquisition
âwas not part of MTSâs âcore businessâ and the estimate for advertising market development was
ânot realistic.â Multiple internal MTS and external valuations of KOLORIT were significantly
less than the recommended purchase price. Nevertheless, in or about August 2009, certain MTS
management, including MTS Executive 1 and AKHMEDOV, approved MTSâs acquisition of
KOLORIT in order to facilitate a bribe payment to KARIMOVA. On or about September 22,
2009, Uzdunrobita funneled the bribe to KARIMOVA by paying the nominal shareholders of
KOLORIT approximately 59.375 billion Uzbek som, or approximately $39,636,711, for the
shares of KOLORIT. On or about September 29, 2009, an MTS subsidiary transferred $17,000
to the account of the company affiliated with Associate C in Uzbekistan, through transactions
into and out of correspondent bank accounts at financial institutions in New York, New York.

32. In or about 2012, KARIMOVA solicited additional bribes from MTS and
Uzdunrobita through AKHMEDOV. Between in or about March 2012 and May 2012,

AKHMEDOV caused Uzdunrobita to pay at least 2.2 billion Uzbek som, or approximately $1.1

12
Case 1:19-cr-00165-KMW Document 1

 

Flied OG/O7/19 Page 13 of 36

million, to purported charities or as sponsorship payments for the benefit of KARIMOVA.
AKHMEDOV caused Uzdunrobita to make these corrupt payments in violation of MTSâs
internal control procedures that required preapproval of such payments.
The VimpelCom and Unitel Bribes

33, From in or about 2005 through in or about 2012, AKHMEDOV conspired with
others to pay more than $114 million in bribes to KARIMOVA in exchange for KARIMOVA
exercising her influence over UzACI to permit VimpelCom and Unitel to operate in
Uzbekistanâs telecommunications market. AKIHMEDOV and others solicited and facilitated
bribe payments to KARIMOVA by certain VimpelCom and Unitel management so that
VimpelCom and Unitel could continue to obtain necessary UzACl approvals to obtain Uzbek
telecommunications business. AKHMEDOV, VimpelCom Executive 1, VimpelCom Executive
2, and others understood that they had to pay KARIMOVA millions of dollars in bribes for
VimpelCom and Unitel to continue to do business in Uzbekistan. In addition, AKHMEDOV
understood that he had to solicit bribe payments from VimmpelCom and. Unitel to benefit
KARIMOVA to ensure that KARIMOVA continued to allow MTS and Uzdunrobita to do
business in Uzbekistan. In furtherance of the scheme, certain co-conspirators used U.S.-based
email accounts to communicate with each other and other individuals. AKHMEDOV and
KARIMOVA caused numerous corrupt payments to be made and laundered through shell
company accounts, with many financial transactions routed into and out of correspondent bank
accounts at financial institutions in New York, New York, in order to promote the ongoing
bribery scheme and conceal the proceeds of that scheme.

34,  Inor about 2005, as part of a plan of expansion into the CIS region, VimpelCom

sought to acquire an Uzbek telecommunications company. VimpelCom considered acquiring

13
Case 1:19-cr-00165-KMW Document 1

 

Flied OG/O7/19 Page 14 of 36

oe

'

two companies: Unitel, the second largest operator in Uzbekistan with approximately 300,000
subscribers; and Buztel, which was a much smaller operator with only approximately 2,500
subscribers. Certain VimpelCom directors and management knew that KARIMOVA held an
indirect interest in Buztel and that acquiring Buztel would ensure KARIMOVAâs support for
VimpelComâs entry into the Uzbek telecommunications market. VimpelCom, through its
subsidiaries, purchased Buztel for approximately $60 million on or about January 18, 2006, and
Unite! for approximately $200 million, along with the assumption of some debt, on or about
February 10, 2006.

35. In connection with VimpelComâs acquisition of Buztel and Unitel, KARIMOVA
solicited bribe payments, through AKHMEDOYV, from VimpelCom in exchange for
KARIMOVAâs support for VimpelComâs entry into the Uzbek market. In an effort to conceal
the bribery scheme, KARIMOVA and AKHMEDOV used Shell Company C as the recipient of
the VimpelCom bribe payments for KARIMOVA. To mask KARIMOVAâs ownership of Shell
Company C, KARIMOVA used other individuals to act as nominee owners and shareholders of
Shell Company C, although in reality, KARIMOVA retained full ownership and control over
Shell Company C. For example, KARIMOVA caused Associate C to hold shares âon trust forâ
KARIMOVA and to grant an âirrevocableâ power of attorney to KARIMOVA for Shell
Company C. |

36. In connection with VimpelComâs acquisition of Unitel and Buztel, AKHMEDOV
arranged for VimpelCom to enter into a partnership with Shell Company C, which certain
VimpelCom management knew was ultimately owned and controlled by KARIMOVA.
KARIMOVA, AKHMEDOV, and certain VimpelCom management structured the partnership

agreement to conceal the bribe payments to KARIMOVA. More specifically, Shell Company C

14
Case 1:19-cr-00165-KMW Document 1

 

Flied OG/O7/19 Page 15 of 36

obtained an indirect interest of approximately 7% in Unitel for $20 million, and Shell Company
C received an option to sell its shares back to Unitel in 2009 for between $57.5 million and $60
million, for a guaranteed net profit of at least $37.5 million. Certain VimpelCom management
justified the option agreementâwhich provided no legitimate financial benefit to VimpelCom
and a significant financial benefit to KARIMOVAâby explaining, in board meeting materials,
that their âpartner,â ie., KARIMOVA, would assist with the â[rJevision of the licensing
agreement for the major licensesâ and âtransfer of frequencies,â while acknowledging that the
direct transfer of frequencies between legal entities was generally not allowed under Uzbek law.

37.  Onor about March 28, 2007, VimpelComâs board unanimously approved the
partnership agreement with Shell Company C. On or about June 12, 2007, Shell Company C
transferred $20 million from its Latvian bank account to VimpelComâs bank account. In or
about September 2009, Shell Company C exercised its guaranteed option to have VimpelComâs
subsidiary repurchase Shell Company Câs shares, and VimpelCom transferred $57.5 million
from its bank account to Shell Company Câs bank account in Hong Kong. Both transfers were
executed through transactions into and out of correspondent bank accounts at financial
institutions in New York, New York. .

38.  Inor about 2007, AKHMEDOV conspired with certain members of
VimpelComâs management to pay KARIMOVA, through Shell Company C, an additional $25
million bribe to obtain 3G frequencies from UzACT for Unitel in Uzbekistan. AKHMEDOV
negotiated with certain VimpelCom management to arrange for the transfer of the 3G licenses
through a sham contract with Shell Company C in order to conceal the corrupt payment to
KARIMOVA. In exchange for the $25 million bribe payment, VimpelCom and Unitel obtained

an amended license within a matter of days, which permitted Unitel to use the 3G frequencies.

AKHIMEDOV served as a go-between for VimpelCom and Unitel management and government
regulators, including a high-ranking official at UzACI, to help close the deal. On or about
November 7, 2007, a VimpelCom subsidiary transferred $10 million from its Netherlands bank
account to Shell Company Câs Latvian bank account. On or about November 9, 2007, a
VimpelCom subsidiary transferred the remaining $15 million from its Netherlands bank account
to Shell Company Câs Latvian bank account, fulfilling VimpelComâs bribe payment to
KARIMOVA. The corrupt payments from the VimpelCom subsidiary to Shell Company Câs
bank account in Riga, Latvia, were executed through transactions into and out of correspondent
bank accounts at financial institutions in New York, New York.

39, In or about 2008, AKHMEDOV agreed with certain VimpelCom management to
pay an additional $2 million bribe to KARIMOVA through a sham consulting agreement with
Shell Company C. On or about February 13, 2008, a VimpelCom executive emailed certain
VimpelCom management to explain that âthe partner fie, KARIMOVA\, citing the earlier
verbal agreements, is returning to the issue [of $2 million] and is asking us to recognize the
obligations and make payments.â Certain VimpelCom management consulted with
AKHMEDOV in order to create fake documents that would contain purported services Shell
Company C could perform under a consulting agreement. Additional aspects of the consulting
arrangement demonstrated its sham nature. For example, at AKHMEDOVâs request,
VimpelCom, not Shell Company C, drafted Shell Company Câs invoice for the work that Shell
Company C purportedly performed, and VimpelCom, not Shell Company C, drafted Shell
Company Câs service acceptance act. In addition, both documents were backdated to July 18,
2008, and the final executed version of the consulting agreement between VimpelCom and Shell

Company C was backdated to June 30, 2008. The final documents, thus, made it falsely appear

16
Case 1:19-cr-00165-KMW Document 1

 

ecogio7/ig Page 17 of 36

that Shell Company C had performed $2 million of purported consulting work for VimpelCom in
only 18 days. In fact, Shell Company C did no legitimate work to justify the $2 million bribe
payment. On or about August 8, 2008, VimpelCom transferred $2 million from its bank account
to Shell Company Câs bank account in Riga, Latvia, which was executed through transactions
into and out of correspondent bank accounts at financial institutions in New York, New York.

40. In or about 2011, VimpelCom paid an additional $10 million bribe through
AKHEMEDOV to KARIMOVA through âresellerâ companies. Because of significant currency
conversion restrictions in Uzbekistan and the inability to use Uzbek som (the Uzbek unit of
currency) to obtain necessary foreign goods, Unitel frequently entered into non-transparent
transactions with purported âresellerâ companies to pay foreign vendors in hard currency for the
provision of goods in Uzbekistan. Typically, Unitel would contract with a local Uzbek company
in Uzbek som, and that Uzbek companyâs related companies located outside of Uzbekistan
would agree to pay an end supplier using the hard currency (usually, U.S. dollars). In or about
February and March 2011, AKHMEDOV agreed with VimpelCom Executive 1, VimpelCom
Executive 2, and others to take advantage of the murky reseller process to conceal a $10 million
bribe to KARIMOVA through various purported reseller transactions. To effectuate the corrupt
payment, Unitel entered into contracts with an Uzbek entity for services that were unnecessary
and/or at highly inflated prices. These transactions were approved without sufficient justification
and bypassed the normal competitive tender processes. Unitel then made payments in Uzbek
som to the Uzbek company. Thereafter, an offshore company affiliated with the Uzbek company
sent approximately 14 payments totaling $10.5 million to another intermediary, which in turn
sent approximately 14 wire payments, each under $1 million and totaling approximately

$10,000,023, to Shell Company Câs Swiss bank account. These wire transfers were executed

17
Case 1:19-cr-00165-KMW Document 1

 

ec ogio7v/ig Page 18 of 36

through transactions into and out of correspondent bank accounts at financial institutions in New
York, New York. Shell Company C performed no legitimate services to justify the $10 million
in payments, which, instead, were simply bribes for KARIMOVA.

41. Inor about 2011, AKHMEDOV agreed with VimpelCom Executive 1,
VimpelCom Executive 2, and others to funnel an additional $30 million bribe payment to
KARIMOVA through Shell Company C. While the purported purpose of the payment was to
acquire 4G mobile communication frequencies for Unitel, the real purpose of the payment was
to enable Unitel to continue to operate in the Uzbek telecommunications market without any
interference by KARIMOVA. AKHMEDOV, VimpelCom Executive 1, VimpelCom Executive
2, and others modeled the 2011 4G agreement on VimpelComâs 3G agreement in 2007, except
that the 2011 4G agreement purportedly was for consulting services and full payment was not
contingent on obtaining the 4G frequencies. At the time, Unitel had no need for 4G frequencies
because Unitel lacked the ability to employ 4G frequencies in Uzbekistan. Certain VimpelCom
management knew that the 4G consulting agreement was a sham and that Shell Company C
would not provide any actual services in return for the $30 million payment. On or about
September 21, 2011, a VimpelCom subsidiary transferred $20 million as an advance payment
under the 4G consulting agreement to Shell Company Câs Swiss bank account. On or about
October 18, 2011, UzACI issued a decision amending Unitelâs license to allow it to use 4G
frequencies. The following day, on or about October 19, 2011, the VimpelCom subsidiary sent
the final $10 million payment to Shell Company Câs Swiss bank account. The corrupt payments
from the VimpelCom subsidiary to Shell Company Câs Swiss bank account were executed
through transactions into and out of correspondent bank accounts at financial institutions in New

York, New York. Shell Company C never provided any legitimate consulting services to Unitel

18
Case 1:19-cr-00165-KMW Document 1

 

Page 19 of 36

to justify the $30 million in payments. In fact, Shell Company Câs consulting reports and
presentations that were prepared under the consulting agreement were not needed by
VimpelCom or Unitel and were largely plagiarized from Wikipedia entries, other internet
sources, and internal VimpelCom documents.

42. nor about 2012, AAHMEDOV agreed with VimpelCom Executive 1,
VimpelCom Executive 2, and others to make another $10 million in bribe payments to
KARIMOVA via Shell Company C through purported transactions with âresellerâ companies.
As in 2011, AXHMEDOV, VimpelCom Executive 1, and VimpelCom Executive 2, knew that
the true purpose of these transactions was to funnel $10 million in corrupt bribes to Shel!
Company C. Between in or about February and May 2012, Unitel entered into contracts, this
time with multiple Uzbek entities for services that were unnecessary and/or at highly inflated
prices. These transactions again were approved without sufficient justification and bypassed the
normal competitive tender processes. Unitel made payments in Uzbek som to those Uzbek
companies. AKHMEDOV then arranged for approximately 13 bribe payments, each under $1
million and totaling approximately $10 million, to be funneled through the âresellerâ companies

_to Shell Company Câs Swiss bank account. These wire transfers were executed through
transactions into and out of correspondent bank accounts at financial institutions in New York,
New York. As in 2011, VimpelCom and Unitel, through VimpelCom Executive 1, VimpelCom
Executive 2, and others, used these reseller transactions to funnel and conceal the $10 million in
bribes to KARIMOVA through Shell Company C. Shell Company C performed no legitimate

services to justify the $10 million in payments.

The Telia and Coscom Bribes

43. From in or about 2007 through in or about 2010, AKHMEDOV conspired with
others to pay approximately $331.2 million in bribes to KARIMOVA in exchange for
KARIMOVA exercising her influence over UzACI to allow Telia to enter and expand Coscomâs
share of the Uzbek telecommunications market. AKHMEDOV solicited and facilitated bribe
payments by certain Telia and Coscom management so that Telia and Coscom could continue to
obtain necessary UzACI approvals and be allowed to obtain and retain Uzbek
telecommunications business. AKHMEDOV, Telia Executive 1, and others understood that they
had to regularly pay KARIMOVA millions of dollars in bribes in order to continue to do
business in Uzbekistan. In addition, AKHMEDOV understood that he had to regularly solicit
bribe payments from Telia and Coscom to benefit KARIMOVA to ensure that KARIMOVA
continued to allow MTS and Uzdunrobita to do business in Uzbekistan. In furtherance of the
bribery scheme, certain co-conspirators used U.S.-based email accounts to communicate with
each other and other individuals to further the scheme. AKHMEDOV and KARIMOVA caused
numerous corrupt payments to be made and laundered through multiple shell company accounts,
with many financial transactions routed into and out of correspondent bank accounts at financial
institutions in New York, New York, in order to promote the ongoing bribery scheme and
conceal the proceeds of that scheme.

44. In or about 2006, Telia sought to acquire a telecommunications company
operating in Uzbekistan. Telia Executive | and certain other Telia management decided to
acquire a U.S.-based telecommunications company that was the parent company of Coscom,
which was already operating in Uzbekistan. After several months of negotiations facilitated by

AKHMEDOV, on or about July 3, 2007, Teliaâs board of directors agreed to acquire Coscom

20
Case 1:19-cr-00165-KMW Document 1

 

Flied OG/O7/19 Page 21 of 36

through a wholly owned subsidiary of Telia for approximately $410 million plus $30 million for
the acquisition of additional assets in Uzbekistan.

45.  Onor about July 4, 2007, Telia Executive 1, signed a partnership agreement on
behalf of Sonera Hungary Holding B.V. (ater renamed. TeliaSonera UTA Holding B.V.), a Telia
subsidiary, with âthe Uzbek Partner,â who was defined in the agreement as AKHMEDOV âor
his nominee.â Telia Executive 1 and other Telia management understood that AKHMEDOV
was acting on behalf of KARIMOVA. The partnership agreement set forth basic terms that later
would be formalized as part of a Shareholders Agreement in December 2007, including that the
Uzbek Partner would receive a net balance of $30 million and shares of Telia Uzbek, the 99.97%
owner of Coscom, with the option to sell the shares back to Telia UTA at a substantial profit for
KARIMOVA. On or about July 16, 2007, Telia completed its acquisition of Coscom through
payments and transfer of ownership.

46. nexchange for KARIMOVA and AKHMEDOVâs support for Teliaâs entry into
the Uzbek telecommunications market through Coscom, KARIMOVA, through AKHMEDOV,
solicited bribe payments from Telia. In or about August 2007 Telia Executive 1 and other Telia
management ordered a Coscom executive to make a corrupt, cash payment of approximately $2
million directly to AKHMEDOV in the lobby of a hotel in Tashkent, Uzbekistan.

47.  Inor about late 2007, Telia arranged, through AKHMEDOYV, the $30 million
bribe to KARIMOVA. On or about November 21, 2007, AKHMEDOV emailed Telia Executive
1 and other Telia management with a proposed payment structure for a bribe based on the
mechanism previously employed by AKHMEDOV on behalf of MTS and VimpelCom.
Specifically, AKHMEDOV arranged a series of sham transactions involving Telia UTA and

Shell Company C, which resulted in KARIMOVAâs receipt of the $30 million bribe payment, an

21
Case 1:19-cr-00165-KMW Document 1

 

indirect 26% ownership interest in Coscom at no cost, and a put option to obtain a much larger
payment at a later date at no cost. That option was a significant benefit to KARIMOVA, but
provided Telia with no legitimate financial benefit.

48.  Inor about 2008, Telia paid an additional $9.2 million in bribes to KARIMOVA
through AKHMEDOV. After AKHMEDOV and Telia management finalized the agreement
with Sheil Company C, certain Telia management traveled to Tashkent to meet with certain
Coscom management and Uzbek government officials between January 6 and 11, 2008.
KARIMOVA met with certain Telia management during their trip to Tashkent. In the summer
of 2008, AKHMEDOV negotiated the bribe for KARIMOVA with certain Telia management,
including Telia Executive 1, which ultimately resulted in a $9.2 million corrupt payment to
KARIMOVA through Shell Company C. The payment purportedly was for Coscom to acquire a
number series of one million telephone numbers and a network code. On or about September 15,
2008, certain Telia management, including Telia Executive 1, received and approved a memo
seeking authorization to execute the agreement with Shell Company C. On ot about September
16, 2008, Telia Uzbek transferred $9.2 million to Shell Company Câs bank account in Riga,
Latvia, through transactions into and out of correspondent bank accounts at financial institutions
in New York, New York.

49, The December 2007 Shareholders Agreement granted Shell Company C the right
to sell back shares of Coscom to Telia UTA after December 31, 2009. On or about January 18,
2010, certain Telia management, including Telia Executive 1, drafted and sent a memorandum to
the Telia board of directors seeking approval to purchase 20% of Shell Company Câs indirect
26% ownership interest for a price not to exceed $220 million. On or about January 25, 2010,

Telia UTA, through certain Telia management, entered into an agreement with Shell Company

22
Case 1:19-cr-00165-KMW Document 1

 

Flied OG/O7/19 Page 23 of 36

C, pursuant to which Shell Company C agreed to sell 20% of its indirect 26% ownership interest
in Coscom for $220 million. In addition, on or about that same day, Telia UTA, Telia Uzbek,
and Shell Company C entered into an Amendment Agreement to the Shareholders Agreement in
which Shell Company C retained the right to sell its remaining 6% ownership interest in Coscom
after February 15, 2013, for a floor price of $50 million. Both agreements were signed by certain
Telia management and by Associate C, on behalf of Shell Company C. On or about February 2,
2010, Telia authorized a payment of $220 million to Shell Company Câs bank account in Hong
Kong, through transactions into and out of correspondent bank accounts at financial institutions
in New York, New York. Telia management authorized the $220 million bribe payment to
KARIMOVA through Shell Company C in order to continue its telecom business in Uzbekistan.
50.  Inor about January 2010, AKHMEDOV solicited Telia for another bribe payment
for KARIMOVA. Over the next few months, AKHMEDOV had multiple discussions with
members of Coscomâs management team about obtaining 4G frequencies in. exchange for bribes
to KARIMOVA. In ot about April 2010, Telia agreed to make a $15 million corrupt payment to
benefit KARIMOVA in order to obtain certain 4G frequencies. The corrupt payment involved
multiple transactions in which Telia agreed to pay $15 million to a third-party vendor to assume
a debt owed to that vendor by a Swiss company that was beneficially owned by KARIMOVA.
To effectuate the corrupt payment, certain Telia management, including Telia Executive 1,
agreed to execute four separate and parallel agreements, which they understood would ultimately
benefit KARIMOVA. Certain Telia management, including Telia Executive 1, handled and
approved the transactions based on discussions and understandings reached with AKHMEDOV,
who they understood to be acting on behalf of KARIMOVA. On or about June 11, 2010, UzACI

issued a decision granting Coscom the right to use certain 4G frequencies that had previously

23
Case 1:19-cr-00165-KMW Document 1

 

Filed OG/07/19 Page 24 of 36

KG

been awarded to, and subsequently waived by, Uzdunrobita. On or about the same day, a
member of Telia management, copying Telia Executive 1, sent AKHMEDOV confirmation of
the payment. On or about June 15, 2010, Telia Uzbek transferred $15 million to the third-party
vendor to satisfy its obligations under the agreements. The $15 million payment was made
through transactions into and out of correspondent bank accounts at financial institutions in New
York, New York.

51. Inor about September 2010, AKHMEDOV began negotiations with certain Telia
management concerning an additional bribe for KARIMOVA through a proposed services
agreement between Shell Company C and Telia Uzbek. On or about October 17, 2010, certain
Telia management, including Telia Executive 1, drafted a proposal for the Telia board of
directors to review, which explained that Shell Company C had offered Coscom additional 4G
frequencies and the opportunity to lease fiber optic network from Uzbektelecom. The cost of the
proposed deal was $75 million, with $20 million payable to Uzbektelecom in return for a 20-year
lease and $55 million payable to Shell Company C. Teliaâs board approved the transaction
during a board meeting on or about October 22, 2010. On or about November 1, 2010, Telia
Uzbek entered into an agreement with Shell Company C, in which Shell Company C agreed to
obtain permission from UzACI for Coscom to use certain 4G frequencies and to execute a long-
term lease agreement with Uzbektelecom. In exchange, Telia Uzbek agreed to pay $55 million
to Shell Company C. The agreement was signed by Associate C on behalf of Shell Company C.
On or about November 26, 2010, UzACI granted Coscom the right to use certain AG frequencies,
which had previously been held and waived by Uzdunrobita. After the 4G frequencies were
granted to Coscom, certain Telia management, including Telia Executive 1, sought to fabricate a

justification for the $55 million bribe payment to Shell Company C, because, unlike with the 3G

24
 

Case 1:19-cr-00165-KMW Document 1 ec ogio7/ig Page 25 of 36

â

frequency transaction, Shell Company C never held the relevant frequencies and, therefore, did
not repudiate them. On or about December 16, 2010, Telia transferred $55 million to Shell
Company Câs Swiss bank account, which was routed through transactions into and out of
correspondent bank accounts at financial institutions in New York, New York.
