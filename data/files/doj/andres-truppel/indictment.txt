(Conspiracy to Commit Bribery, Falsify Corporate Books and
Records, Circumvent Internal Controls, and Commit Fraud)

The Grand Jury charges:

Relevant Entities and Persons

 

1. At all times relevant to this Indictment, Siemens
Aktiengesellischaft (hereafter referred to as âSiemens AG,â and
collectively with its operating groups, divisions, subsidiaries, and
affiliates as âSiemensâ), was an engineering company headquartered
in Munich, Germany that had more than 400,000 employees and
operations in approximately 190 countries worldwide, including the
United States. Siemens AGâs business primarily involved developing,

constructing, selling, and servicing equipment and systems for
national, state, and municipal governments. The company employed
more than 60,000 people in the United States, derived substantial
revenue from sales in the United States, and maintained its U.S.
headquarters in Manhattan, New York.

2. As of March 12, 2001, Siemens AG was listed on the
New York Stock Exchange and was an âissuer,â as that term is used
in the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. See 15 U.S.C. Â§ 78dd-1(a).

3. Siemens AG had a âSupervisory Boardâ anda âManaging
Board,â in accordance with German law. The Supervisory Board, which
served a function similar to that of a U.S. companyâs board of
directors, appointed and removed members of the Managing Board and
oversaw management, but was not permitted to make management
decisions. The Managing Board, or the Vorstand, was responsible for
Managing Siemensâs business operations and generally was comprised
of 10 members. Siemens AG also had a Corporate Executive Committee
(âCECâ), or the Zentral Vorstand, which was comprised of members of
the Managing Board, including the Chief Executive Officer (âCEOâ)
and the Chief Financial Officer (âCFOâ), among select others.
Members of the CEC were assigned advisory responsibility, under the
title of âCoach,â for particular areas and regions of Siemensâs
global business operations and special projects. In turn, senior
executives at the group or regional level provided monthly reports

to the CEC, briefed the CEC on major projects and other matters of

-2-
Case Pit-or-O7056-DLC Document) Filed 2/42/11 Fage 3 of 40

significance, and regularly engaged with the Coach assigned to their
area or region.

4. Siemensâs worldwide operations were carried out by
operating groups of Siemens AG based in Germany, and by an array of
regional Siemens companies situated around the globe.

5. The projects for which Siemens was hired worldwide
were typically run out of Germany by units within the Siemens AG
operating groups, with support, as needed, from regional companies.
These units within the Siemens AG operating groups sometimes took
the form of wholly owned subsidiaries of Siemens AG, and typically
were themselves split into various subdivisions, with names like
âMajor Projects.â The operating group unit subdivisions were
responsible for day-to-day project management, and generally
consisted of two components: a âcommercialâ side, which oversaw the
projectâs administration and finances; anda âtechnicalâ side, which
provided operational oversight. This dual-management structure
served a checks-and-balances function, which was also promoted by
a set of principles and guidelines to which managers adhered in
conducting Siemensâs business. One such rule, known as the â4-eye
principle,â required signatures of two managers, one commercial and
one technical, to authorize third-party disbursements on projects.

6. At all times relevant to this Indictment, Siemens

Business Services GmbH & Co. OGH (âSBSâ), headquartered in Munich,

~ 3 -
Germany, was a wholly owned subsidiary of Siemens AG and a unit in
Siemens AGâs information and communications operating group. SBS
designed, built, operated, maintained, and serviced both discrete
and large-scale information and communication systems for public and
private sector customers around the globe. SBS had its own board
and executive management, including a CEO and CFO, who interacted
with the Managing Board and CEC at Siemens AG headquarters, as well
as with the Coaches assigned either to SBS specifically or to the
region in which SBS was operating a project.

7. At all times relevant to this Indictment, Siemens
Power Transmission and Distribution (âSiemens PTDâ) was a unit in
Siemens AG's power operating group. Siemens PTD designed,
manufactured, sold, and serviced power generation equipment,
software, and network control equipment.

8. At all times relevant to this Indictment, Siemens S.A.
(âSiemens Argentinaâ), based in Buenos Aires, Argentina, was one of
Siemensâs regional companies and a controlled subsidiary of Siemens
AG. Siemens Argentina had its own board and executive management,
including a CEO and CFO, who interacted with the Managing Board and
CEC, as well as with the Coach assigned to the Americas region.
Siemens Argentinaâs principal responsibility was to sell Siemensâs
business services in Argentina, mainly by identifying and securing

contracts for public works projects.

- 4 -
9. At all times relevant to this Indictment, Siemens IT
Services S.A. (âSITSâ) was a special-purpose subsidiary created by
SBS in Argentina for the purpose of bidding for the âDNIâ or Documento

Nacional de Identidad project, which is discussed in further detail

below.

Case Tit-or-O7056-DLC Document) Filed 2/42/11 Fage 9 of 40

Overview of the Conspiracy

18. In or about August 1994, the Government of Argentina
issued a tender for bids to replace an existing system of manually
created national identity booklets with state-of-the-art national
identity cards (the Documento Nacional de Identidad or âDNIâ project).
The total estimated value of the DNI project was approximately $1
billion. After bids for the project were solicited by the Argentine
Ministry of the Interior, Siemens AG, SBS, and Siemens Argentina
organized a multinational consortium to bid on the contract through
SITS. Bids were submitted on or about December 27, 1996, and on or
about February 19, 1998, the President of Argentina issued a decree
awarding the DNI project to SITS. The contract for the DNI project
was executed by SITS and the Ministry of the Interior on or about
October 6, 1998.

19. From in or about 1996 up to and including on or about
August 12, 2009, URIEL SHAREF, HERBERT STEFFEN, ANDRES TRUPPEL,
ULRICH BOCK, EBERHARD REICHERT, STEPHAN SIGNER, CARLOS SERGI, MIGUEL
CZYSCH, the defendants, and others known and unknown, engaged ina
conspiracy on behalf of Siemens to obtain the lucrative proceeds of
the DNI project, and to foster future business, by means of bribery,
fraud, and other forms of corruption. Members of the conspiracy won
the DNI project for Siemens by bribing Argentine government officials.

They paid more bribes in the hope of reviving the project when, in

- 9 -
or about 2001, the DNI project was stalled. Ultimately, and as
discussed in more detail below, the DNI project was terminated
altogether. Even after that point, members of the conspiracy
continued to pursue the profits that Siemens had expected to gain
from the project. They did so through additional bribes and corrupt
conduct, including the pursuit of a fraudulent arbitration in
Washington, D.C. against the Argentine government, demanding nearly
$500 million while actively hiding the corruption from the tribunal.

20. Some of the conspirators were employed by Siemens as
executives, lawyers, and managers working on DNI project matters;
others served as agents and conduits for the payment of bribes to
Argentine government officials who were in a position to influence
the direction of the DNI project. Integral to the conspiracy, and
to the concealment of the illegal objects of the conspiracy, was the
conspiratorsâ use of at least 17 conduit entities (collectively, the
âConduit Entitiesâ) controlled or otherwise affiliated with the
Intermediary Defendants and with various Argentine government
officials and candidates for office who were the recipients or
intended recipients of bribe payments (the âArgentine Officialsâ).

Means and Methods of the Conspiracy

21. Among the means and methods used by URIEL SHAREF,

HERBERT STEFFEN, ANDRES TRUPPEL, ULRICH BOCK, EBERHARD REICHERT,

STEPHAN SIGNER, CARLOS SERGI, MIGUEL CZYSCH, the defendants, and

- 10 -
co-conspirators known and unknown, to achieve the objects of the
conspiracy were the following:

a. using cash and withdrawals of funds from
general-purpose accounts at Siemens AG to make bribe payments and,
thereby, make those illicit transactions more difficult to detect;

b. using deceptive accounting maneuvers to give
bribe payments the appearance of legitimacy and otherwise make those
corrupt transactions more difficult to detect;

Cc. using the Intermediary Defendants and the
Conduit Entities as conduits in transacting bribe payments to
insulate Siemens, the bribe recipients, and the defendants from
potential adverse consequences of the corrupt transactions;

d. transferring funds between and through accounts
held by the Conduit Entities, as well those held by other entities,
to conceal that the funds were to be used in whole and in part to
pay bribes and to conceal the identities of the parties to these
corrupt transactions;

e. creating the illusion that the Intermediary
Defendants were business consultants in connection with the DNI
project, even though the Intermediary Defendants provided no such
consulting services on the DNI project, to give bribe payments the

appearance of legitimacy;

- 11 -
Gase iitt-cr-f?OS6-DLC Document? Filed T2/ie/ii Page t2 of 40

Â£. mischaracterizing bribes in the corporate books
and records of Siemens AG as consulting fees and other seemingly
legitimate expenses;

g. using off-books accounts as a way to conceal
corrupt payments;

h. using accounts controlled by Siemens AG
business divisions and subsidiaries having no connection to the DNI
project as a way to conceal corrupt payments;

i. causing Siemens to enter into consulting
âcontractsâ with many of the Conduit Entities â which were situated
at off-shore locations, such as the Bahamas, the British Virgin
Islands, Guernsey in the Channel Islands, the Cayman Islands, Panama,
Switzerland, and Uruguay â even though these companies provided no
legitimate service to Siemens, on the DNI project or otherwise, to
give bribe payments the appearance of legitimacy;

j- issuing âinvoicesâ to Siemens that requested
payment for services, and authorizing reimbursement for those
services, even though no such services had been provided to Siemens,
on the DNI project and otherwise, to give bribe payments the
appearance of legitimacy;

k. circumventing Siemens AGâs compliance and
ethics program, including internal and external audits aimed at

detecting criminal conduct;

- 12 -
Gase iiti-cr-f?OS6-DLC Bocument? Filed T2/ie/ii Page 13 of 40

1. giving bribe payments the appearance of
legitimacy by disguising them as funds used to settle an arbitration
proceeding before an otherwise legitimate international tribunal;

m. engaging in witness tampering by making payoffs
to witnesses and otherwise obstructing justice to prevent the
exposure of bribery to the public and governmental authorities;

n. engaging in an international money laundering
conspiracy by transferring bribe payments through bank accounts held
in the United States, as more fully described in Count Two;

Q. defrauding the Argentine government of money by
means of materially false and fraudulent pretenses, representations,
and material omissions, as more fully described in Count Three; and

p. concealing the corrupt manner in which Siemens
won the DNI project, concealing the corrupt relationship between
Siemens and the Intermediary Defendants, and concealing evidence of
corruption in international arbitrations.

Initial Bribe Commitments and Payments
22. In or about February 1998, when the DNI project was
initially awarded to Siemens, Co-conspirator #3 and ANDRES TRUPPEL,
the defendant, were respectively CEO and CFO of Siemens Argentina,
and ULRICH BOCK and EBERHARD REICHERT, the defendants, were
respectively the commercial and technical managers of SBSâs Major

Projects subdivision in charge of the DNI project.

- 13 -
Gase iiit-cr-f?OS6-DLC Bocument? Filed T2/ie/ii Page 14 of 40

23. To secure the DNI project for Siemens, Co-conspirator
#3, and co-conspirators known and unknown, committed Siemens to
paying nearly $100 million in bribes to sitting officials of the
Argentine government, members of the opposition party, and
candidates for office who were likely to come to power during the
performance of the project. Central to the negotiation of these bribe
commitments was CARLOS SERGI, the defendant, who helped Siemens form
the consortium that bid for the DNI project, but whose value to the
conspiracy was his access to influential members of the Argentine
government and role as a facilitator, along with MIGUEL CZYSCH, the
defendant, Co-conspirator #5, and Co-conspirator #6, for the payment
of bribes to those officials.

24. During the early stages of the DNI project, up to
approximately late 1999, members of the conspiracy caused Siemens
to pay bribes in partial satisfaction of the commitments caused by
Co-conspirator #3 and facilitated by CARLOS SERGI, the defendant.
Many of these payments were not made pursuant to written contracts,
as was Siemensâs standard business practice for third-party
disbursements on projects. Rather, these payments were made pursuant
to what members of the conspiracy referred to as âblack contractsâ
â that is, unwritten contracts. SERGI and Co-conspirator #3 paid
some of the bribe payments themselves, and later sought reimbursement

from Siemens. Other bribe payments were made through more

- 14 -
Gase iiti-cr-O?OS6-DLC Bocument? Filed T2/ie/ii Page 15 of 40

complicated mechanisms intended to conceal the illicit nature of the
transactions and the identities of the recipients of the funds. For
example:

a. ULRICH BOCK, the defendant, and co-conspirators
known and unknown, made cash withdrawals from Siemens AG
general-purpose accounts in Germany totaling approximately $10
million. BOCK then transported the cash across the border into
Switzerland, and deposited the funds into Swiss bank accounts for
transfer to Argentine government officials. BOCK and others used
cash to make the transaction more difficult to detect.

b. BOCK and EBERHARD REICHERT, the defendant, and
co-conspirators known and unknown, caused SBS to pay millions of
dollars to three of the Conduit Entities (Pepcon Corporation S.A.,
a Costa Rican company, and Mirror Development Inc. and Finli Advisors
Group Inc., both organized under the laws of Panama) under the guise
of invoices for âconsulting servicesâ purportedly rendered by the
three Conduit Entities in Chile, Brazil, and Mexico, respectively,
in connection with the DNI project. In truth, the purported
âconsulting servicesâ were neither performed nor relevant to the DNI
project. The payments to Pepcon Corporation S.A. were intended as
bribe payments to a senior official in the Office of the President
in the 1980s and 1990s and a candidate for office and member of the

Argentine Congress at various points in the 2000s (âArgentine

- 15 -
Gase tiit-or-OiOS6-DLC Bocument? Filed l2f_e/ii Page 16 of 40

Official Aâ); the payments to Mirror Development Inc. were intended
as bribe payments to a senior official in the Ministry of the Interior
in the 1990s and a member of the Argentine Congress in the late 1990s
and early 2000s (âArgentine Official Bâ); and the payments to Finli
Advisors Group Inc. were intended as bribe payments to a senior
official in the Ministry of Migration and the Office of Internal
Security in the 1990s, and a member of the Argentine Congress in the
2000s (âArgentine Official Câ).

Cc. BOCK, REICHERT, ANDRES TRUPPEL, the defendant,
and co-conspirators known and unknown, caused SBS to transfer two
wires in the aggregate amount of approximately $7.4 million to a bank
account in Manhattan, New York, ostensibly to settle a foreign
exchange hedging contract with a foreign currency company organized
under the laws of the Bahamas and not named in this Indictment
(âCompany #1â). The payments were charged to the DNI project, even
though the hedging contract served no legitimate business purpose.
In reality, the hedging transaction was a device to conceal bribes
to some of the Argentine Officials.

25. In or about 1998 and 1999, ULRICH BOCK, EBERHARD
REICHERT, ANDRES TRUPPEL, the defendants, and co-conspirators known
and unknown, also caused Siemens to make millions of dollars of
payments to CARLOS SERGI and MIGUEL CZYSCH, the defendants, and other

intermediaries. These payments, which were transferred through

- 16 -
Gase iitt-cr-O?OS6-DLC Bocument? Filed T2/ie/it Page 1? of 40

Conduit Entities, were intended to be bribe payments to several of
the Argentine Officials, in partial satisfaction of bribe
commitments and to reimburse SERGI for bribe payments he had
previously advanced to several of the Argentine Officials; and
otherwise to facilitate the conspiracy. For example, members of the
conspiracy caused SBS to make transfers of 1,850,000 deutschmarks
and 3,582,000 Swiss francs (the equivalent of more than $3.6 million)
to Masters Overseas Corporation, a Conduit Entity organized under
the laws of the British Virgin Islands, and two payments in the
aggregate amount of approximately $15 million to Air Traffic Control
Corporation, a Conduit Entity organized under the laws of the Cayman
Islands. Siemens Argentina also paid Co-Conspirator #1, a former
senior official in the Argentine Ministry of Justice, a fee of $5
million dollars to set up shell companies through which bribes would
be paid to the Argentine Officials.

Bribe Commitments to Officials of the New Administration

And the Consolidation of Prior Bribe Commitments
For Payment Under a âWhite Contractâ

26. In or about May 1999, with work on the DNI project
underway, the Government of Argentina suspended the project, as the
country faced a mounting economic crisis anda presidential election.
A new administration, which came to power in or about December 1999,

maintained the suspended status of the DNI project.

-~17 -
Gase tiit-or-OiOS6-DLC Bocument? Filed l2f_e/ii Page 18 of 40

27. In or about early 2000, Siemens AGâs CEC exercised
increased control over business matters in Argentina. HERBERT
STEFFEN, the defendant, was assigned oversight responsibility for
matters in Argentina, with instructions to continue the DNI project
at âwhatever the cost,â according to an internal Siemens document.
At the time, STEFFEN was a senior executive at Siemens AG in Germany,
but he had served as CEO of Siemens Argentina in the 1980s and chairman
of that company for over a decade, during which time he had developed
substantial Argentine government contacts. Then, later in 2000,
URIEL SHAREF, the defendant, who had substantial experience with
Siemensâs business interests in Latin America, was appointed to the
Managing Board and CEC and given oversight responsibilities, as Coach,
for operations in the Americas, including Argentina and the DNI
project.

28. URIEL SHAREF and HERBERT STEFFEN, the defendants, led
a campaign on Siemensâs part to restart the DNI project.
Renegotiation of the contract governing the DNI project was a part
of the campaign. STEFFEN lobbied Argentine government officials,
as did ULRICH BOCK, EBERHARD REICHERT, and ANDRES TRUPPEL, the
defendants. In mid-December 2000, SHAREF met in Buenos Aires with
a senior official in the office of the Argentine President

(âArgentine Official Dâ). The meeting engendered optimism at Siemens

- 18 -
Gase iitt-cr-O?OS6-DLC Bocument? Filed T2/ie/ii Page 19 of 40

that the President of Argentina would soon issue a decree authorizing
the resumption of the DNI project.

29. Continuing the payment of bribes was part of the
conspiratorsâ effort to revive the DNI project. In or about the Fall
of 2000, as the negotiations over the contract progressed, HERBERT
STEFFEN, ANDRES TRUPPEL, ULRICH BOCK, EBERHARD REICHERT, CARLOS
SERGI, MIGUEL CZYSCH, the defendants, and co-conspirators known and
unknown, discussed the subject of bribes in meetings in Germany and
Argentina. At these meetings, the conspirators caused Siemens, and
SBS specifically, to commit to satisfying a significant portion of
the balance of prior bribe obligations to Argentine Officials A, B,
and C, among other officials, and to commit to paying additional
bribes to officials of the new Administration, including Argentine
Official D, a senior official in the Ministry of the Interior in the
early 2000s and a member of the Argentine Congress in the mid-2000s
(âArgentine Official Eâ), a senior official in the Ministry of the
Interior in the early 2000s and a candidate for office in the
Argentine Congress in the mid-2000s (âArgentine Official Fâ), and
a senior official in the Ministry of Interior in the early 2000s
(âArgentine Official Gâ).

30. At these meetings, the conspirators also discussed
the manner in which the bribes would be paid. They agreed to funnel

payments on all existing and new bribe obligations through the

- 19 -
Case tiit-er-OiOS6-DLC Bocument? Filed l2f_e/ii Page 20 of 40

Intermediary Defendants. They also agreed to conceal the bribe
payments under a âwhite contractâ âthat is, a contract that appeared
legitimate on its face, but which did not reflect an actual
transaction of business. Specifically, the conspirators agreed to
consolidate a portion of the bribe obligations into a sham $27 million
contract between SBS and Mfast Consulting AG (âMfastâ), one of the
Conduit Entities controlled by the Intermediary Defendants (âthe
Mfast Contractâ). Members of the conspiracy preferred this âwhite
contractâ device to the prior practice of making payments under
so-called âblack contractsâ that did not exist at all. By hiding
the payment of bribes through a sham contract with one of the Conduit
Entities, the conspirators made it more difficult for the conspiracy
to be discovered.

31. In or about January 2001, the Mfast Contract was
executed by ULRICH BOCK and EBERHARD REICHERT, the defendants, on
behalf of SBS, and by Co-conspirator #6, on behalf of Mfast.
Co-conspirator #5 had participated in creating the contract. The
contract described services on the DNI project that purportedly had
already been performed by Mfast, but in reality those services had
not actually been performed and were not expected to be performed.

32. By in or about March 2001, the anticipated decree
authorizing the resumption of the DNI project still had not issued.

The Argentine government was instead conducting an assessment of the

-~ 20 -
Gase iiti-cr-f?OS6-DLC Bocument? Filed T2/ie/it Page 21 of 40

merits of continuing the DNI project through a body called
Sindicarura General de la NacidÃ©n (the General Accounting Agency of
the Nation, referred to hereafter as âSIGENâ).

33. Ina further effort to prevent termination of the DNI
project, members of the conspiracy determined to influence SIGENâs
assessment in Siemensâs favor by bribing a SIGEN board member
(âArgentine Official Hâ). To this end, ANDRES TRUPPEL and EBERHARD
REICHERT, the defendants, caused SBS to pay nearly $1 million to
Co-Conspirator #2, an attorney and former official in the Argentine
Ministry of Justice who, as TRUPPEL understood, was a close friend
of Argentine Official H. The bribe payments were disguised as
lobbying expenses.

The Crisis Management Team and the Response to the Termination

34. Despite Siemensâs efforts and bribe payments
intended for various foreign officials, the Government of Argentina
officially terminated the DNI project in or about May 2001. Siemens
AG responded at the CEC level: URIEL SHAREF, the defendant, who was
a CEC member and Coach of the Americas region, assembled a âCrisis
Management Teamâ (âCMTâ), consisting of SBS and Siemens Argentina
managers and Siemens AG lawyers. SHAREF assigned overall
responsibility for coordinating the CMTâs activities to
Co-conspirator #4, an in-house lawyer for Siemens, and the SBS

manager in charge of the DNI project, STEPHAN SIGNER, the defendant,

- 21 -
Gase iitt-cr-O?OS6-DLC Bocument? Filed T2/ie/ii Page 22 of 40

who had effectively replaced ULRICH BOCK, the defendant, who was in
semi-retired status. ANDRES TRUPPEL, the defendant, and
co-conspirators not named as defendants in this Indictment, were also
named to the CMT. In addition, SHAREF directed that HERBERT STEFFEN,
the defendant, would provide necessary support to the CMTâs efforts.

35. In furtherance of the conspiracy, the conspirators
- acting through the CMT and otherwise - continued the bribe scheme
to (i) ensure that Siemens recognized the economic benefits of the
contract for the DNI project, notwithstanding its termination and
the corrupt manner by which it had been procured, (ii) prevent public
disclosure of the bribery associated with the DNI project, and (iii)
ensure Siemensâs ability to secure future government contracts in
Argentina and elsewhere in the region. The conspirators sought to
achieve these related goals by paying down outstanding bribe
obligations to Argentine Officials through a complex series of
transactions, paying down bribe obligations through a sham
arbitration in Switzerland, and seeking to recoup the anticipated
financial benefits of the DNI project through a fraudulent
arbitration in Washington, D.C.

Payments of the Outstanding Bribe
Obligations through Complex Transactions

36. On or about July 5, 2001, ANDRES TRUPPEL and ULRICH
BOCK, the defendants, met in Miami, Florida, with CARLOS SERGI and

MIGUEL CZYSCH, the defendants, to re-negotiate the amount of the
- 22 -
Gase tiit-er-OiOS6-DLC Bocument? Filed l2f_e/ii Page 23 of 40

outstanding bribe commitments to the Argentine Officials. TRUPPEL
and BOCK agreed to seek payment of this amount from SBS through the
previously executed Mfast Contract.

37. Payment of additional bribes proved more difficult
than anticipated, however, because of Siemensâs own internal
controls. To circumvent those controls, members of the conspiracy
were forced to employ less direct means of payment. Ultimately, they
succeeded, causing Siemens to pay more than $28 million to the
Argentine Officials and the Intermediary Defendants between in or
about 2002 and in or about 2007. Three of the payments towards the
outstanding bribe debt were as follows:

- $5.2 million, in or about July 2002;

- $9.5 million, in or about April and July 2003; and

~ $4.7 million, in or about January and February 2004.

The July 2002 Partial Payment of $5.2 Million

38. In or about July 2002, the conspirators caused SBS
to pay approximately $5.2 million to the Argentine Officials and the
Intermediary Defendants. The payment was made through Meder Holding
Corporation S.A. (âMederâ), a company registered in Uruguay that was
associated with ANDRES TRUPPEL, the defendant, and through bank
accounts held by the Conduit Entities. The conspirators used
fictitious invoices and an illusory consulting contract to give the

payments the appearance of legitimacy. In or about May 2002, TRUPPEL

- 23 -
sent to STEPHAN SIGNER, the defendant, a series of four Meder invoices
that requested payment for âmarket development in Chile and Uruguay,â
and provided wire transfer instructions for payment through a bank
account in Manhattan, New York. Even though SBS had not sought or
contemplated Mederâs services, in or about June 2002 an SBS manager
executed a consultancy contract with Meder, which was backdated to
on or about October 3, 2000, to make it appear that services had
previously been provided, even though no services were provided at
any time. Thereafter, payment was made to Meder, pursuant to Mederâs
invoices, through the New York-based account. Once the payment
reached Meder, a significant portion of the money was forwarded
through bank accounts in Manhattan, New York, to accounts held
elsewhere by Milmar Ltd. and Pine Top Corporation, two of the Conduit
Entities. Milmar Ltd. was a company organized under the laws of the
British Virgin Islands. It was associated with addresses in the
British Virgin Islands and two addresses in Miami, Florida. One of
the Miami addresses â a residential ranch-style house â was the same
address with which Masters Overseas Corporation and Tidwell
Investments S.A., two other Conduit Entities, were associated.

Plans for Payment of the Balance of the Outstanding
Bribe Obligations

39. The Meder payment was only a partial payment of the

outstanding bribe obligations, and CARLOS SERGI, the defendant,

- 24 -
Gase tiit-er-OiOS6-DLC Bocument? Filed l2âf_e/ii Page 25 of 40

continued to put pressure on other members of the conspiracy to pay
the remaining debt.

40. In or about August 2002, HERBERT STEFFEN and ANDRES
TRUPPEL, the defendants, met in Madrid, Spain with CARLOS SERGI, the
defendant, and Argentine Official C. After the meeting, TRUPPEL and
STEFFEN faxed a handwritten note to URIEL SHAREF, the defendant,
explaining that âthe situation with respect to the familiar themes
{had] reached a critical point again,â and that the âplan to gain
time using certain strategies [was] apparently failing.â A month
later, SERGI sent a letter to SHAREF urging Siemens to make additional
payments, suggesting that the payments would help Siemens secure
âfuture projects,â and offering to mediate the dispute with the
âclientâ âa reference to the Argentine Officials. By a second letter,
in December 2002, SERGI asked SHAREF to meet with him in January 2003
and warned of âdamage to the image and good reputationâ of Siemens
if it did not come up with a âproper solution.â

41. On or about January 15, 2003, URIEL SHAREF, the
defendant, traveled to Manhattan, New York, in part to discuss the
outstanding bribe obligations with CARLOS SERGI, the defendant.
Within a week, SHAREF met with HERBERT STEFFEN and ANDRES TRUPPEL,
the defendants, in Munich, Germany, to prepare them for a meeting
soon thereafter with SERGI and Argentine Official C. SHAREF

instructed STEFFEN and TRUPPEL to appease SERGI and Argentine

- 25 -
Gase tiit-cr-OiOS6-DLC Bocument? Filed l2f_e/ii Page 26 of 40

Official C by assuring them that SHAREF himself would authorize
additional bribe payments, and that SHAREF would be amenable to using
as a mechanism for partial payment an arbitration claim that SERGI
was threatening to bring in Switzerland against SBS for breach of
the Mfast Contract.

Payment of $9.5 Million

42. Meanwhile, however, more immediate action needed to
be taken. In or about mid-February 2003, SERGI warned TRUPPEL and
STEFFEN, by letter, that if Siemens did not satisfy the outstanding
bribe obligations by making additional payments, âwe will forgo the
confidentiality requested by the Company from the start of the
project for its entire duration,â adding that this âmight well be
detrimental to the image of the Corporation and its managers.â SERGI
was more blunt in a note attached to the letter, threatening to upend
Siemens AG's arbitration claim in Washington, D.C. by exposing the
bribery. For example, SERGI wrote that the âquestionable procedures
and criticism of the competitive bidding . . . [would] doubtlessly
generate a problem at public sector level that would make a positive
resolution of the claim by Siemens filed in Washington against the
Argentine Government impossible, and result in a loss for the
Company.â TRUPPEL forwarded the letter and note to SHAREF,
suggesting that the missives were indicative of the âpressure we are

under.â

43. Inor about early March 2003, to satisfy CARLOS SERGI,
the defendant, and the Argentine Officials, URIEL SHAREF and ANDRES
TRUPPEL, the defendants, orchestrated a complex transaction
involving two Siemens AG operating groups, an entity in Dubai, United
Arab Emirates (âCompany #2â), and two of the Conduit Entities with
bank accounts in the Bahamas, all of which resulted ina set of
disguised transfers, in the aggregate amount of approximately $9.5
million, from Siemens to the Argentine Officials and the Intermediary
Defendants in April and July 2003. SHAREF initiated the transaction
by directing that a payment be arranged by Siemens PTD, a division
of Siemens AG's power operating group. SHAREF was the CECâs Coach
for the power operating group, as he was for the Americas region.
Company #2, using wiring instructions provided by TRUPPEL,
transferred funds in a corresponding amount to bank accounts held
in the Bahamas by Chatarella Investors Ltd. and Rockney Consultants
Ltd., two of the Conduit Entities. Siemens PTD reimbursed Company
#2 for the payments, disguising them as payments related to a project
in China. Over the next several months, at SHAREFâS direction,
Siemens PTD recouped the payment from SBS, through a series of
fictitious credits for services that were not actually performed.
In or about December 2003, STEPHAN SIGNER, the defendant, told

Co-conspirator #4 that approximately $10 million had been paid to

- 27 -
Gase tiit-er-OiOS6-DLC Bocument? Filed l2f_e/ii Page 28 of 40

the âfriendsâ of the Intermediary Defendants â that is, the Argentine
Officials.

Payment of $4.7 Million

44, In late January and early February 2004, members of
the conspiracy reduced the outstanding bribe obligation even further
by causing SBS to make four more payments, in the aggregate amount
of approximately $4.7 million, to the Argentine Officials and the
Intermediary Defendants. The payments were transferred to bank
accounts held by four of the Conduit Entities â Consultora Neelrey
S.A of Uruguay, Linfarm Inc. S.A. of Uruguay, Rodmarton Ltd. of the
British Virgin Islands, and Silverlinks Company Ltd. of Guernsey in
the Channel Islands â all of which were controlled by the Intermediary
Defendants and other intermediaries. ANDRES TRUPPEL and STEPHAN
SIGNER, the defendants, and co-conspirators known and unknown, used
backdated invoices for phantom services to make the payments look
like legitimate business expenditures.

The Partial Payment of $8.8 Million, Disguised
As a Settlement of SERGIâs Swiss Arbitration Claim

45. CARLOS SERGI, the defendant, filed a formal claim on
behalf of Mfast against SBS in a Swiss arbitral tribunal on or about
March 15, 2005. The stated purpose of the arbitration was to enforce
the Mfast Contract. Although the members of the conspiracy knew that
none of the services described in the Mfast contract were performed

and were not expected to be performed, and that the Mfast Contract
- 28 -
Gase tiit-er-OiOS6-DLC Bocument? Filed l2f_e/ii Page 29 of 40

was a sham used to disguise illegal bribe obligations, none of the
conspirators acknowledged as much before the Swiss tribunal.

46. To the contrary, URIEL SHAREF and URLICH BOCK, the
defendants, provided testimony before the arbitral tribunal in which
they omitted any mention of bribery, and STEPHAN SIGNER, the
defendant, and Co-conspirator #4 otherwise caused Siemens to prevent
disclosure of any evidence of corruption in the proceedings. For
example, SIGNER arranged to have BOCK, who had retired from Siemens
by the time of the Swiss arbitration, paida âconsultingâ fee of more
than $300,000 in exchange for giving testimony in the Swiss and
Washington, D.C. arbitrations that omitted mention of bribery. As
BOCK would later acknowledge in an email requesting payment of his
âconsultingâ fee, âI have arranged my witness statements ... in
such a way that Siemens is protected from damage. ."

47. In or about October 2006, URIEL SHAREF and STEPHAN
SIGNER, the defendants, Co-conspirator #4, and co-conspirators known
and unknown, caused SBS to settle Mfastâs claim for approximately
$8.8 million. Although an arbitration settlement on its face, the
settlement was actually a mechanism to disguise a partial payment
of bribe obligations to the Argentine Officials.

48. On or about January 16, 2007, SBS caused a wire
transfer of the settlement amount into a Swiss bank account

controlled by attorneys for Mfast. The next day, substantially the

- 29 -
Case tiit-er-OiOS6-DLC Bocument? Filed T2âf_e/ii Page 30 of 40

same amount was transferred to two of the Conduit Entities associated
with CARLOS SERGI, the defendant, and other intermediaries, through
bank accounts in Manhattan, New York.

The Washington, D.C. Arbitration

49. In furtherance of the conspiracy, URIEL SHAREF and
STEPHAN SIGNER, the defendants, Co-conspirator #4, and other members
of the Crisis Management Team, orchestrated the filing of a
fraudulent arbitration claim in Washington, D.C., in May 2002 to
cause the Argentine government to pay Siemens AG damages in an amount
equivalent to incurred expenses and the total profits the company
would have earned from the DNI project had it not been terminated.
Siemens AGâs claim was brought pursuant toa treaty between Argentina
and Germany that protected the business investments of the parties
and companies organized under their laws. Exposure of the bribery
associated with the DNI project would have likely rendered the
arbitration claim futile because the contract would have been
procured through illegal corruption.

50. The Swiss arbitration settlement also preserved the
merits of Siemens AGâs arbitration claim in Washington, D.c. Of
critical importance to the conspirators was a provision in the
settlement agreement that expressly barred CARLOS SERGI and MIGUEL
CZYSCH, the defendants, and Co-conspirator #5 from âinvolv [ing]

themselves in [the Washington, D.C. arbitration] proceedings, either

- 30 -
Gase iitt-cr-O?OS6-DLC Bocument? Filed T2/ie/ii Page oi of 40

directly or indirectly, or in any other manner influenc[ing] said
proceedings, even if only by passing on information.â Once the
settlement had been reached, Co-conspirator #4 sent an email to URIEL
SHAREF, the defendant, stating that a major objective of the defense
of the Swiss arbitration had been achieved: avoiding âcontaminationâ
of Siemens AGâs arbitration in Washington, D.C. Co-conspirator #4
further explained that the settlement agreement would require
âabsolute silenceâ in that arbitration proceeding.

51. For nearly three years, URIEL SHAREF and STEPHAN
SIGNER, the defendants, Co-conspirator #4, and other members of the
Crisis Management Team successfully kept evidence of bribery out of
the arbitration in Washington, D.C. The conspirators accomplished
this by filing a claim and supporting evidence, including witness
statements of ANDRES TRUPPEL and ULRICH BOCK, the defendants, which
contained material misrepresentations and omissions relating to the
DNI projectâs origins, among other matters. As a result, in or about
August 2004, the arbitral tribunal determined that jurisdiction
existed to decide Siemens AGâs claim. In or about June 2005, however,
SHAREF and Co-conspirator #4 were tipped off by an executive at
Siemens Argentina that a high-ranking Argentine official had begun
talking about how the DNI project bidding process was corrupted. A
few months later, Argentina sought to raise a defense based on

corruption; it made reference in its filing to a pending Argentine

- 31 -
Gase tiit-er-OiOS6-DLC Bocument? Filed l2fe/ii Page S2 of 40

corruption investigation. SHAREF, SIGNER, Co-conspirator #4, and
co-conspirators known and unknown, caused Siemens AGâs attorney to
flatly deny the allegation. Ina letter filed in the arbitration,
the attorney wrote that âthe insinuations of corruption intended by
Argentina against Siemens and SITS through the filing of these
documents are completely false.â

52. The arbitral tribunal sided with Siemens AG, and on
or about February 6, 2007, it awarded Siemens AG $217, 838,439 in loss
of investment, plus interest of 2.66% compounded annually. (On or
about August 12, 2009, Siemens AG personnel who were not members of
the conspiracy caused the company to waive its right to the award.)

Statutory Allegations

August 12, 2009, inthe Southern District of New York and elsewhere,
