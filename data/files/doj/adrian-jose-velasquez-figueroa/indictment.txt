two consecutive National Treasurers in Venezuela, Alejandro Andrade Cedeno and CLAUDIA

and the proceeds of this and other schemes.

foreign currency exchanges for the Venezuelan government and securing an improper advantage
in acquiring the right to conduct such exchange transactions.

RAUL GORRIN BELISARIO to CLAUDIA PATRICIA DIAZ GUILLEN and promoting the
continuation of the bribery scheme with CLAUDIA PATRICIA DIAZ GUILLEN.

Andrade Cedeno and CLAUDIA PATRICIA DIAZ GUILLEN, including payments made to
and through ADRIAN JOSE VELASQUEZ FIGUEROA for the benefit of CLAUDIA
PATRICIA DIAZ GUILLEN, and further caused his employees to email updated spreadsheets
to RAUL GORRIN BELISARIO, Alejandro Andrade Cedeno, and ADRIAN JOSE
VELASQUEZ FIGUEROA reflecting the changes as certain payments were made.
