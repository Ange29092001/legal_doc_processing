Re: General Cable Corporation Criminal Investigation
Dear Mr. Sitarchuk:

The United States Department of Justice, Criminal Division, Fraud Section (the âFraud
Sectionâ) and General Cable Corporation (âGeneral Cableâ or the âCompanyâ) pursuant to
authority granted by General Cableâs Board of Directors, enter into this Non-Prosecution
Agreement (âAgreementââ).

The Fraud Section enters into this Agreement based on the individual facts and
circumstances presented by this case and the Company, including:

a) the Company received voluntary self-disclosure credit because it voluntarily and
timely disclosed to the Fraud Section the conduct described in the Statement of Facts attached
hereto as Attachment A (the âStatement of Factsâ);

b) the Company received full credit for its cooperation with the Fraud Sectionâs
investigation, which included conducting a thorough internal investigation; making regular factual
presentations and proactively providing updates to the Fraud Section; voluntarily making foreign-
based employees available for interviews in the United States; producing documents, including
translations, to the Fraud Section from foreign countries in ways that did not implicate foreign
data privacy laws; collecting, analyzing, and organizing voluminous evidence and information for
the Fraud Section; and identifying, investigating, and disclosing conduct to the Fraud Section that
was outside the scope of its initial voluntary self-disclosure;

c) by the conclusion of the investigation, the Company had provided to the Fraud
Section all relevant facts known to it, including information about individuals and third parties
involved in the misconduct;

 

 
d) the Company has enhanced and has committed to the Fraud Section to continue to
enhance its compliance program and internal controls, including ensuring that its compliance
program satisfies the minimum elements set forth in Attachment B to this Agreement (Corporate
Compliance Program); the Company has engaged in extensive remedial measures, specifically by:
(1) terminating the employment or accelerating the previously-planned departures and
resignations of 13 employees who participated in the misconduct, (2) causing the resignation of 2
employees and accelerating the previously-planned departure of an additional employee who
failed to supervise effectively others who were engaged in the misconduct described in the
Statement of Facts, (3) causing the resignation of an additional employee who failed to take
appropriate steps in response to identifying the misconduct; (4) terminating the business
relationships with 47 third-party agents and distributors who participated in the misconduct
described in the Statement of Facts; (5) hiring a Chief Compliance Officer who has an executive
officer position in the Company and separate reporting lines to the CEO and Audit Committee of
the Board of Directors; (6) conducting a global and enterprise-wide risk assessment and
evaluation; (7) developing and implementing a risk mitigation plan for risks identified through the
assessment and evaluation; (8) developing a comprehensive compliance program that integrates
business functions into compliance leadership roles, is designed to deliver clear and consistent
communications and expectations Company-wide through policies and procedures, and includes
frequent leadership communications to all employees; (9) revamping the ethics and compliance
helpline; (10) delivering tailored face-to-face compliance training, including training on the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (âFCPAâ), to the Board of Directors and senior executives, Internal
Audit personnel, sales leaders, and all salaried employees; (11) adopting heightened controls on
the selection and use of third parties, including building a system for third-party due diligence that
assigns ownership to business personnel to shepherd prospective third parties through a
comprehensive risk assessment, review, and approval process; (12) issuing, and providing training
on, business amenities policies specific to certain countries; and (13) conducting on-site global
compliance audits to test adherence to enhanced controls and procedures;

e) based on the Companyâs remediation and the state of its compliance program, and
the Companyâs agreement to report to the Fraud Section as set forth in Attachment C to this
Agreement (Corporate Compliance Reporting), the Fraud Section determined that an independent
compliance monitor was unnecessary;

f) the Company has agreed to continue to cooperate with the Fraud Section in any
ongoing investigation of the conduct of the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates and their
officers, directors, employees, agents, business partners, distributors, and consultants relating to
violations of the FCPA;

g) the nature and seriousness of the offense conduct, including that certain high-level
executives responsible for overseeing international operations and employees of the Company
knowingly and willfully failed to implement adequate internal accounting controls over payments
to third parties despite knowing that third parties were making illegal payments; the illegal
payments occurred in at least five separate countries and over a ten-year span; and the profits to
the Company exceeded $50 million; and

 
hk) accordingly, after considering (a) through (e) above, the Company received an

materials as the Fraud Section, in its sole discretion, shall deem appropriate.

In addition, during the Term of the Agreement, should the Company learn of any evidence
or allegation of conduct that would be a possible violation of the FCPA anti-bribery or accounting
provisions had the conduct occurred within the jurisdiction of the United States, the Company

United States Treasury within ten business days of the execution of the Agreement, and to pay
$51,174,237 in disgorgement of profits plus prejudgment interest. The monetary penalty is based.
upon profits of $51,174,237 as a result of the corrupt scheme, and reflects a discount of 50%-off
of the bottom of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines fine range. The Fraud Section will credit the
disgorgement paid by the Company to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in

4

 

 
connection with its resolution of this matter. The Company acknowledges that no tax deduction
may be sought in connection with the payment of any part of the $20,469,694.80 penalty. The
Company shall not seek or accept directly or indirectly rembursement or indemnification from
any source with regard to the penalty or disgorgement amounts that the Company pays pursuant to
this Agreement or any other agreement concerning the facts set forth in the Statement of Facts
entered into with an enforcement authority or regulator.

The Fraud Section agrees, except as provided herein, that it will not bring any criminal or
civil case (except for criminal tax violations, as to which the Fraud Section does not make any
agreement) against the Company or any of its present or former parents or subsidiaries relating to:
(1) any of the conduct described in the attached Statement of Facts. The Fraud Section, however,
may use any information related to the conduct described in the attached Statement of Facts
against the Company: (a) in a prosecution for perjury or obstruction of justice; (b) in a prosecution
for making a false statement; (c) in a prosecution or other proceeding relating to any crime of -
violence; or (d) in a prosecution or other proceeding relating to a violation of any provision of
Title 26 of the United States Code. This Agreement does not provide any protection against
prosecution for any future conduct by the Company or any of its present or former subsidiaries. In
addition, this Agreement does not provide any protection against prosecution of any individuals,
regardless of their affiliation with the Company.

If, during the Term of this Agreement: (a) the Company commits any felony under U.S.
federal law; (b) the Company prevides in connection with this Agreement deliberately false,
incomplete, or misleading information; (c) the Company fails to cooperate as set forth in this
Agreement; (d) the Company fails to implement a compliance program as set forth in this
Agreement and-Attachment C; (e) the Company commits any acts that, had they occurred within
the jurisdictional reach of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, would be a violation of the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act; or (f) the Company otherwise fails to perform or to fulfill completely any
of the Companyâs obligations under the Agreement, regardless of whether the Fraud Section
becomes aware of such a breach after the Term of the Agreement is complete, the Company, and
its subsidiaries and affiliates, shall thereafter be subject to prosecution for any federal criminal
violation of which the Fraud Section has knowledge, including, but not limited to, the conduct
described in the Statement of Facts, which may be pursued by the Fraud Section in the U.S.
District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky or any other venue of its choosing.
Determination of whether the Company has breached the Agreement and whether to pursue
prosecution of the Company shall be if the Fraud Sectionâs sole discretion: Any such prosecution
may be premised on information provided by the Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates, among
other things. Any such prosecution relating to the conduct described in the Statement of Facts or
relating to conduct known to the Fraud Section prior to the date on which this Agreement was
signed that is not time-barred by the applicable statute of limitations on the date of the signing of
this Agreement may be commenced against the Company, or its subsidiaries or affiliates,
notwithstanding the expiration of the statute of limitations, between the signing of this Agreement
and the expiration of the Term plus one year. Thus, by signing this Agreement, the Company
agrees that the statute of limitations with respect to any such prosecution that is not time-barred on
the date of the signing of this Agreement shall be tolled for the Term plus one year. In addition,
the Company agrees that the statute of limitations as to any violation of U.S. federal law that
occurs during the Term will be tolled from the date upon which the violation occurs until the
earlier of the date upon which the Fraud Section is made aware of the violation or the duration of

5

 
the Term plus five years, and that this period shall be excluded from any calculation of time for
purposes of the application of the statute of limitations.

In the event the Fraud Section determines that the Company has breached its Agreement,
the Fraud Section agtees to provide the Company with written notice of such breach prior to
instituting any prosecution resulting from such breach. Within thirty (30) days of receipt of such
notice, the Company shall have the opportunity to respond to the Fraud Section in writing to
explain the nature and circumstances of such breach, as well as the actions the Company have
taken to address and remediate the situation, which explanation the Fraud Section shall consider in
determining whether to pursue prosecution of the Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates.

In the event that the Fraud Section determines that the Company has breached this
Agreement: (a) all statements made by or on behalf of the Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates
to the Fraud Section or to the Court, including the Statement of Facts, and any testimony given by
the Company before a grand jury, a court, or any tribunal, or at any legislative hearings, whether
prior or subsequent to this Agreement, and any leads derived from such statements or testimony,
shall be admissible in evidence in any and all criminal proceedings brought by the Fraud Section
against the Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates; and (b) the Company or its subsidiaries or
affiliates shall not assert any claim under the United States Constitution, Rule 11(f) of the Federal
Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rule 410 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, or any other federal rule
that any such statements or testimony made by or on behalf of the Company or its subsidiaries or
affiliates prior or subsequent to this Agreement, or any leads derived therefrom, should be
suppressed or are otherwise inadmissible. The decision whether conduct or statements of any
current director; officer or. employee, or any person acting on behalf of, or at the direction of, the
Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates will be imputed to the Company for the purpose of
determining whether the Company has violated any provision of this Agreement shall be in the
sole discretion of the Fraud Section.

Except as may otherwise be agreed by the parties in connection with a particular
transaction, the Company agrees that in the event that, during the Term of the Agreement, it
undertakes any change in corporate form, including if it sells, merges, or transfers business
operations that are material to the Companyâs consolidated operations, or to the operations of any
subsidiaries or affiliates involved in the conduct described in the Statement of Facts, as they exist
as of the date of this Agreement, whether such sale is structured as a sale, asset sale, merger,
transfer, or other change in corporate form, it shall include in any contract for sale, merger, --
transfer, or other change in corporate form a provision binding the purchaser, or any successor in
interest thereto, to the obligations described in this Agreement: The purchaser or successor in
interest must also agree in writing that the Fraud Sectionâs ability to declare a breach under this
Agreement is applicable in full force to that entity. The Company agrees that the failure to
include these provisions in the transaction will make any such transaction null and void. The
Company shall provide notice to the Fraud Section at least thirty days prior to undertaking any
such sale, merger, transfer, or other change in corporate form. Ifthe Fraud Section notifies the
Company prior to such transaction (or series of transactions) that it has determined that the
transaction(s) has the effect of circumventing or frustrating the enforcement purposes of this
Agreement, as determined in the sole discretion of the Fraud Section, the Company agrees that
such transaction(s) will not be consummated. In addition, if at any time during the term of the
Agreement the Fraud Section determines in its sole discretion that the Company has engaged in a

6

 
transaction(s) that has the effect of circumventing or frustrating the enforcement purposes of this
Agreement, it may deem it a breach of this Agreement. Nothing herein shall restrict the Company
from indemnifying (or otherwise holding harmless) the purchaser or successor in interest for
penalties or other costs arising from any conduct that may have occurred prior to the date of the
transaction, so long as such indemnification does not have the effect of circumventing or
frustrating the enforcement purposes of this Agreement, as determined by the Fraud Section

This Agreement is binding on the Company and the Fraud Section but specifically does
not bind any other component of the Department of Justice, other federal agencies, or any state,
local, or foreign law enforcement or regulatory agencies, or any other authorities, although the
Fraud Section will bring the cooperation of the Company and its compliance with its other
obligations under this Agreement to the attention of such agencies and authorities if requested to
do so by the Company.

It is further understood that the Company and the Fraud Section may disclose this
Agreement to the public.

This Agreement sets forth all the terms of the agreement between the Company and the
Fraud Section. No amendments, modifications, or additions to this Agreement shall be valid
unless they are in writing and signed by the Fraud Section, the attorneys for the Company, and a
duly authorized representative of the Company.

STATEMENT OF FACTS

The following Statement of Facts is incorporated by reference as part of the Non-
Prosecution Agreement (the âAgreementâ) between the United States Department of Justice,
Criminal Division, Fraud Section (the âFraud Sectionâ) and the defendant General Cable
Corporation (âGeneral Cableâ or the âCompanyâ). General Cable hereby agrees and stipulates that
the following information is true and accurate. General Cable admits, accepts, and acknowledges
that it is responsible for the acts of its officers, directors, employees, and agents as set forth below.

Relevant General Cable Entities

1. General Cable, a Delaware corporation headquartered in Kentucky, manufactured,
distributed, and installed cable and wire globally. General Cable engaged in its business through
various subsidiaries around the world, and General Cable maintained separate geographic divisions
which oversaw operations of its subsidiaries in the carrying out of General Cableâs business.
General Cableâs shares were publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange and it was an
âGssuerâ within the meaning of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (ââFCPAâ), Title 15, United States
Code, Sections 78dd-1(a) and 78m(b).

2. General Cable Celcat, Energia e Telecomunicacoes, S.A. (âGeneral Cable Celcatâ)
was an indirect subsidiary of General Cable, headquartered in Portugal. General Cable Celcatâs
financial statements were consolidated into the financial statements of General Cable, and General
Cable Celcat was under the responsibility of the General Cable Europe and Mediterranean division.
General Cable Celcat sold cable and wire in Portugal and Angola.

3. General Cable Condel, Cabos de Enesgia e Telecomunicacoes SA (âGeneral Cable
Condelâ) was an indirect subsidiary of General Cable, headquartered in Angola. General Cable

Condelâs financial statements were consolidated into the financial statements of General Cable

A-l

 

 
through their consolidation into General Cable Celcatâs financial statements, and General Cable
Condel was under the responsibility of the General Cable Europe and Mediterranean division.
General Cable Condel sold cable and wire in Angola.

4, General Cable (Tianjin) Alloy Products Company Limited (âGeneral Cable Chinaâ)
was an indirect subsidiary of General Cable, headquartered in China. General Cable Chinaâs
financial statements were consolidated into the financial statements of General Cable, and General
Cable China was under the responsibility of the General Cable Asia Pacific division. General
Cable China sold cable and wire in China. General Cable China was acquired by General Cable on
or around December 2012.

5. Until its sale in August 2015, Phelps Dodge International (Thailand) Ltd. (âPDTLâ),
was an indirect subsidiary of General Cable, headquartered in Thailand. PDTLâs financial
statements were consolidated into the financial statements of General Cable, and PDTL was under
the responsibility of the General-Cable Asia Pacific division. PDTL sold cable and wire in
Bangladesh, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand. PDTL was acquired by General Cable on or
around October 31, 2007.

6. âFxecutive A,â an individual whose identity is known to the Fraud Section and to
General Cable, was an officer at PDTL from 2010 to 2012, and beginning in December 2012 was a
high-level executive at General Cable based in Thailand.

Overview of the Schemes

7. General Cable, acting through certain executives and employees, including
Executive A, knew that certain of its foreign subsidiaries used certain third-party agents and
distributors to make corrupt payments to foreign officials in order to obtain and retain business in

certain countries.

A-2

 
8. Nonetheless, General Cable knowingly and willfully failed to implement and
maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls designed to detect and prevent
corruption or otherwise illegal payments by its agents. In particular and as relevant here, General
Cable had deficient internal accounting controls that did not require and/or ensure, among other
things (a) due diligence for the retention of third party agents and distributors; (b) proof that
services had been rendered by third parties before payment could be made to them; (c) oversight of
the payment process to ensure that payments were made pursuant to contractual terms or that
payments were reasonable and legitimate. General Cable knowingly and willfully failed to address
these known weaknesses, in relevant part, to allow the conduct to continue.

9. As aresult, General Cable and its subsidiaries made more than $13 million in
payments to third-party agents and distributors which were used to make unlawful payments to
secure approximately $51 million in profits to General Cable.

Angola

10. General Cable conducted business in Angola through General Cable Celcat and
General Cable Condel. The majority of the companyâs sales in Angola were made to state-owned
customers, including Angolan State-Owned Enterprise 1, Angolan State-Owned Enterprise 2, and
Angolan State-Owned Enterprise 3.

11... Between 2003 and 2013, General Cable Celcat and General Cable Condel made
corrupt payments, i.e. bribes, to employees of Angolan State-Owned Enterprise 1, Angolan State-
Owned Enterprise 2, and Angolan State-Owned Enterprise 3, and other state-owned customers to
obtain and retain business in Angola. Specifically: (i) between 2003 and 2009, General Cable
Celcat and General Cable Condel paid more than $450,000 directly to officials at Angolan State-
Owned Enterprise 1, Angolan State-Owned Enterprise 2, and Angolan State-Owned Enterprise 3;

(ii) between 2009 and 2013, General Cable Condel paid more than $8.7 million to a sales agent in

A-3

 
Angola with knowledge that the sales agent would, and did, pass a portion of those payments to
officials at Angolan State-Owned Enterprise 1, Angolan State-Owned Enterprise 2, and Angolan
State-Owned Enterprise 3; and (iii) General Cable Condel paid more than $150,000 to another ~
agent with knowledge that the payments would be passed on, in part, to two officials of a state-
owned customer.

12. General Cable, General Cable Celcat and General Cable Condel, acting through
their employees or agents, communicated about the.scheme via e-mail, among other means of
communication. For example, on or about October 22, 2002, a General Cable Condel senior
executive wrote an e-mail to a General Cable Celcat employee stating: âI agreed with [an Angolan
State-Owned Enterprise | employee] on a commission of 2% on orders placed, which at this stage
will be through General Cable Condel; I propose to work through objectives, on an identical basis
with [Angolan State-Owned Enterprise 2].â

13. Similarly, on or about September 12; 2005, a General Cable Condel employee wrote
an e-mail to a General Cable Celcat employee stating: âEveryone knew that [an Angolan State-
Owned Enterprise 2 official] was being paid (if not there would be no need for the bills that come
from there); when the contract was signed, this was what was agreed had to be paid.â

14. Beginning in or around May 2009, General Cable Celcat and General Cable Condel
concealed the payments to the Angolan officials through the use ofa third-party sales agent.
General Cable Condel contracted with the sales agent to provide commercial assistance services in
Angola, but General Cable Celcat and General Cable Condel in fact used the sales agent as an
intermediary to funnel corrupt payments to Angolan officials.

15. On or about December 19, 2012, General Cable executives received an internal
audit report from General Cableâs internal audit department. The audit report summarized the

findings of the audit; which included, among other things, identifying that: (i) payments made to
A-4

 
the third-party sales agent far exceeded the amounts required under the contract with the agent, and
(ii) the contract with the third-party sales agent did not include anti-corruption language. In
addition, the audit report recommended that General Cable establish a global policy regarding the
use of agents and sales representatives. Thereafter, the Company failed to establish adequate
internal accounting controls and General Cable Condel continued to make corrupt payments to the
agent in excess of the contractually required amounts.

16. For example, on September 5, 2013, General Cable Condel paid the sales agent in
Angola approximately $223,433. General Cable Condel employees knew that the sales agent
would. give at least part of that payment to government officials in Angola, including an Angolan
State-Owned Enterprise 2 official and an Angolan State-Owned Enterprise 3 director.

17. General Cable Celcat and General Cable Condel falsely recorded the payments
made directly to the foreign officials as payments for third-party consulting services, and falsely
recorded the payments to the sales agent as offsets against sales.

Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Thailand

18. General Cable conducted business in Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Thailand through
PDTL. Between 2010 and 2014, PDTL made corrupt payments, i.e, bribes, to obtain business in
Bangladesh and Indonesia. Specifically, PDTL paid: (i) more than $2 million to two freight
forwarders.in Indonesia with the understanding.that the freight forwarders would use the money, in
part, for corrupt purposes; and (ii) $43,700 to an agent in Bangladesh with the understanding that
the agent would use the money, in part, for corrupt purposes. General Cable was aware of red
flags in connection with these payments and ultimately became aware of, or at the very least were
willfully blind to, certain of the corrupt payments.

19. General Cable and PDTL, acting through their employees and agents,

communicated about the scheme via e-mail, among other means of communication. For example,

A-5

 
on. or about March 11, 2010, a PDTL employee wrote an e-mail describing the services of a
principal of the two freight forwarders in Indonesia, stating â[LJike I mention it before, my agent
doesnât ask for any money upfront. He can afford to pay his way in and out of PLN [Perusahaan
Listrik Negara, the Indonesia-state-owned electricity company].â

-20. Similarly, on or about June 18, 2012, an employee of a Bangladeshi sales agent
emailed multiple PDTL employees, including Executive A, and stated that a portion of the money
that PDTL was paying the sales agent would âbe shared by decision makers in customer,
concerned higher ups in Ministry and some top executives at bidder.â

21. On or about May 5, 2013, Executive A approved an approximately $43,700
payment to the Bangladeshi sales agent.

22. In addition, from 2012 to 2013, PDTL provided more than $1.5 million in rebates to
a distributor in Thailand with the understanding that the distributor would use the money, in part,
for corrupt purposes in association with PDTLâs sales to.state-owned customers in Thailand,
including sales to: (i) the Provincial Electricity Authority, a state-owned electricity supplier in
Thailand; (ii) the Metropolitan Electricity Authority, a state-owned electricity supplier in Thailand;
and (iii) TOT Public Company Limited, a state-owned telecommunications company.

23. In or about 2011, Executive A met with a high-level executive at General Cable
with responsibility for overseeing international operations and expressed concerns that payments to
the distributor in Thailand were being used for corrupt purposes. Despite this conversation, the
corrupt payments did not stop, nor was an investigation conducted.

24. On December 13, 2011, the same high-level executive at General Cable received
emails that included the following statement regarding the findings ofa tax review in Thailand:
âpotential applicability of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPAâ) for commissions paid to

Thai governmental authorities.â Another email from a General Cable employee with responsibility

A-6

 
for corporate taxes stated: â[s]ince this is a legal matter rather than tax, no need to do anything
further for me. I will leave it up to you as to whether you want to look into any further.â General
Cable took no further action and did not take any steps to implement adequate internal accounting
controls. The corrupt payments made through intermediary companies in Thailand and elsewhere
continued and General Cable failed to enhance its deficient internal controls.

25. Thus, even if senior employees of General Cable were unaware initially that the
payments to the distributor were being used for illegal purposes, employees at PDTL and General
Cable, including Executive A, came to the understanding that money being paid to the distributor
was being used for illegal purposes, and closed their eyes to it being used for bribery.

26. Indeed, shortly after the meeting and email referenced in paragraphs 16 and 17
above, to conceal the true nature of the payments to the distributor, employees of PDTL ceased
booking the payments as âsuccess fees,â which they viewed as overly suspicious, and instead
established a rebate structure on unrelated sales to the distributor that falsely reflected the nature of
the payments. General Cable ultimately became aware that PDTL falsely recorded the payments to
the distributor in the companyâs books as âCash Discountsâ and âDiscount-Customer Rebates.â

China

27. General Cable conducted business in China through General Cable China, among

 

other entities..The-majority of the companyâs. sales in China were made to state-owned customers... -

through distributors or with the assistance of sales agents.

28. Between in or around December 2012 and 2015, General Cable China made corrupt
payments to obtain and retain business in China. Specifically, General Cable China paid more than
$500,000 to China-based agents and distributors, typically in the form of rebates, special discounts,
and technical service fees. General Cable China knew that the third-party agents and distributors

would use the money, in part, for corrupt purposes.

A-7
29. Executive A was the General Cable Executive that was responsible for General
Cable Chinaâs business beginning in or around December 2012 until his departure from the
Company.

30. General Cable China, acting through its employees and agents, communicated about
the scheme via e-mail, among other means of communication. For example, on or about August
14, 2013, a General Cable China employee sought approval from a General Cable China supervisor
to provide additional money to a distributor in the form of a discount in association with a sale to a
China-state-owned end-customer. The General Cable China employee emailed the supervisor and
justified the corrupt payment, stating that âa few key players at [the state-owned customer] are our
internal contacts and charge a certain amount of fees. If we are looking to have long-term
cooperation with them, charges for this is rather inevitable.â

31. Similarly, on or about February 26, 2014, a General Cable China internal document
outlined the reasons General Cable China provided special discounts to.a distributor in association
with sales to a state-owned end-customer, and stated: â[o]n July 17, 2013, processed the consulting

fee of 20,000 [yuan] for [a state-owned end-customer employee] with 10,900 [yuan] remaining.â

ATTACHMENT C
CORPORATE COMPLIANCE REPORTING
General Cable Corporation (the âCompanyâ) agrees that it will report to the Fraud
Section periodically, at no less than twelve-month intervals during a three-year term, regarding
remediation and implementation of the compliance program and internal controls, policies, and
procedures described in Attachment B. During this three-year period, the Company shall: (1)
conduct an initial review and submit an initial report, and (2) conduct and prepare at least two (2)
follow-up reviews and reports, as described below:

a. By no later than one year from the date this Agreement is executed, the
Company shall submit to the Fraud Section a written report setting forth a complete description
of its remediation efforts to date, its proposals reasonably designed to improve the Companyâs
internal controls, policies, and procedures for ensuring compliance with the FCPA and other
applicable anti-corruption laws, and the proposed scope of the subsequent reviews. The report
shall be transmitted to Deputy Chief - FCPA Unit, Fraud Section, Criminal Division, U.S.
Department of Justice, 1400 New York Avenue, NW, Bond Building, Eleventh Floor,
Washington, DC 20530. The Company may extend the time period for issuance of the report
with prior written approval of the Fraud Section.

b. The Company shall undertake at least two follow-up reviews and reports,
incorporating the Fraud Sectionâs views on the Companyâs prior reviews and reports, to further
monitor and assess whether the Companyâs policies and procedures are reasonably designed to
detect and prevent violations of the FCPA and other applicable anti-corruption laws.

objectives of the reporting requirement. For these reasons, among others, the reports and the
contents thereof are intended to remain and shall remain non-public, except as otherwise agreed
to by the parties in writing, or except to the extent that the Fraud Section determines in its sole
discretion that disclosure would be in furtherance of the Fraud Sectionâs discharge of its duties
and responsibilities or is otherwise required by law.

e. The Company may extend the time period for submission of any of the

follow-up reports with prior written approval of the Fraud Section.
