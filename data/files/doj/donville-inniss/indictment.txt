THE GRAND JURY CHARGES:

At all times relevant to this Indictment, unless otherwise stated:

 

I. The Defendant and Relevant Individuals and Entities

i The defendant DONVILLE INNISS, a United States lawful permanent
resident who resided in Tampa, Florida, and Barbados, was a member of the Parliament of
Barbados and the Minister of Industry, International Business, Commerce, and Small Business
Development of Barbados (collectively, âMinister of Industryâ). INNISS was a public official
in Barbados.

2, The âBarbados Company,â a corporation the identity of which is known to
the Grand Jury, was an insurance company headquartered in Barbados that offered various
financial products, including individual life, health and casualty insurance.

3 Barbados Company Executive 1, an individual whose identity is known to
the Grand Jury, was a citizen of Canada and a resident of Barbados. Barbados Company

Executive 1 was the Chief Executive Officer (âCEOâ) of the Barbados Company.
4. Barbados Company Executive 2, an individual whose identity is known to
the Grand Jury, was a citizen of Barbados and a resident of Barbados. Barbados Company
Executive 2 was a senior vice president of the Barbados Company.

3 Barbados Company Executive 3, an individual whose identity is known to
the Grand Jury, was a citizen of Barbados and a resident of Barbados. Barbados Company
Executive 3 was the Chief Financial Officer of the Barbados Company.

6. The âBermuda Company,â a corporation the identity of which is known to
the Grand Jury, was an insurance company headquartered in Bermuda that offered various
financial products, including life, property and casualty insurance. The Bermuda Company was
the majority shareholder of the Barbados Company.

7. The âNew York Dental Company,â a corporation the identity of which is
known to the Grand Jury, was a dental company that was incorporated in New York in 1992 and
had an address in Elmont, New York.

8. Co-Conspirator 1 (âCC-1â), an individual whose identity is known to the
Grand Jury, was a United States citizen and a resident of Tampa, Florida. CC-1 was the CEO of
the New York Dental Company and owned and controlled the company.

9. The Barbados Investment and Development Corporation (âBIDCââ) was an
agency of the government of Barbados. The defendant DONVILLE INNISS, as the Minister of
Industry, exercised authority over the BIDC.

Il. The Fraudulent Schemes

10. From in or about and between August 2015 and April 2016, the defendant

DONVILLE INNISS leveraged his positon as the Minister of Industry and engaged in a scheme

to accept approximately $36,000 in bribes from the Barbados Company, in violation of
Barbadian law, and to launder that money to and through the United States. Employees of the
Barbados Company, including Barbados Company Executives 1 and 2, agreed to pay bribes to
INNISS, who, in return, agreed to use his official position as the Minister of Industry to cause the
BIDC to renew insurance contracts with the Barbados Company.

11. In furtherance of the scheme, Barbados Company Executives 1, 2 and 3
caused the Barbados Companyâs majority shareholder, the Bermuda Company, to make bribe
payments to the defendant DONVILLE INNISS through a United States bank account in the
name of the New York Dental Company, which had no actual business with the Barbados
Company. The Barbados Company employees, including Barbados Company Executives 1, 2
and 3, did not disclose to the Bermuda Company that the payments were for the benefit of a
Barbadian government official and instead falsely claimed that the payments were for
âTclonsulting services.â

12. In furtherance of the scheme, in or about July 2015, the defendant
DONVILLE INNISS, using his official position as Minister of Industry, caused the BIDC to
renew an insurance contract with the Barbados Company (the â2015 Contractâ). By its terms,
the 2015 Contract required the BIDC to pay a premium of approximately $944,956.12 to the
Barbados Company and another insurance company.

13. In return, employees of the Barbados Company, including Barbados
Company Executives | and 2, agreed to pay a bribe of approximately $16,536.73 to the
defendant DONVILLE INNISS, in consideration for having caused the BIDC to renew the 2015
Contract. The bribe payment of approximately $16,536.73 was 1.75 percent of the premium
that the BIDC owed to the Barbados Company and another insurance company under the 2015

Contract.
14. | Toconceal the bribe payments, the defendant DONVILLE INNISS
arranged to launder the bribes through âBank 1,â a bank the identity of which is known to the
Grand Jury, with an address in Elmont, New York, in the name of the New York Dental
Company (the âNew York Dental Company Bank Accountâ). The payment was routed through
a branch of Bank 1 located in Brooklyn, New York. CC-1, a friend of INNISS, was the
authorized representative of the New York Dental Company Bank Account.

15. On or about August 17, 2015, the Bermuda Company transferred
approximately $16,536.73 to the New York Dental Company Bank Account based on a false
invoice provided by Barbados Company Executives 1, 2 and 3 for consulting services. On or
about August 19, 2015, the New York Dental Company transferred approximately $16,000 to a
Bank 1 account in the United States in the name of the defendant DONVILLE INNISS (the
âINNISS Bank Accountâ) via a check transaction. The New York Dental Company check for
approximately $16,000 was made payable to INNISS.

16. In or about March 2016, the defendant DONVILLE INNISS, using his
position as Minister of Industry, caused the BIDC to renew another insurance contract with the
Barbados Company (the â2016 Contractâ).

17. In return, employees of the Barbados Company, including Barbados
Company Executives | and 2, agreed to pay an additional bribe of approximately $20,000 to the
defendant DONVILLE INNISS, in consideration for having caused the BIDC to renew the 2016
Contract.

18. On or about April 18, 2016, the Bermuda Company transferred
approximately $20,000 to the New York Dental Company Bank Account based on a false

invoice provided by Barbados Company Executives 1, 2 and 3 for consulting services. On or
about April 25, 2016, the New York Dental Company made transfers of approximately $9,000
and $8,000 to the INNISS Bank Account via check transactions. The New York Dental
Company checks for approximately $9,000 and $8,000 were made payable to the defendant
DONVILLE INNISS. On or about April 27, 2016, the New York Dental Company transferred
approximately $2,750 to the INNISS Bank Account via a check transaction. The New York
Dental Company check for $2,750 was made payable to INNISS.

Ii. Barbados Prevention of Corruption Act

19. The Prevention of Corruption Act of Barbados (the âBarbados Prevention
of Corruption Actâ) provided in Section 3(1) that â[a]ny person who, by himself or by or in

exceeding seven nor less than three years.â
