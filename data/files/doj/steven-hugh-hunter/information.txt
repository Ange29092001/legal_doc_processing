Overview

12. From in or before 2003 through in or around 2009, Defendant
HUNTER was an executive at Company A, where he received training on the
FCPA. Defendant HUNTER knew that paying a bribe to a foreign official, in
order to secure an improper advantage in obtaining or retaining business, was
unlawful and could be a criminal violation of the FCPA.

13. In or around January 2009, Defendant HUNTER left his position at
Company A and joined Intermediary Company. Defendant HUNTERâs initial
position at Intermediary Company was Business Development Director, although
he also simultaneously worked at certain oil and gas systems integration companies
affiliated with Intermediary Company. In his position as Business Development
Director, Defendant HUNTER represented companies seeking to win oil, gas, and
construction projects in, among other places, Libya.

14. Inor around 2009, Defendant HUNTER learned that certain
principals and employees of Intermediary Company had conspired and agreed to
pay bribes to government officials of certain state-owned and state-controlled oil
and gas companies in numerous countries in order to secure an improper advantage

4
Case 4-18-cr-00415-1 *âSEALED* Document10_ Filed in TXSD on 07/23/2018 Page 5 of 16

in obtaining or retaining business for Intermediary Companyâs client companies,
including U.S. âissuers,â âdomestic concerns,â and âpersonsâ as those terms are
defined under the FCPA. Defendant HUNTER understood that Intermediary
Companyâs principals and employees who participated in the bribery scheme took
acts while in the territory of the United States and/or used U.S. wire transmissions
in furtherance of the corrupt scheme. In or around 2009, Defendant HUNTER
knowingly joined the conspiracy, and took acts in furtherance of the conspiracy to
bribe foreign officials in order to secure improper business advantages in obtaining
or retaining business for Intermediary Companyâs client companies, including,
among others, Company A, Company B, and Company C.

15. For example, on or before December 17, 2009, Co-Conspirator 1
instructed Defendant HUNTER to create a secret, personal email account to use
when transmitting confidential bidding and other information that employees of
Intermediary Company had obtained from state-owned and state-controlled oil and
gas companies. Defendant HUNTER understood at the time that there was a high
probability that Intermediary Company paid bribes in order to receive such
confidential bidding and other information. On or about December 17, 2009,
Defendant HUNTER created this email address as Co-Conspirator 1 directed.

16. Onor about May 11, 2009, Defendant HUNTER met with certain

âsub-agentsâ who offered services to assist Intermediary Companyâs clients to
Case 4-18-cr-00415-1 *SEALED* Document10_ Filed in TXSD on 07/23/2018 Page 6 of 16

obtain or retain business with Libyan state-owned and state-controlled oil and gas
companies. Defendant HUNTER knew that Intermediary Company sometimes
used sub-agents to make bribe payments. Intermediary Company had agreed to
collaborate with these particular sub-agents in connection with projects in Libya
and Tunisia, and had agreed to split with these sub-agents the commission fees that
Intermediary Company received from clients in connection with projects in Libya
and Tunisia. Thereafter, these sub-agents provided Defendant HUNTER and
others with confidential bidding information from within Libyan state-owned and
state-controlled oil companies. The sub-agents would hand-deliver this
confidential information, which was saved on flash drives, to Intermediary
Companyâs Libya offices.

17. Co-Conspirator 2, an Intermediary Company partner, served as the
main point of contact between Intermediary Company and Company B. Co-
Conspirator 2 knew that Intermediary Company made corrupt payments to obtain
and retain business for Intermediary Companyâs client companies, and Co-
Conspirator 2 openly discussed the need to pay people off in connection with deals
in Libya. One of Intermediary Companyâs principals told Defendant HUNTER to
exercise caution around Co-Conspirator 2, because Co-Conspirator 2 was reckless

in his discussion of corrupt payments, among other things.
Case 4-18-cr-00415-1 *SEALED* Document 10 Filed in TXSD on 07/23/2018 Page 7 of 16

18. Onor about April 30, 2010, Defendant HUNTER met with these sub-

agents, to discuss their assisting Intermediary Company, which at that time was

working as an agent of Company B to assist Company B in winning the contract

award for Libya Project A. At this meeting, the sub-agents indicated that they

were not interested in assisting Intermediary Company in pursuing Libya Project

A, but would assist with other projects. Thereafter, on or about May 1, 2010,

Defendant HUNTER emailed Co-Conspirator 1 and explained that Intermediary

Company might have to âtry to get the right guys on our side by ourselvesâ in

order to win Libya Project A for Company B. i
19. On or about and between May 2, 2010, and May 6, 2010, Defendant

HUNTER, and other employees of Intermediary Company traveled to Houston,

| Texas, to the Offshore Technology Conference in order to solicit business for

Intermediary Company in Libya and Iraq. While in Houston, Texas, Defendant

HUNTER participated in the solicitation of business from at least ten companies,

including SBM Offshore, N.V. and Company C.

20. Onor about June 13, 2010, Defendant HUNTER agreed to bribe

Libyan Official A in exchange for Libyan Official A providing confidential

| bidding information related to Libya Project A to Defendant HUNTER. On or
about July 21, 2010, Defendant HUNTER, using his secret, personal email

account, instructed two principals of Intermediary Company, including Co-
âCase 4-18-cr-00415-1 *SEALED* Document10_ Filed in TXSD on 07/23/2018 Page 8 of 16

Conspirator 1, to wire $4,000 as a bribe to a relative of Libyan Official A for the
benefit of Libyan Official A.

21. Onor about September 7, 2010, Libyan Official A emailed Defendant
HUNTER confidential bidding information to Defendant HUNTERâs secret,
personal email account related to Libya Project A. Defendant HUNTER then
transmitted this confidential information to Co-Conspirator 1 with instructions to
further pass the information to an agent of Company B.

22. Inor around June and July of 2011, principals of Intermediary
Company, including Co-Conspirator 1, learned that a foreign law enforcement
agency had begun investigating one of Intermediary Companyâs partners in
connection with a gas project in Kazakhstan. Intermediary Companyâs principals,
including Co-Conspirator 1, instructed Defendant HUNTER and others to turn in
their electronic hardware. Thereafter, Defendant HUNTER provided his computer
equipment to the principals of Intermediary Company.
