INTRODUCTION

At all times relevant to this Indictment:

Certain Relevant Persons and Entities

lL. Rolls-Royce Energy Systems, Inc. (âRRESYâ), was a United States company

headquartered in the Southern District of Ohio, and thus was a âdomestic concernâ within the

meaning of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (âFCPAâ), Title 15, United States Code,

Section 78dd-2. RRESI was an indirect subsidiary of Rolls-Royce plc (âRolls-Royceâ), a

publicly traded company in the United Kingdom, which was a holding company with major

business operations in the civil, aerospace, defense, marine, and energy sectors worldwide.

RRESI produced and supplied compressors and power turbines and provided aftermarket services

for oil and gas and power generation projects in a number of countries worldwide, including

Kazakhstan.

by Kazakhstan and performed government functions on behalf of Kazakhstan. China National
Petroleum Corporation was controlled by China and performed government functions on behalf of
China. In addition, AGP was controlled by the Kazakh and Chinese governments and performed
government functions for Kazakhstan and China. Thus, KazMunayGas, China National
Petroleum Corporation, and AGP were each an âinstrumentalityâ within the meaning of the FCPA.

3. âTechnical Advisor,â a company whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was
an international engineering and consulting firm with offices worldwide. Technical Advisor
purported to provide independent engineering advice and project management in a number of

Advisor.

11. âForeign Official 1,â an individual whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was
a high-ranking Kazakh official of KazMunayGas, which had authority over AGP, and thus was a
âforeign officialâ within the meaning of the FCPA. Foreign Official 1 had the authority to exert
official influence over purchasing decisions at AGP. CONTOGURIS and the co-conspirators
often referred to Foreign Official 1 as âFoxâ or âFuchs.â

12. âForeign Representative,â an individual whose identity is known to the Grand Jury,

Case: 2:17-cr-00233-EAS Doc #: 3 Filed: 10/12/17 Page: 4 of 25 PAGEID #: 6

representative for Foreign Official 1âs dealings with CONTOGURIS, Rolls-Royce, RRESI,
Technical Advisor, and the co-conspirators.

13. âForeign Official 2,â an individual whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was
a high-ranking Chinese official of Petrochina and its subsidiaries that had authority over AGP, and
thus was a âforeign officialâ within the meaning of the FCPA. Foreign Official 2 had the
authority to exert official influence over purchasing decisions at AGP.

General Allegations

14. _ Rolls-Royce, through its U.S. subsidiary RRESI, retained CONTOGURIS to pay
bribes to various individuals, including Foreign Official 1, in order to help Rolls-Royce and RRESI
secure and maintain contracts with AGP. After securing the contracts, RRESI paid
CONTOGURIS a percentage of the payments it received from AGP, which CONTOGURIS in
turn divided with Foreign Official 1 and other co-conspirators.

15. Specifically, in or around 2007, Kazakh and Chinese state-owned oil and gas
companies entered into the AGP joint venture agreement to construct a gas pipeline stretching
between Central Asia and China. Rolls-Royce, through RRESI, was among several companies
bidding for contracts in the construction of the pipeline beginning in or around 2008. Rolls-Royce
employees, including RR-1, RR-2, and RR-3, sought a commercial advisor with access to key
decision-makers in Kazakhstan in order to secure some of the contracts that AGP was going to put
out for tender. In particular, they had identified Foreign Official 1 as one of the key decision-
makers and were exploring ways to set up a meeting with Foreign Official 1. In or around the
same time, CONTOGURIS began working with TA-1, TA-2, and TA-3 to find a company willing
to pay them kickbacks in exchange for them helping that company win contracts with AGP,

including by paying bribes to Foreign Official 1 and others.
Case: 2:17-cr-00233-EAS Doc #: 3 Filed: 10/12/17 Page: 5 of 25 PAGEID #: 7

16. â Rolls-Royce and RRESI, through RR-1, RR-2, RR-3, and others, began working
toward an agreement with CONTOGURIS, TA-1, TA-2, and TA-3, and others, in or around late
2008 when AGP was awarding the first project, Compressor Station 4. RRESI had put in its bid
too late to influence the decision, however, and AGP awarded Compressor Station 4 to RRESIâs
main competitor (âthe Competitorâ) in or around March 2009. The sides still continued to work
on coming to an agreement whereby RRES] would pay CONTOGURIS a commission through
his company Gravitas, which CONTOGURIS, Foreign Official 1, TA-1, TA-2, TA-3, and others,
would split. AGP went on to award RRESI a contract for 11 of the 14 units comprising
Compressor Stations 1, 2, 6 and 7 in or around November 2009 for approximately $145 million.
AGP then made payments to RRESI starting in early 2010, and RRES]I in turn made commission
payments to Gravitas.s CONTOGURIS passed a portion of those commissions onto TA-1 and
TA-3, knowing that TA-1 and TA-3 were going to share that money with Foreign Official 1
consistent with the corrupt agreement.

17. Paragraphs 1 through 16 are re-alleged and incorporated by reference as though
fully set forth herein.

18. Beginning at least in or around 2008 and continuing through in or around 2012,
within the Southern District of Ohio and elsewhere, the defendant,

PETROS CONTOGURIS, a/k/a
PETROS CONTOGURIS-TROEMEL,

did knowingly and willfully, that is, with the intent to further the objects of the conspiracy,
combine, conspire, confederate, and agree with others known and unknown, including, among
others, RR-1, RR-2, and RR-3, to commit offenses against the United States, namely, to willfully

make use of the mails and means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce corruptly in

5
Case: 2:17-cr-00233-EAS Doc #: 3 Filed: 10/12/17 Page: 6 of 25 PAGEID #: 8

furtherance of an offer, payment, promise to pay, and authorization of the payment of any money,
offer, gift, promise to give, and authorization of the giving of anything of value, to a foreign official
and to any person, while knowing that all, or a portion of such money and things of value would
be and had been offered, given, and promised to a foreign official, for purposes of (i) influencing
acts and decisions of such foreign official in his or her official capacity; (ii) inducing such foreign
official to do and omit to do acts in violation of the lawful duty of such official; (iii) securing any
improper advantage; and (iv) inducing such foreign official to use his or her influence with a
foreign government and agencies and instrumentalities thereof, to affect and influence acts and
decisions of such government and agencies and instrumentalities, in order to assist RRESI in
obtaining and retaining business for and with, and directing business to, Rolls-Royce, RRESI,
CONTOGURIS, and others, in violation of Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2.
Objects of the Conspiracy
19. A principal purpose and object of the conspiracy was for CONTOGURIS and the
co-conspirators to enrich themselves by paying bribes to foreign officials in Kazakhstan in order
to obtain and retain business for Rolls-Royce, RRESI, and others, in connection with AGPâs gas
pipeline between Kazakhstan and China.
Manner and Means of the Conspiracy
20. The manner and means by which CONTOGURIS, together with his co-
conspirators and others known and unknown to the Grand Jury, sought to accomplish the object
of the conspiracy included, among other things, the following:
a. CONTOGURIS, RR-1, RR-2, RR-3, TA-1, TA-2, TA-3, and others, used
telephone calls, Short Message Service (âSMSâ) and text messages, and electronic

mail (âe-mailâ), among other means, to discuss bribe payments to foreign officials,
Case: 2:17-cr-00233-EAS Doc #: 3 Filed: 10/12/17 Page: 7 of 25 PAGEID #: 9

including Foreign Official 1, in connection with Rolls-Royce and RRESIâs efforts
to win business with AGP.

b. CONTOGURIS, RR-1, RR-2, RR-3, TA-1, TA-2, TA-3, and others, traveled to
and from the United States and several other countries to meet in person and arrange
for bribe payments to be made to foreign officials, including Foreign Official 1, in
order to assist Rolls-Royce and RRESI in winning business with AGP.

ce. CONTOGURIS, RR-1, RR-2, RR-3, TA-1, TA-2, TA-3, and others, arranged
meetings with Foreign Official 1 and Foreign Official 2 in order to solidify their
influence in support of Rolls-Royce and RRESIâs attempts to obtain and retain
business from AGP.

d. CONTOGURIS, RR-1, RR-2, RR-3, TA-1, TA-2, TA-3, and others, caused Rolls-
Royce and RRESI to enter into an advisor agreement with Gravitas, through which

bound for foreign officials, including Foreign Official 1.

e. CONTOGURIS, RR-1, RR-2, RR-3, TA-1, TA-2, TA-3, and others, took various
surreptitious steps to promote and conceal the bribery scheme, including by (i)
using code names, such as âFoxâ and âFuchs,â to refer to Foreign Official 1, and
(ii) concealing the bribe payments to Foreign Official 1 within RRESIâs
commission payments to Gravitas.

f. CONTOGURIS, RR-1, RR-2, RR-3, TA-1, TA-2, TA-3, and others, transferred
and caused to be transferred funds, including bribe payments, to and from bank
accounts in the United States, Kazakhstan, the United Kingdom, the Bahamas,
Singapore, Hong Kong, Switzerland, and elsewhere, to promote and conceal the

bribery scheme.
Case: 2:17-cr-00233-EAS Doc #: 3 Filed: 10/12/17 Page: 8 of 25 PAGEID #: 10

g. CONTOGURIS, RR-1, RR-2, RR-3, TA-1, TA-2, TA-3, and others, discussed and
disseminated confidential and internal AGP and Technical Advisor documents and
information to help Rolls-Royce and RRESI win business with AGP.

h. CONTOGURIS, RR-1, RR-2, RR-3, TA-1, TA-2, TA-3, and others, used invoices
in an attempt to provide the appearance of legitimacy to the commission payments
and fund transfers.

Overt Acts

21. In furtherance of the conspiracy and to achieve the objects thereof, at least one of
the co-conspirators committed, or caused to be committed, in the Southern District of Ohio and
elsewhere, at least one of the following overt acts, among others:

22. On or about September 25, 2008, CONTOGURIS, Foreign Representative, and
RR-1 met in Moscow, Russia to discuss the ways in which CONTOGURIS and Foreign
Representative could assist Rolls-Royce in winning business from AGP.

23. On or about September 27, 2008, RRESI submitted a bid to AGP for Compressor
Station 4.

24. On or about October 30, 2008, CONTOGURIS and RR-3 flew to Kazakhstan,
where they met with Foreign Official.1 and Foreign Representative.

25. On or about November 27, 2008, RR-3 met with Foreign Official 2 and TA-3 in
China and discussed potential business opportunities for Rolls-Royce with AGP, including
supplying the gas turbine compressor packages for Compressor Station 4.

26. On or about December 3, 2008, CONTOGURIS flew to London, England, where
he met with RR-3, TA-2, Foreign Representative and Foreign Official 1.

27. On or about December 4, 2008, CONTOGURIS e-mailed RR-3, copying TA-2,

and recounting the December 3, 2008 meeting, stating:
8
Case: 2:17-cr-00233-EAS Doc #: 3 Filed: 10/12/17 Page: 9 of 25 PAGEID #: 11

[TA-2] and I sincerely hope that all of your concerns were laid to rest during the meeting
with Mr. Fox. He has clearly taken a position and confirmed that [Foreign

Representative] is designated as a welcome and reliable local partner. . . . You also saw
how respectful [Foreign Representative] behaved vis-a-vis Mr. Fox. Everything is
marching in the right direction.

Mr. Fox authorized [TA-2] to let you benefit from receiving information when and if it is
being produced in order to give you more time to prepare. This is also an indication that
he wanted you to know that he is the âMaster of the gameâ.

28. On or about December 12, 2008, CONTOGURIS e-mailed RR-1 and RR-3 a copy
of an intemal AGP evaluation of the Competitorâs bid for Compressor Station 4.
CONTOGURIS wrote: âJob has not been awarded. Best tactic to follow is to let me know what
we offer in terms of short and medium/long term remuneration scheme. Will process this through
[Foreign Representative] and hope to turn it around. [TA-3] says Chinese have no objection.
Please do not make available to anyone else but addresses.â

29. On or about December 27, 2008, RR-3 e-mailed CONTOGURIS a proposed
engagement letter between Rolls-Royce and Gravitas for the AGP project that provided. for
Gravitas to be paid a 2% commission on new equipment for the compressor stations on the pipeline
and a 6% commission for aftermarket sales.

30. On or about December 27, 2008, CONTOGURIS replied to RR-3âs e-mail:
â[TA-1] told me yesterday that [Foreign Representative] would like to meet in Zurich ... . and take
it to the next level.â

31. On or about December 27, 2008, CONTOGURIS forwarded to TA-1 and TA-2
the Rolls-Royce engagement letter from RR-3 and added a recap of where things stood, writing:
âWe met with Mr. Fox and [Foreign Representative] on June 28th . . . and agreed on the basic
principle of cooperation. On the 29th of August we had the unsuccessful meeting with [the
Competitor] and commenced the canvassing of RR.â In the e-mail, CONTOGURIS also listed

the meetings with RR-1, RR-2, and RR-3 over the previous few months, as well as âdozens of e-

9
Case: 2:17-cr-00233-EAS Doc #: 3 Filed: 10/12/17 Page: 10 of 25 PAGEID #: 12

mail exchanges and telephone calls,â before noting: âWe are four partners, TA-3, TA-1, TA-2
and the undersigned.â

32. On or about January 11, 2009, CONTOGURIS e-mailed TA-i and TA-2, and
addressing TA-1, wrote:

It may be stated without any doubt that without the joint efforts of [TA-2], [TA-1] and the

undersigned (augmented by the valiant efforts of our friend and partner in Peking, [TA-3])

the Kazakh Group led by [Foreign Representative] would not have been able to proceed to
the status quo we have managed to be elevated to. .. . The âsecretâ weapon without much
doubt, is the responsible role that the [Technical Advisor] is requested to assist [AGP] with
the adjudication process. . . . I will do my best to bring [RR-1] and [RR-2] to the state-of-
mind that will predicate our presence. . . . [Y]our contribution is to keep Fox in-line with

the decision making process, however [TA-2] needs to head our efforts to negotiate a

workable and therefore profitable deal for us.

33. On or about January 15, 2009, RR-1, RR-2, TA-2 and CONTOGURIS met with
Foreign Representative and his Swiss lawyers in Zurich, Switzerland. At the meeting, Foreign
Representative explained that Rolls-Royceâs proposed bribe of 2% of the price for new equipment
sales that Rolls-Royce received was not acceptable. Foreign Representative instead demanded a
bribe of 10% of the new equipment sales and threatened that Rolls-Royce would not win any
business if it did not agree.

34. On or about January 19, 2009, TA-1 e-mailed TA-2 to update him on the Zurich
meeting and wrote: âThe main purpose was to find a deal for the future RR activity in Kz and
upcoming tender for CS 4.... RR informed they have no objection to a deal, but they need a
clear source and company to deal via.â

35. On or about January 20, 2009, RR-1 e-mailed RR-2 and RR-3 to report that he had
a phone call with TA-2 and CONTOGURIS, and â[TA-1] is to meet mr fox either tomorrow or
friday. He needs input on how far rr is willing to go. As discussed with [RR-2] last week this

need[s] to come from reallicating [sic] the percentages. After that [RR-3] [w]ill need to meet mr

fox to confirm this number on very short notice.â
10
Case: 2:17-cr-00233-EAS Doc #: 3 Filed: 10/12/17 Page: 11 of 25 PAGEID #: 13

36. On or about January 26, 2009, CONTOGURIS sent an e-mail to RR-1, RR-2, and
RR-3, and wrote that in his âpersistent effort to render every kind of conceivable effort and
endeavor to assist RR energy to be awarded the CS 4 and/or other contracts,â he was attaching
internal AGP documents, which he summarized as demonstrating the Chinese side of AGPâs
preferences for certain turbine specifications that could favor the Competitor.

37. On or about January 26, 2009, RR-1 replied to CONTOGURISâs e-mail: âAs
discussed earlier today we need all the support to tum Kazakhstan into our favor. Please ask
you[r] friend [TA-3] to work from his angle. . . . I look forward to discuss [sic] our proposal . . .
on the alternative solution to CS4.â

38. On or about January 26, 2009, TA-2 e-mailed TA-3: âDear [TA-3], please do
your utmost that [the Chinese partner at AGP] will consider RRâs proposal and start negotiations
with them soonest. Copy of the RR bid will be submitted to you immediately.â

39, On or about February 6, 2009, CONTOGURIS met with RR-1 and RR-2 in
London, where they informed CONTOGURIS that based on the prior mecting in Zurich they
would not move forward with CONTOGURIS as an advisor on the AGP bids if Foreign
Representative continued to be involved.

40. On or about February 24, 2009, CONTOGURIS and TA-2 had a conference call
with RR-1 and RR-2, in which they agreed that Rolls-Royce would continue to work with
CONTOGURIS on RRESIâs AGP bids without Foreign Representative.

41. Onor about February 28, 2009, CONTOGURIS e-mailed TA-1 and TA-2, writing
that âthe offensive behavior of [Foreign Representative] has led RR to not want to collaborate with
him.â CONTOGURIS then proposed a way forward:

Ihave suggested you [TA-1] be the official RR man on the ground in Kazakahstan [sic], in
whatever function. ... GM or Chief Advisor Kazakhstan or whatever. . . . You secure the

ll
Case: 2:17-cr-00233-EAS Doc #: 3 Filed: 10/12/17 Page: 12 of 25 PAGEID #: 14

collaboration of your friend [Foreign Official 1]. Iam going to install [sic] an absolutely
satisfactory system how future revenues are going to be distributed.

CONTOGURIS, switching to the third person, then wrote: âWe shall distribute 60% to your
friend and 10% each to our partner in China [TA-3], our partner in Kazakhstan [TA-1], our partner
in Austria [TA-2] and our partner in Turkey [CONTOGURIS].â CONTOGURIS also
proposed paying Foreign Official 1 his split of the Gravitas commission from Rolls-Royce through
TA-1 via a Singaporean shell company.

42. On or about March 5, 2009, TA-1 responded to CONTOGURIS: âI [met] Mr.
Fox and we also discussed RR issue. He agreed and has nothing against that I will be in charge
for dealing with RR. The scheme as in your e-mail might be implemented.â

43. On or about March 20, 2009, AGP awarded the contract for Compressor Station 4
to the Competitor.

44. On or about May, 8, 2009, RRESI submitted its bid to supply AGP with 14 gas
turbine compressor packages for Compressor Stations 1, 2, 6, and 7.

45. On or about May 8, 2009, after RR-1, RR-2, RR-3, and others at RRESI realized
that its margins were going to be much lower than it had first anticipated, RR-3 e-mailed
CONTOGURIS a new commission agreement which provided for a Gravitas commission reduced
from 2% to 1.5% on new equipment for the compressor stations on the pipeline and reduced from
6% to 3% for aftermarket sales.

46. On or about May 9, 2009, CONTOGURIS forwarded RR-3âs e-mail to TA-1 and
wrote: âRR have told me that this is the absolute maximum they can afford in their calculation,
whilst still remaining competitive. [TA-1] please be so kind and speak to your people and obtain

their concurrence that this agreement should be countersigned and entered into.â

12
Case: 2:17-cr-00233-EAS Doc #: 3 Filed: 10/12/17 Page: 13 of 25 PAGEID #: 15

47. On or about May 12, 2009, TA-1 replied to the e-mail from CONTOGURIS
referenced in Paragraph 46 above, stating: âJ should have a private meeting with Mr. Fox in
several days. ... Meanwhile could you please advise â if I indicate 1,5% and then 3% and it [g]oes
all to Fox&company where is our interest to be ingaged [sic] in the process?â

48. On or about May 12, 2009, CONTOGURIS responded to the e-mail from TA-1
referenced in Paragraph 47 above, stating: âBottom line is that I do not know how to answer your
question. We have what we have and Fox has to at least share 2/3 1/3, we definitely do not want
the business otherwise. . . .[I]f Fox is not agreeable to support the RR fully as and [sic] what we
have on the table today, I will cancel the arrangement and tell them to go ahead without our

support.â

49. On or about June 6, 2009, TA-1 e-mailed CONTOGURIS after TA-1 met with

âFox,â and wrote:

Summary: R is very competitive from all points of view (technical and price). To

negotiate the relations with R, at this point he indicated that 1,5 and 3 is not acceptable and

proposed 3,5 and 3,5. But I clearly understood it is negotiable (I mean it should be a room

for us, otherwise bringing the Client and working with him for a year for free itâs a

nonsense). . . . I believe at least 0,5 should be reserved for us... .

50. Onorabout June 12, 2009, CONTOGURIS sent an e-mail to TA-1 with the subject
line âour friends in London,â explaining that CONTOGURIS tried to push Rolls-Royce to
increase the Gravitas commission but it would not go further and was âprepared to walk away
from the transaction completely.â CONTOGURIS noted: âThe corporate governance
processes of this listed company is formidable, there are forty employees in a division that is
specifically designed to avoid exactly this what your friend wants to do now.â

51. On or about June 18, 2009, TA-1 responded to the e-mail from CONTOGURIS

referenced in Paragraph 50 above, stating that âMr. Fox [wa]s getting angry,â that the âproposed

13
Case: 2:17-cr-00233-EAS Doc #: 3 Filed: 10/12/17 Page: 14 of 25 PAGEID #: 16

3,5 [wa]s already the lowest ever on the market,â and that â[t]he arguments â âlisted companyâ or
âcorporate governance processâ they can leave for mass mediaâ because other âeven bigger
caliberâ companies were always able to find a âcompromise.â

52. On or about June 21, 2009, CONTOGURIS e-mailed TA-1 and TA-2 and stated:
âTell Mr. Fuchs to proceed as is and we will cede 75% of the current agreement to your Singapore
company. That means that you will receive 1.833.750,-USD at this stage and we will be satisfied
with 611.000,-USD. ... As it is there are 6.7 Million lying on the table for Fuchs and 1.8 Million
for us from phases 1 +2.â CONTOGURIS added: âThis is a listed company operating in a
country where anti-corruption laws are the strictest in Europe. Ifit had not been for my 8 Billion
USD track record and my business acumen shown, at least [TA-2] knows that, there would not be
a deal on the table.â

53. On or about August 3, 2009, RR-2 and RR-3 traveled to Astana, Kazakhstan and
met with TA-1, where they discussed RRESIâs bid and prepared for AGPâs upcoming bid
clarification meetings.

34. On or about August 4, 2009, CONTOGURIS sent an e-mail to RR-3, copying TA-
2, in which CONTOGURIS advised that he had learned that RRESTâs bid had a potential technical
deficiency in the proposed emissions efficiency and that one way to address it involved going
âthrough [TA-3]âs Chinese support structureâ where TA-3 had âunimaginable waysâ of âreachingâ
into the Chinese government.

55. On or about August 10, 2009, TA-1 e-mailed RR-3: âI have discussed with Fox
the issue. Diplomatically he answered support will be provided, but now also a lot depends on
your technical clarification.â

Case: 2:17-cr-00233-EAS Doc #: 3 Filed: 10/12/17 Page: 15 of 25 PAGEID #: 17

would pay to Gravitas for new equipment by .75% (for a total of 2.25%) if RRESI won all 14
turbines that were up for bid (for Compressor Stations 1, 2, 6 and 7), and .25% (for a total of
1.75%) if it won fewer than all 14.

57. On or about August 14, 2009, TA-3 e-mailed CONTOGURIS and relayed that he
had learned that âChinese preferable option is: CS No-1 for [the Competitor] (from supply
schedule reason and âif Kazakh side can keep a faceâ). Other 3 station for RR... .â

58. On or about August 14, 2009, CONTOGURIS e-mailed TA-1 and TA-2,
summarizing the split between Foreign Official 1 and TA-1, TA-2, TA-3, and CONTOGURIS:
âThat means the final picture is the following: In case all 14 machines are awarded the Foxtrott
Co will receive 1.50%, the balance will go to the âQuatrumphirateâ. In case less than 14 machines,
the 1.25% will go to Foxtrott Co and the balance will go to âQuatrumphirate.â.â

59. On or about August 15, 2009, TA-1 replied to the e-mail from CONTOGURIS
referenced in Paragraph 58 above, stating: âI made my best recently to sort out at least our
position towards [RR-3] and lialize [sic] with Fox.â TA-1 explained that â[w]hat [wa]s more
difficult was to influence [sic] [Technical Advisorâs] engineers!â

60. On or about August 28, 2009, after individuals within the Kazakh side of AGP
circulated an internal memorandum deeming RRESIâs bid âtechnically unacceptableâ and
recommending disqualification, TA-2 attached the memorandum to an e-mail to TA-3, and copied
CONTOGURIS. TA-2 noted that, âthe Kazakhs have used the weak points of RR and calculated
very high financial losses,â and asked TA-3, âHow is the situation now?â

61. On or about August 28, 2009, CONTOGURIS forwarded to RR-3 the e-mail
referenced in Paragraph 60 above and wrote that TA-3 was âreporting from Pekingâ that a Chinese
foreign official told him that nothing was decided yet and that they were âtrying [their] best to

increase the leverage from Chinese side, to stop the bloody Kazak [sic].â

62. Onor about August 30, 2009, TA-1 met with Foreign Official 1 to discuss AGPâs

saying âthe deal with fox is cancelled.â

64. . On or about September 7, 2009, TA-1 e-mailed RR-3, copied RR-2 and
CONTOGURIS, and explained that Foreign Official 1 had âinitiated an internal investigationâ
into the memorandum disqualifying RRESI while Technical Advisor had refused to endorse it.
TA-1 explained that â[bJecause of Fox and our company position (plus to certain extend [sic]
Chinese position) [the disqualification] decision is blocked.â Referring to RR-3âs SMS, TA-1
then wrote âTâm stick [sic] to . . . agreements reached, unless they are cancelled. I feel regret now
to be involved in all this discussions (which, as gentlemen, we should keep absolutely in high
confidentiality). Also my reputation (in front of Fox, for example) can be harmed.... Ikindly
ask you asap to confirm/or not your sms.â

65. On or about September 11, 2009, CONTOGURIS e-mailed RR-2 and RR-3,
attaching a confidential written report from Technical Advisor setting out arguments for why the
internal memorandum disqualifying RRESI was incorrect and proclaiming that RRESIâs bid was
acceptable. In the e-mail, CONTOGURIS wrote: âI sincerely hope that your previously
mentioned grievances have been put to rest. . .. 1 am sure you can âuseâ this adequately. If you
cannot provide access of this document to your Chinese friends, please let me know and I will
inform [TA-3] to hand it over officially.â
