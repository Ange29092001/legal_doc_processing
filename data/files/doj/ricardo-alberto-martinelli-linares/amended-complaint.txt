Ill. The Criminal Scheme

 

A. Overview of the Odebrecht Bribery Scheme

 

23. On December 21, 2016, Odebrecht S.A. pleaded guilty in the Eastern
District of New York to a one-count criminal information charging it with conspiracy to violate
the anti-bribery provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, in violation of 18 U.S.C. Â§ 371
and 15 U.S.C. Â§ 78dd-3. See ECF Docket No. 16-CR- 643. As part of its plea agreement,
Odebrecht S.A. admitted that, in or about and between 2001 and 2016, Odebrecht, through
certain of its employees and agents, and together with other co-conspirators, engaged in a
massive bribery scheme in which the co-conspirators agreed with others to corruptly pay over
$700 million in bribes to, and for the benefit of, public servants, foreign officials, foreign
political parties, foreign political party officials and foreign political candidates to obtain and
retain business and to gain an advantage and benefit from the public servants and foreign

officials in various countries around the world, including public officials and public servants in
Case 1:20-mj-00498-RML Document5 Filed 07/20/20 Page 8 of 12 PagelD #: 24

Panama. Odebrechtâs bribery scheme included corrupt payments and the provision of other
things of value.

24. Odebrecht concealed the nature, source, ownership and control of the
proceeds of the bribery scheme by funneling the proceeds of the scheme through offshore shell
company bank accounts to the ultimate beneficiaries of the bribes, namely, public servants,
foreign officials, foreign political parties, foreign political candidates and their representatives.

25. Odebrecht, together with certain of its employees and agents, caused wire
transfers to be made from Odebrecht-related bank accounts to offshore shell company bank
accounts controlled by Odebrecht, including through New York-based accounts, such as those at
Banks 6, 7 and 8. Funds intended for the illegal bribe payments were then transferred through
multiple offshore shell company bank accounts throughout the world, including through New
York-based accounts, before reaching the final bribe recipients.

26. Odebrecht used an agent in the United States to purchase offshore shell
companies for Odebrecht, to send and receive documents to facilitate the establishment of
offshore bank accounts in the name of offshore shell companies for Odebrecht and to send and
receive documents, certain of which contained false and fraudulent information, to cause
financial transactions to be conducted from offshore shell company bank accounts, including
financial transactions that utilized U.S. correspondent bank accounts.

B. Overview of the Defendantsâ Role in the Odebrecht Bribery Scheme

 

27. In or about and between August 2009 and July 2014, the defendants LUIS
ENRIQUE MARTINELLI LINARES and RICARDO ALBERTO MARTINELLI LINARES,

together with others, participated in the Odebrecht bribery scheme by, among other things,
serving as intermediaries for corrupt payments and the provision of other things of value that
Odebrecht offered and provided to the Panama Government Official. Among other things, LUIS
MARTINELLI and RICARDO MARTINELLI LINARES established offshore bank accounts in
the names of offshore shell companies to receive and disguise bribe payments from Odebrecht
made for the benefit of the Panama Government Official.

28. From approximately August 2009 to September 2015, the defendants
LUIS ENRIQUE MARTINELLI LINARES and RICARDO ALBERTO MARTINELLI
LINARES, together with others, took a number of steps to open and manage secret bank
accounts held in the names of shell companies in foreign jurisdictions, which were used to
receive, further transfer and deliver bribe payments that Odebrecht made and caused to be made
for the benefit of the Panama Government Official. Specifically, LUIS MARTINELLI and
RICARDO MARTINELLI LINARES established shell companies in foreign jurisdictions;
served as the signatories on certain of the shell company bank accounts; and personally sent and
caused to be sent wire transfers through the structure of shell company bank accounts to conceal
and spend bribery proceeds.

29. In or about and between 2009 and 2012, the defendants LUIS ENRIQUE
MARTINELLI LINARES and RICARDO ALBERTO MARTINELLI LINARES opened bank
accounts in Switzerland for the purpose of receiving, further transferring and delivering bribe
payments from Odebrecht for the benefit of the Panama Government Official in the name of
Offshore Company A at Bank 1, Offshore Company B and Offshore Company I at Bank 2,

Offshore Company C at Bank 3, Offshore Company D at Bank 4, and Offshore Company E,
Offshore Company F, Offshore Company G and Offshore Company H, all at Bank 5 (together
the âOffshore Company Accountsâ).

30. The purpose of opening and operating the Offshore Company Accounts
was to promote, assist, facilitate, conceal and serve as intermediaries for Odebrechtâs payment of
bribes for the benefit of the Panama Government Official so that Odebrecht could obtain an
improper business advantage and gain and retain business in Panama by causing the Panama
Government Official to perform acts proper to his/her position in his/her official capacity and in
violation of his/her obligations.

31. â In total, in or about and between 2009 and 2012, the Offshore Company
Accounts received approximately $28 million in bribe proceeds from Odebrecht for the benefit
of the Panama Government Official. At least approximately $19 million of those bribe proceeds
were transferred through U.S. correspondent bank accounts, including Bank 6 and Bank 7 in
New York, New York, into the Offshore Company Accounts.

32. For example, financial records show that on or about July 27, 2010, a wire
transfer of approximately $350,000.00 U.S. dollars were transferred from an offshore shell
company bank account controlled by Odebrecht and located in Portugal to the Offshore
Company A account at Bank 1, through an account at Bank 6 in New York, New York.

33. The defendants LUIS ENRIQUE MARTINELLI LINARES and
RICARDO ALBERTO MARTINELLI LINARES later conducted numerous additional financial
transactions through U.S. banks, some of which were located in New York, New York, involving

the proceeds of bribe payments from Odebrecht.

10
34. Financial records show that on or about February 11, 2013, the defendant
LUIS ENRIQUE MARTINELLI LINARES caused the transfer of approximately $346,500.00
U.S. dollars from the Offshore Company I account at Bank 2, through an account at Bank 6 in
New York, New York, to an account in New Jersey at Bank 9. Records obtained from a yacht
broker in New York show that this transfer was a partial payment for the purchase of a yacht.

35. Financial records show that on or about November 12, 2013, the
defendants LUIS ENRIQUE MARTINELLI LINARES and RICARDO ALBERTO
MARTINELLI LINARES caused the transfer of approximately $899,978.32 U.S. dollars from
the Offshore Company A account at Bank 1 to the Offshore Company E account at Bank 5,
through accounts at Bank 8 in New York, New York.

36. Financial records show that on or about December 10, 2013, the
defendants LUIS ENRIQUE MARTINELLI LINARES and RICARDO ALBERTO
MARTINELLI LINARES caused the transfer of approximately $30,887.21 U.S. dollars from the
Offshore Company A account at Bank | to the Offshore Company E account at Bank 5, through
accounts at Bank 8 in New York, New York.

37. Financial records show that on or about August 26, 2015, the defendant
LUIS ENRIQUE MARTINELLI LINARES caused the transfer of approximately $570,000.00
U.S. dollars from the Offshore Company I account at Bank 2 through an account at Bank 6 in
New York, New York, to an account at Bank 6 in Florida. Title transaction records show that
this transfer was a partial payment for the purchase of a condominium in Miami by a Florida

corporation on behalf of LUIS MARTINELLI.
