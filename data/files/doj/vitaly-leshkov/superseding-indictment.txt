THE GRAND JURY CHARGES:
INTRODUCTION

At all times relevant to this Indictment:
Certain Relevant Persons and Entities

1. Rolls-Royce Energy Systems, Inc. (âRRESIâ), was a United States company
headquartered in the Southern District of Ohio, and thus was a âdomestic concernâ within the
meaning of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (âFCPAâ), Title 15, United States Code,
Section 78dd-2. RRESI was an indirect subsidiary of Rolls-Royce plc (âRolls-Royceâ), a
publicly traded company in the United Kingdom, which was a holding company with major
business operations in the civil, aerospace, defense, marine, and energy sectors worldwide.
RRESI produced and supplied compressors and power turbines and provided aftermarket services
for oil and gas and power generation projects in a number of countries worldwide, including

Kazakhstan.
2. Asia Gas Pipeline, LLP (âAGPâ) was a state-owned joint venture between
Kazakhstanâs KazMunayGas and Chinaâs National Petroleum Corporation that was created to
build and connect a gas pipeline between Kazakhstan and China. KazMunayGas was controlled
by Kazakhstan and performed government functions on behalf of Kazakhstan. China National
Petroleum Corporation was controlled by China and performed government functions on behalf of
China. In addition, AGP was controlled by the Kazakh and Chinese governments and performed
government functions for Kazakhstan and China. Thus, KazMunayGas, China National
Petroleum Corporation, and AGP were each an âinstrumentalityâ within the meaning of the FCPA.

3. âTechnical Advisor,â a company whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was
an international engineering and consulting firm with offices worldwide. Technical Advisor
purported to provide independent engineering advice and project management in a number of
business sectors, such as national infrastructure, oil and gas, and energy. Technical Advisor was
retained by AGP to assist it in designing bid specifications and evaluating and awarding bids. In
that capacity, Technical Advisor and its employees assigned to work on AGP projects were acting
in âan official capacity for and on behalf ofâ AGP and its joint venture owners within the meaning
of the FCPA.

4. Defendant PETROS CONTOGURIS, a/k/a PETROS CONTOGURIS-
TROEMEL (âCONTOGURISâ), a Greek national and resident of Istanbul, Turkey, was the
founder and Chief Executive Officer of Gravitas & CIE International Ltd. (âGravitasâ), a Turkey-
based commercial agent and advisor for various oil and gas projects throughout the world.
CONTOGURIS was a commercial agent for RRESI on the Asia Gas Pipeline project in
Kazakhstan. CONTOGURIS was an âagentâ of a domestic concern within the meaning of the

FCPA.
5. Defendant VITALY LESHKOV (âLESHKOVââ) was a Russian national and
employee of the Almaty, Kazakhstan office of Technical Advisor. As an employee of Technical
Advisor assigned to work on the AGP projects, LESHKOV had the ability to exert influence over
decisions at AGP, and he acted in âan official capacity for and on behalf ofâ AGP and its joint
venture owners within the meaning of the FCPA.

6. Defendant AZAT MARTIROSSIAN, a/k/a AZAT MARTIROSYAN
(âMARTIROSSIANâ), was an Armenian national and employee of the Beijing, China office of
Technical Advisor. Before working with Technical Advisor, MARTIROSSIAN formerly was
Armeniaâs ambassador to China. As an employee of Technical Advisor assigned to work on the
AGP projects, MARTIROSSIAN had the ability to exert influence over decisions at AGP, and he
acted in âan official capacity for and on behalf ofâ AGP and its joint venture owners within the
meaning of the FCPA.

7. Louis Zuurhout (âZuurhoutâ) was a Dutch national and an employee of Dutch
subsidiaries of Rolls-Royce with responsibility for selling equipment manufactured or assembled
by RRESI.

8. Keith Barnett (âBarnettâ) was a U.S. national and employee of Rolls-Royce with
responsibility as a sales director for the sales of equipment manufactured and assembled by RRESI.

9. James Finley (âFinleyâ) was a U.K. national and an executive of Rolls-Royce with
responsibility over the Rolls-Royce energy sales division, including the sale of equipment
manufactured and assembled by RRESI and on behalf of Rolls-Royce-affiliated entities in multiple
countries worldwide.

10. Andreas Kohler (âKohlerâ) was an Austrian national and employee of the Munich,

Germany office of Technical Advisor.
11. âForeign Official 1,â an individual whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was
a high-ranking Kazakh official of KazMunayGas, and thus was a âforeign officialâ within the
meaning of the FCPA. As an official of KazMunayGas, Foreign Official 1 had the authority to
exert official influence over purchasing decisions at AGP. CONTOGURIS, LESHKOV,
MARTIROSSIAN, and their co-conspirators often referred to Foreign Official 1 as âFoxâ or
âFuchs.â

12. âForeign Representative,â an individual whose identity is known to the Grand Jury,
was a Kazakh businessman and former Kazakh government official who acted as an agent and
representative for Foreign Official 1âs dealings with CONTOGURIS, Rolls-Royce, RRESI,
Technical Advisor, LESHKOV, and their co-conspirators.

13. âForeign Official 2,â an individual whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was
a high-ranking Chinese official of Petrochina and its subsidiaries, and thus was a âforeign officialâ
within the meaning of the FCPA. As an official of Petrochina and its subsidiaries, Foreign
Official 2 had the authority to exert official influence over purchasing decisions at AGP.

General Allegations

14. RRESI retained CONTOGURIS to pay bribes to various individuals, including
Foreign Official 1, in order to help Rolls-Royce and RRESI secure and maintain contracts with
AGP. After securing the contracts, RRESI paid CONTOGURIS a percentage of the payments it
received from AGP, which CONTOGURIS in turn divided with MARTIROSSIAN and
LESHKOV, with the understanding that a portion of that money would be provided to Foreign
Official 1.

15. Specifically, in or around 2007, Kazakh and Chinese state-owned oil and gas
companies entered into the AGP joint venture agreement to construct a gas pipeline stretching

between Central Asia and China. Rolls-Royce, through RRESI, was among several companies
4
bidding for contracts in the construction of the pipeline beginning in or around 2008. Rolls-Royce
employees, including Zuurhout, Barnett, and Finley, sought a commercial advisor with access to
key decision-makers in Kazakhstan in order to secure some of the contracts that AGP was going
to put out for tender. In particular, they had identified Foreign Official 1 as one of the key
decision-makers and were exploring ways to set up a meeting with Foreign Official 1. In or
around the same time, CONTOGURIS began working with LESHKOV, MARTIROSSIAN,
and Kohler to find a company willing to pay them kickbacks in exchange for them helping that
company win contracts with AGP, including by paying bribes to Foreign Official 1 and others.
16. Rolls-Royce and RRESI, through Zuurhout, Barnett, Finley, and others, began
working toward an agreement with CONTOGURIS, LESHKOV, MARTIROSSIAN, Kohler,
and others, in or around late 2008 when AGP was awarding the first project, Compressor Station
4. RRESI had put in its bid too late to influence the decision, however, and AGP awarded
Compressor Station 4 to RRESIâs main competitor, a U-S.-headquartered multinational company
(âthe Competitorâ), in or around March 2009. The sides still continued to work on coming to an
agreement whereby RRESI would pay CONTOGURIS a commission through his company
Gravitas, which CONTOGURIS, Foreign Official 1, LESHKOV, MARTIROSSIAN, Kohler,
and others, would split. AGP went on to award RRESIa contract for 11 of the 14 units comprising
Compressor Stations 1, 2, 6 and 7 in or around November 2009 for approximately $145 million.
AGP then made payments to RRESI starting in early 2010, and RRESI in turn made commission
payments to Gravitas. CONTOGURIS passed a portion of those commissions onto LESHKOV
and MARTIROSSIAN, knowing that a portion of those commissions would be shared with

Foreign Official 1 consistent with the corrupt agreement.
COUNT ONE
(Conspiracy to Violate the FCPA)

17. Paragraphs 1 through 16 are re-aileged and incorporated by reference as though
fully set forth herein.

18. Beginning at least in or around 2008 and continuing through in or around 2012,
within the Southern District of Ohio and elsewhere, the defendant,

PETROS CONTOGURIS, a/k/a
PETROS CONTOGURIS-TROEMEL,

did knowingly and willfully, that is, with the intent to further the objects of the conspiracy,
combine, conspire, confederate, and agree with others known and unknown, including, among
others, Zuurhout, Barnett, and Finley, to commit offenses against the United States, namely, to
willfully make use of the mails and means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce corruptly
in furtherance of an offer, payment, promise to pay, and authorization of the payment of any
money, offer, gift, promise to give, and authorization of the giving of anything of value, to a foreign
official and to any person, while knowing that all, or a portion of such money and things of value
would be and had been offered, given, and promised to a foreign official, for purposes of (i)
influencing acts and decisions of such foreign official in his or her official capacity; (ii) inducing
such foreign official to do and omit to do acts in violation of the lawful duty of such official; (iti)
securing any improper advantage; and (iv) inducing such foreign official to use his or her influence
with a foreign government and agencies and instrumentalities thereof, to affect and influence acts
and decisions of such government and agencies and instrumentalities, in order to assist RRESI in
obtaining and retaining business for and with, and directing business to, Rolls-Royce, RRESI,

CONTOGURIS, and others, in violation of Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2.
Objects of the Conspiracy

19. A principal purpose and object of the conspiracy was for CONTOGURIS and the
co-conspirators to enrich themselves by paying bribes to foreign officials in order to obtain and
retain business for Rolls-Royce, RRESI, and others, in connection with AGPâs gas pipeline

between Kazakhstan and China.

Manner and Means of the Conspiracy
20. The manner and means by which CONTOGURIS, together with his co-

conspirators and others known and unknown to the Grand Jury, sought to accomplish the object
of the conspiracy included, among other things, the following:

a. CONTOGURIS, Zuurhout, Barnett, Finley, Kohler, LESHKOV,
MARTIROSSIAN, and others, used telephone calls, Short Message Service (âSMSâ) and text
messages, and electronic mail (âe-mailâ), among other means, to discuss bribe payments to foreign
officials, including LESHKOV, MARTIROSSIAN, and Foreign Official 1, in connection with
Rolls-Royce and RRESIâs efforts to win business with AGP.

b. CONTOGURIS, Zuurhout, Barnett, Finley, Kohler, LESHKOV,
MARTIROSSIAN, and others, traveled to and from the United States and several other countries
to meet in person and arrange for bribe payments to be made to foreign officials, including
LESHKOV, MARTIROSSIAN, and Foreign Official 1, in order to assist Rolls-Royce and
RRESI in winning business with AGP.

@ CONTOGURIS, Zuurhout, Barnett, Finley, Kohler, LESHKOV,
MARTIROSSIAN, and others, arranged meetings with Foreign Official 1 and Foreign Official 2
in order to solidify their influence in support of Rolls-Royce and RRESIâs attempts to obtain and

retain business from AGP.
d. CONTOGURIS, Zuurhout, Barnett, Finley, Kohler, LESHKOV,
MARTIROSSIAN, and others, caused Rolls-Royce and RRESI to enter into an advisor agreement
with Gravitas, through which Rolls-Royce and RRESI paid commissions to Gravitas, which
included bribes bound for foreign officials, including LESHKOV, MARTIROSSIAN, and
Foreign Official 1.

e. CONTOGURIS, Zuurhout, Barnett, Finley, Kohler, LESHKOV,
MARTIROSSIAN, and others, took various surreptitious steps to promote and conceal the bribery
scheme, including by (i) using code names, such as âFoxâ and âFuchs,â to refer to Foreign Official
1, and (ii) concealing the bribe payments to Foreign Official 1 within RRESIâs commission
payments to Gravitas.

f. CONTOGURIS, Zuurhout, Barnett, Finley, Kohler, LESHKOV,
MARTIROSSIAN, and others, transferred and caused to be transferred funds, including bribe
payments, to and from bank accounts in the United States, Kazakhstan, the United Kingdom, the
Bahamas, Singapore, Hong Kong, Switzerland, and elsewhere, to promote and conceal the bribery
scheme.

g. CONTOGURIS, Zuurhout, Barnett, Finley, Kohler, LESHKOV,
MARTIROSSIAN, and others, discussed and disseminated confidential and internal AGP and
Technical Advisor documents and information to help Rolls-Royce and RRESI win business with
AGP.

h. CONTOGURIS, Zuurhout, Barnett, Finley, Kohler, LESHKOV,
MARTIROSSIAN, and others, used invoices in an attempt to provide the appearance of

legitimacy to the commission payments and fund transfers.
Overt Acts

21. In furtherance of the conspiracy and to achieve the objects thereof, at least one of
the co-conspirators committed, or caused to be committed, in the Southern District of Ohio and
elsewhere, at least one of the following overt acts, among others:

22. On or about September 25, 2008, CONTOGURIS, Foreign Representative, and
Zuurhout met in Moscow, Russia to discuss the ways in which CONTOGURIS and Foreign
Representative could assist Rolls-Royce in winning business from AGP.

23. On or about September 27, 2008, RRESI submitted a bid to AGP for Compressor
Station 4.

24. On or about October 30, 2008, CONTOGURIS and Finley flew to Kazakhstan,
where they met with Foreign Official 1 and Foreign Representative.

25. On or about November 5, 2008, LESHKOV e-mailed CONTOGURIS about
Foreign Official 1âs availability to meet with Finley in London. LESHKOV wrote that Foreign
Official 1, to whom he referred as âMr. Fox,â âadvised not to worry for the tender,â and that âthe
meeting in London will be an important oneâ and CONTOGURIS should âplease keep warm
RR.â

26. On or about November 27, 2008, Finley met with Foreign Official 2 and
MARTIROSSIAN in China and discussed potential business opportunities for Rolls-Royce with
AGP, including supplying the gas turbine compressor packages for Compressor Station 4.

27. On or about December 3, 2008, CONTOGURIS flew to London, England, where
he met with Finley, Kohler, Foreign Representative and Foreign Official 1.

28. | Onor about December 4, 2008, CONTOGURIS e-mailed Finley, copying Kohler,

and recounting the December 3, 2008 meeting, stating:
[Kohler] and I sincerely hope that all of your concerns were laid to rest during the meeting
with Mr. Fox. He has clearly taken a position and confirmed that [Foreign
Representative] is designated as a welcome and reliable local partner. . . . You also saw
how respectful [Foreign Representative] behaved vis-a-vis Mr. Fox. Everything is
marching in the right direction.

Mr. Fox authorized [Kohler] to let you benefit from receiving information when and if it

is being produced in order to give you more time to prepare. This is also an indication

that he wanted you to know that he is the âMaster of the gameâ.

29. On or about December 12, 2008, CONTOGURIS e-mailed Zuurhout and Finley a
copy of an internal AGP evaluation of the Competitorâs bid for Compressor Station 4.
CONTOGURIS wrote: âJob has not been awarded. Best tactic to follow is to let me know what
we offer in terms of short and medium/long term remuneration scheme. Will process this through
[Foreign Representative] and hope to turn it around. [MARTIROSSIAN] says Chinese have no
objection. Please do not make available to anyone else but addresses.â

30. On or about December 27, 2008, Finley e-mailed CONTOGURIS a proposed
engagement letter between Rolls-Royce and Gravitas for the AGP project that provided for
Gravitas to be paid a 2% commission on new equipment for the compressor stations on the pipeline
and a 6% commission for aftermarket sales.

31. On or about December 27, 2008, CONTOGURIS replied to Finleyâs e-mail
referenced in Paragraph 30 above, stating: â[LESHKOV] told me yesterday that [Foreign
Representative] would like to meet in Zurich . . . and take it to the next level.â

32. On or about December 27, 2008, CONTOGURIS forwarded to LESHKOV and
Kohler the Rolls-Royce engagement letter from Finley and added a recap of where things stood,
writing: âWe met with Mr. Fox and [Foreign Representative] on June 28th . . . and agreed on the
basic principle of cooperation. On the 29th of August we had the unsuccessful meeting with [the

Competitor] and commenced the canvassing of RR.â In the e-mail, CONTOGURIS also listed

the meetings with Zuurhout, Barnett, and Finley over the previous few months, as well as âdozens

10
of e-mail exchanges and telephone calls,â before noting: âWe are four partners,
[MARTIROSSIAN], [LESHKOV], [Kohler] and the undersigned.â

33. On or about January 11, 2009, CONTOGURIS e-mailed LESHKOV and Kohler,
and addressing LESHKOV, wrote:

It may be stated without any doubt that without the joint efforts of [Kohler], [LESHKOV]

and the undersigned (augmented by the valiant efforts of our friend and partner in Peking,

[MARTIROSSIAN]) the Kazakh Group led by [Foreign Representative] would not have

been able to proceed to the status quo we have managed to be elevated to. . . . The âsecretâ

weapon without much doubt, is the responsible role that the [Technical Advisor] is
requested to assist [AGP] with the adjudication process. . . . I will do my best to bring

[Zuurhout] and [Barnett] to the state-of-mind that will predicate our presence. . . . [YJour

contribution is to keep Fox in-line with the decision making process, however [Kohler]

needs to head our efforts to negotiate a workable and therefore profitable deal for us.

34. On or about January 15, 2009, Zuurhout, Barnett, and CONTOGURIS met with
Foreign Representative and his Swiss lawyers in Zurich, Switzerland. At the meeting, Foreign
Representative explained that Rolls-Royceâs proposed bribe of 2% of the price for new equipment
sales that Rolls-Royce received was not acceptable. Foreign Representative instead demanded a
bribe of 10% of the new equipment sales and threatened that Rolls-Royce would not win any
business if it did not agree.

35. On or about January 19, 2009, LESHIKOV e-mailed Kohler to update him on the
Zurich meeting and wrote: âThe main purpose was to find a deal for the future RR activity in Kz
and upcoming tender for CS 4. . RR informed they have no objection to a deal, but they need
a clear source and company to deal via.â

36. On or about January 19, 2009, CONTOGURIS e-mailed Zuurhout: âPlease let me
know whether or not I should try to utilize the forces of my friend and partner,
[MARTIROSSIAN], to impress upon [the Chinese side of AGP], to consider y(our) offer rather

than the one of [the Competitor].â

11
37. On or about January 19, 2009, Zuurhout replied to the e-mail referenced in
Paragraph 36 above, stating: âGive it a go.â

38.  Onor about January 20, 2009, Zuurhout e-mailed Barnett and Finley to report that
he had a phone call with Kohler and CONTOGURIS, and â[LESHKOV] is to meet mr fox either
tomorrow or friday. He needs input on how far rr is willing to go. As discussed with [Barnett]
last week this need[s] to come from reallicating [sic] the percentages. After that [Finley] [w]ill
need to meet mr fox to confirm this number on very short notice.â

39. On or about January 26, 2009, CONTOGURIS sent an e-mail to Zuurhout,
Barnett, and Finley, and wrote that in his âpersistent effort to render every kind of conceivable
effort and endeavor to assist RR energy to be awarded the CS 4 and/or other contracts,â he was
attaching internal AGP documents, which he summarized as demonstrating the Chinese side of
AGPâs preferences for certain turbine specifications that could favor the Competitor.
CONTOGURIS also proposed that Finley âauthorize [MARTIROSSIAN] to immediately
mobilize his considerable resources that Chinese authorities insist vis-4-vis Kazakh to also
consider RR offer in their comparison.â

40. On or about January 26, 2009, CONTOGURIS forwarded to MARTIROSSIAN
the e-mail referenced in Paragraph 39 above, and asked MARTIROSSIAN to confirm that he
received it.

41. On or about January 26, 2009, MARTIROSSIAN replied to the e-mail referenced
in Paragraph 40 above, stating, âYes I received.â

42. Â° On or about January 26, 2009, Zuurhout replied to CONTOGURISâs e-mail
referenced in Paragraph 39 above: âAs discussed earlier today we need all the support to turn
Kazakhstan into our favor. Please ask you[r] friend [MARTIROSSIAN] to work from his angle.

... ] look forward to discuss [sic] our proposal . . . on the alternative solution to CS4.â

12
43. On or about January 26, 2009, CONTOGURIS forwarded Zuurhoutâs reply in
Paragraph 42 to MARTIROSSIAN, copied Kohler, and wrote: â[MARTIROSSIAN], Please
read his answer, this is their clear authority to us . . . to proceed to try our utmost to save this CS 4
project. If you manage this with your top echelon contact, I am telling you and [Kohler] that they
(RR) would even ask us if we could save their Chinese project. . . .â

44, On or about January 26, 2009, Kohler e-mailed MARTIROSSIAN: âDear
[MARTIROSSIAN], please do your utmost that [the Chinese partner at AGP] will consider RRâs
proposal and start negotiations with them soonest. Copy of the RR bid will be submitted to you
immediately.â

45. On or about January 26, 2009, CONTOGURIS forwarded to MARTIROSSIAN
and Kohler an e-mail Zuurhout sent to CONTOGURIS about TRACE approval for Gravitas.
CONTOGURIS wrote: âDear [MARTIROSSIAN], . . . Once they send this conditions, they have
already âcrossedâ this line, i.e. they have internally decided to indeed work with us. Please note
that this is their âendorsementâ of [Kohler], Azat [|MARTIROSSIAN], Petros [CONTOGURIS],
Vitaly [LESHKOV].â

46. On or about January 26, 2009, MARTIROSSIAN responded to the e-mail
referenced in Paragraph 45 above, stating that he would keep in âclose contactâ with the Chinese
side of the AGP joint venture and that: âI am not for sure station No4 but I think it will be possible
involve Rols Roys [sic] in future. 1âll use also possibilities during Chinese New Year meetings
but the real work can be done after New Year holidays.â

47. On or about January 26, 2009, CONTOGURIS forwarded to MARTIROSSIAN
and Kohler another e-mail exchange between CONTOGURIS and Zuurhout, and added to the
subject line âURGENT PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL - 4 YOUR EYES ONLY.â

CONTOGURIS wrote that Zuurhout was trying to âinduce [Finley] to meet with Foxâ and
13
estimated that MARTIROSSIANâs âprovident access to top echelon decision makers in PROC,â
when âcombinedâ with âFoxâ would allow Rolls-Royce to get its âfoot into the door.â
CONTOGURIS wrote to them that âafter speaking to [MARTIROSSIAN] tonight and listening
carefully to him and to what he had to say, I could detect that he still has not lost all of his hope to
promote the CS 4[.]â

48, On or about January 29, 2009, Zuurhout e-mailed CONTOGURIS Rolls-Royceâs
proposed scope of supply for CS4 and wrote: â[the Chinese] should have the full proposal. . . .
Why donât you have MARTIROSSIAN use the PMC report... . Whom is he contacting [with the
Chinese]?â

49. On or about January 29, 2009, CONTOGURIS forwarded to MARTIROSSIAN
and Kohler the e-mail referenced in Paragraph 48 above.

50. On or about February 6, 2009, CONTOGURIS met with Zuurhout and Barnett in
London, where they informed CONTOGURIS that, based on the prior meeting in Zurich, they
would not move forward with CONTOGURIS as an advisor on the AGP bids if Foreign
Representative continued to be involved.

51. | Onor about February 24, 2009, CONTOGURIS and Kohler had a conference call
with Zuurhout and Barnett, in which they agreed that Rolls-Royce would continue to work with
CONTOGURIS on RRESIâs AGP bids without Foreign Representative.

52. On or about February 28, 2009, CONTOGURIS e-mailed LESHKOV, writing
that âthe offensive behavior of [Foreign Representative] has led RR to not want to collaborate with
him.â CONTOGURIS then proposed a way forward:

Ihave suggested you [LESHKOV] to be the official RR man on the ground in Kazkahstan

[sic], in whatever function. ... GM or Chief Advisor Kazakhstan or whatever... . You

secure the collaboration of your friend [Foreign Official 1]. Iam going to instal [sic] an
absolutely satisfactory system how future revenues are going to be distributed.

14
CONTOGURIS, switching to the third person, then wrote: âWe shall distribute 60% to your
friend and 10% each to our partner in China [MARTIROSSIAN], our partner in Kazakhstan
[LESHKOV)], our partner in Austria [Kohler] and our partner in Turkey [CONTOGURIS].â
CONTOGURIS also proposed paying Foreign Official 1 his split of the Gravitas commission
from Rolls-Royce through LESHKOV via a Singaporean shell company.

53. On or about March 5, 2009, LESHKOV responded to CONTOGURIS: âTI [met]
Mr. Fox and we also discussed RR issue. He agreed and has nothing against that I will be in
charge for dealing with RR. The scheme as in your e-mail might be implemented.â

54, On or about March 20, 2009, AGP awarded the contract for Compressor Station 4
to the Competitor.

55. On or about April 5, 2009, MARTIROSSIAN e-mailed CONTOGURIS and
Kohler, advising that a Chinese official would âensureâ Rolls-Royceâs invitation and qualification
for the AGP contract tenders by sending an e-mail on their behalf to the leader of the Chinese side
of the AGP joint venture. MARTIROSSIAN also advised that the Chinese official would keep
in close contact with MARTIROSSIAN âabout [the] situation for RR.â

56. On or about April 5, 2009, CONTOGURIS forwarded to Zuurhout, Barnett, and
Finley the e-mail referenced in Paragraph 55 above.

57. On or about May, 8, 2009, RRESI submitted its bid to supply AGP with 14 gas
turbine compressor packages for Compressor Stations 1, 2, 6, and 7.

58. On or about May 8, 2009, after Zuurhout, Barnett, Finley, and others at RRESI
realized that its margins were going to be much lower than it had first anticipated, Finley e-mailed
CONTOGURIS a new commission agreement which provided for a Gravitas commission reduced
from 2% to 1.5% on new equipment for the compressor stations on the pipeline and reduced from

6% to 3% for aftermarket sales.

15
59. On or about May 9, 2009, CONTOGURIS forwarded Finleyâs e-mail to
LESHKOV and wrote: âRR have told me that this is the absolute maximum they can afford in
their calculation, whilst still remaining competitive. [LESHKOV] please be so kind and speak
to your people and obtain their concurrence that this agreement should be countersigned and
entered into.â

60. Onor about May 12, 2009, LESHKOV replied to the e-mail from CONTOGURIS
referenced in Paragraph 59 above, stating: âI should have a private meeting with Mr. Fox in several
days. ... Meanwhile could you please advise â if I indicate 1,5% and then 3% and it [g]oes all to
Fox&company where is our interest to be ingaged [sic] in the process?â

61. On or about May 12, 2009, CONTOGURIS responded to the e-mail from
LESHKOV referenced in Paragraph 60 above, stating: âBottom line is that I do not know how
to answer your question. We have what we have and Fox has to at least share 2/3 1/3, we
definitely do not want the business otherwise. . . .[I]f Fox is not agreeable to support the RR fully
as and [sic] what we have on the table today, I will cancel the arrangement and tell them to go
ahead without our support.â

62. On or about June 6, 2009, LESHKOV e-mailed CONTOGURIS after
LESHKOV met with âFox,â and wrote:

Summary: R is very competitive from all points of view (technical and price). To

negotiate the relations with R, at this point he indicated that 1,5 and 3 is not acceptable and

proposed 3,5 and 3,5. But I clearly understood it is negotiable (I mean it should be a room

for us, otherwise bringing the Client and working with him for a year for free itâs a

nonsense). . . . I believe at least 0,5 should be reserved for us. . . .

63. On or about June 12, 2009, CONTOGURIS sent an e-mail to LESHKOV with
the subject line âour friends in London,â explaining that CONTOGURIS tried to push Rolls-

Royce to increase the Gravitas commission but it would not go further and was âprepared to walk

away from the transaction completely.â CONTOGURIS noted: âThe corporate governance
16
processes of this listed company is formidable, there are forty employees in a division that is
specifically designed to avoid exactly this what your friend wants to do now.â

64. On or about June 18, 2009, LESHKOV responded to the e-mail from
CONTOGURIS referenced in Paragraph 63 above, stating, âMr. Fox [wa]s getting angry,â that
the âproposed 3,5 [wa]s already the lowest ever on the market,â and that â[t]he arguments â âlisted
companyâ or âcorporate governance processâ they can leave for mass mediaâ because other âeven
bigger caliberâ companies were always able to find a âcompromise.â

65. On or about June 21, 2009, CONTOGURIS e-mailed LESHKOV and Kohler and
stated: âTell Mr. Fuchs to proceed as is and we will cede 75% of the current agreement to your
Singapore company. That means that you will receive 1.833.750,-USD at this stage and we will
be satisfied with 611.000,-USD.... As it is there are 6.7 Million lying on the table for Fuchs and
1.8 Million for us from phases 1 +2.â CONTOGURIS added: âThis is a listed company
operating in a country where anti-corruption laws are the strictest in Europe. If it had not been
for my 8 Billion USD track record and my business acumen shown, at least [Kohler] knows that,
there would not be a deal on the table.â

66. On or about July 12, 2009, CONTOGURIS e-mailed MARTIROSSIAN, and
copied Kohler, following a phone call between MARTEROSSIAN and CONTOGURIS.
CONTOGURIS, addressing MARTIROSSIAN as âBro Azat,â wrote that he agreed that the
âKazakhsâ should not be able to âget rewardedâ if they did not help, or worked against, Rolls-
Royce and that it would be âbetter to cancel the contract with RR and more honorable from our
side to do so, which is the ONLY way to remain truthful to our word to RR, whom we promised
our support.â CONTOGURIS then addressed Kohler, adding: âit is your obligation to now speak
to Mr. Fox and bring clarity into this. Without [MARTIROSSIAN]âs efforts the PROC side

would not have pronounced RR as the desired âwinnerâ. We know that [Foreign Official 2] went
17
to Kazakhstan to participate in the shareholders meeting of the JV, just for the purpose of
upholding the agreement with you bro Azat [MARTIROSSIAN]. Contoguris closed by stating
that he would âleave it to your wisdom [MARTIROSSIAN] and to [Kohlerâs] knowledge and
intuition, how to manage this matter in a judicious and transparent way vis-a-vis RR.â

67. On or about August 3, 2009, Barnett and Finley traveled to Astana, Kazakhstan and.
met with LESHKOV, where they discussed RRESIâs bid and prepared for AGPâs upcoming bid
clarification meetings.

68. On or about August 4, 2009, CONTOGURIS sent an e-mail to Finley, copying
Kohler, in which CONTOGURIS advised that he had learned that RRESIâs bid had a potential
technical deficiency in the proposed emissions efficiency and that one way to address it involved
going âthrough [MARTIROSSIAN]âs Chinese support structureâ where MARTIROSSIAN had
âunimaginable waysâ of âreachingâ into the Chinese government.

69. On or about August 10, 2009, LESHKOV e-mailed Finley: âI have discussed with
Fox the issue. Diplomatically he answered support will be provided, but now also a lot depends
on your technical clarification.â

70. On or about August 13, 2009, Barnett and Finley visited CONTOGURIS at his
home in Istanbul, Turkey and confirmed that they would increase the commission percentage
RRESI would pay to Gravitas for new equipment by .75% (for a total of 2.25%) if RRESI won all
14 turbines that were up for bid (for Compressor Stations 1, 2, 6 and 7), and .25% (for a total of
1.75%) if it won fewer than all 14.

71. On or about August 14, 2009, MARTIROSSIAN e-mailed CONTOGURIS and
relayed that he had learned that âChinese preferable option is: CS No-1 for [the Competitor] (from

supply schedule reason and âif Kazakh side can keep a faceâ). Other 3 station for RR... .â

18
72. On or about August 14, 2009, CONTOGURIS e-mailed LESHKOV and Kohler,
summarizing the split between Foreign Official 1 and LESHKOV, Kohler, MARTIROSSIAN,
and CONTOGURIS: âThat means the final picture is the following: In case all 14 machines are
awarded the Foxtrott Co will receive 1.50%, the balance will go to the âQuatrumphirateâ. In case
less than 14 machines, the 1.25% will go to Foxtrott Co and the balance will go to
âQuatrumphirate.â.â

73. On or about August 15, 2009, LESHKOV replied to the e-mail from
CONTOGURIS referenced in Paragraph 72 above, stating: âI made my best recently to sort out
at least our position towards [Finley] and lialize [sic] with Fox.â LESHKOV explained that
âTw]hat [wa]s more difficult was to influence [sic] [Technical Advisorâs] engineers!â

TA. On or about August 28, 2009, after individuals within the Kazakh side of AGP
circulated an internal memorandum deeming RRESIâs bid âtechnically unacceptableâ and
recommending disqualification, Kohler attached the memorandum to an email to
MARTIROSSIAN, and copied CONTOGURIS. Kohler noted that, âthe Kazakhs have used the
weak points of RR and calculated very high financial losses,â and asked MARTIROSSIAN,
âHow is the situation now?â

75. On or about August 28, 2009, CONTOGURIS forwarded to Finley the e-mail
referenced in Paragraph 74 above and wrote that MARTIROSSIAN was âreporting from Pekingâ
that a Chinese foreign official told him that nothing was decided yet and that they were âtrying
[their] best to increase the leverage from Chinese side, to stop the bloody Kazak [sic].â

76. On or about August 30, 2009, LESHKOV met with Foreign Official 1 to discuss
AGPâs internal recommendation to disqualify RRESI.

77. On or about September 6, 2009, Finley sent an SMS or âtext messageâ to

LESHKOV saying âthe deal with fox is cancelled.â
19
78. On or about September 7, 2009, LESHKOV e-mailed Finley, copied Barnett and
CONTOGURIS, and explained that Foreign Official 1 had âinitiated an internal investigationâ
into the memorandum disqualifying RRESI while Technical Advisor had refused to endorse it.
LESHKOV explained that â[b]ecause of Fox and our company position (plus to certain extend
[sic] Chinese position) [the disqualification] decision is blocked.â Referring to Finleyâs SMS,
LESHKOV then wrote âIâm stick [sic] to . . . agreements reached, unless they are cancelled. I
feel regret now to be involved in all this discussions (which, as gentlemen, we should keep
absolutely in high confidentiality). Also my reputation (in front of Fox, for example) can be
harmed.... Ikindly ask you asap to confirm/or not your sms.â

79. On or about September 11, 2009, CONTOGURIS e-mailed Barnett and Finley,
attaching a confidential written report from Technical Advisor setting out arguments for why the
internal memorandum disqualifying RRESI was incorrect and proclaiming that RRESIâs bid was
acceptable. In the e-mail, CONTOGURIS wrote: âI sincerely hope that your previously
mentioned grievances have been put to rest... . I am sure you can âuseâ this adequately. If you
cannot provide access of this document to your Chinese friends, please let me know and I will
inform [MARTIROSSIAN] to hand it over officially.â

80. On or about November 22, 2009, AGP awarded RRESI a contract to supply 11 of
the 14 gas turbine compressor packages for approximately $145 million.

81. Approximately three days later, on or about November 25, 2009, Gravitas and
RRESI executed a written advisor agreement.

82. On or about the following dates, CONTOGURIS, Zuurhout, Barnett, Finley,
Kohler, LESHKOV, MARTIROSSIAN, and others, caused AGP to make the following corrupt
payments from AGPâs bank accounts in Kazakhstan to bank accounts belonging to RRESI in

Mount Vernon, Ohio, located in the Southern District of Ohio, with the knowledge and intent that

84. In or around February 2010, CONTOGURIS lobbied Finley for a 2.25%
commission (which they had agreed would only be paid had RRESI won 14 units) even though
RRESI won fewer than the 14 total units up for bid.

85. On or about February 27, 2010, after Finley refused to pay more than the agreed
upon 1.75%, CONTOGURIS sent Finley an SMS: âVery sad that after positioning RR with a lot
of patience and continuous follow-up from my side, that you have not seen it necessary to
personally attend to outstanding matters, which is necessary.â

86. | Onor about February 27, 2010, CONTOGURIS forwarded the SMS referenced in
Paragraph 85 above as an e-mail to Kohler and wrote: âTell Fuchs no dice from RR.â

87. In or around August 2010, after negotiations, LESHKOV told CONTOGURIS
and Kohler that Foreign Official 1 would agree to accept a lump sum of $500,000 USD from
CONTOGURIS as the payment for the RRESI award rather than wait until CONTOGURIS
received all of the commission payments from RRESI.

88. On or about September 19, 2010, LESHKOV sent an e-mail to CONTOGURIS
and Kohler, in which he attached a document with details for his Singaporean shell corporation

and wrote: âKindly asking you to proceed.â

22
89. On or about February 14, 2011, CONTOGURIS made the first of approximately
six transfers of the commissions RRESI paid to Gravitas from the U.K. bank account to accounts
in the Bahamas and Switzerland.

90. On or about February 14, 2011, LESHKOVâs accountant sent LESHKOV five
false invoices from MARTIROSSIAN to LESHKOVâs Singaporean shell corporation for
purported work done on a âbusiness development project in China carried out in 2008,â before

MARTIROSSIANâs bank account in Hong Kong approximately three days later.

91. On or about March 15, 2011, CONTOGURIS wired $500,000 from a bank account

a subject of âFinal payment of personal debts,â and wrote: âI finally managed to make the transfer
yesterday and have finally been able to settle all the loans extended to me. . . as agreed, total sum
500K.â

93. On or about March 9, 2012, approximately one day after RRESI paid its last

$232,223 of the $236,975 to his bank account in Switzerland.

94, On or about April 11, 2012, MARTIROSSIAN e-mailed CONTOGURIS two
invoices, both dated March 30, 2012, each in the amount of $25,000. The invoices requested
