The Grand Jury for the District of Maryland charges that:
Introduction
At times material to this Indictment:
Relevant Entities and Individuals

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act

11. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (âFCPAâ), as amended, Title 15,
United States Code, Sections 78dd-1, et seg., was enacted by Congress for the purpose of, among
other things, making it unlawful to act corruptly in furtherance of an offer, promise,
authorization, or payment of money or anything of value, directly or indirectly, to a foreign
government official for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business for, or directing business
to, any person.

The Scheme to Defraud and Make Corrupt Payments

12. | At some point in or before 2009, defendant LAMBERT and Condrey learned that
Co-Conspirator One had agreed with Mikerin to make corrupt bribe and kickback payments in
order for Transportation Corporation A to obtain and retain business and contracts with TENEX.
Co-Conspirator One explained that the amount of each corrupt payment was based on an
agreement with Mikerin to kickback a percentage of certain contract awards that TENEX
awarded to Transportation Corporation A to benefit Mikerin, and that Mikerin would help
Transportation Corporation A win contract awards with TENEX if such corrupt payments were
made. Soon after learning of the corrupt and fraudulent scheme, defendant LAMBERT and
Condrey agreed to enter into the conspiracy with Co-Conspirator One to make corrupt and
fraudulent bribe and kickback payments to offshore bank accounts to benefit Mikerin in order to

help Transportation Corporation A obtain and retain business with TENEX.
 

 

Case 8:18-cr-00012-TDC Document 1 Filed 01/10/18 Page 5 of 24

13. In order to conceal and further the scheme, the co-conspirators, including
defendant LAMBERT and Condrey, used the terms âremunerationâ and âcommissionâ when
documenting the corrupt and fraudulent payments on an internal spreadsheet and when
communicating with unknowing Transportation Corporation A employees who unwittingly
processed the corrupt and fraudulent payments to offshore accounts.

14. âIn order to justify Transportation Corporation Aâs corrupt and fraudulent
payments to offshore accounts to benefit Mikerin, and to generate the money to make the
payments, defendant LAMBERT, Condrey and others, including Co-Conspirator One and
Mikerin, caused fake invoices to be prepared, which purported to be from TENEX to
Transportation Corporation A and which fraudulently described services that were never
provided by TENEX to Transportation Corporation A. Defendant LAMBERT, Condrey, and
others, including Co-Conspirator One, caused Transportation Corporation A to make the corrupt
and fraudulent payments after Transportation Corporation A received the fraudulent invoices.

15. Co-Conspirator One left Transportation Corporation A in early 2010, but
continued to work as a consultant to Transportation Corporation A. Upon Co-Conspirator
Oneâs departure from Transportation Corporation A, defendant LAMBERT and Condrey
became co-Presidents of Transportation Corporation A and continued to conspire with Co-
Conspirator One to communicate with Mikerin and facilitate the corrupt and fraudulent bribe and
kickback payments.

16. Co-Conspirator One died in or around August 2011. After Co-Conspirator
Oneâs death and continuing through in or around October 2014, defendant LAMBERT and

Condrey continued the corrupt and fraudulent bribe and kickback scheme and communicated
Case 8:18-cr-00012-TDC Document1 Filed 01/10/18 Page 6 of 24

directly with Mikerin to obtain fraudulent invoices and facilitate the corrupt and fraudulent

payments.

The Conspiracy

17. From in or around 2004 and continuing through in or around October 2014, in the
District of Maryland and elsewhere, the defendant,
MARK T. LAMBERT,
did knowingly and willfully, that is, with the intent to further the objects of the conspiracy,
combine, conspire, confederate, and agree with Condrey, Co-Conspirator One and others, known
and unknown, to commit offenses against the United States, namely:

a. to willfully make use of the mails and means and instrumentalities of
interstate commerce corruptly in furtherance of an offer, payment, promise to pay, and
authorization of the payment of any money, offer, gift, promise to give, and authorization of the
giving of anything of value, to a foreign official, and to a person, while knowing that all or a
portion of such money and thing of value would be and had been offered, given, and promised to
a foreign official, for purposes of: (i) influencing acts and decisions of such foreign official in his
or her official capacity; (ii) inducing such foreign official to do and omit to do acts in violation of
the lawful duty of such official; (iii) securing an improper advantage; and (iv) inducing such
foreign official to use his or her influence with a foreign government and agencies and
instrumentalities thereof to affect and influence acts and decisions of such government and
agencies and instrumentalities, in order to assist defendant LAMBERT, Condrey, Co-

Conspirator One, Transportation Corporation A, and others in obtaining and retaining business
 

Case 8:18-cr-00012-TDC Document1 Filed 01/10/18 Page 7 of 24

for and with, and directing business to, Transportation Corporation A and others, in violation of
Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2; and

b. to knowingly and with the intent to defraud, devise, and intend to devise a
scheme and artifice to defraud, and for obtaining money and property by means of materially
false and fraudulent pretenses, representations, and promises, knowing that the pretenses,
representations, and promises were false and fraudulent when made, and did knowingly transmit
-and cause to be transmitted, by means of wire communication in interstate commerce, writings,
signs, signals, pictures, and sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme and artifice in
violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1343.

Manner and Means of the Conspiracy

18. | The manner and means by which defendant LAMBERT and others, including
Condrey and Co-Conspirator One, sought to accomplish the objects of the conspiracy included,
among other things, the following:

19. It was part of the conspiracy that defendant LAMBERT and others, including
Condrey and Co-Conspirator One, offered to pay, promised to pay, and authorized corrupt and
fraudulent bribe and kickback payments for the benefit of Mikerin, in exchange for Mikerinâs
agreement to help Transportation Corporation A secure business and contracts with TENEX.

20. It was further part of the conspiracy that defendant LAMBERT and others,
including Condrey and Co-Conspirator One, discussed in person, and through, among other
means, electronic mail (âemailâ) and text messaging, making corrupt and fraudulent bribe and
kickback payments to offshore accounts to benefit Mikerin in order for Transportation

Corporation A to obtain and retain business with TENEX.
Case 8:18-cr-00012-TDC Document1 Filed 01/10/18 Page 8 of 24

21. âIt was further part of the conspiracy that defendant LAMBERT and others,
including Condrey and Co-Conspirator One, concealed their scheme by using code words like

99 66.

âlucky figure,â âLF,â âlucky numbers,â âcake,â âremuneration,â and âcommissionâ when
communicating about the corrupt and fraudulent bribe and kickback scheme.

22. It was further part of the conspiracy that defendant LAMBERT and others,
including Condrey and Co-Conspirator One, emailed with Mikerin at Mikerinâs personal email
address to discuss the corrupt and fraudulent bribery and kickback scheme, in order to evade
detection by other TENEX officials and others who were not benefiting from the scheme.

23. It was further part of the conspiracy that defendant LAMBERT and others,
including Condrey and Co-Conspirator One, caused fraudulent invoices to be created and
transmitted by email to others in order to document purported services that were not actually
provided to Transportation Corporation A and to justify the payment of corrupt and fraudulent
bribes and kickbacks to offshore accounts.

24. It was further part of the conspiracy that defendant LAMBERT, Condrey, and
Co-Conspirator One kept track of the corrupt bribe and kickback payments that had been made
and were pending, and they agreed with Mikerin that the amount of each corrupt and fraudulent
payment was based on an agreed-upon percentage of certain TENEX contract payments to
Transportation Corporation A.

25. It was further part of the conspiracy that defendant LAMBERT and others,
including Condrey and Co-Conspirator One, concealed their corrupt and fraudulent bribe and

kickback payments in a manner that allowed those payments to go undetected by certain TENEX

officials and caused TENEX to overpay for Transportation Corporation Aâs services.
 

 

Case 8:18-cr-00012-TDC Document1 Filed 01/10/18 Page 9 of 24

26. â It was further part of the conspiracy that defendant LAMBERT and others,
including Condrey and Co-Conspirator One, caused Transportation Corporation A to wire
corrupt and fraudulent bribe and kickback payments from Transportation Corporation Aâs bank
account in Maryland to offshore bank accounts associated with companies that had no legitimate
business relationship with Transportation Corporation A, such as Shell Company A in the
Republic of Cyprus, Shell Company B in Latvia, and Shell Company C in Switzerland, for the
purpose of executing and concealing the corrupt and fraudulent payments.

Overt Acts

In furtherance of the conspiracy, and to achieve the objects thereof, at least one of the
conspirators committed, and caused to be committed, in the District of Maryland and elsewhere,
at least one of the following overt acts, among others:

competitors,â in exchange for additional corrupt bribe and kickback payments. In the email,
Mikerin requested, in relevant part, that defendant LAMBERT and Condrey âinitiate from your
side new quotations for filled and empty cylinders transportationâ for 2012 and 2013 and
specified that the ârates should include new Lucky Figures.â

B. On or about September 23, 2011, defendant LAMBERT replied to Mikerinâs
