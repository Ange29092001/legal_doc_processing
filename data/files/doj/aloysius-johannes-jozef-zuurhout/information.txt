Istanbul, where they discussed the corrupt scheme and that the Kazakhs, including Foreign

Conspirator 3 met in Zurich, Switzerland with others purporting to represent Foreign Official.

to meet Foreign Officialâs expectations. Defendant ZUURHOUT also explained that Co-
Conspirator 5 would be meeting with Foreign Official, and defendant ZUURHOUT suggested
