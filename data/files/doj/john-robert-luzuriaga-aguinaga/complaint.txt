bribery of a public official, as translated from Spanish:

OVERVIEW OF THE SCHEME TO LAUNDER BRIBERY PROCEEDS

 

15. As described in greater detail below, JOHN ROBERT
LUZURIAGA AGUINAGA, while acting as the ISSPOL Risk. Director and.
sitting on ISSPOLâs Investment. Committee, received bribes totaling
at least approximately $1,397,066 from the U.S. Investment Fund
Companies controlled by Investment Advisor, in exchange for using

his official position to -assist the U.S. Investment Fund Companies,
Investment Advisor, and others to obtain and retain business for

Investment Advisor, Investment Advisor Panama Company 1, and.
others in violation of the FCPA and Ectuiadorâs law against bribery

of a public official.

16. In order to conceal and disguise the proceeds of

the bribery scheme and with the intent to promote the carrying on
of the bribery scheme, JOHN ROBERT LUZURIAGA AGUINAGA and
Investment Advisor, together with others, among other things,

caused bribery proceeds to be laundered through bank accounts in.
the United States for the benefit of JOHN ROBERT LUZURIAGA AGUINAGA

and others, in violation of U.S: money laundering laws.
INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

17. From my review of emails, contracts, documents,
bank records, witness interviews and from my participation in this
investigation, I have learned, among other things, the following:

18. From at. least in or around 2014 through at least in

or around 2019, JOHN ROBERT LUZURIAGA AGUINAGA, as the Risk
Director of. ISSPOL and sitting on ISSPOLâs Investment. Committee,
had influence over ISPSPOL investment decisions, including who
ISSPOL hired to invest its funds.

19. In or around December 2015 and January 2016, ISSPOL

entered into an agreement with Investment Advisor Panama Company
2 (âswap transactionâ). This agreement was reviewed and approved
by JOHN ROBERT LUZURIAGA AGUINAGA and others.

20. The payment streams resulting from the swap

transaction demonstrates that Investment Advisorâs companies
received more money earlier and more money overall at the expense
of ISSPOL. For example, in 2017, Investment Advisor Pahama, Company
1 received approximately $40.5 million as a result of this swap
transaction. By contrast, under the swap transaction, ISSPOL

discrepancies, between in or around 2016 and in or around 2019,
Investment Advisor, through his Panama companies,. profited
approximately $65 million on this swap transaction.

promise to repurchase the bonds at a set date for a set amount
that included interest.

23. Investment Advisor Panama Company 1 has failed to
meÃ©t payment obligations to ISSPOL on more than half of the bond
repurchase transactions. As of in or around August 2020,
approximately $111 million in repurchase agreements were overdue
out of a total of approximately $205 million.

located in the Southern District of Florida, Investment Advisor
sent text messages to JOHN ROBERT LUZURIAGA AGUINAGA requesting

(translated. from Spanish) âgood news.â JOHN ROBERT LUZURIAGA

and sent a text message stating â47908.

41. Based on the foregoing, there is probable cause to
believe that, from in or around 2014 through at least in or around
2020, Investment Advisor, an officer, director, employee, of agent,
of a âdomestic concernâ under the FCPA, willfully and corruptly
made use of the mails and means and instrumentalities of interstate
commÃ©rce in furtherance of an offer, payment, and promise to make
payments for the benefit of JOHN ROBERT LUZURIAGA AGUINAGA for the:
purpose of influencing JOHN ROBERT LUZURIAGA AGUINAGA to use his

and directing business to, Investment Advisor, Investment
Advisorâs Panama companies, and others, in violation of Title 15,
United States Code, Section 78dd-2.

42, Based on the foregoing, there is also probable
cause to believe that, from in or around 2014 through at least in

9

 
 

Case 1:21-mj-02270-AOR Document 3 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/11/2021 Page 12 of 13

means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce or took an act.
in furtherance of an offer, payment, and promise to make payments

himself, Investment Advisor's Panama companies, and others, in,
violation of Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-3.

43. âBased on the foregoing, and based on my review of
the Ecuadorian, Penal Code, therÃ© is also probable cause to believe
that the bribery scheme conducted by Investment Advisor, JOHN
ROBERT LUZURIAGA AGUINAGA, and others as described above, in which
JOHN ROBERT LUZURIAGA AGUINAGA received bribes from Investment.
Advisor in exchange for, among other things, obtaining and
retaining investment business from ISSPOL, was an offense under,
inter alia, Ecuadorian law prohibiting bribery of public
officials.

44, Based on the foregoing, there is also probable
cause to believe that, from in or around 2014 through at least in
or around 2020, Investment Advisor, JOHN ROBERT LUZURIAGA
AGUINAGA, and others conspired to commit money laundering.
Specifically, there is probable cause to believe that Investment
Advisor conspired with JOHN ROBERT LUZURIAGA AGUINAGA, and others,
to launder bribery proceeds in U.S. currency through bank accounts,
including bank accounts in the United States, with the intent to
promote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity and in order
to conceal the nature, location, source, ownership, and control of
