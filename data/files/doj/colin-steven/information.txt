COUNT ONE
(Conspiracy to Violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act)

| Overview

1. From in or about November 2009, up to and including in
or about April 2011, COLIN STEVEN, the defendant, engaged in an
international conspiracy to bribe an official of the Kingdom of
Saudi Arabia (the âSaudi Arabia Officialâ) in connection with
the $93 million sale of jets from STEVENâs employer, Embraer
S.A. (âEmbraerâ), to a company located 1n Saudi Arabia (the
âSaudi Arabia Companyâ). As part of the schemÃ©, STEVEN caused
approximately $1.5 million in bribe payments to be made by
Embraer to the Saudi Arabia Official through an intermediary
company located in South Africa (the âSouth Africa Companyâ) .
In exchange for those payments, the Saudi Arabia Official

provided more favorable terms to Embraer in a sale of jets to

the Saudi Arabia Company. As a further part of the scheme,

STEVEN arranged to and did receive a kickback from a portion of
the bribe proceeds.
Relevant Persons and Entities

2. At all times relevant to this Information, Embraer was
an aircraft manufacturer based in Brazil, with operations and
subsidiaries in various locations around the world, including
the United States and the Middle East. Embraer manufactured
commercial, executive, and defense aircraft for governmental: and
private customers throughout the world. Embraerâs American
depositary shares were listed and traded on the New York Stock
Exchange, and Embraer was required to file periodic reports with
the Securities and Exchange Commission under Section 15(d) of
the Securities Exchange Act, Title 15, United States Code,
Section 780(d). Accordingly, Embraer was an issuer within the
meaning of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (âFCPAâ), Title 15,
United States Code, Sections 78dd-1 and 78m. Embraer
Representations LLC (âEmbraer RLâ) was a subsidiary wholly owned
by Embraer and incorporated in Delaware. Embraer RL maintained
a bank account in Manhattan, New York.

3. At all times relevant to this Information, COLIN
STEVEN, the defendant, was a British national. Until December
2013, STEVEN was an executive in Embraerâs Executive Jets
Division and had responsibility for overseeing the generation of
sales in regions that included the Middle East. Accordingly,

2

 
Case i:1?7-cr-00788-A.N Bocument2 -Fied Tsfeii? Page Sof 24

STEVEN was an âemployeeâ and âagentâ of an issuer within the
meaning of the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-
1.

4. The Saudi Arabia Company was the state-owned and
state-controlled national oil company of Saudi Arabia, and
performed a function that Saudi Arabia treated as its own.
Accordingly, the Saudi Arabia Company was an âinstrumentalityâ
of a foreign government within the meaning of the FCPA, Title
15, United States Code, Section 78dd-1(f) (1). The Saudi Arabia
Official was a high-level official at the Saudi Arabia Company
who had influence over aircraft purchasing decisions.

5. The South Africa Company was an industrial valve and
pump manufacturer partially owned by friends of COLIN STEVEN,.
the defendant. As of the time of the events described in this
Information, the South Africa Company had no experience in the
aircraft industry or in Saudi Arabia.

The FCPA Bribery Scheme

 

6. From in or about November 2009 through in or about
April 2011, COLIN STEVEN, with others, agreed to pay, and caused
and aided and abetted Embraerâs actual payment of, approximately
$1.5 million in bribes to the Saudi Arabia Official in order to
obtain a contract between the Saudi Arabia Company and Embraer
for the sale of three business jets, valued at approximately $93

million.

 
at

7. %In his capacity as an executive with Embraerâs
Executive Jets Division, COLIN STEVEN, the defendant, oversaw
staff who were responsible for selling new and used Embraer
aircraft. Both Embraerâs revenue and employeesâ sales
commissions, including for STEVEN and the sales agents he
supervised, were significantly higher for sales of new aircraft
compared to used aircraft.

8. In or about 2006, COLIN STEVEN, the defendant, and
others at Embraer learned that the Saudi Arabia Company was
interested in purchasing aircraft. Thereafter, and until in or
about the fall of 2009, STEVEN and a salesperson who reported to
him had occasional contact with employees of the Saudi Arabia
Company, and periodically discussed the potential sale of
Embraer aircraft. During that period, STEVEN learned that the
Saudi Arabia Company was interested in purchasing used aircraft.

9. In or about late 2009, COLIN STEVEN, the defendant,
met with the Saudi Arabia Official in London, England. The
Saudi Arabia Official offered to help Embraer win the aircraft
contract from the Saudi Arabia Company, and to change the deal
from used jets to new jets if Embraer paid the Saudi Arabia
Official. STEVEN knew that the Saudi Arabia Official was a
high-level official at the Saudi Arabia Company and believed

that the Saudi Arabia Official could deliver on the promise.

10. Over the course of multiple discussions in London,
England, and with the approval of his supervisor (âEmbraer
Executive Aâ), COLIN STEVEN, the defendant, and the Saudi Arabia
Official agreed on a per-aircraft payment of $550,000 to be paid
to the Saudi Arabia Official, for a total bribe amount of $1.65
million.

Til. On or about December 10, 2009, COLIN STEVEN, the
defendant, sent an email to Embraer Executive A and another
Embraer executive (âEmbraer Executive Bâ), in which STEVEN
wrote, in part, that the Saudi Arabia Official âhas budget [ed]
for used [aircraft] only and will have to lobby for more funds
to take new [aircraft] over used.â Defendant STEVEN added,
â[t]here is more to come to replace the entire fleet they have
with [Embraer model] 170,s [sic] [Saudi Arabia Official] sees.
this as long term.â Embraer Executive A approved offering a
per-aircraft payment of $550,000 to the Saudi Arabia Official.

12. In or about late 2009 and early 2010, COLIN STEVEN,
the defendant, developed a plan to use the South Africa Company
as a purported agent on the transaction with the Saudi Arabia
Company. As a result, Embraer would pay $1.65 million in
âfinders feesâ to the South Africa Company. In truth and in
fact, the South Africa Company would perform no work on the
transaction and would be used to facilitate and to disguise the
payment to the Saudi Arabia Official.

5

 
Case :i?-cr-00788-A.N Bocument2 Filed Tgfeia? Page 6 of 24

13. Between in or about late 2009 and in or about early
2010, COLIN STEVEN, the defendant, had a telephone conversation
with an executive at Embraer (âEmbraer Executive Câ), in which
STEVEN described the planned bribery scheme and the plan to use
the South Africa Company as the entity that would pass the
payments to the Saudi Arabia Official. Embraer Executive C
reassured STEVEN that South Africa Company could be trusted to
pass on the money to the Saudi Arabia Official.

14. In or about early 2010, acting on the Saudi Arabia
Officialâs recommendation, a committee at the Saudi Arabia
Company approved the Saudi Arabia Companyâs purchase of three
new aircraft from Embraer for $93 million.

15. On or about March 5, 2010, Embraer RL executed an
agreement with the South Africa Company, pursuant to which the
South Africa Company would purportedly âpromote sales of ....
aircraft manufactured by Embraer . . . solely and specifically
toâ a subsidiary of the Saudi Arabia Company. In reality, the
South Africa Company provided no services to Embraer other than
serving as a conduit to funnel payments to the Saudi Arabia
Official. The agreement did not disclose that the payments were
ultimately bound for the Saudi Arabia Official.

16. Less than two weeks later, on or about March 15, 2010,
Embraer and a U.S.-based subsidiary of the Saudi Arabia Company

entered into an aircraft purchase agreement, pursuant to which

6

 
Case i:1?7-cr-00788-A.N Bocument2 Filed lafeia? Page 7 of 24

the subsidiary agreed to purchase three new aircraft for
approximately $93 million. The aircraft were delivered in or
around November and December 2010.

17. In or about December 2010, the South Africa Company
submitted three invoices to Embraer, each in the amount of
$550,000, for its purported commission, even though it had not
rendered any services to Embraer in connection with the sale.
Executives at Embraer approved paying the invoices. The
payments were made through two wire transfers from Embraer RLâs
bank account in Manhattan, New York, to the South Africa
Companyâs bank account in South Africa: $550,000 on or about
December 22, 2010, and $1.1 million on or about February 18,
2011.

18. Between on or about February 2, 2011, and on or about
April 5, 2011, the South Africa Company made three wire
transfers totaling $1,434,100 to bank accounts in Switzerland
and Bahrain held by an individual who was acting as an
intermediary for the Saudi Arabia Official (âIntermediary Aâ).
Intermediary A kept a portion of the funds and transferred the

remainder to the Saudi Arabia Official.

The Kickback Scheme

19. As set forth below, COLIN STEVEN, the defendant,
caused a portion of the fraudulent payment that Embraer RL made
to the South Africa Company to be paid to STEVEN as a kickback.
In total, STEVEN received approximately $129,935 in kickbacks.

20. In or about late 2009 and early 2010, while COLIN
STEVEN, the defendant, with others, was arranging to pay the
Saudi Arabia Official, STEVEN also developed a plan to take a
portion of the money as a kickback. STEVEN discussed this plan
with Embraer Executive C, and the two agreed that STEVEN,
Embraer Executive C, and the South Africa Company would each
take a portion of the $1.65 million to be paid by Embraer RL.

21. At the direction of COLIN STEVEN, the defendant, and
unbeknownst to Embraer, the South Africa Company transferred to
STEVENâs United States bank account $129,935 of the $1.65
million it had received from Embraer RL: $97,465 on or about
October 21, 2011, and $32,470 on or about December 1, 2011.
Those wire transfers passed through a bank in Manhattan, New
York.

22. COLIN STEVEN, the defendant, and Embraer Executive C,
who had recently been promoted within the company, subsequently
had a telephone conversation in which Embraer Executive C

informed STEVEN that Embraer Executive C no longer wanted his

 
Pg

Case i:1?7-cr-00788-A.N Bocument2 Filed Tgfeii? Page @ of 24

share of the money. As a result, STEVEN kept all of the
$129,935 he received from the South Africa Company.

23. In or about March 2010 and November 2010, Embraer paid
COLIN STEVEN, the defendant, a total of $44,000 in commissions
based on the sale of the three new aircraft to Saudi Arabia
Company.

24. On or about December 19, 2014, COLIN STEVEN, the
defendant, was interviewed by an agent of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (âFBIâ). During that interview, when asked about
one of the wire transfers he received from the South Africa
Company in 2011, STEVEN falsely stated that the funds had been
transferred to him by an executive of the South Africa Company
for the purpose of buying real estate in connection with a
potential business venture between STEVEN and the executive.
