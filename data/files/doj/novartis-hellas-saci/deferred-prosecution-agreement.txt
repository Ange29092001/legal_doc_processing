DEFERRED PROSECUTION AGREEMENT

Defendant Novartis Hellas S.A.C.I. (âNovartis Hellasâ or the âCompanyâ), pursuant to the
authority granted by the Companyâs Board of Directors reflected in Attachment B, which is
incorporated by reference into this Agreement, and the United States Department of Justice,
Criminal Division, Fraud Section (the âFraud Sectionâ) and the United States Attorneyâs Office
for the District of New Jersey (the âOfficeââ), enter into this deferred prosecution agreement (the
âAgreementâ). Novartis AG, which is not a defendant in this matter, also agrees, pursuant to the
authority granted by Novartis AGâs Board of Directors, to certain terms and obligations of the
Agreement as described below. The terms and conditions of this Agreement are as follows:

Criminal Information and Acceptance of Responsibility

1. The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Fraud Section and the Office will
file the attached two-count criminal Information (the âInformationâ) in the United States District
Court for the District of New Jersey charging the Company with one count of conspiracy to commit

an offense against the United States, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 371, that

is, to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (âFCPAâ),
as amended, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-3, and one count of conspiracy to commit
an offense against the United States, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 371, that
is, to violate the books and records provision of the FCPA, as amended, Title 15, United States
Code, Sections 78m(b)(2)(A), 78m(b)(5), and 78ff(a). In so doing, the Company: (a) knowingly
waives its right to indictment on these charges, as well as all rights to a speedy trial pursuant to the
Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, Title 18, United States Code, Section 3161,
and Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 48(b); and (b) knowingly waives any objection with
respect to venue to any charges by the United States arising out of the conduct described in the
Statement of Facts attached as Attachment A (the âStatement of Factsâ), which is incorporated
into this Agreement, and consents to the filing of the Information, as provided under the terms of
this Agreement, in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. The Fraud
Section and the Office agree to defer prosecution of the Company pursuant to the terms and
conditions described below.

2. The Company admits, accepts, and acknowledges that it is responsible under United
States law for the acts of its officers, directors, employees, and agents as charged in the
Information, and as set forth in the Statement of Facts, and that the allegations described in the
Information and the facts described in the Statement of Facts are true and accurate. Should the
Fraud Section or the Office pursue the prosecution that is deferred by this Agreement, the
Company and Novartis AG stipulate to the admissibility of the attached Statement of Facts in any
proceeding by the Fraud Section or the Office, including any trial, guilty plea, or sentencing

proceeding, and will not contradict anything in the Statement of Facts at any such proceeding.
Case 2:20-cr-00538-SDW Document 2 Filed 06/25/20 Page 3 of 79 PagelD: 27

Term of the Agreement

3. This Agreement is effective for a period beginning on the date on which the
Information is filed and ending three years from that date (the âTermâ). The Company, and the
parent company, Novartis AG, agree, however, that, in the event the Fraud Section and the Office
determine, in their sole discretion, that the Company or Novartis AG has knowingly violated any
provision of this Agreement or has failed to completely perform or fulfill each of the Companyâs
or Novartis AGâs obligations under this Agreement, an extension or extensions of the Term of the
Agreement may be imposed by the Fraud Section and the Office, in their sole discretion, for up to
a total additional time period of one year, without prejudice to the Fraud Sectionâs or the Officeâs
right to proceed as provided in Paragraphs 14 to 18 below. Any extension of the Agreement
extends all terms of this Agreement, including the terms of the reporting requirement in
Attachment D (the âReporting Requirementsâ), for an equivalent period. Conversely, in the event
the Fraud Section and the Office find, in their sole discretion, that there exists a change in
circumstances sufficient to eliminate the Reporting Requirements, and that the other provisions of
this Agreement have been satisfied, the Agreement may be terminated early. If the Court rejects
the Agreement, all the provisions of the Agreement shall be deemed null and void, and the Term
shall be deemed to have not begun.

Relevant Considerations

4. The Fraud Section and the Office enter into this Agreement based on the individual

facts and circumstances presented by this case and by the Company and Novartis AG, including:

a. the Company did not receive voluntary disclosure credit pursuant to the
FCPA Corporate Enforcement Policy in the Department of Justice Manual 9-47.120, or pursuant
to the United States Sentencing Guidelines (âU.S.S.G.â or âSentencing Guidelinesâ), because it
did not voluntarily self-disclose to the Fraud Section and the Office the conduct described in the
attached Statement of Facts;

b. the Company received full credit for its cooperation and Novartis AGâs
cooperation with the Fraud Sectionâs and the Officeâs investigation, including conducting a
thorough internal investigation; making regular factual presentations to the Fraud Section and the
Office; producing extensive documentation, including documents located outside of the United
States, after taking steps that the Company and its affiliates determined complied with applicable
foreign data privacy, confidentiality, and discovery laws; and providing translations of foreign
language documents;

C. the Company and Novartis AG engaged in remedial measures, including
implementing revised and enhanced policies and procedures relating to, among other things,
accounting, anti-corruption, gifts, travel, and entertainment, both globally and at the country level;
enhancing controls relating to sponsorships to international medical congresses and Phase IV
studies; and working with outside counsel to conduct an extensive internal investigation of the
Companyâs operations in Greece;

d. the Company and Novartis AG have committed to continuing to enhance
their compliance programs and internal controls, including ensuring that their compliance
programs satisfy the minimum elements set forth in Attachment C to the Agreement (the

âCorporate Compliance Programâ);

e. ased on the Company's and Novartis S remediation and the state o

their compliance programs, and the Companyâs and Novartis AGâs agreement to report to the
Fraud Section and the Office as set forth in the Reporting Requirements, the Fraud Section and the
Office determined that an independent compliance monitor is unnecessary;

f. Novartis AG, the Companyâs parent company, has resolved with the United
States Securities and Exchange Commission (the âSECââ) through a cease-and-desist proceeding
relating to the conduct described in the attached Statement of Facts and other conduct, and has
agreed to pay $92,300,000 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $20,500,000;

g. the nature and seriousness of the offense conduct, as described in the
Statement of Facts, including payments made in connection with the sponsorship of health care
providers (âHCPsâ) employed by public institutions in Greece to attend international congresses
as a means to bribe and corruptly influence the HCPs to increase prescriptions of a Novartis-
branded drug and the falsification of books, records, and accounts to conceal payments related to
improper benefits and things of value and other improper payments to HCPs, as well as the
duration of the misconduct and the involvement of high-level sales and business unit employees
at the Company;

h. Novartis AGâs March 2016 resolution of FCPA accounting allegations
relating to similar conduct in China with the SEC;

1. the Company has agreed to continue to cooperate with the Fraud Section
and the Office in any ongoing investigation as described in Paragraph 5 below;

j. Accordingly, after considering (a) through (1) above, the Company received

full cooperation and remediation credit, but because Novartis AG was involved in similar conduct
Case 2:20-cr-00538-SDW Document 2 Filed 06/25/20 Page 6 of 79 PagelD: 30

for which it reached a resolution with the SEC in March 2016, the 25 percent reduction for
cooperation and remediation was deducted from a point above the midpoint of the applicable
Sentencing Guidelines fine range.
Future Cooperation and Disclosure Requirements

5. The Company shall cooperate fully with the Fraud Section and the Office in any
and all matters relating to the conduct described in this Agreement and the attached Statement of
Facts and other conduct under investigation by the Fraud Section and the Office at any time during
the Term, subject to applicable laws and regulations, until the later of the date upon which all
investigations and prosecutions arising out of such conduct are concluded, or the end of the Term.
At the request of the Fraud Section and the Office, the Company shall also cooperate fully with
other domestic or foreign law enforcement and regulatory authorities and agencies, as well as the
Multilateral Development Banks (the âMDBsâ), in any investigation of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or affiliates, or any of its present or former officers, directors, employees, agents, and
consultants, or any other party, in any and all matters relating to the conduct described in this
Agreement and the attached Statement of Facts and other conduct under investigation by the Fraud
Section and the Office. The Companyâs cooperation pursuant to this Paragraph is subject to
applicable laws and regulations, including relevant data privacy and national security laws, as well
as valid claims of attorney-client privilege or attorney work product doctrine; however, the
Company must provide to the Fraud Section and the Office a log of any information or cooperation
that is not provided based on an assertion of law, regulation, or privilege, and the Company bears
the burden of establishing the validity of any such assertion. The Company agrees that its

cooperation pursuant to this Paragraph shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
a. The Company shall truthfully disclose all factual information with respect

to its activities, those of its subsidiaries and affiliates, and those of its present and former directors,
officers, employees, agents, and consultants, including any evidence or allegations and internal or

Section and the Office may inquire. This obligation of truthful disclosure includes, but is not
limited to, the obligation of the Company to provide to the Fraud Section and the Office, upon
request, any document, record, or other tangible evidence about which the Fraud Section and the
Office may inquire of the Company.

b. Upon request of the Fraud Section and the Office, the Company shall
designate knowledgeable employees, agents, or attorneys to provide to the Fraud Section and the
Office the information and materials described in Paragraph 5(a) above on behalf of the Company.
It is further understood that the Company must at all times provide complete, truthful, and accurate
information.

C. The Company shall use its best efforts to make available for interviews or

to, sworn testimony before a federal grand jury or in federal trials, all meetings requested by the
Fraud Section and the Office, and interviews with domestic or foreign law enforcement and
regulatory authorities. Cooperation under this Paragraph shall include identification of witnesses
who, to the knowledge of the Company, may have material information regarding the matters

being investigated or prosecuted.

d. With respect to any information, testimony, documents, records, or other
tangible evidence provided to the Fraud Section and the Office pursuant to this Agreement, the
Company consents to any and all disclosures, subject to applicable laws and regulations, to other
governmental authorities, including United States authorities and those of a foreign government,
as well as the MDBs, of such materials as the Fraud Section and the Office, in their sole discretion,
shall deem appropriate.

6. In addition to the obligations in Paragraph 5, during the Term, should the Company
learn of any evidence or allegation of conduct that may constitute a violation of the FCPA anti-
bribery or accounting provisions had the conduct occurred within the jurisdiction of the United
States, the Company shall promptly report such evidence or allegation to the Fraud Section and
the Office.

7. The Fraud Section, the Office and the Company agree that application of the
Sentencing Guidelines to determine the applicable fine range yields the following analysis:

a. The November 1, 2018 version of the U.S.S.G. is applicable to this matter.

b. Offense Level. Based upon U.S.S.G. Â§ 2C1.1, the total offense level is 38,

The Company agrees to pay a total monetary penalty in the amount of $225,000,000 (the âTotal

agree that this penalty is appropriate given the facts and circumstances of this case, including the
Relevant Considerations described in Paragraph 4 of this Agreement. The Total Criminal Fine is
final and shall not be refunded. Furthermore, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed an
agreement by the Fraud Section and the Office that the Total Criminal Fine is the maximum penalty

that may be imposed in any future prosecution, and the Fraud Section and the Office are not

9
Case 2:20-cr-00538-SDW Document 2 Filed 06/25/20 Page 10 of 79 PagelD: 34

precluded from arguing in any future prosecution that the Court should impose a higher fine,
although the Fraud Section and the Office agree that under those circumstances, they will
recommend to the Court that any amount paid under this Agreement should be offset against any
fine the Court imposes as part of a future judgment. The Company acknowledges that no tax
deduction may be sought in connection with the payment of any part of the Total Criminal Fine.
The Company shall not seek or accept directly or indirectly reimbursement or indemnification
from any source with regard to the penalty or disgorgement amounts that the Company pays
pursuant to this Agreement or any other agreement entered into with an enforcement authority or
regulator, including the SEC, concerning the facts set forth in the attached Statement of Facts,
except that the Company may seek reimbursement and indemnification from its parent company,
Novartis AG. Novartis AG shall not seek or accept, directly or indirectly, reimbursement or
indemnification from any source with regard to the penalty or disgorgement amounts that Novartis
AG pays, directly or indirectly, including through re1mbursement, to the Company, in association
with this Agreement or any other agreement entered into with an enforcement authority or
regulator, including the SEC, concerning the facts set forth in the attached Statement of Facts.

provided in this Agreement, that they will not bring any criminal or civil case against the Company,

10
Case 2:20-cr-00538-SDW Document 2 Filed 06/25/20 Page 11 of 79 PagelD: 35

Novartis AG, or any of their subsidiaries or affiliates, relating to any of the conduct described in
the Statement of Facts or the Information filed pursuant to this Agreement. The Fraud Section and
the Office, however, may use any information related to the conduct described in the Statement of
Facts against the Company, Novartis AG, or any of their subsidiaries or affiliates: (a) in a
prosecution for perjury or obstruction of justice; (b) in a prosecution for making a false statement;
(c) in a prosecution or other proceeding relating to any crime of violence; or (d) in a prosecution

the Information filed against the Company described in Paragraph 1, and agree not to file charges
in the future against the Company, Novartis AG, or any of their subsidiaries or affiliates based on
the conduct described in this Agreement and the attached Statement of Facts.

Breach of the Agreement

14. If, during the Term: (a) the Company commits any felony under U.S. federal law;
(b) the Company or Novartis AG provides in connection with this Agreement deliberately false,
incomplete, or misleading information, including in connection with its disclosure of information
about individual culpability; (c) the Company fails to cooperate as set forth in Paragraphs 5 and 6
of this Agreement; (d) the Company or Novartis AG fails to implement a compliance program as
set forth in Paragraphs 9 and 10 of this Agreement and Attachment C; (e) the Company commits
any act that, had it occurred within the jurisdictional reach of the FCPA, would be a violation of

of the Companyâs and Novartis AGâs obligations under the Agreement, regardless of whether the
Fraud Section and the Office become aware of such a breach after the Term is complete, the
Company, Novartis AG, and their subsidiaries and affiliates, shall thereafter be subject to
prosecution for any federal criminal violation of which the Fraud Section and the Office have

knowledge, including, but not limited to, the charges in the Information described in Paragraph 1,

which may be pursued by the Fraud Section and the Office in the United States District Court for
the District of New Jersey or any other appropriate venue. Determination of whether the Company
or Novartis AG has breached the Agreement and whether to pursue prosecution of the Company,
Novartis AG, or their subsidiaries or affiliates, shall be in the Fraud Sectionâs and the Officeâs sole
discretion. Any such prosecution may be premised on information provided by the Company,
Novartis AG, their subsidiaries or affiliates, or their personnel. Any such prosecution relating to
the conduct described in the Statement of Facts or relating to conduct known to the Fraud Section
and the Office prior to the date on which this Agreement was signed that is not time-barred by the
applicable statute of limitations on the date of the signing of this Agreement may be commenced
against the Company, Novartis AG, or their subsidiaries or affiliates, notwithstanding the

of the Term plus one year. Thus, by signing this Agreement, the Company and Novartis AG agree
that the statute of limitations with respect to any such prosecution that is not time-barred on the
date of the signing of this Agreement shall be tolled for the Term plus one year. In addition, the
Company agrees that the statute of limitations as to any violation of federal law that occurs during
the Term will be tolled from the date upon which the violation occurs until the earlier of the date
upon which the Fraud Section and the Office are made aware of the violation or the duration of
the Term plus five years, and that this period shall be excluded from any calculation of time for
purposes of the application of the statute of limitations.

15. In the event the Fraud Section and the Office determine that the Company or
Novartis AG has breached this Agreement, the Fraud Section and the Office agree to provide the

Company and Novartis AG with written notice of such breach prior to instituting any prosecution

resulting from such breach. Within thirty days of receipt of such notice, the Company and Novartis
AG shall have the opportunity to respond to the Fraud Section and the Office in writing to explain
the nature and circumstances of such breach, as well as the actions the Company and Novartis AG
have taken to address and remediate the situation, which explanation the Fraud Section and the
Office shall consider in determining whether to pursue prosecution of the Company, Novartis AG,
or their subsidiaries or affiliates.

16. In the event the Fraud Section and the Office determine that the Company or
Novartis AG has breached this Agreement: (a) all statements made by or on behalf of the Company
Novartis AG, or their subsidiaries or affiliates to the Fraud Section and the Office or to the Court,
including the attached Statement of Facts, and any testimony given by the Company, Novartis AG,
or their subsidiaries or affiliates before a grand jury, a court, or any tribunal, or at any legislative
hearings, whether prior or subsequent to this Agreement, and any leads derived from such
statements or testimony, shall be admissible in evidence in any and all criminal proceedings
brought by the Fraud Section and the Office against the Company, Novartis AG, or their
subsidiaries or affiliates; and (b) the Company, Novartis AG, or their subsidiaries or affiliates shall
not assert any claim under the United States Constitution, Rule 11(f) of the Federal Rules of
Criminal Procedure, Rule 410 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, or any other federal rule that any
such statements or testimony made by or on behalf of the Company, Novartis AG, or their
subsidiaries or affiliates prior or subsequent to this Agreement, or any leads derived therefrom,
should be suppressed or are otherwise inadmissible. The decision whether conduct or statements
of any current director, officer, or employee, or any person acting on behalf of, or at the direction

of, the Company, Novartis AG, or their subsidiaries or affiliates will be imputed to the Company

15
Case 2:20-cr-00538-SDW Document 2 Filed 06/25/20 Page 16 of 79 PagelD: 40

or Novartis AG for the purpose of determining whether the Company or Novartis AG has violated
any provision of this Agreement shall be in the sole discretion of the Fraud Section and the Office.

17. The Company and Novartis AG acknowledge that the Fraud Section and the Office
have made no representations, assurances, or promises concerning what sentence may be imposed
by the Court if the Company or Novartis AG breaches this Agreement and this matter proceeds to
judgment. The Company and Novartis AG further acknowledge that any such sentence is solely
within the discretion of the Court and that nothing in this Agreement binds or restricts the Court
in the exercise of such discretion.

18. On the date that the period of deferred prosecution specified in this Agreement
expires, the Company, by the Chief Executive Officer of the Company and the Chief Financial
Officer of the Company, will certify to the Fraud Section and the Office that the Company has met
its disclosure obligations pursuant to Paragraphs 5 and 6 of this Agreement. Each certification
will be deemed a material statement and representation by the Company to the executive branch
of the United States for purposes of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 1001 and 1519, and it
will be deemed to have been made in the judicial district in which this Agreement is filed.

Sale, Merger, or Other Change in Corporate Form of the Company

19. Except as may otherwise be agreed by the parties in connection with a particular
transaction, the Company and Novartis AG agree that in the event that, during the Term, the
Company or Novartis AG undertake any change in corporate form, including if it sells, merges, or
transfers business operations that are material to the Companyâs or Novartis AGâs consolidated
operations, or to the operations of any subsidiaries or affiliates involved in the conduct described

in the attached Statement of Facts, as they exist as of the date of this Agreement, whether such

change is structured as a sale, asset sale, merger, transfer, or other change in corporate form, it
shall include in any contract for sale, merger, transfer, or other change in corporate form a
provision binding the purchaser, or any successor in interest thereto, to the obligations described
in this Agreement. The purchaser or successor in interest must also agree in writing that the Fraud
Sectionâs and the Officeâs ability to declare a breach under this Agreement is applicable in full
force to that entity. The Company and Novartis AG agree that the failure to include these
provisions in the transaction will make any such transaction null and void. The Company and
Novartis AG shall provide notice to the Fraud Section and the Office at least thirty days prior to
undertaking any such sale, merger, transfer, or other change in corporate form. The Fraud Section
and the Office shall notify the Company and Novartis AG prior to such transaction (or series of
transactions) if they determine that the transaction(s) will have the effect of circumventing or
frustrating the enforcement purposes of this Agreement. At any time during the Term the
Company or Novartis AG engages in a transaction(s) that has the effect of circumventing or
frustrating the enforcement purposes of this Agreement, the Fraud Section and the Office may
deem it a breach of this Agreement pursuant to Paragraphs 14 to 18 of this Agreement. Nothing
herein shall restrict the Company or Novartis AG from indemnifying (or otherwise holding
harmless) the purchaser or successor in interest for penalties or other costs arising from any
conduct that may have occurred prior to the date of the transaction, so long as such indemnification
does not have the effect of circumventing or frustrating the enforcement purposes of this

Agreement, as determined by the Fraud Section and the Office.

Public Statements by the Company and Novartis AG

20. The Company and Novartis AG expressly agree that they shall not, through present
or future attorneys, officers, directors, employees, agents or any other person authorized to speak
for the Company or Novartis AG, make any public statement, in litigation or otherwise,
contradicting the acceptance of responsibility by the Company or Novartis AG set forth above or
the facts described in the attached Statement of Facts. Any such contradictory statement shall,
subject to cure rights of the Company and Novartis AG described below, constitute a breach of
this Agreement, and the Company and/or Novartis AG thereafter shall be subject to prosecution
as set forth in Paragraphs 14 to 16 of this Agreement. The decision whether any public statement

ATTACHMENT A
STATEMENT OF FACTS

The following Statement of Facts is incorporated as part of the Deferred Prosecution
Agreement (the âAgreementâ) between the United States Department of Justice, Criminal
Division, Fraud Section (the âFraud Sectionâ), the United States Attorneyâs Office for the District
of New Jersey (the âOfficeâ), and Novartis Hellas S.A.C.I. (âNovartis Hellasâ or the âCompanyâ).
The Company agrees and stipulates that the following facts and conclusions of U.S. law are true
and accurate. The Company admits, accepts, and acknowledges that it is responsible for the acts
of its officers, directors, employees, and agents as set forth below. Should the Fraud Section and
the Office pursue the prosecution that is deferred by this Agreement, the Company agrees that it
will neither contest the admissibility of, nor contradict, this Statement of Facts in any such
proceeding. The following facts took place during the relevant time period and establish beyond
a reasonable doubt the charges set forth in the Information attached to this Agreement:

Relevant Entities and Individuals

1. The Company was a Greek corporation headquartered in Athens, Greece and a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Novartis AG, a global pharmaceutical company based in Basel,
Switzerland. Among other lines of business, the Company sold and marketed Novartis-branded
prescription drugs in Greece. Novartis AGâs American Depository Shares were listed and traded
on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol âNVS.â Novartis AG was an issuer of publicly
traded securities registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and was
required to file periodic reports with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the

âSECâ) under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act. Thus, Novartis AG was an âissuerâ

A-1
Case 2:20-cr-00538-SDW Document 2 Filed 06/25/20 Page 30 of 79 PagelD: 54

within the meaning of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (âFCPAâ), 15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78dd-1(a) and
78m(b). The Companyâs books, records, and accounts were included in the consolidated financial
statements of Novartis AG filed with the SEC.

2. âNovartis Hellas Employee 1,â an individual whose identity is known to the Fraud
Section and the Office, was a manager at the Company between in or about January 2011 and in
or about 2015.

3. âNovartis Hellas Employee 2,â an individual whose identity is known to the Fraud
Section and the Office, held various positions at the Company between in or about 2012 and in or
about 2015.

The Greek Health Care System, Greek Entities, and Foreign Officials

4, Greece owned and operated state-owned and state-controlled hospitals and clinics,
and these hospitals and clinics performed a state function. Individuals employed by these hospitals
and clinics were âforeign officialsâ within the meaning of the FCPA, 15 U.S.C. Â§ 78dd-3(f)(2)(A).

5. âGreek State-Owned Clinic,â an entity whose identity is known to the Fraud
Section and the Office, was a state-owned and state-controlled medical clinic located in Athens,
Greece that performed functions that Greece treated as its own, and thus was an instrumentality
within the meaning of the FCPA, 15 U.S.C. Â§ 78dd-3(f)(2)(A).

6. âGreek HCP 1,â an individual whose identity is known to the Fraud Section and
the Office, was a health care provider (âHCPâ), an employee of Greek State-Owned Clinic, and a

âforeign officialâ within the meaning of the FCPA, 15 U.S.C. Â§ 78dd-3(f)(2)(A).

Overview of the Unlawful Schemes

7. During the relevant time periods set forth below, the Company, through its
employees and agents, knowingly and willfully conspired and agreed to corruptly provide
improper benefits and things of value to employees of state-owned and state-controlled hospitals
and clinics in Greece (âGreek State HCPsâ) and other HCPs in Greece with the intent to obtain an
improper advantage and to increase sales of a certain Novartis-branded prescription drug in
Greece. Specifically, the Company sponsored Greek State HCPs to attend international congresses
as a means to bribe and corruptly influence the HCPs to increase prescriptions of Lucentis.!

8. During the relevant time periods set forth below, the Company, through its
employees and agents, also knowingly and willfully conspired and agreed to cause certain
payments to be falsely recorded in Novartis AGâs books, records, and accounts. Specifically, the
Company falsely recorded as legitimate advertising and promotion expenses: (a) corrupt payments
related to the international congresses described above; and (b) improper payments to HCPs related
to an epidemiological study intended to increase sales of certain Novartis-branded prescription
drugs. These records were consolidated into Novartis AGâs financial records and used to support
Novartis AGâs financial reporting to the SEC. As such, the Company, through its employees and
agents, caused these payments to be falsely recorded in Novartis AGâs books, records, and

accounts.

 

 Lucentis was a prescription drug sold by the Company in Greece that is approved for several
indications, including to treat adults with neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration.

A-3
Case 2:20-cr-00538-SDW Document 2 Filed 06/25/20 Page 32 of 79 PagelD: 56

9. During this time period, the Company recognized at least $71.48 USD million in
profits, as calculated for the purposes of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines, from sales of Lucentis in
Greece and from sales of Novartis-branded prescription drugs related to the epidemiological study.

Details of the International Medical Congress Scheme

10. Between in or about 2012 and in or about 2015, the Company paid for public and
private ophthalmologists in Greece to attend international âmedical congresses.â These congresses
were organized by various medical associations in the United States and Europe, and typically
took place over several days in a destination city in the United States or Europe.

11. By sponsoring Greek State HCPs to attend congresses, the Company paid for the
costs associated with that Greek State HCPâs attendance, such as airfare, hotel accommodations,
and congress registration fees. The Company typically paid for travel costs associated with
congresses through third-party travel agencies. For each individual Greek State HCP, the total
cost to the Company for attendance of an international congress often exceeded $6,000 USD.

12. The Companyâs policies stated that the purpose for sending HCPs to congresses
was to provide scientific or educational information. In reality, however, sales employees at the
Company, including Novartis Hellas Employee 1, sometimes used international congresses to
improperly influence and induce Greek State HCPs to increase prescriptions for Lucentis.

13. As part of the scheme, the Company maintained internal documentation noting that
HCPs with the highest potential and highest propensity to prescribe Lucentis would receive
âinvestments,â such as sponsorships to attend international congresses, while HCPs with lower

potential and less propensity to prescribe Lucentis would receive no such âinvestments.â

14. The use of congresses as a means to improperly influence and induce Greek State

HCPs to prescribe Lucentis was discussed and documented at the Company. For example, on or
about September 27, 2012, the Companyâs Lucentis Brand Team held a meeting to discuss the
sales strategy for Greek State HCPs. Among other attendees, Novartis Hellas Employee | and
Novartis Hellas Employee 2 participated in the meeting. In the written minutes from this meeting
(the âMinutesâ), a section entitled âIncrease Pressure in [sic] HCPsâ reflected the Companyâs
intent to use specific international congress sponsorships to corruptly influence Greek State HCPs.
In particular, the Minutes stated that Greek State HCPs âmust understand that their participation
in [specific congresses in the United States and Europe] will be cancelled if sales performance is
not improved significantly.â

15. The Minutes further explained that the Companyâs message that it would withdraw
its international congress sponsorships based on poor Lucentis sales performance âmust also be
discussed with [sales] REPs in the next Sales team [meeting]. REPs must make clear to their
[HCP] customers that Lucentis is facing real difficulties in the market and for this reason there will
be serious consequences.â

16. The Minutes referred to a certain U.S.-based ophthalmology association that
organized a congress in the U.S. (the âU.S. Academyâ). Sales employees in the Companyâs
ophthalmology business unit sent selected HCPs, including Greek State HCPs, to the U.S.
Academyâs congress, and employees of the Company traveled to the United States and, while
located in the United States, facilitated the attendance of the Greek State HCPs at the U.S.

Academyâs congress, as a method to corruptly influence the HCPs.
17. In or around January 2013, Novartis Hellas Employee 1 prepared a presentation

entitled âAction Plan KOLsâ which detailed the various means through which Novartis Hellas
Employee 1 and others at the Company intended to target various âTop KOLs,â or Key Opinion
Leaders, in ophthalmology (the âAction Plansâ).

18. One such Action Plan targeted Greek HCP 1, who worked at the Greek State-
Owned Clinic. The Action Plan set forth how Novartis Hellas Employee 1 and others at the
Company intended to use certain âactionsââincluding sponsorship to U.S. congressesâto induce
Greek HCP | to prescribe Lucentis. The âTargetâ was to âincreaseâ Greek HCP 1âs âloyaltyâ to
the Company and âchan[ge] [HCP 1âs] mindset about cooperation.â As described in the Action
Planâs âStrategy-Actionsâ section, Novartis Hellas Employee | and others at the Company sought
to achieve this objective through, among other âactions,â âtak[ing] advantage of [the U.S.
Academyâs]| congresses.â

19. The Action Plan further stated that Novartis Hellas Employee | and others at the
Company should convey the following message to Greek HCP 1: âto get you must write. No
presents anymore.â

20. The Action Plan indicated that Novartis Hellas Employee 1 would âASK HIM
ALL,â meaning that the goal was to capture 100% of Greek HCP 1âs ophthalmology prescriptions
for which Lucentis could be prescribed.

21. In or about late 2013, employees of the Company traveled to the United States and,
while located in the United States, facilitated the attendance of Greek HCP | and others at the U.S.

Academyâs congress in New Orleans, Louisiana.

22. In addition to Greek HCP 1, an Action Plan written by Novartis Hellas Employee
1 stated that the Companyâs ophthalmology business unit would â[l]ower investment [in another
Greek State HCP] as a penalty for [Lucentis injection] lossâ while making their âmotive (large
investment)â visible to the HCP. To generate increased Lucentis prescriptions from one particular
Greek State HCP, another Action Plan written by Novartis Hellas Employee 1 stated that the
âImplementation Planâ consisted of specific European congresses and the U.S. Academyâs
congress along with a reference to â5500 grand [sic] for congress.â

23. In or about 2013, certain employees in the Companyâs ophthalmology business unit
developed a plan that outlined the various âactivitiesâ they intended to use to influence HCPs at a
public hospitalâs ophthalmology clinic (the âGreek Hospital Clinicâ). These activities included
âParticipation in Congress (4x INTL, 10x National).â

24. In or about 2014, Novartis Hellas Employee | and another manager at the Company
wrote a basketball-themed written presentation for the Companyâs Lucentis brand team (the
Presentationâ). The Presentation addressed how the Companyâs Lucentis brand team should
approach Greek State HCPs who preferred a competitor companyâs product and who raised certain
âdefensesâ against using Lucentis. Among other âdefenses,â these HCPs indicated that the
competitor companyâs products were the preferred choice to treat age-related macular
degeneration and were less expensive. The Presentation described how the Company intended to
overcome these âdefensesâ through the use of improper inducements to âconvertâ Greek State
HCPs to prescribing Lucentis.

25. One âdefense,â which was described against the backdrop of an image of a world

famous basketball playerâs face on a dollar bill, stated (as translated): â[the competitor company |

A-7
Case 2:20-cr-00538-SDW Document 2 Filed 06/25/20 Page 36 of 79 PagelD: 60

has a large budget to invest âthey told me, whatever you want.ââ The competitor companyâs
strategy, as indicted in the Presentation, included sending Greek State HCPs to U.S. congresses.

26. The Presentation further explained how the Company sought to âdissolveâ this
âdefenseâ through, among other things, sending targeted Greek State HCPs to ophthalmology
congresses in Europe and the United States. This included sending ten HCPs to the U.S.
Academyâs congress at a cost of 67,000 euros (equivalent to then approximately $89,000 USD).

27. The Company, through its employees and agents, falsely recorded the corrupt
payments associated with congress sponsorships as legitimate advertising and promotion expenses
in the Companyâs internal accounting records. By recording these payments as advertising and
promotion expenses, the Company concealed their true and corrupt nature. These false records
were consolidated into Novartis AGâs financial records and used to support Novartis AGâs
financial reporting to the SEC. As such, the Company, through its employees and agents,
knowingly and willfully conspired and agreed with others to cause the corrupt payments to be
falsely recorded as legitimate expenses in Novartis AGâs books, records, and accounts.

Details of the Clinical Trial Scheme

Background on Clinical Trials at the Company

28. | The Company was not responsible for Phase I, II, or III clinical trials, which relate
to different phases of the process leading from a drugâs discovery to government approval.
However, the Company sponsored post-approval clinical trials, known as Phase IV studies and
epidemiological studies, both of which were research studies intended to answer scientific

questions related to medical conditions treated by Novartis-branded prescription drugs. In this

role, and depending on the study, the Company selected Greek public and private HCPs to gather
patient data for the studies.

29. Phase IV studies and epidemiological studies were designed to inform medical and
clinical decisions, not to increase sales. As set forth below, however, the Company made improper
payments to HCPs related to an epidemiological study intended to increase sales of certain
Novartis-branded prescription drugs.

The EXACTLY Study

30. In or about 2008, employees of the Company responsible for marketing Novartis-
branded hypertension prescription drugs developed a marketing project named âEXACTLY.â The
brand managers prepared a written âProject Summaryâ for EXACTLY dated November 19, 2008
(the âProject Summaryâ). According to the Project Summary, the Company planned to provide
HCPs with free blood pressure manometers and the HCPs would provide the Company with
information related to their patients, including uncontrolled or newly diagnosed patients with
hypertension. Through EXACTLY, the Company sought to increase sales of Novartis-branded
hypertension prescription drugs.

31. The Project Summary described including over 2,200 HCPs who, in turn, treated
over 44,000 patients. With an anticipated return on investment (âROIâ) of 3.04, the planned
investment of over 2.8 million euros (equivalent to then approximately $3.8 million USD) in
payments to HCPs through EXACTLY was expected to yield sales of over 8.6 million euros (the
equivalent to then approximately $11.9 million USD). This projected ROI, the Project Summary

explained, included over 16,000 ânewly diagnosed or uncontrolled patients.â

32. On or about November 19, 2008, the Project Summary for EXACTLY was
submitted to the Companyâs Country Compliance Board (âCCBâ) for internal approval. As
reflected in the CCBâs Program Review Meeting Minutes from on or about November 19, 2008,
the CCB deemed EXACTLY to be âof high value,â but decided that all or part of the project should
be converted to a âScientific Investigation.â The CCB made this decision, in part, because
EXACTLY involved collecting patient data and would thus require approval from the Greek
governmentâs National Organization for Medicines (Ethnikos Organismos Farmakon) (the âGreek
EOFâ).

33. The Company accordingly redesigned a portion of EXACTLY as an
epidemiological investigational study designed âto evaluate the percentage of uncontrolled
hypertensive patientsâ in Greece. Instead of providing free manometers to HCPs, the
investigational study version of EXACTLY entailed the Company paying participating HCPs
directly. Participating HCPs were responsible for gathering patient data and completing case
report forms to record data for each enrolled patient.

34. In or about February 2009, the Greek EOF approved EXACTLY as an
investigational study.

35. From in or about April 2009 through in or about December 2009, the Company and
HCPs conducted the EXACTLY study which was designed to target over 2,200 HCPs and over
44.000 patients.

36. Ultimately, the Company, through its employees and agents, made improper

payments to HCPs.

A-10
37. Many of the forms that were submitted contained mistakes and inconsistencies,

including forms that failed to indicate whether the patient suffered from coronary disease, which
is strongly linked to hypertension â the core purported focus of EXACTLY.

38. |The Companyâs employees also recognized that many HCPs believed that they
were paid in exchange for writing prescriptions for Novartis-branded hypertension prescription
drugs and not for providing data as part of a clinical study. Specifically, on or about April 15,
2010, the Company held an internal meeting for brand managers and other personnel involved
with EXACTLY âto summarize the learnings and identify next stepsâ (the âEXACTLY Debriefâ).
During the EXACTLY Debrief, which the Company audio recorded, regarding payments that
HCPs received related to EXACTLY, a number of employees and managers acknowledged the
following:

e A Company manager stated that (as translated): â[A]lthough the microphone is

recording .. . you all know this very well, I just repeat, that the doctor believes that
he/she participates in a study [EXACTLY] and gets paid for what he prescribes in

reality and not for what he/she writes in the study. . . Consequently, the doctorâs
impression was that they participate just so that they get paid for what they prescribe.â

e A Company sales manager stated (as translated): â[T]he main issue is . . . that the
doctors believe that the study was conducted in order to get paid for what they write,
right?â

e A Company medical manager stated (as translated) that a clinical study âis a part of the
marketing mix; we do not disagree that this is a type of benefit provided to the doctors.
They know that they will get paid, this 1s what happens in reality.â

e A Company brand manager stated that (as translated): âTo be honest, the studies were
conducted in a similar way in the past as well; they were conducted as marketing
projects. Thatâs within quotation marks. Between us.â

39. The Company, through its employees and agents, falsely recorded these payments

related to EXACTLY as advertising and promotion expenses in the Companyâs internal accounting

records. By doing so, the Company concealed their true and improper nature. These false records
were consolidated into Novartis AGâs financial records and were used to support Novartis AGâs
financial reporting to the SEC. As such, the Company, through its employees and agents,
knowingly and willfully conspired and agreed with others to cause the payments related to
EXACTLY to be falsely recorded as legitimate expenses in Novartis AGâs books, records, and

accounts.

ATTACHMENT D

REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
Novartis AG agrees that it will report to the Fraud Section and the Office periodically, at
no less than twelve-month intervals during a three-year term, regarding remediation and
implementation of the compliance program and internal controls, policies, and procedures
described in Attachment C. During this three-year period, Novartis AG shall: (1) conduct an initial
review and submit an initial report, and (2) conduct and prepare at least two follow-up reviews and
reports, as described below:
a. By no later than one year from the date this Agreement is executed, Novartis
AG shall submit to the Fraud Section and the Office a written report setting forth a complete
description of its remediation efforts to date, its proposals reasonably designed to improve Novartis
AGâs internal controls, policies, and procedures for ensuring compliance with the FCPA and other
applicable anti-corruption laws, and the proposed scope of the subsequent reviews. The report
shall be transmitted to Chief, FCPA Unit, Fraud Section, Criminal Division, U.S. Department of
Justice, 1400 New York Avenue, NW, Bond Building, 11th Floor, Washington, D.C. 20530 and
Chief, Health Care Fraud Unit, United States Attorneyâs Office for the District of New Jersey, 970
Broad Street, 7th Floor, Newark, New Jersey 07102. Novartis AG may extend the time period for
issuance of the report with prior written approval of the Fraud Section and the Office.
b. Novartis AG shall undertake at least two follow-up reviews and reports,
incorporating the Fraud Sectionâs and the Officeâs views on Novartis AGâs prior reviews and

reports, to further monitor and assess whether Novartis AGâs policies and procedures are

reasonably designed to detect and prevent violations of the FCPA and other applicable anti-
corruption laws.

C. The first follow-up review and report shall be completed by no later than
one year after the initial report is submitted to the Fraud Section and the Office. The second
follow-up review and report shall be completed and delivered to the Fraud Section and the Office
no later than thirty days before the end of the Term.

d. The reports will likely include proprietary, financial, confidential, and
competitive business information. Moreover, public disclosure of the reports could discourage
cooperation, impede pending or potential government investigations and thus undermine the
objectives of the reporting requirement. For these reasons, among others, the reports and the
contents thereof are intended to remain and shall remain non-public, except as otherwise agreed to
by the parties in writing, or except to the extent that the Fraud Section and the Office determine in
their sole discretion that disclosure would be in furtherance of the Fraud Sectionâs and the Officeâs
discharge of their duties and responsibilities or is otherwise required by law.

e. Novartis AG may extend the time period for submission of any of the follow-

up reports with prior written approval of the Fraud Section and the Office.

GENERAL ALLEGATIONS
Relevant Statutory Background

1. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, 15
U'S.C. Â§Â§ 78dd-1, et seq. (the âFCPAâ), was enacted by Congress for the purpose
of, among other things, making it unlawful to act corruptly in furtherance of an
offer, promise, authorization, or payment of money or anything of value, directly
or indirectly, to a foreign official for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business
for, or directing business to, any person. In addition, the FCPAâs accounting
provisions, among other things, require every issuer of publicly traded securities
registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15
US.C. Â§ 781, or required to file periodic reports with the United States Securities
and Exchange Commission (âSECâ) under Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange
Act, 15 U.S.C Â§ 780(d), to make and keep books, records, and accounts that

accurately and fairly reflect transactions and the distribution of the companyâs
Case 2:20-cr-00538-SDW Document 2 Filed 06/25/20 Page 57 of 79 PagelD: 81

assets, and prohibit the knowing and willful falsification of an issuerâs books,
records, or accounts. 15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78m(b)(2)(A), 78m(b)(5), and 78ff(a).

NOVARTIS HELLAS and Other Relevant Entities and Individuals

 

2. Defendant Novartis Hellas $.A.C.I. (âNOVARTIS HELLASâ)
was a Greek corporation headquartered in Athens, Greece and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Novartis AG, a global pharmaceutical company based in Basel,
Switzerland. Among other lines of business, NOVARTIS HELLAS sold and
marketed Novartis-branded prescription drugs in Greece. Novartis AGâs
American Depository Shares were listed and traded on the New York Stock
Exchange under the symbol âNVS.â Novartis AG was an issuer of publicly traded
securities registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and
was required to file periodic reports with the SEC under Section 13 of the
Securities Exchange Act. Thus, Novartis AG was an âissuerâ within the meaning
of the FCPA, 15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78dd-1(a) and 78m(b). NOVARTIS HELLASâs books,
records, and accounts were included in the consolidated financial statements of
Novartis AG filed with the SEC.

3. âNovartis Hellas Employee 1,â an individual whose identity is
known to the United States, was a manager at NOVARTIS HELLAS between in
or about January 2011 and in or about 2015.

4. âNovartis Hellas Employee 2,â an individual whose identity is
known to the United States, held various positions at NOVARTIS HELLAS

between in or about 2012 and in or about 2015.

The Greek Health Care System, Greek Entities, and Foreign Officials

 

5. Greece owned and operated state-owned and state-controlled
hospitals and clinics, and these hospitals and clinics performed a state function.
Individuals employed by these hospitals and clinics were âforeign officialsâ within
the meaning of the FCPA, 15 U.S.C. Â§ 78dd-3(f)(2)(A).

6. âGreek State-Owned Clinic,â an entity whose identity is
known to the United States, was a state-owned and state-controlled medical clinic
located in Athens, Greece that performed functions that Greece treated as its own,
and thus was an instrumentality within the meaning of the FCPA, 15 U.S.C. Â§
78dd-3(f)(2)(A).

7. âGreek HCP 1,â an individual whose identity is known to the
United States, was a health care provider (âHCPâ), an employee of Greek State-
Owned Clinic, and a âforeign officialâ within the meaning of the FCPA, 15 U.S.C.
Â§ 78dd-3(f)(2)(A).

Overview of the Unlawful Schemes

 

8. During the relevant time periods set forth below, NOVARTIS
HELLAS, through its employees and agents, knowingly and willfully conspired
and agreed to corruptly provide improper benefits and things of value to
employees of state-owned and state-controlled hospitals and clinics in Greece
(âGreek State HCPsâ) and other HCPs in Greece with the intent to obtain an
improper advantage and to increase sales of a certain Novartis-branded

prescription drug in Greece. Specifically, NOVARTIS HELLAS sponsored Greek
3
Case 2:20-cr-00538-SDW Document 2 Filed 06/25/20 Page 59 of 79 PagelD: 83

State HCPs to attend international congresses as a means to bribe and corruptly
influence the HCPs to increase prescriptions of Lucentis.!

9. During the relevant time periods set forth below, NOVARTIS
HELLAS, through its employees and agents, also knowingly and willfully
conspired and agreed to cause certain payments to be falsely recorded in Novartis
AGâs books, records, and accounts. Specifically, NOVARTIS HELLAS falsely
recorded as legitimate advertising and promotion expenses: (a) corrupt payments
related to the international congresses described above; and (b) improper
payments to HCPs related to an epidemiological study intended to increase sales
of certain Novartis-branded prescription drugs. These records were consolidated
into Novartis AGâs financial records and used to support Novartis AGâs financial
reporting to the SEC. As such, NOVARTIS HELLAS, through its employees and
agents, caused these payments to be falsely recorded in Novartis AGâs books,
records, and accounts.

10. During this time period, NOVARTIS HELLAS recognized at
least $71.48 million in profits, as calculated for the purposes of the U.S.
Sentencing Guidelines, from sales of Lucentis in Greece and from sales of

Novartis-branded prescription drugs related to the epidemiological study.

 

1 Lucentis was a prescription drug sold by NOVARTIS HELLAS in Greece that
is approved for several indications, including to treat adults with neovascular
(wet) age-related macular degeneration.

Details of the International Medical Congress Scheme

 

11. Between in or about 2012 and in or about 2015, NOVARTIS
HELLAS paid for public and private ophthalmologists in Greece to attend

9?

international âmedical congresses.â These congresses were organized by various
medical associations in the United States and Europe, and typically took place
over several days in a destination city in the United States or Europe.

12. By sponsoring Greek State HCPs to attend congresses,
NOVARTIS HELLAS paid for the costs associated with that Greek State HCPâs
attendance, such as airfare, hotel accommodations, and congress registration fees.
NOVARTIS HELLAS typically paid for travel costs associated with congresses
through third-party travel agencies. For each individual Greek State HCP, the
total cost to NOVARTIS HELLAS for attendance of an international congress
often exceeded $6,000.

13. NOVARTIS HELLASâs policies stated that the purpose for
sending HCPs to congresses was to provide scientific or educational information.
In reality, however, sales employees at NOVARTIS HELLAS, including Novartis
Hellas Employee 1, sometimes used international congresses to improperly
influence and induce Greek State HCPs to increase prescriptions for Lucentis.

14. As part of the scheme, NOVARTIS HELLAS maintained

internal documentation noting that HCPs with the highest potential and highest

propensity to prescribe Lucentis would receive âinvestments,â such as

oe,
re
Neg

sponsorships to attend international congresses, while HCPs with lower potential
and less propensity to prescribe Lucentis would receive no such âinvestments.â

15. The use of congresses as a means to improperly influence and
induce Greek State HCPs to prescribe Lucentis was discussed and documented at
NOVARTIS HELLAS. For example, on or about September 27, 2012, NOVARTIS
HELLASâs Lucentis Brand Team held a meeting to discuss the sales strategy for
Greek State HCPs. Among other attendees, Novartis Hellas Employee 1 and
Novartis Hellas Employee 2 participated in the meeting. In the written minutes
from this meeting (the âMinutesâ), a section entitled âIncrease Pressure in [sic]
HCPsâ reflected NOVARTIS HELLASâs intent to use specific international
congress sponsorships to corruptly influence Greek State HCPs. In particular, the
Minutes stated that Greek State HCPs âmust understand that their participation
in [specific congresses in the United States and Europe] will be cancelled if sales
performance is not improved significantly.â

16. The Minutes further explained that NOVARTIS HELLASâs
message that it would withdraw its international congress sponsorships based on
poor Lucentis sales performance âmust also be discussed with [sales] REPs in the
next Sales team [meeting]. REPs must make clear to their [HCP] customers that
Lucentis is facing real difficulties in the market and for this reason there will be
serious consequences.â

17. The Minutes referred to a certain U.S.-based ophthalmology

association that organized a congress in the United States (the âU.S. Academyâ).

Sales employees in NOVARTIS HELLASâs ophthalmology business unit sent
selected HCPs, including Greek State HCPs, to the U.S. Academyâs congress, and
employees of NOVARTIS HELLAS traveled to the United States and, while
located in the United States, facilitated the attendance of the Greek State HCPs
at the U.S. Academyâs congress as a method to corruptly influence the HCPs.

18. In or about January 2013, Novartis Hellas Employee 1
prepared a presentation entitled âAction Plan KOLsâ which detailed the various
means through which Novartis Hellas Employee 1 and others at NOVARTIS
HELLAS intended to target various âTop KOLs,â or Key Opinion Leaders, in
ophthalmology (the âAction Plansâ).

19. One such Action Plan targeted Greek HCP 1, who worked at
the Greek State-Owned Clinic. The Action Plan set forth how Novartis Hellas
Employee 1 and others at NOVARTIS HELLAS intended to use certain
âactionsââincluding sponsorship to U.S. congressesâto induce Greek HCP 1 to
prescribe Lucentis. The âTargetâ was to âincreaseâ Greek HCP 1âs âloyaltyâ to
NOVARTIS HELLAS and âchan[ge] [HCP 1âs] mindset about cooperation.â As
described in the Action Planâs âStrategy-Actionsâ section, Novartis Hellas
Employee 1 and others at NOVARTIS HELLAS sought to achieve this objective
through, among other âactions,â âtak[ing] advantage of [the U.S. Academyâs]

congresses.â

20. The Action Plan further stated that Novartis Hellas Employee
1 and others at NOVARTIS HELLAS should convey the following message to
Greek HCP 1: âto get you must write. No presents anymore.â

21. The Action Plan indicated that Novartis Hellas Employee 1
would âASK HIM ALL,â meaning that the goal was to capture 100% of Greek HCP
1âs ophthalmology prescriptions for which Lucentis could be prescribed.

22. In or about late 2013, employees of NOVARTIS HELLAS
traveled to the United States and, while located in the United States, facilitated
the attendance of Greek HCP 1 and others at the U.S. Academyâs congress in New
Orleans, Louisiana.

23. In addition to Greek HCP 1, an Action Plan written by
Novartis Hellas Employee 1 stated that NOVARTIS HELLASâs ophthalmology
business unit would â[l]ower investment [in another Greek State HCP] as a
penalty for [Lucentis injection] lossâ while making their âmotive (arge
investment)â visible to the HCP. To generate increased Lucentis prescriptions
from one particular Greek State HCP, another Action Plan written by Novartis
Hellas Employee 1 stated that the âImplementation Planâ consisted of specific
European congresses and the U.S. Academyâs congress along with a reference to
â5500 grand [sic] for congress.â

24. Inor about 2013, certain employees in NOVARTIS HELLASâs
ophthalmology business unit developed a plan that outlined the various

âactivitiesâ that they intended to use to influence HCPs at a public hospitalâs

a

ophthalmology clinic (the âGreek Hospital Clinicâ). These activities included
âParticipation in Congress (4x INTL, 10x National).â

25. In or about 2014, Novartis Hellas Employee 1 and another
manager at NOVARTIS HELLAS wrote a basketball-themed written presentation
for NOVARTIS HELLASâs Lucentis brand team (the âPresentationâ). The
Presentation addressed how NOVARTIS HELLASâs Lucentis brand team should
approach Greek State HCPs who preferred a competitor companyâs product and
who raised certain âdefensesâ against using Lucentis. Among other âdefenses,â
these HCPs indicated that the competitor companyâs products were the preferred
choice to treat age-related macular degeneration and were less expensive. The
Presentation described how NOVARTIS HELLAS intended to overcome these
âdefensesâ through the use of improper inducements to âconvertâ Greek State
HCPs to prescribing Lucentis.

26. One âdefense,â which was described against the backdrop of an
image of a world famous basketball playerâs face on a dollar bill, stated (as
translated): â[the competitor company] has a large budget to invest âthey told me,

99?

whatever you want.â The competitor companyâs strategy, as indicated in the
Presentation, included sending Greek State HCPs to U.S. congresses.
27. The Presentation further explained how NOVARTIS HELLAS

sought to âdissolveâ this âdefenseâ through, among other things, sending targeted

Greek State HCPs to ophthalmology congresses in Europe and the United States.
Case 2:20-cr-00538-SDW Document 2 Filed 06/25/20 Page 65 of 79 PagelD: 89

This included sending ten HCPs to the U.S. Academyâs congress at a cost of 67,000
euros (then equivalent to approximately $89,000).

28. NOVARTIS HELLAS, through its employees and agents,
falsely recorded the corrupt payments associated with congress sponsorships as
legitimate advertising and promotion expenses in NOVARTIS HELLASâs internal
accounting records. By recording these payments as advertising and promotion
expenses, NOVARTIS HELLAS concealed their true and corrupt nature. These
false records were consolidated into Novartis AGâs financial records and used to
support Novartis AGâs financial reporting to the SEC. As such, NOVARTIS
HELLAS, through its employees and agents, knowingly and willfully conspired
and agreed with others to cause the corrupt payments to be falsely recorded as
legitimate expenses in Novartis AGâs books, records, and accounts.

Details of the Clinical Trial Scheme

 

Background on Clinical Trials at NOVARTIS HELLAS

29. NOVARTIS HELLAS was not responsible for Phase I, II, or
III clinical trials, which relate to different phases of the process leading from a
drugâs discovery to government approval. However, NOVARTIS HELLAS
sponsored post-approval clinical trials, known as Phase IV studies and
epidemiological studies, both of which were research studies intended to answer
scientific questions related to medical conditions treated by Novartis-branded
prescription drugs. In this role, and depending on the study, NOVARTIS HELLAS

selected Greek public and private HCPs to gather patient data for the studies.

30. Phase IV studies and epidemiological studies were designed to
inform medical and clinical decisions, not to increase sales. As set forth below,
however, NOVARTIS HELLAS made improper payments to HCPs related to an
epidemiological study intended to increase sales of certain Novartis-branded
prescription drugs.

The EXACTLY Study

31. In or about 2008, employees of NOVARTIS HELLAS
responsible for marketing Novartis-branded hypertension prescription drugs
developed a marketing project named âEXACTLY.â The brand managers prepared
a written âProject Summaryâ for EXACTLY dated November 19, 2008 (the âProject
Summaryâ). According to the Project Summary, NOVARTIS HELLAS planned to
provide HCPs with free blood pressure manometers and the HCPs would provide
NOVARTIS HELLAS with information related to their patients, including
uncontrolled or newly diagnosed patients with hypertension. Through EXACTLY,
NOVARTIS HELLAS sought to increase sales of Novartis-branded hypertension
prescription drugs.

32. The Project Summary described including over 2,200 HCPs
who, in turn, treated over 44,000 patients. With an anticipated return on
investment (âROIâ) of 3.04, the planned investment of over 2.8 million euros
(equivalent to then approximately $3.8 million) in payments to HCPs through

EXACTLY was expected to yield sales of over 8.6 million euros (the equivalent to

then approximately $11.9 million). This projected ROI, the Project Summary
explained, included over 16,000 ânewly diagnosed or uncontrolled patients.â

33. On or about November 19, 2008, the Project Summary for
EXACTLY was submitted to NOVARTIS HELLASâs Country Compliance Board
(âCCBâ) for internal approval. As reflected in the CCBâs Program Review Meeting
Minutes from on or about November 19, 2008, the CCB deemed EXACTLY to be
âof high value,â but decided that all or part of the project should be converted to a
âScientific Investigation.â The CCB made this decision, in part, because
EXACTLY involved collecting patient data and would thus require approval from
the Greek governmentâs National Organization for Medicines (Ethnikos
Organismos Farmakon) (the âGreek EOFâ).

34. NOVARTIS HELLAS accordingly redesigned a portion of
EXACTLY as an epidemiological investigational study designed âto evaluate the
percentage of uncontrolled hypertensive patientsâ in Greece. Instead of providing
free manometers to HCPs, the investigational study version of EXACTLY entailed
NOVARTIS HELLAS paying participating HCPs directly. Participating HCPs
were responsible for gathering patient data and completing case report forms to
record data for each enrolled patient.

35. In or about February 2009, the Greek EOF approved

EXACTLY as an investigational study.

36. From in or about April 2009 through in or about December
2009, NOVARTIS HELLAS and HCPs conducted the EXACTLY study which was
designed to target over 2,200 HCPs and over 44,000 patients.

37. Ultimately, NOVARTIS HELLAS, through its employees and
agents, made improper payments to HCPs.

38. Many of the forms that were submitted contained mistakes
and inconsistencies, including forms that failed to indicate whether the patient
suffered from coronary disease, which is strongly linked to hypertension â the
core purported focus of EXACTLY.

39. NOVARTIS HELLASâs employees also recognized that many
HCPs believed that they were paid in exchange for writing prescriptions for
Novartis-branded hypertension prescription drugs and not for providing data as
part of a clinical study. Specifically, on or about April 15, 2010, NOVARTIS
HELLAS held an internal meeting for brand managers and other personnel
involved with EXACTLY âto summarize the learnings and identify next stepsâ (the
âEXACTLY Debriefâ). During the EXACTLY Debrief, which NOVARTIS HELLAS
audio recorded, regarding payments that HCPs received related to EXACTLY, a
number of employees and managers acknowledged the following:

e A NOVARTIS HELLAS manager stated that (as_ translated):
âTA]lthough the microphone is recording... . you all know this very well,
I just repeat, that the doctor believes that he/she participates in a study
[EXACTLY] and gets paid for what he prescribes in reality and not for
what he/she writes in the study. .. Consequently, the doctorâs impression

was that they participate just so that they get paid for what they
prescribe.â

e A NOVARTIS HELLAS sales manager stated (as translated): â[T]he
main issue is... that the doctors believe that the study was conducted
in order to get paid for what they write, right?â

e A NOVARTIS HELLAS medical manager stated (as translated) that a
clinical study âis a part of the marketing mix; we do not disagree that
this is a type of benefit provided to the doctors. They know that they will
get paid, this is what happens in reality.â

e A NOVARTIS HELLAS brand manager stated that (as translated): âTo
be honest, the studies were conducted in a similar way in the past as
well; they were conducted as marketing projects. Thatâs within
quotation marks. Between us.â

40. NOVARTIS HELLAS, through its employees and agents,
falsely recorded these payments related to EXACTLY as advertising and
promotion expenses in NOVARTIS HELLASâs internal accounting records. By
doing so, NOVARTIS HELLAS concealed their true and improper nature. These
false records were consolidated into Novartis AGâs financial records and were used
to support Novartis AGâs financial reporting to the SEC. As such, NOVARTIS
HELLAS, through its employees and agents, knowingly and willfully conspired
and agreed with others to cause the payments related to EXACTLY to be falsely

recorded as legitimate expenses in Novartis AGâs books, records, and accounts.

(Conspiracy to Violate the Antibribery Provisions of the FCPA)

41. Paragraphs 1 through 8 and 10 through 28 of this Information
are realleged here.

42. Between in or about 2012 and in or about 2015, within the
United States and elsewhere, defendant

NOVARTIS HELLAS S.A.C.I.

together with Novartis Hellas Employee 1, Novartis Hellas Employee 2, and
others known and unknown, knowingly and willfully did combine, conspire,
confederate, and agree together and with each other to commit an offense against
the United States, that is: while in the territory of the United States, through its
employees and agents, did corruptly commit acts in furtherance of an offer,
payment, promise to pay, and authorization of the giving of anything of value toa
foreign official and to any person, while knowing that all or a portion of such
money and thing of value would be and had been offered, given, and promised to
a foreign official for purposes of: G) influencing acts and decisions of such foreign
official in his or her official capacity; Gi) inducing such foreign official to do and
omit to do acts in violation of the lawful duty of such official; (iii) securing any
improper advantage; and (iv) inducing such foreign official to use his or her
influence with a foreign government and agencies and instrumentalities thereof
to affect and influence acts and decisions of such government and agencies and

instrumentalities, in order to assist NOVARTIS HELLAS in obtaining and

retaining business for and with, and directing business to, NOVARTIS HELLAS,
contrary to 15 U.S.C. Â§ 78dd-3.

Object of the Conspiracy

 

43. The object of the conspiracy was for NOVARTIS HELLAS and
its co-conspirators to gain improper business advantages for NOVARTIS
HELLAS, including increased sales of Lucentis, a Novartis-branded drug, by
bribing Greek State HCPs through sponsorships to attend international medical
congresses.

Manner and Means of the Conspiracy

 

44. The manner and means by which NOVARTIS HELLAS and
its co-conspirators and others sought to accomplish the object of the conspiracy
included, among other things, the following:

a. NOVARTIS HELLAS, through certain of its employees
and agents, including Novartis Hellas Employee 1 and Novartis Hellas Employee
2, sponsored Greek State HCPs to attend international congresses as a means to
bribe and corruptly influence the HCPs to increase prescriptions of Lucentis.

b. NOVARTIS HELLAS paid for public and private
ophthalmologists in Greece to attend international âmedical congresses.â These
congresses were organized by various medical associations in the United States
and Europe, and typically took place over several days in a destination city in the

United States or Europe.

C. By sponsoring Greek State HCPs to attend

congresses, NOVARTIS HELLAS paid for the costs associated with that Greek
State HCPâs attendance such as airfare, hotel accommodations, and congress
registration fees. NOVARTIS HELLAS typically paid for travel costs associated
with congresses through third-party travel agencies. For each individual Greek
State HCP, the total cost to NOVARTIS HELLAS for attendance of an
international congress often exceeded $6,000.

d. NOVARTIS HELLASâs policies stated that the purpose
for sending HCPs to congresses was to provide scientific or educational
information. In reality, however, sales employees at NOVARTIS HELLAS,
including Novartis Hellas Employee 1, sometimes used international congresses
to improperly influence and induce Greek State HCPs to increase prescriptions
for Lucentis.

e. As part of the scheme, NOVARTIS HELLAS
maintained internal documentation noting that HCPs with the highest potential
and highest propensity to prescribe Lucentis would receive âinvestments,â such as
sponsorships to attend international congresses, while HCPs with lower potential
and less propensity to prescribe Lucentis would receive no such âinvestments.â

f. NOVARTIS HELLAS, through its employees and
agents, falsely recorded the corrupt payments associated with congress
sponsorships as legitimate advertising and promotion expenses in NOVARTIS

HELLASâs internal accounting records. By recording these payments as

17
Case 2:20-cr-00538-SDW Document 2 Filed 06/25/20 Page 73 of 79 PagelD: 97

advertising and promotion expenses, NOVARTIS HELLAS concealed their true
and corrupt nature.
Overt Acts
45. In furtherance of the conspiracy and to effect its object,
