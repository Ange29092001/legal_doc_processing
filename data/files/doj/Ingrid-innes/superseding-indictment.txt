THE GRAND JURY CHARGES:

At all times relevant to this Superseding Indictment, unless otherwise stated:
Ii The Defendants and Relevant Individuals and Entities

1. The defendant DONVILLE INNISS, a United States lawful permanent
resident who resided in Tampa, Florida, and Barbados, was a member of the Parliament of
Barbados and the Minister of Industry, International Business, Commerce, and Small Business
Development of Barbados (collectively, âMinister of Industryâ). INNISS was a public official
in Barbados and a âforeign officialâ as that term is used in the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
(âFCPAâ), Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2(h)(2)(A).

2. Insurance Corporation of Barbados Ltd. (âICBLââ) was an insurance
company headquartered in Barbados that offered various financial products, including individual
life, health and casualty insurance.

3s The defendant INGRID INNES was a citizen of Canada and a resident of

Barbados. INNES was the Chief Executive Officer (âCEOâ) of ICBL.
4. The defendant ALEX TASKER was a citizen and resident of Barbados.
TASKER was a senior vice president of ICBL.

5; ICBL Executive 1, an individual whose identity is known to the Grand
Jury, was a citizen and resident of Barbados. ICBL Executive 1 was the Chief Financial Officer
of ICBL.

6. The âBermuda Company,â a corporation the identity of which is known to
the Grand Jury, was an insurance company headquartered in Bermuda that offered various
financial products, including life, property and casualty insurance. The Bermuda Company was
the majority shareholder of ICBL.

de The âNew York Dental Company,â a corporation the identity of which is
known to the Grand Jury, was a dental company that was incorporated in New York in 1992 and
had an address in Elmont, New York. The New York Dental Company was thus a âdomestic
concernâ as that term is used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section
78dd-2(h)(1)(B).

8. Co-Conspirator 1 (âCC-1ââ), an individual whose identity is known to the
Grand Jury, was a United States citizen and a resident of Tampa, Florida. CC-1 was thus a
âdomestic concernâ as that term is used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section
78dd-2(h)(1)(A). CC-1 was the CEO of the New York Dental Company and owned and
controlled the company.

9, The Barbados Investment and Development Corporation (âBIDCâ) was an
agency of the government of Barbados. The defendant DONVILLE INNISS, as the Minister of

Industry, exercised authority over the BIDC.
Il. The Fraudulent Schemes

10. From in or about and between August 2015 and April 2016, the defendant
DONVILLE INNISS leveraged his positon as the Minister of Industry and engaged in a scheme
to accept approximately $36,000 in bribes from ICBL, in violation of Barbadian law, and to
launder that money to and through the United States. ICBL employees, including the
defendants INGRID INNES and ALEX TASKER, agreed to pay bribes to INNISS, who, in
return, agreed to use his official position as the Minister of Industry to cause the BIDC to renew
insurance contracts with ICBL.

11. In furtherance of the scheme, the defendant INGRID INNES, the
defendant ALEX TASKER and ICBL Executive 1 caused ICBLâs majority shareholder, the
Bermuda Company, to make bribe payments to the defendant DONVILLE INNISS through a
United States bank account in the name of the New York Dental Company, which had no actual
business with ICBL. ICBL employees, including INNES, TASKER and ICBL Executive 1, did
not disclose to the Bermuda Company that the payments were for the benefit of a Barbadian
government official and instead falsely claimed that the payments were for â[c]onsulting
services.â

T. In or about July 2015, the defendant DONVILLE INNISS, using his
official position as Minister of Industry, caused the BIDC to renew an insurance contract with
ICBL (the â2015 Contractâ). By its terms, the 2015 Contract required the BIDC to pay a
premium of approximately 661,469.30 Barbadian Dollars, which was the equivalent of

approximately $330,734.65, to ICBL.
13. In return, ICBL employees, including the defendants INGRID INNES and

ALEX TASKER, agreed to pay a bribe of approximately $16,536.73 to the defendant
DONVILLE INNISS, in consideration for having caused the BIDC to renew the 2015 Contract.
The bribe payment of approximately $16,536.73 was five percent of the premium that the BIDC
owed to ICBL under the 2015 Contract.

14. To conceal the bribe payments, the defendant DONVILLE INNISS
arranged to launder the bribes through a bank account at âBank 1,â a bank the identity of which
is known to the Grand Jury, with an address in Elmont, New York, in the name of the New York
Dental Company (the âNew York Dental Company Bank Accountâ). The payment was routed
through a branch of Bank 1| located in Brooklyn, New York. CC-1 was the authorized
representative of the New York Dental Company Bank Account.

15. On or about August 17, 2015, the Bermuda Company transferred
approximately $16,536.73 to the New York Dental Company Bank Account based on a false
invoice provided by the defendant INGRID INNES, the defendant ALEX TASKER and ICBL
Executive 1 for purported consulting services. On or about August 19, 2015, the New York
Dental Company transferred approximately $16,000 to a Bank 1 account in the United States in
the name of the defendant DONVILLE INNISS (the âINNISS Bank Accountâ) via a check
transaction. The New York Dental Company check for approximately $16,000 was made
payable to INNISS.

16. In or about March 2016, the defendant DONVILLE INNISS, using his
position as Minister of Industry, caused the BIDC to renew another insurance contract with
ICBL (the â2016 Contractâ).

17. In return, ICBL employees, including the defendants INGRID INNES and
ALEX TASKER, agreed to pay an additional bribe of approximately $20,000 to the defendant

DONVILLE INNISS, in consideration for having caused the BIDC to renew the 2016 Contract.
18. On or about April 18, 2016, the Bermuda Company transferred
approximately $20,000 to the New York Dental Company Bank Account based on a false
invoice provided by the defendant INGRID INNES, the defendant ALEX TASKER and ICBL
Executive 1 for purported consulting services. On or about April 25, 2016, the New York
Dental Company made transfers of approximately $9,000 and $8,000 to the INNISS Bank
Account via check transactions. The New York Dental Company checks for approximately
$9,000 and $8,000 were made payable to the defendant DONVILLE INNISS. On or about
April 27, 2016, the New York Dental Company transferred approximately $2,750 to the INNISS

Bank Account via a check transaction. The New York Dental Company check for $2,750 was

 

made payable to INNISS.
Ul. Barbados Prevention of Corruption Act
19. The Prevention of Corruption Act of Barbados (the âBarbados Prevention

of Corruption Actâ) provided in Section 3(1) that â[a]ny person who, by himself or by or in
conjunction with any person, corruptly solicits or receives or agrees to receive, for himself or for
any other person, any gift, loan, fee, reward or advantage whatsoever as an inducement to, or
reward for or otherwise on account of any member, officer or servant of the Crown or of a public
body doing or forbearing to do anything in respect of any matter or transaction whatsoever,
actual or proposed, in which the Crown or such public body is concerned, shall be guilty of a
misdemeanour.â

20. The Barbados Prevention of Corruption Act provided in Section 6 that â[a]
person convicted on indictment of a misdemeanour under this Act, where the matter or
transaction in relation to which the offence was committed was a contract, or a proposal for a

contract, with the Crown or any Government Department or any public body, or a sub-contract to
execute any work comprised in such a contract, shall be liable to imprisonment for any term not
exceeding seven nor less than three years.â

21. The Barbados Prevention of Corruption Act provided in Section 7 that
â[w]here, in any proceedings against a person for an offence under this Acct, it is proved that any
money, gift or other consideration has been paid or given to or received by a person in the
employment of the Crown or any Government Department or a public body by or from a person
or agent of a person holding or seeking to obtain a contract from the Crown or any Government
Department or public body, the money, gift or consideration shall, for the purposes of this Act,
be deemed to have been paid or given and received corruptly as inducement or reward, unless the

contrary is proved.â
