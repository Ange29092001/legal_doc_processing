INFORMATION
THE UNITED STATES CHARGES:
Introduction

At all times material to this information:

1. Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (âPDVSAâ) was the Venezuelan state-
owned and state-controlled oil company. PDVSA and its subsidiaries were
responsible for the exploration, production, refining, transportation, and trade in
energy resources in Venezuela and provided funding for other operations of the
Venezuelan government. PDVSA and its wholly-owned subsidiaries were
âinstrumentalitiesâ of the Venezuelan government as that term is used in the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (âFCPAâ), Title 15, United States Code, Section
78dd-2(h)(2)(A).

2. Defendant JOSE LUIS RAMOS CASTILLO (âDefendant
RAMOSâ), a resident of Venezuela and then Fort Bend County, Texas, was

employed by PDVSA or by wholly-owned subsidiaries or affiliates thereof from in
or around 2002 until in or around September 2013. During that time, Defendant
RAMOS held a number of positions related to purchasing, including purchasing
manager and superintendent of purchasing. Defendant RAMOSâs job
responsibilities included selecting companies for bidding panels, which allowed
those companies to submit bids on individual PDVSA projects, and the ability to
select winning companies for the economic portion of the bid process. Defendant
RAMOS was a âforeign officialâ as that term is used in of the FCPA, Title 15,
United States Code, Section 78dd-2(h)(2)(A).

3. âBUSINESSMAN 1,â an individual whose identity is known to the
United States, was the owner of a number of U.S.-based energy companies,
including several companies based in the Southern District of Texas, that supplied
equipment and services to PDVSA, and a resident of Texas, and thus a âdomestic
concernâ and an officer, director, employee, agent, and shareholder of a âdomestic
concernâ as those terms are used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code,
Section 78dd-2(h)(1).

4, âBUSINESSMAN 2,â an individual whose identity is known to the
United States, was the owner of a number of other U.S.-based energy companies
that supplied equipment and services to PDVSA, and a resident of the United
States, and thus a âdomestic concernâ and an officer, director, employee, agent,

and shareholder of a âdomestic concernâ as those terms are used in the FCPA, Title
15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2(h)(1). BUSINESSMAN 1 and
BUSINESSMAN 2 worked together on a number of PDVSA contracts and
contract bids.

5. âBUSINESSMAN 3,â an individual whose identity is known to the
United States, was the owner of a number of U.S.-based energy companies that
supplied equipment and services to PDVSA, and a resident of the United States,
and thus a âdomestic concernâ and an officer, director, employee, agent, and
shareholder of a âdomestic concernâ as those terms are used in the FCPA, Title 15,

United States Code, Section 78dd-2(h)(1).
