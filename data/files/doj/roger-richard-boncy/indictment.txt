The Conspiracy to Violate the Travel Act and the FCPA

11. Inor about and between November 2014 and December 2015, both dates being
approximate and inclusive, BAPTISTE and BONCY conspired with one another, and with others
known and unknown to the Grand Jury, to bribe foreign officials to obtain and to retain business
in connection with the Port Project.

12. __ As part of the conspiracy, BAPTISTE, BONCY, and others known and unknown
to the Grand Jury solicited bribe money from two undercover agents of the Federal Bureau
Investigation (âFBIââ) posing as prospective investors in the Port Project (ââUC-1â and âUC-2â;
jointly the âUCsâ), which was expected to cost approximately $84 million and was to involve the
construction of a cement factory in its first phase. BAPTISTE told the UCs that, in order to
secure government approval of the project, he would bribe Haitian officials. In order to conceal
the bribe payments, BAPTISTE told the UCs that he would funnel the payments through Non-
Profit.

13. At BAPTISTEâs direction, UC-2 wired $50,000 to Non-Profitâs bank account as
part of the bribery scheme. BAPTISTE used the initial $50,000 for his personal expenses and
planned to use future payments from UC-2 to make bribe payments to Haitian government
officials in connection with the Port Project.

Objects of the Conspiracy to Violate the Travel Act and the FCPA

14. The principal purpose and object of the conspiracy charged in Count One was to

enrich the co-conspirators by paying bribes to Haitian officials to obtain and retain business for

BAPTISTE, BONCY, CC-1, CC-2, Company, and others in connection with the Port Project.

Case 1:17-cr-10305-ADB Document 74 Filed 10/30/18 Page 5 of 17

17. Onor about November 13, 2014, BAPTISTE flew from Baltimore-Washington
International Airport in Maryland to Boston Logan International Airport in Massachusetts to
attend a meeting with UC-1 at a Boston-area hotel. |

18. On or about November 13, 2014, BAPTISTE held a meeting with UC-1, during
which he: discussed a possible investment with UC-1 in the Port Project; confirmed to UC-1 that
a âpay-to-playâ system existed in Haiti; described bribe payments that would have to be made in
connection with the Port Project, as well as how they could be made; and explained that he could
use Non-Profit to conceal and facilitate bribe payments to the Haitian officials.

19. Onor about August 13, 2015, BAPTISTE called UC-1 and discussed plans for an
in-person meeting in Boston, Massachusetts to review details of the Port Project with BONCY.

20. On or about October 10, 2015, BONCY sent an email to UC-1, to which he
attached letters from Haitian officials, including a letter signed by Foreign Official-1âs
predecessor. The letters contained assurances that the Haitian government would support the
Port Project.

21. | Onor about November 12, 2015, BAPTISTE flew from Baltimore- Washington
International Airport in Maryland to Boston Logan International Airport to attend a meeting with
BONCY, CC-1 and the UCs at a Boston-area hotel.

22. On or about November 12, 2015, BONCY traveled from Madrid, Spain, to New
York, New York, and then to Boston Logan International Airport to attend the meeting with
BAPTISTE, CC-1 and the UCs.

23. On or about November 12, 2015, BAPTISTE, BONCY and CC-1 met with UC-1

and UC-2, who was introduced at the meeting as UC-1âs boss.
Case 1:17-cr-10305-ADB Document 74 Filed 10/30/18 Page 6 of 17

24. At the meeting on or about November 12, 2015, BAPTISTE, BONCY, and CC-1
spoke to the UCs about the Port Project and solicited the UCs to invest in a factory that would
constitute the first phase of the project, with an estimated cost of approximately $84 million,
with 5% of the funding allocated to bribery of Haitian government officials to ensure progress on
the Port Project.

25. During the November 12, 2015 meeting, BAPTISTE went to a suite at the hotel
and had a one-on-one conversation with UC-2. During that conversation, BAPTISTE confirmed
that bribes totaling approximately 5% of the cost of the factory would be paid to Haitian
officials, including Foreign Official-1 and other officials within the Haitian government.
BAPTISTE told UC-2 that he would conceal and facilitate the bribe payments by using Non-
Profit as a conduit for the bribe payments.

26. Shortly after leaving the November 12, 2015 meeting, BAPTISTE called CC-2
and said that he had explained to UC-2 that it would be necessary to pay bribes to Haitian
officials to move forward on the Port Project. BAPTISTE asked CC-2 to begin drafting a budget
for the project.

27. Onor about November 16, 2015, BAPTISTE told UC-2 that he was traveling to
Haiti in connection with the Port Project, and that he was going to meet with Foreign Official-1
to obtain an updated letter of support for the Port Project. When UC-2 asked BAPTISTE if
BAPTISTE needed anything from UC-2, BAPTISTE responded that UC-2 needed to wire him
money as soon as possible.

28. Thereafter, on or about November 16, 2015, BAPTISTE sent UC-2 an email

containing the account and routing numbers for Non-Profitâs bank account in the United States,
Case 1:17-cr-10305-ADB Document 74 Filed 10/30/18 Page 7 of 17

so that UC-2 could wire money to BAPTISTE that BAPTISTE could use to pay bribes to obtain
an updated letter of support from Foreign Official-1.

29. On or about November 20, 2015, BAPTISTE called UC-2, asked him to wire
$25,000 to Non-Profitâs bank account so that BAPTISTE could give it to Foreign Official-1.
BAPTISTE told UC-2 that BAPTISTE would be able to access money sent to Non-Profitâs bank
account in the United States when BAPTISTE would be in Haiti.

30. In that same conversation, BAPTISTE also told UC-2 that CC-2 would also have
access to Non-Profitâs bank account in Haiti and would be BAPTISTEâs agent in Haiti when
BAPTISTE was in the United States.

31. On or about November 20, 2015, after UC-2 wired $25,000 to Non-Profitâs bank
account per BAPTISTEâs instructions, BAPTISTE sent UC-2, via text message and email,
photographs of himself meeting with Foreign Official-1 in Haiti.

32. Onor about November 24, 2015, BAPTISTE called CC-2 to discuss opening a
bank account in Haiti for Non-Profit, and CC-2 asked BAPTISTE if he had received the money
from UC-2.

33. On or about November 25, 2015, BAPTISTE called BONCY and told him that he
had spoken to Aide-1. BAPTISTE inquired whether it was prudent to suggest to Aide-1 that
Aide-1 would also be compensated if Foreign Official-1 authorized the Port Project. BONCY
agreed that this was a good idea.

34. On or about November 25, 2015, BAPTISTE called Aide-1 and said that
BAPTISTE and BONCY had talked about giving Aide-1 a job as an engineer on the Port Project

in exchange for Aide-1âs help in obtaining Foreign Official-1âs authorization for the project.
Case 1:17-cr-10305-ADB Document 74 Filed 10/30/18 Page 8 of 17

35. | Onor about November 27, 2015, BAPTISTE and BONCY discussed by
telephone their plan to bribe Foreign Official-1 and Aide-1 in relation to the Port Project.

36. | Onor about the evening of December 3, 2015, during a phone call with UC-2,
BAPTISTE said that he had used the $25,000 wired by UC-2 to Non-Profitâs bank account to
pay, in cash, Aide-1, Aide-2, and Lawyer-1, that these payments amounted to only part of what
BAPTISTE had promised the staffers for their efforts, and that UC-2 should send him another
$25,000 to complete the payments. BAPTISTE also told UC-2 that he had told Foreign Official-
1 that he was going to put Foreign Official-1 on the âpayrollâ and hire him as an advisor for the
Port Project after Foreign Official-1 left office.

37. | Onor about December 4, 2015, BAPTISTE sent an email to UC-2 attaching a
letter that falsely described the $25,000 payment previously provided by UC-2 as a charitable,
tax-deductible donation to Non-Profit.

38. | Onor about December 8, 2015, BAPTISTE told UC-2 during a phone call that he
had obtained an updated letter of support from Foreign Official-1 in exchange for bribes that
BAPTISTE had paid, and that BONCY would send the letter to UC-2.

39. | Onor about December 9, 2015, BONCY emailed UC-2 the updated letter of
support, which was dated December 4, 2015, and signed by Foreign Official-1.

40. On or about December 10, 2015, after UC-2 had wired an additional $25,000 to
Non-Profitâs bank account, BAPTISTE sent UC-2 by email another letter from Non-Profit
falsely describing the second $25,000 payment as a charitable, tax-deductible donation.

41. Onor about December 10, 2015, CC-2 called BAPTISTE about moving forward
on the Port Project, and BAPTISTE told CC-2 that to move the Port Project forward quickly,

BAPTISTE and others would pay bribes to government officials in Haiti. CC-2 told BAPTISTE
Case 1:17-cr-10305-ADB Document 74 Filed 10/30/18 Page 9 of 17

that they should form a new company in addition to Non-Profit so that Non-Profit would not be
too involved in the Port Project.

42. On or about December 18, 2015, as part of an e-mail discussion between
BAPTISTE and BONCY about how they should obtain the funds from the UCs for BAPTISTE
to use with âthe local authorities,â BAPTISTE told BONCY that they could not delay payment
of the bribe money because the âpeople who have help [sic] make this contract possible will not
wait.â

43. | Onor about December 20, 2015, BONCY emailed the UCs a proposed budget for
the Port Project that included a line item for the funds that BAPTISTE, BONCY, and CC-1 had
discussed using for bribes to Haitian government officials.

The Money Laundering Conspiracy

44. In or about and between November 2014 and December 2015, both dates being
approximate and inclusive, BAPTISTE and BONCY conspired with one another and with others
known and unknown to the Grand Jury to transmit money from the United States to Haiti in
order to promote the bribery scheme described above.

45. | Among the manner and means by which BAPTISTE and BONCY and co-
conspirators known and unknown to the Grand Jury carried out the money laundering conspiracy
were the following:

a. Falsely characterizing bribes to be paid to Haitian officials in relation to the Port
Project as charitable donations to Non-Profit;
b. Directing CC-2 to open a bank account for Non-Profit in Haiti to facilitate wire

transfers from the United States;
Case 1:17-cr-10305-ADB Document 74 Filed 10/30/18 Page 10 of 17

c. Preparing and sending to the UCs a proposed budget that reserved 5% of the
Port Projectâs funds for bribes to Haitian officials, which the budget falsely

described as charitable contributions.
