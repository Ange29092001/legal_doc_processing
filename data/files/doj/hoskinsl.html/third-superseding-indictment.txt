The Grand Jury charges:

COUNT ONE
(Conspiracy)

At all times relevant, unless otherwise specified:

Mk The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, Title 15, United States
Code, Sections 78dd-1, et seg. (âFCPAâ), was enacted by Congress for the purpose of, among
other things, making it unlawful for certain classes of persons and entities to act corruptly in
furtherance of an offer, promise, authorization, or payment of money or anything of value to a
foreign government official for the purpose of assisting in obtaining or retaining business for, or
directing business to, any person.

De Alstom S.A. (âAlstomâ), which has been charged separately, was headquartered
in France. Alstom was in the business of providing power generation and transportation related
services around the world, including Indonesia. Alstom had sales of roughly â¬17 billion

annually and roughly 75,000 employees in over seventy countries. Shares of Alstomâs stock
Case 3:12-cr-00238-JBA Document 209 Filed 04/15/15 Page 2 of 33

were listed on the New York Stock Exchange until August 2004. Accordingly, until August
2004, Alstom was an âissuerâ as that term is used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code,
Section 78dd-1(a). Alstom had direct and indirect subsidiaries in various countries around the
world, including a subsidiary in Connecticut, Alstom Power, Inc. (âAlstom Power USâ),
described in more detail below. Other subsidiaries of Alstom included Alstom Network Schweiz
AG, formerly known as Alstom Prom AG (âAlstom PROMâ), PT Energy Systems Indonesia
(âAlstom Indonesiaâ), Alstom Ltd, formerly known as Alstom UK Ltd (âAlstom UKâ), and
Alstom Resources Management S.A. in France. Reflecting the close relationship between them,
Alstom and its subsidiaries, including Alstom Power US, Alstom PROM, and Alstom Indonesia,
were often referred to by Alstom employees as âAlstomâ without distinction. Through its
subsidiaries, Alstom bid on projects to secure contracts to perform power-related and
transportation-related services, including for state-owned entities. Alstom maintained a
department called International Network that supported its subsidiariesâ efforts to secure
contracts around the world. International Network was organized by geographic region.

3. The defendant, LAWRENCE HOSKINS (âHOSKINSâ), was employed by
Alstom UK but was assigned to Alstom Resources Management S.A. in France. HOSKINS
worked in Alstomâs International Network and was the Senior Vice President for the Asia
region. In that capacity, HOSKINS performed functions and support services for and on behalf
of various other Alstom subsidiaries, including Alstom Power US, as described more fully
below.

4, Marubeni, which has been charged separately, was a trading company
headquartered in Japan that did business around the world, including Indonesia. Marubeni and

its subsidiaries and joint ventures had trading transactions of roughly $74 billion annually and
Case 3:12-cr-00238-JBA Document 209 Filed 04/15/15 Page 3 of 33

roughly 24,000 employees in over 70 countries. In conducting its business, Marubeni received
assistance from its subsidiaries and joint ventures, including Marubeni Power Systems
Corporation (âMPSCâ), a wholly owned subsidiary of Marubeni that shared its offices with
Marubeni and acted as an agent on Marubeniâs behalf.

5. The Tarahan Project (or âTarahanâ) was a project to provide power-related
services to the citizens of Indonesia that was bid and contracted through Indonesiaâs state-owned
and state-controlled electricity company, Perusahaan Listrik Negara (âPLNâ), valued at roughly
$118 million. PLN was an âagencyâ and âinstrumentalityâ of a foreign government, as those
terms are used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Sections 78dd-1(f)(1), 78dd-2(h)(2),
and 78dd-3(f)(2). PLN was responsible for sourcing the Tarahan Project.

6. Alstom and its subsidiaries, including Alstom Power US, Alstom PROM, and
Alstom Indonesia, partnered with Marubeni and its subsidiaries, including MPSC (collectively,
the âConsortiumââ), in the bidding and carrying out of the Tarahan Project in Indonesia. Alstom
and its subsidiaries were to provide boiler-related services in connection with the Tarahan
Project while Marubeni was to manage all works, including auxiliary equipment and civil
building and installation work.

7. The Consortium retained two consultants, described in more detail below as
âConsultant Aâ and âConsultant B,â to assist them in obtaining the Tarahan Project contract.
The consultantsâ primary purpose was not to provide legitimate consulting services to the
Consortium but was instead to pay bribes to Indonesian officials who had the ability to influence
the award of the Tarahan Project contract.

8. HOSKINS, in his capacity as Senior Vice President for the Asia Region at

Alstom, was one of the people responsible for approving the selection of, and authorizing
Case 3:12-cr-00238-JBA Document 209 Filed 04/15/15 Page 4 of 33

payments to, Consultants A and B, knowing that a portion of the payments to Consultants A and
B was intended for Indonesian officials in exchange for their influence and assistance in
awarding the Tarahan Project contract to the Consortium.

9. The Consortium first retained Consultant A in or around late 2002. Consultant A
was to receive a commission based on the overall value of the Tarahan Project contract, from
which he was expected to pay bribes to Indonesian officials. However, through the course of
2003, HOSKINS and other employees of the Consortium came to the conclusion that Consultant
A was not effectively bribing key Indonesian officials. Accordingly, in or around September or
October 2003, HOSKINS and other employees of the Consortium informed Consultant A that
Consultant A would be responsible only for paying bribes to Official 1, a Member of the
Indonesian Parliament described in more detail below, and that the Consortium would retain
another consultant to pay bribes to PLN officials. Shortly thereafter, the Consortium sent
Consultant A an amended consulting agreement, reducing the amount of Consultant Aâs
commission to reflect Consultant Aâs reduced responsibilities, and retained Consultant B to bribe
PLN officials.

10. | The Consortium were ultimately awarded the Tarahan Project contract and made
payments to the aforementioned âconsultants,â including payments to Consultant A, who then
used a portion of these commission payments to pay bribes to Official 1.

me by tomorrow a plan to recover this. WE CAN NOT LOOSE [sic] THIS PROJECT!â

56. On or about September 18, 2003, an employee at Alstom Indonesia sent an e-mail
to Alstom Indonesia Employee B and another Alstom employee regarding a meeting with
employees of Alstom and Marubeni and members of PLN, stating, âPLN has expressed their
concerns over our âagentâ. They did not like the approach made by the agent. More importantly,
thev concern [sic] whether they can count on the agent or not in regards to ârewardsâ issue, They
concern [sic] that if we have won the job, whether their rewards will still be satisfactory or this
agent only give them pocket money and disappear. Nothing has been shown by the agent that
the agent is willing to spend money....As things still changes [sic] (until the contract signed), if
we are not careful, PLN personnel can take negative actions against us to secure their âpersonal
interestâ. During the discussion, Marubeni questioned why we knew many things when the
issues were already on the table, not when they were still preliminary. I also see that our friends
are not interested to give details, I think we need to establish other contacts.â (Emphasis in
original).

57. On or about September 25, 2003, Marubeni Employee A sent an e-mail to

Representative today.â

that: (i) they were going to retain another consultant to pay bribes to officials at PLN in
connection with the Tarahan Project; (ii) Consultant A needed to pay bribes only to Official 1;
and (iii) Consultant Aâs commission, therefore, would be cut from three percent of the total value
of the contract to one percent.

59. On or about October 1, 2003, Marubeni Employee A, on behalf of Marubeni, sent
a letter to Consultant B regarding the Tarahan Project, and stated, âWith reference to our
discussion regarding the captioned project, we are pleased to confirm the agreement between us.
In the event that we are successful, we confirm that we will pay a total of two percent (2%) of
the contract price (not including VAT) for our scope of work to you for the various services you

18
Case 3:12-cr-00238-JBA Document 209 Filed 04/15/15 Page 19 of 33

managed to talk to [Official 2] directly, in part because he does not want to address the issue
directly. I have one minor comment though. Could you fix the payment dates for the 30% and
70%? First [sic] portion at the activation of the contract, when it is signed and the down
payment is made and the second one four months or six months thereafter. Given the nature of
my involvement (or lack of) with PLN under the new scheme, my friend and I do not want to be
involved in the PLN performance and payment issues. Finally, I have not been able to get a
contract out of Marubeni even though they keep saying there is no problem. They also told
[Official 2] that they do not have a firm commitment to me yet and that has not sat well with
[Official 1]. So please give them a nodge [sic]. Hopefully we can sign both contracts at the
same time.â

62. On or about November 2, 2003, Pomponi sent an e-mail to Marubeni Employee A
and another Marubeni employee, copying Pierucci, Alstom Indonesia Employee A, Alstom
Indonesia Employee B, and another Alstom Power US employee, stating, âI spoke with

support to PLN.â

65. On or about March 3, 2004, Alstom Indonesia Employee A sent an e-mail to
HOSKINS, stating, âLast Monday we sent Tarahan CA [consultancy agreement] to [Consultant
B], he immediately feel [sic] cornered after reading the ToP [terms of payment] which said
âprorataâ. When IJ talked to him on the phone I said that I will look at it and ] thought it should
not be that bad. I then looked into Tarahan ToP (see attached) and realise that the project
payment is spread over 3.5 year! You would understand why he is worry [sic], he is willing to
pre-finance his scope, fulfilling his commitment up-front (prior he get paid) to get the right
âinfluenceâ, but certainly not waiting 2 to 3 years to get paid while most of his scope completed
in the beginning.â

others, stating, âI have [Alstom Indonesia Employee A] out in Indonesia negotiating the CA

67, On or about March 18, 2004, HOSKINS responded to the e-mail from Pomponi
referenced in Paragraph 66 above, stating, âNot sure where we are with this but for your info
[Consultant B] is also requesting tougher terms on other projects at the moment. I cannot
comment on your cash flow but my advice in this instance is to go with latest recommendation . .
. [Consultant B] has a lot of work to do to support us in negotiation and he (and others) are
slightly negative at the moment on Alstom support.â

68. On or about March 19, 2004, Consultant A sent an e-mail to Pierucci, stating, âI

am back from Indonesia. I have mentioned the following to Bill [Pomponi]. But it is important

20
Case 3:12-cr-00238-JBA Document 209 Filed 04/15/15 Page 21 of 33

that you also are aware of it. We need a very strong support from [Official 2] to counter
Mitsubishiâs lobbeying [sic] against us. I am not convinced that he is happy enough with us to
provide the support. [Official 1] is also unhappy because he thinks Alstom has not firmly
indicated its support to [Official 2]. Please verify that we have talked to [Official 2]...Please talk
to Bill [Pomponi] about the detail.â
69. On or about March 20, 2004, Pierucci forwarded to HOSKINS and Alstom

have seen your response and wish to offer the following as our compromise to [Consultant Bâs]

-40% at receipt by ALSTOM of the down payment
-Additional 40% at receipt by ALSTOM at month 12

-Last 5% at the end of the contractual obligations

Pls advise if these you think would be acceptable??â

71. On or about March 22, 2004, Pomponi sent an e-mail to Marubeni Employee A,
copying Pierucci and another Marubeni employee, stating, âI am trying to get agreement with
[Consultant B] but heâs objecting strongly and asking for âfront-endâ payments which affect our
cash flow. I consider both you and I as having similar payment schemes for [Consultant B],
therefore pls share with me your proposal and idea. Do you have agreement yet with [Consultant
B] for your portion?? Pls consider this as an urgent request and respond at your most earliest

convenience.â

have no choice. I will send a separate message to [Alstom Indonesia Employee A, Alstom
Indonesia Employee B, Marubeni Employee A, and another Marubeni employee] regarding the
T/P to insure we get [Consultant Bâs] signature and follow-up action with our friends. A note

within the first 12 months of the contract. I stated that this was a problem for ALSTOM
