Companyâs Board of Directors reflected in Attachment B, which is incorporated by reference into
this Agreement, and the United States Department of Justice, Criminal Division, Fraud Section
(the âFraud Sectionâ) and the United States Attorneyâs Office for the District of New Jersey (the
âOfficeâ), enter into this deferred prosecution agreement (the âAgreementâ). Alcon Inc., which is
not a defendant in this matter, also agrees, pursuant to the authority granted by Alcon Inc.âs Board
of Directors, to certain terms and obligations of the Agreement as described below. The terms and
conditions of this Agreement are as follows:

Criminal Information and Acceptance of Responsibility

1. The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Fraud Section and the Office will
file the attached one-count criminal Information (the âInformationâ) in the United States District
Court for the District of New Jersey charging the Company with conspiracy to commit an offense

against the United States, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 371, that is, to
Case 2:20-cr-00539-SDW Document 2 Filed 06/25/20 Page 2 of 70 PagelD: 20

violate the books and records provision of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (âFCPAâ),
as amended, Title 15, United States Code, Sections 78m(b)(2)(A), 78m(b)(5), and 78ff(a). In so
doing, the Company: (a) knowingly waives its right to indictment on these charges, as well as all
rights to a speedy trial pursuant to the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, Title
18, United States Code, Section 3161, and Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 48(b); and (b)
knowingly waives any objection with respect to venue to any charges by the United States arising
out of the conduct described in the Statement of Facts attached hereto as Attachment A (the
âStatement of Factsâ), which is incorporated by reference into this Agreement, and consents to the
filing of the Information, as provided under the terms of this Agreement, in the United States
District Court for the District of New Jersey. The Fraud Section and the Office agree to defer
prosecution of the Company pursuant to the terms and conditions described below.

2. The Company admits, accepts, and acknowledges that it is responsible under United
States law for the acts of its officers, directors, employees, and agents as charged in the
Information, and as set forth in the attached Statement of Facts, and that the allegations described
in the Information and the facts described in the attached Statement of Facts are true and accurate.
Should the Fraud Section or the Office pursue the prosecution that is deferred by this Agreement,
the Company and Alcon Inc. stipulate to the admissibility of the attached Statement of Facts in
any proceeding by the Fraud Section or the Office, including any trial, guilty plea, or sentencing
proceeding, and will not contradict anything in the attached Statement of Facts at any such
proceeding.

Term of the Agreement

3. This Agreement is effective for a period beginning on the date on which the
Case 2:20-cr-00539-SDW Document 2 Filed 06/25/20 Page 3 of 70 PagelD: 21

Information is filed and ending three years from that date (the âTermâ). The Company, and the
parent company, Alcon Inc., agree, however, that, in the event the Fraud Section and the Office
determine, in their sole discretion, that the Company or Alcon Inc. has knowingly violated any
provision of this Agreement or has failed to completely perform or fulfill each of the Companyâs
or Alcon Inc.âs obligations under this Agreement, an extension or extensions of the Term of the
Agreement may be imposed by the Fraud Section and the Office, in their sole discretion, for up to
a total additional time period of one year, without prejudice to the Fraud Sectionâs or the Officeâs
right to proceed as provided in Paragraphs 14 to 18 below. Any extension of the Agreement
extends all terms of this Agreement, including the terms of the reporting requirement in
Attachment D (the âReporting Requirementsâ), for an equivalent period. Conversely, in the event
the Fraud Section and the Office find, in their sole discretion, that there exists a change in
circumstances sufficient to eliminate the Reporting Requirements, and that the other provisions of
this Agreement have been satisfied, the Agreement may be terminated early. If the Court rejects
the Agreement, all provisions of the Agreement shall be deemed null and void, and the Term shall
be deemed to have not begun.

FCPA Corporate Enforcement Policy in the Department of Justice Manual 9-47.120, or pursuant
to the United States Sentencing Guidelines (âU.S.S.G.â or âSentencing Guidelinesâ), because its

disclosure of the conduct described in the attached Statement of Facts was not timely, there was
an imminent threat of disclosure to the Fraud Section and the Office, and the Companyâs former
corporate parent, Novartis AG, was subject to reporting obligations under a prior resolution with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (âSECâ);

b. the Company received full credit for its cooperation, as well as Alcon Inc.âs
and Novartis AGâs cooperation, with the Fraud Sectionâs and the Officeâs investigation, including
conducting a thorough internal investigation; making regular factual presentations to the Fraud
Section and the Office; producing extensive documentation, including documents located outside
of the United States, after taking steps that the Company and its affiliates determined complied
with applicable foreign data privacy, confidentiality, and discovery laws; and providing
translations of foreign language documents;

C. the Company, Alcon Inc., and their former corporate parent companies and
affiliates engaged in remedial measures, including implementing enhanced policies and procedures
relating to, among other things, accounting, anti-corruption, payments to third parties, gifts, travel,
and entertainment; conducting internal reviews and investigations, including site visits, audits, and
risk assessments; working with outside counsel to conduct an extensive internal investigation of
the Companyâs operations in Asia; terminating high-level executives of the Company and
disciplining certain other employees of the Company and its affiliates; and terminating the
Companyâs relationship with the third-party distributor company involved in the conduct described
in the Statement of Facts;

d. the Company and Alcon Inc. have committed to continuing to enhance their

compliance programs and internal controls, including ensuring that their compliance programs

satisfy the minimum elements set forth in Attachment C to the Agreement (the âCorporate
Compliance Programâ);

e. based on the Companyâs and Alcon Inc.âs remediation and the state of their
compliance programs, and the Companyâs and Alcon Inc.âs agreement to report to the Fraud
Section and the Office as set forth in the Reporting Requirements, the Fraud Section and the Office
determined that an independent compliance monitor is unnecessary;

f. Novartis AG, the Companyâs former parent company, has resolved with the
SEC through a cease-and-desist proceeding relating to the conduct described in the attached
Statement of Facts and other conduct, and has agreed to pay $92,300,000 in disgorgement and
prejudgment interest of $20,500,000;

g. the nature and seriousness of the offense conduct, as described in the
attached Statement of Facts, including the falsification of books, records, and accounts to conceal
improper payments to health care providers (âHCPsâ) employed by public institutions in Vietnam,
as well as the duration of the misconduct and the involvement of high-level executives of the
Company;

h. the Company has no prior criminal history;

1. the Company has agreed to continue to cooperate with the Fraud Section
and the Office in any ongoing investigation as described in Paragraph 5 below;

j. accordingly, after considering (a) through (1) above, the Company received
an aggregate discount of 25 percent off the bottom of the otherwise-applicable Sentencing

Guidelines fine range.

being investigated or prosecuted.

d. With respect to any information, testimony, documents, records, or other
tangible evidence provided to the Fraud Section and the Office pursuant to this Agreement, the
Company consents to any and all disclosures, subject to applicable laws and regulations, to other

agree that this penalty is appropriate given the facts and circumstances of this case, including the

agreement by the Fraud Section and the Office that the Total Criminal Fine is the maximum penalty
that may be imposed in any future prosecution, and the Fraud Section and the Office are not
precluded from arguing in any future prosecution that the Court should impose a higher fine,
although the Fraud Section and the Office agree that under those circumstances, they will

recommend to the Court that any amount paid under this Agreement should be offset against any

15
Case 2:20-cr-00539-SDW Document 2 Filed 06/25/20 Page 16 of 70 PagelD: 34

17. The Company and Alcon Inc. acknowledge that the Fraud Section and the Office

expires, the Company, by the Chief Executive Officer of the Company and the Chief Financial
Officer of the Company, will certify to the Fraud Section and the Office that the Company has met

will be deemed a material statement and representation by the Company to the executive branch
of the United States for purposes of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 1001 and 1519, and it
will be deemed to have been made in the judicial district in which this Agreement is filed.

Sale, Merger, or Other Change in Corporate Form of the Company

19. Except as may otherwise be agreed by the parties in connection with a particular
transaction, the Company and Alcon Inc. agree that in the event that, during the Term, the
Company or Alcon Inc. undertake any change in corporate form, including if it sells, merges, or
transfers business operations that are material to the Companyâs or Alcon Inc.âs consolidated
operations, or to the operations of any subsidiaries or affiliates involved in the conduct described

change is structured as a sale, asset sale, merger, transfer, or other change in corporate form, it

shall include in any contract for sale, merger, transfer, or other change in corporate form a

provision binding the purchaser, or any successor in interest thereto, to the obligations described
in this Agreement. The purchaser or successor in interest must also agree in writing that the Fraud
Sectionâs and the Officeâs ability to declare a breach under this Agreement is applicable in full
force to that entity. The Company and Alcon Inc. agree that the failure to include these provisions
in the transaction will make any such transaction null and void. The Company and Alcon Inc.
shall provide notice to the Fraud Section and the Office at least thirty days prior to undertaking
any such sale, merger, transfer, or other change in corporate form. The Fraud Section and the
Office shall notify the Company and Alcon Inc. prior to such transaction (or series of transactions)
if they determine that the transaction(s) will have the effect of circumventing or frustrating the
enforcement purposes of this Agreement. If, at any time during the Term, the Company or Alcon
Inc. engages in a transaction(s) that has the effect of circumventing or frustrating the enforcement
purposes of this Agreement, the Fraud Section and the Office may deem it a breach of this
Agreement pursuant to Paragraphs 14 to 18 of this Agreement. Nothing herein shall restrict the
Company or Alcon Inc. from indemnifying (or otherwise holding harmless) the purchaser or
successor in interest for penalties or other costs arising from any conduct that may have occurred
prior to the date of the transaction, so long as such indemnification does not have the effect of
circumventing or frustrating the enforcement purposes of this Agreement, as determined by the
Fraud Section and the Office.

Public Statements by the Company and Alcon Inc.

20. The Company and Alcon Inc. expressly agree that they shall not, through present
or future attorneys, officers, directors, employees, agents or any other person authorized to speak

for the Company or Alcon Inc., make any public statement, in litigation or otherwise, contradicting

the acceptance of responsibility by the Company or Alcon Inc. set forth above or the facts
described in the attached Statement of Facts. Any such contradictory statement shall, subject to
cure rights of the Company and Alcon Inc. described below, constitute a breach of this Agreement,
and the Company and/or Alcon Inc. thereafter shall be subject to prosecution as set forth in
Paragraphs 14 to 16 of this Agreement. The decision whether any public statement by any such
person contradicting a fact contained in the attached Statement of Facts will be imputed to the
Company and/or Alcon Inc. for the purpose of determining whether it has breached this Agreement
shall be at the sole discretion of the Fraud Section and the Office. If the Fraud Section and the
Office determine that a public statement by any such person contradicts in whole or in part a

ATTACHMENT A

STATEMENT OF FACTS

The following Statement of Facts is incorporated as part of the Deferred Prosecution
Agreement (the âAgreementâ) between the United States Department of Justice, Criminal
Division, Fraud Section (the âFraud Sectionâ), the United States Attorneyâs Office for the District
of New Jersey (the âOfficeââ), and Alcon Pte Ltd (the âCompanyâ). The Company hereby agrees
and stipulates that the following facts and conclusions of law are true and accurate. The Company
admits, accepts, and acknowledges that it is responsible for the acts of its officers, directors,
employees, and agents as set forth below. Should the Fraud Section and the Office pursue the
prosecution that is deferred by this Agreement, the Company agrees that it will neither contest the
admissibility of, nor contradict, this Statement of Facts in any such proceeding. The following
facts took place during the relevant time period and establish beyond a reasonable doubt the
charges set forth in the Information attached to this Agreement:

Relevant Entities

1. Alcon, Inc. was a multinational eye care company with headquarters in Fort Worth,
Texas, and incorporated in Hiinenberg, Switzerland. In or about April 2011, Alcon, Inc. merged
with Novartis AG, a global pharmaceutical company based in Basel, Switzerland, after which
Alcon, Inc. (hereinafter, the âAlcon Divisionâ) became a wholly owned subsidiary of Novartis
AG. Novartis AGâs American Depository Shares were listed and traded on the New York Stock
Exchange under the symbol âNVS.â Novartis AG was an issuer of publicly traded securities
registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and was required to file

periodic reports with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the âSECâ) under

A-1
Case 2:20-cr-00539-SDW Document 2 Filed 06/25/20 Page 29 of 70 PagelD: 47

Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act. Thus, Novartis AG was an âissuerâ within the meaning
of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (âFCPAâ), 15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78dd-1(a) and 78m(b). The Alcon
Divisionâs books, records, and accounts were included in the consolidated financial statements of
Novartis AG filed with the SEC.

2. In or about April 2019, Novartis AG spun off the Alcon Division, including Alcon
Pte Ltd, and the newly established independent parent company was named Alcon Inc. Alcon Inc.
is the lawful successor-in-interest to Alcon, Inc. (1.e., the Alcon Division).

3. In or about and between 2011 and 2014 (the ârelevant time periodâ), Alcon Pte Ltd
was an affiliate of the Alcon Division with headquarters in Singapore. Among other functions,
Alcon Pte Ltd provided financial services and managerial oversight for the Alcon Divisionâs
operations in Asia, including for two representative offices in Vietnam. Alcon Pte Ltdâs books,
records, and accounts were included in the consolidated financial statements that Novartis AG
filed with the SEC.

4. âDistributor Company,â an entity whose identity is known to the Fraud Section, the
Office, and the Company, was a limited liability company incorporated in Vietnam. Among other
business, Distributor Company marketed and sold Alcon Division products to health care providers
(âHCPsâ) and hospitals in Vietnam.

Relevant Individuals

5. âAlcon Pte Ltd Executive 1,â an individual whose identity is known to the Fraud

Section, the Office, and the Company, was a high level executive of the Company and, at various

times, was located in the United States or Singapore. For fiscal year 2014, Alcon Pte Ltd Executive

A-2
Case 2:20-cr-00539-SDW Document 2 Filed 06/25/20 Page 30 of 70 PagelD: 48

1 signed two Sarbanes-Oxley sub-certifications that were false. These false sub-certifications were
maintained as part of Novartis AGâs books, records, and accounts.

6. âAlcon Pte Ltd Executive 2,â an individual whose identity is known to the Fraud
Section, the Office, and the Company, was an employee of the Company and, at various times,
was located in the United States or Singapore.

7. âDistributor Company Executive 1,â an individual whose identity is known to the
Fraud Section, the Office, and the Company, was a high level executive of Distributor Company
during the relevant time period.

8. âDistributor Company Executive 2,â an individual whose identity is known to the
Fraud Section, the Office, and the Company, was a high level accounting executive of Distributor
Company during the relevant time period.

Operations in Vietnam

9, Vietnam owned and operated state-owned and state-controlled hospitals and
clinics, and these hospitals and clinics performed a government function. Employees of state-
owned and state-controlled hospitals and clinics in Vietnam (âVietnam State HCPsâ) were
âforeign officialsâ within the meaning of the FCPA, 15 U.S.C. Â§ 78dd-3(f)(2)(A).

10. The Alcon Division conducted business operations in Vietnam through two
representative offices located in Hanoi, Vietnam, and Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam (âAlcon
Vietnam Representative Officesâ). The Company provided management and financial reporting
oversight for the Alcon Vietnam Representative Offices.

11. The Alcon Vietnam Representative Offices did not directly conduct sales to end-

customers in Vietnam, including to state-owned and state-controlled hospitals and clinics in

A-3
Case 2:20-cr-00539-SDW Document 2 Filed 06/25/20 Page 31 of 70 PagelD: 49

Vietnam. Rather, sales to end-customers in Vietnam were conducted through Distributor
Company.

12. Among other lines of the Alcon Divisionâs eye care business, the Alcon Vietnam
Representative Offices, through Distributor Company, sold surgical equipment and devices such
as lasers and intraocular lenses (âIOLsâ) to end-customers in Vietnam, including to state-owned
and state-controlled hospitals and clinics in Vietnam. [OLs are artificial replacement lenses that
are implanted in the eye as part of a treatment for a variety of ailments such as cataracts.

Overview of the Conspiracy

13. Beginning in or about 2007, the Alcon Vietnam Representative Offices and
Distributor Company engaged in a scheme to bribe Vietnam State HCPs in order to increase sales
of IOLs. Participants in the scheme referred to it as the âconsultancy program.â

14. Under the guise of the consultancy program, Distributor Company made corrupt
payments to HCPs, including Vietnam State HCPs, in connection with sales of Alcon Division
IOLs by Distributor Company. Distributor Company made the payments directly to HCPs,
including to Vietnam State HCPs, and the Alcon Vietnam Representative Offices, with the
approval of employees of the Company, reimbursed Distributor Company for up to 50 percent of
the costs associated with the improper payments to HCPs.

15. The scheme continued after the Alcon Division merged with Novartis AG in April
2011. Thereafter, between in or about April 2011 and June 2014, the Company, through its
executives, employees, and agents, knowingly and willfully conspired and agreed with others to
cause Novartis AG to maintain false accounting records, by, among other things, falsely recording

partial reimbursements to Distributor Company for improper payments made to Vietnam State

A-4
Case 2:20-cr-00539-SDW Document 2 Filed 06/25/20 Page 32 of 70 PagelD: 50

HCPs in the Companyâs internal financial records, which were consolidated into Novartis AGâs
financial records, and by transmitting false Sarbanes-Oxley sub-certification letters to Novartis
AG. These false sub-certification letters were subsequently maintained in the books, records, and
accounts of Novartis AG.

16. In total, from 2011 through 2014, as a result of the improper payments to Vietnam
State HCPs, the Company realized approximately $8,500,000 in profits.

Details of the Scheme

17. In or around April 2007, prior to Novartis AGâs merger with the Alcon Division,
the Alcon Vietnam Representative Offices, with the knowledge and involvement of Alcon Pte Ltd
Executive 1, an Alcon Vietnam Representative Offices executive, and others, began providing
money to Distributor Company, disguised as consultancy payments and in the form of credit notes,
that Distributor Company used to make corrupt payments to HCPs, including Vietnam State HCPs.

18. In furtherance of the scheme, on or about April 3, 2007, Distributor Company
Executive 2 sent an email to Alcon Pte Ltd Executive 1, an Alcon Vietnam Representative Offices
executive, and others. In the email, Distributor Company Executive 2 referenced a meeting from
March 2007 in which details of the corrupt consultancy program were discussed. The email
attached a list of approximately 35 HCPs, including Vietnam State HCPs, who were designated to
receive payments in exchange for purchasing Alcon Division IOLs. The emailâand other
contemporaneous communicationsâalso outlined a proposal for the consultancy program as
follows:

a. The consultancy program would cover two types of Alcon Division IOLs:

IQ and Restore;

Maea 2 Ofer AOSeGlamMyar Pynacrpmant 2 Ederi AAs/OSieg

oe,

Neg

b. HCPs would be paid 200,000 VND (equivalent to then approximately
$12.50 USD) per IQ IOL purchased and 400,000 VND (equivalent to then approximately $25.00
USD) per Restore IOL purchased;

c. Distributor Company would make the payments to HCPs through bank

transfers; and

d. Alcon Vietnam Representative Offices would reimburse Distributor

Company for up to 50 percent of the costs associated with the consultancy program.

19. The consultancy program targeted doctors and nurses, many of whom were
Vietnam State HCPs. As explained in an attachment to an email from an Alcon Vietnam
Representative Offices executive dated July 21, 2008, the â[t]arget customer[s]â for the scheme

99 66

consisted of the following: â[d]Joctor[s] in the consulta[tion] room,â â[d]octor[s] in the exam

room,â â[n]Jurse[s] in the consulta[tion] room,â and the â[c]hief]s] of [Operating Rooms] inâ two
specific eye hospitals in Vietnam.

20. Furthermore, the purpose of the consultancy program, as explained in an email
dated July 26, 2008 from a Distributor Company employee to an Alcon Vietnam Representative
Offices executive, among others, was to âencourage[] doctors to introduce and use Alconâs IOLs
and... speed up IOLs sales.â

21. Atthe consultancy programâs peak, in or around 2011, Distributor Company made
corrupt payments to approximately 200 HCPs, a number of whom were Vietnam State HCPs, and
the Alcon Vietnam Representative Offices disguised reimbursement for those payments as

legitimate payments made pursuant to the consultancy program. These payments aggregated over

time. For example, during 2010, a proposed payment schedule showed one Vietnam State HCP

A-6
Case 2:20-cr-00539-SDW Document 2 Filed 06/25/20 Page 34 of 70 PagelD: 52

was scheduled to receive more than 360,000,000 VND (equivalent to then approximately $18,450
USD) pursuant to the consultancy program, while another Vietnam State HCP was scheduled to
receive more than 450,000,000 VND (equivalent to then approximately $23,352 USD).

22. Between in or about 2007 and June 2014, the Alcon Vietnam Representative
Offices, with the approval of employees of the Company and others, partially reimbursed
Distributor Company periodically for improper payments that Distributor Company made to
HCPs, including to Vietnam State HCPs (for instance, reimbursing approximately $180,000 USD
in 2010 and up to approximately $100,000 USD in 2013 and 2014).

The False Records

23. Prior to 2012, the Alcon Vietnam Representative Offices partially reimbursed
Distributor Company for improper payments made through the consultancy program by causing
another Alcon entity to issue credits to Distributor Company that offset its outstanding debt
balances. These credits were referred to as âcredit notes.â

24. The typical system for issuing the credit notes included the following steps: (a)
Distributor Company employees would regularly send emails to an Alcon Vietnam Representative
Offices employee requesting a credit note for a certain amount related to the consultancy program;
(b) the Alcon Vietnam Representative Offices employee reviewed and forwarded the requests to
regional management, including Alcon Pte Ltd Executive 2; and (c) once approved by regional
management, credit notes were issued to Distributor Company with the stated reason for the credit
note as âconsultancy fees.â

25. After 2011, Distributor Company, with the knowledge of certain employees of the

Company, continued to make improper payments to HCPs, including to Vietnam State HCPs, in

A-7
o~ aA As oP me OPN PL? ~ ae pty CoN Eee PN
Maea 2 Ofer AOSeGlamMyar Pynacrpmant 2 Ederi AAs/OSieg
Ne TAO TA TA ed oe EAA PER Gn a Pou Aa ASA Pa

oe,

Neg

order to increase sales of Alcon Division IOLs, and the Company continued to reimburse
Distributor Company indirectly for a portion of those payments.

26. Between in or around August 2011 and 2012, the Alcon Vietnam Representative
Offices, with the approval of employees of the Company and others, changed the methodology for
reimbursing Distributor Company for a portion of the improper payments made through the
consultancy program. Specifically, rather than rermburse Distributor Company by issuing credit
notes for âconsultancy fees,â the Alcon Vietnam Representative Offices partially reimbursed
Distributor Company for the payments through other, inflated reimbursable costs, such as
marketing, human resources, or margin reconciliation costs.

27. In furtherance of the scheme, in an email dated August 15, 2011, an Alcon Vietnam
Representative Offices executive wrote to Alcon Pte Ltd Executive 2 and others about continued
financial support for the consultancy program and suggested using Distributor Companyâs margin
in order to cover the consultancy program costs. The email noted that â[Distributor Company
Executive 1] agreed to remain their activities to secure business as much as possible but
[Distributor Company Executive 1] need[s] our support more in term[s] of finance.â In the email,
an Alcon Vietnam Representative Offices executive noted further, âI also discuss[ed] with
[Distributor Company Executive 1] our scenario of increasing the margin to cover USD 120K ..
.With this support, [Distributor Company] will propose the marketing plan for next year for
Alcon|âs] review and agree[ment] before implementation.â

28. Employees of the Company and the Alcon Vietnam Representative Offices also
discussed using a marketing budget to cover the costs of reimbursing Distributor Company in

connection with the improper payments made under the consultancy program. For example, on

November 23, 2011, a Distributor Company employee sent an email to two Alcon Vietnam
Representative Offices executives, among others, summarizing a November 9, 2011 meeting,
during which personnel from Distributor Company and from the Alcon Vietnam Representative
Offices discussed various ways that the consultancy program would operate in 2012. Specifically,
the Distributor Company employee wrote: âConsultant Program in 2012: Alcon will consider and
share the finance difficulties of [Distributor Company] by:

e Increasing the ratio[] share of Loss of exchange rate...

e [Playing sample for [Distributor Company |

e [Using some money from marketing budget to support [Distributor

Company].â

29. Furthermore, during a phone call in or around late summer 2014, Distributor
Company Executive | told an Alcon Pte Ltd employee that Distributor Company had used up all
of its funds to pay for Alcon Divisionâs surgical equipment and could no longer pay the âusual
considerationsâ to Vietnamese HCPs to ensure they purchased Alcon Division products.

30. âIn or around May or June 2014, Alcon Pte Ltd Executive 1 told an Alcon Pte Ltd
employee, who was responsible for reviewing the financials for the Alcon Divisionâs business in
Vietnam, that no one needed to know about Distributor Companyâs 2014 profit and loss analysis
(âDistributor Companyâs P&L Analysisâ).

31. Shortly thereafter, on or about June 11, 2014, an Alcon Vietnam Representative
Offices executive sent an Alcon Pte Ltd employee a copy of Distributor Companyâs P&L Analysis,
which included a number of line 1tems that concealed improper payments to HCPs, including to

Vietnam State HCPs, in FY 2013 and FY 2014, including: purported â[clonsultant costâ of

approximately $111,157 USD for FY 2013, purported â[c]Jonsultant costâ of approximately

$97,000 USD for FY 2014, purported âHRâ cost of approximately $800,000 USD for FY 2013,

approximately $572,000 USD for FY 2014.

32. Together, these entries in Distributor Companyâs P&L Analysis correlated to
ongoing efforts by the Company to conceal the reimbursement of Distributor Company for
improper payments made to Vietnam State HCPs and others.

33. The Company, through its executives, employees, and agents, knowingly and
willfully conspired and agreed with others to falsely record in the Companyâs internal financial
records partial rermbursement of the improper payments that Distributor Company made to HCPs,
including to Vietnam State HCPs, pursuant to the consultancy program. By recording
reimbursements for these payments as legitimate expenses, such as consulting expenses, marketing
expenses, human resource expenses, administration costs, and/or margin reconciliation costs, the
Company, through its executives, employees, and agents, concealed the true nature of these
payments and caused Novartis AG to maintain false financial records.

34. Furthermore, as part of the conspiracy, Alcon Pte Ltd Executive 1, who participated
in the scheme and knew of the corrupt payments to Vietnam State HCPs, signed and transmitted
two false Sarbanes-Oxley sub-certification letters dated July 4, 2014, and October 7, 2014, to the
Alcon Divisionâs Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. These false sub-
certification letters were subsequently maintained in the books, records, and accounts of Novartis

AG.

REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
Alcon Inc. agrees that it will report to the Fraud Section and the Office periodically, at no

less than twelve-month intervals during a three-year term, regarding remediation and
implementation of the compliance program and internal controls, policies, and procedures
described in Attachment C. During this three-year period, Alcon Inc. shall: (1) conduct an initial
review and submit an initial report, and (2) conduct and prepare at least two follow-up reviews
and reports, as described below:

a. By no later than one year from the date this Agreement is executed, Alcon
Inc. shall submit to the Fraud Section and the Office a written report setting forth a complete
description of its remediation efforts to date, its proposals reasonably designed to improve Alcon
Inc.âs internal controls, policies, and procedures for ensuring compliance with the FCPA and
other applicable anti-corruption laws, and the proposed scope of the subsequent reviews. The
report shall be transmitted to Chief, FCPA Unit, Fraud Section, Criminal Division, U.S.
Department of Justice, 1400 New York Avenue, NW, Bond Building, 11th Floor, Washington,
D.C. 20530 and Chief, Health Care Fraud Unit, United States Attorneyâs Office for the District
of New Jersey, 970 Broad Street, 7th Floor, Newark, New Jersey 07102. Alcon Inc. may extend
the time period for issuance of the report with prior written approval of the Fraud Section.

b. Alcon Inc. shall undertake at least two follow-up reviews and reports,

reasonably designed to detect and prevent violations of the FCPA and other applicable anti-
corruption laws.

C. The first follow-up review and report shall be completed by no later than
one year after the initial report is submitted to the Fraud Section and the Office. The second
follow-up review and report shall be completed and delivered to the Fraud Section and the Office
no later than thirty days before the end of the Term.

d. The reports will likely include proprietary, financial, confidential, and
competitive business information. Moreover, public disclosure of the reports could discourage
cooperation, impede pending or potential government investigations and thus undermine the
objectives of the reporting requirement. For these reasons, among others, the reports and the
contents thereof are intended to remain and shall remain non-public, except as otherwise agreed
to by the parties in writing, or except to the extent that the Fraud Section and the Office
determine in their sole discretion that disclosure would be in furtherance of the Fraud Sectionâs
and the Officeâs discharge of their duties and responsibilities or is otherwise required by law.

e. Alcon Inc. may extend the time period for submission of any of the

follow-up reports with prior written approval of the Fraud Section and the Office.

GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

 

Relevant Statutory Background

1. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, 15 U.S.C.
Â§Â§ 78dd-1, et seq. (the âFCPAâ), was enacted by Congress for the purpose of, among
other things, making it unlawful to act corruptly in furtherance of an offer, promise,
authorization, or payment of money or anything of value, directly or indirectly, to a
foreign official for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business for, or directing
business to, any person. Pertinent to this charge, the FCPAâs accounting provisions,
among other things, require every issuer of publicly traded securities registered
pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. Â§ 781, or
required to file periodic reports with the United States Securities and Exchange

Commission (âSECâ) under Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C Â§

reflect transactions and the distribution of the companyâs assets, and prohibit the
knowing and willful falsification of an issuerâs books, records, or accounts. 15 U.S.C.

12. The Alcon Vietnam Representative Offices did not directly
conduct sales to end-customers in Vietnam, including to state-owned and state-
controlled hospitals and clinics in Vietnam. Rather, sales to end-customers in
Vietnam were conducted through the Distributor Company.

13. Among other lines of the Alcon Divisionâs eye care business, the
Alcon Vietnam Representative Offices, through the Distributor Company, sold
surgical equipment and devices such as lasers and intraocular lenses (âIOLsâ) to end-
customers in Vietnam, including to state-owned and state-controlled hospitals and
clinics in Vietnam. IOLs are artificial replacement lenses that are implanted in the
eye as part of a treatment for a variety of ailments, such as cataracts.

Overview of the Conspiracy

 

14. Beginning in or about 2007, the Alcon Vietnam Representative
Offices and the Distributor Company engaged in a scheme to bribe Vietnam State
HCPs in order to increase sales of LOLs. Participants in the scheme referred to it as
the âconsultancy program.â

15. Under the guise of the consultancy program, the Distributor
Company made corrupt payments to HCPs, including Vietnam State HCPs, in
connection with sales of Alcon Division IOLs by the Distributor Company. The
Distributor Company made the payments directly to HCPs, including to Vietnam

State HCPs. The Alcon Vietnam Representative Offices, with the approval of
Case 2:20-cr-00539-SDW Document 2 Filed 06/25/20 Page 58 of 70 PagelD: 76

employees of ALCON PTE LTD, reimbursed the Distributor Company for up to 50
percent of the costs associated with the improper payments to HCPs.

16. The scheme continued after the Alcon Division merged with
Novartis AG in or about April 2011. Thereafter, between in or about April 2011 and
in or about June 2014, ALCON PTE LTD, through its executives, employees, and
agents, knowingly and willfully conspired and agreed with others to cause Novartis
AG to maintain false accounting records, by, among other things, falsely recording
partial reimbursements to the Distributor Company for improper payments made to
Vietnam State HCPs in ALCON PTE LTDâs internal financial records, which were
consolidated into Novartis AGâs financial records, and by transmitting false
Sarbanes-Oxley sub-certification letters to Novartis AG. These false sub-certification
letters were subsequently maintained in the books, records, and accounts of Novartis
AG.

17. In total, from in or about 2011 through in or about 2014, as a
result of the improper payments to Vietnam State HCPs, ALCON PTE LTD realized
approximately $8,500,000 in profits.

Details of the Scheme

 

18. In or about April 2007, prior to Novartis AGâs merger with the
Alcon Division, the Alcon Vietnam Representative Offices, with the knowledge and
involvement of Alcon Pte Ltd Executive 1, an Alcon Vietnam Representative Offices
executive, and others, began providing money to the Distributor Company, disguised

as consultancy payments and in the form of credit notes, that the Distributor
Company used to make corrupt payments to HCPs, including Vietnam State HCPs.

19. In furtherance of the scheme, on or about April 3, 2007,
Distributor Company Executive 2 sent an email to Alcon Pte Ltd Executive 1, an
Alcon Vietnam Representative Offices executive, and others. In the email, Distributor
Company Executive 2 referenced a meeting from March 2007 in which details of the
corrupt consultancy program were discussed. The email attached a list of
approximately 35 HCPs, including Vietnam State HCPs, who were designated to
receive payments in exchange for purchasing Alcon Division I[OLs. The emailâand
other contemporaneous communicationsâalso outlined a proposal for the
consultancy program as follows:

a. The consultancy program would cover two types of Alcon
Division [OLs: IQ and Restore;

b. HCPs would be paid 200,000 VND (then equivalent to
approximately $12.50) per IQ IOL purchased and 400,000 VND (then equivalent to
approximately $25.00) per Restore IOL purchased;

C. The Distributor Company would make the payments to
HCPs through bank transfers; and

d. Alcon Vietnam Representative Offices would reimburse
Distributor Company for up to 50 percent of the costs associated with the consultancy

program.

Rat At Pd a YY EAA PER Gn a PRINS AA Askar cae â¬

20. The consultancy program targeted doctors and nurses, many of
whom were Vietnam State HCPs. As explained in an attachment to an email from an
Alcon Vietnam Representative Offices executive dated July 21, 2008, the â[t]arget

9?

customer|s]â for the scheme consisted of the following: â[dJoctor[s] in the
consulta[tion] room,â â[d]octor[s] in the exam room,â â[n]urse[s] in the consulta|[tion]
room,â and the â[c]hief[s] of [Operating Rooms] inâ two specific eye hospitals in
Vietnam.

21. Furthermore, the purpose of the consultancy program, as
explained in an email dated July 26, 2008, from a Distributor Company employee to
an Alcon Vietnam Representative Offices executive, among others, was to
âencourage|] doctors to introduce and use Alconâs IOLs and. . . speed up IOLs sales.â

22. At the consultancy programâs peak, in or about 2011, the
Distributor Company made corrupt payments to approximately 200 HCPs, a number
of whom were Vietnam State HCPs, and the Alcon Vietnam Representative Offices
disguised reimbursement for those payments as legitimate payments made pursuant
to the consultancy program. These payments aggregated over time. For example,
during 2010, a proposed payment schedule showed one Vietnam State HCP was
scheduled to receive more than 360,000,000 VND (then equivalent to approximately
$18,450) pursuant to the consultancy program, while another Vietnam State HCP

was scheduled to receive more than 450,000,000 VND (then equivalent to

approximately $23,352).

23. Between in or about 2007 and in or about June 2014, the Alcon
Vietnam Representative Offices, with the approval of employees of ALCON PTE LTD
and others, partially reimbursed the Distributor Company periodically for improper
payments that the Distributor Company made to HCPs, including to Vietnam State
HCPs (for instance, reimbursing approximately $180,000 in or about 2010 and up to
approximately $100,000 in or about 2013 and 2014).

The False Records

 

24. Prior to in or about 2012, the Alcon Vietnam Representative
Offices partially reimbursed the Distributor Company for improper payments made
through the consultancy program by causing another Alcon entity to issue credits to
the Distributor Company that offset its outstanding debt balances. These credits were
referred to as âcredit notes.â

25. The typical system for issuing the credit notes included the
following steps: (a) Distributor Company employees would regularly send emails to
an Alcon Vietnam Representative Offices employee requesting a credit note for a
certain amount related to the consultancy program; (b) the Alcon Vietnam
Representative Offices employee reviewed and forwarded the requests to regional
management, including Alcon Pte Ltd Executive 2; and (c) once approved by regional
management, credit notes were issued to the Distributor Company with the stated

reason for the credit note as âconsultancy fees.â

26. After 2011, the Distributor Company, with the knowledge of
certain employees of ALCON PTE LTD, continued to make improper payments to
HCPs, including to Vietnam State HCPs, in order to increase sales of Alcon Division
IOLs, and ALCON PTE LTD continued to reimburse the Distributor Company
indirectly for a portion of those payments.

27. Between in or about August 2011 and in or about 2012, the Alcon
Vietnam Representative Offices, with the approval of employees of ALCON PTE LTD
and others, changed the methodology for reimbursing the Distributor Company for a
portion of the improper payments made through the consultancy program.
Specifically, rather than reimburse the Distributor Company by issuing credit notes
for âconsultancy fees,â the Alcon Vietnam Representative Offices partially
reimbursed the Distributor Company for the payments through other, inflated
reimbursable costs, such as marketing, human resources, or margin reconciliation
costs.

28. In furtherance of the scheme, in an email dated August 15, 2011,
an Alcon Vietnam Representative Offices executive wrote to Alcon Pte Ltd Executive
2 and others about continued financial support for the consultancy program and
suggested using the Distributor Companyâs margin in order to cover the consultancy
program costs. The email noted that â[Distributor Company Executive 1] agreed to
remain their activities to secure business as much as possible but [Distributor
Company Executive 1] need[s] our support more in term|s] of finance.â In the email,

an Alcon Vietnam Representative Offices executive noted further, âI also discuss[ed]
with [Distributor Company Executive 1] our scenario of increasing the margin to
cover USD 120K ... With this support, [the Distributor Company] will propose the
marketing plan for next year for Alcon|âs] review and agree[ment] before
implementation.â

29. Employees of ALCON PTE LTD and the Alcon Vietnam
Representative Offices also discussed using a marketing budget to cover the costs of
reimbursing Distributor Company in connection with the improper payments made
under the consultancy program. For example, on or about November 23, 2011, a
Distributor Company employee sent an email to two Alcon Vietnam Representative
Offices executives, among others, summarizing a November 9, 2011 meeting, during
which personnel from the Distributor Company and from the Alcon Vietnam
Representative Offices discussed various ways that the consultancy program would
operate in 2012. Specifically, the Distributor Company employee wrote: âConsultant
Program in 2012: Alcon will consider and share the finance difficulties of [Distributor
Company] by:

e Increasing the ratio[| share of Loss of exchange rate...

e [Playing sample for [Distributor Company]

e [U]sing some money from marketing budget to support
[Distributor Company].â

30. Furthermore, during a phone call in or about late summer 2014,

Distributor Company Executive 1 told an Alcon Pte Ltd employee that the Distributor

a

Company had used up all of its funds to pay for Alcon Divisionâs surgical equipment
and could no longer pay the âusual considerationsâ to Vietnamese HCPs to ensure
they purchased Alcon Division products.

31.  Inor about May or June 2014, Alcon Pte Ltd Executive 1 told an
Alcon Pte Ltd employee, who was responsible for reviewing the financials for the
Alcon Divisionâs business in Vietnam, that no one needed to know about the
Distributor Companyâs 2014 profit and loss analysis (âDistributor Companyâs P&L
Analysisâ).

32. Shortly thereafter, on or about June 11, 2014, an Alcon Vietnam
Representative Offices executive sent an Alcon Pte Ltd employee a copy of the
Distributor Companyâs P&L Analysis, which included a number of line items that
concealed improper payments to HCPs, including to Vietnam State HCPs, in fiscal
year (âFYâ) 2013 and FY 2014, including: purported â[c]onsultant costâ of
approximately $111,157 for FY 2013, purported â[c]onsultant costâ of approximately
$97,000 for FY 2014, purported âHRâ cost of approximately $800,000 for FY 2013,
purported âHRâ cost of approximately $740,000 for FY 2014, purported
âlajdministration costâ of approximately $514,000 for FY 2013, and purported
âla]dministration costâ of approximately $572,000 for FY 2014.

33. Together, these entries in the Distributor Companys P&L

Analysis correlated to ongoing efforts by ALCON PTE LTD to conceal the

reimbursement of the Distributor Company for improper payments made to Vietnam
State HCPs and others.

34. ALCON PTE LTD, through its executives, employees, and agents,
knowingly and willfully conspired and agreed with others to falsely record in ALCON
PTE LTDâs internal financial records partial reimbursement of the improper
payments that the Distributor Company made to HCPs, including to Vietnam State
HCPs, pursuant to the consultancy program. By recording reimbursements for these
payments as legitimate expenses, such as consulting expenses, marketing expenses,
human resource expenses, administration costs, and/or margin reconciliation costs,
ALCON PTE LTD, through its executives, employees, and agents, concealed the true
nature of these payments and caused Novartis AG to maintain false financial records.

35. Furthermore, as part of the conspiracy, Alcon Pte Ltd Executive
1, who participated in the scheme and knew of the corrupt payments to Vietnam State
HCPs, signed and transmitted two false Sarbanes-Oxley sub-certification letters
dated July 4, 2014, and October 7, 2014, to the Alcon Divisionâs Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer. These false sub-certification letters were

subsequently maintained in the books, records, and accounts of Novartis AG.

financial records, and by transmitting false Sarbanes-Oxley sub-certification
letters to Novartis AG, which caused Novartis AG to maintain false accounting
