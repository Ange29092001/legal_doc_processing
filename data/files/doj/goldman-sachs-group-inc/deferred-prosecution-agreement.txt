DEFERRED PROSECUTION AGREEMENT

The defendant The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (the âCompanyâ), pursuant to authority
granted by the Companyâs Board of Directors, reflected in Attachment B, and the United States
Department of Justice, Criminal Division, Fraud Section and Money Laundering and Asset
Recovery Section, and the United States Attorneyâs Office for the Eastern District of New York
(collectively the âOfficesâ), enter into this deferred prosecution agreement (the âAgreementâ.

Criminal Information and Acceptance of Responsibility

1. The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Offices will file the attached one-
count criminal information (the âInformationâ) in the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of New York charging the Company with one count of conspiracy to commit offenses
against the United States, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 371, that is, to
violate the anti-bribery provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (âFCPAâ), as

amended, see Title 15, United States Code, Sections 78dd-1, 78dd-2 and 78dd-3. In so doing, the
Company: (a) knowingly waives its right to indictment on these charges, as well as all rights to a
speedy trial pursuant to the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, Title 18, United
States Code, Section 3161, and Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 48(b); and (b) knowingly
waives any objection with respect to venue to any charges by the United States arising out of the
conduct described in the Statement of Facts attached hereto as Attachment A (the âStatement of
Factsâ) and consents to the filing of the Information, as provided under the terms of this
Agreement, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The Offices
agree to defer prosecution of the Company pursuant to the terms and conditions described below.

2. The Company admits, accepts, and acknowledges that it is responsible under United
States law for the acts of its officers, directors, employees, and agents as charged in the
Information, and as set forth in the Statement of Facts, and that the allegations described in the
Information and the facts described in the Statement of Facts are true and accurate. Should the
Offices pursue the prosecution that is deferred by this Agreement, the Company stipulates to the
admissibility of the Statement of Facts in any proceeding by the Offices, including any trial, guilty
plea, or sentencing proceeding, and will not contradict anything in the Statement of Facts at any
such proceeding. The Company agrees that, effective as of the date the Company signs this
Agreement, in any prosecution that is deferred by this Agreement, it will not dispute the Statement
of Facts set forth in this Agreement, and, in any such prosecution, the Statement of Facts shall be
admissible as: (a) substantive evidence offered by the government in its case-in-chief and rebuttal
case; (b) impeachment evidence offered by the government on cross-examination; and (c) evidence
at any sentencing hearing or other hearing. In addition, in connection therewith, the Company

agrees not to assert any claim under the United States Constitution, Rule 410 of the Federal Rules

2
of Evidence, Rule 11(f) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, Section 1B1.1(a) of the United
States Sentencing Guidelines (âUSSGâ or âSentencing Guidelinesâ), or any other federal rule that
the Statement of Facts should be suppressed or is otherwise inadmissible as evidence in any form.
Term of the Agreement

3. This Agreement is effective for a period beginning on the date on which the
Information is filed and ending three (3) years from that date (the âTermââ). The Company agrees,
however, that, in the event the Offices determine, in their sole discretion, that the Company has
knowingly violated any provision of this Agreement or has failed to completely perform or fulfill
each of the Companyâs obligations under this Agreement, an extension or extensions of the Term
may be imposed by the Offices, in their sole discretion, for up to a total additional time period of
one year, without prejudice to the Officesâ right to proceed as provided in Paragraphs 17-20 below.
Any extension of the Agreement extends all terms of this Agreement, including the terms of the
reporting requirement in Attachment D (Corporate Compliance Reporting), for an equivalent
period. Conversely, in the event the Offices find, in their sole discretion, that there exists a change
in circumstances sufficient to eliminate the need for the reporting requirement in Attachment D,
and that the other provisions of this Agreement have been satisfied, the Agreement may be
terminated early. If the Court refuses to grant exclusion of time under the Speedy Trial Act, 18
U.S.C. Â§ 3161(h)(2), the Term shall be deemed to have not begun and all the provisions of the
Agreement shall be deemed null and void, except that the statute of limitations for any prosecution
relating to the conduct described in the Statement of Facts shall be tolled from the date on which
this Agreement was signed until the date the Court refuses to grant the exclusion of time plus six

months. In addition, if Goldman Sachs (Malaysia) Sdn. Bhd. (âGoldman Malaysiaâ) later is
permitted to withdraw its plea of guilty, this Agreement shall be deemed null and void, except that
the statute of limitations for any prosecution relating to the conduct described in the Statement of
Facts shall be tolled from the date on which this Agreement is signed until six months following
the date on which the plea of guilty is subsequently withdrawn.
Relevant Considerations
4, The Offices enter into this Agreement based on the individual facts and
circumstances presented by this case and the Company, including:

a. the Company did not receive voluntary disclosure credit pursuant to the
FCPA Corporate Enforcement Policy in the Department of Justice Manual (âJMâ) 9-47.120, or
pursuant to the Sentencing Guidelines, because it did not voluntarily and timely self-disclose to
the Offices the conduct described in the Statement of Facts;

b. the Company received partial credit for its cooperation with the Officesâ
investigation of the underlying conduct, including: collecting and producing voluminous evidence
located in other countries; making regular factual presentations and investigative updates to the
Offices; and voluntarily making foreign-based employees available for interviews in the United
States;

C. the Company did not receive full credit for its cooperation because the
Company was significantly delayed in producing relevant evidence, including recorded phone
calls in which the Companyâs bankers, executives, and control functions personnel discussed
allegations of bribery and misconduct relating to the conduct set forth in the Statement of Facts;

d. the Company ultimately provided to the Offices all relevant facts known to

it, including information about the individuals involved in the misconduct;

4
e. the Companyâs wholly-owned subsidiary, Goldman Malaysia, is pleading
guilty pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C) to one count of conspiracy to
commit offenses against the United States, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section
371, that is, to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA, as amended, Title 15, United States
Code, Sections 78dd-1 and 78dd-3;

f. the Company ultimately engaged in remedial measures, including (1)
implementing heightened controls and additional procedures and policies relating to electronic
surveillance and investigation, due diligence on proposed transactions or clients and the use of
third-party intermediaries across business units; and (11) enhancing anti-corruption training for all
management and relevant employees;

g. the Company has committed to continuing to enhance its compliance
program and internal controls, including ensuring that its compliance program satisfies the
minimum elements set forth in Attachment C to this Agreement (Corporate Compliance Program);

h. based on the Companyâs remediation and the state of its compliance
program, and the Companyâs agreement to report to the Offices as set forth in Attachment D, the
Offices determined that an independent compliance monitor is unnecessary;

1. the nature and seriousness of the offense conduct, including, among other
things: the amount of bribes; the level and number of the foreign officials bribed; the duration of
the scheme; the resulting illicit gains to and increased stature in the region for the Company from
the deals, which were significant to the Company and key to the divisions of the Company in

which the deals occurred;
j. the pervasiveness of the misconduct within the Company, including that
high-level employees within the Companyâs investment bank were involved in the misconduct
described in the Statement of Facts and others ignored significant red flags;

k. the Company has agreed, concurrent with this resolution, to resolve
additional investigations relating to the conduct described in the Statement of Facts, including by
entering into a Consent Order with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the
âthe Fedâ) pursuant to which it will pay a civil money penalty of $154 million; by settling an
Administrative Action filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the âSECâ) and
agreeing to pay $606 million in disgorgement and a civil monetary penalty of $400 million; by
entering into a Consent Order with the New York State Department of Financial Services (the
âDFSâ) pursuant to which it will agree to pay a civil money penalty of $150 million; by resolving
the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authorityâs and Prudential Regulation Authorityâs (the
âUK FCA and PRAâ) investigations and paying a civil penalty to each of $63 million (for a total
of $126 million); by resolving the investigation by the Attorney-Generalâs Chambers of the
Republic of Singapore (the âSingapore AGCâ) pursuant to which it will pay $122 million; by
resolving the investigation of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (the âSingapore MASâ); by
resolving with the Commercial Affairs Department of the Singapore Police Force (the âSingapore
CADâ); and by resolving the investigation by the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission
(the âHong Kong SFCâ) pursuant to which it will pay $350 million;

I. the Company has no prior criminal history; and

m. the Company has agreed to continue to cooperate with the Officesâ ongoing

investigation of individuals and other entities, including as described in Paragraph 5 below.
n. Accordingly, after considering (a) through (m) above, the Offices believe
that the appropriate resolution in this case is a deferred prosecution agreement with the Company;
a criminal monetary penalty of $2,315,088,000, which reflects an aggregate discount of ten (10)
percent off of the bottom of the otherwise-applicable Sentencing Guidelines fine range for the
FCPA conduct; disgorgement of $606 million; and a guilty plea by Goldman Malaysia.

Future Cooperation and Disclosure Requirements

5. The Company shall cooperate fully with the Offices in any and all matters relating
to the conduct described in this Agreement and the Statement of Facts and other conduct under
investigation by the Offices at any time during the Term, subject to applicable laws and
regulations, until the later of the date upon which all investigations and prosecutions arising out of
such conduct are concluded, or the end of the Term. At the request of the Offices, the Company
shall also cooperate fully with other domestic or foreign law enforcement and regulatory
authorities and agencies, as well as the Multilateral Development Banks (âMDBsâ), in any
investigation of the Company, its branches, representative offices, subsidiaries or its affiliates, or
any of its present or former officers, directors, employees, agents, and consultants, or any other
party, in any and all matters relating to the conduct described in this Agreement and the Statement
of Facts. The Companyâs cooperation pursuant to this Paragraph is subject to applicable laws and
regulations, including relevant data privacy and national security laws and regulations, as well as
valid claims of attorney-client privilege or attorney work product doctrine; however, the Company
must provide to the Offices a log of any information or cooperation that is not provided based on

an assertion of law, regulation, or privilege, and the Company bears the burden of establishing the
validity of any such assertion. The Company agrees that its cooperation pursuant to this Paragraph
shall include, but not be limited to, the following:

a. The Company shall truthfully disclose all factual information with respect
to its activities, those of its branches, representative offices, subsidiaries and affiliates, and those
of its present and former directors, officers, employees, agents, and consultants, including any
evidence or allegations and internal or external investigations, about which the Company has any
knowledge or about which the Offices may inquire. This obligation of truthful disclosure includes,
but is not limited to, the obligation of the Company to provide to the Offices, upon request, any
document, record, or other tangible evidence about which the Offices may inquire of the Company.

b. Upon request of the Offices, the Company shall designate knowledgeable
employees, agents, or attorneys to provide to the Offices the information and materials described
in Paragraph 5(a) above on behalf of the Company. It is further understood that the Company
must at all times provide complete, truthful, and accurate information.

C. The Company shall use its best efforts to make available for interviews or
testimony, as requested by the Offices, present or former officers, directors, employees, agents and
consultants of the Company. This obligation includes, but is not limited to, sworn testimony before
a federal grand jury, in federal trials or at any other proceeding, all meetings requested by the
Offices, and interviews with domestic or foreign law enforcement and regulatory authorities.
Cooperation under this Paragraph shall include identification of witnesses who, to the knowledge
of the Company, may have material information regarding the matters being investigated or

prosecuted.
d. With respect to any information, testimony, documents, records, or other
tangible evidence provided to the Offices pursuant to this Agreement, the Company consents to
any and all disclosures, subject to applicable laws and regulations, to other governmental
authorities, including United States authorities and those of a foreign government, as well as the
MDBs, of such materials as the Offices, in their sole discretion, shall deem appropriate.

6. In addition to the obligations in Paragraph 5, during the Term, should the Company
learn of any evidence or allegation of conduct that may constitute a violation of the money
laundering laws that involve the employees or agents of the Company, or should the Company
learn of any evidence or allegation of conduct that may constitute a violation of the FCPAâs anti-
bribery or accounting provisions had the conduct occurred within the jurisdiction of the United
States, the Company shall promptly report such evidence or allegation to the Offices.

Payment of Monetary Penalty

7. The Offices and the Company agree that application of the Sentencing Guidelines

to determine the applicable fine range yields the following analysis:
a. The 2018 USSG are applicable to this matter.

b. Offense Level. Based upon USSG Â§ 2C1.1, the total offense level is 48, calculated

as follows:

(a)(2) Base Offense Level 12
(b)(1) Multiple Bribes +2
(b)(2) Value of benefit received more than $550,000,000 +30
(b)(3) High-Level Official Involved +4
TOTAL 48
c. Base Fine. Based upon USSG Â§ 8C2.4(a)(3), the base fine is $1,607,700,000 (value
of the unlawful payments, pursuant to Â§ 2C1.1(d)(1)).

d. Culpability Score. Based upon USSG Â§ 8C2.5, the culpability score is 8, calculated
as follows:

(a) Base Culpability Score 5
(b)(1) the organization had 5,000 or more employees and

an individual within high-level personnel of the
organization participated in, condoned, or was

willfully ignorant of the offense +5
(g)(2) Cooperation, Acceptance -2
TOTAL 8

e. Calculation of Fine Range:

 

Base Fine $1,607,700,000

Multipliers 1.6 (min)/3.2 (max)

Fine Range $2,572,320,000 to $5,144,640,000
8. The Offices and the Company agree, based on the application of the Sentencing

Guidelines to the misconduct, that the appropriate disgorgement is $606 million (the
âDisgorgement Amountâ) and the total monetary penalty is $2,315,088,000 (the âTotal Criminal
Penaltyâ), $500,000 of which will be paid as a criminal fine by Goldman Malaysia pursuant to its
plea agreement entered into simultaneously herewith. The Total Criminal Penalty reflects a ten
(10) percent discount off the bottom of the applicable U.S.S.G. fine range for the Companyâs
cooperation. The Company and the Offices further agree that the Company will pay the United

States $1,263,088,000, $500,000 of which will be paid as a criminal fine by Goldman Malaysia,

10
to the United States Treasury within ten business days of the sentencing hearing by the Court of
Goldman Malaysia in connection with its plea agreement entered into simultaneously herewith.
9. The Offices agree to credit the remaining amount of the Total Criminal Penalty
against the amount the Company pays to the SEC, Fed, DFS, UK FCA and PRA, Singapore AGC,
Singapore CAD and Hong Kong SFC. The Offices will credit the entire penalty amount that the
Company pays to the SEC, Fed, DFS, UK FCA and PRA, Singapore AGC and Singapore CAD,
as well as $100 million of the penalty the Company pays to Hong Kong SFC, in connection with
parallel resolutions entered into between the Company and those authorities. The Companyâs
payment obligations to the United States under the Agreement will be complete upon the total
payment of $1,263,088,000, so long as the Company pays the remaining amount of the Total
Criminal Penalty to the SEC, Fed, DFS, UK FCA and PRA, Singapore AGC and Hong Kong SFC,
by the end of one year from the beginning of the Term. Should any amount of such payments to
these authorities not be made by the end of one year from the beginning of the Term, or be returned
to the Company or any affiliated entity for any reason, the remaining balance of the Total Criminal
Penalty will be paid to the United States Treasury. The Offices further agree to credit the
Disgorgement Amount against any amount equal or greater to the Disgorgement Amount that the
Company pays to authorities in Malaysia in connection with the conduct detailed in the Statement
of Facts, if paid within one year from the beginning of the Term. Should the Company not pay
the full Disgorgement Amount to Malaysia by one year from the beginning of the Term, or should
all or a portion of the Disgorgement Amount be returned to the Company or any affiliated entity

for any reason, the remaining balance of the Disgorgement Amount will be paid to the United

1]
States Treasury, except that the Offices agree to credit any part of this amount that is paid to the
SEC as disgorgement.

10. The Company and the Offices agree that the Total Criminal Penalty and the
Disgorgement Amount are appropriate given the facts and circumstances of this case, including
the Relevant Considerations described in Paragraph 4 of this Agreement. The Total Criminal
Penalty is final and shall not be refunded. Furthermore, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed
an agreement by the Offices that the Total Criminal Penalty is the maximum penalty that may be
imposed in any future prosecution, and the Offices are not precluded from arguing in any future
prosecution that the Court should impose a higher fine, although the Offices agree that under those
circumstances, it will recommend to the Court that any amount paid under this Agreement should
be offset against any fine the Court imposes as part of a future judgment. The Company
acknowledges that no tax deduction may be sought in connection with the payment of any part of
the Total Criminal Penalty. The Company shall not seek or accept directly or indirectly
reimbursement or indemnification from any source with regard to the Total Criminal Penalty or
the Disgorgement Amount that the Company pays pursuant to this Agreement or any other
agreement entered into with an enforcement authority or regulator concerning the facts set forth in
the Statement of Facts.

Conditional Release from Liability

11. Subject to Paragraphs 17-20, the Offices agree, except as provided in this
Agreement and in the plea agreement between the Offices and Goldman Malaysia dated October
22, 2020, that they will not bring any criminal or civil case against the Company or any of its

branches, representative offices or direct or indirect affiliates, subsidiaries, or joint ventures,

12
relating to any of the conduct described in the Statement of Facts or the criminal Information filed
pursuant to this Agreement. The Offices, however, may use any information related to the conduct
described in the Statement of Facts against the Company: (a) in a prosecution for perjury or
obstruction of justice; (b) in a prosecution for making a false statement; (c) in a prosecution or
other proceeding relating to any crime of violence; or (d) in a prosecution or other proceeding
relating to a violation of any provision of Title 26 of the United States Code.

a. This Agreement does not provide any protection against prosecution for any
future conduct by the Company or any of its branches, representative offices or direct or indirect
affiliates, subsidiaries, or joint ventures.

b. In addition, this Agreement does not provide any protection against
prosecution of any individuals, regardless of their affiliation with the Company.

Corporate Compliance Program

12. The Company represents that it has implemented and will continue to implement a
compliance and ethics program designed to prevent and detect violations of the FCPA and other
applicable anti-corruption laws or money laundering laws throughout its operations, including
those of its branches, representative offices, subsidiaries, agents, and joint ventures, and those of
its contractors and subcontractors whose responsibilities include interacting with foreign officials
or other activities carrying a high risk of corruption, including, but not limited to, the minimum
elements set forth in Attachment C.

13. In order to address any deficiencies in its internal accounting controls, policies, and
procedures, the Company represents that it has undertaken, and will continue to undertake in the

future, in a manner consistent with all of its obligations under this Agreement, a review of its

13
existing internal accounting controls, policies, and procedures, regarding compliance with the
FCPA and other applicable anti-corruption laws. Where necessary and appropriate, the Company
agrees to modify or maintain its existing compliance program, including internal controls,
compliance policies, and procedures in order to ensure that it maintains: (a) an effective system of
internal accounting controls designed to ensure the making and keeping of fair and accurate books,
records, and accounts; and (b) a rigorous anti-corruption compliance program that incorporates
relevant internal accounting controls, as well as policies and procedures designed to effectively
detect and deter violations of the FCPA and other applicable anti-corruption laws. The compliance
program, including the internal accounting controls system, will include, but not be limited to, the
minimum elements set forth in Attachment C.
Corporate Compliance Reporting

14. The Company agrees that it will report to the Offices annually during the Term
regarding remediation and implementation of the compliance measures described in Attachment
C. These reports will be prepared in accordance with Attachment D.

Deferred Prosecution

15. In consideration of the undertakings agreed to by the Company herein, the Offices
agree that any prosecution of the Company for the conduct set forth in the Statement of Facts be
and hereby is deferred for the Term, except as provided in the plea agreement between the Offices
and Goldman Malaysia, dated October 22, 2020. To the extent there is conduct disclosed by the
Company that is not set forth in the Statement of Facts, such conduct will not be exempt from

further prosecution and is not within the scope of or relevant to this Agreement.

14
16. The Offices further agree that if the Company fully complies with all of its
obligations under this Agreement, the Offices will not continue the criminal prosecution against
the Company described in Paragraph 1 and, at the conclusion of the Term, this Agreement shall
expire. Within six months of the Agreementâs expiration, the Offices shall seek dismissal with
prejudice of the criminal Information filed against the Company described in Paragraph 1, and
agree not to file charges in the future against the Company based on the conduct described in this
Agreement and the Statement of Facts. If, however, the Offices determine during this six-month
period that the Company breached the Agreement during the Term, as described in Paragraph 17,
the Officesâ ability to extend the Term, as described in Paragraph 3, or to pursue other remedies,
including those described in Paragraphs 17-20, remains in full effect.

Breach of the Agreement

17. If, during the Term, the Company (a) commits any felony under U.S. federal law;
(b) provides in connection with this Agreement deliberately false, incomplete, or misleading
information, including in connection with its disclosure of information about individual
culpability; (c) fails to cooperate as set forth in Paragraphs 5 and 6 of this Agreement; (d) fails to
implement a compliance program as set forth in Paragraphs 12 and 13 of this Agreement and
Attachment C; (e) commits any act that, had it occurred within the jurisdictional reach of the
FCPA, would be a violation of the FCPA; or (f) otherwise fails to completely perform or fulfill
each of the Companyâs obligations under the Agreement, regardless of whether the Offices become
aware of such a breach after the Term is complete, the Company shall thereafter be subject to
prosecution for any federal criminal violation of which the Offices have knowledge, including, but

not limited to, the charges in the Information described in Paragraph 1, which may be pursued by

15
the Offices in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York or any other appropriate
venue. Determination of whether the Company has breached the Agreement and whether to pursue
prosecution of the Company shall be in the Officesâ sole discretion. Any such prosecution may be
premised on information provided by the Company or its personnel. Any such prosecution relating
to the conduct described in the Statement of Facts or relating to conduct known to the Offices prior
to the date on which this Agreement was signed that is not time-barred by the applicable statute of
limitations on the date of the signing of this Agreement may be commenced against the Company,
notwithstanding the expiration of the statute of limitations, between the signing of this Agreement
and the expiration of the Term plus one year. Thus, by signing this Agreement, the Company
agrees that the statute of limitations with respect to any such prosecution that is not time-barred on
the date of the signing of this Agreement shall be tolled for the Term plus one year. In addition,
the Company agrees that the statute of limitations as to any violation of federal law that occurs
during the Term will be tolled from the date upon which the violation occurs until the earlier of
the date upon which the Offices are made aware of the violation or the duration of the Term plus
five years, and that this period shall be excluded from any calculation of time for purposes of the
application of the statute of limitations.

18. In the event the Offices determine that the Company has breached this Agreement,
the Offices agree to provide the Company with written notice of such breach prior to instituting
any prosecution resulting from such breach. Within thirty days of receipt of such notice, the
Company shall have the opportunity to respond to the Offices in writing to explain the nature and

circumstances of such breach, as well as the actions the Company has taken to address and

16
remediate the situation, which explanation the Offices shall consider in determining whether to
pursue prosecution of the Company.

19. In the event that the Offices determine that the Company has breached this
Agreement: (a) all statements made by or on behalf of the Company to the Offices or to the Court,
including the Statement of Facts, and any testimony given by the Company before a grand jury, a
court, or any tribunal, or at any legislative hearings, whether prior or subsequent to this Agreement,
and any leads derived from such statements or testimony, shall be admissible in evidence in any
and all criminal proceedings brought by the Offices against the Company; and (b) the Company
shall not assert any claim under the United States Constitution, Rule 11(f) of the Federal Rules of
Criminal Procedure, Rule 410 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, or any other federal rule that any
such statements or testimony made by or on behalf of the Company prior or subsequent to this
Agreement, or any leads derived therefrom, should be suppressed or are otherwise
inadmissible. The decision whether conduct or statements of any current director, officer, or
employee, or any person acting on behalf of, or at the direction of, the Company, will be imputed
to the Company for the purpose of determining whether the Company has violated any provision
of this Agreement shall be in the sole discretion of the Offices.

20. The Company acknowledges that the Offices have made no representations,
assurances, or promises concerning what sentence may be imposed by the Court if the Company
breaches this Agreement and this matter proceeds to judgment. The Company further
acknowledges that any such sentence is solely within the discretion of the Court and that nothing

in this Agreement binds or restricts the Court in the exercise of such discretion.

17
21. On the date that the period of deferred prosecution specified in this Agreement
expires, the Company, by the Chief Executive Officer of the Company and the Chief Financial
Officer of the Company, will certify, in the form of executing the document attached as Attachment
E to this Agreement, to the Offices that the Company has met its disclosure obligations pursuant
to Paragraph 6 of this Agreement. Each certification will be deemed a material statement and
representation by the Company to the executive branch of the United States for purposes of 18
U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1001 and 1519, and it will be deemed to have been made in the judicial district in which
this Agreement is filed.

Sale, Merger, or Other Change in Corporate Form of Company

22. Except as may otherwise be agreed by the parties in connection with a particular
transaction, the Company agrees that in the event that, during the Term, it undertakes any change
in corporate form, including if it sells, merges, or transfers business operations that are material to
the Companyâs consolidated operations, or to the operations of any branches, representative
offices, subsidiaries or affiliates involved in the conduct described in the Statement of Facts, as
they exist as of the date of this Agreement, whether such sale is structured as a sale, asset sale,
merger, transfer, or other change in corporate form, it shall include in any contract for sale, merger,
transfer, or other change in corporate form a provision binding the purchaser, or any successor in
interest thereto, to the obligations described in this Agreement. The purchaser or successor in
interest must also agree in writing that the Officesâ ability to declare a breach under this Agreement
is applicable in full force to that entity. The Company agrees that the failure to include these
provisions in the transaction will make any such transaction null and void. The Company shall

provide notice to the Offices at least thirty days prior to undertaking any such sale, merger, transfer,

18
or other change in corporate form. The Offices shall notify the Company prior to such transaction
(or series of transactions) if they determine that the transaction(s) will have the effect of
circumventing or frustrating the enforcement purposes of this Agreement. At any time during the
Term the Company engages in a transaction(s) that has the effect of circumventing or frustrating
the enforcement purposes of this Agreement, the Offices may deem it a breach of this Agreement
pursuant to Paragraphs 17-20 of this Agreement. Nothing herein shall restrict the Company from
indemnifying (or otherwise holding harmless) the purchaser or successor in interest for penalties
or other costs arising from any conduct that may have occurred prior to the date of the transaction,
so long as such indemnification does not have the effect of circumventing or frustrating the
enforcement purposes of this Agreement, as determined by the Offices.

Public Statements by Company

23. The Company expressly agrees that it shall not, through present or future attorneys,
officers, directors, employees, agents or any other person authorized to speak for the Company,
make any public statement, in litigation or otherwise, contradicting the acceptance of responsibility
by the Company set forth above or the facts described in the Statement of Facts. Any such
contradictory statement shall, subject to cure rights of the Company described below, constitute a
breach of this Agreement, and the Company thereafter shall be subject to prosecution as set forth
in Paragraphs 17-20 of this Agreement. The decision whether any public statement by any such
person contradicting a fact contained in the Statement of Facts will be imputed to the Company
for the purpose of determining whether it has breached this Agreement shall be at the sole
discretion of the Offices. If the Offices determine that a public statement by any such person

contradicts in whole or in part a statement contained in the Statement of Facts, the Offices shall so

19
notify the Company, and the Company may avoid a breach of this Agreement by publicly
repudiating such statement(s) within five business days after notification. The Company shall be
permitted to raise defenses and to assert affirmative claims in other proceedings relating to the
matters set forth in the Statement of Facts provided that such defenses and claims do not contradict,
in whole or in part, a statement contained in the Statement of Facts. This Paragraph does not apply
to any statement made by any present or former officer, director, employee, or agent of the

The Criminal Scheme
Overview

23. In or about and between 2009 and 2014, Goldman, through certain of its
agents and employees, together with others, knowingly and willfully conspired and agreed with
others to corruptly provide payments and things of value to, or for the benefit of, foreign officials
and their relatives to induce those foreign officials to influence the decisions of IMDB, IPIC and
Aabar to obtain and retain business for Goldman, including positions as an advisor to IMDB on
the acquisitions of Malaysian energy assets, underwriter of the IMDB bonds, and underwriter of
certain other IMDB business, including the contemplated initial public offering (âIPOââ) of
1MDBâs Malaysian energy assets. Leissner, Ng and Employee | used Lowâs connections within
the Governments of Malaysia and Abu Dhabi to obtain and retain this and other business for
Goldman and, in turn, concealed Lowâs involvement in the deals from certain employees and
agents of Goldman. In total, Goldman conspired to provide approximately $1.6077 billion to, or
for the benefit of, foreign officials and their relatives, of which approximately $18.1 million was
paid from accounts controlled by Leissner.

24. The bribes resulted in Goldman being engaged on, among other projects,
three bond offerings that were related to 1MDBâs energy acquisitions and that raised a total of
approximately $6.5 billion for IMDB in 2012 and 2013. The bribes were also intended to help

Goldman secure a role on the anticipated IPO of those energy assets. These three bond offerings
and a related acquisition, along with a transaction involving Low and IPIC,! ultimately earned
Goldman in excess of $600 million in fees and revenue across its divisions, and increased
Goldmanâs stature in Southeast Asia. In the course of this scheme, payments and
communications made in furtherance of the scheme were made via wires that passed through the
Eastern District of New York.

25. Pursuant to Goldmanâs internal accounting controls, each IMDB bond
transaction required Goldman managementâs general and specific authorization. Moreover,
because Goldman initially purchased the full value of each bond from IMDB using Goldmanâs
assets, the transactions needed to be appropriately authorized and properly recorded. Among
other things, Goldmanâs internal accounting controls included the Firmwide Capital Committee
(âFWCCââ), which was authorized by Goldmanâs Chief Executive Officer to provide global
oversight and approval of bond transactions, including those transactions in which Goldman used
its own assets to purchase the financial instruments, like the IMDB bonds. Goldmanâs internal
accounting controls also included approval of the bonds by Goldmanâs Business Intelligence
Group (âBIGâ) and compliance, both of which were represented on the FWCC. While certain of
Goldmanâs employees and agents, including Leissner, Ng and Employee 1, circumvented these
and other controls, other Goldman employees and agents who were responsible for implementing
its internal accounting controls failed to do so in connection with the IMDB bond deals.
Specifically, although employees serving as part of Goldmanâs control functions knew that any
transaction involving Low posed a significant risk, and although they were on notice that he was
involved in the transactions, they did not take reasonable steps to ensure that Low was not

involved. Additionally, there were significant red flags raised during the due diligence process

 

' This transaction involved Leissner, Employee 1, Low and IPIC, and Lowâs monetary
contribution to this deal involved funds misappropriated from the bond offerings.

9
and afterward, including, but not limited to, Lowâs involvement in the deals, that were either
ignored or only nominally addressed so that the transactions would be approved and Goldman
could continue to do business with IMDB.

Goldmanâs Relationship with Low

26. In or about 2009, Leissner and Ng were introduced to Low, who was
known to be close to various high-ranking officials in Malaysia and Abu Dhabi, and through
Low began cultivating relationships with Malaysian Official 1 and others to secure business for
Goldman.

27. In or about January 2009, Leissner and Ng discussed with Low and others
a role for Goldman in the creation of and potential fundraising for Terengganu Investment
Authority (âTIAâ), IMDBâs predecessor entity.

28. Leissner and Ng also attempted to onboard Low as a Goldman client, or
otherwise work with Low, on numerous occasions in or about and between 2009 and 2013. For
example, in or about September 2009, Ng referred Low for a private wealth management account
(âPWMâ) through a Goldman European subsidiary. Ng described Low as âour partner in a lot of
transactions in [M]alaysia. Largely the mid-east and [M]alaysia rationship [sic]. As part of the
onboarding process, Goldmanâs control functions, including BIG, vetted Lowâs finances and
raised questions about his source of wealth. As control functions personnel worked to diligence
those questions about Low, the business side continued to pressure them to approve Low as a
client. In a March 13, 2010 email, a Goldman regional head of compliance wrote to a high-level
BIG executive and others, expressing frustration with the pressure to approve Low and
underscoring the red flags Low raised as a client:

This has been an exceptionally trying experience I have to admit, and I believe that
no matter what we do [Goldman PWM representative] is not willing to accept that

10
we are not in a position to onboard this prospect .. . I do not believe we will ever
be able to get comfortable with this matter. Iâd like to shut this down once and for
all... Itis seldom that one sees a vendor report, which has been backed up verbally
by them, that so clearly states that we should exercise extreme caution.

29. Ultimately, BIG personnel rejected Low as a Goldman client because of
his inability to satisfactorily answer questions raised by Goldmanâs control functions, as well as
negative news coverage about Lowâs lavish spending. Notwithstanding this rejection, there were
additional attempts to onboard Low and his companies as a Goldman client.

30. For example, in early 2011, Leissner tried to onboard two of Lowâs
companies as clients of Goldman but was unable to do so due to complianceâs continued
objections to Low.

31. Around the same time, Leissner made an additional attempt to bring Low
on as a PWM client through Goldmanâs Singapore office, without referencing the prior attempt.
Low was again denied due to, among other things, his questionable source of wealth. In a March
11, 2011 email chain discussing the attempt, a high-ranking employee in compliance and MD
noted, âTo be clear, we have pretty much zero appetite for a relationship with this individual,â
and a high-ranking employee in BIG and MD expressed, âthis is a name to be avoided.â

32. Even after the control functions had rejected Low as a client, Leissner, Ng
and others at Goldman continued their relationship with Low and used him to obtain and retain
business for Goldman from 1MDB and others. In or about and between 2012 and 2013,
Leissner, Ng, Employee | and other Goldman employees worked with Low to help IMDB raise

more than $6.5 billion via three separate bond offering transactions, referred to internally at

Goldman as âProject Magnolia,â âProject Maximusâ and âProject Catalyze,â respectively.

11
Project Magnolia

33. In or about February 2012, IMDB engaged Goldman as its financial
advisor for its anticipated purchase of a Malaysian energy company (âMalaysian Energy
Company Aâ). Low helped secure Goldmanâs role in that transaction.

34. On or about January 23, 2012, Low arranged a meeting between Leissner,
Ng and a high-ranking 1MDB official. In making the arrangements, Low emailed all three at
their personal email addresses, and stated âMaking an introduction to [Leissner] and [Ng]âs
private e-mail accounts [....] Please exclude me from the e-mail list going forward.â Thereafter,
Leissner and Ng worked with the high-ranking IMDB official on the potential purchase of
Malaysian Energy Company A.

35. 1MDB was also interested in raising funds to acquire Malaysian Energy
Company A, including through a bond transaction. In or about early 2012, Leissner, Ng, IMDB
Official 1, IMDB Official 3, Low and others met in Malaysia to discuss the necessity of a
guarantee from IPIC to make the bond transaction feasible for Goldman, which would purchase
all of the bonds initially, and then sell the bonds to other investors.

36. In or about February 2012, Leissner and Ng traveled to London to meet
with Low and others to discuss the proposed bond transaction. Leissner and Ng utilized
Goldman resources to fund their travel to London.

37. At that meeting, Low explained that government officials from Abu Dhabi
and Malaysia needed to be bribed to both obtain the guarantee from IPIC and get the necessary
approvals from Malaysia and IMDB. Low advised that a high-ranking official of IPIC (âIPIC

Official 1â) and Malaysian Official 1 needed to be paid the largest bribes out of all the

12
government officials to approve the transaction, and that other lower-level officials would need
to be bribed as well.

38. Subsequently, Leissner and Ng each separately informed Employee 1
about the information they had learned at the London meeting regarding the need to bribe foreign
officials.

39. Low also promised remuneration to various |1MDB officials to facilitate
the deals and to ensure Goldmanâs role in those deals. For example, on or about March 8, 2012,
IMDB Official 1 emailed himself a copy of an online chat he had with Low on or about March
8, 2012, in which they discussed, among other things, Malaysian Energy Company A. In that
chat, Low told IMDB Official 1 that he would give IMDB Official 1 a âbig presentâ when the
Malaysian Energy Company A transaction was completed and then directed IMDB Official 1 to
âdelete from email and destroy once done.â

AO. On or about March 5, 2012, Leissner, Ng, Employee 1, Low and others
traveled to Abu Dhabi to meet with IPIC and Aabar representatives regarding the potential debt
financing that would assist 1 MDB in raising funds for the acquisition of Malaysian Energy
Company A. During the same trip, Low arranged a meeting between Leissner and IPIC
Official 1, during which Leissner delivered a letter from Malaysian Official 1 addressed to IPIC
Official 1.

Al. On or about March 19, 2012, IMDB formally chose Goldman as the âsole
bookrunner and arrangerâ for the $1.75 billion debt financing transaction designed, in part, to
pay $822 million towards Malaysian Energy Company Aâs acquisition. IPIC was chosen to
serve as guarantor on the bond and Aabar was granted certain options by the 1MDB issuer for

assistance in securing the guarantee.

13
42. One of Goldmanâs goals in pursuing this transaction was to secure more
business for itself, including a role in the potential IPO of IMDBâs energy assets, as explicitly
stated in Goldmanâs FWCC memorandum circulated during the approval process for Project
Magnolia: âPost closing, we expect significant follow on business from IMDB and IMDB
Energy[,] including the IPO of IMDB Energy.â

43. As work progressed on Project Magnolia, between on or about March 25,
2012 and on or about March 29, 2012, Leissner and Ng traveled to Los Angeles, California and
New York, New York to discuss matters related to Project Magnolia with Low and others.
Leissner and Ng traveled using Goldman resources.

44. Meanwhile, although employees within Goldmanâs control functions
suspected that Low may be involved in the deal, the only step taken by the control functions to
investigate that suspicion was to ask members of the deal team whether Low was involved and to
accept their denials without reasonable confirmation.

45. For example, during a telephone call in or about March 2012, a high-
ranking employee in BIG and MD voiced suspicions that Low was involved in Project Magnolia.
Leissner denied that Low was involved. Similarly, on or about April 3, 2012, the day before a
FWCC meeting to discuss Project Magnolia, a high-ranking executive in BIG, who was also an
advisor to the FWCC (âEmployee 2â), emailed other members of BIG that âLeissner said Jho
Low not involved at all in deal as far as he [is] aware but that Low was present when Leissner
met [IPIC Official 1] in Abu Dhabi.â

46. On or about April 4, 2012, the FWCC meeting was held, which was
attended telephonically by Goldman executives in New York, New York. During this meeting,

Leissner was asked whether Low was involved in Project Magnolia and Leissner said that, other

14
than arranging a meeting between Leissner and IPIC Official 1, Low was not involved. Ng was
also present during this meeting and did not correct Leissnerâs false statement about Lowâs
involvement. Later that same day, after the FWCC meeting, Employee 2 emailed Leissner,
stating âI was told Jho Low attended the meeting you had with [IPIC Official 1]... that was
wrong.â Leissner responded that he âhand delivered a letter by the Prime Minister of Malaysia
to [IPIC Official 1] and the Crown Prince.â Employee 2 replied, âI guess Low will have had a
hand in fixing that you were able to carry the letter from the Malaysian PM . . . Important we
have no role on our side for Low and we should ask that any payments from any of [the]
participants to any intermediaries are declared and transparent.â Leissner agreed with Employee
2âs admonishment.

47. Goldmanâs control functions accepted the statements of the deal team
members about Lowâs involvement at face value, rather than taking additional steps that
Goldmanâs control functions took in other deals, such as reviewing the electronic
communications of members of the deal team to look for evidence of Lowâs involvement (e.g.,
searching for references to Low). For example, had Goldman conducted a review of Leissnerâs
electronic communications at this time, it would have discovered multiple messages linking Low
to, among others, the bond deal, IMDB officials, Malaysian Official 1 and Abu Dhabi Official 1,
as well as the use of personal email addresses by Leissner and Ng to discuss Goldman business.

48. During this time period, Low, Leissner and Ng continued to structure the
bribery scheme. Leissner and Ng ultimately understood that Low intended to use the funds
raised through Project Magnolia to pay bribes, and cause bribes to be paid, to foreign officials in
Malaysia and Abu Dhabi to influence those officials to obtain the necessary approvals and

assistance for Goldman to execute Project Magnolia.

15
49. On or about May 16, 2012, Goldmanâs committees approved Project
Magnolia, and on or about May 21, 2012, the $1.75 billion bond issuance closed. Goldman
purchased the entire bond issuance from 1MDB.

50. On or about May 22, 2012, Goldman caused approximately $907,500,000
in proceeds from Project Magnolia to be wired to a IMDB subsidiary (âIMDB Subsidiary 1ââ),
through a correspondent bank account in New York, New York. Goldman booked
approximately $192,500,000 in fees for this bond transaction and an additional approximately
$16,800,000 in fees for advising on the acquisition of Malaysian Energy Company A.

51. Low and others caused the following transfers of funds from the proceeds
of Project Magnolia:

a. On or about May 22, 2012, approximately $576,943,490 of the
Project Magnolia bond proceeds were transferred from the account of IMDB Subsidiary | to an
account at Foreign Financial Institution A (âShell Company Account 1ââ) in the name of a
company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands with a name similar to Aabar (âShell
Company 1â). However, Shell Company 1 was not, in fact, associated with Aabar but was rather
associated with Abu Dhabi Official 1, Abu Dhabi Official 2 and Low. Abu Dhabi Official 1 and
Abu Dhabi Official 2 were signatories on Shell Company Account 1, and Low exercised control
over Shell Company Account 1.

b. On or about May 25, 2012, approximately $295 million was
transferred via wire from Shell Company Account | to an account at a foreign bank in the name
of a shell company beneficially owned and controlled by Low and Individual | (âShell Company
Account 2â). On or about July 25, 2012, another approximately $133 million was transferred via

wire from Shell Company Account | to Shell Company Account 2.

16
C. On or about June 18, 2012, approximately $133 million was
transferred from Shell Company Account | to an account at Foreign Financial Institution A,
opened in the name of a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands and beneficially
owned and controlled by a close relative of Malaysian Official 1 (âShell Company Account 3â).
Between on or about August 8, 2012 and on or about August 22, 2012, another approximately
$16 million was transferred from Shell Company Account 2 through another shell company to
Shell Company Account 3.

d. Between on or about June 20, 2012 and on or about November 20,
2012, approximately $60 million was transferred over multiple wires from Shell Company
Account 3 to the account of U.S. Motion Picture Company 1, an account at U.S. Financial
Institution | in Los Angeles, California (âHolding Company | Accountâ). U.S. Motion Picture
Company | was a U.S. legal entity owned, in part, by a close relative of Malaysian Official 1,
and the funds transferred from Shell Company Account 3 to Holding Company | Account were
used to, among other things, finance movie productions.

e. Between on or about May 29, 2012 and on or about August 1,
2012, approximately $258.75 million was transferred via wire from Shell Company Account 2 to
an account at Foreign Financial Institution B in the name of Shell Company Account 4, which
was beneficially owned and controlled by Abu Dhabi Official 1.

f. Also between on or about May 29, 2012 and on or about July 13,
2012, approximately $35 million was transferred via wire from Shell Company Account 2 to an
account at Foreign Financial Institution C in the name of Shell Company Account 5, which was

beneficially owned and controlled by Abu Dhabi Official 2.

17
g. Between on or about June 15, 2012 and on or about July 9, 2012, a
total of approximately $1.6 million was transferred from Shell Company Account 2 through
another shell company account to an account at Foreign Financial Institution D that was
beneficially owned and controlled by IMDB Official 3.

h. Between on or about June 11, 2012 and on or about July 16, 2012,
approximately $51.96 million was transferred via wire through the United States from Shell
Company Account 2 to Holding Company 2 Account, which was beneficially owned and
controlled by Leissner and his close relative, and, in turn, approximately $24.4 million was
subsequently transferred from Holding Company 2 Account to an account at Foreign Financial
Institution E beneficially owned by Ngâs relative (âShell Company Account 6â).â

Project Maximus

52. Within weeks of closing Project Magnolia, in or about May 2012, IMDB
sought assistance from Goldman to purchase a second Malaysian energy company (âMalaysian
Energy Company Bââ) and to issue a bond to raise funds for the acquisition. In or about August
2012, IMDB agreed to purchase Malaysian Energy Company B for approximately $814 million
and planned to finance the purchase with another $1.75 billion bond guaranteed indirectly by
IPIC.

53. Once again, Goldmanâs control functions simply accepted at face value
the representations of the deal team members and failed to further investigate Lowâs suspected
involvement in this bond deal. For example, on or about June 20, 2012, a member of Goldmanâs

control functions asked members of the deal team, âIs Jho Low involve[d] in this transaction?

 

? Based on records, the name of the company that held Shell Company Account 6 subsequently
changed, but Shell Company Account 6 remained beneficially owned by Ngâs relative.

18
Please also keep us posted if there are any other politically exposed person involve[d] in this
transaction in a non-official capacity.â A deal team member responded âno.â

54. Additionally, on or about October 10, 2012, in response to committee
questions, Leissner told a firmwide committee that neither Low nor any intermediary was
involved in Project Maximus. Despite their continued concern, as evidenced by their repeated
questions, Goldmanâs control functions did not engage in electronic surveillance of Leissnerâs
correspondence or activities to determine whether Low was involved in the deal.

55. Goldmanâs continued control failures were further compounded when
Goldman ignored additional red flags raised by Project Maximus, including that IMDB was
seeking to raise additional funds within a few months of raising $1.75 billion via Project
Magnolia without having utilized the full amount from that deal, and was also seeking to raise
far more than was needed to acquire Malaysian Energy Company B. Goldmanâs control
functions also failed to verify how Project Magnoliaâs proceeds were used.

56. On or about October 19, 2012, Project Maximus closed. Goldman
purchased the entire bond issuance from IMDB. On or about October 19, 2012, Goldman
caused approximately $1.64 billion to be transferred via wire through correspondent accounts in
the United States to another 1MDB subsidiary (â1 MDB Subsidiary 2â). Goldman booked
approximately $110,000,000 in fees for Project Maximus.

57. Low and others caused the following transfers of funds from the proceeds
of Project Maximus:

a. On or about October 19, 2012, approximately $790,354,855 was

transferred from 1MDB Subsidiary 2 to Shell Company Account 1.

19
b. Between on or about October 24, 2012 and on or about December
17, 2012, approximately $664 million was transferred from Shell Company Account | to Shell
Company Account 2.

C. Between on or about October 23, 2012 and on or about November
14, 2012, approximately $106.2 million was transferred from Shell Company Account | to Shell
Company Account 3, which was beneficially owned and controlled by a close relative of
Malaysian Official 1.

d. Between on or about October 30, 2012 and on or about November
19, 2012, approximately $30 million was transferred from Shell Company Account 2 to an
account held by Malaysian Official 1.

e. Between on or about October 29, 2012 and on or about November
30, 2012, approximately $214 million was transferred from Shell Company Account 2 to Shell
Company Account 4, which was beneficially owned and controlled by Abu Dhabi Official 1.

f. Between on or about July 3, 2012 and on or about December 19,
2012, approximately $21 million was transferred from Shell Company Account 2 and another
shell entity to an account beneficially owned and controlled by an official in the government of
the United Arab Emirates (âUAE Official 1ââ).

g. Between on or about November 2, 2012 and on or about January
22, 2013, approximately $31.6 million was transferred from Shell Company Account 2 to Shell
Company Account 5 and another account beneficially owned and controlled by Abu Dhabi

Official 2 and his close relative.

20
h. On or about December 6, 2012, approximately $5 million was
transferred from Shell Company Account 2 to an account beneficially owned and controlled by
IMDB Official 3.

1. Between on or about December 6, 2012 and on or about January
21, 2013, approximately $20.5 million was transferred from Shell Company Account 2 to
Holding Company 2 Account.

58. Leissner then directed follow-on transfers from Holding Company 2
Account to government officials and others. For example, on or about December 4, 2012,
Leissner emailed his close relative from his personal account with bank account details and
amounts to be wired from Holding Company 2 Account to Malaysian Official 2, IMDB Official
4 and IMDB Official 5. On or about January 15, 2013, Leissner again emailed his close relative
from his personal account, correcting some banking information and adding a transfer to 1|MDB
Official 2.

a. On or about December 7, 2012, Leissner directed approximately
$1 million to be transferred from Holding Company 2 Account to an account beneficially owned
and controlled by Malaysian Official 2.

b. Between on or about December 7, 2012 and on or about December
20, 2012, Leissner directed approximately $700,000 to be transferred from Holding Company 2
Account to an account beneficially owned and controlled by 1MDB Official 5 and his close
relative.

C. On or about December 20, 2012, Leissner directed approximately
$1 million to be transferred from Holding Company 2 Account to an account beneficially owned

and controlled by 1MDB Official 1.

21
d. Also on or about January 17, 2013, Leissner directed
approximately $1 million to be transferred from Holding Company 2 Account to an account
beneficially owned and controlled by IMDB Official 4.

e. On or about January 17, 2013, Leissner directed approximately $1
million to be transferred from Holding Company 2 Account to an account beneficially owned
and controlled by 1MDB Official 2.

Project Catalyze

59. In or about November 2012, almost immediately after Project Maximus
closed, Leissner* and Low began working on another bond issuance. Ultimately, Goldman
underwrote a third bond issuance that raised an additional $3 billion for IMDB with Goldman
acting as arranger and underwriter. This bond issuance was purportedly intended to fund
1MDBâs portion of a joint venture with Aabar.

60. Goldmanâs control functions had continued suspicions that Low was
working on the third bond deal. Once again, however, the control functions relied solely on the
deal team membersâ denials of Lowâs involvement without any further scrutiny.

61. On or about April 24, 2013, a senior Goldman executive who was a
member of Goldmanâs approval committee located in New York, New York, emailed Leissner
about âIMDB,â asking: âIs there a story circulating about an intermediary on the Magnolia
trades??â Leissner responded, âNot that I am aware of .. . There definitely was no intermediary
on any of the trades. The blogs in Malaysia always try to link a young Chinese business man

[sic], Jho Low, to IMDB. That is not the case other than he was an advisor alongside other

 

3 Ng had a new position within Goldman by this time and did not work directly on the deal team
for Project Catalyze, but was recognized by Goldman as a continued contact point for IMDB.

22
prominent figures to the King of Malaysia at the time of the creation of IMDB.â There was no
follow-up by Goldmanâs control functions about Low.

62. Goldman also failed to address the other red flags that were raised by the
proposed $3 billion transaction, including, once again, IMDB raising large sums of money with
no identified use of proceeds within months of Project Magnolia and Project Maximus, and
Goldmanâs failure to verify use of past bond proceeds. Adding to the transactionâs risks was the
upcoming Malaysian general election, which directly affected the political future of Malaysian
Official 1.

63. Goldmanâs committees nevertheless approved Project Catalyze on or
about March 13, 2013, and the proceeds from Project Catalyze were issued on or about March
19, 2013. Goldman purchased the entire bond issuance from IMDB and booked approximately
$279,000,000 in fees on Project Catalyze.

64. Low and Leissner continued to pay bribes to government officials from
the bond proceeds. On or about March 19, 2013, Goldman transferred via wire from and through
the United States approximately $2.7 billion from Project Catalyze to an account for another
IMDB subsidiary (âIMDB Subsidiary 3â) at Foreign Financial Institution A. Subsequently,
Low caused approximately $1,440,188,045 to be transferred through a series of pass-through
accounts to accounts beneficially owned or controlled by Low and Individual 1. Low then
directed multiple transfers to various government officials, including:

a. On or about March 21, 2013, approximately $620 million was
transferred from a shell entity beneficially owned or controlled by Low, Shell Company Account

7, to an account beneficially owned and controlled by Malaysian Official 1. Four days later, on

23
or about March 25, 2013, another approximately $61 million was transferred from Shell
Company Account 7 to the same account for Malaysian Official 1.

b. On or about April 5, 2013, approximately $10 million was
transferred from Shell Company Account 8, an account beneficially owned and controlled by
Low, to an account beneficially owned and controlled by Abu Dhabi Official 2.

C. On or about July 1, 2013, approximately $1 million was transferred
from Shell Company Account 8 to an account beneficially owned and controlled by IMDB
Official 5.

d. On or about October 21, 2013, approximately $11.5 million was
transferred from Shell Company Account 8 to Shell Company Account 3.

e. On or about September 11, 2013, approximately $1 million was
transferred from Shell Company Account 8 to an account beneficially owned and controlled by
IMDB Official 1.

f. On or about September 11, 2013, approximately $1 million was
transferred from Shell Company Account 8 to an account beneficially owned and controlled by
Malaysian Official 2.

g. On or about September 11, 2013, approximately $980,000 was
transferred from Shell Company Account 8 to an account beneficially owned and controlled by
Malaysian Official 3.

h. On or about September 11, 2013, approximately $895,000 was
transferred from Shell Company Account 8 to an account beneficially owned and controlled by

Malaysian Official 4.

24
1. On or about July 3, 2013, approximately $65.1 million was
transferred from Shell Company Account 8 to Holding Company 2 Account. From there,
Leissner directed payment of approximately $4.2 million to Shell Company Account 6, which
was beneficially owned by Ngâs close relative.

j. On or about July 29, 2013, approximately $1 million was
transferred from Holding Company 2 Account to an account beneficially owned and controlled
by IMDB Official 2.

k. Also on or about July 29, 2013, approximately $1 million was
transferred from Holding Company 2 Account to an account beneficially owned and controlled
by IMDB Official 4.

L. On or about July 19, 2013, approximately $6 million was
transferred from Holding Company 2 Account to another account beneficially owned and
controlled by Leissner and his close relative, Management Company | Account. Subsequently,
on or about July 22, 2013, approximately $6 million was transferred from Management
Company | Account to an account beneficially owned and controlled by IMDB Official 3.

m. On or about June 27, 2013, Low transferred approximately $30
million from an account he beneficially owned and controlled to an account beneficially owned
and controlled by UAE Official 1.

Other Anticipated IMDB Deals
65. After the bond deals were complete, Goldman continued to pursue IMDB
business, including a role in the anticipated IMDB Energy IPO. In the pursuit of that additional
business, in or about September 2013, Goldman hosted a roundtable in New York for Malaysian

Official 1. Several senior Goldman executives, Leissner, Low, IMDB Official 3 and others were

25
scheduled to attend this meeting, though Low did not ultimately attend. However, during that
trip, a New York jeweler (âJeweler 1â) met with Low and the wife of Malaysian Official 1 ina
hotel suite at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in New York, New York, to show the wife of
Malaysian Official 1 a piece of expensive jewelry that Jeweler 1 had designed for her at Lowâs
request.

66. On or about January 13, 2014, IMDB invited Goldman to submit a
proposal to provide services to IMDB in connection with the IPO. Goldman worked on the
proposed IPO through 2014, during which time Low and Leissner continued to make or promise
corrupt payments to government officials, including from Project Catalyzeâs misappropriated
proceeds.

67. On or about June 2, 2014, Leissner sent an email to himself at his personal
email account containing a chat between himself and Low in which the two discussed IMDB
business opportunities that Goldman was trying to win at the time, including the IPO.
Specifically, they discussed how to manage officials at IMDB to steer additional business to
Goldman, including getting Goldman to serve as a Joint Global Coordinator for the IPO.

a. For example, Low stated that IMDB Official 2 and another high-
ranking IMDB official were unhappy with Goldman for not âdeliver[ing]ââ a loan to IMDB in
2013, which was ultimately provided by Foreign Financial Institution F. As a result, according
to Low, IMDB would only give Goldman a more limited role in the IPO. Leissner responded
that he âwould have deliveredâ the loan, and expressed frustration that Goldman was concerned
about issues related to IMDBâs delayed financial reporting at the time, declaring âCommittee is

stupid!!!â

26
b. Low and Leissner then agreed that Leissner would âbabysitâ
IMDB Official 2 and the high-ranking IMDB official, and Low would âmanage via [IMDB
Board of Directors]. Leissner also noted that neither named official provided âmuch of valueâ
but that they âneed[ed] to suck up to them.â

C. Low and Leissner also discussed sending âcakesâ to âmadam bossââ
and Low asked if he could transfer money to Management Company 1 Account so that Leissner
could âsettle madam cakes 2.â Low asked Leissner, âDo u mind if funds go [from] [Shell
Company 1] to u [sic] direct at [Management Company 1]? Or u [sic] think too sensitive?â
Leissner responded, â[Shell Company 1] is ok too. But need to get it out asap. Best today.
Because I am seriously in trouble.â

d. Low and Leissner further discussed Leissnerâs continued efforts to
onboard Low as a formal Goldman client. Leissner explained he would âpush harderâ for Low
once Leissner was confirmed as Goldmanâs Southeast Asia Chairman of the Investment Banking
Division.

68. On or about June 2, 2014, approximately $1.215 million was transferred
from Shell Company Account 8 to Management Company | Account.

69. On or about October 10, 2014, Leissner caused approximately $4.1
million to be transferred from Management Company | Account to Jeweler | in New York, New
York, in part to pay for approximately $1.3 million in jewelry that had been purchased on or
about January 3, 2014 by the wife of Malaysian Official | while she, Malaysian Official 1 and

Low were in the United States.

27
70. On or about October 14, 2014, Leissner transferred approximately
$600,000 from Holding Company 2 Account to an account beneficially owned and controlled by
Abu Dhabi Official 2 and his close relative.

71. Also on or about October 14, 2014, Leissner transferred approximately
$3.5 million from Holding Company 2 Account to the business account of an associate of
Malaysian Official 1âs relative.

Additional Failures of Goldmanâs Control Functions

72. After the bond deals were completed, in or about and between March 2013
and February 2016, additional red flags were raised in the press and on internal phone calls
among Goldmanâs employees and executives about Lowâs involvement in the deals and the
possible payment of bribes in connection with the deals. Goldman failed to investigate these red
flags or to perform an internal review of its role in the bond deals despite the clear implication
that the deals had involved criminal wrongdoing. Further, high ranking employees of Goldman
failed to escalate concerns about bribery and other criminal conduct related to the bond deals
pursuant to Goldmanâs escalation policy, which required that any Goldman employee who
became aware of any conduct that could raise, among others, ââa legal, compliance, reputational,
ethical, accounting, [or] internal accounting controlâ issue to report such conduct immediately to
a supervisor and Goldmanâs control functions.

73. Specifically, in or about May 2013, a Goldman PMD (âEmployee 3â) who
had been involved in the IMDB deals, discussed the deals in a series of phone calls with
Goldman senior executives that were recorded on Goldman phone lines. For example, on or
about May 8, 2013, Employee 3 called a senior Goldman executive about, among other things,

Project Catalyze. Employee 3 stated, âthe main reason for the delay for [IPIC] not having

28
funded their three billion into the JV with IMDB is [Abu Dhabi Official 1] is trying to get
something on the side in his pocket.â He continued later, âI think itâs quite disturbing to have
come across this piece of information... .â The senior Goldman executive replied, âWhatâs
disturbing about that? Itâs nothing new, is it?â In response, Employee 3 agreed that the situation
was nothing new. Employee 3 had at least one substantially similar phone conversation with at
least one other senior Goldman executive.

74. Subsequently, in May 2015 and again in October 2015, amid negative
media reporting linking Low with the IMDB bond deals and Malaysian Official 1, Goldman
executives and employees discussed Lowâs involvement in the [MDB deals. For example, ona
recorded call on or about October 13, 2015, Employee 3 told the senior Goldman executive that a
senior IPIC officer had informed his subordinate that âthere are a number of key people who are
involved in, letâs call it the situation. [Abu Dhabi Official 1] is one. Jho Low for sure. He
thinks Jho Low is the leader of the pack. And he has a very strong view that [Leissner] is
involved.â The control functions never took steps to address these red flags.

75. There were also subsequent emails and recorded phone calls between
Employee 3 and senior Goldman executives in the control functions about the disparity between
how due diligence and risk issues were handled on various deals. In particular, they discussed
the unusual latitude granted to certain employees, such as Leissner and Employee 1.

76. For example, in or about January 2016, on a recorded call between
Employee 2, who had been involved in BIGâs review of each of the relevant transactions, and
Employee 3, they discussed, among other things, Leissnerâs conduct, including Leissnerâs false
statements that Low was not involved in the IMDB deals. Employee 2 then noted that there

were several similarly âproblematicâ people from a compliance perspective at Goldman, and

29
Employee 3 agreed, immediately mentioning Employee | as an example of a âproblematicâ
person. Employee 3 also noted the âdouble standardâ between the minor repercussions meted
out to favored employees like Leissner and Employee | when they got caught trying to
circumvent the control functions, and the more serious repercussions to other, less favored
employees who engaged in similar behavior. Employee 2 agreed, stating, âYes, double standard,
and it looks stupid.ââ In the course of the call, Employee 2 also noted that Leissnerâs email
communications had been searched as part of an internal investigation into a separate incident
involving the use of an intermediary that occurred subsequent to the IMDB deals, which
Employee 2 stated âseems to me should have been done ages ago.ââ Employee 3 similarly
discussed on a recorded call in or about February 2016 with a high-ranking employee in
compliance and MD how repercussions for control functions violations varied radically between
deals.

Goldmanâs Other Low-Related Deals and Contacts

77. The IMDB bond deals and underlying acquisitions were not the only
Low-related transactions that Goldman engaged in during the relevant period. Despite the
negative view that Goldmanâs control functions took of Low, there were numerous potential and
completed deals with which Low was involved in some manner.

78. For example, Goldman served as an advisor on a deal in or about 2013
where a Low-related entity was one of the original clients. The deal was not submitted for due
diligence review until it was substantially finalized. At that point, BIG raised concerns about the
involvement of the Low-related entity and advised the deal team that the deal should not proceed
if Low was involved as a client, received a fee or had an active role in the deal. Through his

relationship with Abu Dhabi Official 1, Low arranged for another entity to become Goldmanâs

30
putative client. However, Low remained in the deal as a co-investor and an active participant.
Goldman deal team members knew this was merely a technical change in the deal structure, and
knew but did not inform BIG of Lowâs continued involvement in the deal. BIG employees were
later surprised to see press reports that the deal had been completed with Lowâs involvement in
late 2013. The deal resulted in a multi-million dollar fee for Goldman. Goldmanâs control
functions performed no additional review after the deal was completed.

79. In addition, senior executives at Goldman had continuing contact with
Low during the relevant period. These contacts included, but were not limited to, a meeting in or
about 2009 between a senior Goldman executive and PMD and Malaysian Official | that was
arranged by Low; a meeting in or about 2012 that was attended by a Goldman senior executive,
Abu Dhabi Official 2 and Low, among others; and a meeting on a yacht in Southern France in or
about 2013 attended by another senior Goldman executive and PMD, Leissner, Malaysian

Official 1 and Low, among others.

CORPORATE COMPLIANCE PROGRAM

In order to address any deficiencies in its internal controls, compliance code, policies, and
procedures regarding compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (ââFCPAâ), 15 U.S.C. Â§Â§
78dd-1, et seg., and other applicable anti-corruption laws, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (the
âCompany ââ) agrees to continue to conduct, in a manner consistent with all of its obligations under
this Agreement, appropriate reviews of its existing internal controls, policies, and procedures.

Where necessary and appropriate, the Company agrees to adopt new, or to modify or
maintain its existing compliance programs, including internal controls, compliance policies, and
procedures in order to ensure that it maintains: (a) an effective system of internal accounting
controls designed to ensure the making and keeping of fair and accurate books, records, and
accounts; and (b) a rigorous anti-corruption compliance program that incorporates relevant internal
accounting controls, as well as policies and procedures designed to effectively detect and deter
violations of the FCPA and other applicable anti-corruption laws. At a minimum, this should
include, but not be limited to, the following elements to the extent they are not already part of the
Companyâs existing internal controls, compliance code, policies, and procedures:

Commitment to Compliance

1. The Company will ensure that its directors and senior management provide strong,
explicit, and visible support and commitment to its corporate policy against violations of the anti-

Company will also ensure that middle management, in turn, reinforce those standards and

C-]
encourage employees to abide by them. The Company will create and foster a culture of ethics
and compliance with the law in its day-to-day operations at all levels of the company.
Policies and Procedures

2. The Company will develop and promulgate a clearly articulated and visible
corporate policy against violations of the FCPA and other applicable foreign law counterparts
(collectively, the âanti-corruption lawsâ), which policy shall be memorialized in a written
compliance code or codes.

3. The Company will develop and promulgate compliance policies and procedures
designed to reduce the prospect of violations of the anti-corruption laws and the Companyâs
compliance code, and the Company will take appropriate measures to encourage and support the
observance of ethics and compliance policies and procedures against violation of the anti-
corruption laws by personnel at all levels of the Company. These anti-corruption policies and
procedures shall apply to all directors, officers, and employees and, where necessary and
appropriate, outside parties acting on behalf of the Company in a foreign jurisdiction, including,
but not limited to, agents and intermediaries, consultants, representatives, distributors, teaming
partners, contractors and suppliers, consortia, and joint venture partners (collectively, âagents and

d. political contributions;

e. charitable donations and sponsorships;
f. facilitation payments; and
g. solicitation and extortion.

procedures, including a system of internal controls, reasonably designed to ensure the maintenance
of fair and accurate books, records, and accounts. This system shall be designed to provide
reasonable assurances that:

a. transactions are executed in accordance with managementâs general or
specific authorization;

b. transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles or any other criteria
applicable to such statements, and to maintain accountability for assets;

C. access to assets 1s permitted only in accordance with managementâs general
or specific authorization; and

d. the recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets
at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences.

Periodic Risk-Based Review

of a periodic risk assessment addressing the individual circumstances of the Company, in particular
the foreign bribery risks facing the Company, including, but not limited to, its geographical

organization, interactions with various types and levels of government officials, industrial sectors

C-3
of operation, potential clients and business partners, use of third parties, gifts, travel and
entertainment expenses, charitable and political donations, involvement in joint venture
arrangements, importance of licenses and permits in the Companyâs operations, degree of
governmental oversight and inspection, and volume and importance of goods and personnel
clearing through customs and immigration.

no less than annually and update them as appropriate to ensure their continued effectiveness, taking
into account relevant developments in the field and evolving international and industry standards.

Proper Oversight and Independence

of the Company for the implementation and oversight of the Companyâs anti-corruption
compliance code, policies, and procedures. Such corporate official(s) shall have the authority to
report directly to independent monitoring bodies, including internal audit, the Companyâs Board
of Directors, or any appropriate committee of the Board of Directors, and shall have an adequate
level of stature and autonomy from management as well as sufficient resources and authority to
maintain such autonomy.

Training and Guidance

8. The Company will implement mechanisms designed to ensure that its anti-
corruption compliance code, policies, and procedures are effectively communicated to all
directors, officers, employees, and, where necessary and appropriate, agents and business partners.
These mechanisms shall include: (a) periodic training for all directors and officers, all employees

in positions of leadership or trust, positions that require such training (e.g., internal audit, sales,

C-4
legal, compliance, finance), or positions that otherwise pose a corruption risk to the Company,
and, where necessary and appropriate, agents and business partners; and (b) corresponding
certifications by all such directors, officers, employees, agents, and business partners, certifying
compliance with the training requirements. The Company will conduct training in a manner
tailored to the audienceâs size, sophistication, or subject matter expertise and, where appropriate,
will discuss prior compliance incidents.

9, The Company will maintain, or where necessary establish, an effective system for
providing guidance and advice to directors, officers, employees, and, where necessary and
appropriate, agents and business partners, on complying with the Companyâs anti-corruption
compliance code, policies, and procedures, including when they need advice on an urgent basis or
in any foreign jurisdiction in which the Company operates.

Internal Reporting and Investigation

10. = The Company will maintain, or where necessary establish, an effective system for
internal and, where possible, confidential reporting by, and protection of, directors, officers,
employees, and, where appropriate, agents and business partners concerning violations of the anti-
corruption laws or the Companyâs anti-corruption compliance code, policies, and procedures.

process with sufficient resources for responding to, investigating, and documenting allegations of
violations of the anti-corruption laws or the Companyâs anti-corruption compliance code, policies,
and procedures. The Company will handle the investigations of such complaints in an effective
manner, including routing the complaints to proper personnel, conducting timely and thorough

investigations, and following up with appropriate discipline where necessary.

C-5
Enforcement and Discipline

12. The Company will implement mechanisms designed to effectively enforce its
compliance code, policies, and procedures, including appropriately incentivizing compliance and
disciplining violations.

13. The Company will institute appropriate disciplinary procedures to address, among
other things, violations of the anti-corruption laws and the Companyâs anti-corruption compliance
code, policies, and procedures by the Companyâs directors, officers, and employees. Such
procedures should be applied consistently, fairly and in a manner commensurate with the violation,
regardless of the position held by, or perceived importance of, the director, officer, or employee.
The Company shall implement procedures to ensure that where misconduct is discovered,
reasonable steps are taken to remedy the harm resulting from such misconduct, and to ensure that
appropriate steps are taken to prevent further similar misconduct, including assessing the internal
controls, compliance code, policies, and procedures and making modifications necessary to ensure
the overall anti-corruption compliance program is effective.

Third-Party Relationships

14. The Company will institute appropriate risk-based due diligence and compliance
requirements pertaining to the retention and oversight of all agents and business partners,
including:

a. properly documented due diligence pertaining to the hiring and appropriate

and regular oversight of agents and business partners;

C-6
b. informing agents and business partners of the Companyâs commitment to
abiding by anti-corruption laws, and of the Companyâs anti-corruption compliance code, policies,
and procedures; and

C. seeking a reciprocal commitment from agents and business partners. The
Company will understand and record the business rationale for using a third party in a transaction,
and will conduct adequate due diligence with respect to the risks posed by a third-party partner
such as a third-party partnerâs reputations and relationships, if any, with foreign officials. The
Company will ensure that contract terms with third parties specifically describe the services to be
performed, that the third party is actually performing the described work, and that its compensation
is commensurate with the work being provided in that industry and geographical region. The
Company will engage in ongoing monitoring of third-party relationships through updated due
diligence, training, audits, and/or annual compliance certifications by the third party.

15. Where necessary and appropriate, the Company will include standard provisions
in agreements, contracts, and renewals thereof with all agents and business partners that are
reasonably calculated to prevent violations of the anti-corruption laws, which may, depending
upon the circumstances, include: (a) anti-corruption representations and undertakings relating to
compliance with the anti-corruption laws; (b) rights to conduct audits of the books, records, and
accounts of the agent or business partner to ensure compliance with the foregoing; and (c) rights
to terminate an agent or business partner as a result of any breach of the anti-corruption laws, the
Companyâs compliance code, policies, or procedures, or the representations and undertakings

related to such matters.

C-7
Mergers and Acquisitions

16. The Company will develop and implement policies and procedures for mergers
and acquisitions requiring that the Company conduct appropriate risk-based due diligence on
potential new business entities, including appropriate FCPA and anti-corruption due diligence by
legal, accounting, and compliance personnel.

17. The Company will ensure that the Companyâs compliance code, policies, and
procedures regarding the anti-corruption laws apply as quickly as is practicable to newly acquired
businesses or entities merged with the Company and will promptly:

a. train the directors, officers, employees, agents, and business partners
consistent with Paragraph 8 above on the anti-corruption laws and the Companyâs compliance
code, policies, and procedures regarding anti-corruption laws; and

b. where warranted, conduct an FCPA-specific audit of all newly acquired or
merged businesses as quickly as practicable.

Monitoring, Testing, and Remediation

18. In order to ensure that its compliance program does not become stale, the
Company will conduct periodic reviews and testing of its anti-corruption compliance codes,
policies, and procedures designed to evaluate and improve their effectiveness in preventing and
detecting violations of anti-corruption laws and the Companyâs anti-corruption codes, policies,
and procedures, taking into account relevant developments in the field and evolving international
and industry standards. Company will ensure that compliance and control personnel have
sufficient direct or indirect access to relevant sources of data to allow for timely and effective

monitoring and/or testing of transactions. Based on such review and testing and its analysis of

C-8
any prior misconduct, the Company will conduct a thoughtful root cause analysis and timely and

appropriately remediate to address the root causes.

C-9
ATTACHMENT D
REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
The Company agrees that it will report to the Offices periodically, at no less than twelve-
month intervals during a three-year term, regarding remediation and implementation of the
compliance program and internal controls, policies, and procedures described in Attachment C.
During this three-year period, the Company shall: (1) conduct an initial review and submit an
initial report, and (2) conduct and prepare at least two follow-up reviews and reports, as described
below:
a. By no later than one year from the date this Agreement is executed, the
Company shall submit to the Offices a written report setting forth a complete description of its
remediation efforts to date, its proposals reasonably designed to improve the Companyâs internal
controls, policies, and procedures for ensuring compliance with the FCPA and other applicable
anti-corruption laws, and the proposed scope of the subsequent reviews. The report shall be
transmitted to Chief, FCPA Unit, Fraud Section, Criminal Division, U.S. Department of Justice,
1400 New York Avenue, NW, 11th Floor, Washington, D.C. 20005; Chief, Bank Integrity Unit,
Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, Criminal Division, U.S. Department of Justice,
1400 New York Avenue NW, Washington, D.C. 20005; and Chief, Business and Securities Fraud
Section, U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Eastern District of New York, 271-A Cadman Plaza East,
Brooklyn, New York, 11201. The Company may extend the time period for issuance of the report
with prior written approval of the Offices.
b. The Company shall undertake at least two follow-up reviews and reports,

incorporating the Officesâ views on the Companyâs prior reviews and reports, to further monitor

C. The first follow-up review and report shall be completed by no later than
one year after the initial report is submitted to the Offices. The second follow-up review and report
shall be completed and delivered to the Offices no later than thirty days before the end of the Term.

d. The reports will likely include proprietary, financial, confidential, and
competitive business information. Moreover, public disclosure of the reports could discourage
cooperation, impede pending or potential government investigations and thus undermine the
objectives of the reporting requirement. For these reasons, among others, the reports and the
contents thereof are intended to remain and shall remain non-public, except as otherwise agreed to
by the parties in writing, or except to the extent that the Offices determine in their sole discretion
that disclosure would be in furtherance of the Officesâ discharge of their duties and responsibilities
or is otherwise required by law.

e. The Company may extend the time period for submission of any of the

follow-up reports with prior written approval of the Offices.
