(“Respondent”) violated Sections 4g and 6(c) of the Commodity Exchange Act (the “Act’”) and
Commission Regulations (“Regulations”). Therefore, the Commission deems it appropriate and
in the public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted to
determine whether Respondent has engaged in the violations as set forth herein and to determine
whether any order should be issued imposing remedial sanctions.

IL.

In anticipation of the institution of this administrative proceeding, Respondent has
submitted an Offer of Settlement (“Offer”), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Without admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, Respondent consents to
the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 6(c) and 6(d) of the
Commodity Exchange Act, Making Findings and Imposing Remedial! sanctions (“Order”) and
acknowledges service of this Order.!

 

Respondent consents to the entry of this Order, and the use of these findings in this
proceeding and in any other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission
is a party provided, however, that Respondent does not consent to the use of the Offer, or the
findings or conclusions consented to in this Order, as the sole basis for any other proceeding
brought by the Commission, other than in a proceeding in bankruptcy or to enforce the terms of
this Order, Nor does Respondent consent to the use of the Offer or this Order, or the findings or
conclusions consented to in the Offer or this Order, by any other party in any other proceeding.

 
Ii.
The Commission finds the following:
A. | SUMMARY

During the Relevant Period Respondent failed to diligently supervise certain of its
officers’, employees’, and agents’ handling of accounts held at Respondent in the name of a
fraudulent foreign currency exchange (“forex”) pool, Revelation Forex Fund, LP (“RFF”), in
violations of Regulation 166.3, 17 C.F.R. § 166.3 (2014). Specifically, Respondent’s officers,
employees, and agents failed to follow Respondent’s compliance procedures by: (1) failing to
provide adequate oversight of RFF’s accounts; and (2) failing to notify appropriate authorities of
certain activities associated with those accounts. Ultimately, RFF suffered a multi-million dollar
loss as a result of the fraud perpetrated by the operators of RFF, Kevin G. White (“White”), RFF
GP, LLC, and KGW Capital Management, LLC (collectively, the “White Entities”).”

Further, during the Division of Enforcement’s (“Division”) investigation of RFF,
Respondent failed to respond fully to a Commission document request in violations of Section 4g
of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 6g 2012), and Regulations 1.31 and 1.35, 17 C.F.R. §§ 1.31 and 1.35
(2014). Respondent’s violations of Section 4g of the Act also violated a previous Commission
order in violations of Section 6(c) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 9 (2012).

| i&B. RESPONDENT

Forex Capital Markets, LLC is a registered futures commission merchant (“FCM”) and
Retail Foreign Exchange Dealer headquartered at 55 Water Street, 50th Floor, New York, NY.

C, FACTS

1. The Commission Brought a Fraud Action Against White and the White
Entities, and White Was Also Prosecuted Criminally

On July 9, 2013, the Commission filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the
Eastern District of Texas (“Complaint”) that charged White and the White Entities with
fraudulently soliciting approximately $7.4 million from over 20 participants in a forex pooled
investment vehicle and purported hedge fund, RFF, as well as misappropriating approximately
$1.7 million of pool participants’ funds in violations of Sections 4b(a)(2)(A) and (C) and 40(1)(A)
and (B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. §§ 6b(a)(2)(A) and (C) and 40(1)(A) and (B) (2012), CFTC v. RFF
GP, LLC et al., No. 4:13-cv-382-RAS-DDB (E.D., Tex.). Specifically, the Complaint alleged
that while acting as the controlling person of the White Entities, which operated the RFF pool,
White misrepresented RFF’s profitability through solicitations showing highly exaggerated
annual returns and growth rates for RFF, when in actuality, RFF was unprofitable. The
Complaint further alleged that White misrepresented his investment experience and

 

? The RFF accounts generated $143,922.50 to Respondent in commissions and fees during

the period in which Respondent serviced them — July 2011 through July 2013.

 
misappropriated funds for personal use.” Subsequently, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern
District of Texas charged White with mail fraud. United States v. White, No. 4:13-cr-00258-
RAS-DDB (E.D. Tex.). White pled guilty to the criminal charge and was subsequently
sentenced to eight years in prison."

2. Respondent Failed to Supervise Diligently The Handling of RFF’s
Accounts by Its Officers, Employees, and Agents

Respondent’s compliance procedures require that Respondent “know all of its customers”
and that its employees with the potential to do so identify, and promptly report to appropriate
authorities, suspicious activities. During the Relevant Period, Respondent’s Account Services
Team (“Account Services Team”), which handled the RFF account, and Respondent’s
Compliance Department (“Compliance”) failed to follow Respondent’s compliance procedures
by failing to identify certain suspicious activities by White and by failing to promptly report
these activities to appropriate authorities.

White posted false claims of RFF’s profitable performance on two websites that he
controlled, www.revelationforex.com and www.kgweapital.com (collectively, “websites”).
During the Relevant Period, Compliance reviewed these websites on at least three occasions yet
failed to identify or report White’s false claims of RFF’s profitable performance. Further, during
the Relevant Period, Compliance failed to identify or report that White’s operation of the
websites on behalf of the White Entities violated their exemption from registering as a
commodity pool operator, for which White previously filed a notice pursuant to Regulation
4,.13(a)(3), 17 C.F.R. § 4.13(a)(3) (2014). Compliance failed to flag during the Relevant Period
that while operating the RFF pool under this exemption, White was proscribed from advertising
in connection with the pool by Regulation 4.13(a)(3), 17 C.F.R. § 4.13(a)(3) (2014).

During the Relevant Period, Compliance also became aware of statements posted in an
online forex trading forum alleging that White made several fraudulent claims regarding RFF’s
profitability ata Las Vegas tradeshow event, the “MoneyShow.” However, Compliance failed to
investigate or report these statements to appropriate authorities,

Finally, during the Relevant Period, the Account Services Team and Compliance failed to
identify or report that the margin requirements and net notional value of RFF’s positions
regularly far exceeded those permissible under White’s claimed exemption for operating the RFF
pool under Regulation 4.13(a)(3),

 

; As the controlling person of the White Entities, White was responsible for the operation

of the RFF pool and was Respondent’s sole point of contact relative to RFF,

4 On March 30, 2015, the court in the Commission’s case against White and the White

Entities entered a Consent Order for permanent injunction against defendants. The Consent
Order ordered them to pay a $4,150,000 civil monetary penalty and $3,365,888 in restitution. It
also imposed permanent registration and trading bans.

 
3. Respondent’s failure to respond fully to a Commission document request

On April 10, 2013, the Division sent a request for documents to Respondent pursuant to
Section 4g of the Act (“Section 4g request’) seeking, among other documents, all emails
between Respondent and White. Respondent responded to the Section 4g request on April 12,
2013, and later supplemented its response. Certain emails between Respondent and White
inadvertently were omitted from those responses, On February 11, 2014, Respondent produced
all of the inadvertently omitted emails in response to a Division subpoena duces tecum.

4. Respondent’s failure to comply with a previous Commission order

On October 3, 2011, the Commission ordered Respondent to cease and desist from
violating Section 4g and Regulation 1.35 due to Respondent’s previous failure to promptly
produce documents in response to a Commission document request. See In re Forex Capital
Markets, LLC, [2012-2013 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) 4 32,658 (CFTC Oct. 3,
2011) “October 3, 2011 Order’), As discussed above, Respondent subsequently failed to
respond fully to a Commission document request.

IV. LEGAL DISCUSSION

A, Respondent Failed to Supervise Diligently Its Officers, Employees, and
Agents Responsible for Handling RFF’s Accounts

Regulation 166.3, 17 C.F.R. § 166.3 (2014), requires that every Commission registrant
(except associated persons who have no supervisory duties) diligently supervise the handling by
its officers, employees, and agents of all activities relating to its business as a registrant.
Regulation 166.3 imposes upon registrants an affirmative duty to diligently supervise their
employees and agents by establishing, implementing, and executing an adequate supervisory
structure and compliance programs. In order to prove a violations of Regulation 166.3, the
Commission must demonstrate that either: (1) the registrant’s supervisory system was generally
inadequate; or (2) the registrant failed to perform its supervisory duties diligently. See In re
Murlas Commodities, Inc., [1994-1996 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) { 26,485, at
43,161 (CFTC Sept. 1, 1995); In re Paragon Futures Assoc., [1990-1992 Transfer Binder]
Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) ¥ 25,266, at 38,850 (CFTC Apr. 1, 1992), Evidence of violations
that “should be detected by a diligent system of supervision, either because of the nature of the
violations or because the violations have occurred repeatedly” is probative of a failure to
supervise. Paragon Futures, Comm, Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) J 25,266, at 38,850.

As discussed above, Respondent’s lack of diligence in administering its supervisory
system during the Relevant Period caused Respondent’s violations of its compliance procedures,
By such acts, Respondent violated Regulation 166,3, 17 C.F.R. § 166.3 (2014).

B. Respondent Failed to Respond Fully to a Commission Document Request

Section 4g of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 6g (2012), requires FCMs, among other registrants, to
maintain books and records pertaining to certain “transactions and positions in such form and
manner and for such period as may be required by the Commission” and to “keep such books

 
and records open to inspection by any representative of the Commission.” The Regulations
further elaborate that FCMs, among other registrants, must promptly provide required books and
records to a Commission representative upon the representative’s request. Regulations 1.31 and
1.35, 17 C.F.R. §§ 1.31 and 1.35 (2014); see also Forex Capital Markets, LLC, Comm. Fut. L.
Rep. (CCH) { 32,658 (CFTC Oct. 3, 2011) (holding that Respondent violated Section 4g of the
Act and Regulation 1.35 by failing to produce promptly certain records sought in 4g requests).
A violations of these record-keeping regulations does not require scienter. See In re DiPlacido,
[2003-2004 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. 4 29,866, at 56,590 (CFTC Sept. 14, 2004);
see also Inre GNP Commodities Inc., [1990-1992 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH)
{ 25,360, at 39,214 (CFTC Aug. 11, 1992); In re Buckwalter, [1990-1992 Transfer Binder]
Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) 4 24,995, at 37,687 (CFTC Jan. 25, 1991),

The facts surrounding Respondent’s production of documents show that Respondent
violated Section 4g of the Act, 7 U.S.C, § 6g (2012), and Regulations 1.31 and 1.35, 17 C.F.R.
§§ 1.31 and 1.35 (2014), because it did not respond fully to the Division’s Section 4g request.
As discussed above, Respondent did not produce certain emails until February 11, 2014, after it
was subpoenaed by the Division. Accordingly, Respondent failed to comply fully with the
Division’s Section 4g request.

C. Respondent Violated the Commission’s October 3, 2011 Order by Failing to
Respond Fully to a Commission Document Request

Pursuant to Section 6(c)(4) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 9(c)(4) (2012):

If the Commission has reason to believe that any person... is
violating or has violated this subsection, or any other provision of
this Act (including any rule, regulation, or order of the
Commission promulgated in accordance with this subsection or
any other provision of this Act), the Commission may serve upon
the person a complaint,

The Commission has relied upon this section of the Act and its predecessor in instituting
administrative procedures for violating a Commission order, See In re Newedge USA, LLC,
[2012-2013 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. 33,206 (CFTC Jan. 9, 2012) (finding that an
FCM’s violations of a Commission order constituted a violations of Section 6(c)) (citing Jn re
Grossfeld, [1990-1992 Transfer Binder] Comm, Fut, L. Rep. (CCH) 4 25,726, at 40,367 (CFTC
May 20, 1993) (affirming an administrative law judge’s determination that a failure to comply
with a Commission order amounted to a violations of a Section 6(c)’s predecessor, Section 6(b));
Lawrence v. CFTC, 759 F.2d 767, 771 (9th Cir. 1985) (finding that a Respondent’s failure to pay
a civil monetary penalty assessed by the Commission in an administrative enforcement action
constituted a violations of a Commission order)); see also CFTC y, Gibraltar Monetary Corp.,
Inc., No. 04-80132-CIV, 2006 WL 1789018, at *23 (S.D. Fla. May 30, 2006) (finding that
Defendants’ violations of a Commission order in committing options fraud also violated Section
6(c)) (citing Lawrence 759 F.2d at 771).

The Commission’s October 3, 2011 Order directed Respondent to cease and desist from
violating Section 4g of the Act and Regulation 1.35. Respondent violated the October 3, 2011

 
Order by subsequently violating Section 4g of the Act and Regulation 1.35 by failing to respond
fully to a Commission document request. This failure constituted a violations of a Commission
order and Section 6(c) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 9 (2012).

Vv. FINDINGS OF violations

Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that, during the Relevant Period,
Respondent: (1) failed to adequately supervise its officers, employees, and agents in violations of

Commission document request in violations of Section 4g of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 6g (2012), and
Regulations 1.31 and 1.35, 17 C.F.R. §§ 1.31 and 1.35 (2014); and (3) violated the October 3,
2011 Order and thereby violated Section 6(c) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 9 (2012).
