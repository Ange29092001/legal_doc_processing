ORDER INSTITUTION PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTION 6(c) AND (d) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT,
MAKING FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL sanctions

I. INTRODUCTION

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (““Commission” or “CFTC’”) has reason to
believe that from on or about late 2011 through May 2017 (“Relevant Period”), RBC Capital
Markets, LLC (“RBCCM” or “Respondent’) violated Sections 4c(a) and 4g(a) of the
Commodity Exchange Act (“Act”), 7 U.S.C. §§ 6c(a), 6g(a) (2012), and Commission
Regulations (“Regulations”) 1.11(e), 1.31, 1.35, 1.38, 3.3(e) and 166.3, 17 C.F_LR. §§ 1.11(e),
1.31, 1.35, 1.38, 3.3(e), 166.3 (2018). Therefore, the Commission deems it appropriate and in
the public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted to
determine whether Respondent engaged in the violations set forth herein and to determine
whether any order should be issued imposing remedial sanctions.

In anticipation of the institution of administrative proceedings, Respondent has submitted
an Offer of Settlement (“Offer”), which the Commission has determined to accept. Without
admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, Respondent consents to the entry
of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Section 6(c) and (d) of the Commodity
Exchange Act, Making Findings and Imposing Remedial sanctions (“Order”) and acknowledges
service of this Order. |

 

' Respondent consents to the use of the findings of fact and conclusions of law in this Order in this
proceeding and in any other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a
party or claimant, and agrees that they shall be taken as true and correct and be given preclusive effect
therein, without further proof. Respondent does not consent, however, to the use of this Order, or the
findings or conclusions herein as the sole basis for any other proceeding brought by the Commission or to
which the Commission is a party or claimant other than: a proceeding in bankruptcy or receivership; or a
proceeding to enforce the terms of this Order. Respondent does not consent to the use of the Offer or this
Order, of the findings or conclusions in this Order, by any other party in any other proceeding.

Il. FINDINGS

The Commission finds the following:

A. Summary

During the Relevant Period, RBCCM, a registered futures commission merchant
(“FCM”), failed to supervise its FCM activities in violations of Regulation 166.3, 17 C.F.R.
§ 166.3 (2018). RBCCM’s supervision failures resulted in hundreds of trades that violated the
Act and Regulations, in addition to other violations.

Between December 2011 and October 2015, RBCCM engaged in at least 385
noncompetitive, fictitious, wash sale transactions known as Exchange For Physical (“EFP”)
transactions (“Wash EFPs”),’ in violations of Section 4c(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 6c(a) (2012),
and Regulation 1.38(a), 17 C.F.R. § 1.38(a) (2018). Notably, 217 of those Wash EFPs occurred
after entry of a Consent Order in December 2014, which resolved a CFTC enforcement action
against RBCCM’s parent, the Royal Bank of Canada (“RBC”), for wash and fictitious
transactions (“Consent Order”).?

In addition, as detailed below, RBCCM’s supervision failures resulted in additional
violations, including: (1) failures to prepare, present, and timely file quarterly Risk Exposure
Reports (“RER”) as required on five occasions between October 2014 and December 2016, in
violations of Regulation 1.11(e), 17 C.F.R. § 1.11(e) (2018); (2) failure to disclose RBCCM’s
violations of Regulation 1.11 as material issues of non-compliance and misstating the status and
effectiveness of RBCCM’s Risk Management Program (“RMP”) in its Chief Compliance Officer
(“CCO”) Reports as required by Regulation 3.3(e), 17 C.F.R. § 3.3(e) (2018); and (3) failing to
maintain and timely produce required records, in violations of Regulations 1.31 and 1.35,

17 CLFLR. §§ 1.31, 1.35 (2018).

B. Respondent

Respondent RBC Capital Markets is a Minnesota limited liability company and
wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of RBC.’ In its capacity as an FCM, RBCCM executes RBC’s
proprietary futures transactions on designated contract markets in the United States as part of
RBC’s capital markets business. RBCCM also executes its own trades. Traders from RBCCM
and other RBC entities trade interest rate futures and swaps from the same physical desk in New
York City, they directly or indirectly report to the same supervisor for North American interest
rates, and RBC’s annual report aggregates RBCCM's interest rates profits and losses with all of

 

* An EFP is a transaction where the buyer of a cash commodity transfers to the seller a corresponding
amount of long futures contracts, or receives from the seller a corresponding amount of short futures, at a
price difference mutually agreed upon. The opposite hedges in futures of both parties are thus closed out
simultaneously.

its other capital markets business. At all times relevant, RBCCM has been registered with the
Commission as a FCM.

C. Facts
1. RBCCM’s Supervision Failures and Lack of Internal Controls

RBC takes an enterprise-wide approach to managing its subsidiaries. All RBC affiliates,
including RBCCM, must follow company-wide policies and procedures. RBCCM relied on
RBC’s global compliance resources and enterprise-wide risk management structure to comply
with the Act’s and Regulations’ requirements. However, RBCCM did not implement several of
those policies and procedures, which, as relevant here, resulted in hundreds of RBCCM trades
that violated the Act and Regulations as well as other violations described below.

For example, RBCCM described its futures compliance manual as the “cornerstone” of
the company’s regulatory risk management framework. RBC maintained the manual on an
internal website, but until at least May 2017, RBCCM had no system to ensure that employees
retrieved, reviewed, and followed it. As a result, RBCCM futures traders and operations
employees with responsibility related to futures did not receive or review the manual.

In addition, RBCCM entered into EFPs with itself and other RBC affiliates, but until at
least March 2017, the manual did not set forth the requirements for EFPs to be properly executed
within one legal entity or where there is common beneficial ownership between the parties.
Moreover, RBCCM also failed to conduct any formal futures or EFP training for futures traders
and operations employees until at least May 2015. As of February 2017, certain RBCCM
operations employees with supervisory responsibilities still did not understand certain basic
restrictions relating to the Wash EFPs at issue here.

In addition, in its 2013 CCO report, RBCCM stated that RBC’s internal auditors had
found deficiencies with RBCCM’s monitoring of futures trading, and that “RBCCM made
significant enhancements [including that] the Firm upgraded its trade surveillance utilized to
detect Cross transactions, Wash transactions and potential front-running.” But the former
employee who was then in charge of futures compliance at RBCCM (“RBCCM Futures
Compliance Officer’), and who had responsibility to review futures transactions for trading
abnormalities or potential violations of the Act or Regulations, did not monitor for potential
futures wash trades or randomly sample EFPs as expected until at least March 2015.

Also in 2015, as part of its effort to comply with the Consent Order, RBC delegated to
RBCCM surveillance of certain futures transactions, including off-exchange transactions,
executed in the United States. RBCCM rolled out an electronic surveillance program designed
to generate alerts for potential wash transactions, among other things. RBCCM expected that
RBCCM Futures Compliance Officer would review, assess, and close out all alerts. But
RBCCM never directed RBCCM Futures Compliance Officer to carry out those tasks, nor
followed up or checked to ensure the tasks were completed. Instead, RBCCM Futures
Compliance Officer only cursorily reviewed select alerts and even closed an alert (noting:
“independent traders”) for an EFP executed by the same RBCCM trader because he failed to
make any inquiries.
RBCCM’s supervision failures stand out in light of the entry of a Consent Order in
December 2014, which resolved a CFTC enforcement action against RBC for wash and fictitious
transactions. The Consent Order, among other things, prohibited RBC from future violations of
the Act’s and Regulations’ proscriptions against wash trading. Even though RBCCM had actual
notice of the Consent Order and RBC delegated execution and surveillance of the bank’s futures
transactions on exchanges in the United States to RBCCM, RBCCM failed to adequately
implement a reasonable supervisory system overseeing its futures transactions.

2. RBCCM Engaged in Prohibited Non-Competitive, Fictitious Wash EFP
Sales

Around December 2011, RBCCM began entering Wash EFPs internally to move
positions between RBCCM accounts trading interest rates at current prices because they believed
the exchange allowed it, and it was less costly and administratively cumbersome than other
options to manage risk. However, the Wash EFPs did not comply with the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange’s (“CME”) requirements for independent control of opposing accounts to EFP
transactions. RBCCM knew or should have known that the Wash EFPs were improper.

RBCCM employees asked RBCCM Futures Compliance Officer about the propriety of the Wash
EFPs, but he failed to respond, follow up with the CME, or provide any formal training until at
least May 2015.

Between approximately December 2011 and October 13, 2015, RBCCM entered into and
reported at least 385 Wash EFPs involving accounts that were not independently controlled. Of
the 385 Wash EFPs, approximately 227 involved one RBCCM trader who controlled both
accounts.

3. RBCCM Failed to Prepare and Timely File Multiple Risk Exposure
Reports

Beginning in January 2014, RBCCM, as an FCM, was required by Regulation 1.11 to
establish and enforce a system of risk management policies and procedures (the RMP).
Regulation 1.11 also required RBCCM to prepare and file RERs on a quarterly basis for senior
management and/or the governing body that set forth all applicable risk exposures of the FCM.
RBCCM failed to do so in October 2014, January 2015 and April 2015.

RBCCM filed its first RER for the quarter ending July 2015 late, on October 1, 2015.
The Commission notified RBCCM of its failure in the middle of 2016. RBCCM then filed its
October 2016 RER 106 days late on March 28, 2017 after the Commission explicitly requested
it.

4. RBCCM Failed to Disclose Material Non-Compliance Issues

To comply with Regulation 3.3(e), CCOs of FCMs must prepare a report on an annual
basis covering the firm’s most recent fiscal year and provide that report to the firm’s board of
directors or senior managers. Until November 16, 2016, FCMs were required to electronically
submit CCO Reports to the Commission not more than 60 days after the end of an FCM’s fiscal
year. Regulation 3.3(f)(2). Regulation 3.3(e) provides that the annual report must “[d]escribe
any material noncompliance issues identified, and the corresponding action taken.”

4
The CME examined RBCCM during RBCCM’s fiscal year 2015 (ending October 31,
2015). The CME had concerns with RBCCM’s RMP and about RBCCM’s failure to file
quarterly RERs. RBCCM did not disclose these violations as material noncompliance issues in
its 2015 CCO Report filed in January 2016. Instead, RBCCM reported that it intended to update
its RMP because “[m]ore specificity required; improvements to periodic risk reports.” RBCCM
also inaccurately suggested that the “CME found no issues” with its RMP because the CME’s
audit letter (which disclaimed any opinion on compliance with the Act and Regulations) omitted
reference to RMP deficiencies.

RBCC®M also did not disclose its failure to timely file its October 2016 RER in the 2016
CCO Report as a material noncompliance issue. At all times relevant, RBCCM understood that
failure to timely file an RER constitutes a material noncompliance issue requiring disclosure.

5. RBCCM Failed to Maintain and Promptly Produce Required Records

RBCCM disclosed to the Commission the existence of the 385 Wash EFPs in late
January 2016, a few days before RBCCM formally disclosed the Wash EFPs in its 2015 CCO
report (filed January 29, 2016). Upon receiving the relevant information, the Division promptly
sought to determine, among other things, the scope of the issues, the cause of the Wash EFPs,
who was responsible, and whether a supervisory system existed that was reasonably designed to
detect and deter such unlawful trade practices. RBCCM and RBC, however, failed to timely and
fully respond to the Division’s requests for production of records required to be maintained by
registrants under the Act and Regulations and subsequent subpoenas issued by the Division.

Moreover, RBCCM and RBC did not promptly produce the required records
notwithstanding the fact that the prior Consent Order required cooperation of RBC in any
investigation by the Division related to the subject matter of this action or any current or future
Commission investigation related thereto. From the outset of the Division’s investigation,
RBCCM sought to persuade Division’s staff that it was not necessary to pursue any inquiry into
RBC’s involvement with the Wash EFPs, even from a supervisory perspective, despite the inter-
relationship between RBCCM and RBC. Prior to June 2017, outside counsel told the Division’s
staff that he was trying to keep the Bank out of it. The Division expended considerable resources
trying to obtain information and timely compliance with its subpoenas from RBC and RBCCM.

In June 2017, RBC retained new outside counsel, and RBC and RBCCM began to
cooperate and respond to the Division’s requests in a meaningful way. However, even those
efforts were hindered by RBCCM’s failure to maintain full, complete, and systematic records of
their futures transactions in violations of the Regulations, which precluded the Division from
readily identifying relevant traders, account controllers, and their employers.

Til. LEGAL DISCUSSION
A. RBCCM’s Supervision Failures Violated Regulation 166.3.

Regulation 166.3, 17 C.F.R. § 166.3 (2018), imposes on registrants an affirmative
duty to supervise their partners, employees and agents diligently by establishing,
implementing and executing adequate supervisory structures and compliance programs.

5
A violations of Regulation 166.3 occurs where: (1) the registrant’s supervisory system
was generally inadequate; or (2) the registrant failed to perform its supervisory duties
diligently. In re GNP Commodities, Inc., CFTC No. 89-1,1992 WL 201158, at *19
(Aug. 11, 1992), aff'd sub nom. Monieson v. CFTC, 996 F.2d 852 (7th Cir. 1993); In re
Paragon Futures Ass’n, CFTC No. 88-18, 1992 WL 74261, at *14 (Apr. 1, 1992)
(concluding that the “focus of any proceeding to determine whether Rule 166.3 has been
violated will be on whether [a] review [has] occurred and, if it did, whether it was
‘diligent’.’’”), A violations under Regulation 166.3 is an independent violations for which
no underlying violations is necessary. Jn re Collins, No. 94-13, 1997 WL 761927, at*10

(Dec. 10, 1997) (citing GNP Commodities, 1992 WL 201158, at n.11).

Regulation 166.3 further provides that a registrant has a “duty to develop
procedures for the ‘detection and deterrence of [CEA violations] by its agents.’” Samson
Refining Co. v. Drexel Burnham Lambert, Inc., CFTC No. 82-R448, 1990 WL 282783, at
*11 (Feb. 16, 1990) (quoting Lobb v. JT. McKerr & Co., CFTC No. 85R-185, 1989 WL
242384, at *11 (Dec. 14, 1989)). The lack of an adequate supervisory system can be
shown where the registrant failed to develop proper procedures for the detection of
wrongdoing. CFTC vy. Trinity Fin. Grp, Inc., No. 92-cv-6832, 1997 WL 820970, at *29
(S.D. Fla. Sept. 29, 1997) (controlling person failed to establish or maintain meaningful
procedures for detecting fraud by firm’s employees and knew of specific incidents of
misconduct, yet failed to take reasonable steps to correct the problems), aff'd in part,
vacated in part and remanded sub nom. CFTC v. Sidoti, 178 F.3d 1132, 1137 (11th Cir.
1999). Evidence of violations that “should be detected by a diligent system of
supervision, either because of the nature of the violations or because the violations have
occurred repeatedly” is probative of a failure to supervise. Paragon Futures Ass’n, 1992
WL 74261, at *14).

RBCCM management failed to diligently supervise the FCM. The supervision
failures were systemic, occurred over a long period of time, and directly resulted in
violations of other provisions of the Act and accompanying Regulations. Therefore,
RBCCM’s conduct violated Regulation 166.3.

B. RBCCM Engaged In Wash Sales, Fictitious Sales and Noncompetitive Trading In
violations of Section 4c(a) of the Act

Section 4c(a)(2)(A) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 6c(a)(2)(A) (2012), provides that it is unlawful
for any person to offer to enter into, enter into, or confirm the execution of a commodity futures
or swap transaction that is, of the character of, or is commonly known to the trade as, a “wash
sale,” “accommodation trade,” or “fictitious sale.” Regulation 1.38(a), 17 C.F.R. § 1.38(a)
(2018), also prohibits knowingly entering into illegal non-competitive transactions to buy and
sell futures contracts.

Wash sales negate the risk or price competition incident to the market. Wilson v. CFTC,
322 F.3d 555, 559-60 (8th Cir. 2003) (affirming CFTC order finding Section 4c(a) violations).
Wash trading produces a virtual financial nullity because the resulting net financial position is
near or equal to zero. Jd.
A wash sale occurs with: (1) the purchase and sale; (2) of the same delivery month of the
same futures contract; (3) at the same (or a similar) price; and (4) with an intent to negate risk or
price competition, or the participant’s knowledge that the transaction was designed to achieve a
wash result. Jd. Wash sales typically are accomplished in two ways: by a trader: (1) buying and
selling with himself or herself; or (2) buying and selling with another person pursuant to a pre-
arranged plan or understanding. Sundheimer v. CFTC, 688 F.2d 150, 152 (2d Cir. 1982).

EFPs that are equal and offsetting in quantity and price, where the same entity, or
beneficial owner or controller is on both sides of the transactions, constitute “wash sales” within
the meaning of Section 4c(a) of the Act. In re SG Americas Securities, RBCCM, CFTC No. 16-
33, 2016 WL 5682204, at *8 (Sep. 28, 2016) (consent order) (citing Jn re Noble Americas Corp.,
CFTC No. 10-12, 2010 WL 1803817 (May 3, 2010) (consent order)). That the same entity, or
beneficial owner or controller, was on both sides of an EFP suggests intent to avoid price
competition and market risk standing alone. See In re Three Eight Corp., CFTC No. 88-33, 1993
WL 212489, at *10 (June 16, 1993) (paired orders for matching executions for a single account
suggests intent to avoid a bona fide market position). Likewise, an EFP for the same contract,
quantity and same or similar price—i.e., a wash result—reflects an intent to avoid market risk and
price competition. /d. Failure to inquire into the legitimacy of the EFP in the face of such facts
can support an inference of knowing participation in wash sales. Jd. Knowing participation is
the requisite scienter for violations of Section 4c(a) of the Act and Regulation 1.38(a). In re
Bear Stearns, CFTC No. 80-31, 1991 WL 83520, at *14-16 (Jan, 25, 1991),

RBCCM knowingly executed and confirmed the execution of at least 385 EFPs where the
opposing account controllers were not independent and the EFPs achieved a wash result.
Accordingly, RBCCM violated Section 4c(a) of the Act.

C. RBCCM’s Wash EFPs Violated Regulation 1.38(a)

Regulation 1.38(a), 17 C.F.R. § 1.38(a) (2018), generally requires that all purchases and

_ sales of commodity futures be executed “openly and competitively.” This requirement, however,
“shall not apply to transactions which are executed noncompetitively in accordance with the
written rules of the contract market which have been submitted to and approved by the
Commission, specifically providing for the noncompetitive execution of such transactions.” Jd.

CME and CBOT Rule 538 permit “Exchanges for Related Position”—of which EFPs are a
sub-set—under certain conditions. EFPs are permissible if they are between two independently
controlled accounts and involve privately negotiated and simultaneous exchange of a futures
position for a corresponding and offsetting cash physical position. Exchange for Related
Positions, CME Rulebook Rule 538 (Oct. 4, 2016). CME allows EFPs between “Independently
controlled accounts of the same legal entity . . . [if] the account controllers operate in separate
business units... [or] For EFPR transactions between accounts with common beneficial
ownership, the parties to the trade must be able to demonstrate the independent control of the
accounts and that the transaction had economic substance for each party to the trade.” /d. at Rule
538.B; CME Group, MRAN RA1006-5 (June 11, 2010); CME Group, MRAN RA1311-5
(Apr. 14, 2014). Ifa noncompetitive trade does not qualify for an exchange rule exception, it
violates Regulation 1.38(a). Williams v. Lind-Waldock & Co., CFTC No. 95-R022, 1997 WL
35391403 (July 10, 1997); GNP Commodities, Inc., 1992 WL 201158, at *14.

7
RBCCM entered into 385 EFPs that were not in accordance with CME rules because the
RBCCM interest rate traders did not have independent control of the accounts, they operated in
the same business unit of the company, and the profits and losses of the EFPs rolled up to the
same account resulting in a wash for RBCCM. Therefore, RBCCM violated Regulation 1.38(a).

D. RBCCM Failed to File Risk Exposure Reports in violations of Regulation 1.11

Regulation 1.11, 17 C.F.R. § 1.11 (2018), went into effect January 2014. The Regulation
was promulgated to enhance customer protections, risk management programs, internal
monitoring and controls, capital and liquidity standards, customer disclosures, and auditing and
examination programs for FCMs. See Enhancing Protections Afforded Customers and Customer
Funds Held by Futures Commission Merchants and Derivatives Clearing Organizations, 78 Fed.
Reg. 68,506, 68,512 (Nov. 14, 2013).

Regulation 1.11(e)(2) requires the risk management unit of each FCM to provide to
senior management and its governing body quarterly written RERs setting forth all applicable
risk exposures of the FCM, any recommended or completed changes to the RMP, and the status
of the program, among other things. An FCM is required to submit copies of its quarterly RER
to the Commission within five business days of providing the reports to senior management.

RBCCM failed to prepare and file RERs reflecting all applicable risk exposures for each
of the three quarters between July 2014 and April 2015. RBCCM filed two other RERs up to
106 days late despite prior notice of its violations. Therefore, RBCCM violated Regulation
1.11(e)(2).

E. RBCCM Failed to Disclose Material Non-Compliance Issues to the Commission in
violations of Regulation 3.3

Regulation 3.3(e), 17 C.F.R. § 3.3(e) (2018), requires an FCM’s CCO to annually prepare
a written report covering the most recently completed fiscal year. Regulation 3.3(e)(2) and (5)
provides in part that the CCO Report must include: (i) a review of each applicable requirement
under the Act and Regulations, including identification of the policies and procedures reasonably
designed to ensure compliance and an assessment of the effectiveness of those procedures; and
(ii) describe any material noncompliance issues identified, and the corresponding action taken.

Until November 16, 2016, FCMs had to submit their CCO Reports to the CFTC not more
than 60 days after the end of the FCM’s fiscal year. Regulation 3.3(f), 17 C.F.R. § 3.3(f) (2016).
The filing period was extended to 90 days thereafter. Chief Compliance Officer Annual Report
Requirements for Futures Commission Merchants, Swap Dealers, and Major Swap Participants;
Amendments to Filing Dates, 81 Fed. Reg. 80,563, 80,566 (Nov. 16, 2016).

RBCCM was aware of its failure to timely prepare and file multiple RERs in violations of
Regulation 1.11 at least as of 2015. RBCCM failed to disclose its violations of Regulation 1.11
in its 2015 CCO Report, filed with the CFTC in January 2016. RBCCM also failed to disclose
its continued violations of Regulation 1.11 as a material noncompliance issue in its 2016 CCO
report (filed with the CFTC in January 2017). Therefore, RBCCM violated Regulation 3.3(e).
F. RBCCM Failed to Maintain Complete and Systematic Records in violations of
Regulations 1.31 and 1.35

As an FCM, RBCCM must comply with the recordkeeping obligations set forth in
Section 4g(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 6g(a) (2012), and Regulations 1.31(a) and 1.35(a), 17 C.F.R.
§§ 1.31(a), 1.35(a) (2018). Failure to retain and promptly produce records required to be kept for
inspection to Commission staff violates the Act and Regulations. See GNP Commodities, Inc.,
1992 WL 12917230, at *15 (FCM violated Section 4g of the Act and Regulations 1.31 and 1.35
by failing to retain office orders and carbons that were the subject of a Division investigation).
Registrants are strictly liable for recordkeeping violations without showing scienter. See Ping
He (Hai Nam) Co. Ltd. v. NonFerrous Metals (U.S.A.) Inc., 22 F.Supp.2d 94, 104 (S.D.N.Y.
1998), vacated in part on other grounds, 187 F.R.D. 121 (S.D.N.Y. 1999). As explained by the
Commission in another matter:

The requirements of Regulations 1.31 and 1.35 are straightforward. Regulation
1.35(a) required [the registrant] to keep complete and systematic records,
‘together with all pertinent data and memoranda, of all transactions relating to its
business of dealing in commodity futures, commodity options... .’ Further, the
rule required [the registrant] to maintain copies of ‘al/ other records data and
memoranda... prepared in the course of its business... .’ Jd. (emphasis
added).... The trade sequence reports clearly relate to [the registrant’s] business
of dealing in commodity futures and were kept in the course of [the registrant’s]
business. Failure to maintain them thus violates Regulations 1.31 and 1.35(a).

Inre JCC, Inc., CFTC No. 89-4, 1994 WL 183817, at *13 (May 12, 1994), aff'd sub nom. JCC,
Inc. v. CFTC, 63 F.3d 1557 (11th Cir. 1995).

RBCCM failed to maintain, preserve, and promptly produce for inspection complete and
systematic records of its wash EFP transactions. RBCCM thus violated Section 4g(a) of the Act
and Regulations 1.31(a) and 1.35(a).

G. RBCCM is Liable for Its Employees’ Acts and Omissions

Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 2(a)(1)(B) (2012), and Regulation 1.2,
17 C.F.R. § 1.2 (2018), provide that the act, omission, or failure of any official, agent, or other
person acting for any individual, association, partnership, corporation, or trust within the scope
of his employment or office shall be deemed the act, omission, or failure of such individual,
association, partnership, corporation or trust. Pursuant to Section 2(a)(1)(B) and Regulation 1.2,
strict liability is imposed on principals for the actions of their agents. See, e.g., Rosenthal & Co.
v. CFTC, 802 F.2d 963, 966 (7th Cir. 1986); Dohmen-Ramirez & Wellington Advisory, Inc. v.
CFTC, 837 F.2d 847, 857-58 (9th Cir. 1998); but see CFTC v. Gibraltar Monetary Corp., 575
F.3d 1180, 1188-89 (11th Cir. 2009) (Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act and Regulation 1.2 codify
common law principal agent liability).
