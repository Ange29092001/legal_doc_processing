ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTIONS 6(c) AND 6(d) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, AS AMENDED,
MAKING FINDINGS AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

I.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“Commission”) has reason to believe that
Olam International, Ltd. (“Olam International”) and Olam Americas, Inc. (“Olam Americas”)
(collectively, “Respondents”) violated Section 4a(e) of the Commodity Exchange Act (“Act”),
7 ULS.C, § 6a(e) (2012), on seven trading days between February 2011 and August 2014; Section
Ac(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 6c(a) (2012), and Commission Regulation (“Regulation”) 1.38(a),
17 C.F.R. § 1.38(a) (2014), on sixty-four occasions between February 2011 and January 2013;
and Section 41 of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 61 (2012), and Regulation 18.04, 17 C.FLR. § 18.04 (2014).
Therefore, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest that public
administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted to determine whether Respondents
engaged in the violations set forth herein and to determine whether any order should be issued
imposing remedial sanctions.

I.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Respondents have
submitted an Offer of Settlement (“Offer”), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Without admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, Respondents consent to
the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 6(c) and 6(d) of the
Commodity Exchange Act, as Amended, Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions
(“Order”) and acknowledge service of this Order.

 

' Respondents consent to the entry of this Order and to the use of these findings in this proceeding and in
any other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party; provided,
however, that Respondents do not consent to the use of the Offer, or the findings or conclusions in this
Order consented to in the Offer, as the sole basis for any other proceeding brought by the Commission,
other than in a proceeding in bankruptcy or to enforce the terms of this Order. Nor do Respondents

The Commission finds the following:
A. Summary

On seven trading days between February 2011 and August 2014, Olam International and
Olam Americas held aggregated net positions in cocoa futures contracts that exceeded position
limits established by ICE Futures U.S. Inc. “IFUS”). On sixty-four occasions between February
2011 and January 2013, Olam International and Olam Americas executed exchange of futures for
physical transactions (“EFPs”) opposite each other’s cocoa futures trading accounts, even though
their accounts were not independently controlled as required for such transactions. Additionally,
Olam International submitted to the Commission a Form 40 “Statement of Reporting Trader” in
each of 2010 and 2012, and Olam Americas submitted to the Commission a Form 40 in 2012,
that failed to identify all required information, including that their cocoa futures trading accounts
were not independently controlled.

B. Respondents

Olam International, Ltd. is a global supply chain manager of agricultural commodities
with its headquarters in Singapore. Among other activities, it purchases cocoa from farmers,
merchants, and marketing associations, processes cocoa, and sells it to chocolate manufacturers.
Olam International has never been registered with the Commission in any capacity.

Olam Americas, Inc. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Olam International and is based in
New Jersey. Among other activities, it purchases cocoa from Olam International and unrelated
parties and sells cocoa to end users in the United States. Olam Americas has never been
registered with the Commission in any capacity.

C, Facts

The trading of cocoa futures is subject to position limits established by IFUS. IFUS Rule
6.17(b), which was in effect at all times relevant to this Order, states that the maximum net long
or short position that a market participant may own or control in the cocoa futures contract traded
on IFUS is 1,000 contracts during the spot month, a limitation that becomes effective at the close
of business on the trading day prior to first notice day.”

At all times relevant to this Order, Olam International operated a futures trading desk in
London, England, and Olam Americas operated a futures trading desk in Summit, New Jersey.
Between February 2011 and January 2013, cocoa futures traders on both desks had access to
each other’s position information and regularly discussed the cocoa markets, and Olam
Americas’ cocoa futures traders placed orders to buy and sell cocoa futures contracts on behalf

consent to the use of the Offer or this Order, or the findings or conclusions in this Order consented to in
the Offer, by any other party in any other proceeding.

* First notice day is the first day on which notices of intent to deliver actual commodities against futures
market positions can be received,

 
of Olam International’s cocoa operations in Ecuador. Additionally, between January 2012 and
May 2012, an Olam Americas cocoa futures trader supervised certain of Olam International’s
cocoa futures trading activities. As a result, between February 2011 and January 2013, Olam
International’s and Olam Americas’ cocoa futures positions should have been aggregated for
position limit purposes.

When aggregated, the cocoa futures positions of Olam International and Olam Americas
exceeded the 1,000-contract spot month position limit for cocoa futures contracts traded on IFUS
as follows: in the March 2011 contract, by 508 contracts on February 11, 2011; in the March
2012 contract, by 923 contracts on February 14, 2012, 516 contracts on February 15, 2012, and
90 contracts on February 16, 2012; and in the May 2012 contract, by 187 contracts on April 16,
2012 and 26 contracts on April 17, 2012.

The Act and Regulations permit noncompetitive trading, such as EFPs, only if such
transactions are conducted in accordance with rules of an exchange, such as IFUS, that are
approved by the Commission. At all times relevant to this Order, IFUS rules permitted the
transaction of EFPs between independently controlled accounts. However, Olam International’s
and Olam Americas’ cocoa futures trading accounts were not independently controlled between
February 2011 and January 2013, rendering the sixty-four EFPs they executed opposite each
other’s accounts during this time period impermissible.

Upon special call by the Commission, traders who hold reportable positions are required
to file with the Commission a “Statement of Reporting Trader” on Form 40. The Form 40 asks
the reporting trader to identify whether the trader controls the futures or options trading of any
other persons, including individuals, associations, partnerships, corporations, and trusts. It also
asks the reporting trader if any other persons control the trading of the reporting trader. Olam
International, in 2010 and 2012, and Olam Americas, in 2012, filed with the Commission a
“Statement of Reporting Trader” that answered both of these questions in the negative, failing to
disclose that their cocoa futures trading accounts were not independently controlled.

On February 25, 2013, Olam International and Olam Americas began aggregating their
cocoa futures positions and submitted a revised Form 40 to the Commission disclosing that they
were trading cocoa futures as a single global unit. Subsequently, on August 15, 2014, their
ageregated cocoa futures positions exceeded the 1,000-contract spot month position limit for
cocoa futures contracts traded on IFUS in the September 2014 contract by 24 contracts, Olam
Americas self-reported this violation to IFUS and reduced their position to within position limits
on the following trading day.

IV.
LEGAL DISCUSSION

Section 4a(e) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 6a(e) (2012), makes it unlawful “for any person to
violate any bylaw, rule, regulation, or resolution of any contract market, derivatives transaction
execution facility, or other board of trade licensed, designated, or registered by the Commission
... fixing limits on the amount of trading which may be done or positions which may be held by
any person under contracts of sale of any commodity for future delivery or under options on such

 
contracts or commodities, if such bylaw, rule, regulation, or resolution has been approved by the
Commission or certified by a registered entity pursuant to [S]ection S5c(c)(1)” of the Act,

7 U.S.C, § 7a-2(c) (2012). On September 1, 2005, the Board of Trade of the City of New York,
Inc. (“NYBOT”), a designated contract market pursuant to Section 5 of the Act that by later
merger became IFUS,” submitted writteri certification to the Commission pursuant to Section
Se(c)(1) of the Act for an amendment to its Rule 6.17 that established the spot month limit for
cocoa futures positions traded on the exchange as 1,000 contracts.

Regulation 150.5(g), 17 C.F.R. § 150.5(g) (2014), provides that “[i]n determining
whether any person has exceeded the limits established [by a designated contract market], all
positions in accounts for which such person by power of attorney or otherwise directly or
indirectly controls trading shall be included with the positions held by such person; such limits
upon positions shall apply to positions held by two or more person[s] acting pursuant to an
express or implied agreement or understanding, the same as if the positions were held by a single
person.” Similarly, IFUS Rule 6.12 provides that IFUS’s position limits “shall apply to all
positions held by any Person, including those positions in accounts for which such Person by
power of attorney or otherwise directly or indirectly controls trading; and in the case of positions
held by two (2) or more Persons acting pursuant to an express or implied agreement or
understanding, the same as if all of the positions were held by a single Person.”

The Commission does not need to establish scienter —i.e., proof of intent to exceed the
applicable position limit — in order to prove a violation of Section 4a(e) of the Act. See Saberi v.
CFTC, 488 F.3d 1207, 1212 (9th Cir. 2007); CFTC vy, Hunt, 591 F.2d 1211, 1218 (7th Cir,
1979). Instead, the plain language of Section 4a(e) of the Act “unambiguously imposes liability
for violations of contract market position limit rules” such as IFUS Rule 6.17. Saberi, 488 F.3d
at 1212.

Because Olam International and Olam Americas directly or indirectly controlled the
other’s cocoa futures trading activities and/or acted pursuant to an express or implied agreement
or understanding, their cocoa futures positions should have been aggregated for position limit
purposes beginning in February 2011. By exceeding, on an aggregated basis, the IFUS spot
month limit of 1,000 cocoa futures contracts on seven trading days between February 2011 and
August 2014, Respondents violated Section 4a(e) of the Act.

Section 4c(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 6c(a) (2012), makes it unlawful to engage in any
transaction that is of the character of, or commonly known to the trade, as a “wash sale” or that is
a fictitious sale, Regulation 1.38(a), 17 C.F.R. § 1.38(a) (2014), requires futures contracts to be
executed openly and competitively and permits noncompetitive trading only if executed “in
accordance with written rules of the contract market which have been submitted to and approved
by the Commission, specifically providing for the noncompetitive execution of such
transactions.” At no time relevant to this Order did IFUS rules approved by the Commission

 

* On January 12, 2007, IntercontinentalExchange, Inc. (“ICE”) announced that its merger with NYBOT
was complete. Effective September 3, 2007, NYBOT changed its corporate name to IFUS.

 
permit EFPs, noncompetitive trades, between accounts under common control.” By executing
sixty-four EFPs opposite each other’s cocoa futures trading accounts, which were not
independently controlled as required for such transactions, between February 2011 and January
2013, Respondents violated Section 4c(a) of the Act and Regulation 1.38(a).

Section 4i of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 61 (2012), and Regulation 18.04, 17 C.F.R. § 18.04
(2014), together require every trader who owns, holds, or controls a reportable futures or options
position to file with the Commission a “Statement of Reporting Trader” on Form 40 in response
to the Commission’s special call, to be completed in accordance with the form’s
instructions, The Form 40 specifically requires a reportable trader to state whether it controls the
futures trading of anyone else and whether anyone else controls the trading of the reportable
trader. By failing to disclose that their cocoa futures trading accounts were not independently
controlled on Olam International’s 2010 and 2012 Form 40s and on Olam Americas’ 2012 Form
40, Respondents violated Section 4i of the Act and Regulation 18.04.

18.04, 17 C.F.R. §§ 1.38(a) and 18.04 (2014),
