ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTION 6(C) AND (D) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, MAKING
FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

I. INTRODUCTION

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“Commission”) has reason to believe that
from in or about March 2015 to at least January 2018 (“Relevant Period”), Merrill Lynch, Pierce,
Fenner & Smith Incorporated (“Respondent”) violated Section 4g of the Commodity Exchange
Act (“Act”), 7 U.S.C. § 4g (2012), and regulations 1.31, 1.35, and 166.3, 17 C.F.R. §§ 1.31,
1.35, and 166.3 (2018) of the Commission Regulations (“Regulations”) promulgated thereunder.
Therefore, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest that public
administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted to determine whether Respondent
engaged in the violations set forth herein and to determine whether any order should be issued
imposing remedial sanctions.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Respondent has
submitted an Offer of Settlement (“Offer”), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Without admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, Respondent consents to
the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Section 6(c) and (d) of the Commodity
Exchange Act, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (“Order”) and acknowledges
service of this Order.

 

' Respondent consents to the use of the findings of fact and conclusions of law in this Order in this proceeding and
in any other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party or claimant, and agrees
that they shall be taken as true and correct and be given preclusive effect therein, without further proof. Respondent
does not consent, however, to the use of this Order, or the findings or conclusions herein, as the sole basis for any
other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party or claimant, other than: a
proceeding in bankruptcy or receivership; or a proceeding to enforce the terms of this Order. Respondent does not
consent to the use of the Offer or this Order, or the findings or conclusions in this Order, by any other party in any
other proceeding.
Il. FINDINGS
The Commission finds the following:
A. SUMMARY

For nearly three years, Respondent, a registered futures commission merchant (“FCM”),
failed to promptly produce reliable audit trail data requested by the Division of Enforcement
(“Division”). These failures substantially delayed a Division investigation and were due in large
part to Respondent’s failure to develop and diligently administer adequate procedures for
responding to routine regulatory requests.

B. RESPONDENT

Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated is a subsidiary of BAC North
America Holding Company and is headquartered in New York, New York. Respondent is the
executing broker for a third-party firm that was the subject of a Division investigation.
Respondent is registered with the Commission as an FCM.

C. FACTS

The Division requested audit trail data, among other records, as part of an ongoing
investigation on three separate dates in 2015. Respondent maintained the audit trail data in its
capacity as an executing broker for a third-party firm. Respondent was required to maintain and
produce this audit trail data pursuant to Section 4g of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 6g (2012), and
Regulations 1.31 and 1.35, 17 C.F.R. §§ 1.31 and 1.35 (2018).

The productions made in response to the requests for audit trail data were both
significantly delayed and flawed. Namely, even after the Division agreed to limit the scope of
the requests, Respondent did not produce any audit trail data until January 2017—more than
eighteen months after the initial requests. Moreover, this production was incomplete and
required a supplemental production in February 2017. Thereafter, the Division identified
numerous issues with the audit trail data produced, which included unpopulated fields. After
numerous discussions and reproduction of data to correct the issues, the Division was led to
believe that the production of audit trail data was complete.

Then in December 2017—more than two-and-a-half years after the initial document
requests were made—Respondent identified a significant gap in the audit trail data that had been
produced. Respondent ultimately located and produced the missing audit trail data in January
2018. This substantially delayed the Division’s investigation.

The Division subsequently learned that Respondent failed to develop and diligently
administer adequate procedures to properly respond to the Division’s requests for required audit
trail data, and otherwise lacked an adequate supervisory system to ensure the required records
were properly kept and promptly produced. For example, Respondent did not have a process in
place to locate account numbers or order entry operator identification numbers; instead,
operations personnel simply worked from memory when searching for the data.
Il. LEGAL DISCUSSION
A. Failure to Promptly Produce Reliable Records

As an FCM, Respondent is required to comply with the obligations set forth in Section 4g
of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 6g (2012), and Regulations 1.31 and 1.35, 17 C.F.R. §§ 1.31 and 1.35
(2018). Section 4g of the Act requires FCMs, among other registrants, to “keep books and
records pertaining to transactions and positions of their customers and commodities for future
delivery, and shall make such records available for inspection by the Commission.” 7 U.S.C.

§ 6g(a).

Before August 28, 2017, Regulation 1.31 stated that persons required to maintain books
and records under the Act or Regulations shall produce such records “promptly” to a
Commission representative upon request. 17 C.F.R. § 1.31(a)(2) (2017); see also Inre IKON
Glob. Mkts., Inc., CFTC No. 17-23, 2017 WL 3868976, at *2 (Aug. 31, 2017) (consent order
finding violations of Regulation 1.31 when FCM failed to produce documents over a two-year
period); In re Barclays Bank PLC, CFTC No. 16-30, 2016 WL 5582339, at *2 (Sept. 22, 2016)
(consent order finding violations of Regulation 1.31 when FCM failed to produce trade
confirmation for fourteen months).

On August 28, 2017, Regulation 1.31 was amended to read: “a records entity must
produce such regulatory records in the form and medium requested promptly, upon request,
unless otherwise directed by the Commission representative.” 17 C.F.R. § 1.31(d)(3)i) (2018).
Revised Regulation 1.31 also states that if records are maintained electronically, registrants must
“establish appropriate systems and controls that ensure the authenticity and reliability of
electronic regulatory records” and “ensure the records entity is able to produce electronic
regulatory records in accordance with the Regulations.” 17 C.F.R. § 1.31(c)(@) (2018).

Regulations 1.35 further elaborates that FCMs, among other registrants, must:

[k]eep full, complete, and systematic records .. . of all transactions
relating to its business of dealing commodity interests... which
shall include all orders (filled, unfilled, or canceled), trading

cards, ... journals, ledgers, ... copies of confirmations ... and
all other records, which have been prepared in the course of its
business of dealing in commodity interests ....

17 C.F.R. § 1.35(a)(1)() (2018). These records include audit trail data. See Inre ABN AMRO
Clearing Chicago LLC, CFTC No. 18-31, 2018 WL 4502261, at *4 (Sept. 14, 2018) (consent
order finding violation of Section 4g of the Act and Regulations 1.31 and 1.35 for failures
regarding audit trail data); Jn re E*Trade Sec. LLC, CFTC No. 17-07, 2017 WL 413517, at *4
(Jan. 26, 2017) (same).

The facts set forth above demonstrate that Respondent failed to promptly produce reliable
audit trail data to the Division during the Relevant Period. The Commission considers the
particular facts and circumstances of each case when assessing potential violations resulting from
production delays. The facts and circumstances here, where for nearly three years Respondent
failed to produce reliable required records to the Division, are sufficient for the Commission to

3
determine that a violation occurred. These failures substantially delayed the Division’s
investigation, and thus illustrate the importance of complying with the production requirements
of the Act and Regulations. On these facts, Respondent violated Section 4g of the Act and
Regulations 1.31 and 1.35.

B. Supervision Failures

Respondent violated Regulation 166.3 because it failed to develop and diligently
administer adequate procedures to ensure compliance with the production requirements of
Section 4g of the Act and Regulations 1.31 and 1.35.

Regulation 166.3 requires each registered FCM to “diligently supervise the handling by
its partners, officers, employees, and agents . . . of all commodity interests carried, operated,
advised or introduced by the registrant and other activities .. . relating to its business as a
Commission registrant.” 17 C.F.R. § 166.3 (2018). “A violation of Regulation 166.3 is
demonstrated by showing that either: (1) the registrant’s supervisory system was generally
inadequate; or (2) the registrant failed to perform its supervisory duties diligently.” See ABN
AMRO Clearing Chicago, 2018 WL 4502261 at *4 (collecting cases).

Under Section 4g of the Act and Regulations 1.31 and 1.35, FCMs have an obligation to
keep and promptly produce required records, including audit trail data. During the Relevant
Period, Respondent lacked an adequate system to properly respond to the Division’s requests for
required audit trail data, and otherwise failed to adequately supervise its employees and agents to
ensure the required records were properly kept and promptly produced. As a result of this
failure, Respondent did not promptly produce reliable data to the Division, and thus failed to
meet its production responsibilities under the Act and Regulations. Accordingly, Respondent
violated Regulation 166.3.

IV. FINDINGS OF VIOLATIONS

Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that, during the Relevant Period,
Respondent violated Section 4g of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 6g (2012), and Regulations 1.31, 1.35, and
166.3, 17 C.F.R. §§ 1.31, 1.35, and 166.3 (2018).
