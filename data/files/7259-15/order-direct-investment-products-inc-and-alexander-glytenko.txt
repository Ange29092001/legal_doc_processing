UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA

UNITED STATES COMMODITY Case No. 13-cv-02887-BAS(MDD)
FUTURES TRADING
COMMISSION, ORDER GRANTING MOTION
FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT
Plaintiff,
Vv. (ECF No. 86)
DIRECT INVESTMENT
PRODUCTS, INC., and
ALEXANDER GLYTENKO,
Defendants.

 

 

Plaintiff United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission
(“Commission”) commenced this action on December 5, 2013 by filing a complaint
against Defendants Direct Investment Products, Inc. (“DIP”) and Alexander
Glytenko (“Glytenko”’). The Commission contends DIP and Glytenko violated the
Commodity Exchange Act (“Act”) in the course of perpetrating a fraudulent
investment scheme targeting residents of various countries formerly part of the Soviet
Union. (See ECF No. 1.)

Pending before the Court is the Commission’s Motion for Default Judgment
against DIP and Glytenko. (ECF No. 86.) The Court finds this motion suitable for

determination on the papers submitted and without oral argument. See Civ. L.R.

Case 3:13-cv-02887-BAS-MDD Document 91 Filed 09/21/15 Page 2 of 22

7.1(d)(1). For the reasons set forth below, the Court GRANTS the Commission’s
motion, permanently enjoining both Defendants from engaging in further violations
of the Act, banning them from future trading or registration, and ordering payment of
restitution and civil monetary penalties.

I. BACKGROUND

Because of the entry of default, the following well-pleaded allegations from
the complaint are deemed admitted. See TeleVideo Systems, Inc. v. Heidenthal, 826
F.2d 915, 917 (9th Cir. 1987); see also DirecTV, Inc. v. Hoa Huynh, 503 F.3d 847,
854 (9th Cir. 2007).

Defendant DIP is a California corporation with its principal place of business
in Carlsbad, California. (ECF No. 1 (‘“Compl.”) at J 12.) “DIP has been registered
with the Commission as a Commodity Trading Advisor [“CTA”] and as a
Commodity Pool Operator [“CPO”] since April 2007.” Cd.) Defendant Glytenko
“is the Chief Executive Officer and a controlling person of DIP.” (/d. at § 13, Ex. 1
at ¢ 30.) Since March 2007, Glytenko has been a Principal and a registered
Associated Person (“AP”) of DIP. (/d.) Glytenko has also been a Principal and
registered AP of Institutional Capital Management, LLC, another registered CPO,
since March 2007. Cd.)

From roughly 2005 through 2010, DIP and Glytenko defrauded 761 residents
of Russia and various republics of the former Soviet Union out of $3.9 million. (Ud.
at ] 14.) Defendants DIP and Glytenko convinced these individuals to participate in
a commodity pool known as DIP Capital Partners (the “Pool”), which “traded in
futures and options on commodities, indices, currencies, treasury bonds and notes,
and metals.” (/d.) Glytenko created and directed DIP Consulting in order to attract
individuals to participate in the Pool. (/d. at ¥ 15.)

A. “Educational Seminars”

DIP Consulting conducted “educational seminars” in cities throughout the

former Soviet Union, where it presented promotional materials about DIP, the Pool,

Case 3:13-cv-02887-BAS-MDD Document 91 Filed 09/21/15 Page 3 of 22

and funds being traded on behalf of the Pool. (/d. at 416.) Glytenko, directly or
through DIP, provided material used in and approved of the promotional materials,
in addition to participating directly in these seminars. (/d. at 17.) The information
provided at these seminars misrepresented and omitted material facts about the Pool’s
record, in order to induce participants’ investment. (/d. at 7 18.) In particular,
Defendants provided the participants with three charts, each of which portrayed the
Pool or its constituent funds as profitable.! (/d. at J 18-20.) Based on the charts
provided, participants were led to believe the Pool realized annual profits of up to
nearly 50% during the period from 2003 to 2008. (/d. at { 18.)

Despite Defendants’ sunny representations about the Pool’s profitability from
2003 to 2008, the reality was that the Pool had not even existed until 2005. (Ud. at J
21.) Further, according to financial statements filed with the National Futures
Association, the ICF Fund constituent of the Pool actually experienced losses, rather
than gains, in 2007 and 2008. (/d. at J 22.) Additionally, none of the performance
figures on the charts presented at the meeting reflected actual trading done by the
Pool. (/d. at 423.) In fact, the figures reflected the theoretical performance of DIP’s
proprietary trading strategy (“DI-Portfolio”). Ud.) Defendants, however, failed to
provide any disclaimer with the charts to inform prospective participants that the
performance presented was theoretical, rather than actual. (/d.)

B. www.Di-Holding.com

From approximately 2005 to 2010, Defendants DIP and Glytenko maintained
www.di-holding.com. (Ud. at | 26.) Through a password-protected portal on the
website, Defendants provided Pool participants with ongoing daily access to
information about the performance of the Pool and its net asset value. (J/d.)

Defendant Glytenko created and provided various information posted on the website,

 

One chart represented annual profits and profit growth for the Pool
between 2003 and 2008. (Compl. at § 18.) A second and third made the same
representations regarding two of the Pool’s funds—the DI-Growth and ICF Funds—
between 2004 and 2008. (/d. at JJ 19-20.)

Case 3:13-cv-02887-BAS-MDD Document 91 Filed 09/21/15 Page 4 of 22

as well as reviewed and verified information prior to its posting. (/d.)

The information posted on the password-protected portion of the website
included charts showing profitable returns for the DI-Portfolio strategy going back as
far as 2002. (/d. at ] 27.) Contrary to the representations in these charts, however,
the Pool was not profitable in 2002, 2003 or 2004, since the Pool did not even exist
until 2005. (/d. at § 28.) Moreover, the performance figures represented theoretical
performance of the DI-Portfolio strategy, rather than actual trading. (/d.) Defendants
failed to include any disclaimer on these charts informing prospective participants
that the performance represented was only theoretical. (/d.)

In addition to the charts, Defendants also provided information on the
protected portion of the website regarding the Pool’s net asset value. (/d. at | 29.)
Defendants learned in or about late 2008 that one of the funds in which the Pool was
invested had sustained substantial losses, which would have a significant impact on
the net asset-value of the Pool. (/d.) However, Defendants failed for several months
thereafter to update the Pool’s net asset value calculation or to inform the participants
of the losses. (/d.) Rather, Defendants continued to provide participants with false
net asset value calculations for several months, even redeeming some participants’
interests in the Pool based on the false calculations. (/d.)

C.  Glytenko’s $464,000 Personal Loan

As a result of losses incurred by the Pool in late 2008, Defendants instituted a
freeze on the participants’ withdrawal of funds from the Pool. (/d. at { 32.) During
the freeze, in November 2009, Glytenko made a loan of $464,000 to himself from the
participants’ funds. (/d. at § 33.) Under the terms of the loan, the sole restraint on
Glytenko’s use of the funds was a requirement for repayment within 5 years. (/d.)
The participants remain unable to withdraw their funds from the Pool. (/d. at 4 34.)

D. Procedural History

The Commission completed service of the summons and complaint on

Defendants on March 3, 2014. (ECF Nos. 25, 26.) Defendants failed to answer or

otherwise respond. On the Commission’s request, the Clerk of the Court entered
Defendants’ default on May 9, 2014. (ECF No. 75.)

The Commission now moves for default judgment and requests a permanent
injunction, restitution in the amount of the participants’ losses, and significant civil
monetary penalties. (ECF No. 86-1 (“Mot.”) at 35, 39-41.) Specifically, the
Commission requests default judgment that Defendants violated Section
4b(a)(1)(A){(C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 6b(a)(1)(A){C), as amended; Section 4o, 7
U.S.C. §60; and Commission Regulation 4.41(b), 17 C.F.R. § 4.41(b). (Mot. at 18-
30.) To remedy these violations, the Commission requests the following:

® apermanent injunction barring Defendants from engaging in any further
violations of the Act and imposing trading and registration bans against
Defendants;
e restitution of $2,459,633; and
e acivil monetary penalty of $1,392,000.
(Mot. at 37:15~39:8; 41:18; 43:13.)
Ii. STATEMENT OF LAW

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 55(b)(2) governs applications for default
judgment. See Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 55(b)(2). Default judgment is available as long as
the plaintiff establishes that: (1) the defendants have been served with the summons
and complaint, and default was entered for their failure to appear; (2) the defendant
is neither a minor nor an incompetent person; (3) the defendant is not in military
service or otherwise subject to the Soldiers and Sailors Relief Act of 1940; and (4) if
the defendant has appeared in the action, that the defendant was provided with notice
of the application for default judgment at least three days prior to the hearing. /d.

Entry of default judgment is left to the trial court’s sound discretion. See
Aldabe v. Aldabe, 616 F.2d 1089, 1092 (9th Cir. 1980). Thus, a defendant’s default
does not automatically entitle the plaintiff to court-ordered judgment. See id. In the

Ninth Circuit, courts consider the following factors in deciding whether to enter

default judgment:
(1) the possibility of prejudice to the plaintiff, (2) the merits of
plaintiff's substantive claim, (3) the sufficiency of the complaint, (4)
the sum of money at stake in the action; (5) the possibility of a dispute
concerning material facts; (6) whether the default was due to excusable
neglect, and (7) the strong policy underlying the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure favoring decisions on the merits.

Ejitel vy. McCool, 782 F.2d 1470, 1471-72 (9th Cir. 1986).

“The general rule ... is that upon default the factual allegations of the
complaint, except those relating to the amount of damages, will be taken as true.”
Geddes v. United Fin. Grp., 559 F.2d 557, 560 (9th Cir. 1977) (citing Pope v. United
States, 323 U.S. 1, 12 (1944)). The court may conduct a hearing to fix the amount of
damages. Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 55(b)(2). However, where the amount of damages
claimed is a liquidated sum or capable of mathematical calculation, the court may
enter a default judgment without a hearing. Davis v. Fendler, 650 F.2d 1154, 1161
(9th Cir. 1981) (citation omitted).

Il. DISCUSSION

A. Jurisdiction and Venue

The Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Section 6c of the Act.
See 7 U.S.C. §§ 13a-1. Section 6c(a) authorizes the Commission to seek injunctive
relief in federal district court against any person who appears to have engaged, or be
about to engage, in any violations of the Act or “any rule, regulation, or order
thereunder.” 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1(a). Under Section 6c(e), venue is appropriate in the
district “wherein the defendant is found or is an inhabitant or transacts business[,] or
in the district where the act or practice occurred, is occurring, or is about to occur.”
7 USS.C. § 13a-1(e).

At the time the Complaint was filed in this case, Defendant DIP’s principal
place of business and Defendant Glytenko’s last known address were in the Southern
District of California. (Compl. at Jf 12-13.) Thus, this Court has authority to decide

the matter.

B.  Eitel Analysis

As a threshold matter, the Commission has established that both Defendants
have been served with the summons and complaint, have failed to appear, and are not
disqualified on the basis of age, incompetency, or military service. See Fed. R. Civ.
Pro. 55(b)(2). However, as a defendant’s default does not automatically entitle the
plaintiff to court-ordered judgment, the Court examines the Eite/ factors to determine
whether default judgment is appropriate. See Eitel, 782 F.2d 1470.

1. Prejudice to Plaintiff

The first Eite/ factor considers whether the plaintiff will suffer prejudice if
default judgment is not entered. A plaintiff will suffer prejudice if, absent default
judgment, the plaintiff would “be denied the right to judicial resolution of the claims
presented, and would be without other recourse for recovery.” Elektra Entm’t Grp.
v. Crawford, 226 F.R.D. 388, 392 (C.D. Cal. 2005). Defendants have failed to take
any action with respect to the Commission’s complaint, and the Commission is
without any other recourse for recovery. Thus, the Court finds that denial of default
judgment would be prejudicial to the Commission.

2. Merits of Plaintiff's Substantive Claims and Sufficiency of
Complaint

In order to obtain default judgment, the plaintiff must state a claim upon which
it can recover. See Abney v. Alameida, 334 F. Supp. 2d 1221, 1235 (S.D. Cal. 2004)
(denying a motion for default judgment where the claim was legally insufficient).
While the court takes the “well-pleaded factual allegations” of the complaint as true,
a “defendant is not held to admit facts that are not well-pleaded or to admit
conclusions of law.” DirecTV, Inc., 503 F.3d at 854 (citations omitted). The Court
examines each of the Commission’s claims to determine whether the Commission
has well-pleaded facts sufficient to justify recovery, or whether the complaint merely

recites legal conclusions.

a. Counts One --Three: violations of § 4b(a)(1)(A}{C)

The Commission alleges Defendants violated Section 4b(a)(1)(A)-(C) of the
Act, 7 U.S.C. § 6b(a)(1)(A)-(C), as amended, by “misrepresentations and omissions
of material fact, issuance of false statements, and misappropriation of pool participant
funds.” (Mot. at 18:18-22.)

The Act exists to regulate commodity pools and their operators, in part for the
purpose of “protecting . . . market participants from fraudulent or other abusive sales
practices and misuses of customer assets.” 7 U.S.C. § 5(b). The Commission brings
this suit under the portion of the Act making it unlawful:

for any person, in or in connection with any order to make, or the
making of, any contract of sale of any commodity for future delivery,
or swap, that is made, or to be made, for or on behalf of, or with, any
other person...

(A) to cheat or defraud or attempt to cheat or defraud the other person;
(B) willfully to make or cause to be made to the other person any false
report or statement or willfully to enter or cause to be entered for the
other person any false record; [or]

(C) willfully to deceive or attempt to deceive the other person by any
means whatsoever in regard to any order or contract or the disposition
or execution of any order or contract, or in regard to any act of agency
performed, with respect to any order or contract for or, in the case of
paragraph (2), with the other person[.]

7 U.S.C. §6b(a)(2)(A)(C).?

To establish liability, the Commission “must establish that Defendants made a
material misrepresentation or omission with scienter.” Commodity Futures Trading
Comm’n y. Driver, 877 F. Supp. 2d 968, 977 (C.D. Cal. 2012), aff'd 585 F. App’x
366 (9th Cir. 2014) (citing Commodity Futures Trading Comm'n v. R.J. Fitzgerald
& Co., 310 F.3d 1321, 1328-29 (11th Cir. 2002)). A statement or omission is

 

2 As the Commission notes, two amendments to the statute took place
during the period between 2008 and 2011; while the subsections were renumbered,
this language remained materially the same. See Dodd—Frank Act of 2010, Pub. L.
No. 111-203, § 741, 124 Stat. 1376, 1730-3; Food, Conservation, & Energy Act of
2008, Pub. L. No. 110-234, § 13,102, 122 Stat. 923, 1432-33.

material if “it is substantially likely that a reasonable investor would consider the
matter important in making an investment decision.” /d. (citing TSC Indus. v.
Northway, Inc., 426 U.S. 438, 449 (1976)). Notably, misrepresentations of profit and
risk are material. See R.J. Fitzgerald & Co., 310 F.3d at 1332-33. Further, to prove
scienter, there must be “evidence that a [d]efendant committed the alleged wrongful
acts intentionally, or ‘that the representations were made with a reckless disregard for
their truth or falsity.” Driver, 877 F. Supp. 2d at 977, aff'd 585 F. App’x 366
(internal citation omitted).
i. Count One: Fraudulent Solicitation at Seminars

The Court finds the Commission has pleaded facts sufficient to find
Defendants’ solicitations during their “educational seminars” violated Section
4(b)(a)(1) of the Act. In particular, Defendants illegally, with at least a reckless
disregard for the truth, presented participants with the following material
information, in PowerPoint presentations:

e profitable performance figures for various funds in years when
Defendants knew the Pool did not exist;

e hypothetical trading performance without labeling it as such; and

e at least two years of profitable performance results for one of the Pool’s
funds when, in fact, that fund had experienced losses.

DIP is liable for the actions of Glytenko, who approved of and provided
information for the promotional materials used, and directly participated, in the
seminars. Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act provides that an entity is liable for the “act,
omission, or failure of any official, agent, or other person acting for [it] . . . within
the scope of his employment or office.” 7 U.S.C. § 2(a)(1)(B). “Whether one person
is an agent acting for another turns . . . on an overall assessment of the totality of the
circumstances in each case.” Stotler & Co. v. Commodity Futures Trading Comm’n,
855 F.2d 1288, (7th Cir. 1988) (internal citations omitted). As CEO and director,

Glytenko acted on behalf of DIP when he participated in the educational seminars,

aimed toward soliciting investors to participate in the Pool. (See ECF No. 86-5 at
Ex. 4, 58:9-12.)
ii. Count Two: Fraud by Misappropriation

The Court finds the Commission has pleaded facts sufficient to find
Defendants liable for Glytenko’s personal loan to himself from the participants’
funds. Misappropriation of funds entrusted to one for trading purposes is a “willful
and blatant” fraud, in violations of Section 4(b)(a)(1)(A) and (C) of the Act. Driver,
877 F. Supp. 2d at 978, aff'd 585 F. App’x 366 (quoting Commodity Futures Trading
Comm’n v. Weinberg, 287 F. Supp. 2d 1100, 1106 (C.D. Cal. 2003)).

Glytenko’s active participation in the misappropriation of participant funds
makes him liable for violating the Act. Further, as discussed above, DIP is liable for
Glytenko’s misappropriation, as he was acting in the scope of his employment. See
Commodity Futures Trading Comm'n vy. Raleigh Capital Mgmt., No. CIV.A. 09-
6780, 2011 WL 2268956, at *3 (N.D. Ill. May 12, 2011) (holding a principal’s
misappropriation of fund money for personal loans created liability under the Act,
since principal was acting “within the scope of his employment.”).

iii. Count Three: Fraudulent Representations Online

The Court finds the Commission has pleaded facts sufficient to find
Defendants’ representations on the password-protected portion of www.di-
holding.com violated Section 4(b)(a)(1) of the Act. In particular, Defendants
illegally, and knowingly or with reckless disregard for the truth, used the website to
communicate the following misrepresentations and omissions of material facts:

e the performance history of the DI-Portfolio trading strategy, and
e false and inaccurate net asset value calculations for the Pool.

Glytenko was acting within the scope of his employment when he used his
control over DIP’s operations to create and approve of false statements on the website
in order to retain participants in the Pool. As discussed earlier, DIP is thus vicariously

liable for these violations.

b. Count 4: violations of Section 40(1)(A)(B)
The Commission alleges Defendants violated Section 40(1)(A){B) of the Act,
7 U.S.C. §60. Section 40(1) prohibits a commodity pool operator or its associated

person from the following:

[U]s[ing] . . . the mails or any means or instrumentality of
interstate commerce, directly or indirectly—

(A) to employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud any
client or participant or prospective client or participant; or

(B) to engage in any transaction, practice, or course of business
which operates as a fraud or deceit upon any client or participant or
prospective client or participant.

7 U.S.C. §60.

Under the Act, a commodity pool operator is any person who is registered with
the Commission as such or who is “engaged in a business that is of the nature of a
commodity pool ... or similar form of enterprise, and who, in connection therewith,
solicits, accepts, or receives from others, funds . . . for the purpose of trading in
commodity interests[.]” 7 U.S.C. § la(11)(A). An associated person is a natural
person who is associated with a commodity pool operator “as a partner, officer,
employee, consultant, or agent . . . in any capacity which involves . . . the solicitation
of funds, securities, or property for a participation in a commodity pool or . . . the
supervision of any person or persons so engaged[.]” 17 C.F.R. § 1.3(aa)(3).

The pleaded facts establish DIP was registered as a commodity pool operator
with the Commission beginning in 2007, and that, before then, it fell within the
statutory definition by soliciting and accepting funds to participate in futures trading.
Similarly, Glytenko was registered as an associated person of DIP since early 2007
and, before that, acted as an associated person by assisting DIP and supervising others
at DIP in soliciting funds for participation in the Pool.

The Court finds that Defendants violated Section 40(1) of the Act by the use
of www.di-holding.com to issue false statements and make material omissions

regarding the performance of the Pool. Glytenko provided information for and

verified the content of the internet site and, therefore, is liable for its
misrepresentations. As discussed above, since he was acting as an agent for DIP at
the time, this liability is extended to DIP.

c. Count 5: violations of Commission Regulation 4.41(b)

The Commission alleges Defendants violated Commission Regulation 4.41(b),
governing advertising by commodity pool operators and their principals. See 17
C.F.R. § 4.41(b). That regulation provides that “[n]o person may present the
performance of any simulated or hypothetical commodity interest account,
transaction in a commodity interest or series of transactions in a commodity interest
of acommodity pool operator, commodity trading advisor, or any principal thereof,”
unless the presentation is accompanied by an “immediately proximate” statement that
the results are hypothetical, not actual. /d.

The Court finds the pleaded facts establish that Defendants presented
hypothetical performance results to potential participants in their “educational
seminars” as inducement to invest, as well as to actual customers in the protected
portion of www.di-holding.com. These activities violated Regulation 4.41(b), as
Defendants failed to provide a disclaimer that the results were not actual, but
theoretical.

Like Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 17 C.F.R. § 1.2 creates liability for an entity
on the basis of the “act, omission, or failure of any official, agent, or other person
acting ... within the scope of his employment or office.” 17 C.F.R. § 1.2. DIP is
thus liable for its own actions, as well as those of Glytenko, which violated § 4.41(b).

3. Sum of Money at Stake

“Under the third Fitel factor, the court must consider the amount of money at
stake in relation to the seriousness of [the] [d]efendant’s conduct.” PepsiCo, Inc. v.
Cal. Sec. Cans, 238 F. Supp. 2d 1172, 1176 (C.D. Cal. 2002). The sum of money at
stake here is not insignificant: the Commission seeks restitution of $2,459,633 in
addition to a civil monetary penalty of $1,392,000. (Mot. at 41:18; 43:13.) While

substantial, the sum requested is not unreasonable. Rather, the Commission seeks
approximately the same amount Defendants solicited from the investors. As the sum
of money at stake is reasonable considering the seriousness of Defendants’ conduct,
the Court finds this factor favors granting default judgment. See Commodity Futures
Trading Comm’n v. Gustaveson, No. C12-04519 HRL, 2013 WL 6578992, at *4
(N.D. Cal. Aug. 19, 2013) (granting default judgment, including imposing
$1,230,000 in penalties against defendant, based on tripling the amount defendant
retained from his clients).
4. Possibility of Disputed Facts or Excusable Neglect
Defendants have failed to make an appearance in this action. Thus, the well-
pleaded facts in the Commission’s complaint are taken as true. No dispute has been
raised by Defendants; neither have they made any claim of excusable neglect in the
period of time since the entry of default judgment four months ago. Both these factors
weigh in favor of granting default judgment.
5. Policy Favoring Decisions on the Merits
Although there is a policy favoring decisions on the merits when possible, this
factor is not alone dispositive. Cal. Sec. Cans, 238 F. Supp. 2d at 1177. Since the
other Eite/ factors support default judgment, the Court finds default judgment is
appropriate in this case.
C. Remedies
1. Permanent Injunctive Relief
The Commission seeks permanent injunctive relief against Defendants under
Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1, prohibiting future violations. To obtain
permanent injunctive relief, the Commission must establish a violations as well as
“some reasonable likelihood of future violations.” Commodity Futures Trading
Comm'n v. Hunt, 591 F.2d 1211, 1220 (7th Cir. 1979) (internal citations omitted).
“While past misconduct does not lead necessarily to the conclusion that there is a

likelihood of future misconduct, it is ‘highly suggestive of the likelihood of future

violations.’” Jd. (quoting SEC v. Mgmt. Dynamics, Inc., 515 F.2d 801, 807 (2d Cir.
1975).

Defendants perpetrated a transcontinental scheme, swindling over 700 citizens
of former republics of the Soviet Union out of nearly $4 million dollars. To advance
the scheme, Defendants made numerous misrepresentations, including representing
hypothetical trading performance as actual results, portraying the Pool as profitable
during years when it did not even exist, and failing to incorporate significant losses
in the calculation of the Pool’s net asset value. Defendants, further, misappropriated
$464,000 of the participants’ funds as a personal loan to Glytenko. As such, the Court
finds Defendants’ past fraudulent misconduct makes it highly likely that Defendants
will continue to commit violations of the Act and Commission Regulations unless a
permanent injunction is granted.

Accordingly, the Court GRANTS a permanent injunction, trading ban, and
registration ban against Defendants DIP and Glytenko, consistent with the language
contained in the Commission’s Proposed Order filed concurrently with its Motion.

2. Restitution

The Commission requests restitution, also pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, to
be measured by “the difference between what defendants obtained and the amount
customers received back, but [not including] payments to customers that exceeded
their principal.” 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1; Driver, 877 F. Supp. 2d at 981, aff'd 585 F. App’x
366 (internal citation omitted).

The Commission has submitted evidence in support of its request for
$2,459,633 in restitution. (See ECF No. 86-2 at Ex. 1 (Decl. of Michelle Bougas), J]
43-44 (stating participants deposited $3,999,300, of which Defendants returned
$1,539,667).) The Court finds this amount reasonable to return the participants to
status quo and therefore GRANTS the Commission’s request for restitution.

3. Civil Monetary Penalties
The Commission requests the Court order Defendants to pay civil penalties in
the amount of $1,392,000, triple the $464,000 misappropriated by Defendants.
Under Section 6c(d) of the Act:

the court shall have jurisdiction to impose, on a proper showing, on any
person found in the action to have committed any violations... a civil
penalty in the amount of not more than the greater of $100,000° or triple
the monetary gain to the person for each violations.

7 U.S.C. § 13a-1(d)(1).

As noted above, Defendants’ misappropriation of client funds occurred after
Defendants put a freeze on the participants’ funds. Further, the terms of the loan to
Glytenko left him virtually unfettered to use the funds for any purpose, solely
requiring him to repay the loan after five years.

In these circumstances, the Court finds a civil monetary penalty of $1,392,000,
or triple the amount misappropriated, to be appropriate. Therefore, the Commission’s
request is GRANTED.

IV. CONCLUSION

In light of the foregoing, the Court GRANTS the Commission’s motion for
default judgment (ECF No. 86) and ORDERS the Clerk of Court to enter judgment
as follows:

A. Permanent Injunction

Based on the foregoing, Defendants DIP and Glytenko are hereby permanently
enjoined from directly or indirectly engaging in conduct in violations of Sections
4b(a)(1)(AH{C) and 40(1)(A) & (B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. §§ 6b(a)(1)(A){C),
60(1)(A) & (B); and Commission Regulation 4.41(b), 17 C.F.R. § 4.41(b).

Defendants are also permanently enjoined from the following:

 

> The Commission passed regulations fixing this amount at $130,000 per
violations for acts before October 23, 2008, and $140,000 per violations for acts on or
after October 23, 2008. See C.F.R. § 143.8(a)(1).

or required to be registered with the Commission except as
provided for in Commission Regulation 4.14(a)(9), 17 C.F.R. §
4.14(a)(9).

B. Restitution and Civil Monetary Penalty

1. Restitution

Defendants shall be jointly and severally liable for, and shall pay, restitution
in the amount of two million, four hundred fifty-nine thousand, six hundred thirty-
three dollars ($2,459,633) (“Restitution Obligation”), plus post-judgment interest.
Post-judgment interest shall accrue on the Restitution Obligation beginning on the
date of entry of this Order and shall be determined by using the Treasury Bill rate
prevailing on the date of the entry of this Order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1961.

To effect payment of the Restitution Obligation and the distribution of any
restitution payments to Defendants’ pool participants, the Court appoints the National
Futures Association (“NFA”) as Monitor. The Monitor shall collect restitution
payments from Defendants and make distributions as set forth below. Because the
Monitor is acting as an officer of this Court in performing these services, the NFA
shall not be liable for any action or inaction arising from NFA’s appointment as
Monitor, other than actions involving fraud.

Defendants shall make Restitution Obligation payments under this Order to the
Monitor in the name “Direct Investment Products Restitution Fund” and shall send
such Restitution Obligation payments by electronic funds transfer, or by U.S. postal
money order, certified check, bank cashier’s, or bank money order, to the Office of
Administration, National Futures Association, 300 South Riverside Plaza, Suite

1800, Chicago, Illinois 60606 under a cover letter that identifies the Defendant

making payment and the name and docket number of this proceeding. Defendants
shall simultaneously transmit copies of the cover letter and the form of payment to
the Chief Financial Officer, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Three
Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20581.

Any financial institution holding funds of Defendants is directed to liquidate
and release all such funds, whether the funds are held in a single or joint account, or
in any other capacity, and to convey them (minus any amounts to cover the financial
institution’s administrative or wire transfer fees) by wire transfer to an account
designated by the Monitor within thirty (30) days of receiving a copy the this Order.
At no time during the liquidation, release, and /or wire transfer of these funds
pursuant to this Order shall Defendants be afforded any access to, or be provided
with, any of these funds. Defendants, and all financial institutions subject to this
Order, shall cooperate fully with the Commission and the Monitor in the liquidation,
release, and wire transfer of these funds.

The Monitor shall oversee the Restitution Obligation and shall have the
discretion to determine the manner of distribution of such funds in an equitable
fashion to Defendants’ pool participants identified by the Monitor and/or the
Commission or may defer distribution until such time as the Monitor deems
appropriate. In the event that the amount of Restitution Obligation payments to the
Monitor are of a de minimis nature such that the Monitor determines that the
administrative cost of making a distribution to eligible poo! participants is
impractical, the Monitor may, in its discretion, treat such restitution payments as civil
monetary penalty payments, which the Monitor shall forward to the Commission
following the instructions for civi] monetary penalty payments set forth below.

Defendants shall cooperate with the Monitor as appropriate to provide such
information as the Monitor deems necessary and appropriate to identify Defendants’
pool participants to whom the Monitor, in its sole discretion, may determine to

include in any plan for distribution of any Restitution Obligation payments.

Defendants shall execute any documents necessary to release funds that they have in
any repository, bank, investment, or other financial institution, wherever located, in
order to make partial or total payment toward the Restitution Obligation.

Any amounts paid to any pool participant shall not limit the ability of that poo!
participant from proving that a greater amount is owed from Defendants or any other
person or entity, and nothing herein shall be construed in any way to limit or abridge
the rights of any pool participant that exist under state or common law. Pursuant to
Rule 71 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, each poo! participant of Defendants
who suffered a loss is explicitly made an intended third-party beneficiary of this
Order and may seek to enforce obedience of this Order to obtain satisfaction of any
portion of the restitution that has not been paid by Defendants to ensure continued
compliance with any provision of this Order and to hold Defendants in contempt for
any violations of any provision of this Order.

To the extent that any funds accrue to the U.S. Treasury for satisfaction of
Defendants’ Restitution Obligation, such funds shall be transferred to the Monitor for
disbursement in accordance with the procedures set forth above.

2. Civil Monetary Penalty

Defendants shall be jointly and severally liable for, and shall pay, a civil
monetary penalty of one million, three hundred ninety-two thousand dollars
($1,392,000) within ten (10) days of the date of entry of this Order (“CMP
Obligation’), plus post-judgment interest. Post-judgment interest shall accrue on the
CMP Obligation beginning on the date of entry of this Order and shall be determined
by using the Treasury Bill rate prevailing on the date of entry of this Order pursuant
to 28 U.S.C. § 1961.

Defendants shall pay their CMP Obligation by electronic funds transfer, U.S.
postal money order, certified check, bank cashier’s check, or bank money order. If
payment is to be made other than by electronic funds transfer, then the payment shall

be made payable to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and sent to the
