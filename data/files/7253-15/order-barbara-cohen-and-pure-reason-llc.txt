ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTIONS 6(c) AND 6(d) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, AS AMENDED,
MAKING FINDINGS AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

1

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“Commission”) has reason to believe that
on October 22, 2014, Barbara Cohen (“Cohen”) violated Section 6(c)(2) of the Commodity
Exchange Act, as amended (“Act”), 7 U.S.C. § 9(2) (2012) and during the period from March
2012 to January 2013 (“2012-2013 period’) Cohen violated Commission Regulation 4.41(b), 17
C.F.R. § 4.41(b) (2014), pursuant to § 13(b) of the Act, 7 USC §13c(b). Also, during the 2012-
2013 period, Pure Reason, LLC (“Pure Reason”) violated Regulation 4.41(b), 17 C.F.R. §
4.41(b) (2014). Therefore, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest that
public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted to determine whether Cohen and
Pure Reason (collectively, “Respondents”) engaged in the violations set forth herein and to
determine whether any order should be issued imposing remedial sanctions.

Il.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Respondents have
submitted an Offer of Settlement (“Offer”), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Without admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, Respondents consent to
the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 6(c) and 6(d) of the
Commodity Exchange Act, as Amended, Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions
(“Order”) and acknowledge service of this Order. !

 

Respondents consent to the entry of this Order and to the use of these findings in this proceeding and in
any other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party; provided,
however, that Respondents do not consent to the use of the Offer, or the findings or conclusions in this
Order consented to in the Offer, as the sole basis for any other proceeding brought by the Commission,
other than in a proceeding in bankruptcy or to enforce the terms of this Order. Nor do Respondents

 
TI.
The Commission finds the following:
A. SUMMARY

In connection with the Commission’s investigation of Respondents, on October 22, 2014,
Cohen knowingly made false and misleading statements to Commission staff while testifying
under oath. Cohen falsely testified that she was authorized to trade and traded an account that
she never in fact traded or had any authority to trade.

Further, during the 2012-2013 period, Pure Reason’s website, which was developed and
maintained by Cohen, promoted Pure Reason’s trading software by demonstrating profitable
trading results without disclosing that these results were based on hypothetical, and not actual,
trading.

B. RESPONDENTS

Barbara Cohen, resides in Tarpon Springs, Florida. Cohen has been registered as an
associated person (“AP”) of Pure Reason since August 2007 and is an owner, principal and Chief
Operating Officer (“COO”) of Pure Reason. In addition, Cohen has been registered as an AP of
Vankar Trading Corporation (“Vankar’”) since May 2014, and is a branch manager and forex AP
of Vankar.

Pure Reason, LLC, has been registered in Florida as a limited liability company since
September 2005, has its principal place of business in Tarpon Springs, Florida, and has been
registered with the Commission as a commodity trading advisor (“CTA”) since August 2007.

C. FACTS

During the 2012-2013 period, Cohen developed and maintained a website on behalf of
Pure Reason, a registered CTA, to promote the sale of a software trading program and courses on
how to use the software. Cohen, a registered AP of Pure Reason, also is a principal, part owner,
and COO of Pure Reason.

Cohen was the prime author of the software program sold by Pure Reason, taught a
number of classes offered by Pure Reason and represented on the website that she had traded
crude oil products. Through this software, customers received indicators of market trends in
such products as e-mini futures contracts, crude oil futures contracts and foreign currency
transactions.

 

consent to the use of the Offer or this Order, or the findings or conclusions in this Order consented to in
the Offer, by any other party in any other proceeding.

 
The website, which contained links to weekly promotional webinars, also contained
demonstrations of trading profits earned during these webinars using Pure Reason’s software
program. These profitable trading results, however, were based on hypothetical trades and there
was no disclaimer on the website or during the webinars that these were not actual trading
results. Cohen testified that she was aware that these profitable trade results were based on
hypothetical trades.

False Statements Made To Commission

During the course of the Commission’s investigation of this matter, staff issued a demand
to Pure Reason to produce, in part, documents and/or other information substantiating claims on
Pure Reason’s website that Cohen had traded crude oil. In response, Pure Reason produced a
“Performance Summary” (“PS”) of a trading account from a futures commission merchant
(“FCM”) which according to counsel for Pure Reason and Cohen represented Cohen’s trading
history. The PS contained an account number but no account name. When staff contacted the
FCM for more information regarding this account, staff was informed that Cohen was not
associated with the account and was not authorized to trade the account.

On October 22, 2014, Cohen testified, under oath, regarding the PS produced by Pure
Reason to Commission staff. Cohen testified that only she and her partner were authorized to
trade the account on the PS. When asked if the trades listed on the PS were trades she placed,
Cohen falsely testified, “Some. Not all. He [Cohen’s partner] traded, I traded, depending on the
day and the time and who was trading ...”- Commission staff further confirmed from Cohen’s
partner that neither he nor Cohen was authorized to trade the account reflected on the PS and that
he never in fact placed any trades for this account.

LEGAL DISCUSSION

A. Cohen Violated Section 6(c)(2) Of The Act

Section 6(c)(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 9(2) (2012), provides that it is unlawful “for any
person to make any false or misleading statement of a material fact to the Commission . .. or to
omit to state in any such statement any material fact that is necessary to make any statement of
material fact made not misleading in any material respect, if the person knew, or reasonably
should have known, the statement to be false or misleading.” During investigative testimony,
while under oath, Cohen made false and misleading statements to Commission staff regarding
her trading of an account that she never traded and that she never was authorized to trade. Cohen
knew or reasonably should have known that her statements were both false and misleading.
Further, these statements were material because they went to the heart of a document that
Commission staff was analyzing pursuant to the Commission’s investigation of Respondents.

 
B. Pure Reason Violated Regulation 4.41(b)

Regulation 4.41(b), 17 C.F.R § 4.41(b), prohibits any person from presenting the
performance of any simulated or hypothetical commodity interest account, transaction or series
of transactions of a CTA unless the hypothetical disclaimer set forth in Regulation 4.41(b)(1)(i)
or (11) is disclosed. During the 2012-2013 period, Pure Reason, a registered CTA, promoted
profitable trading results from its software trading program on its website and webinars. These
profitable trading results, however, were based on hypothetical trades and there was no
disclaimer on the website or during the webinars that these were not actual trading results. By
this conduct, Pure Reason violated Regulation 4.41(b), 17 C.F.R § 4.41(b). CFTC v. Vartuli, 228
F.3d 94, 107 (2d Cir. 2000) (phrasing and placement of disclosure appeared designed to mislead
and violated Regulation 4.41(b)).

C, Derivative Liability

1. Cohen’s Controlling Person Liability

Cohen controlled Pure Reason and, as a controlling person, is liable for Pure Reason’s
violations of the Act and Regulations pursuant to Section 13(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 13c(b),
which provides that a person who, directly or indirectly, controls any person who has violated
any provision of the Act or any rule, regulation or order issued pursuant to the Act may be held
liable for such violation in any action brought by the Commission to the same extent as such
controlled person; the Commission has the burden of proving that the controlling person did not
act in good faith or knowingly induced, directly or indirectly, the act or acts constituting the
violation. See Monieson v. CFTC, 996 F.2d 852, 858 (7th Cir. 1993); CFTC vy. RL. Fitzgerald &
Co., 310 F.3d 1321, 1334 (11th Cir. 2002). A “fundamental purpose” of the statute is “to reach
behind the corporate entity to the controlling individuals of the corporation and to impose
liability for violations of the Act directly on such individuals as well as on the corporation itself.”
Id. (quoting JCC, Ine. v. CFTC, 63 F.3d 1557, 1567 (11th Cir. 1995)),

To establish controlling person liability under Section 13(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C,
§ 13c(b), the Commission must show (1) control; and (2) lack of good faith or knowing
inducement of the acts constituting the violation. See In re First Nat’l Trading Corp., [1992-
1994 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep, (CCH) 4 26,142, at 41,787 (CFTC July 20, 1994),
aff'd without opinion sub nom. Pick v. CFTC, 99 F.3d 1139 (6th Cir. 1996), To establish control,
a defendant must possess general control over the operation of the entity principally liable. See
RU. Fitzgerald, 310 F.3d at 1334. The Commission must show “that the defendant exercised
general control over the operation of the entity principally liable and possessed the power or ability
to control the specific transaction or activity upon which the primary violation was predicated, even
if such power was not exercised.” CFTC v. Int’l Fin. Services, Inc., 323 F, Supp. 2d 482, 504
(S.D.N.Y, 2004) (quoting CFTC v, Baragosh, 278 F.3d 319, 330 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 537 U.S.
950 (2002)). Control is “the possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the
direction of the management and policies of a person, whether through the ownership of voting
securities, by contract, or otherwise.” Jn re Spiegel, [1987-1990 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep.
(CCH) J 24,103, n.4 (CFTC Jan. 12, 1988). “Section [13(b)], therefore, is about power and imposing
liability for those who fail to exercise it to prevent illegal conduct.” RJ. Fitzgerald, 310 F.3d at
1334.

 
Cohen was an officer, principal, and part owner of Pure Reason and therefore had the
power to control Pure Reason, See In re Spiegel, [1987-1990 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L.
Rep. (CCH) 4 24,103, at 34,767 (CFTC Jan. 12, 1988); see also Apache Trading Corp., [1990-
1992 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) ¥ 25,251, at 38,795 (CFTC Mar. 11, 1992)
(finding that an individual controls a corporation where he “directs the economic aspects of the
firm’). In addition, Cohen was responsible for the content of Pure Reason’s website, and therefore
possessed the power or ability to control the specific transaction or activity upon which the violation
of Regulation 4.41(b) was predicated.

To establish the “knowing inducement” element of the controlling person violation, the
Commission must show that “the controlling person had actual or constructive knowledge of the
core activities that constitute the violations at issue and allowed them to continue.” JCC, Inc. v.
CFTC, 63 F.3d 1557, 1568 (11th Cir, 1995) (quoting In re Spiegel, [1987-1990 Transfer Binder]
Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) § 24,103, at 34,767 (CFTC Jan. 12, 1988)). In this case, Cohen was
an owner, COO and principal of Pure Reason and was responsible for developing and
maintaining Pure Reason’s website. Here, the website which Cohen controlled, had links to
webinars which displayed trading results without any hypothetical disclaimer. Further, Cohen
knew that these trading results were hypothetical and there was no disclaimer on the website or
during the webinars. Accordingly, Cohen knowingly induced, directly or indirectly, the conduct
that constitutes a violation of the Act. Consequently, pursuant to Section 13(b) of the Act,

7 U.S.C. § 13c(b), she is liable for Pure Reason’s violation of Regulation 4.41(b).

V.
FINDINGS OF VIOLATION

Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that, on October 22, 2014, Cohen violated
Section 6(c)(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 9(2) (2012) and during the 2012-2013 period, Cohen
violated Commission Regulation 4.41(b), 17 C.F.R. § 4.41(b) (2014), pursuant to § 13(b) of the
Act, 7 USC §13c(b). Also, during the 2012-2013 period, Pure Reason, LLC (“Pure Reason”)
violated Regulation 4.41(b), 17 C.F.R. § 4.41(b) (2014).
