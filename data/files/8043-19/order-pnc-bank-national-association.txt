ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTION 6(c) AND (d) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, MAKING
FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

I, INTRODUCTION

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“Commission”) has reason to believe that
from in or about January 2013 to November 1, 2018 (“Relevant Period”), PNC Bank, National
Association (“PNC” or “Respondent”) violated Sections 2(a)(13)(G), 4r(a)(3), and 4s(f) of the
Commodity Exchange Act (“Act” or “CEA”), 7 U.S.C. 8§ 2(a)(13)(G), 6r(a)(3), 6s(f) (2012),
and Commission Regulations (“Regulations”) 20.4, 20.7, 23.204, 43.3, 43.4, 45.3, 45.4, and
45.6, 17 C.F.R. §§ 20.4, 20.7, 23.204, 43.3, 43.4, 45.3, 45.4, 45.6 (2018). Therefore, the
Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest that public administrative
proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted to determine whether Respondent engaged in the
violations set forth herein and to determine whether any order should be issued imposing
remedial sanctions.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Respondent has
submitted an Offer of Settlement (“Offer”), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Without admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, Respondent consents to
the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Section 6(c) and (d) of the Commodity
Exchange Act, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (“Order”) and acknowledges
service of this Order,’

 

' Respondent consents to the use of the findings of fact and conclusions of law in this Order in this proceeding and
in any other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party or claimant, and agrees
that they shall be taken as true and correct and be given preclusive effect therein, without further proof. Respondent
does not consent, however, to the use of this Order, or the findings or conclusions herein, as the sole basis for any
other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party or claimant, other than: a
proceeding in bankruptcy or receivership; or a proceeding to enforce the terms of this Order. Respondent does not
consent to the use of the Offer or this Order, or the findings or conclusions in this Order, by any other party in any
other proceeding.
Il. FINDINGS
The Commission finds the following:
A. SUMMARY

As a provisionally registered swap dealer, PNC is required to comply with certain
reporting and recordkeeping requirements related to its swap transactions.

Section 4s(f) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 6s(f) (2012), and Regulation 20.4, 17 C.F.R. § 20.4
(2018), require swap dealers that meet certain requirements to file daily large trader reports for
reportable positions in physical commodity swaps (“LTRs”), which are populated with specific
data as directed by the Commission. The LTRs must also conform to the form and manner for
reporting and submitting information as set forth in Regulation 20.7, 17 C.F.R. § 20.7 (2018).

Pursuant to Regulation 23.204 and Part 45 of the Regulations, 17 C.F.R. § 23.204, pt. 45
(2018), swap dealers are required to report to a registered swap data repository (“SDR”) certain
swap transaction information, including primary economic terms of the transaction, the legal
entity identifier (“LEI”) of each counterparty, and accurate continuation data. Section
2(a)(13)(G) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 2(a)(13)(G) (2012), further requires parties to report swap
transaction information to an SDR in a timely manner, as prescribed by the Commission;
similarly, Section 4r(a)(3) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 6r(a)(3) (2012), requires swap dealers to report
swap transactions to a SDR within such time period as prescribed by the Commission. Part 43 of
the Regulations, 17 C.F.R. pt. 43 (2018), specifies requirements for real-time public reporting of
swap transactions.

At certain times during the Relevant Period, PNC failed to file LTRs for its physical
‘commodity swaps; failed to properly report LEIs, primary economic terms, and continuation data
to its SDR; and failed to timely report certain trades to its SDR.

* * *

In accepting PNC’s Offer, the Commission recognizes that PNC discovered and promptly
self-reported its violations to the Division of Enforcement (“Division”), provided substantial
cooperation during the Division’s investigation of this matter, and has taken extensive remedial
action to address its reporting deficiencies, as explained in more detail below. The Commission
notes that PNC’s self-reporting, cooperation, and remediation are recognized in the form of a
substantially reduced civil monetary penalty.

B. RESPONDENT

PNC is headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and has been provisionally registered
as a swap dealer with the Commission since January 31, 2013.
C. FACTS
1. Failure To Submit LTRs for Commodity Swaps

As a provisionally registered swap dealer, PNC is required to submit LTRs in the form
and manner determined by the Commission. However, between October 2015 and March 2018,
PNC did not submit any LTRs. As of April 4, 2018, PNC had open covered contracts consisting
of fifty or more futures equivalent paired swaps or swaptions with twenty-seven counterparties,
including counterparties that were not swap dealers.

PNC began submitting LTRs through a manual process on April 4, 2018, and automated
its submission of LTRs on April 24, 2018. By the end of June 2018, PNC had submitted historic
LTRs for the entire Relevant Period.

2. Failure To Report Primary Economic Terms

PNC is required to report required primary economic terms to an SDR. However, at
certain times during the Relevant Period, PNC submitted reports to its SDR, the Depository Trust
& Clearing Corporation Data Repository (U.S.) LLC (“DTCC”), in several different asset
classes—interest-rate derivatives, commodity swaps, and foreign exchange (“FX”) options,
forwards, and non-deliverable forwards (“NDFs”)-——that were missing a variety of required
fields.

As PNC disclosed to the Commission, PNC had, as of February 2018, failed to report one
or more of thirteen required data fields for tens of thousands of trades, including a minority that
remained on PNC’s books (“Live Trades”). Since March 5, 2018, PNC has included all thirteen
fields, as applicable, in its ongoing reports to DTCC, and by March 28, 2018, PNC had re-
reported to DTCC all of its Live Trades from the Relevant Period to include the thirteen required
fields.

However, PNC subsequently determined and disclosed to the Commission that some of
its reports were also deficient with respect to thirty additional unique fields. Since November 1,
2018, PNC has included in its ongoing reports to DTCC all required data fields, including the
thirty additional fields, as applicable, identified as a result of PNC’s internal review, and by
December 1, 2018, PNC had re-reported to DTCC all of its Live Trades from the Relevant
Period to include those thirty fields. PNC’s remediation of its reporting of trades no longer on
PNC’s books (“Dead Trades”) is ongoing. See infra Section VIE.

3. Failure To Accurately Report LEIs and Trade Modifications

PNC is required to report swap continuation data to ensure that all data concerning a
swap remains current and accurate, including by reporting life cycle event data or state data for
the swap, such as the LEI for a counterparty to a swap, if the LEI was not included in creation
data reporting, and trade modifications.

At certain times during the Relevant Period, PNC failed to report a valid LEI for certain
counterparties. An LE] is a unique 20-character alphanumeric code used to identify legally
distinct entities that act as counterparties to swap transactions, among other financial
transactions. From April 2015 through December 2017, PNC executed interest rate swaps with
counterparties that had not yet obtained an LEI and, when reporting those swaps to DTCC, PNC
used a unique internal PNC identifier (rather than an LEI) to identify the relevant counterparties.
When such a counterparty later obtained an LEI, PNC failed to update its reports to DTCC. This
issue affected several hundred trades, which PNC re-reported to DTCC by October 26, 2017,
when PNC implemented a process for manually updating trade reporting for any LEI exceptions.
On December 8, 2017, PNC implemented an automated solution for providing such updates to
DTCC.

PNC also failed to properly report modifications to FX swap, forward, and NDF trades
(collectively, “FX trades”) during the Relevant Period. On thousands of occasions during the
Relevant Period, when PNC modified an existing FX trade, it would (1) send a cancellation
message to the SDR for the originally reported trade; (2) assign a new Unique Swap Identifier
(“USI”) number to the modified trade; (3) report the resulting new USI (or USIs) to the SDR as a
new FX trade rather than as a correction or amendment to the original trade; and (4) report the
USI of the immediately prior FX trade to the SDR in the “Prior USI” data field. PNC is in the
process of updating its FX data system to appropriately report FX trade modifications as life
cycle events rather than as new trades.

4, Failure To Timely Report Trades

PNC is required to comply with certain requirements for the real-time public reporting
and public availability of swap transaction data, including the requirement to report a publicly
reportable swap transaction to an SDR as soon as technologically practicable after the swap
transaction is executed. However, PNC failed to do so during the Relevant Period with respect
to two asset classes.

First, from October 2015 to December 2017, PNC manually reported to DTCC several
hundred commodity swaps on a T+1 basis rather than in real-time. On December 8, 2017, PNC
implemented real-time automated reporting of commodity swaps.

Second, from October 2016 to October 2017, PNC reported several hundred FX options
on a T+1 basis rather than in real-time. The reason for the delayed reporting was that, following
DTCC’s implementation of new software in October 2016, PNC continued to submit data reports
to DTCC using a “test ID” used for testing the software, DTCC rejected PNC’s reports due to the
ID being invalid, and DTCC belatedly received the trade data when it was included in the daily
snapshot PNC submitted of its entire portfolio. PNC remediated the issue on October 30, 2017,
by reconfiguring its data system to report to DTCC using the correct ID.

5, PNC’s Self-Reporting, Cooperation, and Remediation

After self-identifying that it was in violation of certain requirements related to SDR
reporting, PNC immediately initiated a broad internal review of its swaps reporting compliance.
PNC promptly disclosed to the Division the preliminary results of that review, despite not
knowing the extent of its violative conduct. Following its disclosure, PNC continued to conduct
its internal review and cooperated fully with the Division’s investigation, as well as with the
Division of Swap Dealer and Intermediary Oversight (“DSIO”) and Division of Market
Oversight (“DMO”), by voluntarily and promptly responding to the Divisions’ inquiries,
providing frequent updates on the status of its remediation work and internal review, and
disclosing additional deficiencies as PNC discovered them. PNC devoted substantial resources
to remediation of its swaps reporting violations and acted quickly to ensure forward-looking
compliance as well as to correct its issues regarding historical reports. Additionally, PNC
retained outside counsel to undertake an in-depth internal investigation and root cause analysis of
the firm’s swaps reporting deficiencies, and the conclusions reached by counsel contributed to a
reorganization of PNC’s oversight of its swaps reporting, including the termination of employees
to ensure the firm’s compliance with applicable regulations. PNC’s discovery and prompt self-
reporting of violations to the Division, its substantial cooperation with the Division’s
investigation, and its extensive remediation efforts are reflected in the substantially reduced civil
monetary penalty imposed in this Order.

HI. LEGAL DISCUSSION
A, Large Trader Reporting

Pursuant to Section 4s(f)(1)(A) of the Act: “Each registered swap dealer and major swap
participant .. . shall make such reports as are required by the Commission by rule or regulation
regarding the transactions and positions and financial condition of the registered swap dealer or
major swap participant.” 7 U.S.C. § 6s(f)(1)(A) (2012). Regulation 20.4(c) provides certain
enumerated data elements that must be included in a swap dealer’s data report. 17 C.F.R.

§ 20.4(c) (2018). These data elements include, among others: the commodity underlying the
reportable positions, commodity reference price, futures equivalent month, long paired swap
positions and short paired swap positions, swaption strike price, name of the counterparty, and
identifier indicating that a principal or counterparty position is being reported.

Large trader reporting for physical commodity swaps is essential to the Commission’s
ability to conduct effective surveillance of markets in U.S. physical commodity futures and
economically equivalent swaps. Failure to comply with the reporting specifications set forth by
the Commission hinders the Commission’s ability to efficiently process and effectively utilize
this critical data.

Regulation 20.7(a) provides, in relevant part: “Unless otherwise instructed by the
Commission, a clearing organization or reporting entity shall submit data records and any other
information required under this part to the Commission . . . [u]sing the format, coding structure,
and electronic data transmission procedures approved in writing by the Commission.” 17 C.F.R.
§ 20.7(a) (2018). The prescribed manner and form of reporting and submitting swaps data is
provided in the Part 20 Guidebook.

PNC provisionally registered as a swap dealer on January 31, 2013, and consequently
was required to submit LTRs during the Relevant Period. Between October 2015 and March
2018, PNC did not submit LTRs. Accordingly, PNC violated Section 4s(f)(1)(A) of the Act and
Regulations 20.4 and 20.7.
B. Swap Data Repository Reporting

To enhance transparency, promote standardization, and reduce systemic risk, Section 727
of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, Pub. L. No.
111-203, 124 Stat. 1376, 1696-97, added to the Commodity Exchange Act a provision that
requires all swaps, both cleared and uncleared, to be reported to a registered SDR and
establishes requirements for real-time reporting and public availability of swap transaction data.
See CEA §§ 2(a)(13)(G), 4r(a)(3), 7 U.S.C. §§ 2(a)(13)(G), 6r(a)(3) (2012). Pursuant to these
requirements, the Commission adopted implementing regulations, including under Parts 43 and
45 of the Regulations, 17 C.F.R. pts. 43, 45 (2018). The reporting requirements under those
regulations were phased-in over time based upon asset class. See Real-Time Public Reporting of
Swap Transaction Data, 77 Fed. Reg. 1182 (Jan. 9, 2012); Swap Data Recordkeeping and
Reporting Requirements, 77 Fed. Reg. 2136 (Jan. 13, 2012).

The accuracy and completeness of swap reporting are critical to the Commission’s
mission to protect market participants and to ensure market integrity. See, e.g., Inre NatWest
Markets Pie, CFTC No. 18-32, 2018 WL 4502270 (Sept. 14, 2018) (consent order); Jn re
Citibank, N.A., CFTC No. 17-26, 2017 WL 4280594 (Sept. 25, 2017) (consent order); In re
Société Générale S.A., CFTC No. 17-01, 2016 WL 7210405 (Dec. 7, 2016) (consent order); Jn re
Deutsche Bank AG, CFTC No. 15-40, 2015 WL 5783049 (Sept. 30, 2015) (consent order).
Market participants rely upon the public availability of swaps transaction and pricing data for
price discovery purposes. The Commission, in turn, requires complete and accurate swap data to
engage in meaningful oversight of the swaps market.

Part 43 establishes requirements for the real-time public reporting and public
availability of swap transaction and pricing data. See Regulations 43.2 and 43.3, 17 C.F.R.
$§ 43.2, 43.3 (2018). Under Part 43, reporting parties must “report any publicly reportable
swap transaction to a registered swap data repository as soon as technologically practicable after
such publicly reportable swap transaction is executed,” 1.e., in real time. Regulation 43.3(a)(1);
see also Regulation 43.4(a), 17 C.F.R. § 43.4(a) (2018) (‘Swap transaction and pricing
information shall be reported to a registered swap data repository so that the registered swap
data repository can publicly disseminate swap transaction and pricing data in real-time... .”).

Part 45 requires reporting parties to, among other things, report swap creation and
continuation data to ensure that all data concerning a swap remains current and accurate. See
Regulations 45.3, 45.4, 17 C.F.R. §§ 45.3, 45.4 (2018). Regulation 23.204(a), 17 C.F.R. §
23.204(a) (2018), further requires that swap dealers “shall report all information and data in
accordance with [Part 45.” Pursuant to Regulation 45.4(a), reporting parties can comply with
the continuation data requirement by “reporting life cycle event data or state data for the swap
within the applicable deadlines set forth in [Regulation 45.4].” Regulation 45.6, 17 C.F.R.

§ 45.6 (2018), requires the reporting of LEIs in all swap data reporting pursuant to Part 45, and
the definition of “life cycle event” in Regulation 45.1, 17 C.F.R. § 45.1 (2018), includes the
“availability of a legal entity identifier for a swap counterparty previously identified by name
or by some other identifier.”

At certain times during the Relevant Period, PNC failed to report all required information
and data in accordance with Part 45. Across a variety of asset classes, PNC submitted tens of
thousands of data reports that were missing required information in forty-three unique data

‘fields, in violation of Regulation 45.3. PNC failed to report continuation data properly, in
violation of Regulation 45.4, with respect to thousands of modified FX trades that PNC
incorrectly reported as having been cancelled and replaced with a new USI (thereby inflating the
apparent volume of its transactions), as well as several hundred interest rate swap trades where
PNC failed to report newly acquired LEIs for counterparties that lacked LEIs at the time of the
trade, in further violation of Regulation 45.6. Because PNC, a swap dealer, failed to comply
with these Part 45 requirements, PNC also violated Regulation 23.204(a). PNC’s practice of
manually reporting commodity swaps and its use of an erroneous user ID for FX options caused
hundreds of trades in those asset classes to be reported on a T+1 basis rather than in real time, in
violation of Regulations 43.3(a) and 43.4(a).

Cc. Liability for Acts of Agents

The foregoing acts, omissions, and failures of PNC’s employees occurred within the
scope of their employment, office, or agency with PNC; therefore, pursuant to Section 2(a)(1)(B)
of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 2(a)(1)(B) (2012), and Regulation 1.2, 17 C.F.R. § 1.2 (2018), PNC is
liable for those acts, omissions, and failures in violation of Sections 2(a)(13)(G), 4r(a)(3), and
4s(f) of the Act, and Regulations 20.4, 20.7, 23.204, 43.3, 43.4, 45.3, 45.4, and 45.6.

IV. FINDINGS OF VIOLATIONS

Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that, during the Relevant Period, PNC
violated Sections 2(a)(13)(G), 41(a)(3), and 4s(f) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. §§ 2(a)(13)(G), 6r(a)(3),
6s(f) (2012), and Regulations 20.4, 20.7, 23.204, 43.3, 43.4, 45.3, 45.4, and 45.6, 17 C.F.R.
§§ 20.4, 20.7, 23.204, 43.3, 43.4, 45.3, 45.4, 45.6 (2018).
