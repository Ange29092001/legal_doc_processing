FINAL JUDGMENT BY DEFAULT, PERMANENT INJUNCTION, CIVIL
MONETARY PENALTY, AND OTHER STATUTORY AND
EQUITABLE RELIEF AGAINST DEFENDANT BENJAMIN REYNOLDS

On June 17, 2019, Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“Commission” or
Plaintiff’) filed a Complaint charging Defendant Benjamin Reynolds (“Reynolds” or
Defendant’) with violating Section 6(c)(1) of the Commodity Exchange Act (“Act”), 7 U.S.C. §
9(1) (2018), and Commission Regulation (“Regulation”) 180.1(a), 17 C.F.R. § 180.1(a) (2020).
ECF No. 1. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(f)(3), Reynolds was properly served
with process by publication on January 18, 2020, January 25, 2020, February 1, 2020, and
February 8, 2020. ECF No. 21. Reynolds failed to appear or answer the Complaint, and the Clerk
of Court entered his default on April 6, 2020. ECF No. 28.

The Commission has moved this Court to grant final judgment by default against
Reynolds, order permanent injunctive relief, and impose a restitution obligation and a civil
monetary penalty [ECF No. 32]. The Court has carefully considered the Complaint, the

allegations of which are well-pleaded and hereby taken as true, the Commission’s memorandum

in support of its Motion [ECF No. 33], the Declarations in Support of the Motion!, and the entire
record in this case. Upon review of the filings, the Court issued an Order to Show Cause [ECF
No. 41] directing Defendant to give reasons why judgment should not be entered, directed the
Commission to serve Defendant, and held a hearing on January 27, 2021. Defendant did not
respond to the Order to Show Cause or appear at the hearing.

Based upon the foregoing, the Court makes the following findings of fact and conclusions
of law:

and Control-Pinance operated a fraudulent virtual currency scheme by soliciting customers to
deposit Bitcoin with them for the purpose of trading, falsely representing that they were earning
trading profits on behalf of their customers, and then misappropriating the Bitcoin that was
entrusted to them. Compl. FJ 1-10, 25-91.

4, Reynolds’s solicitations to potential customers included false and misleading
representations and omissions of material facts---in short, lies and deceit-—about the profitability
and safety of investing Bitcoin with Control-Finance. Compl. { 46.

5, Reynolds fraudulently induced customers to purchase Bitcoin, a virtual currency,
from third-party vendors and to thereafter transfer the Bitcom to Control-Pimance for trading in
virtual currency markets. Compl. #4 2, 25; Boulware Decl. YJ 6-7, 11-12, 17-19; Stratton Decl. YF
3-10, 20-22.

6. Reynolds operated the scheme primarily through a public website, www.control-

99%,

finance.com (the “Control-Pinance Website”), various social media accounts Gnclauding
Facebook, YouTube, and LinkedIn, among others}, and email communications, all of which he
used to promote his supposed trading methods, abilities, and profits in order to entice prospective
and existing customers to open Control-Finance accounts and deposit their Bitcoin with him.
Compl. Gf 26-61. The Control-Finance Website—through which nearly every deposit transaction
occurred—-was registered to and hosted by a web service provider in the United States. Compl ff
26, 62: Koh Decl. F 12.

7. Customers who were enticed to deposit Bitcoin with Control-Pinance were
provided a deposit confirmation webpage through the Control-Finance Website. Compl. { 41;
Koh Decl.  8(a).

S. Each deposit confirmation webpage identified the quantity of Bitcom deposited and

the value of that Bitcom im U.S. dollars. In addition, each deposit confirmation webpage

identified the purported daily “Profit” that Control-PFinance promised to pay to customers on each

deposit. Compl. © 41.

9, Reynolds solicited customers by making false and misleading claims and omissions

about the performance of Control-Fimance. Among other things, Reynolds and Control-Finance:

falsely represented on the Control-Finance Website and on Control-
Finance's social media accounts that they traded customers’ Bitcoin deposits
im virtual currency markets and employed expert virtual currency traders
who managed the deposits and generated guaranteed daily and monthly
trading profits for customers (Compl. Wy 3, 47(a)-(d); Koh Decl &(e}, 14-
22, 32-33);

falsely represented on the Control-Finance Website and on Control-
Finance's social media accounts that they took security measures to preserve
customers’ investments and practiced risk diversification and trade
allocation strategies to protect customers from volatihty (Compl. Wi] 47(e)-
(h); Roh Decl. Gf 21(d)-(e));

fabricated weekly “Trade Reports” on the Control-Finance Website to
falsely reflect virtual currency trading transactions that had not occurred and
trading profits that did not exist (Compl. Jf 4, 50-54; Koh Decl. 94 &), 28-
30; Stratton Decl. FE 17-19);

constructed an elaborate affiliate marketing network that relied on
fraudulently promising to pay outsized referral profits, rewards, and bonuses
to encourage customers to refer new customers to Control- Finance (Compl
Wy] 6-7, 34-40, 55-57; Koh Decl. 94 &(c), 24-26; Stratton Decl. 4 11-16;

Anthony Decl. (43-5):
e, created sham accounts for customers on the Control-Finance Website that

falsely reflected growing balances when in reality those accounts were
empty (Compl. (¥f 27, 41-45);
f. falsely represented on the Control-Finance Website that customers could

withdraw their profits “at any time” (Compl ¢ 41);

g. tailed to disclose that they misappropriated customers’ Bitcomn deposits
(Compl. 7 48); and
h. failed to disclose that they diverted portions of new customers’ Bitcoin
deposits to other customers in the manner of a “Ponzi” scheme (Compl. Tf
5, 45, 48, 78-81: Koh Decl. G4 S(d)-(e)).
10, These statements were false and misleading representations and omissions of

material facts. In reality, Control-Finance’s purported trading results were illusory, and Reynolds
and Control-Pinance did not trade Bitcoin on customers’ behalf, did not employ expert traders or
specialists, did not pay referral rewards or bonuses, and retained customers’ Bitcom deposits for

their own personal use. Compl. (27, 41-61; Koh Dect. W4 8(e), 23, 27, 31, 34.

il, Reynolds also offered a profit “reinvestment” option to create disincentives to
account withdrawals. Compl. @ 44; Boulware Decl. 9413, 21. By offering customers the option to
reinvest their “profits” into a program that on its surface appeared to be highly profitable,
Reynolds concealed and prolonged his fraud by convincing customers that their deposits were
rising in value, causing customers to leave their deposits in their Control-Finance accounts rather
than request withdrawals. Compl. ¥ 44.

12, Reynolds abruptly terminated operations in September 2017 by removing the
Control-Finance Website from the Internet and deleting advertising content from Control-

Finance’s social media accounts. Compl. 4 8, 82; Koh Deci. 7 35; Bouleware Decl. | 24; Anthony
Decl. € 6; Stratton Decl. { 29.
i3. In an attempt to conceal the scheme and lull customers into believing that the

shutdown was temporary, Reynolds fraudulently represented through email and Facebook that
Control-Pinance would resume operations and make all customers whole by returning their Bitcoin
deposits by late October 2017. Compl. 99/9, 33, 63-91; Bouleware Decl. (9 24-26, 28- 34; Anthony
Decl. 44 7-8; Stratton Decl. YY 30-43.

14, Reynolds instead misappropriated customers’ Bitcoin through thousands of
circuitous blockchain transactions. Compl. (£0, 90.

C. Misappropriation of Customers’ Biteoin

iS, During the Relevant Period, Reynolds and Control-Fimance uitrmately solicited and
misappropriated at least 22,190.542 Bitcoin, valued at approximately $143,000,000, from more
than 1,000 customers worldwide, including at least 169 who reside within the United States.
Compl. Wb 1,38, 25, 40, 62-69; Koh Dect. 9 $(b); Vilenskiy Deci. 4] 15, 27-30.

16. In typical transactions, customers logged into the Control-Pinance Website and
accessed the deposit webpage. The Control-Finance Website then generated 4 unique single-use
wallet address (“Single-Use Address’’) for the specific deposit. After a customer deposited Bitcoin
with the Single-Use Address, Reynolds and Control-Finance routed the deposit out of the Single-
Use Address and into one of a number of pooled wallet addresses (‘Pool Address”) under their
control, where the deposit was combined with numerous deposits by other customers. Reynolds
and Controi-Finance then transferred the Bitcoin in each Pool Address to other wallet addresses
under their control. Compl. ¥f 62-77; Vilenskiy Decl. YY 15-16, 18-26, 31-34.

17, As a result, Control-Finance’s customers have lost most if not all of their invested
funds. Compl. {4 62-77; Koh Decl. (f] &8(e), 9; Regan Decl. U4 5-7; Lewis Decl. UY 4-7; Boulware

Decl. 427; Anthony Decl. ¥ 9; Stratton Decl. (@ 28, 43.
Case 1:19-cv-05631-MKV Document 45 Filed 03/02/21 Page 7 of 18

18. In accordance with the proper measure of damages for misappropriation of assets of
fluctuating value, the Commission has valued the customer deposits at issue using Bitcoin’s
closing price on October 31, 2017—the date by which customers were promised the return of their
Bitcoin. Vilenskiy Decl. { 30; see Iglesias v. United States, 848 F.2d 362, 364 (2d Cir. 1988).”

19. Reynolds returned only $13,411.17 to customers. Boulware Decl. J 27; Stratton
Decl. Jf 27-28; Colarusso Decl. J 15. The difference between the amount Reynolds solicited and
accepted from customers ($143,000,000) and the amount he returned to customers ($13,411.17) is
$142,986,589.

I. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

A. Jurisdiction and Venue

20. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 6c(a) of the Act, 7
U.S.C. § 13a-1(a) (2018), which provides that whenever it shall appear to the Commission that a
person has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a
violations of any provision of the Act or any rule, regulation, or order thereunder, the Commission
may bring an action for injunctive relief in the proper district court of the United States against
such person to enjoin such act or practice, or to enforce compliance with the Act, or any rule,
regulation or other thereunder. This Court also has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28
U.S.C. § 1331 (2018) (federal question) and 28 U.S.C. § 1345 (2018) (United States as plaintiff).

21. With respect to personal jurisdiction, because Section 6c(e) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. §
13a-1(e) (2018), authorizes nationwide service of process with respect to requests for injunctive

relief, the United States is the “relevant forum” for the minimum contacts analysis. CFTC v. TFS-

 

* The Commission assessed the value of the Bitcoin that customers transferred to Reynolds and Control-Finance by
relying on historical pricing data that was published on the website known as CoinMarketCap,
https://coinmarketcap.com/. Vilenskiy Decl. {§[ 28-30. CoinMarketCap is a reliable valuation tool for these purposes.
See CFTC v. McDonnell, 332 F. Supp. 3d 641, 670-71 (E.D.N.Y. 2018).

ICAP, LLC, 415 F. Supp. 3d 371, 381 (S.D.NLY. 2019). The Court may exercise specific
yurisdiction over Reynolds because he committed the violations of the Act and Regulations alleged
in the Complaint within the United States, among other places. Specifically, Reynolds solicited
and collected Bitcoin from customers residing in this District and elsewhere in the United States.
Compl. (@ 6, 25; Koh Decl. ¥ 8(b); Colarusso Decl. 97.

De. In addition, the Complaint alleges that Reynolds violated the Act through use of a
website hosted and registered with an Internet hosting company located in the United States.
Reynolds used this U.S.-hosted website to make material misrepresentations to prospective and
existing customers to entice thern to open Control-Finance accounts and deposit their Bitcoin with
the company. Reynolds also used the Control-Finance U.5.-based Website to provide customers
with nominal, sham account balances and profit figures. In reality, the ihusory account balances
and profit statements that Reynolds provided to customers were not backed up by actual Bitcom,
because Reynolds had misappropriated the Bitcoin for his own use. Compl 9 26-27, 41-57, 62-
Si. The Complaint thus properly alleges a “domestic application” of the Act because the relevant,
traudulent conduct occurred on a website in the United States. Prime fnt’] Trading, Lid. v. BP
PLL.C., 937 F.3d 94, 104 (2d Cir. 2019), cert. denied sub nom. Atl. Trading USA, LLC v. BP
PLLC. 1418. Ct LIS 2020) (citing RJR Nabisco, Inc. v. European Cmty., 1365. Ct. 2090, 2100
(2016)). Further, this Court has jurisdiction because the allegations in the Complaint indicate that
the violations were extensively perpetrated through the knowing use of a website hosted in the
United States, and thus Reynolds “purposely availed” himself of the privilege of conducting
business in the United States. See MacDermid, inc. v. Deiter, 702 F.3d 725, 726-27 (2d Cir. 2012)
(although defendant committed alleged torts from Canada, she met minimal contact due process
test for jurisdiction because she “purposefully availed herself of the privilege of conducting

activities within Connecticut” by knowingly accessing her employer's Connecticut server and

email system). Reynolds has failed to appear im this case, and thus has not raised any challenges to
the Court’s purisdiction or the application of the Act to these facts.

2. Venue also properly hes with this Court pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act, 7
U.S.C. § i3a-lfe) ZOE), because Reynolds transacted business in this District through his
solicitation of customers and committed acts and practices in violations of the Act in this District.
Compl. ff 16, 25; Koh Decl. 7 8(b).

24, Service of the Complaint on Defendant was proper and was made by publication
pursuant to an Order of the Court [ECE No. 201, The Commission filed certificates of service of
the Complaint on March 3, 2020 [ECF No. 21]. When Defendant did not respond, the
Commission obtained a certificate of default against Reynolds [ECP No. 28]. The Court issued an
Order to Show Cause, directing service by publication of the motion and order to show cause [ECF
No. 41}. Reynolds failed to respond or to appear in this case.

B. Defendant Committed Fraud in Connection with Contracts of Sale of Bitcoin,

a Commodity in Interstate Commerce, in violations of Section 6(0}(1) of the Act
and Regulation 186.1fa).

2, Section 6(c)(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 91) (2018), and Commission Regulation
i8Q.i(a}, 17 CLBLR. § §60.1(a) 2020), make it unlawful for any person, in connection with
contracts of sale of any commodity in interstate commerce, including virtual currencies such as
Bitcoin, to intentionally or recklessly: (1) use or employ, or attempt to use or employ, any
manipulative device, scheme, or artifice to defraud; (2) make, or attempt to make, any untrue or
misleading staternent of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary m order to

make the statements made not untrue or misleading:

ip?

or (3) engage, or attempt to engage, in any

act, practice, or course of business, which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any
person. Virtual currencies such as Bitcoin are encompassed in the definition of “commodity” under
Section fa) of the Act, 7 ULS.C. § 1a(9} 2018). CRTC v. McDonnell, 287 F. Supp. 3d 213, 228

Big Coin Pay, inc., 334 F. Supp. 3d 492, 495-98 CD. Mass. 2018) (denial of motion to dismiss}.

26. By the conduct described above and in the Complaint, Reynolds, acting through
Control-Pinance, intentionally or recklessly, in connection with contracts of sale of a commodity in
interstate commerce, namely the virtual currency Bitcoim: (1) used or employed, or attempted to
use or employ, a manipulative device, scheme, or artifice to defraud; (2) made, or attempted to
make, untrue or misleading statements of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact
necessary in order to make the statements made not untrue or misleading; and (3) engaged, or
atternpted to engage, in an act, practice, or course of business, which operates or would operate as
a fraud or deceit upon any person, in violations of 7 U.S.C. § 9¢f) and 17 CLPLR. § 180.1 (a).

af, Through the conduct alleged, Reynolds cheated and defrauded, and attempted to
cheat and defraud, customers in connection with contracts of sale of Bitcoin, a commodity in
interstate commerce, Among other things, he falsely represented to customers that (1) he traded
their Bitcoin deposits in the virtual currency markets; (2) he employed specialized virtual currency
traders to manage customers’ deposits; (3) all Bitcoin deposited with Control-Fimance yielded
guaranteed daily and monthly profits; and (4) he practiced msk diversification and trade allocation
strategies to protect customers from volatility. He also misappropriated customer Bitcom and never
achieved the advertised results with Control-Finance customer deposits. He further concealed and
perpetuated the fraud by falsely stating that customers’ Bitcom deposits would be returned to them
by the end of October 2017.

Cc. An Injunction Is Warranted.

28. The Commission may seek permanent injunctive relief whenever a person has
violated, is violating, or is about to violate the Act. See 7 U.S.C. § I3a-Ha}. “T]he agency need

10
not prove irreparable injury or the inadequacy of other remedies as required in private injunctive
suits, but only that there is a reasonable likelihood that the wrong will be repeated. CFTC v.
British Am. Commedity Cptions Cerp., 560 F.2d 135, 141 (2d Cir. 1977) (citing SEC v. Mamet.
Dynamics, fac., 315 F.2d 801, 807-09 (2d Cir. 1975)). In determining whether there is a
“reasonable ikehthood” of future violations, courts consider the egregiousness of the defendant's
actions, the nature of the violations, the agree of scienter, the Defendant’s recognition of the
wrongfuiness of the conduct alleged, and the likelihood that Defendant’s business activities present
opportunities for future violations. SEC v. Mgmt. Dynamics, Inc., 515 F.2d 601, 807 (2d Cir.
1975). “{Vihe kelhood of future violations of law can be mterred from defendants’ past dlegal
conduct.” CRTC vy. Morgan, Harris & Scott, Lid., 484 F. Supp. 669, 677 (S.D.NLY, £979),

29, Unless restrained and enjoimed by this Court, there is a reasonable likelihood that
Reynolds will continue to engage in the acts and practices alleged in the Complaint and in similar
acts and practices in violations of the Act and Regulations. As set forth above, Defendant took
efforts to conceal his wrongdoing and mislead victims before stealing nearly all Bitcoin entrusted
to him. Given the high degree of scienter and sustained period of misconduct, as well as the extent
of Defendant's fraud and amounts stolen, a permanent injunction is warranted.

Hi. PERMANENT INJUNCTION

30, Based upon and in connection with the foregoing conduct, pursuant to Section 6c of
the Act, 7 U.S.C. § T3a-f (2018), Defendant and all persons in active concert or participation with
