ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTIONS 6(c) AND 6(d) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, MAKING
FINDINGS AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL sanctions

I.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (‘Commission’) has reason to believe that
from in or about August 2012 to at least January 2015 (the “Relevant Period”), Respondents
Sharpe Signa, LLC (“Sharpe”) and Garen Ovsepyan (“Ovsepyan”’) violated Sections
2(c)(2)(C)Gii)(1)(bb), 4b(a)(2)(A) and (C), 40(1)(A) and (B), and 6(c)(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.

§§ 2(c)(2)(C)Gn)(1)(bb), 6b(a)(2)(A) and (C), 60(1)(A) and (B), and 9(2) (2012), and
Commission Regulation (“Regulation”) 5.3(a)(3)G), 17 C.F.R. § 5.3(a)(3)q) (2014), and
Respondent Haeres Capital, LLC (“Haeres”) and Ovsepyan violated Section 6(c)(2) of the Act, 7
U.S.C. § 9(2) (2012), Therefore, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest
that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted to determine whether
Respondent(s) engaged in the violations set forth herein and to determine whether any order
should be issued imposing remedial sanctions.

Il.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Respondents have
submitted an Offer of Settlement (“Offer”), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Without admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, Respondents consent to
the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 6(c) and 6(d) of the
Commodity Exchange Act, Making Findings and Imposing Remedial sanctions (“Order”) and
acknowledge service of this Order,'

 

' Respondents consent to the entry of this Order and to the use of these findings in this

proceeding and in any other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission
is a party; provided, however, that Respondents do not consent to the use of the Offer, or the
findings or conclusions in this Order consented to in the Offer, as the sole basis for any other

 
III.
The Commission finds the following:
A. SUMMARY

Ovsepyan is the sole owner and operator of two entities, Sharpe and Haeres, that
provided advisory services to managed accounts in off-exchange foreign currency transactions
(“Forex”) during the Relevant Period, Sharpe acted as a Commodity Trading Advisor (“CTA”)
without the benefit of registration with the Commission as a CTA as required. Additionally,
Ovsepyan, on behalf of Sharpe and Haeres, filed false or misleading notices of exemption from
CTA registration and multiple affirmations of such claimed exemptions with the CFTC, knowing
that Sharpe and Haeres were not entitled to such exemptions. Sharpe, acting by and through
Ovsepyan, also created and distributed through means and instrumentalities of interstate
commerce promotional materials to current and prospective clients that were materially
misleading in at least four respects, First, Sharpe’s promotional materials listed assets under
management (“AUM7”) in amounts representing notional dollar amounts and not actual dollar
~ amounts, as a reasonable investor would expect, and this overstatement was not disclosed by
Sharpe in such promotional materials. Second, Sharpe misrepresented in promotional materials
that it used an auditing firm to calculate its advertised performance numbers; however, the
auditing firm, located in Italy, did not conduct any such audit of Sharpe. Third, Sharpe has
touted rates of return that it is unable to substantiate. Fourth, Sharpe misrepresented in due
diligence documents it provided to entities Sharpe recruited to assist in raising funds that it was
an exempt CTA, when, in fact, it did not qualify for any exemption from registration with the
CFTC,

B. RESPONDENTS

Sharpe Signa LLC is a Delaware limited liability company established in August 2012
with a purported business address in Beverly Hills, California. Sharpe has acted as a CTA by
furnishing commodity trading advice to the general public, and by holding itself out to the
general public as a CTA by offering forex advisory services in managed accounts. Sharpe
promotes itself to the public in its Disclosure Document as a boutique absolute return manager
specializing in systematic, technical and fundamental investment strategies in a global macro
fund focused on forex. Additionally, at all relevant times, Sharpe held itself out to the public as
a CTA on alternative asset manager informational websites such as activetradermag.com and
hedgepedia.com, and in industry periodicals. Sharpe has never been registered with the
Commission in any capacity.

Haeres Capital, LLC is a Delaware limited liability company established in January
2013 with the same business address in Beverly Hills, California as Sharpe. Haeres is the
purported retail arm of Sharpe and offers forex advisory services in managed accounts. Haeres

account clients reside outside the United States.

Garen Ovsepyan resides in the Glendale, California area and is the sole owner, .
principal, and managing member for both Sharpe and Haeres. Ovsepyan is responsible for all of
the key facets of Sharpe’s and Haeres’s operations, including investment strategy, compliance,
marketing and legal issues. Ovsepyan has never been registered with the Commission in any
capacity.

Cc. FACTS
1. Notice of Exemption Filings

The National Futures Association (“NFA”) is an industry self-regulatory organization
that is responsible, under CFTC oversight, for certain aspects of the regulation of futures
professionals. In 2014, during the course of an NFA review of a disclosure document for a
commodity pool operated by a registered commodity pool operator (“CPO”), NFA noted that the
CPO was using Sharpe as one of its principal CTAs to invest a portion of the pool’s assets in
forex. NFA determined that Sharpe was prohibited from providing trading advice to the pool
because Sharpe was not registered as a CTA during the Relevant Period, and the pool did not
qualify as an eligible contract participant (“ECP”), which would have obviated the need for CTA
registration,

In fact, Ovsepyan had earlier filed a CTA Notice of Exemption (“NOE”) with the CFTC
on behalf of Sharpe through the NFA’s electronic exemptions system, claiming that Sharpe was
exempt from registration as a CTA pursuant to Regulation 4.14(a)(8), 17 C.F.R. § 4.14(a)(8)
(2014). This notice, which Ovsepyan filed on August 28, 2012, was effective upon filing
pursuant to Regulation 4,14(a)(8)(iii)(C). As required under Commission Regulation
4,14(a)(8)Gii)(D), Ovsepyan filed annual notices affirming Sharpe’s NOE with the CFTC
through the NFA’s electronic exemption filing system on December 3, 2012, and again on
January 3, 2014. By filing a NOE pursuant to Rule 4.14(a)(8), Ovsepyan represented that Sharpe
was either a registered investment adviser (“RIA”) under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940,
or was exempt from such RIA registration. In the initial August 28, 2012 NOE filing, and in the
subsequent annual affirmations, Ovsepyan indicated that Sharpe was exempt from registration as
a CTA by selecting multiple qualifying reasons, namely, that Sharpe’s commodity trading advice
is directed solely to, and for the sole use of: (a) entities which are excluded from the definition
of the term “pool” or who are “qualifying entities” under Regulation 4.5, such as investment
companies, insurance companies, banks or trustees of various employee pension and welfare
plans under ERISA — for which a notice of eligibility has been filed, and (b) a CPO who has
claimed an exemption under Regulation 4.13, or if registered, treats each pool it operates that
meets the Regulation 4.13 exemption criterion as if it were not so registered. However, as
Ovsepyan knew at the time he claimed the exemption, Sharpe has never been registered as an
RIA or exempt from RIA registration, and Sharpe clearly did not qualify for any of its selected
exemptions. Following an inquiry from CFTC staff, Ovsepyan withdrew Sharpe’s exemption on
July 24, 2014.
In addition to filing an NOE on behalf of Sharpe, on April 4, 2013, Ovsepyan also filed
an NOE with the CFTC on behalf of Haeres through the NFA’s electronic exemptions system
claiming exemption pursuant to Regulation 4.14(a)(8). As required under Commission rules,
Ovsepyan filed an annual notice affirming such NOE with the CFTC through the NFA’s
electronic exemption filing system on January 3, 2014. Although Ovsepyan subsequently
withdrew Haeres exemption also on July 24, 2014, he filed another NOE with the CFTC through
the NFA’s electronic exemptions system claiming exemption pursuant to Regulation 4.14(a)(8)
on September 9, 2014, again using his NFA login and user identification to file the NOE.
Ovsepyan subsequently withdrew the exemption on January 8, 2015. By filing a NOE pursuant
to Rule 4.14(a)(8), Ovsepyan represented that Haeres was either a RIA under the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940 or was exempt from such RIA registration. In its initial April 4,2013 NOE
filing, Ovsepyan indicated that Haeres was exempt from registration as a CTA by selecting the
same multiple qualifying reasons as he had selected for Sharpe described above, plus that
Haeres’s commodity trading advice is directed solely to, and for the sole use of a commodity
pool organized and operated outside of the U.S. and all participants are non-U.S. persons.
However, as Ovsepyan knew at the time he claimed the exemption, Haeres has never been
registered as an RIA or exempt from RIA registration, and Haeres clearly did not qualify for any
of its selected supporting exemptions.

Ovsepyan knew that neither Sharpe nor Haeres was exempt from CTA registration when
he filed annual notices affirming their CTA exemptions on December 3, 2012 and January 3,
2014, but filed the exemption affirmations anyway. He also knew that Sharpe was not exempt
from CTA registration when he represented in an interview for the January-March 2014 issue of
FX Trader magazine that, “We are [sic] 4.14 Exempt CTA, meaning we can only take on certain
types of clients.” Sharpe also falsely represented that it was an exempt CTA in due diligence
documents it provided to entities Sharpe sought out to assist in raising funds.

2. Promotional Materials

Sharpe prepared promotional materials it described as “Due Diligence Questionnaires”
and “Manager Performance Analyses” stating it had as much as $145 million in AUM,” and
periodically distributed such materials to introducing brokers and prospective customers,
Additionally, for an interview that was published in the February 2013 issue of Currency Trader
magazine, Ovsepyan represented that Sharpe had $90 million in AUM, and in the April 2013
issue of Futures magazine, Ovsepyan represented that Sharpe had just under $100 million in
AUM. Finally, in January-March 2014 issue of FX Trader magazine, Ovsepyan represented
Sharpe had $140M in AUM.

However, those AUM numbers represented notional dollar amounts and not actual dollar
amounts, which was neither explained nor clarified by Sharpe in such promotional materials and
magazine articles. Ovsepyan managed less than $15 million in actual dollars.

Sharpe also represented in promotional materials that it had a relationship with DiMartino
& Associati (the “auditing firm”) dating back to 2007, to calculate its performance numbers and

 

* In the January 2014 Sharpe Signa “Manager Performance Analysis” Ovsepyan represented Sharpe had $145M in
AUM.

 
that it had achieved stellar annualized rates of return (as much as 61.5%) through forex trading.
However, the auditing firm never conducted an audit of Sharpe. Sharpe also made misleading
forward looking statements representing in certain promotional materials that Sharpe was going
to hire KPMG/Rothstein Kass (“KPMG”) for the year end 2013 audit, which it did not ever do.
In addition, Ovsepyan sent written communications via conventional and/or electronic mail
containing misrepresentations and omissions of material facts to Sharpe’s clients and prospective
clients regarding Sharpe’s: (a) AUM and its actual and notional funding levels, and

(b) published and audited rates of return.

IV.
LEGAL DISCUSSION
A, Sharpe Failed to Register as a CTA

Section 2(c)(2)(C)(iii)(T)(bb) of the Act bars persons not registered with the CFTC from
exercising discretionary trading authority over any account for or on behalf of any person that is
not an ECP in connection with off-exchange Forex transactions.

Specifically, Section 2(c)(2)(C)(ii)(D(bb) of the Act states that a person, unless
registered in such capacity as the Commission by rule, regulation, or order,.., shall not —
(bb) exercise discretionary trading authority or obtain written authorization to exercise written
trading authority over any account for or on behalf of any person that is not an ECP in
connection with agreements, contracts, or transactions described in clause (i)° of this
subparagraph entered into with or to be entered into with a person who is not described in item
(aa), (bb), (dd), (ee), or (ff) of subparagraph (B)(i)(ID).* Regulation 5.3(a)(3)(i), 17 C.F.R.
§ 5.3(a)(3)G) (2014), requires any CTA who exercises discretionary trading authority or obtains
written authorization to exercise written trading authority over any account for or on behalf of
any person that is not an ECP in connection with retail forex transactions, to register with the
Commission,

During the Relevant Period, one of Sharpe’s CTA clients (a U.S.-based commodity pool)
did not qualify as an ECP under either Section 1a(18) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § la(18) (2012), or
Commission Regulation 1.3(m)(8), 17 C.F.R. § 1.3(m)(8) (2014). Accordingly, in connection
with its CTA business, Sharpe was prohibited from providing trading advice to the commodity
pool because Sharpe was not registered as a CTA.

 

; Leveraged forex transaction conducted with non-ECPs at a retail foreign exchange dealer

(“RFED”) or futures commission merchant (“FCM”) that do not result in actual delivery within 2
days or create an enforceable obligation to deliver between a seller and buyer that have the
ability to deliver and accept delivery, respectively, in connection with their line of business.

| Financial institutions, brokers and dealers registered under the Securities Exchange Act

of 1934 and associated persons thereof, futures commission merchants and affiliated persons
thereof, financial holding companies, and RFEDs registered with the Commission, Note that
under Dodd-Frank, subparagraph (B)(i)(I]) is amended, however, even as amended it does not
contain exceptions relevant to Sharpe and Ovsepyan.

 
Sharpe violated Section 2(c)(2)(C)Gi1)()(bb), 7 U.S.C. § 2(c)(2)(C) Git) C)(bb) (2012),
and Regulation 5.3(a)(3)(), 17 C.F.R. § 5.3(a)(3)G@) (2014), in that it acted as a CTA without the
benefit of registration with the Commission as a CTA.

B, Ovsepyan Made a False or Misleading Statement to the Commission

Section 6(c)(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 9(2) (2012), in relevant part, provides that it is
unlawful “...for any person to make any false or misleading statement of a material fact to the
Commission, including in any registration application or any report filed with the Commission
under this Act,.,.or to omit to state in any such statement any material fact that 1s necessary to
make any statement of a material fact made not misleading in any material respect, if the person
knew or reasonably should have known, the statement to be false or misleading.” (emphasis

added),

During the Relevant Period, Ovsepyan filed a false or misleading NOE with the CFTC on
behalf of Sharpe on August 28, 2012, in violations of Section 6(c)(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 9(2)
(2012). Ovsepyan affirmed such false or misleading NOE with the CFTC on December 3, 2012,
and again on January 3, 2014. At all relevant times, Ovsepyan knew or reasonably should have
known that Sharpe did not qualify for such CTA exemption because Sharpe clearly did not meet
any of the exemption criteria as represented in the NOE filing.

Additionally, during the Relevant Period, Ovsepyan filed a false or misleading NOE with
the CFTC on behalf of Haeres on April 4, 2013 in violations of Section 6(c)(2) of the Act,
7 U.S.C, § 9(2) (2012). Ovsepyan affirmed such false or misleading NOE with the CFTC on
January 3, 2014. Subsequently, Ovsepyan filed a second false or misleading NOE with the
CFTC on behalf of Haeres on September 9, 2014. At all relevant times, Ovsepyan knew or
reasonably should have known that Haeres did not qualify for such CTA exemption because
Haeres clearly did not meet any of the exemption criteria as represented in both NOE filings. By
this conduct, Ovsepyan violated Section 6(c)(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 9(2) (2012). See
generally, Inre Sean R. Stropp, CFTC Docket No. 14-09, 2014 WL 1117260 (CFTC March 18,
2014) (consent order finding violations of Section 6(c)(2) for falsifying a financial disclosure
statement provided to the CFTC in connection with an investigation into potentially unlawful
off-exchange precious metals contracts); In re Artem Obolensky, CFTC Docket No. 14-05

A, Beatty, CFTC Docket No. 14-34, 2014 WL 4965119 (CFTC Sept. 30, 2014) (consent order

to an investigative subpoena); and CFTC vy. Arista et al., 2013 WL 6978529 (S.D.N.Y.
December 3, 2013) (consent order finding Defendants liable for violating Section 6(c)(2)
because they misrepresented certain account balances, asset values, and fee calculations in a
letter sent in response to requests for information from the CFTC’s Division of Enforcement).

 
Cc, Ovsepyan Made Material Misrepresentations and Omissions Regarding Sharpe, in
violations of Section 4b(a) of the Act

Section 4b(a)(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 4b(a)(2)(A) (2012), makes it unlawful for any
person: (A) to cheat or defraud or attempt to cheat or defraud another person; or (C) willfully to
deceive or attempt to deceive another person by any means whatsoever in connection with
certain off-exchange commodity contracts. Ovsepyan violated Section 4b(a)(2)(A) and (C) of
the Act, in connection with Forex trading, by making misrepresentations and omitting material
facts in the marketing of Sharpe and solicitation of participants in connection with Sharpe’s CTA
business.

To establish liability for fraud based on misrepresentations and omissions under Section
4b(a) of the Act, the Commission must prove that: (a) a misrepresentation, misleading statement,
or omission was made; (b) with scienter; and (c) that the misrepresentation, statement or
omission was material, CFTC v. R.J. Fitzgerald & Co., Inc., 310 F.3d 1321, 1328 (11th Cir,
2002), cert. denied, 543 U.S. 1034 (2004). See also In re Slusser, [1998-1999 Transfer Binder]
Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) ¢ 27,701, 1999 CFTC LEXIS 167, at *27 (CFTC July 19, 1999)
(same),

1. Ovsepyan Made Material Misrepresentations and Failed to Disclose
Material Facts

“Whether a misrepresentation has been made depends on the ‘overall message’ and the
‘common understanding of the information conveyed.’” RJ. Fitzgerald, 310 F.3d at 1328 (citing
Hammond y. Smith Barney Harris Upham & Co., [1987-1990 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L.
Rep. (CCH) 24,617 at 36,657 & n.12 (CFTC Mar. 1, 1990)). Ovsepyan stated in promotional
materials and in trade magazine interviews that Sharpe was managing as much as $145M in
AUM, but later admitted that Sharpe managed approximately $15 million or less in actual funds.
Additionally, Ovsepyan could not produce any documents to substantiate either Sharpe’s actual
or notional AUM figures. Ovsepyan further failed to clarify and distinguish between the
meaning of actual and notional funding levels when representing Sharpe’s current AUM in
promotional materials, thus providing a false sense of security and added industry credibility by
appearing to manage such a large portfolio of accounts. Further, Ovsepyan failed to disclose to
Sharpe’s clients and prospective clients that Sharpe did not use an auditing firm to calculate
some of its published monthly and annual rates of return contained in Sharpe’s promotional
materials. Similar to its AUM representations, Ovsepyan also could not produce documents to
substantiate Sharpe’s audited rates of return. Finally, Ovsepyan represented in due diligence
documents he provided to entities Sharpe sought out to assist in raising funds that Sharpe was in
fact an exempt CTA, which was false.

2. Ovsepyan Acted With Scienter

Scienter is established when a person’s acts are performed “with knowledge of their
nature and character.” Wasnick v. Refco, Inc., 911 F.2d. 345, 348 (9th Cir, 1990) (internal
quotation marks and citation omitted), The Commission need not prove evil motive or intent to
injure a client, or that Respondents wanted to cheat or defraud their customers. Cange v. Stotler
& Co. Inc., 826 F.2d 581, 589 (7th Cir. 1987). Instead, the Commission must demonstrate that a

 
defendant committed the alleged wrongful acts “intentionally or with reckless disregard for his
duties under the Act.” Drexel Burnham Lambert, Inc. vy, CFTC, 850 F.2d 742, 748 (D.C. Cir.
1988) (finding that recklessness is sufficient to satisfy scienter requirement). See also McCarthy
v. Paine Webber, Inc., 618 F. Supp. 933, 940 (N.D. II, 1985), To prove that conduct is
intentional, the Commission need only show that a defendant’s actions were “intentional as
opposed to accidental.” Lawrence vy, CFTC, 759 F, 2d 767, 773 (9th Cir. 1985). To prove that
conduct is reckless, the Commission must show that it “departs so far from the standards of
ordinary care that it is very difficult to believe the [actor] was not aware of what he was doing.”
Drexel Burnham Lambert, 850 F.2d at 748 (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks and
citation omitted), See also McCarthy, 618 F. Supp. at 940 (holding that recklessness is sufficient
to satisfy the scienter requirement).

Here, Ovsepyan made material misrepresentations or omissions of material fact with the
requisite scienter in connection with Sharpe’s CTA business. Among other things, Ovsepyan
knew or recklessly disregarded the facts that: (a) he failed to disclose that Sharpe was, in fact,
only managing approximately $15 million in actual funds, but stated in promotional materials
and in trade magazine interviews that Sharpe was managing as much as $145M in AUM,

(b) Ovsepyan failed to clarify and distinguish between the meaning of actual and notional
funding levels when representing Sharpe’s current AUM in promotional materials, thus
providing a false sense of added industry credibility and security by appearing to manage such a
large portfolio of accounts, (c) Ovsepyan led Sharpe’s clients and prospective clients to believe
that Sharpe used an auditing firm to calculate some of its published monthly and annual rates of
return contained in Sharpe’s promotional materials, and (d) Ovsepyan misrepresented in due
diligence documents Sharpe provided to entities it sought out to assist in raising funds that it was
an exempt CTA, Ovsepyan further could not produce documents sufficient to substantiate either
Sharpe’s AUM figures, or its audited rates of return, Thus, Ovsepyan acted with the requisite
scienter.

3. Ovsepyan’s Misrepresentations Were Material

A statement is material if “it is substantially likely that a reasonable person would
consider the matter important in making an investment decision.” CFTC v, Noble Wealth Data
Information Servs, Inc., 90 F. Supp. 2d 676, 686 (D. Md, 2000) (quoting Sudol v. Shearson Loeb
Rhoades, Inc., [1984-1986 Transfer Binder} Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) 9 22,748 at 31,119
(CFTC Sept. 30, 1985) (citing TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., 426 U.S. 438, 449 (1976)).
Any fact that enables customers to assess independently the risk inherent in their investment and
the likelihood of profit is a material fact. In re Commodities Int'l Corp., [1996-1998 Transfer
Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) 4 26,943 at 44,563-64 (CFTC Jan. 14, 1997).
Misrepresentations regarding profit potential and risk “go to the heart of a customer’s investment
decision and are therefore material as a matter of law.” Noble Wealth, 90 F. Supp. 2d at 686
(citing CFTC v. Commonwealth Fin. Group, 874 F. Supp. 1345, 1353-54 (S.D. Fla. 1994)),

Ovsepyan’s misrepresentations and omissions regarding AUM and the difference
between actual and notional funding levels, Sharpe’s audited rates of return, and its registration
status, were all material to a reasonable investor’s decision whether to trade Forex through
Sharpe and violated Section 4b(a)(2)(A) and (C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 6b(a)(2)(A) and (C).

 
D. Sharpe Violated Sections 40(1) of the Act by its Misrepresentations and Omissions

Section 40(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 60(1) (2012), in relevant part, makes it unlawful for
CTAs, CPOs, and their associated persons (“AP”), by use of the mails or any means or
instrumentality of interstate commerce, directly or indirectly, (A) to employ any device, scheme,
or artifice to defraud any participant; or (B) to engage in any transaction, practice, or course of
business that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any participant. Section 40(1) of the Act
“broadly prohibits fraudulent conduct” and applies to all CTAs, CPOs, and their APs, whether
registered, required to be registered, or exempted from registration.” CFTC ex rel. Kelley v.
Skorupskas, 605 F. Supp. 923, 932 (E.D. Mich. 1985). See also Regulation 4,15, 17 C.F.R.
§ 4.15 (2014). Section 40(1) of the Act became applicable to Forex CTAs as of October 18,
2010. The same fraudulent conduct that violates Section 4b of the Act also violates Section
40(1) of the Act. Skorupskas, 605 F. Supp. at 932-33; In re R&W Technical Servs. Ltd., [1998-
1999 Transfer Binder] Comm, Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) § 27,582, 1999 CFTC LEXIS 50, at *80
(CFTC Mar. 16, 1999), aff'd in part R&W Technical Serv. Ltd. vy. CFTC, 205 F.3d 165 (Sth Cir.
2000),

Sharpe used the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce while
acting as a CTA to employ a device, scheme or artifice to defraud its clients, and engaged in a
transaction, practice or course of business which operated as a fraud upon its clients, by, among
other things: emailing or sending written communications containing fraudulent
misrepresentations and omissions of material facts to Sharpe clients and prospective clients, in
violations of Section 40(1)(A) and (B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. §§ 60(1 (A) and (B). Because
Ovsepyan’s and Sharpe’s fraudulent conduct violates Section 4b of the Act, by those same acts,
Sharpe violated Section 40(1)(A) and (B) of the Act. Jn re Slusser, [1998-1999 Transfer Binder]
Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) § 27,701 at 48,315 (CFTC July 19, 1999) (“Where the record
establishes that the respondents engaged in fraudulent conduct in violations of section 4b the
Division has ... surpassed its burden of proof with respect to section 40.”).

E. Derivative Liability
1. Controlling Person Liability for Ovsepyan.

Ovsepyan controlled Sharpe and Haeres and, as a controlling person, is liable for
Sharpe’s and Haeres’s violations of the Act pursuant to Section 13(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
§ 13c(b) (2012). Pursuant to Section 13(b) of the Act:.

Any person who, directly or indirectly, controls any person who has violated any
provision of this Act or any of the rules, regulations, or orders issued pursuant to
this Act may be held liable for such violations in any action brought by the
Commission to the same extent as such controlled person. In such action, the
Commission has the burden of proving that the controlling person did not act in
good faith or knowingly induced, directly or indirectly, the act or acts constituting
the violations.

A “fundamental purpose” of the statute is “to reach behind the corporate entity to the
controlling individuals of the corporation and to impose liability for violations of the Act directly

 
on such individuals as well as on the corporation itself.” RJ. Fitzgerald, 310 F.3d at 1334
(quoting JCC, Inc. v. CFTC, 63 F.3d 1557, 1567 (11th Cir. 1995) (internal quotation marks and
citation omitted)). To establish controlling person liability under Section 13(b) of the Act, the
Commission must show: (1) control; and (2) lack of good faith or knowing inducement of the
acts constituting the violations. /n re First Nat’l Trading Corp., [1992-1994 Transfer Binder]
Comm, Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) § 26,142, at 41,787 (CFTC July 20, 1994), aff'd without opinion sub
nom. Pick vy. CFTC, 99 F.3d 1139 (6th Cir, 1996),

To establish the requisite control, the Commission must show that a defendant possessed
general control over the operation of the entity principally liable. See, e.g., RU. Fitzgerald, 310
F.3d at 1334 (recognizing an individual who “exercised the ultimate choice-making power
within the firm regarding its business decisions” as a controlling person). Evidence that a
defendant is an officer, founder, principal, or the authorized signatory on the company’s bank
accounts indicates the power to control a company. Jn re Spiegel, [1987-1990 Transfer Binder]
Comm, Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) { 24,103, at 34,767 (CFTC Jan. 12, 1988); see also Apache Trading
Corp., [1990-1992 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) ¥ 25,251, at 38,795 (CFTC
Mar, 11, 1992) (finding that an individual who “maintained control over the economic aspects of
the operations” of a firm was a controlling person of it).

Ovsepyan is Sharpe’s and Haeres’s sole owner, managing member and sole principal. He
manages all of the day-to-day operations of Sharpe and Haeres and is responsible for Sharpe’s
and Haeres’s investment strategy, compliance, legal, banking activity, trading, promotional, and
operational issues. Ovsepyan also oversees the Sharpe Risk Committee that is in charge of all
supervision and accountability of risk management.

To establish “knowing inducement” of the acts constituting the violations, the
Commission must show that “the controlling person had actual or constructive knowledge of the
core activities that constitute the violations at issue and allowed them to continue.” JCC, Inc., 63
F.3d at 1568 (quoting /n re Spiegel, [1987-1990 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH)

q 24,103, at 34,767 (CFTC Jan. 12, 1988)). Controlling persons cannot avoid liability by
deliberately or recklessly avoiding knowledge about potential wrongdoing. Jn re Spiegel,
4 24,103, at 34,767.

Ovsepyan knew that Sharpe and Haeres were not registered as CTAs and also knew at the
time that he filed the NOEs on behalf of Sharpe and Haeres, as well as with their respective
affirmations, that both Sharpe and Haeres did not qualify for CTA registration exemptions
because neither Sharpe, nor Haeres were RIAs and could not individually or collectively meet
any of the underlying qualifying registration exemptions. Additionally, Ovsepyan knowingly
emailed or sent written communications containing fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions
of material facts to Sharpe’s customers and prospective customers regarding Sharpe’s: (a) AUM
and its actual and notional funding levels, (b) purported audited rates of return, and (c) current
registration status with the Commission.

Therefore, Ovsepyan did not act in good faith and knowingly induced, directly or

indirectly, the acts constituting Sharpe’s and Haeres’s violations alleged here. Ovsepyan is
therefore liable for Sharpe’s violations of Sections 2(c)(2)(C)aii)(D (bb), 4b(a)(2)(A) and (C),

10

 
4o0(1)(A) and (B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. §§ 2(c)(2)(C) (iii) (bb), 6b(a)(2)(A) and (C), 60(1)(A) and
(B) 2012), and Regulation 5.3(a)(3)(i), 17 C.F.R. § 5.3(a)(3)G) (2014), to the same extent as
Sharpe and Haeres, as a controlling person pursuant to Section 13(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.

§ 13¢(b) (2012),

2. Sharpe’s and Haeres’s Agency/Principal Liability

Under Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 2(a)(1)(B) (2012), and Regulation 1.2,
17 C.ELR. § 1.2 (2014), strict liability is imposed upon principals for the actions of their agents
acting within the scope of their employment.” Rosenthal & Co. vy. CFTC, 802 F.2d 963, 966 (7th
Cir. 1986) (principals are strictly liable for the acts of their agents), Dohmen-Ramirez v. CFTC,
837 F.2d 847, 857-58 (9th Cir. 1988). Ovsepyan’s actions were committed within the scope of
his employment with and operation of both Sharpe and Haeres. Thus, Sharpe and Haeres are
liable for Ovsepyan’s individual acts constituting violations of Section 6(c)(2) of the Act,
7 ULS.C. § 9(2) (2012), as his principal, pursuant to Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
§ 2(a)(1)(B), and Regulation 1.2, 17 C.F.R. § 1.2 (2014).

Vv,

and 6(c)(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. §§ 2(c)(2)(C)Gii)(1)(bb), 6b(a)(2)(A) and (C), 60(1)(A) and (B),

and 9(2) (2012), and Regulation 5,.3(a)(3)(@), 17 C.F.R. § 5.3(a)(3)(1) (2014), and Haeres and
