ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTION 6(c) AND (d) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT,
MAKING FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

I, INTRODUCTION

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“Commission”) has reason to believe that
from December 31, 2012, until at least 2018 (the “Relevant Period”), The Bank of New York
Mellon (“BNYM,” “Respondent,” or the ‘““Bank”) violated Sections 2(a)(13)(G) and 4r(a)(3) of
the Commodity Exchange Act (the “Act’), 7 U.S.C. §§ 2(a)(13)(G), 6r(a)(3) (2012), and
Regulations 43.3 and 45.3, 17 C.F.R. §§ 43.3, 45.3 (2019), of the Commission’s Regulations
(“Regulations”) promulgated thereunder. Therefore, the Commission deems it appropriate and
in the public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted to
determine whether Respondent engaged in the violations set forth herein and to determine
whether any order should be issued imposing remedial sanctions.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Respondent has
submitted an Offer of Settlement (“Offer”), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Without admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, Respondent consents to
the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Section 6(c) and (d) of the Act,
Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (“Order”), and acknowledges service of this
Order.

 

Respondent consents to the use of the findings of fact and conclusions of law in this Order in this proceeding and
in any other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party or claimant, and agrees
that they shall be taken as true and correct and given preclusive effect therein, without further proof. Respondent
does not consent, however, to the use of this Order, or the findings or conclusions herein, as the sole basis for any
other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission ts a party or claimant, other than: a
proceeding in bankruptcy or receivership; or a proceeding to enforce the terms of this Order. Respondent does not
consent to the use of the Offer or this Order, or the findings or conclusions in this Order, by any other party in any
other proceeding.
Il. FINDINGS

The Commission finds the following:

A. SUMMARY

Over a period of more than five years, from December 31, 2012, through at least 2018,
BNYM failed to correctly report hundreds of thousands of swap transactions to an SDR as
required by the Act and the Regulations. This conduct violated Sections 2(a)(13)(G) and 4r(a)(3)
of the Act, 7 U.S.C. §§ 2(a)(13)(G), 6r(a)(3) (2012), and Regulations 43.3 and 45.3, 17 C.F.R.

§§ 43.3, 45.3 (2019).

In accepting Respondent’s Offer of Settlement, the Commission recognizes BNYM’s
substantial cooperation during the Division of Enforcement’s (“Division”) investigation of this
matter. The Commission notes that BNYM’s cooperation and remediation are recognized in the
form of a substantially reduced civil monetary penalty.

B. RESPONDENT

The Bank of New York Mellon (““BNYM”) is the world’s largest custody bank and asset
servicing company. BNYM became a provisionally registered swap dealer on December 31,
2012. Its swap dealer activity is centered in its Markets Group which offers products including |
Spot Foreign Exchange (“FX”), Deliverable FX Swaps and Forwards, and Interest Rate Swaps.

C. FACTS

1. FX Swap Reporting Violations

From December 31, 2012, through July 2, 2018, BNYM failed to correctly report tens of
thousands of FX swaps. FX swaps do not have a unique product identifier so each leg of the FX
swap needs to be reported to the SDR along with an identifier linking the legs. During this
period, BNYM did not correctly report approximately one-third of its FX swaps. For some of
these incorrectly reported FX swaps, BNYM reported only one leg of the swap. For others,
BNYM reported both legs of the swap transaction, but failed to include the identifier indicating
that these two legs were in fact a single swap transaction. Both types of errors had the effect of
making it impossible for a person contemporaneously reviewing BNYM’s reports to determine
that BNYM had, in fact, entered into these 184,000 FX swap transactions.

2. Interaffiliate Swap Reporting Violations

From early 2013 through March 2016, nine BNYM affiliates were incorrectly classified
as intrabank accounts rather than separate legal entities. As a result, tens of thousands of
transactions with these nine affiliates that should have been reported to an SDR were not
reported.
3. Swap Reporting Violations Involving Bunched Trades

Throughout the Relevant Period, BNYM has entered into FX transactions with
investment managers acting as agents for one or more principals (“Bunched Trades”). After a
Bunched Trade was executed, the investment manager provided BNYM with the names of the
customers to which portions of the Bunched Trades were to be booked and the size of each such
portion (“Allocated Trades”). Since December 31, 2012, through at least December 31, 2018,
BNYM has been reporting these Allocated Trades but failing to report the underlying Bunched
Trades. During the Relevant Period, thousands of Bunched Trades that should have been
reported to an SDR were not reported.

4, BNYM’s Cooperation

Throughout the Division’s investigation, BNYM provided substantial cooperation.
Among other things, BNYM conducted an internal investigation and provided specific and
detailed information to the Division regarding the reporting deficiencies its internal investigation
revealed. BNYM continued to substantially cooperate with the Division in its effort to confirm
the results of the internal investigation. In addition, BNYM has taken substantial steps to
remediate these deficiencies and improve its processes for swap reporting going forward.

Il. LEGAL DISCUSSION

A. BNYM?’s Conduct Violated Sections 2(a)(13)(G) and 4r(a)(3) of the Act,
7 U.S.C, 8§ 2(a)(13)(G), 6r(a)(3) (2012), and Regulations 43.3 and 45.3,
17 C.F.R. 8§ 43.3, 45.3 (2019)

Sections 2(a)(13)(G) and 4r(a)(3) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. §§ 2(a)(13)(G), 6r(a)(3) (2012),
require that swaps be reported to an SDR and establishes requirements for such reporting. This
section of the Act and the Commission’s implementing regulations in Parts 43 and 45 of the
Regulations, 17 C.F.R. pts. 43, 45 (2019), were designed to enhance transparency, promote
standardization, and reduce systemic risk. The accuracy and completeness of swap reporting are
critical to the Commission’s mission to protect market participants and to ensure market
integrity. See, e.g., Inre Ice Futures U.S., CFTC No. 15-17, 2015 WL 1276463 (Mar. 16, 2015)
(consent order); In re Deutsche Bank Sec. Inc., CFTC No. 15-11, 2015 WL 1508451 (Dec. 22,
2014) (consent order).

Among the requirements of the Act and Regulations related to swap reporting, Part 43
establishes requirements for the real-time reporting and public availability of swap transaction
data. See Regulations 43.2 and 43.3, 17 C.F.R. §§ 43.2, 43.3 (2019). Under Part 43, reporting
parties must report a publicly-reportable swap transaction to an SDR as soon as technologically
practicable after the swap transaction is executed. See Regulation 43.3.

Part 45 of the Regulations requires reporting parties to, among other things, report swap
creation data to an SDR. Regulation 45.3, 17 C.F.R. § 45.3 (2019), sets forth the requirements
for reporting creation data, including primary economic terms data and confirmation data. See
Regulation 45.3(b) and 45.3(c).
From December 31, 2012, through 2018, on thousands of occasions, BNYM failed to
report swap transactions to an SDR consistent with the requirements of Sections 2(a)(13)(G) and
4r(a)(3) of the Act and Regulations 43.3 and 45.3. Accordingly, BNYM violated these
provisions of the Act and the Regulations.

B. BNYM’s Liability for the Acts of Its Employees

Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 2(a)(1)(B) (2012), and Regulation 1.2, 17

C.F.R. § 1.2 (2019), provide that the act, omission, or failure of any official, agent, or other
person acting for any individual, association, partnership, corporation, or trust within the scope
of his employment or office shall be deemed the act, omission, or failure of such individual,
association, partnership, corporation, or trust. Pursuant to Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act and
Regulation 1.2, strict liability is imposed on principals for the actions of their agents. See, e.g.,
Dohmen-Ramirez & Wellington Advisory, Inc. v. CFTC, 837 F.2d 847, 857-58 (9th Cir. 1988);
Rosenthal & Co. v. CFTC, 802 F.2d 963, 966 (7th Cir. 1986).

The foregoing acts, omissions, and failures of BNYM’s employees occurred within the
scope of their employment, office, or agency with BNYM; therefore, pursuant to Section
2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, and Regulation 1.2, BNYM is liable for those acts, omissions, and failures
in violation of the Act and Regulations.

IV. FINDINGS OF VIOLATIONS

2(a)(13)(G) and 4r(a)(3) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 2(a)(13)(G), 6r(a)(3) (2012), and Regulations
43,3 and 45.3, 17 C.F.R. § 43.3, 45.3 (2019).
