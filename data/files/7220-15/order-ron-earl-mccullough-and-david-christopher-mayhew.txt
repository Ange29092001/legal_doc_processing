Defendants.

This matter is before the court on Plaintiff U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission’s (“CFTC”) Motion for Default Judgment [DE-26]. For the reasons stated below,
the motion is ALLOWED.

L PROCEDURAL HISTORY AND FINDINGS OF FACT"

This action arises out of fraudulent trading activity that Defendants David Christopher
Mayhew (“Mayhew”) and Ron Earl McCullough (“McCullough”) participated in both
individually and collectively. Between December 2008 and January 2012, the defendants
fraudulently solicited approximately 2.3 million dollars from at least eleven members of the
public. McCullough and Mayhew also used Travis Cox to both solicit funds from investors and
further their fraud. They represented to Cox that they were millionaires and that they had made

their money through foreign exchange, or “forex” trading. McCullough and Mayhew made

 

' These facts are taken from the Complaint and the Declarations regarding the Motion for Default
Judgment [DE-26] and the documents in support of the Plaintiff's Memorandum in Support of Motion for
Default Judgment [DE-27]. See Declarations [DE-28, -29, -30]; Exhibits [DE-34, -35, -36].

Travis Cox a “partner” whereby they simultaneously defrauded him and used his trust in them to
further their fraud against other victims.

The defendants’ basic scheme worked in the following manner: the “trader”
(McCullough, Mayhew, or Travis Cox) would approach a potential investor to solicit trade
money; they would entice potential investors by falsely promising high returns, falsely
guaranteeing the security of the investors’ principle, and misrepresenting the risks of trading.
Once the defendants had the money, they would either use the funds for personal use or use the
funds to repay other investors, thereby creating the appearance of a successful trade and
furthering the fraud. By doing this, the defendants were able to get at least two customers to
reinvest with them. Over the course of the fraud, the defendants received approximately $2.03
million dollars from customers. The defendants lost $394,000 trading in Forex, misappropriated
$808,000 to repay investors, created the false appearance of profits, and misappropriated
$829,000 for personal use.

CFTC filed an Affidavit of Service of Summons and Complaint [DE-5] on February 24,
2014. Mayhew was personally served in this matter. Pl.’s Mem. Supp. Mot. Default J. [DE-27] at
1. McCullough is currently a fugitive, avoiding pending criminal charges in the same matter. Jd.
at 2. CFTC sought permission of the court for service by publication. See Plaintiffs Motion for
an Order Authorizing Service by Publication and Extending Time for Service [DE-13]. The court
granted CFTC’s motion for service by publication as to McCullough on September 2, 2014. See
Order of September 2, 2014 [DE-18]. On the same date, this court granted CFTC’s motion for
default against Mayhew. See id. After McCullough was served by publication, the Clerk of Court

entered default judgment against him. See Clerk’s Entry of Default [DE-25}. Because both

2

Case 5:14-cv-00083-F Document 37 Filed 08/14/15 Page 2 of 11
 

defendants have not responded throughout the course of this litigation, CFTC now seeks entry of
default judgment.
Il. DISCUSSION
A. Entry of default judgment

Entry of default judgment is authorized by Rule 55 when a defendant “has failed to plead
or otherwise defend” a suit in accordance with the Rules. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(a). When a
defendant is in default, all of the well-pleaded factual allegations of the complaint are deemed
admitted. Ryan v. Homecomings Fin. Network, 253 F.3d 778, 780 (4th Cir. 2001). Having
accepted the well-pleaded allegations of fact in the Complaint as true, the court must still
determine whether those allegations support the relief sought. /d.

i. Defendant Mayhew

The case of default against defendant Mayhew is straightforward. Rule 55 allows entry of
default when a defendant fails to plead or otherwise defend a lawsuit. Mayhew was personally
served on February 24, 2014, but has made no attempt to respond to this action. See Aff. [DE-5].
Default has been entered against him. See Entry of Default [DE-19]. He continues to show no
interest in defending the suit, even though he has had some sixteen months to respond, during
which time he was tried and found guilty of multiple accounts relating to the fraud underling this
case. See Jury Verdict [DE-145], United States v. Mayhew, No. 5:13-CR-199-F-2. A court can
enter default judgment after a defendant has received adequate notice of the action and still fails
to make an effort to defend the suit. See Boddie v. Connecticut, 401 U.S. 371, 378 (1971) (citing
Windsor v. McVeigh, 93 U.S. 274, 278 (1876)). This court is satisfied that personal service, and

over sixteen months’ time to respond, is adequate opportunity for Mayhew to defend this suit.

3
Case 5:14-cv-00083-F Document 37 Filed 08/14/15 Page 3 of 11
 

 

this suit. The court concludes that the procedural requirements for entry of default judgment have
been met as to Mayhew.

ii. Defendant McCullough

In the case of persons who are missing, employment of likely futile means of service,
such as service by publication, are often all the plaintiff can achieve. Mullane v. Central Hanover
Bank & Tr. Co., 339 U.S. 306, 317 (1950). In those circumstances, service by publication does
not create a “constitutional bar to a final decree foreclosing [the missing defendant’s] rights.” Jd.

Defendant McCullough is currently a fugitive. CFTC attempted to serve process on
McCullough at his last known Raleigh address, and at two addresses in Georgia where there was
reason to believe McCullough might be residing. See Summons in a Civil Action [DE-4];
Declaration of Plaintiffs Investigator in Support of Motion for an Order Authorizing Service by
Publication and Extending Time for Service [DE-14-1] {§ 2-5, 7. None of these attempts were
successful. CFTC further attempted to serve McCullough through four email addresses
associated with him. See Decl. Pl.’s Investigator [DE-14-1] ] 8. CFTC received no response. The
court then granted CFTC permission to serve McCullough by publication, which CFTC carried
out. See Order of September 2, 2014 [DE-18]. CFTC again received no response. See Affidavit
of Plaintiff's Counsel in Support of Motion Requesting Entry of Default of Defendant Ron Earl
McCullough [DE-22]. Default has been entered against McCullough. Clerk’s Entry of Default
[DE-25]. The court concludes that the procedural requirements for entry of default judgment
have been met as to McCullough
B. Remedies

Simply because the defendants are in default does not automatically mean the plaintiffs are

entitled to their requested relief. Rather, having accepted the well-pleaded allegations of fact in

4
Case 5:14-cv-00083-F Document 37 Filed 08/14/15 Page 4 of 11
 

 

the Complaint as true, the court must still determine whether those allegations support the relief
sought. Ryan, 253 F.3d at 780. All of CFTC’s requested relief is authorized under the statute that
the defendants have violated. See 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1. All of the sums requested are supported by
detailed affidavits and exhibits. For those reasons and the reasons outlined below, the court finds
that CFTC is entitled to its requested relief.

i. Injunctive Relief

CFTC seeks injunctive relief against the defendants. Injunctive relief is authorized by
statute. See 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1(a) and (b). Section 13a-1 states that any person who violates the act
may be subject to an order enjoining their actions and ordering compliance with the Act. Jd.
§ 13a-1(a). After a violations of the act is established, CFTC need only show a likelihood of
future violations. CFTC v. British Am. Commodity Options Corp., 560 F.2d 135, 141 (2d Cir.
1977). A violations has been established, and CFTC argues that, given the repetitive and ongoing
nature of the defendants’ fraud, there is a reasonable likelihood that the two will continue to
engage in fraudulent activities. This court agrees. CFTC’s request for an injunction is
ALLOWED. Defendants David Mayhew and Ron McCullough are hereby restrained, enjoined
and prohibited from either directly or indirectly:

a. cheating or defrauding or attempting to cheat or defraud, or willfully or

recklessly deceiving or attempting to deceive other persons in or in connection

with off-exchange agreements, contracts, or transactions in foreign currency that

are leveraged or margined, made or to be made, for or on behalf of, or with, other

persons, in violations of 7 U.S.C. §§ 6b(a)(2)(A) and (C), and 17 C.F_R. §§
5.2(b)(1) and (3);

b. willfully providing false information to others, thereby causing them to
issue false account statements, in or in connection with off-exchange agreements,
contracts, or transactions in foreign currency that are leveraged or margined,
made or to be made, for or on behalf of, or with, other persons, in violations of 7
U,S.C. § 6b(a)(2)(B) and 17 C.F.R. § 5.2(b)(2);

5

Case 5:14-cv-00083-F Document 37 Filed 08/14/15 Page 5 of 11
 

c. aiding, abetting, counseling, inducing, procuring or working in
combination or concert with each other to violate the Act or Regulations, in
violations of 7 U.S.C. § 13c(a);

d. trading on or subject to the rules of any registered entity (as that term is
defined in 7 U.S.C. § 1a(40) (2012));

€. entering into any transactions involving commodity interests (as that term
is defined in 17 C.F.R. § 1.3(yy) (2014)) for their own personal accounts or for
any account in which they have a direct or indirect interest;

f, having any commodity interests traded on their behalf;

g. controlling or directing the trading for or on behalf of any other person or
entity, whether by power of attorney or otherwise, in any account involving
commodity interests;

h. soliciting, receiving, or accepting any funds from any person for the
purpose of purchasing or selling any commodity interests;

i. applying for registration or claiming exemption from registration with the
Commission in any capacity, and engaging in any activity requiring such
registration or exemption from registration with the Commission, except as
provided for in 17 C.F.R. § 4.14(a)(9) (2014); and

j. acting as a principal (as that term is defined in 17 C.F.R. § 3.1(a) (2014)),
agent or any other officer or employee of any person (as that term is defined in 7
U.S.C. § 1a(38) (2012)) registered, required to be registered or exempted from
registration with the Commission, except as provided for 17 C.F.R. § 4.14(a)(9)
(2014).

Monetary Relief

CFTC seeks monetary relief against the defendants. A judgement by default may be

entered without a hearing on damages when the amount is capable of being ascertained from
definite figures contained in detailed affidavits. J & J Sports Prods., Inc. v. Waters, No. 3:11-
CV-552-MU, 2013 WL 3353904, at *1 (W.D.N.C. Jul. 3, 2013). Furthermore, as previously
stated, all the well-pleaded factual allegations in the Complaint are deemed admitted, and the
defendants are deemed liable. Ryan, 253 F.3d at 780. CFTC requests that the court enter default
judgment in the amount of $1,223,388.43 for restitution to Mayhew and McCullough’s

defrauded customers and a civil monetary penalty of $2,486,620.00.

Restitution is authorized here by Title 7, United States Code section 13a-1. The district
court has the authority to order equitable relief in the form of restitution when a defendant is
found to be in violations of the Commodity Exchange Act. See CFTC v. Co Petro Mktg. Grp.,
Inc., 680 F.2d 573, 583 (9th Cir. 1982). CFTC argues that “the objectives of the [Commodity
Exchange] Act are best served by ordering full restitution to Defendants’ customers.” P1.’s
Mem. Supp. Mot. Default J. [DE-27] at 16. The court agrees.

To determine the appropriate amount of restitution, courts calculate the amount given to
the defendant by investors and subtract any amount returned to investors. CFTC v. Noble Wealth
Data Info. Servs., Inc., 90 F. Supp. 2d 676, 693 (D. Md. 2000) overruled on other grounds by
CFTC v. Baragosh, 278 F.3d 319 (4th Cir. 2002). This restitution request is supported by a
number of detailed investigator affidavits and exhibits. See Declaration of Defendants’ Customer
James Perry Fergus, Jr. [DE-32]; Exhibits [DE-34]; Exhibits [DE-35]; and Exhibits [DE-36].
These exhibits outline the amounts of money given to the defendants by each of the defrauded
investors. The requested amount of restitution is the total amount of funds received from
defrauded customers—$2,03 1,388.43——less the amount returned to customers—$808,000—
which results in a total of $1,223,388.43 in allowable restitution. CFTC’s request for restitution
is ALLOWED.

Section 13a-1 also authorizes the court to order a civil monetary penalty (“CMP”). The
relevant portion of the statute states that in any action brought under the section, a person found
to be in violations of the section may be ordered to pay a civil penalty of $100,000 or three times
the monetary gain of each violations, whichever is greater. 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1(d)(1). Here, three

times the monetary gain of the fraud, the gain being $828,873.29, is greater than the minimum

7

Case 5:14-cv-00083-F Document 37 Filed 08/14/15 Page 7 of 11
 

$100,000. Thus, entry of a CMP in the amount of $2,486,619.87 is appropriate. In accordance

with the rules outlined in the statute, CFTC’s request for CMP is ALLOWED.

Til.

CONCLUSION
It is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that

1. the requested injunctive relief is granted. The Defendants, David Mayhew and
Ron McCullough, are hereby restrained, enjoined and prohibited from the actions
described in this Order at section II(b)(i), paragraphs a-j;

2. that the Defendants shall pay, jointly and severally, restitution in the amount of
$1,223,388.43 (“Restitution Obligation”), plus post-judgment interest. Post-judgment
interest shall accrue on the Restitution Obligation beginning on the date of entry of this
Order and shall be determined by using the Treasury Bill rate prevailing on the date of
entry of this Order, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1961;

3. that the Defendants are also accused in a criminal action charging them, in part,
for the misconduct that is at issue in this matter. See United States v. McCullough, Crim
No, 5:13-CR-199-F (E.D.N.C.) (“Criminal Action”). For amounts disbursed to the
Defendants’ customers as a result of satisfaction of any restitution ordered in the
Criminal Action, the defendants shall receive a dollar-for-dollar credit against the
Restitution Obligation. Within ten (10) days of disbursement in the Criminal Action to
the Defendants’ customers, the defendants shall, under a cover letter that identifies the
name and docket number of this proceeding, transmit to the Chief Financial Officer,
CFTC, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20581, and the
Office of Administration, National Futures Association, 300 South Riverside Plaza, Suite
1800, Chicago, IL 60606, copies of the form of payment to those customers;

4, that to effect payment of the Restitution Obligation and the distribution of any
restitution payments to the defendants’ customers, the court appoints the National Futures
Association (“NFA”) as monitor. The monitor shall collect restitution payments from the
Defendants and make distributions as set forth below. Because the monitor is acting as an
officer of this court in performing these services, the NFA shall not be liable for any
action or inaction arising from NFA’s appointment as monitor, other than actions
involving fraud;

5, that the Defendants shall make Restitution Obligation payments under this Order
to the monitor in the name “McCullough-Mayhew — Settlement/Restitution Fund” and
shall send such Restitution Obligation payments by electronic funds transfer, or by U.S.
postal money order, certified check, bank cashier’s, or bank money order, to the Office of
Administration, National Futures Association, 300 South Riverside Plaza, Suite 1800,
Chicago, Illinois 60606, with a cover letter that identifies the paying Defendant(s) and the
name and docket number of this proceeding. The Defendants shall simultaneously

8

Case 5:14-cv-00083-F Document 37 Filed 08/14/15 Page 8 of 11
 

transmit copies of the cover letter and the form of payment to the Chief Financial Officer,
CFTC, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20581;

6. that the monitor shall oversee the Restitution Obligation and shall have the
discretion to determine the manner of distribution of such funds in an equitable fashion to
the Defendants’ customers identified by the Commission or may defer distribution until
such time as the monitor deems appropriate. In the event that the amount of Restitution
Obligation payments to the monitor are of a de minimis nature such that the monitor
determines that the administrative cost of making a distribution to eligible customers is
impractical, the monitor may, in its discretion, treat such restitution payments as CMP
payments, which the monitor shall forward to the Commission following the instructions
for CMP payments set forth in Paragraphs 12 through 13 below;

7. that the Defendants shall cooperate with the monitor as appropriate to provide
such information as the monitor deems necessary and appropriate to identify the
defendants’ customers to whom the monitor, in its sole discretion, may determine to
include in any plan for distribution of any Restitution Obligation payments. The
Defendants shall execute any documents necessary to release funds that they have in any
repository, bank, investment or other financial institution, wherever located, in order to
make partial or total payment toward the Restitution Obligation;

8. that the monitor shall provide the Commission at the beginning of each calendar
year with a report detailing the disbursement of funds to the defendants’ customers
during the previous year. The monitor shall transmit this report under a cover letter that
identifies the name and docket number of this proceeding to the Chief Financial Officer,
CFTC, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20581;

9. that the amounts payable to each customer shall not limit the ability of any
customer from proving that a greater amount is owed from the Defendants or any other
person or entity, and nothing herein shall be construed in any way to limit or abridge the
rights of any customer that exist under state or common law;

10. that pursuant to Rule 71, each customer of the Defendants who suffered a loss is
explicitly made an intended third-party beneficiary of this Order and may seek to enforce
obedience of this Order to obtain satisfaction of any portion of the Restitution Obligation
that has not been paid by the Defendants, to ensure continued compliance with any
provision of this Order and to hold the Defendants in contempt for any violations of any
provision of this Order;

11. that to the extent that any funds accrue to the U.S. Treasury for satisfaction of the
Defendants’ Restitution Obligation, such funds shall be transferred to the monitor for
disbursement in accordance with the procedures set forth above;

12. that the Defendants shall pay, jointly and severally, a CMP in the amount of
$2,486,619.87 (“CMP Obligation”), plus post-judgment interest. Post-judgment interest

9

shall accrue on the CMP Obligation beginning on the date of entry of this Order and shall
be determined by using the Treasury Bill rate prevailing on the date of entry of this
Order, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1961 (2012);

13, that the Defendants shall pay their CMP Obligation by electronic funds transfer,
U.S. postal money order, certified check, bank cashier’s check, or bank money order. If
payment is to be made other than by electronic funds transfer, then the payment shall be
made payable to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and sent to the address

of the cover letter and the form of payment to the Chief Financial Officer, CFTC, Three
Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20581;

14. that Acceptance by the Commission or the monitor of any partial payment of the
defendants’ Restitution Obligation or CMP Obligation shall not be deemed a waiver of
their obligation to make further payments pursuant to this Order, or a waiver of the
Commission’s right to seek to compel payment of any remaining balance;
