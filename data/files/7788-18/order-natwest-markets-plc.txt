ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTIONS 6(c) AND 6(d) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, MAKING
FINDINGS AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

I.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“Commission” or “CFTC” ) has reason to
believe that from in or about January 2013 to the present (the “Relevant Period”), NatWest
Markets Plc, formerly The Royal Bank of Scotland plc, (“Respondent” or “NatWest”) violated
Sections 2(a)(13)(F) and (G) and 4r(a)(3) of the Commodity Exchange Act (the “Act”), 7 U.S.C.
8§ 2(a)(13)(P), (G), 6r(a)(3) (2012), and Commission Regulations (“Regulations”) 43.3(a)(1) and
(3), 43.3(e)(1)q) and (i1), 43.4(a), 45.3(c)(1), 45.4(d)(1)G@), 45.5(b)(2)G), 45.14(a), and
46.3(a)(1)G) and (2)(i), 17 C.F.R. §§ 43.3(a)(1), (3), 43.3 (CDQ), (i), 43.4(a), 45.3(c)(1),
45.4(d)(1)G), 45.5(b)(2)G), 45.14(a), 46.3(a)(1)G), (2)G) (2017). Therefore, the Commission
deems it appropriate and in the public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and
hereby are, instituted to determine whether Respondent engaged in the violations set forth herein
and to determine whether any order should be issued imposing remedial sanctions.

Il.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Respondent has
submitted an Offer of Settlement (“Offer”), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Without admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, Respondent consents to
the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 6(c) and 6(d) of the
Commodity Exchange Act, Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (“Order”) and
acknowledge service of this Order.’

 

' Respondent consents to the entry of this Order and to the use of the findings of fact and conclusions of law in this
Order in this proceeding and in any other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a
party or claimant, and agrees that they shall be taken as true and correct and be given preclusive effect therein,
without further proof. Respondent does not consent, however, to the use of this Order, or the findings or
conclusions herein, as the sole basis for any other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the
Commission is a party or claimant, other than: a proceeding in bankruptcy or receivership; or a proceeding to
II.
The Commission finds the following:
A. SUMMARY

As a provisionally registered swap dealer, NatWest is required to comply with certain
reporting requirements related to its swap transactions. Section 2(a)(13)(F) and (G) of the Act, 7
U.S.C. § 2(a)(13)(B), (G) (2012), (1) requires parties to a swap transaction to report swap
transaction information to a registered swap data repository (“SDR”) in a timely manner as
prescribed by the Commission, and (2) requires all swaps, both cleared and uncleared, to be
reported to a registered SDR. Similarly, Section 4r(a)(3) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 6r(a)(3) (2012),
requires swap dealers to report uncleared swap transactions to an SDR within such time period as
prescribed by the Commission. In particular, the Regulations specify requirements for real-time
public reporting, public availability of swap transaction and pricing data, and reporting of
creation and continuation data to an SDR. See Parts 43, 45, 17 C.F.R. pts. 43, 45 (2017).
Further, the Regulations require swap dealers to make ongoing reports regarding pre-enactment
and transition swaps in existence on or after April 25, 2011. See Part 46, 17 C.F.R. pt. 46
(2017).” The reporting requirements are designed to enhance transparency, promote
standardization, and reduce systemic risk.

During the Relevant Period, NatWest failed to comply with its swap transaction reporting
obligations as a swap dealer under the Act and Regulations. Generally, NatWest under-reported
and over-reported tens of thousands of transactions to an SDR, misreported tens of thousands of
transactions to an SDR, and failed to report hundreds of thousands of pre-enactment transactions
to an SDR in a timely manner. Because of NatWest’s reporting failures, certain data for
numerous swaps transactions both live and historical was not provided to an SDR and was not
disseminated to the market through the real-time public tape. As a result, NatWest failed to
properly report to an SDR hundreds of thousands of swap transactions across all asset classes in
violation of Sections 2(a)(13)(F) and (G) and 4r(a)(3) of the Act, and Regulations 43.3(a)(1) and
(3), 43.3(e)(1)q@) and (i1), 43.4(a), 45.3(c)(1), 45.4(d)(1)@), 45.5(b)(2) a), 45.14(a), and
46.3(a)(1)G) and (2)().

Reporting is at the heart of the Commission’s market and financial surveillance
programs, which are critical to the Commission’s mission to protect market participants and
promote market integrity. Accurate swap data is thus essential to effective fulfillment of the
regulatory functions of the Commission, including meaningful surveillance and enforcement
programs. Moreover, real-time public dissemination of swap transaction and pricing data

 

enforce the terms of this Order. Respondent does not consent to the use of the Offer or this Order, or the findings or
conclusions in this Order, by any other party in any other proceeding.

* Pre-enactment swaps are those swaps executed prior to passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act’), Pub. L. 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376 (2010), and transition swaps are
those entered into between the law’s enactment date and the applicable compliance date for swap data recordkeeping
and reporting. See infra Section IV. Legal Discussion, at p. 5.
supports the fairness and efficiency of markets and increases transparency, which in turn
improves price discovery.

In accepting NatWest’s Offer, the Commission recognizes that NatWest provided
substantial cooperation during the investigation of this matter, and that NatWest has taken
substantial remedial action to address the majority of its reporting deficiencies and will continue
to remediate the minority of deficiencies that still remain. The Commission notes that NatWest’s
cooperation and remediation are recognized in the form of a significantly reduced civil monetary
penalty.

B. RESPONDENT

NatWest Markets Plc is a British banking and financial services company and a non-
United States swap dealer headquartered in the United Kingdom. Under the legal name The
Royal Bank of Scotland plc, NatWest was provisionally registered as a swap dealer with the
Commission on December 31, 2012.

C. FACTS

In or about July 2014, the Commission’s Division of Enforcement (“Division”) began
investigating NatWest for swaps data reporting issues relating to the U.S. person indicator for
certain credit default swaps. While that investigation was ongoing, in late 2014 NatWest
discovered additional deficiencies in its reporting of swaps data pursuant to Parts 43, 45, and 46
of the Regulations that form the subject matter of this Order. In October 2015, after the initial
investigation was closed, NatWest reported to the Commission the additional deficiencies in its
reporting of swaps data.

NatWest subsequently provided Commission staff additional details concerning these
deficiencies and quantified the scope of each issue by identifying asset class, date range, and
number of swaps implicated. NatWest also provided an update on remediation efforts.
According to the information provided by NatWest, NatWest estimated that at least several
hundred thousand swaps in four asset classes° were affected by the identified deficiencies in its
swaps reporting practices during the Relevant Period, which resulted in reporting errors.

Thereafter, beginning on December 16, 2015, to the present, NatWest sent to
Commission staff quarterly updates identifying (1) additional deficiencies in its swaps reporting
practices that NatWest had not initially identified, and (2) updates on remediation efforts. These
deficiencies concerned anywhere from a handful of transactions over a short period of time to
tens of thousands of transactions over a much longer period of time. In addition to providing
Commission staff with quarterly updates on reporting issues and remediation efforts, NatWest
submitted to the Division (1) information identifying other reporting issues that generally have
relatively low affected trade volumes and, per NatWest’s issue rating methodology, have
received lower severity issue ratings, and (2) self-reports of certain reporting issues that NatWest

 

* The asset classes identified by NatWest were Rates, Credit, Equities, and foreign exchange (“FX”).

3
identified after submitting the most recent quarterly update at that time and that it believed
warranted a disclosure to the Division before the next quarterly update.

Based on the Division’s investigation, including a review of NatWest’s disclosures,
during the Relevant Period, NatWest had multiple swaps reporting errors across more than 50
discrete areas. Primarily, these swaps reporting errors centered on NatWest’s inability to timely
and properly report to an SDR swaps creation data, swaps continuation data, unique swap
identifiers (“USI”), pre-enactment swap transactions, and corrected swaps data.

In particular, NatWest failed to properly report to an SDR the swap creation data,
including all primary economic terms for the swap, for a number of off-facility swaps not subject
to mandatory clearing during the Relevant Period. For example, NatWest failed to report tens of
thousands of inter-affiliate swap transactions in the FX asset class. Similarly, NatWest failed to
report tens of thousands of swap transactions in FX with certain counterparties due to a problem
with its data system lacking a classification for the counterparties. NatWest further inaccurately
sub-categorized tens of thousands of transactions in rates as exotic rather than non-exotic
transactions. NatWest also failed to properly report to an SDR swap continuation data and all
life cycle event data, including all changes to the primary economic terms of the swap, for a
number of uncleared swaps during the Relevant Period.

NatWest further failed to properly report to an SDR the USI for a number of its off-
facility swaps during the Relevant Period. For example, after certain life cycle events occurred
for FX transactions (e.g., cancels and re-keys, allocations, manual exercises, and novations), the
trade’s USI was not being populated in NatWest’s reports for the post life cycle event trade such
that the two trades were not linked properly in SDR records.

Moreover, NatWest failed to report in a timely manner to an SDR the required primary
economic terms and continuation data for hundreds of thousands of pre-enactment swap
transactions in the rates and credit asset classes that were in existence on or after April 25, 2011,
during the Relevant Period.

Finally, during the Relevant Period, when NatWest initially learned of its errors and
omissions with respect to its various reporting failures, it did not promptly submit corrected data
to the SDR nor did it promptly notify the SDR of the errors and omissions in its previously
reported data. After the Division had begun its investigation into NatWest’s swaps data
reporting practices, and after NatWest reported certain deficiencies to the Commission, NatWest
then notified the SDR of these errors and omissions and submitted corrected data to the SDR.

These are just some examples of the multiple issues that NatWest encountered with its
swaps reporting obligations across multiple asset classes.

Since the Division began its investigation into NatWest’s deficiencies with its swaps
reporting practices, NatWest has cooperated with staff, and has remediated the majority of its
swap reporting issues. Among other things, after the Division began investigating NatWest’s
swaps data reporting practices, NatWest identified swaps data reporting deficiencies for staff on
a rolling basis, and NatWest undertook substantial remediation efforts in an effort to fix the
deficiencies. NatWest undertook to explain to staff the mechanics of NatWest’s swaps data
reporting systems, control procedures, and governance structure used to identify and address
reporting issues. NatWest also provided staff with quarterly updates regarding its remediation
efforts as well as other submissions made outside of the quarterly update process — specifically,
compilations of reporting issues with relatively low affected trade volumes that occurred during
the Relevant Period, and self-reports of certain reporting issues that NatWest discovered after the
most recent quarterly update at that time and that it believed warranted a disclosure to the
Division before the next quarterly update. NatWest’s disclosures demonstrate that, as of the date
of this Order, NatWest already has remediated the majority of its swaps reporting deficiencies
and that only a minority of deficiencies remain that still require remediation. In recognition of
this substantial cooperation and remediation, the civil monetary penalty has been significantly
reduced.

IV.
LEGAL DISCUSSION

To enhance transparency, promote standardization, and reduce systemic risk, Section 727
of the Dodd-Frank Act, 124 Stat. at 1696-97, added to the Act provisions that (1) require the
parties to a swap to report swap transaction information to the appropriate registered entity in a
timely manner as prescribed by the Commission, and (2) require all swaps, both cleared and
uncleared, to be reported to a registered SDR. See Sections 2(a)(13)(F) and (G) of the Act,
7TUS.C. § 2(a)(13)(F), (G) (2012). Likewise, Section 4r(a)(3) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 6r(a)(3)
(2012), requires swap dealers to report uncleared swap transactions to an SDR within such time
period as prescribed by the Commission. Pursuant to these requirements, the Commission
adopted implementing reporting regulations, including those under Parts 43, 45, and 46 of the
Regulations, 17 C.F.R. pts. 43, 45, 46 (2017). The reporting requirements under those
regulations were phased-in over time based upon asset class. See Real-Time Public Reporting of
Swap Transaction Data, 77 Fed. Reg. 1182 (Jan. 9, 2012); Swap Data Recordkeeping and
Reporting Requirements, 77 Fed. Reg. 2136 (Jan. 13, 2012).

Part 43 establishes requirements for the real-time public reporting and public
availability of swap transaction data. See Regulation 43.2 and 43.3, 17 C.F.R. §§ 43.2, 43.3
(2017). Under Part 43, reporting parties must report a publicly reportable swap transaction to
an SDR as soon as technologically practicable after the swap transaction is executed. See
Regulation 43.3(a)(1), 17 C.F.R. § 43.3(a)(1) (2017) (“A reporting party shall report any
publicly reportable swap transaction to a registered swap data repository as soon as
technologically practicable after such publicly reportable swap transaction is executed.”); see
also Regulation 43.4(a), 17 C.F.R. § 43.4(a) (2017) (“Swap transaction and pricing information
shall be reported to a registered swap data repository so that the registered swap data repository
can publicly disseminate swap transaction and pricing data in real-time.”). The reporting
requirement for a reporting party includes reporting all off-facility swaps to an SDR.
Regulation 43.3(a)(3), 17 C.F.R § 43.3(a)(3) (2017). A publicly reportable swap transaction is
defined in Regulation 43.2 and includes, among other things, “[a]ny termination, assignment,
novation, exchange, transfer, amendment, conveyance, or extinguishing of rights or obligations
of a swap that changes the pricing of a swap.” See Regulation 43.2, 17 C.F.R § 43.2 (2017).
Further, under Part 43, if a reporting party to a swap becomes aware of an error or omission in

5
the swap transaction or pricing data which it reported to an SDR, the reporting party shall notify
the SDR of the error or omission and shall promptly submit corrected data to the SDR. See
Regulation 43.3(e)(1)G) and (ii), 17 C.F.R. § 43.3(e)(1)G), Gi) (2017).

Part 45 requires reporting parties to, among other things, report swap creation and
continuation data to ensure that all data concerning a swap remains current and accurate. See
Regulations 45.3 and 45.4, 17 C.F.R. §§ 45.3, 45.4 (2017). Specifically, Regulation 45.3(c)(1)
requires that for all off-facility swaps in the credit, equity, FX, and interest rate asset classes
not subject to mandatory clearing requirements, a swap dealer that is a reporting counterparty
must report to an SDR all primary economic term data for the swap within the time prescribed
by the Regulation. See 17 C.F.R. § 45.3(c)(1) (2017). Similarly, reporting parties can comply
with the continuation data requirement by “reporting life cycle event data or state data for the
swap.” See Regulation 45.4(a), 17 C.F.R. § 45.4(a) (2017). The Regulations define a life
cycle event to include “any event that would result in either a change to a primary economic
term of a swap or to any primary economic terms data previously reported to a swap data
repository in connection with a swap,” including among other things, a “partial or full
termination of the swap,” a “change to the end date for the swap,” and “a change in the cash
flows or rates originally reported.” See Regulation 45.1, 17 C.F.R. § 45.1 (2017). Part 45 also
requires that for all uncleared swaps, the reporting counterparty must report all swap
continuation data, including life cycle event data, to an SDR on the same day that the life cycle
event occurred. See Regulation 45.4(d)(1)G), 17 C.F.R. § 45.4(d)(1)G) (2017). Part 45 further
requires that for each off-facility swap where the reporting counterparty is a swap dealer, the
reporting counterparty shall transmit a USI for the swap to an SDR. See Regulation
45.5(b)(2)G), 17 C.F.R. § 45.5(b)(2)() (2017). Finally, under Part 45, the reporting
counterparty must report a correction of errors or omissions as soon as technologically
practicable after discovery of the error. See Regulation 45.14(a), 17 C.F.R. § 45.14(a) (2017).

Part 46 requires swap dealers to make ongoing reports regarding pre-enactment and
transition swaps. In particular Regulation 46.3(a) requires that for each pre-enactment swap or
transition swap in existence on or after April 25, 2011, the reporting counterparty shall report to
an SDR among other things the minimum primary economic terms as well as continuation data
of the swap. See Regulations 46.3(a)(1)@) and (2)G), 17 C.F.R. §§ 46.3(a)(1)G), (2)G) (2017).

The accuracy and completeness of swap reporting are critical to the Commission’s
mission to protect market participants and to ensure market integrity. See, e.g., In re Deutsche
Bank AG, CFTC No. 15-40, 2015 WL 5783049 (Sept. 30, 2015) (consent order); In re ICE
Futures U.S., Inc., CFTC No. 15-17, 2015 WL 1276463 (Mar. 16, 2015) (consent order); Jn re
Société Générale §.A., CFTC No. 17-01, 2016 WL 7210405 (Dec. 7, 2016) (consent order).
Market participants rely upon the public availability of swaps data for price discovery purposes.
The Commission, in turn, requires complete and accurate reporting data to engage in meaningful
oversight of the swaps market.

During the Relevant Period, NatWest failed to: (1) properly report to an SDR the swap
creation data, including all primary economic terms for the swap, for a number of off-facility
swaps not subject to mandatory clearing; (2) properly report to an SDR swap continuation data
and all life cycle event data, including all changes to the primary economic terms of the swap,
for a number of uncleared swaps; (3) properly report to an SDR the USI for a number of its off-
facility swaps; (4) report in a timely manner to an SDR the required primary economic terms and
continuation data for hundreds of thousands of pre-enactment swap transactions in the rates and
credit asset classes that were in existence on or after April 25, 2011; and (5) promptly submit
corrected data to the SDR or to promptly notify an SDR of the errors and omissions in its
previously reported data once NatWest learned of its errors and omissions with respect to its
various reporting failures. The foregoing acts, omissions, and failures of NatWest’s employees
occurred within the scope of their employment, office, or agency with NatWest; therefore,
pursuant to Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.D. §2(a)(1)(B) (2012), and Regulation 1.2, 17
C.F.R. § 1.2 (2017), NatWest is liable for those acts, omissions, and failures in violation of
Sections 2(a)(13)(F) and (G) and 4r(a)(3) of the Act, and Regulations 43.3(a)(1) and (3),
43.3(e)(1)@) and (ii), 43.4(a), 45.3(c)(1), 45.4(d)(1)G), 45.5(b)(2)G), 45.14(a), and 46.3(a)(1)@)
and (2)(1).

V.
FINDINGS OF VIOLATION
