I.
SUMMARY

1. | Between October 2011 and the present (the “relevant time period”),
Defendants Christopher Valois (“Valois”) and Cynthia Wong (“Wong”), acting by
and through Defendants Bertram Trade LLC (“Bertram Trade”) and Churchhill
Commodities Trading LLC (“Churchhill” or “Churchill”) (collectively
“Defendants”), solicited, obtained or mananged approximately $750,000 from six
customers, some of whom were senior citizens. Of those funds, Defendants
fraudulently solicited approximately $450,000 to purchase precious metals and to
engage in futures trading. In addition, Defendants also managed approximately
$300,000 in managed futures accounts even though they were not registered to do
SO.

2. The precious metals transactions offered by Valois and Wong and
their companies, Bertram Trade LLC and Churchill Commodities Trading LLC,
were illegal off-exchange instruments after July 16, 2011. Moreover, on
information and belief, Valois and Wong misappropriated at least $300,000 sent
for the purpose of purchasing precious metals or for trading futures for their

customers and instead used those customer funds to pay their personal expenses.

3. Valois and Wong held themselves out as commodity trading advisors
(“CTAs”) without being registered with the Commission in any capacity.
Moreover, Valois was disqualified from registration because he had been banned
from the futures industry for cheating and defrauding customers.

4. By virtue of this conduct and the conduct further described herein,
Defendants have engaged, are engaging, or are about to engage in offering to enter
into, entering into, executing, confirming the execution of, illegal off-exchange
precious metals transactions, in violation of Section 4(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.

§ 6(a), and fraud in connection with retail commodity transactions by
misrepresentation, omission and misappropriation, in violation of Section
4b(a)(2)(A) and (C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 6b(a)(2)(A), (C). Further, Defendants
Valois and Wong have engaged, are engaging, or are about to engage in fraud in
connection with exchange-traded commodity futures contracts, in violation of
Section 4b(a){1)(A) and (C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 6b(a)(1)(A) and (C); acting as
CTAs without benefit of registration with the Commission, in violation of Section
4m(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 6m(1); and CTA fraud, in violation of Section 40(1)
of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 60(1).

5. Accordingly, pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1(a),
the CFTC brings this action to enjoin Defendants’ unlawful acts and practices,
compel their compliance with the Act, and further enjoin them from engaging in

any commodity-related activity.

6. In addition, the Commission seeks civil monetary penalties and
remedial ancillary relief, including, but not limited to, trading and registration
bans, restitution, disgorgement, rescission, pre- and post-judgment interest, and
other such relief as the Court may deem necessary and appropriate.

7. Unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, Defendants are likely to
continue to engage in the acts and practices alleged in this Complaint and similar
acts and practices, as more fully described below.

Il.
JURISDICTION AND VENUE

8. The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 6c of
the Act, 7 U.S.C. §13a-1(a), which authorizes the Commission to seek injunctive
relief in district court against any person whenever it shall appear to the
Commission that such person has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in
any act or practice constituting a violation of any provision of the Act or any rule,
regulation, or order thereunder.

9. The Commission has jurisdiction over the Defendants’ precious
metals transactions pursuant to Section 2(c)(2)(D) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.

§ 2(c)(2)(D), which, after July 16, 2011, gives the Commission jurisdiction over
“any agreement, contract, or transaction in any commodity” that is entered into
with, or offered to, a non-eligible contract participant (“ECP”) “on a leveraged or

margined basis, or financed by the offeror, the counterparty, or a person acting in

concert with the offeror or counterparty on a similar basis” (“retail commodity
transactions”), subject to certain exceptions not applicable here.

10. Venue properly lies with this Court pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the
Act, 7 U.S.C. §13a-1(e) (2012), because Defendants are found in, inhabit, or
transact business in this District, or the acts and practices in violation of the Act
occurred, are occurring, or are about to occur within this District, among other
places.

III.
PARTIES

11. The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an independent
federal regulatory agency charged by Congress with the responsibility for
administering and enforcing the provisions of the Act, 7 U.S.C. §§ 1 et seq., and the
Commission’s Regulations promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. §§ 1.1 et seq. (2013).

12. Christopher Valois resides in Irvine, California. Valois was registered
with the Commission intermittently between 1998 and 2009 as a CTA, introducing
broker (“IB”) and associated person (“AP”). However, since August 2009, Valois
has not been registered with the Commission in any capacity. In August 2010, the
National Futures Association (“NFA”), the self-regulatory organization designated
by Plaintiff CFTC to register futures industry professionals, permanently barred
Valois from NFA membership for making deceptive and misleading sales
solicitations, using misleading and deceptive promotional material, and

unauthorized trading of customer accounts, among other things. In the NFA’s

decision to permanently bar Valois, it found that “Valois has no regard for the
[futures] regulatory structure . . . and poses a threat to customer protection.”

13. Cynthia Wong resides in Irvine, California. Wong was never been
registered with the Commission in any capacity. Wong is married to Valois.
Wong formed Bertram Trade and upon information and belief operated it with
Valois.

14. Bertram Trade LLC is a California limited liability company which
had a business address of 7 Cobalt Drive, Dana Point, California 92629 from
March 2009 to October 2011. Valois and Wong formed Bertram Trade in March
2009 and shut it down in approximately October 2011. Bertram Trade maintained
a website at www.bertramtrade.com during the same time period. Bertram
purportedly offered leveraged investments in precious metals to retail customers.
Bertram Trade has never been registered with the Commission in any capacity.

15. Churchhill Commodities Trading LLC is a California limited liability
company which has used a business address of 17266 Candleberry, Irvine,
California 92612 since March 2012. Valois and Wong formed Churchill in March
2012 after shutting Bertram down. Churchill’s website at \
www.churchillcommoditiestrading.com is identical to Bertram Trade’s former

website and is still active. Churchill has never been registered with the

Commission in any capacity.

IV.
FACTS

A. Defendants Valois and Wong’s Fraudulent Solicitation of

Over $400,000 from Customer A and Misappropriation of

Customer A’s Funds

16. Until approximately October 2011, Bertram Trade’s website claimed
that:

e the company “buys and stores gold for customers,”

e customers can “buy up to six times more gold than [their]
deposited funds,”

e customers’ gold is “insured and stored securely in [Bertram’s]
bullion vaults,” and

e purchases of gold through Bertram Trade will “help safeguard
wealth against financial instability.”

17. As described in paragraphs 18 to 28 below, defendants Valois and
Wong, individually and as employees or agents of Bertram Trade, fraudulently
solicited at least $407,000 from at least one customer between May and November
2011, and thereafter failed to disclose to the customer the status of his investments.

18. Customer A, a retired, 73-year-old resident of Long Beach, California,
met an account executive (“AE”) who worked for Valois and Wong in 2011.
Customer A and the AE discussed the investments that Customer A maintained in
his individual retirement account (“IRA”) at Fidelity Investments (“Fidelity”). The
AE told Customer A that he worked for Bertram Trade, which he said was an
investment firm that purchased gold on behalf of clients. The AE told Customer A

that gold was a safe investment and that the price of gold was poised to start rising.
The AE also told Customer A that purchasing gold through Bertram Trade was a
less risky investment for his retirement funds than keeping them in his IRA at
Fidelity.

19. The AE then introduced Customer A to Valois, whom the AE stated
was the owner of Bertram Trade. Valois showed Customer A charts and other
documents touting his purported successful futures trading performance and told
Customer A that he could also make money if he allowed Valois to trade futures
and options for him. Valois also told Customer A that his account at Bertram
Trade would operate in the same manner as his Fidelity retirement account. These
representations convinced Customer A to transfer $407,000, representing nearly all
of his funds from his retirement account at Fidelity, to Bertram Trade, various
futures accounts, and a Wong personal account in a series of transactions between
May and October 2011.

20. Customer A made two investments totaling $175,000 with Bertram
Trade to purchase gold in May 2011.

21. Following Customer A’s $175,000 investment, Valois and Bertram
Trade sent $125,000 of Customer A’s funds to a purported metals company and
Valois and Wong immediately used the remaining $50,000 for their personal
expenses. The customer never took delivery of any gold. Valois and Bertram
never returned any portion of the $175,000 investment to the customer even though

the purported metals dealer had sent $100,000 to Valois and Bertram in the
following 10 months.

22. Meanwhile, in approximately June 2011, Valois introduced Customer
A to Wong, whom he said worked for Bertram Trade. In June 2011, Customer A
authorized the transfer of an additional $100,000 of his retirement funds to a
commodity futures trading account that Wong and Valois opened in Customer A’s
name at a futures commission merchant (“FCM”). Wong had trading authority
over the account and was listed as the investment advisor for Customer A’s
account.

23. Valois and Wong failed to disclose to Customer A the risks of
investing in futures contracts. Between June 2011 and approximately November
2011, Valois and Wong lost virtually all of Customer A’s funds trading in foreign
currency, agricultural and e-mini futures contracts. However, neither Valois nor
Wong informed Customer A about the trading losses.

24. In July 2011, Customer A wired yet another $60,000 to Wong to be
used either to purchase precious metals through Bertram Trade or to trade futures
in his trading account at the FCM. Wong wired approximately $10,000 of these
funds to a purported metals company. Wong misappropriated the rest of the funds
by wiring some of the funds to her personal futures account held at the same FCM,
where she used the funds to trade in futures contracts for herself, and used the
remaining funds for personal expenses. Wong lost virtually all of Customer A’s

funds that Wong traded in her personal futures account by approximately February
2012. However, Wong did not inform Customer A about the trading losses.

25. In or about August 2011, Valois and Wong convinced Customer A to
set up a limited liability shell corporation called Customer A Enterprises LLC
(“Customer A Enterprises”) to use for his precious metals and futures investments
with them. The AE and Wong accompanied Customer A to the bank and assisted
Customer A in opening a bank account in the name of Customer A Enterprises. In
October 2011, Wong deposited a $72,000 check drawn on the Customer A
Enterprises bank account into a Bertram Trade bank account that she controlled.
Customer A did not issue this check from the Customer A Enterprises bank
account to Wong, and Wong did not disclose to Customer A that she had received
funds from the Customer A Enterprises bank account. Wong misappropriated
these funds by trading approximately $68,000 in her personal futures account and
using the rest for personal expenses. Virtually all of Customer A’s funds that
Wong traded in her personal futures account were lost in trading.

26. Valois and Wong failed to disclose how they were using Customer
A’s funds. When Customer A specifically asked Valois about his funds, Valois
failed to provide information showing the amount and status of the customer’s
investment. Unknown to Customer A, virtually all of his funds were being
dissipated through either trading losses or through personal expenditures by Valois
and Wong.

27. Customer A eventually suspected he had been defrauded. Customer
A tried to connect to the Bertram Trade website only to find that the website was
no longer online. Customer A then tried contacting Valois and the AE by
telephone with the contact numbers they had previously given him, only to find
that the numbers were disconnected.

28. Customer A’s $407,000 in investments with Valois, Wong, the AE
and Bertram Trade as described above represented nearly the entirety of his
retirement savings. To date, Valois, Wong and Bertram Trade have not told
Customer A what happened to his investments. Customer A now lives in an
assisted living facility and survives mainly on social security and proceeds from a
small annuity.

B. Defendants Valois and Wong’s Fraudulent Solicitation of Over $35,000
From Customer B and Misappropriation of Customer B’s Funds

29. In or about October 2011, Valois and Wong terminated operation of
the Bertram Trade website and shortly thereafter, in March 2012, formed
Churchill. Churchill also purports to be a precious metals company and its website
is identical to the former Bertram Trade website. The Churchill website is still
active.

30. The Churchill website claims that:

e the company “buys and stores gold for customers,”

e customers can “buy up to six times more gold than [their]
deposited funds,”

11

e customers’ gold is “insured and stored securely in [Churchill’s]
bullion vaults,” and

e purchases of gold through Churchill will “help safeguard wealth
against financial instability.”

Upon information and belief, Churchill did not buy and store gold for customers
and did not possess or maintain any vaults holding precious metals. Moreover,
purchases of gold through Churchill were highly risky and did not provide any
protection for its customers.

31. Customer B is a 60 year old man who resides in Springfield, Illinois,
and runs a small business that repairs restaurant and convenience store equipment.
32. As described in paragraphs 33 to 41 below, between March and
December 2013, Valois solicited and obtained approximately $35,500 in four
transactions from Customer B for the purpose of purchasing precious metals

through Churchill.

33. In or about March 2013, Valois solicited Customer B to invest in
precious metals through Churchill. Valois presented himself to Customer B as the
owner of Churchill and told Customer B that gold would be stored on Customer
B’s behalf and would be available for shipment to Customer B at any time.

34. Further, Valois told Customer B that Churchill’s policies required that
customers purchase a minimum of 15 ounces of gold per purchase and that the

Churchill gold investment used a 2:1 leverage, meaning that the customer would

only need to put up enough money to purchase 7.5 ounces but would have 15
ounces of gold in the customer’s account.

35. Onor about March 11, 2013, Customer B wired $15,000 to a bank
account held in Churchill’s name, controlled by Valois. Upon information and
belief, neither Valois nor Churchill purchased or stored precious metals on behalf
of Customer B. Instead, Valois misappropriated at least a portion of Customer B’s
funds by trading the funds in speculative derivatives trading and using a portion of
the funds for personal expenses.

36. On the following day, Customer B discovered through an online
search that Valois had been permanently barred from NFA membership for
deceptive sales practices and other conduct. When Customer B asked Valois about
this information, Valois downplayed the significance of the findings by stating that
he settled the matter with the NFA because defending himself against the
complaint would have been too cost prohibitive. However, Valois did not settle
the NFA charges against him. Rather, he refused to attend the hearing prompting
the NFA to find that Valois “has no regard for the regulatory structure in [the
futures] industry and is a threat to customer protection.”

37. Based upon Valois’ assurances as to the insignificance of the NFA bar
and Valois’s continued touting of profits to be made in precious metals, in or about
April 2013, Customer B wired another $15,000 to a bank account held in
Churchill’s name, controlled by Valois. Upon information and belief, Valois did

not in fact purchase precious metals with these funds. Instead, Valois again
misappropriated at least a portion Customer B’s funds by using the funds to trade
speculative derivative contracts and for personal expenses.

38. Valois also solicited Customer B to open a managed futures and forex
trading account. In or about April 2013, Valois told Customer B that he Valois
could open a managed futures account through a friend that would allow Valois to
manage the futures trading in the account without being disclosed as the manager.
Valois told Customer B that Valois would have to operate the account in this way
in order to “get around” the prohibition on trading that was currently imposed upon
him.

39. In about November 2013 and then again in about December 2013,
Valois told Customer B that his precious metals account needed more funds to
meet margin calls. In response, Customer B wired $2,500 in November 2013 and
$3,000 in December 2013 to the Churchill bank account.

40. Inor about January 2014, Valois told Customer B not to cooperate
with the federal government if Customer B should receive any inquiries from the
government about Valois’ activities.

41. In April 2014, Customer B sought delivery of the gold he believed he
had purchased from Valois and Churchill. Valois did not deliver any gold to
Customer B. Instead, Valois told Customer B that gold prices had drastically
declined and returned only $8,100 of Customer B’s original $35,500 investment.

C. Defendants Valois and Wong Acted As Unregistered CTAs

42. Defendants Valois and Wong acted as CTAs by trading the funds of at
least four members of the general public in futures contracts and receiving
advisory fees for such futures trading.

43. For example Wong managed the investment funds of funds of
Customer A by trading them in various commodity futures in accounts held in
Customer A’s name and in the name of Bertram Trade.

44. Valois solicited another customer, Customer C, a 45 year old man
residing in Lansdowne, Virginia. Valois initially solicited the customer through e-
mails advising him to purchase precious metals through Bertram Trade. When that
was unsuccessful, Valois solicited the customer to manage a futures trading
account to hedge Customer C’s oil and gas exploration investments. In June 2011,
Customer C invested $10,000 with Valois for this purpose. Wong was listed as the
authorized trader on Customer C’s futures account held at the same FCM as the
others, but Valois traded the customer’s account. Valois lost over half of Customer
C’s funds within two months of trading; upon demand, Customer C received back
approximately $4,000 of his funds.

45. Valois managed the funds of at least two other customers including
$24,500 from a 75 year old retiree and $250,000 from a commodity pool by

trading these funds in managed commodity futures accounts

46. Atthe time Valois and Wong solicited, managed and traded the funds

V.
STATUTORY BACKGROUND

47. Sections 2(c)(2)(D) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. §§ 2(c)(2)(D), which became
effective July 16, 2011, gives the Commission jurisdiction over Defendants’ retail
commodity transactions in precious metals because they were commodity
transactions offered to non-ECP’s on a financed, leveraged, or margined basis.

48. The Act defines an ECP, in relevant part, as an individual who has
amounts invested on a discretionary basis, the aggregate of which exceeds $10
million, or $5 million if the individual enters into the transaction to manage the risk
associated with an asset owned or liability incurred, or reasonably likely to be
