' If an FX trader has orders to sell of the first currency listed in any currency pair, it is often referred to as being on the left-hand side, or
“Ths.” If an FX trader references right hand side, or “rhs,” it indicates that the FX trader 1s a buyer of the first currency listed in a

currency pair.

Traders from Two Banks “Double Team” to Attempt to Manipulate Fix

 

(Barclays, JPMorgan)

At 3:43:50, a trader from Bank W asked a trader from Bank Y whether he needed to buy Euros in the market in
the forthcoming fix. The Bank Y trader responded that he had a net buy order for the fix, which he subsequently
confirmed as totaling EUR105 million. At 3:44:04, the Bank Y trader offered to transfer that net buy order to the

Bank W trader. The Bank W trader replied “maybe” and then stated that he had a net buy order for EUR 150
million.

The traders had the following exchange:

Bank W Trader: 3:46:53 i'd prefer we join forces
Bank Y Trader: 3:46:56 Perfick

3:46:59 lets do this...
Bank Y Trader: 3:47:11 lets double team them
Bank W Trader: 3:47:12 YESssssssssssss

Immediately after the fixing window, the traders congratulated themselves:

Bank W Trader: 4:03:25 sml rumour we haven’t lost it
Bank Y Trader: 4:03:45 we

4:03:46 do

4:03:48 dollarrr

 

Traders Share Their “Scores”
(Barclays, UBS)

In another chat, traders for Bank W and three other Banks exchanged positions leading into the WM/R 4 p.m.
fix. The Bank Y trader said “it cant be a good day to be [right hand side].” Once the four traders determined
they were all the same direction, the Bank W trader asked if “we gonna be able to get it to 05” to which the
Bank Y trader responded “is that the troyal fkn we.” After the fixing window closed the Bank X trader said
“nice call” and the chat room members gave their “scores” or profits from the fix. The chat room members each
claimed they made between $60,000 and $220,000.

Traders Attempt to Manipulate Fix by False Submissions

 

(Barclays)

In one chat a RUB/USD trader suggested “we should all lower fix by several kopecks” to which another trader
replied “yes.” A third trader agreed that “it is a right idea to lower the fix by a few kopecks.” The Bank W trader
responded “so what, 5 kopecks and all/everyone is splendid.” After that conversation, the Bank W trader
submitted an artificially low indicative bid and offer to the CME, consistent with his conversation with the other
traders, that was used by the CME to calculate the final CME/EMTA Rate.
