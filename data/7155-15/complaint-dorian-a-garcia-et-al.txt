COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF AND
PENALTIES UNDER THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT

The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC” or “Commission”), by and

through its attorneys, hereby alleges as follows:

IL SUMMARY
i This matter involves a fraudulent scheme by Dorian A. Garcia, individually and
as principal and controlling person of DG Wealth Management (“DG Wealth”), Macroquantum
Capital LLC (““Macroquantum”), UKUSA Currency Fund LP (“‘UKUSA”) (collectively,
“Garcia” or Defendants”), and at least two other unincorporated entities controlled by Garcia, to

defraud approximately 80 members of the public (“investors”) of approximately $4.7 million in
Case 2:15-cv-00237-Sia@ CM Document 3 Filed 04/1411 Sa age 2 of 34 PagelD 11

connection with pooled investments in retail off-exchange foreign currency contracts (“forex”)
ona leveraged or margined basis, commodity options, and a variety of other investment
schemes.

2: From at least May 2010 through the present (the “Relevant Period”), when
soliciting actual and prospective investors and pool participants, Garcia made misrepresentations
and omitted material facts, including but not limited to: (1) falsely promising that their principal
was protected with a large, cash collateral account; (2) misrepresenting the total amount of funds
managed; (3) falsely reporting historically large profits in existing trading accounts; and (4) that
he misappropriated investor funds.

De During the relevant time, out of the approximate $4.7 million received from
investors, the Defendants returned nearly $2.1 million to investors in a manner akin to a Ponzi
scheme, and, on information and belief, misappropriated at least $2.5 million of investor funds
that Garcia used to pay for his personal and business expenses such as art, domestic help,
jewelry, and cash transfers made to Garcia’s personal bank accounts. Garcia also issued false
account statements to at least one investor, commingled pool participant funds with his personal
and business funds in multiple bank accounts, and failed to disclose that his registrations with the
Commission had been withdrawn. Garcia also solicited investors to permit him to secretly
manage the trading in the investors’ individually owned forex accounts although neither Garcia
nor any of his companies were ever registered with the Commission as commodity trading
advisors (“CTAs”).

4, By virtue of this conduct and the conduct further described below, Defendants
have engaged, are engaging in, or are about to engage in fraud in violation of the Commodity

Exchange Act (““CEA” or “Act”), 7 U.S.C. §§ 1 ef seq. (2012), and Commission Regulations
Case 2:15-cv-00237-SR@CM Document 3 Filed 04/14/15 a age 3 of 34 PagelD 12

(“Regulations”), 17 C.F.R. §§ 1 ef seg. (2014). In particular, Defendants violated the anti-fraud
provisions of the Act in violation of Sections 4b(a)(2)(A)-(C), 4c(b), 40(1) and 6(c)(1), of the
Act, 7 U.S.C. §§ 6b(a)(2)(A)-(C), 6¢(b), 60(1) and 9(1) (2012), and Regulations 4.20(c),
5.2(b)(1)-(3), 33.10, and 180.1, 17 C.F.R. §§ 4.20(c), 5.2(b)(1)-(3), 33.10 and 180.1 (2014), and
by failing to register in various capacities, in violation of Sections 2(c)(2)(C)(iii)(I)(cc), 4k(2)
and 4m(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. §§ 2(c)(2)(C)(iii)()(cc), 6k(2) and 6m(1), and Regulations 3.12
and 5.3(a)(2)(i),(ii), 17 C.F.R. §§ 3.12, 5.3 (a)(2)(i), 5.3(a)(2)(ii) (2014).

5 Unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, Defendants are likely to continue to
engage in the acts and practices alleged in this Complaint or in similar acts and practices, as
described more fully below.

6. Accordingly, pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1 (2012), the
Commission brings this action to enjoin such acts and practices, prevent the dissipation of assets,
and compel compliance with the provisions of the Act. In addition, the Commission seeks civil
penalties, an accounting, restitution, disgorgement, rescission and such other statutory and

equitable relief as the Court may deem necessary or appropriate under the circumstances.

Ii. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

7 The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 6c(a) of the Act,
7 U.S.C. § 13a-1(a), which provides that, whenever it shall appear to the Commission that any
person has engaged in, is engaging in, or is about to engage in any act or practice that constitutes
a violation of any provision of the Act or any rule, regulation, or order promulgated thereunder,
the Commission may bring an action against such person to enjoin such practice or to enforce

compliance with the Act.
Case 2:15-cv-00237-SR@&;CM Document 3 Filed 04/14/15 akage 4 of 34 PagelD 13

8. Venue properly lies with this Court pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
§ 13a-1(e), because Defendants are found in, inhabit, or transact business in this District, or the

acts and practices in violation of the Act occurred, are occurring, or are about to occur within this

District.
Ill. PARTIES
9. The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“Commission” or

“CFTC”) is an independent federal regulatory agency charged by Congress with the
responsibility for administering and enforcing the provisions of the Act, 7 U.S.C. §§ 1 ef seg.
(2012) and the Commission’s Regulations promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. §§ 1.1 ef seq.
(2014).

10. Dorian A. Garcia, is 30 years-old, and resides in Naples, Florida. Garcia is the
managing member of DG Wealth, the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) of Macroquantum, the
managing member of UKUSA and the founder of a partnership called Quanttra LP (“Quanttra”),
a purported Delaware limited partnership located in New York City. Garcia does business
through the fictitious name “DG Wealth Management.” Garcia also conducts business under the
name “Commodity Projections” and is the administrator of a Commodity Projections website
that was created on August 4, 2011, www.commodityprojections.com. Commencing in
approximately April 2014, Garcia informally changed the name of DG Wealth to “PredSyst
LLC” and also had a website under that name at www.predsyst.com that is administered by
Garcia. Garcia was registered with the Commission as an associated person (“AP”) with
Macroquantum from December 9, 2011 until he withdrew that registration on November 14,

2013.
Case 2:15-Cv-00237-SReCM Document 3 Filed 04/14/15 Rage 5 of 34 PagelD 14

11. DG Wealth Management is a partnership registered in the state of Florida on
June 21, 2010. Its principal place of business is 999 Vanderbilt Beach Road, Suite 200, Naples,
Florida. Garcia registered the fictitious name “DG Wealth Management” with the state of
Florida on February 17, 2009. In April 2014, Garcia notified investors that its name was being
changed to PredSyst LLC. Later in 2014, Garcia formed Quanttra as a “successor” to DG
Wealth. Garcia is the managing member of DG Wealth, and a signatory on DG Wealth bank
accounts. Garcia also prepared and sent out email solicitations to prospective DG Wealth
investors, solicited and accepted funds from DG Wealth investors and controlled all aspects of
DG Wealth’s operations. DG Wealth has never been registered in any capacity with the
Commission.

12. Macroquantum Capital LLC is a Florida limited liability company that was
formed on November 9, 2011 as a hedge fund. Its principal place of business is 999 Vanderbilt
Beach Road, Suite 200, Naples, Florida, with a secondary office located at 1200 Brickell
Avenue, Suite 1950, Miami, Florida. Garcia is the CEO of Macroquantum, which has a website
administered by Garcia at http://macroquantum.com, Garcia was the sole signatory on
Macroquantum’s bank accounts, prepared and sent out email solicitations to prospective
Macroquantum clients, solicited and accepted funds from Macroquantum investors, and
controlled all aspects of Macroquantum’s operations. On December 9, 2011, Macroquantum
became registered as a commodity pool operator (“CPO”) and a forex firm until it withdrew
those registrations on December 14, 2013. Macroquantum was CPO and general partner of
UKUSA. Macroquantum is not currently registered in any capacity with the Commission. In
July 2013, Garcia opened a commodity trading account in the name of Macroquantum at a

registered Futures Commission Merchant (“FCM”), but the account was never funded.
Case 2:15-cv-00237-SRe.CM Document 3 Filed 04/14/15 agkage 6 of 34 PagelD 15

13. UKUSA Currency Fund LP is a partnership formed in Delaware on November
10, 2011. Its principal place of business is 999 Vanderbilt Beach Road, Suite 200, Naples,
Florida. Garcia is the managing member of UKUSA, which purports to be a commodity pool
that trades forex contracts for its pool participants. Garcia was the sole signatory on UKUSA’s
bank accounts, prepared and sent out email solicitations to prospective UKUSA investors and
controlled all aspects of UKUSA’s operations. UKUSA has never been registered in any
capacity with the Commission. Garcia, through DG Wealth, solicited investors to contribute
funds to UKUSA for a pooled investment in forex contracts. On information and belief, few, if
any, investors contributed funds to UKUSA and UKUSA never had accounts that traded forex at
any registered FCM.

IV. STATUTORY BACKGROUND

14. — Section 1a(10) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 1a(10) (2012), defines a commodity pool as

Case 2:15-cv-00237-SR\CM Document 3 Filed 04/14/15 aRage 7 of 34 PagelD 16

is not an eligible contract participant (“ECP”), as defined in Section 1a of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § la,
and that engages in retail forex transactions is defined as a CPO.

17. Section 2(c)(2)(C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 2(c)(2)(C) (2012), applies the anti-fraud
provisions of the Act and Regulations to agreements, contracts, or transactions in forex.

18. Pursuant to Section 2(c)(2)(C)(iii)(I)(cc) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.

connection with forex transactions.

19. Section 1a(18) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 1a(18) (2012), defines, in relevant part, an
ECP as a: (iv) a commodity pool that — (I) has total assets exceeding $5,000,000; ... or (xi) an

transaction in order to manage the risk associated with an asset owned or liability incurred, or

reasonably likely to be owned or incurred, by the individual.

Vv. FACTS
A. Overview of Garcia’s Operation and Trading Accounts

20. During the Relevant Period, Garcia operated at least six investment “firms” and
pitched at least eleven investment opportunities to potential investors. He operated all of his
investment “firms” out of the same virtual office space in Naples, Florida, and generally solicited
investors by email, word of mouth or at business or dinner meetings.

21. Garcia’s investment offerings included, among other things, participation in at
least one forex pool, commodity options investments, and the sale of purported partnership

interests and subscriptions to financial analytics tools.
Case 2:15-cv-00237-SR&«CM Document 3 Filed 04/14/15 akgage 8 of 34 PagelD 17

22. During the Relevant Period, Garcia opened a number of accounts for DG Wealth
in at least four national banks. Garcia also opened several bank accounts for Macroquantum and
UKUSA at one of those banks. Garcia transferred funds among and between the DG Wealth,
Macroquantum and UKUSA bank accounts frequently.

23. In May 2009 Garcia opened an account under the name of DG Wealth at a
registered FCM and forex firm, Forex Capital Markets LLC (“FXCM”), account number ending
#9484. Garcia had sole trading authority to trade this account and traded forex through this
account until approximately July 1, 2014. The account remained open with a balance of $239.93
from July 1, 2014 until it closed on October 20, 2014. The DG Wealth account at FXCM lost
approximately $157,661.51 over the life of the trading account and never had a balance
exceeding $160,775.72, which was on August 5, 2011.

24. On October 6, 2010, Garcia opened a brokerage account in the name of DG
Wealth at the securities brokerage E*TRADE, account ending #1482, by depositing $100,000 on
October 15, 2010. Additional deposits totaling $1,700 were made to the DG Wealth E*TRADE
account: $500 on October 11, 2011 and $1,200 on December 29, 2011, for a total of $101,700.
Withdrawals made from the E*TRADE account totaled $119,500, leaving a balance of only
$25.31 since October 2012.

25. Although Garcia may have begun soliciting private investors for DG Wealth as
early as March 2010, by at least May 2010, Garcia offered DG Wealth investment strategies that
included pooled investments in commodity options and forex contracts, among others, to at least
one investor (“pool participant”). Defendants pooled funds it accepted in bank accounts and
trading accounts under their ownership and control. However, Defendants used only a small

portion of the pooled investors’ funds to actually trade forex, futures or options.
Case 2:15-cv-00237-SiafexCM Document 3 Filed 04/14/15 wage 9 of 34 PagelD 18

26. During the Relevant Period, at least three DG Wealth pool participants did not
qualify as ECPs. Further, the commodity pools operated by DG Wealth and Macroquantum did
not qualify as ECPs, because none of those pools ever had total assets exceeding $5,000,000.

27. In May 2010, Garcia began to offer individual investors the opportunity to invest
in DG Wealth’s “private investment club.” He structured these investments as loans from
investors to DG Wealth by providing investors with promissory notes in order to make these
investments. These investor funds were pooled and used to invest in a variety of investment
“programs” or “strategies.”

28. Under each of its various strategies, DG Wealth would receive a fee which was a
predetermined percentage of the profits earned from the strategy.

29. DG Wealth offered an incentive fee to investors who could secure new investors
to join the offered investment pools.

30. | DG Wealth investments also included a “lockdown” period during which the
investor was prohibited from withdrawing his investment or suffer substantial penalties.

31. By 2013, Garcia was also seeking investors for a forex pool he called UKUSA
which was to be operated by Macroquantum and which has a website administered by Garcia at
http://macroquantum.com. Then, on March 27, 2014, Garcia or employees or agents under his
control launched yet another website, this one under the name www.predsyst.com, which offered
trading advice to investors. In April 2014, Garcia purportedly changed the name of “DG
Wealth” to “Predsyst LLC” and commenced communicating with DG Wealth investors about

their DG Wealth investments under the name PredSyst.
Case 2:15-cv-00237-SPfamCM Document 3 Filed 04/14/15 eage 10 of 34 PagelD 19

32. In October 2014, Garcia began soliciting DG Wealth investors to subscribe to DG
Wealth’s successor, Quanttra, in order to obtain forex trading research for use when trading their
own forex accounts. A website was set up at www.quanttra.com in September 2014.

B. Garcia’s Fraud

33. Garcia, who had no proven track record, began fabricating various bank and
trading account statements showing multi-million dollar account balances and profits that he
provided to prospective investors to entice them to invest in his pools or various investment
schemes.

34. Garcia knowingly or recklessly misled, and knowingly or recklessly continues to
mislead, prospective investors about the total amount of funds under management. For instance,
in May 2010, Garcia sent prospective investor PY wiring instructions for funding his investment
by remitting them to Garcia’s DG Wealth bank account ending #1838. He also sent PY a
statement for this bank account ending #1838 showing a balance of more than $2.7 million on
March 31, 2010. In fact, the account balance on that date was only $35,016.89.

35. Garcia also knowingly or recklessly misled, and knowingly or recklessly
continues to mislead, investors and prospective investors by telling them that their investments
would be protected by substantial cash funds in the DG Wealth E*TRADE account ending
#1482 while grossly exaggerating the funds on deposit in the E*TRADE account as further
described below.

36. Between November 2012 and September 2013, Garcia solicited prospective
investor MS with a barrage of emails offering a multitude of investment opportunities, including
but not limited to “the DG Wealth Aggressive Program”, and the UKUSA foreign currency fund,

both of which included forex trading. Garcia also sent MS a promissory note for MS to sign.
, Case 2:15-cv-00237-SRE*CM Document 3 Filed 04/14/15 (Page 11 of 34 PagelD 20

37. On September 30, 2013, prospective investor MS sent an email to Garcia asking
him to confirm whether the loan structure for making investments meant that they were not a
pooled investment and whether the loan was collateralized. Garcia replied by sending MS an
email on September 30, 2013 stating: “The investments are within a pool . . . and all programs
are protected by a $13 million cash reserve account held with E*TRADE.”

38. | To demonstrate the collateralization of the loan, on October 1, 2013, Garcia
emailed prospective investor MS a copy of DG Wealth’s E*TRADE # 1482 account statement
showing a balance of $13 million for the period from April 1 to June 30, 2013.

39. On February 23, 2013, Garcia sent prospective investor BY an email that
summarized eleven different programs, including at least one forex pool and a commodity
options program being offered by DG Wealth. Garcia’s summary emphasized that each of his
offered programs were “backed by an $8.7 million E*TRADE brokerage account.”

40.  Garcia’s representations to investors and prospective investors MS and BY as set
forth above were false and Garcia knew they were false. The sole existing DG Wealth
E*TRADE account was the one ending #1482, and from October 2012 forward, the E*TRADE
account only had an account balance of $25.31.

4l. Garcia knowingly or recklessly misled, and knowingly or recklessly continues to
mislead, investors and prospective investors by misrepresenting to investors that he did not have
to be registered to trade for their accounts because he had retained a licensed broker at a
registered securities brokerage firm whom Garcia said would actually place the trades for
customers’ accounts by following Garcia’s trading system. On information and belief, Garcia
never established any relationship with anyone at the securities brokerage firm he specifically

mentioned.
Case 2:15-cv-00237-SPféeCM Document 3 Filed 04/14/15 mage 12 of 34 PagelD 21

42.

Garcia knowingly or recklessly issued or caused to be issued false account

statements showing purported forex pool profits to investors and prospective investors by giving

investors and prospective investor’s copies of statements from DG Wealth’s FXCM forex trading

account ending #9484 with exaggerated account balances and reported profits.

43.

44,

For example, via email, Garcia sent:

Prospective investors, including BY and MS, a copy of a DG Wealth account
statement ending #9484 at FXCM dated October 26, 2012, that purported to show
an ending balance of $30,922,026.06;

Investors, including ZL, and prospective investors, including MS, a copy of the
DG Wealth account ending #9484 statement at FXCM that purported to show
profits of $896,605.37 for the period from May | — May 14, 2013 and an account
balance of $4,004,838.55;

Investors, including ZL, a copy of the DG Wealth account ending #9484
statement at FXCM for May 28, 2013, that purported to show an account balance
of $4,819,272.44; and

Prospective investor BY a copy of an FXCM account statement for DG Wealth’s
account ending #9484 for the period from March 27, 2014 to April 3, 2014 that
that purported to show a profit of $243,744.40 for the period with a current
account balance of $823,634.31.

In fact, Garcia’s claims about the account balances and earned profits in the DG

Wealth account ending #9484 as reflected in the statements he sent to investors and prospective

investors were entirely false. The DG Wealth account ending #9484 was the only FXCM account

held by DG Wealth and never had a balance higher than its balance on August 5, 2011 of

$160,775.75. Further, actual FXCM account statements show the following:

@)

(b)

©)

On October 26, 2012, at approximately 6:23 PM, the DG Wealth FXCM account
had an ending balance of $10,253.16;

For the period May 1, 2013 at approximately 5:00 PM through May 14, 2013 at
approximately 5:36 PM, the DG Wealth FXCM account showed a profit of
$930.67 with fees and an ending balance of $4,007.27;

On May 28, 20913 at approximately 1:09 PM, the DG Wealth FXCM account had
a balance of $4,819.44; and
Case 2:15-CV-00237-SFifixCM Document 3 Filed 04/14/15 Rage 13 of 34 PagelD 22
: i

(d) For the period from March 27 at approximately 5:00 PM through April 3, 2014 at
approximately 11:58 AM, the DG Wealth FXCM account showed a profit of
$234.40 and had an ending balance of $821.31.

45. Garcia knowingly or recklessly issued or caused to be issued false account

statements showing purported forex and commodity option pool profits to at least one investor
by emailing statements from DG Wealth with exaggerated account balances and reported profits.

46. For example, Garcia sent investor ZL the following three emails:

(a) anemail dated October 29, 2013 indicating that ZL’s $100,000 “Ultra-
Aggressive” [forex trading] account has a value of $155,000;

(b) — anemail dated November 23, 2013, indicating that ZL’s Options tier | [oil
options] investment of “$30,000, maturing 1.23.14, has a value of $39,000;” and

(c)  anemail dated April 5, 2014, stating that ZL’s oil [options] $125,000 investment
had a value of $212,500.

47. The account statements described above are false in that the Defendants only had
one forex account with an account balance of $8,250.08 on October 29, 2013. Further, none of
the Defendants had commodity options accounts at any registered FCM during the Relevant
Period where oil options would have been traded.

Cc Garcia Misappropriated Investor Funds

48. On information and belief, the Defendants received approximately $4.7 million
from approximately 80 investors, returned nearly $2.1 million to investors and misappropriated
at least $2.5 million of investor funds. Garcia used the misappropriated funds to pay for his
personal and business expenses and also made cash transfers to his personal bank accounts.

49. An illustration of Garcia’s misappropriation involves an investment made on
January 2, 2014, when ZL invested $125,000 with Garcia by sending a wire to DG Wealth’s

bank account number ending #3595, as had been directed by Garcia. This investment was for
Case 2:15-Cv-00237-SFféxCM Document 3 Filed 04/14/15 amage 14 of 34 PagelD 23

trading in oil options to be done by DG Wealth and was made pursuant to a promissory note that
was set to mature on April 1, 2014.

50. On April 5, 2014, Garcia sent ZL an email and confirmed for him that this
$125,000 investment in oil options had matured. However, Garcia said that he was unable to pay
ZL immediately the proceeds from this oil options investment.

51. | On April 29, 2014, Garcia sent an email to ZL stating that due to an investigation,
he was returning all capital to non-accredited investors and warned that some of the investments
“might not run to their maturities some might lose current value.”

52. In the following months, Garcia sent two statements to ZL purportedly showing
accounts that had funds on deposit for the repayment of investors. However, Garcia also sent
emails to ZL claiming that he could not make repayment due to an investigation by the Florida
Office of Financial Regulation (“FLOFR”) which had caused his bank accounts to be put on
“hold.”

53. Garcia told ZL that he was in the process of bringing back investor funds paid to
DG Wealth that he had sent to the Cayman Islands, but that as of August 6, 2014, the repayments
could be delayed by 3 to 6 months. He also told ZL on August 8, 2014, that “to continue to be
able to return funds,” Garcia needed to “prevent a deeper look at the firm from regulators.”

54, Garcia communicated with ZL on November 5, 2014, by telling him that in order
“to make sure that nothing happens that will prevent me from paying,” ZL should tell the
regulators, if subpoenaed, that the funds he lent to DG Wealth for trading accounts were for

“operating purposes not for trading.”
Case 2:15-cv-00237-SR@xCM Document3 Filed 04/14/15 age 15 of 34 PagelD 24

55. As of this date, Garcia has not made any payments to ZL to repay him for this
investment in oil options, and, on information and belief, Garcia misappropriated most, if not all,
of the $125,000 sum invested by ZL.

56. During the relevant time, funds from at least two investors were deposited into
Macroquantum’s bank account. On information and belief, those funds were never used for
trading and were misappropriated by Garcia for his own business and personal purposes.

D. DG Wealth and Macroquantum Commingled Pool Participant Funds

57. Garcia directed pool participants to wire their funds to DG Wealth bank accounts
and to a Macroquantum account to fund their investments. A portion of the pool participants’
funds were commingled with Garcia’s personal funds and business-related funds in and through
various bank accounts.

E. Macroquantum and DG Wealth Operated as CPOs of Forex and Non-Forex
Pools and Garcia Acted as an AP of CPOs without Benefit of Registration

58. During the relevant period, Macroquantum and DG Wealth acted as CPOs by
soliciting and accepting funds from individuals and pooling those funds for the purpose of
trading in pools of either commodity options or forex contracts.

59. Garcia represented to pool participants that his investment strategies included a
pool arrangement in which the funds of all investors in an investment strategy would be
combined together under a partnership arrangement with a limited number of pool participants in
individual strategies. Garcia used emails and other means or instrumentalities of interstate
