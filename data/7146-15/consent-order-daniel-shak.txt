CONSENT ORDER FOR PERMANENT INJUNCTION, CIVIL MONETARY
PENALTY AND OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF AGAINST DANIEL SHAK

1, INTRODUCTION

On September 30, 2014, Plaintiff U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission
(“Commission” or “CFTC”) filed a one-count Complaint (Dkt. No. 1) against Daniel Shak
(“Shak”) seeking civil monetary penalties, injunctive and other equitable relief for a violation of
the Commodity Exchange Act (“Act”), 7 U.S.C. §§ 1 et seq. (2012). Specifically, after
voluntarily consenting to an Administrative Order! (“CFTC Order’) issued by the CFTC in
November 2013 prohibiting him from engaging in certain commodity futures trading during the
daily closing period, six months later Shak violated the CFTC Order by trading two outright”
June 2014 gold futures contracts during the closing period on May 22, 2014 (“the Trade’’) - the
exact type of commodity futures trading that he agreed to be banned from trading. Shak now
consents to the entry of this order for permanent injunction, civil monetary penalty and other

equitable relief, which resolves this litigation between the parties in its entirety, as follows:

 

"In re Daniel Shak and SHK Management LLC, CFTC Docket No. 14-03, [2013-2014 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut.
L. Rep. (CCH) § 32,878 (CFTC Nov. 25, 2013)

13. Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an independent federal

regulatory agency that is charged by Congress with administering and enforcing the Act and the
Case 1:14-cv-01632-EGS Document9 Filed 03/27/15 Page 5 of 12

Commission’s Regulations (“Regulations”) promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. §§ 1.1 ef seq.
(2014).

14. Defendant Daniel Shak is an individual residing in Las Vegas, Nevada. Shak ts
registered with the Commission as a floor broker. Shak is a member of New York Mercantile
Exchange, a designated contract market.

2. Prior CFTC Order

15. On November 25, 2013, the Commission issued the CFTC Order instituting
administrative proceedings pursuant to Sections 6(c), 6(d), and 8a of the Act, 7 U.S.C. §§ 9. 13b,
and 12a(1) (2012), against Shak and SHK Management LLC, a registered commodity pool
operator (“CPO”) managed by Shak, and simultaneously accepted Shak’s Offer of Settlement.

16. As recited in the CFTC Order, in which the CFTC made findings of fact and
conclusions of law and imposed remedial sanctions, Shak and SHK Management LLC, his CPO,
attempted to manipulate the price of Light Sweet Crude Oil (“WTI”) futures contracts traded on
the New York Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”) on two trading days in 2008. In addition, the
CFTC Order found that Shak and his CPO violated the intraday spot month speculative position
limits for WTI futures contracts on those two trading days.

17. Shak, represented by counsel, neither admitted nor denied the allegations and
conclusions contained in the CFTC Order, and consented to the CFTC Order that required,
among other things. Shak to refrain from certain trading activity. Specifically, the CFTC Order
at Section V1.(4).(b). prohibited Shak:

For a period of two years, trading outrights, directly or indirectly, on or subject to the

rules of a registered entity, as registered entity is defined in Section la of the Act, as

amended by the CRA and the Dodd-Frank Act. to be codified at 7 U.S.C. § la, from the
beginning of the closing period for trading until the end of the closing period for any
commodity futures, options on commodity futures, commodity options, security futures

products, swaps, and/or foreign currency, or any other product or financial instrument

trades cxecuted between 1:29:00 to 1:30:00 p.m. eastern time are considered executed during the
closing period.

19, On Thursday, May 22, 2014, six months after issuance of the CFTC Order, Shak
bought two outright, June 2014 gold futures contracts at 1:29:14 seconds eastern time, 46
seconds before the close of the market. Thus, Shak’s trades occurred during the closing period in

violation of the CFTC Order. This was a one-time incident involving a 2-lot trade.

practice, or to enforce compliance with the Act, or any rule, regulation or order thereunder.
