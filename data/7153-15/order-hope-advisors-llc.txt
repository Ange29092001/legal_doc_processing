ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO SECTIONS 6(c) AND 6(d) OF
THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, MAKING FINDINGS

AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

 

I.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“Commission”) has reason to believe that
during the period March 2011 through January 23, 2013, Hope Advisors LLC (“HAL”) violated
Section 4m(1) of the Commodity Exchange Act, (“Act”), 7 U.S.C. § 6m(1) (2012). The
Commission also has reason to believe that during the period March 2011 through August 2013,
HAL violated Commission Regulation (“Regulation”) 4.22(d), 17 C.F.R. § 4.22(d) (2014).
Therefore, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest that public
administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted to determine whether the Respondent
engaged in the violations set forth herein and to determine whether any order should be issued
imposing remedial sanctions.

IT.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, the Respondent has
submitted an Offer of Settlement (“Offer”), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Without admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, Respondent consents to
the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 6(c) and 6(d) of the
Commodity Exchange Act, Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (“Order”) and
acknowledges service of this Order.'

 

' Respondent consents to the entry of this Order and to the use of these findings in this proceeding and in any other
proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party; provided, however, that Respondent
does not consent to the use of the Offer, or the findings or conclusions in this Order consented to in the Offer, as the
sole basis for any other proceeding brought by the Commission, other than in a proceeding in bankruptcy or to
enforce the terms of this Order. Nor does Respondent consent to the use of the Offer or this Order, or the findings or
conclusions in this Order consented to in the Offer, by any other party in any other proceeding.
Il.
The Commission finds the following:
A. SUMMARY

HAL operated Hope Investments LLC (“HIL”) as a commodity pool from March 2011
through January 23, 2013, without the benefit of registration as a commodity pool operator
(“CPO”), in violation of Section 4m(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 6m(1) (2012). Additionally, from
approximately March 2011 through August 2013, HAL provided monthly statements to HIL’s
pool participants that showed only realized gains and losses, in violation of Regulation 4.22(d).

B. RESPONDENTS

Hope Advisors LLC is located in Brentwood, TN, and has been registered as a CPO
since January 24, 2013. During the period March 2011 through January 23, 2013, HAL operated
HIL, a commodity pool, without the benefit of registration as a CPO. Karen S. Bruton
(“Bruton”) is President of HAL and is registered as its principal.

Cc. FACTS

HAL was formed in March 2011, and began operating HIL as a commodity pool at that
time. By January 2013, HIL had approximately 131 participants and a net asset value of over
$100 million. Although HAL and HIL were formed with the assistance of outside legal counsel,
neither HAL’s counsel nor its principal, Bruton, was aware of Section 4m(1)’s requirement that
HAL register as a CPO. In approximately August 2012, HAL’s retained counsel contacted the
National Futures Association (“NFA”) to determine whether HAL was required to register as a
CPO or was exempt from registration requirements. Subsequent to that communication, HAL
commenced the registration process and began drafting the required disclosure documents. HAL
became registered as a CPO and approved as an NFA member on January 24, 2013.

On March 25, 2013, the NFA commenced an audit of HAL. During the audit process,
NFA determined that HAL was providing monthly reporting statements to HIL participants that
showed only realized gains and losses, in violation of Regulation 4.22(d). In fact, HAL’s
monthly reporting statements were consistent with HAL’s disclosure statement and agreement
with pool participants, which provided that participants would only be allocated realized gains
and losses. HAL separately reported unrealized gains and losses to HIL participants in the form
of audited K-1 statements that included realized and unrealized gains and losses on an annual
basis.

After the NFA audit disclosed its reporting deficiencies, HAL took remedial action to
correct the monthly pool statements it sent to participants. In particular, HAL retained a
consultant, which designed a Rule 4.22 compliant performance report that HAL sends to
participants each month, and the consultant trained HAL’s staff on how to prepare the monthly
report and the performance disclosures contained in HIL’s disclosure document. HAL also
replaced its auditing firm and hired a certified public accountant as its chief financial officer.
As of August 2013, HAL began issuing two monthly reports to HIL participants, one
showing realized gains/losses which is the report consistent with the participants’ investment
terms, and a second based on net asset value showing realized and unrealized gains and losses,
which complies with Regulation 4.22(d). HAL also retained an audit firm to conduct an
independent monthly review of its performance reporting to ensure compliance with
Commission Regulations. The audit firm’s independent monthly review began in May 2013 and
will continue until May 2015.

LEGAL DISCUSSION

A. Respondent Violated Section 4m(1) of the Act

In 1974, Congress amended the Act to establish a more “comprehensive regulatory
structure to oversee the volatile and esoteric futures trading complex.” CFTC vy. Schor, 478 U.S.
833, 836 (1986) (quoting H.R.Rep. No. 93-975, p. 1 (1974)). “Registration is the kingpin in ...
[the Commission’s] statutory machinery, giving the Commission the information about
participants in commodity trading which it so vitally requires to carry out its other statutory
functions of monitoring and enforcing the Act.” Flaxman v. CFTC, 697 F.2d 782, 787 (7th Cir.
1983) (quoting CFTC vy. British American, 560 F.2d 135, 139-40 (2d Cir. 1977), cert. denied,
438 U.S. 905 (1978)). The registration requirements ensure that persons dealing in commodities
meet certain minimum financial and fitness requirements, and enable the CFTC to monitor the
trading activities of market members. Ping He (Hai Nam) Co. v. NonFerrous Metals (U.S.A.)
Inc., 22 F. Supp. 2d 94, 102-04 (S.D.N.Y. 1998) opinion vacated in part on reconsideration, 187
F.R.D. 121 (S.D.N.Y. 1999).

Section 4m(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 6m(1) (2012), makes it unlawful for a person to act
as a CPO and use the mails or any instrumentality of interstate commerce in connection with
one’s business as a CPO without being registered with the Commission as a CPO, subject to
certain exceptions and exemptions not applicable here.* The registration requirement does not
contain a “state of mind” limitation to liability. There is a “flat prohibition ... against using the
facilities of interstate commerce to give commodity advice unless registered,” and “[w]hile fraud
and misconduct may also be violations of the Act ... violations of § 6m alone are sufficient” to
warrant the granting of an injunction. British Am. Commodity Options, 560 F.2d at 142; accord
CFTC v, Wilson, 19 F.Supp.3d 352, 361 (D. Mass. 2014) (investment company failed to register

 

2 Under the Act, the Commission has statutory authority to exclude entities from the definition of “CPO,” thereby
relieving such exempted entities from the CFTC's registration requirements and attendant obligations. See 7 U.S.C.
§ 1a(11)(B) (‘The Commission, by rule or regulation, may include within, or exclude from, the term ‘commodity
pool operator’ any person engaged in a business that is of the nature of a commodity pool, investment trust,
syndicate, or similar form of enterprise if the Commission determines that the rule or regulation will effectuate the
purposes of this chapter.”). The Commission has exercised this authority over the years to expand and contract
exclusions in response to new information and changing circumstances. In connection with the registration of
CPOs, Commission Regulation 4.13(a)(1), 17 C.F.R. § 4.13(a)(1) exempts a CPO from registration if it does not
operate more than one commodity pool at a time, have more than 15 pool participants and the gross capital
contributions do not exceed $400,000. As noted above, HAL’s pool had more than 15 participants and its gross
capital contributions exceeded $400,000.
asa CPO). As set forth above, HAL operated HIL as a commodity pool from March 2011
through January 23, 2013, without the benefit of registration as a CPO, thus violating Section
4m(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 6m(1) (2012).

B. Respondent Violated Regulation 4.22(d)

Under the Act, CPOs are subject to regulatory requirements related to disclosure to
investors, see 17 C.F.R. §§ 4.21-4.22, 4.24-4.25, recordkeeping, id. § 4.23, segregation of
investor assets, id. § 4.20, and registration and reporting obligations. /nv. Co. Inst. v. CFTC, 891
F. Supp. 2d 162, 168-69 (D.D.C. 2012), as amended (Jan. 2, 2013), aff'd, 720 F.3d 370 (D.C.
Cir. 2013). The principal purpose of financial reporting required by Commission regulation
4,22(d) is to ensure that pool participants receive accurate, fair and timely information on the
overall trading performance and financial condition of the pool. As relevant here, Regulation
4,22(d) requires that commodity pool statements report both realized and unrealized gains and
losses. From approximately March 2011 through August 2013, HAL provided monthly
statements to HIL’s pool participants that showed only realized gains and losses, in violation of
Regulation 4.22(d).

V.

Respondent violated Section 4m(1) of the of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 6m(1)(2012) and Regulation
