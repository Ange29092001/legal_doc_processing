if you need something in particular in the libors i.e. you
have an interest in a high or a low fix let me know and
there's a high chance i'll be able to go in a different level.
just give me a shout the day before or send an email from
your blackberry first thing.

Thanks - our CP guys have been looking for it a bit higher - not a
big deal

if anything the cash has actually cheapened up since yesterday too
albeit by 1/2 tick - true could get some sub 75 days thru the next
week

COULD WE PLS HAVE A LOW 6MTH FIX TODAY
OLD BEAN?

Subject: “$ LIBORS: 83, 89, 96 and 11

LOWER MATE LOWER !!

will see what 1 can do but 1t’ll be tough as the cash 1s pretty well
bid

[Another U.S. Dollar Panel Bank] IS DOIN IT ON
PURPOSE BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE EXACT
OPPOSITE POSITION - ON WHICH THEY LOST 25MIO
SO FAR - LETS TAKE THEM ON!!

ok, let's see if we can hurt them a little bit more then

LIBOR HIGHER TOMORROW?

shouldn't be

COME ON. WE ALWAYS NEED HIGHER LIBORS !!!
HAHA

haha, i'll do my best fkcer

NO WORRIES. JUST CURIOUS, U SURVE THE

London MMD Manager: THX VM FOR CHECKING [Frankfurt Euro Desk Manager] -
YES WE WOULD PREFER A LOW FIXING AS WELL

[Frankfurt Regional Manager], I have a big favor to ask you.
‘Tell me.

And, uh ... a big, big, big favor.

Ok.

Bon. In Match ...

Yes.

We have, ch, we have 20 yards of a 6 month fixing. [...| A
lot inin March. So, basically, um, basically, uh, we need
high 6 month.

You need high 6 month, ok.

High 6 month, yes.

Sure, we will get high 6 month, no worries.

High.

We will get high 6 month.

Es... especially on the IMM, on the 19th I have 7 yards.

Just to let you know, it would suit me very much to have a
high LIBOR tomorrow. So, I don't know if you can put it high
or not or whatever it 1s, just to let you know, tomorrow it suits
me to have high 3s.

Umm. Yeh, there's one thing. We have to be careful. Usually
we quote below Euribor, and right now we usually quote
around 4 to 5 basis points below the expected Euribor just
to show that we are on the better quality of the range of the
contributors.

I see ...

So that's why, right now, if you look at our quote compared to
the other contributors ...

I know, I've been noticing that, that's why I thought I would
ask you if there is there any chance if you can put it up for
me. | would really appreciate that. Just for tomorrow, ok?

My coworker here says something, maybe 21 is possible.
