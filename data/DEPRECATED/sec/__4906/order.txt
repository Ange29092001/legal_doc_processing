FACTS

A. Background

7. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prohibits any company that issues securities
to the public from offering a bribe (1.e., cash or anything else of value) to a foreign _
offici alto persu ade-that official to-use-his influence to assist the company.in-obtaining or. ce a
retaining business. tn addition, the FCPA requires that public companies keep books and
records that accurately reflect their operations, and that they put in place internal controls
that are reasonably designed to ensure that their books and records are accurate.

-B. Sales to Government-Owned Steel Mills in China

8. From at least 1999 through 2004, defendant Wooh violated the anti-bribery

provisions of the FCPA by causing Schnitzer to pay approximately $205,000 in bribes to

3 COMPLAINT
managers of steel mills in China that were owned, in whole or part, by the Chinese
government. The purpose of the payments was to induce the managers to purchase scrap

metal from Schnitzer. Because the mills were at least partially government-owned, the

- managers were foreign officials within the meaning of the FCPA, and the payments were

improper.
9. Schnitzer paid two types of bribes, or kickbacks, to the managers. For the first
type, Schnitzer paid a âstandardâ kickback, which was generally $3,000 to $6,000 per

shipment. Schnitzer paid these kickbacks out of the revenue it earned on the scrap metal

_sale. For the second type, Schnitzer participated in a scheme in which the manager of a

steel mill would cause the steel mill to overpay Schnitzer for the steel purchase. The

- manager would then recover the âoverpaymentâ from Schnitzer, in amounts ranging from

$3,000 to $15;000 per shipment.

10. Wooh requested that Schnitzer wire the money for both types of kickbacks to
secret bank accounts in South Korea opened by another SSI employee specifically for
this purpose. Wooh and this employee would then use funds from the secret accounts to

make improper cash payments to managers of Schnitzerâs customers.. In addition to the

_ cash payments, Wooh and the employee gave gifts tothe-managers-of the. government-â .â.-.â_.-__-- __.

owned customers to induce the managers to purchase scrap metal from Schnitzer.

i. From at least 1999 through 2004, Wooh paid over $205,000 in bribes to
managers of Schnitzerâs government-owned customers in China in connection with 30
sales transactions. Schnitzerâs gross revenue for the transactions totaled approximately

$96 million, and Schnitzer earned approximately $6.3 million in net profits on the sales.

4 COMPLAINT
12. Based on the revenue that Schnitzer realized from the bribes to foreign
officials, described above, Wooh received bonus compensation of $14,819.38.
C. Sales to Privately-Owned Steel Mills in China and South Korea -

13. Also from at least 1999 through 2004, Wooh caused Schnitzer to pay
approximately $1.7 million in bribes to managers of privately-owned steel mills in China .
and South Korea. These mills were privately-owned and the managers were not foreign
officials. However, Schnitzer violated the FCPA by failing to properly account for and

_ disclose the bribes in its internal records and public filings.

14. In China, Schnitzer paid approximately $420,000 in such bribes, in
transactions that produced approximately $214 million in.gross revenue for the company.
In South Korea, Schnitzer paid approximately $1.3 million in such bribes, in transactions
that produced approximately $290 million in gross revenue. Wooh and another employee
also provided non-cash gifts to general managers of South Korean customers.

D. Schnitzerâs Investigation and Subsequent Events
15. In May 2004, Si Wooh disclosed to Schnitzerâs compliance department the

fact he made payments as described above. Based on this information, Schnitzer began

_____________to investigate the potential FCPA violations.Even after disclosing this practice to the coe

compliance department, Wooh made two additional payments to managers in South
. Korea; a senior Schnitzer executive authorized the payments in order to satisfy
outstanding agreements.

16. Around the same time as his discussions with Schnitzerâs compliance. |
department, Wooh authorized SSI employees.in South Korea to destroy documents

_ concerning the improper payments to foreign officials and general managers of private
