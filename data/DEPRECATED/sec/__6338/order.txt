vs.

GE INVISION, INC. (formerly known as INVISION
TECHNOLOGIES, INC.),

Defendant.

 

Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (âCommissionâ) alleges against defendant GE

InVision, Inc., formerly known as InVision Technologies, Inc. (âInVisionâ or âDefendantâ:
SUMMARY OF THE ACTION

1. This matter involves violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (âFCPAâ) by
InVision, a California-based manufacturer of explosive detection systems used at airports. In three
instances from at least June 2002 through June 2004, InVision was aware of a high probability that its
sales agents or distributors made or offered to make improper payments to foreign government officials
in China, the Philippines and Thailand, in order to obtain or retain business for InVision. Despite this,
InVision allowed the agents or distributors to proceed on InVisionâs behalf, in violations of the FCPA.
InVision also failed to devise and maintain a system of internal controls with respect to foreign sales

sufficient to assure compliance with the FCPA.

2. In a separate administrative proceeding relating to these violations, the Commission has
issued an order directing InVision to cease and desist from violating certain provisions of the FCPA and
disgorge the profits from its violations, $589,000, plus prejudgment interest of $28,703.57.

3. In this action, the Commission seeks a Court order requiring InVision to pay a civil
monetary penalty of $500,000 based on that same conduct.

JURISDICTION

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 21(d)(3) and 27 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ) [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78u(d)(3) and 78aa]. Defendant,
directly or indirectly, made use of the means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce and the
mails in connection with the acts, transactions, practices and courses of business alleged in this
Complaint.

5. Venue in this District is proper pursuant to. Section 27 of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C.
Â§ 78aa] because Defendant is located in the Northern District of California and a substantial portion
of the conduct alleged in this Complaint occurred within the Northern District of California.

INTRADISTRICT ASSIGNMENT

6. Assignment to the San Francisco Division is proper pursuant to Civil Local
Rule 3-2(c). Defendant maintains its headquarters in Alameda County, where a substantial part of the
events or omissions that give rise to the claims alleged in this Complaint occurred.

DEFENDANT

7. InVision designs and manufactures advanced explosive detection systems to scan
checked baggage by airport security personnel in the United States and other countries. At the time
of the conduct described below, InVision was incorporated in Delaware and headquartered in
Newark, California. InVisionâs common stock was registered with the Commission pursuant to
Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act and was listed on the NASDAQ National Market. InVision filed
reports with the Commission pursuant to Section 13 of the Exchange Act. On December 6, 2004,
InVision was acquired by an affiliate of General Electric Company (âGeneral Electricâ). The

Electric. All of the conduct described in this Complaint occurred prior to the acquisition of InVision
by General Electric.
FACTS

8. During the relevant period, InVision marketed and sold its explosive detection systems
to customers worldwide. To facilitate its sales outside the United States, InVision retained local sales
agents and distributors who were familiar with the business practices and customs of their respective
countries. The sales agents and distributors negotiated with InVisionâs customers, including
governmental aviation authorities, and typically reported to InVision through an InVision Regional
Sales Manager. The Regional Sales Managers reported directly to an InVision senior sales executive
(the âSenior Executiveâ).
A. Ching

9. In November 2002, InVision agreed to sell two explosive detection machines for use
at an airport under construction in Guangzhou, China. The airport is owned and controlled by the
government of China. The sale to the airport was conducted through InVisionâs local distributor in
China, which purchased the two machines from InVision for approximately $2.8 million. The
distributor, in turn, negotiated the sale of the machines and was InVisionâs primary representative to
the airport and associated governmental agencies.

10. Under the terms of the transaction, InVision was obligated to deliver the two machines
by mid-2003. Due to problems in obtaining an export license from the United States government,

however, InVision did not deliver the machines until October 2003. During the delay, the distributor

-in China informed the responsible Regional Sales Manager and the Senior Executive that the airport

intended to impose a financial penalty on InVision. The distributor advised the Regional Sales
Manager that, in order to avoid this penalty, it intended to offer foreign travel and other benefits to
airport officials. The Regional Sales Manager notified the Senior Executive of the distributorâs-
intention.

11. The distributor requested financial compensation from InVision to pay for penalties

and costs that, it claimed, would be incurred as a result of the delay in. shipment. The distributorâs

request included compensation for benefits that the distributor intended to offer to airport officials.

In October 2003, the Senior Executive agreed to pay the distributor $95,000. Based on information
provided by the Senior Executive and the Regional Sales Managet, InVisionâs finance department
subsequently authorized the payment, which was completed in April 2004. At the time of the
payment, based on the information provided to the Regional Sales Manager and the Senior Executive,
InVision was aware of a high probability that the distributor intended to use part of the funds it
received from InVision to pay for foreign travel and other benefits for airport officials.

12. InVision improperly recorded the payment in its books as a cost of goods sold.
InVision realized profits of approximately $589,000 from the sale of the two machines in China.

B. Philippines

13. InVision sold two explosive detection machines for use in an airport in the Philippines
in November 2001. Although InVision had retained a sales agent in the Philippines since at least
1996, the sale was made directly by InVision to the subcontractor responsible for building the airport
terminal baggage handling system.

14. Beginning at about the time of the November 2001 sale, InVision received repeated
requests for a commission on the sale from its sales agent in the Philippines. At the same time, in
communications with both the responsible Regional Sales Manager and the Senior Executive, the
agent indicated that it was negotiating for additional sales of InVision products to other airports
owned and controlled by the government of the Philippines. The agent indicated that it intended to
use part of any commission it obtained in connection with the November 2001 sale to make gifts or
pay cash to government officials in order to influence their decision to purchase additional InVision
products.

15. In December 2001, the Senior Executive agreed to pay the Filipino sales agent a
commission in the amount of approximately $108,000 in connection with the November 2001 sale.
Based on information provided by the Regional Sales Manager and Senior Executive, InVisionâs
finance department subsequently authorized the payment, which was completed in July 2002. At the

time of the payment, based on the information provided to the Regional Sales Manager and the

Senior Executive, InVision was aware of a high probability that the sales agent intended to use part of
the commission to make gifts or pay cash to influence Filipino government officials to purchase
InVision products. InVision improperly recorded the payment in its books as a sales commission.
The Filipino agent did not complete any additional sales on behalf of InVision.

Cc. Thailand

16. Beginning no later than 2002, InVision competed for the right to supply explosive
detection machines to an airport under construction in Bangkok, Thailand. Construction of the
airport is overseen by a corporation controlled by the government of Thailand. InVision retained a
distributor in Thailand to lobby the airport corporation and the Thai government on the Companyâs
behalf. Under the terms of the transaction, the distributor would purchase the explosives detection
machines from InVision and then make its profit by reselling them at a higher price for use by the
airport. The distributor was InVisionâs primary representative to the airport and associated
governmental agencies.

17. From at least January 2003 through April 2004, in communications with the
responsible Regional Sales Manager and the Senior Executive, the distributor indicated that it had
offered to make gifts or payments to officials with influence over the airport corporation. Based on
the information provided to the Regional Sales Manager and the Senior Executive, InVision was
aware of a high probability that the distributor intended to fund any such gifts or offers out of the
difference between the price the distributor paid InVision to acquire the machines and the price for
which the distributor was able to resell them: Despite this awareness, InVision authorized the
distributor to continue to pursue the transaction.

18..  Inor about April 2004, the airport corporation, through its general contractor, agreed
to purchase 26 of InVisionâs explosive detection machines from the InVision distributor in a sale
InVision valued at approximately $35.8 million. Consummation of the transaction was deferred after
InVision received notification of possible FCPA violations. inVision has not recognized any revenue
from the transaction and has agreed that the transaction will proceed, if at all, only as a sale directly

to the airport corporation or another Thai governmental entity.

D. InVisionâs Lack of Internal Controls

19. During the period of the foreign transactions described above, InVision failed to
develop an adequate process to select and train its sales agents and distributors employed outside the
United States. In choosing foreign sales agents and distributors, InVision primarily relied on
introductions by other American companies. InVision conducted little, if any, investigation into the
backgrounds of its foreign sales agents and distributors.

20. InVisionâs standard agreement with its foreign agents and distributors contained a
clause prohibiting violations of the FCPA. Beyond the contractual provision, however, InVision
provided no formal training or education to its employees (including its Regional Sales Managers) or
its sales agents and distributors regarding the requirements of the FCPA.

21.  InVision also failed to establish a program to monitor its foreign agents and
distributors for compliance with the FCPA. For example, InVision did not have a regular practice of
periodically updating background checks or other information regarding foreign agents and
distributors. With respect to the transactions described above, In Vision failed to establish an internal
system sufficient to prevent and detect violations of the FCPA.

FIRST CLAIM

violations of Section 30A of the Exchange Act
(illegal Offers and Payments)

22. Paragraphs 1 through 21 are re-alleged and incorporated by reference.

23. As described above, InVision made or authorized payments, through money and gifts,
to foreign officials for the purpose of influencing their official acts and decisions and inducing them
to use their influence to assist InVision in obtaining or retaining business with foreign airport
authorities. Throughout the relevant period, the recipients of these offers and payments were foreign
officials within the meaning of the FCPA, and the relevant foreign airport authorities were
instrumentalities of foreign governments within the meaning of the FCPA.

24. By reason of the foregoing, InVision violated the illegal offers and payments
provisions of the FCPA, codified as Section 30A of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78dd-1].

violations of Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act
(Books and Records)

25. Paragraphs 1 through 24 are re-alleged and incorporated by reference.

26. As described above, with respect to the offers and payments described above, InVision
failed to make and keep books, records and accounts which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflected its transactions and dispositions of its assets.

27.  Byreason of the foregoing, InVision violated the books-and-records provisions of the
FCPA, as codified at Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78m(b)(2)(A)].

THIRD CLAIM

violations of Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act
(internal Controls)

28. Paragraphs 1 through 27 are re-alleged and incorporated by reference.

29. As described above, with respect to the offers and payments described above, InVision
failed to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable
assurances that: (i) transactions were executed in accordance with managementâs general or specific
authorization; and (ii) transactions were recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles or any other criteria
applicable to such statements, and to maintain accountability for its assets.

30. By reason of the foregoing, In Vision violated the internal controls provisions of the

FCPA, as codified at Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78m(b)(2)(B)].
