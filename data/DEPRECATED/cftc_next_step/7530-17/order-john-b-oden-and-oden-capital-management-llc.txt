ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTION 6(c) AND 6(d) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, MAKING
FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL sanctions

I.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (““Commission’’) has reason to believe that
between April and November 2014, John B. Oden (“Oden”), while acting as the commodity pool
operator (“CPO”) for Oden Currency Fund, LP (“OCF”), violated Section 4m(1) of the
Commodity Exchange Act (the “Act’), 7 U.S.C. § 6m(1) (2012), and Commission Regulations
(“Regulations”) 4.13(a)(6), 4.13(c)(2), 4.20(c), 4.41(b), and 5.3(a)(2)G), 17 C.F.R. §§ 4.13(a)(6),
4.13(c)(2), 4.20(c), 4.41(b), and 5.3(a)(2)) (2016). In addition, the Commission has reason to
believe that between November 2014 and December 2015, Oden Capital Management, LLC
(“OCM”), while acting as the CPO for Oden Currency Fund I, LP (“OCF I’), violated
Regulations 4.7(b)(2), 4.22(h), and 4.41(b), 17 C.F.R. 8§ 4.7(b)(2), 4.22(h), and 4.41(b).
Further, because the Commission has reason to believe that Oden was the controlling person of
OCM, he is liable for OCM’s violations of the Regulations, pursuant to Section 13(b) of the Act,
7U.S.C. § 13c(b) (2012). Therefore, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public
interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted to determine
whether Oden and OCM (collectively, “Respondents”’) engaged in the violations set forth herein
and to determine whether any order should be issued imposing remedial sanctions.

Il.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Respondents have
submitted an Offer of Settlement (“Offer”), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Without admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, Respondents consent to
the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Section 6(c) and 6(d) of the
Commodity Exchange Act, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial sanctions (“Order”), and
acknowledge service of this Order.’

II.
The Commission finds the following:

A. SUMMARY

Oden, acting as a CPO, operated OCF as a commodity pool between April and November
2014. During April to June of 2014, Oden was not registered as a CPO and Oden claimed an
exemption from registration under Regulation 4.13(a)(2). Oden’s exemption claim, however,
was invalid. As a result, Oden should have been registered as a CPO during April to June 2014
(he later registered in July 2014) and his failure to do so violated Section 4m(1) of the Act and
Regulation 5.3(a)(2)q). During the broader time period when OCF operated (April-November
2014), Oden also committed the following violations of the Regulations: (1) he failed to provide a
required notice to prospective participants in OCF that he claimed an exemption from
registration as a CPO and failed to include a description of the criteria pursuant to which he
claimed such an exemption from registration; (11) he failed to promptly furnish to each OCF pool
participant a copy of monthly statements for the OCF pool that Oden received from the FCM and
such supplemental statements as would have been necessary to show the net profit or loss on all
commodity interests closed since the date of the previous statement; (411) he improperly
comingled OCF pool participant funds with his personal accounts, as well as accounts belonging
to family members; and (iv) he improperly utilized promotional materials that showed trading
returns based on hypothetical results without also including required disclosure language.

OCM, acting as a CPO, operated OCF I as a Regulation 4.7 exempt commodity pool
during the time period of November 2014 to December 2015. During this time period, OCM
committed the following violations of the Regulations: (1) OCM failed to send certain quarterly
reports to OCF I pool participants; (11) OCM failed to include the required oath or affirmation of
accuracy and completeness in the quarterly reports it did send to OCF I pool participants; and
(iit) OCM improperly utilized promotional materials that showed trading returns based on
hypothetical results, without also including required disclosure language.

Finally, Oden controlled OCM and, as a controlling person who knowingly induced the
underlying violations or failed to act in good faith, he is liable for OCM’s violations of the
Regulations pursuant to Section 13(b) of the Act.

 

! Respondents consent to the entry of this Order and to the use of these findings in this proceeding and in any

other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party; provided, however, that
Respondents do not consent to the use of the Offer, or the findings or conclusions in this Order consented to in the
Offer, as the sole basis for any other proceeding brought by the Commission, other than in a proceeding in
bankruptcy or to enforce the terms of this Order. Nor do Respondents consent to the use of the Offer or this Order,
or the findings or conclusions in this Order consented to in the Offer, by any other party in any other proceeding.
B. RESPONDENTS

John B. Oden is an individual that resides in Dallas, Texas. Oden was the CPO of OCF.
Oden was the chief compliance officer, sole owner, and a registered principal and associated
person of OCM from September 2014 until December 2015. Oden was also registered as a CPO
from July to November 2014.

Oden Capital Management, LLC is a Texas limited liability company located in Dallas,
Texas. Beginning in November 2014 and continuing until approximately December 2015, OCM
was the CPO of OCF I. OCM has been registered as a CPO since September 2014.

C. FACTS
1. John B. Oden: CPO of OCF

Oden, acting as a CPO, operated OCF from approximately April to November 2014.
OCF traded retail forex contracts on behalf of four participants. Oden wound down the affairs of
OCF in November 2014. During his tenure as CPO for OCF, Oden committed several violations
of the Act and Regulations, as set forth herein.

During the months of April to June 2014, Oden, acting as OCF’s CPO, was not registered
as a CPO (he registered as a CPO in July 2014). During this period, Oden claimed an exemption
from registration under Regulation 4.13(a)(2)°.

Eligibility for the exemptions claimed by Oden is subject to the requirement, set forth in
Regulation 4.13(a)(6), that the person operating the pool provide prospective pool participants
with a statement indicating that the person is exempt from registration and containing the basis
for the person’s claimed exemption from registration. Oden failed to provide this required
communication. Because of Oden’s noncompliance with 4.13(a)(6), he was not eligible for the
4.13 exemptions he claimed.

Also, under Regulation 4.13(c)(2), each person who has filed a notice of exemption from
registration under Regulation 4.13(a)(2) must promptly furnish to each participant in the pool a
copy of each monthly FCM statement for the pool and clearly show on that statement, or on an
accompanying supplemental statement, the net profit or loss on all commodity interests closed
since the date of the previous statement. Oden never sent any such statements to OCF pool
participants.

In addition, Oden provided at least one potential OCF pool participant with a “Hedge
Fund | Pager” and a PowerPoint presentation titled “Oden Currency Fund Presentation.” These
marketing materials claimed year-to-date investment returns of 18.9% and 19.0%, respectively.
Both of these purported investment returns were based, in whole or in part, on hypothetical

 

> Oden subsequently claimed exempt status under Regulation 4.13(a)(3) from August to March 2015. Only the first
exemption claimed by Oden is relevant here, because Oden registered as a CPO in July 2014.
trading. Both of these marketing materials failed to include a specific disclaimer explaining the
hypothetical nature of the results that was required pursuant to Regulation 4.41(b).

Finally, in May through July 2014, the funds of OCF pool participants were comingled
with bank and trading accounts titled in the name of OCF, John Oden, and David and Bonnie
Oden, in violations of Regulation 4.20.

2. Oden Capital Management, LLC: CPO of OCF I

OCM operated OCF I as a Regulation 4.7 exempt commodity pool from approximately
November 2014 until approximately December 2015. OCF I traded retail forex on behalf of 19
participants. OCF I wound down its affairs in December 2015, due to losses arising out of the
insolvency proceedings of a foreign forex trading firm, where its trading capital was held.
During its tenure as CPO for OCF I, OCM committed several violations of the Regulations, as
set forth herein.

As the CPO of a Regulation 4.7 exempt pool, OCM was required to issue statements to
pool participants (signed and affirmed in accordance with Regulation 4.22(h)) at least quarterly
and within 30 days of the close of the reporting period. Regulation 4.7(b)(2). During its brief
operation of OCF I, OCM did not always send the required quarterly statements to pool
participants. For those statements it did issue, OCM did not comply with the requirements of
Regulation 4.7(b)(2). Specifically, OCM did not include in its statements the net asset value of
the exempt pool or the change in net asset value from the end of the previous reporting period.
Finally, the quarterly statements OCM did send did not contain the oath or affirmation of
accuracy and completeness as required by Regulation 4.22(h).

OCM also utilized certain marketing materials in its solicitations with prospective and
actual OCF I pool participants. Among the materials OCM used were September and October
2014 OCF reports, which showed 39.4% and 42.7% year-to-date gross returns, respectively.
These reports combined hypothetical and actual trading results, without including the required
disclosure stated in Regulation 4.41(b). Similarly, a February 2015 “Investor Report Regarding
January 2015” combined actual and hypothetical trading results for January 2015 and showed
hypothetical returns over a ten-year period, both without including the required disclosure stated
in Regulation 4.41(b).

Oden was the chief compliance officer, principal, and sole owner of OCM. Among his
other duties, Oden was responsible for the content and issuance of OCF I’s quarterly statements
(or OCM’s failure to issue those statements in certain quarters) and was responsible for the
content of OCM’s marketing materials.
IV.
LEGAL DISCUSSION
A. Oden Violated Section 4m(1) of the Act and Regulation 5.3

In 1974, Congress amended the Act to establish a more “comprehensive regulatory structure
to oversee the volatile and esoteric futures trading complex.” CFTC v. Schor, 478 U.S. 833, 836
(1986) (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 93-975, p.1 (1974)). “Registration is the kingpin in ...[the
Commission’s] statutory machinery, giving the Commission the information about participants in
commodity trading which it so vitally requires to carry out its other statutory functions of monitoring
and enforcing the Act.” Flaxman v. CFTC, 697 F.2d 782, 787 (7th Cir. 1983) (quoting CFTC v.
British Am. Commodity Options, 560 F.2d 135, 139-40 (2d Cir. 1977)). The registration
requirements ensure that persons dealing in commodities meet certain minimum financial and fitness
requirements and enable the Commission to monitor the trading activities of market members. Ping
He (Hai Nam) Co. v. NonFerrous Metals (U.S.A.) Inc., 22 F.Supp.2d 94, 102-04 (S.D.N.Y. 1998)
opinion vacated in part on reconsideration, 187 F.R.D. 121 (S.D.N.Y. 1999).

Section 4m(1) of the Act makes it unlawful for a person to act as a CPO, and use the mails or
any instrumentality of interstate commerce in connection with one’s business as a CPO, without
being registered with the Commission as such, subject to certain exceptions and exemptions. The
registration requirement does not contain a “state of mind” limitation to liability. There is a “flat
prohibition ... against using the facilities of interstate commerce to give commodity advice unless
registered,” and “[w]hile fraud and misconduct may also be violations of the Act ... violations of §
6m alone are sufficient” to warrant the granting of an injunction. British Am. Commodity Options,
560 F.2d at 142; accord CFTC v. Wilson, 19 F. Supp. 3d 352, 361 (D. Mass. 2014) (involving
investment company that failed to register as a CPO).

As set forth above, Oden operated OCF as a commodity pool from approximately April to
November 2014. During April to June 2014, Oden was not registered as a CPO and was instead
relying on a Regulation 4.13(a)(2) exemption from registration beginning in April 2014. Oden
was ineligible for an exemption from registration because he failed to provide the
communications required under Regulation 4.13(a)(6) to prospective pool participants. See
Regulation 4.13(a)(6) (noting that eligibility for an exemption claimed under Regulation 4.13(a)(1),
(a)(2), (a)(3), or (a)(4) 1s “subject to” the CPO providing the required disclosure described therein).
As a result of the ineligibility of Oden for the exemption he claimed, Oden should have been
registered as a CPO during April to June of 2014. Section 4m(1) of the Act. Additionally, because
OCF traded retail forex contracts, Oden’s failure to register as a CPO also violated Regulation

5.3(a)(2)(i).
B. Oden Violated Regulation 4.13(a)(6)

Eligibility for a Regulation 4.13(a)(2) exemption is subject to the requirement that the
person operating the pool provide prospective pool participants:

(A) A statement that the person is exempt from registration with the Commission
as a commodity pool operator and that therefore, unlike a registered commodity
pool operator, it is not required to deliver a Disclosure Document and a certified
annual report to participants in the pool; and

(B) A description of the criteria pursuant to which it qualifies for such exemption
from registration.

Regulation 4.13(a)(6). Oden operated under a claimed Regulation 4.13(a)(2) exemption during
April to June 2014 (a period of time when Oden was not registered as a CPO). Oden failed to
provide this required written communication to prospective pool participants of OCF.
Accordingly, Oden violated Regulation 4.13(a)(6) by operating under a claimed Regulation
4.13(a)(2) exemption without meeting the eligibility conditions for that exemption.

C. Oden Violated Regulation 4.13(c)(2)

Pursuant to Regulation 4.13(c)(2), each person who has filed a notice of exemption from
registration under Regulation 4.13(a)(2) must promptly furnish to each participant in the pool a
copy of each monthly FCM statement for the pool and clearly show on that statement, or on a
supplemental statement, the net profit or loss on all commodity interests closed since the date of
the previous statement. Oden violated Regulation 4.13(c)(2) by failing to send any such
statements to OCF pool participants.

D. Oden Violated Regulation 4.20(c)

Regulation 4.20(c) prohibits a CPO from commingling the property of any pool it
operates with the property of any other person. During his operation of OCF, Oden violated
Regulation 4.20 by comingling OCF pool participant funds with his personal accounts, as well as
with accounts belonging to family members.

E. Oden Violated Regulation 4.41(b)

Regulation 4.41(b) requires the presentation of simulated or hypothetical performance
data by a CPO to be accompanied by a specific disclaimer set forth in Regulation 4.41(b)(1)(i) or
(i). During his operation of OCF, Oden violated Regulation 4.41(b) when he provided at least
one potential pool participant with a “Hedge Fund 1 Pager” and a PowerPoint presentation titled
“Oden Currency Fund Presentation” that showed year-to-date returns of 18.9% and 19.0%,
respectively. Both of these return figures were based, in whole or in part, on hypothetical trading
and both lacked the required disclosures regarding hypothetical trading results. By this conduct,
Oden violated Regulation 4.41(b). See CFTC v. Vartuli, 228 F.3d 94, 107 (2d Cir. 2000) (phrasing and
placement of disclosure violated Regulation 4.41(b)).

F. OCM Violated Regulation 4.7(b)(2)

A CPO operating a Regulation 4.7 exempt commodity pool may claim relief with respect
to certain periodic reporting requirements of Regulation 4.22(a) and (b), provided that it makes
certain disclosures in a statement, signed and affirmed in accordance with Regulation 4.22(h),
which is prepared and distributed to pool participants on a quarterly basis (within 30 calendar
days after the reporting period). Regulation 4.7(b)(2). This required quarterly statement “must
be presented and computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles” and
must indicate, among other things, such information as the net asset value of the exempt pool as
of the end of the reporting period, the change in net asset value from the end of the previous
reporting period, and the net asset value per outstanding unit of participation in the exempt pool
as of the end of the reporting period. Jd.

During its operation of OCF I, OCM did not consistently send these required quarterly
statements to the OCF I pool participants. In quarters where it failed to send the required
quarterly statements to pool participants, OCM violated Regulation 4.7(b)(2). Moreover, even
for those statements it did issue, OCM did not comply with the content requirements of
Regulation 4.7(b)(2). Specifically, OCM did not include in the OCF I quarterly statements the
net asset value of the exempt pool, the change in net asset value from the end of the previous
reporting period, or the net value of the participant’s interest in the exempt pool as of the end of
the reporting period. Accordingly, OCM violated Regulation 4.7(b)(2).

G. OCM Violated Regulation 4.22(h)

Pursuant to Regulation 4.22(h) each account statement and annual report provided by a
CPO pursuant to Regulation 4.7(b) must contain an oath or affirmation that, to the best of the
knowledge and belief of the individual making the oath or affirmation, the information contained
in the document is accurate and complete. In this case, the quarterly statements that OCM sent
to OCF I pool participants did not contain the required oath or affirmation of accuracy and
completeness. Accordingly, OCM violated Regulation 4.22(h).

H. OCM Violated Regulation 4.41(b)

As stated above, Regulation 4.41(b), requires the presentation of simulated or
hypothetical performance data by a CPO to be accompanied by a specific disclaimer set forth in
Regulation 4.41(b)(1)@) or (11). During its operations, OCM violated Regulation 4.41(b) when it
solicited OCF I pool participants with various written materials, including September and
October 2014 OCF reports, which showed 39.4% and 42.7% year-to-date gross returns,
respectively. These reports combined hypothetical and actual trading results, without including
the appropriate disclaimer regarding hypothetical results as required by Regulation 4.41(b).
Similarly, OCM’s “Investor Report Regarding January 2015” violated Regulation 4.41(b)
because it combined actual and hypothetical trading results for January 2015 and showed
hypothetical returns over a ten-year period, both without proper disclaimers under Regulation
4.41(b). By this conduct, OCM violated Regulation 4.41(b). See Vartuli, 228 F.3d at 107 (phrasing
and placement of disclosure violated Regulation 4.41(b)).

I. Oden’s Controlling-Person Liability

Oden controlled OCM and directly and knowingly induced OCM’s acts constituting
violations of the Regulations. Therefore, pursuant to Section 13(b) of the Act, Oden is liable for
OCM’s violations of the Regulations.

Section 13(b) of the Act provides that a person who, directly or indirectly, controls any
person who has violated any provision of the Act, or any rule, regulation or order issued pursuant
to the Act, may be held liable for such violations in any action brought by the Commission to the
same extent as such controlled person. A “fundamental purpose” of the statute is “to reach
behind the corporate entity to the controlling individuals of the corporation and to impose
liability for violations of the Act directly on such individuals as well as on the corporation itself.”
CFTC vy. R.J Fitzgerald & Co., 310 F.3d 1321, 1334 (11th Cir. 2002) (quoting JCC, Inc. v.
CFTC, 63 F.3d 1557, 1567 (11th Cir. 1995)).

To establish controlling-person liability under Section 13(b) of the Act, the Commission
must show that the defendant (1) directly or indirectly controlled the person or entity that
committed the violations; and (2) did not act in good faith or knowingly induced, directly or
indirectly, the acts constituting the violations. CFTC yv. Baragosh, 278 F.3d 319, 330 (4th Cir.
2002); R.J Fitzgerald, 310 F.3d at 1334; Monieson v. CFTC, 996 F.2d 852, 858 (7th Cir. 1993).
To establish the control element, a defendant must possess general control over the operation of
the entity principally liable. See, e.g., RJ. Fitzgerald, 310 F.3d at 1334 (recognizing an
individual who “exercised the ultimate choice-making power within the firm regarding its
business decisions” as a controlling person). Control is “the possession, direct or indirect, of the
power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person, whether
through the ownership of voting securities, by contract, or otherwise.” In re Spiegel, [1987-1990
Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) ¥ 24,103, n.4 (CFTC Jan. 12, 1988). The
Commission must also show that the defendant possessed specific control, which is “the power
or ability to control the specific transaction or activity upon which the primary violations was
predicated, even if such power was not exercised.” CFTC v. Int'l Fin. Services, Inc., 323 F.
Supp. 2d 482, 504 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) (quoting Baragosh, 278 F.3d at 330).

Oden was the chief compliance officer, sole owner, and a registered principal and
associated person of OCM. As such, Oden had the requisite general control of OCM. In re
Spiegel, [1987-1990 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) ¥ 24,103, at 34,767 (CFTC
Jan. 12, 1988); see also In re Apache Trading Corp., [1990-1992 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut.
L. Rep. (CCH) ¥ 25,251, at 38,795 (CFTC Mar. 11, 1992) (finding that an individual controls a
corporation where he “directs the economic aspects of the firm’). In addition, Oden was
responsible for the content and issuance of OCF I’s quarterly statements (or OCM’s failure to
issue those statements in certain quarters) and was responsible for the content of OCM’s
marketing materials. Oden therefore possessed the specific control over the activities upon
which OCM’s violations of Regulations 4.7(b)(2), 4.22(h), and 4.41(b) are predicated.

To establish the “knowing inducement” element of the controlling-person violations, the
Commission must show that “the controlling person had actual or constructive knowledge of the
core activities that constitute the violations at issue and allowed them to continue.” JCC, Inc. v.
CFTC, 63 F.3d 1557, 1568 (11th Cir. 1995) (quoting In re Spiegel, [1987-1990 Transfer Binder]
Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) J 24,103, at 34,767 (CFTC Jan. 12, 1988)). In this case, Oden was
directly responsible for the issuance of OCF I quarterly statements (as well as failing to issue
those statements, at times), including the contents of those statements. Moreover, Oden was
directly responsible for the solicitation materials utilized by OCM, including those materials that
contained hypothetical trading results without presenting the required disclaimer under
Regulation 4.41(b). Further, Oden knew that the trading results touted in OCM’s marketing
materials were hypothetical and knew that no disclaimer accompanied those results.
Accordingly, Oden knowingly induced, directly or indirectly, the conduct that constitutes OCM’s
violations of the Regulations. Consequently, pursuant to Section 13(b) of the Act, he is liable for
OCM’s violations of the Regulations.

V.

FINDINGS OF violations

Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds: that Oden violated Section 4m(1) of the
Act, Regulations 4.13(a)(6), 4.13(c)(2), 4.20(c), 4.41(b), and 5.3(a)(2)G); that OCM violated
Regulations 4.7(b)(2), 4.22(h), and 4.41(b); and that Oden is liable for OCM’s violations of the
Regulations pursuant to Section 13(b) of the Act.
