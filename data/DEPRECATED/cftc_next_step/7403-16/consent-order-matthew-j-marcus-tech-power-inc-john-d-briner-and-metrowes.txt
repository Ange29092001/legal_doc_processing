§§ 1-26 (2012), and the Commission's Regulations (“Regulations”) promulgated thereunder,

17 C.F.R. §§ 1.1190.10 (2015). (Doc. 1). In particular, the Commission’s Complaint alleged
that from January 28, 2014 through February 5, 2014 (“relevant period”) Defendants engaged tn
624 round-tum trades involving 1,248 perfectly matched, pre-arranged, non-competitive

Case: 1:15-cv-03307 Document #: 67-1 Filed: 06/28/16 Page 3 of 19 PagelD #:544

Commission's Complaint further alleges that by structuring the transactions such that Tech
Power would buy at lower prices and sell at higher prices opposite MetroWest, Defendants were
able to ensure Tech Power would always profit from the transactions, cnabling the Defendants to
conduct a “money pass” between the two accounts, By virtue of this conduct, the Complaint
alleged that Defendants violated Section 4c(aX2){(AX(ii) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 6c(a{2)(A)ii)
(2012), by entering into transactions that are fictitious sales involving the purchase or sale of
commodities for future delivery and Regulation 1.38(a), 17.C.F.R. § 1.38(a}(2015), by entering
into illegal, non-competitive transactions to buy and sell futures contracts.

On April 16, 2015, this Coust entered an Ex Parte Statutory Restraining Order and Asset
Freeze against all Defendants and thereafter, extended the statutory restraining order to May 12,
2015. (Docs. 15,21). On May 7, 2015, this Coust entered a Consent Order for Preliminary
Injunction and continued the asset freeze, against Defendants Marcus, Tech Power and Briner.
(Docs. 26, 27, 28). On the same day, this Court entered an Order for Preliminary Injunction and
Other Ancillary Relief against Defendant MetroWest. (Doc. 29).

On June 10, 2015, this Court entered an order striking Answers filed by Briner and
MetroWest (Doc. 37). On July 7, 2015, the CFTC filed a Renewed Motion for Emtry of a
Default against Briner and MetroWest (Doc. 40), which was granted on July 9, 2015 (Doc. 43).

THE COURT HEREBY FINDS:
A. ‘Findings of Fact

The Parties to This Consent Order

1S. The Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an independent federal
regulatory agency charged by Congress with the responsibility for administering and enforcing
the provisions of the Act, 7 U.S.C. §§ 1 ef seg. (2012), and the Commission's Regulations
promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. §§ 1.1 ef seq. (2015), -

16. Matthew J. Marcus resides in California and is the sole principal of Tech Power, a
California ecommerce and web development company. Marcus serves as Tech Power's
President, Secretary, Treasurer and Director, and acted as, and held himself out to the public as,
Tech Power's controiling person. Marcus has never been registered with the Commission in any
capacity.

17. Tech Power, an ecommerce and web development company, was incorporated in
Nevada on July 17, 2002, and ceased operations in February 2014. It has never been registered
with the Conunission in any capacity.

| Defendants’ Trading Accounts

18. In June 2012, Defendant Briner opened a commodity trading account, ending in
nos, 7543 (“MetroWest 7543"), at a registered futures commission merchant ("FCM") in the
name of his law firm, MetroWest. Briner had a unique user name and password that allowed
him to contro! trading within MetroWest 7543.

19. In connection with opening the MetroWest 7543 account, Briner signed the

FCM’s customer agreement on June 11, 2012, affirming that he would be responsible for all
orders entered using his user name and password. Briner also represented that he would not

Case: 1:15-cv-03307 Document #: 67-1 Filed: 06/28/16 Page 8 of 19 PagelD #:549

permit any other person to have acccss to the MetroWest 7543 eccount for any purpose, unless
specified to the FCM and agreed fo by the FCM.

20. _ A total of $500,000 was wired from MetroWest’s client trust account and
eposited into MetroWest 7543 during 2012. Prior to the funding of MetroWest 7543 at the
registered FCM, Marcus, a client of Briner and MetroWest, caused approximately $1.2 million to
be transferred to Metro West's client trust account.

2t. On January 25, 2013, Mescus opencd a trading account in the name of Tech
Power, ending in nos, 0$60 (“Tech Power 0560"), with the same registered FCM. On the
account opening documents, Marcus stated that he was the only authorized trader for the Tech
Power account. Mascus had a unique ID and password that allowed him to control trading
within Tech Power 0560. |

22. = Inconnection with opening the Tech Power 0560 account, Marcus signed the
FCM's customer agreement on January 25, 2013, affirming that he would be responsiblo for all
ordera entered using his user name and password. Marcus also represented that he would not
permil any other person to have access to the Tech Power 0560 accoumt for any purpose, unless

specified to the FCM and agreed (0 by the FCM. Marous funded the Tech Power account with
an initial $100,000 deposit on January 30, 2013.

Defendants’ Single Steck Futures Trading Scheme
23. At some point after opening the MetroWest account, Briner provided Marcus with
his unique password and login information, and informally authorized Marcus to enter trades for

the MetroWest 7543 account, Prior to January 28, 2014, neither MetroWest 7543 nor Tech
Power 0560 had ever placed trades on OneChicago.

 

. aren
Case: 1:15-cv-03307 Document #: 69 Filed: 06/30/16 Page 9 of 19 PagelD #:571
Case: 1:15-cv-03307 Document #: 67-1 Filed: 06/28/16 Page 9 of 19 PagelD #:550

25. Beginning on January 28, 2014 and continuing for seven consecutive wading
dates through February 5, 2014, Marcus carried out a scheme whereby he moved money from
MetroWest to Tech Power through a series of pre-arranged, non-competitive transactions using
SSF contracts on OneChicago, commonly known es a “money pass.”

26,  Inecach of those transactions, Marcus placed a limit order to buy a specific
quantity of SSF for a speciftc price for one of the accounts. Following that ordes, Marcus
entered the market with a limit order to sell the exact same quantity of SSF at an identical price
for the other account. After the orders were matched in one transaction, Marcus later entered
into an equal end offsetting transaction to close out the position. The result was ro net change in
open positions held by cither MctroWest or Tech Power, but a profit to Tech Power and a loss to
MetroWest. This trading pattern was repeated hundreds of times throughout the relevant period.

27. For example, on January 28, 2014, Marcus entered a limit order to buy one Jot of
MYGNID (March expiry) at 12:46:19 pm at a price of $24,97 for Tech Power. At 12:46:29 pm,
Marcus entered a limit order to sell one lot of MYGNID (March expiry) at a price of $24.97 for
MetroWest 7543. The orders were matched, and the trade was executed at 12:46:29 pm. The
accounts reversed positions 36 minutes later. At 1:22:3] pm, Marcus entered a limit order to sell
one lot of MYGNID (March expiry) at a price of $25.42 for Tech Power 0560, and at |:22:39,
he entered a limit order to buy one lot of MYGNID (March expiry) at a price of $25.42 for
MetroWest 7543. The orders were matched, and the trade was executed at 1:22:39 pm. In this
transaction, Tech Power 0560 gained $45.00.

28. Using this methodology, Marcus traded the MetroWest 7543 account and the

Tech Power 0560 eccount almost exclusively sgainst each other on OneChicago. He was able to
. do this, in part, by placing nearly simultaneous, matching orders and wading in eight illiquid SSF
Case: 1:15-cv-03307 Document #: 69 Filed: 06/30/16 Page 10 of 19 PagelD #:572
Case: 1:15-cv-03307 Document #: 67-1 Filed: 06/28/16 Page 10 of 19 PagelD #:551

products, which virtually eliminated the possibility of wading with a different counterparty.
During the relevant period, these transactions constituted approximately 98 percent of all trades
in eight SSF products. The MetroWest 7543 account exoveled a total of 1,248 SSF trades
opposite the Tech Power 0560 account on OneChicago. In the vast majority of instances where
Marcus closed out a position, it resulted in a loss to MetroWest 7543 and a gain to Tech Power
0560. As a result, MetroWest transferred $390,000 to Tech Power.

29. By knowingly and intentionally executing trades for the Tech Power account
opposite the MetroWest account in contracts with low liquidity, Marcus entered into transactions
without an intent to mke a bona fide position in the market.

30. The foregoing trading ectivity did not comply with OneChicago’s written rules
and generated compliance alerts at OneChicago. On February 7, 2014, OneChicago requested
that the FCM freeze the MetroWest 7543 and Tech Power 0560 trading accounts.

B. Conctusions of Law

sales of commodity futures contracts be executed “openly and competitively.” |

37. Marcus controlled Tech Power, directly or indircetly, and did not act in good faith
or knowingly induced, directly or indirectly, the acts constituting Tech Power's violations;
