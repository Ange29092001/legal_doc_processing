THE PARTIES AGREE AND THE COURT HEREBY FINDS:

A. Findings of Fact

14, Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an independent federal

regulatory agency that is charged by Congress with administering and enforcing the Act, 7
Case 1:15-cv-03497-JPO Document 35 Filed 03/31/16 Page 5 of 19

U.S.C. §§ 1-26 (2012), and the Regulations promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. §§ 1.1 — 190.10
(2014).

15. Defendant Heet Khara is an individual who resides in the United Arab Emirates.
Defendant Khara transacted business in New York by entering orders or causing orders to be
entered on the Commodity Exchange, Inc. (“COMEX”), a futures exchange located in New
York, New York. Defendant Khara has never been registered with the Commission.

16. Defendant Nasim Salim is an individual who resides in the United Arab
Emirates. Defendant Salim transacted business in New York by entering orders or causing
orders to be entered on COMEX, a futures exchange located in New York, New York.
Defendant Salim has never been registered with the Commission.

Defendants’ Trading Accounts

17, Between January 29, 2015 and March 13, 2015, Defendant Khara held an account
to trade futures with a futures commission merchant. Defendant Khara was introduced to the
futures commission merchant through introducing broker Zonyx DMCC (“‘Zonyx”), whose head
and authorized trader is Defendant Salim. Zonyx has never been registered with the
Commission.

18. In February 2015, CME Group’s Market Regulation Department identified certain
trading practices in Defendant Khara’s account, and advised Defendants Khara and Salim by
email that Market Regulation had concerns that Defendant Khara may be engaged in disruptive
trading known as spoofing.

19. CME Group also advised the futures commission merchant, which suspended
Defendant Khara’s electronic trading access. Defendant Khara withdrew all of the funds in the
account and then opened an account with a second futures commission merchant in March of

2015.
Case 1:15-cv-03497-JPO Document 35 Filed 03/31/16 Page 6 of 19

20. Defendant Salim, through an account he opened in the name of Zonyx DMCC,
traded futures contracts through the same futures commission merchant where Khara opened his
second account. Defendant Salim owned and controlled Zonyx DMCC, and opened the Zonyx
account with the futures commission merchant in 2008.

Defendants’ Disruptive Trading Activity: Spoofing

21. From at least February 2015 through April 28, 2015 (the “Relevant Period”),
Defendants Heet Khara and Nasim Salim engaged in unlawful disruptive trading practices or
conduct in the gold and silver futures markets on or subject to the rules of a registered entity,
COMEX, that were, were of the character of, or were commonly known to the trade as
“spoofing” (bidding or offering with the intent to cancel the bid or offer before execution).

22; Between February 2015 and April 28, 2015, Defendant Heet Khara entered orders
for Gold and Silver contracts on COMEX, which he did not intend to execute, and thereby
engaged in disruptive trading activity, known as spoofing. Defendant Khara engaged in such
spoofing by, among other means, entering several layered orders on one side of the market with
an intent to cancel the orders before execution. At the time Khara placed the layered orders, he
had one or more smaller orders on the opposite side of the market in order to profit from his
spoofing conduct.

23. For example, on February 20, 2015, Defendant Khara traded April 2015 Gold
futures contracts on CME Globex in the following manner: From 01:17:44,826 a.m. Central
Standard Time, Defendant Khara entered two offers in the Gold futures contract at a price of
12081. Approximately one second later, at 01:17:46.050, Khara entered a series of 2-lot bids.
Specifically, between 01:17:46.050 and 01:17:48.434, Khara entered fifteen 2-lot bids in

increasing price starting from 12076 through 12079, Defendant Khara intended to cancel these
Case 1:15-cv-03497-JPO Document 35 Filed 03/31/16 Page 7 of 19

bids when he entered them. Within milliseconds of Khara’s last 2-lot bid at a price of 12079,
Khara’s offer traded at a price of 12081. Within milliseconds of the offer trading, Khara entered
four additional 2 lot bids, for a total buy side exposure of thirty-eight contracts. Approximately a
second later, Khara cancelled all thirty-eight bids.

24. Between February 2015 and April 28, 2015, Defendant Salim entered orders for
Gold and Silver contracts on COMEX, which he intended to cancel before they were executed,
and thereby engaged in disruptive trading activity known as spoofing. Defendant Salim engaged
in such spoofing by, among other means, entering several layered orders on one side of the
market with an intent to cancel the orders before execution. At the time Salim placed the layered
orders, he had one or more smaller orders on the opposite side of the market in order to profit
from his spoofing.

25, For example, on April 24, 2015, Defendant Salim traded May 2015 Silver futures
contracts on CME Globex, in the Zonyx account he controlled, in the following manner: At
5:02:12.175 a.m. Central Standard Time, Salim entered a 5-lot bid at a price of 15805, Starting
approximately five seconds later, Salim entered eight 5-lot offers at a price of 15810. Salim
intended to cancel the offers when he entered them. Within milliseconds of Salim entering his
eighth 5-lot offer, his bid traded. Within milliseconds, Salim entered three additional 5-lot offers
at a price of 15810, for a total sell side exposure of 55 contracts. Approximately one second
after his bid traded, he cancelled the offers to sell all 55 contracts.

26. During the Relevant Period, Defendants Khara and Salim willfully engaged in a
coordinated effort while acting for and in concert with each other to engage in the disruptive

trading practice of spoofing.
Case 1:15-cv-03497-JPO Document 35 Filed 03/31/16 Page 8 of 19

27. For example, on April 17, 2015, Defendants Khara and Salim traded June 2015
Gold futures contracts on CME Globex in the following manner: At 1:13:33:376 a.m. Central
Standard Time, Defendant Salim placed two 4-lot offers at a price of 12005 in the Zonyx
account. Between 1:13:35:434 and 1:13:37:038 a.m. Central Standard Time, Defendant Khara
entered five 5-lot bids at a price of 12003 and then three 5-lot bids at a price of 12004 in Khara’s
account. Defendant Khara intended to cancel these bids when he entered them. Within
milliseconds of Khara entering his last 5-lot bids at a price of 12004, Salim’s 4-lot offers traded
at a price of 12005. Salim and Khara continued this pattern of small offers in the Zonyx account
and layered bids in Khara’s account for approximately 15 seconds. Within the 15 second period,
all of Salim’s offers in the Zonyx account traded. Within a second of Salim’s last offer trading,
Khara cancelled all of his bids.

32. Defendant Khara engaged in the foregoing conduct while he was an agent or other
person “acting for” Defendant Salim within the scope of Defendant Khara’s employment, office, or
agency with Defendant Salim; therefore, pursuant to Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. §

34. Defendant Khara willfully aided, abetted, counseled and worked in combination

Salim’s violations of Section 4c(a)(5)(C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 6c(a)(5)(C).

Khara’s violations of Section 4c(a)(5)(C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 6c(a)(5)(C).
