Plaintiff, Commodity Futures Trading Commission (““Commission” or “CFTC"), by its

attorneys, alleges as follows:
I. SUMMARY

l. From at least April 2017 through at least February 2019 (“Relevant Period”),
Winston Reed Investments LLC (“WRI”), by and through its principal, Mark N. Pyatt a/k/a
Daniel Randolph (“Pyatt’”) (collectively, Defendants”), and Pyatt directly, fraudulently solicited
and received at least approximately $200,000 from at least nineteen individuals (“pool
participants”), who are not eligible contract participants (“ECPs”), as defined in Section 1a(18)
of the Commodity Exchange Act (“Act” or “CEA”), 7 U.S.C. § 1a(18) (2018). Defendants
solicited and received these funds in connection with pooled trades in commodity futures
contracts (“futures”) and retail foreign exchange transactions (“forex”), among other things. In
doing so, Defendants misappropriated most of pool participants’ funds for business expenses and
personal use, and to make Ponzi-like payments to other pool participants. Defendants also made

false and misleading representations to pool participants and issued false reports that
misrepresented trading profits purportedly achieved by Defendants on behalf of pool
participants.

2. By virtue of this conduct, and the further conduct described herein, Defendants
have violated the following provisions of the Act and the Commission Regulations
(“Regulations”) promulgated thereunder: Sections 4b(a)(1)(A)-(C), 4b(a)(2)(A)-(C), and
40(1)(A) and (B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. §§ 6b(a)(1)(A)-(C), 6b(a)(2)(A)-(C), 60(1)(A), (B) (2018);
and Regulation 5.2(b)(1)-(3), 17 C.F.R.§ 5.2(b)(1)-(3) (2019).

3. Unless restrained or enjoined by this Court, Defendants will likely continue to
engage in the acts and practices alleged in this Complaint, or in similar acts or practices, as
described more fully below.

4. Accordingly, pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1 (2018), the
CFTC brings this action to enjoin Defendants’ unlawful acts and practices, to compel their
compliance with the Act and Commission Regulations, and to enjoin them from engaging in any
commodity or forex related activities. In addition, the CFTC seeks civil monetary penalties,
restitution, and remedial ancillary relief, including, but not limited to, trading and registration
bans, disgorgement, pre- and post-judgment interest, and such other and further relief as the
Court may deem necessary and appropriate.

II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

5. This Court has jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (2012)
(federal question jurisdiction) and 28 U.S.C. § 1345 (2012) (district courts have original
jurisdiction over civil actions commenced by the United States or by any agency expressly
authorized to sue by Act of Congress). Sections 2(c)(2)(C) and 6c(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.

§§ 2(c)(2)(C) and13a-I(a) (2018), authorizes the Commission to seek injunctive relief against
any person whenever it shall appear that such person has engaged, is engaging, or is about to
engage in any act or practice that violates any provision of the Act or any rule, regulation, or
order promulgated thereunder.

6. Venue properly lies with this Court pursuant to 7 U.S.C. § 13a-l(a) because
Defendants are found in, inhabit, or transact business in this District, or the acts and practices in
violations of the Act and Regulations occurred, or are occurring, or are about to occur within this
District, among other places.

Ill. THE PARTIES

7. Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an independent federal
regulatory agency charged by Congress with responsibility for administering and enforcing the
provisions of the Act, 7 U.S.C. §§ 1-26 (2018), and the Regulations promulgated thereunder, 17
C.F.R. pts. 1-190 (2019).

8. Defendant Winston Reed Investments LLC is a limited liability company
formed in April 2017 and organized under the laws of North Dakota. Its principal place of
business is in Williston, North Dakota. WRI has never been registered with the CFTC in any
capacity.

9. Defendant Mark Nicholas Pyatt a/k/a Daniel Randolph is a natural person who
currently resides in North Dakota. During a portion of the Relevant Period, he resided in
Waynesville, North Carolina. He serves as the vice president and investment consultant for, and
held a power of attorney on behalf of, WRI. Pyatt has never been registered with the CFTC in

any capacity.
IV. FACTS
A. The Purpose and Organization of WRI

10. Pyatt established WRI to facilitate his trading of various financial instruments,
including futures and forex.

11. Pyatt, on behalf of WRI, solicited prospective pool participants to trade futures
and forex through the WRI pool. In more than one solicitation, Pyatt identified himself as
“Daniel Randolph” when speaking with prospective pool participants. When prospective pool
participants agreed to deposit funds into the WRI pool, Pyatt had the prospective pool
participants sign an agreement with WRI. That agreement identified “Daniel Randolph” as
WRI’s President and Pyatt as its “Vice President, Investment Consultant and POA.” Pyatt
controlled WRI’s day-to-day operations and was responsible for, among other things, trading
pool participants’ funds.

12. During the Relevant Period, WRI was a CPO as defined in Section 1(a)(11) of the
Act, 7 U.S.C. § 1(a)(11) (2018), because WRI engaged in a business that is of the nature of a
commodity pool, an investment trust, syndicate, or similar form of enterprise operated for the
purpose of trading in commodity interests, including futures.

13. Under Regulation 5.1(d)(1), 17 C.F.R. § 5.1(d)(1) (2019), a CPO is defined as any
person who operates or solicits funds, securities, or property for a pooled investment vehicle that
is not an Eligible Contract Participant (“ECP”) as defined in Section 1a(18) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
§ 1a(18) (2018), and that engages in forex.

14. During the Relevant Period, Pyatt was a CTA as defined in Section 1(a)(12) of the
Act, 7 U.S.C. § 1(a)(12) (2018), because Pyatt, for compensation or profit, engaged in the

business of advising WRI as to value of or the advisability of trading in futures.
 

15. | Under Commission Regulation 5.1(e)(1), 17 C.F.R. § 5.1(e)(1), (2019), a CTA
means, in relevant part, any person who exercises discretionary trading authority or obtains
written authorization to exercise discretionary trading authority over any account for or on behalf
of any person that is not an ECP in connection with forex.

16. —_ Insoliciting pool participants, Defendants made no attempt to determine if they
were ECPs. In fact, upon information and belief, most, if not all, of Defendants’ pool
participants were not ECPs.

B. Defendants’ Acceptance of Pool Participant Funds

17. During the Relevant Period, Defendants accepted funds from poo! participants,
typically in increments of $5,000. Each increment was referred to as a “contract.”

18. During the Relevant Period, Defendants accepted at least approximately $200,000
from poo! participants for the purpose of trading futures and forex.

19. Pursuant to agreements signed by pool participants, Defendants promised to
deposit pool participant funds into one of two accounts at “Chase Bank / First International Bank
& Trust.” Defendants promised that those funds would then be deposited into an account at TD
Ameritrade. Under the agreements, pool participants had the option of depositing funds directly
into the TD Ameritrade account.

C. Defendants’ Representations About Trading and Promised Returns

20. —‘ Pyatt told at least one pool participant that Pyatt managed at least $1,000,000,
which Pyatt used to trade futures and some stocks at TD Ameritrade.

21. Pyatt told at least one pool participant that he developed a trading algorithm and

that he was a successful trader.
22.  Pyatt told at least one pool participant that he traded profitably, generating
$30,000 profit on a $10,000 placement in six months and $240,000 profit in one year. Pyatt told
at least one pool participant that he had generated $130,000 profit on an initial investment of
$20,000.

23. The agreement pool participants signed at Pyatt’s direction stated that “[t]he low
average expected return on investments across the board is 15% per month.”

24. Upon information and belief, Pyatt’s representations contained in paragraphs 20-
23 are false.

D. Defendants’ Representations and Omissions About the Use of Pool Participant
Funds

25. The agreement signed by pool participants provided that “all funds are pooled into
one account” and “the purpose of trading all funds together is to give us a higher volume to trade
with.”

26. | The agreement also stated that pool participant funds would be used to trade: “I
will be trading ‘futures’ and ‘forex’ in a day-trading format and will specialize in energy related
stocks, Gold, NASDAQ and oil.”

27. Under the agreement pool participants signed, WRI charged each participant $300
per month for market analysis. The agreement further provided that the fee for WRI’s services
would be 10% of all gains.

28. Under the agreement, all pool participant funds were to be used to trade. Based
on their interactions with Pyatt, pool participants believed that all of the funds placed with WRI
would be traded on their behalf.

29.  Pyatt did not tell prospective pool participants that their funds would be used to

pay his business and personal expenses.
E. Defendants Used Only a Fraction of Pool Participant Funds To Trade

30. Defendants opened two accounts at TD Ameritrade in April 2017, one futures
account and one securities account. These accounts were opened in the name of “Daniel
Randolph.”

31. Asalleged above, Defendants accepted at least approximately $200,000 from pool
participants. Those funds were initially deposited into a TD Ameritrade securities account.

32. Defendants did not trade in the TD Ameritrade securities account.

33. During the Relevant Period, Defendants transferred only a fraction of the
approximately $200,000 provided by pool participants from the TD Ameritrade securities
account into the TD Ameritrade futures account. Transfers into the TD Ameritrade futures
account totaled only approximately $13,000.

34. Defendants used the TD Ameritrade futures account to trade various futures
contracts between April 2017 and February 2019.

F. Defendants Misappropriated Pool Participant Funds To Make Periodic Payments to
Other Pool Participants and To Pay Business and Personal Expenses

35. Defendants used pool participant funds to make Ponzi-like payments to other
participants.

36. Defendants made payments of approximately $36,000 to various pool participants
from the TD Ameritrade securities account.

37. As alleged below, for most of the Relevant Period, Defendants were unprofitable
trading pool participant funds. To the extent that Defendants’ trading generated profits, those
profits were not sufficient to sustain the periodic payments to pool participants.

38. Defendants also used pool participant funds to pay business and personal

expenses. For example, payments were made from the TD Ameritrade securities account to
American Airlines, Best Buy, Eddie Bauer, Pizza Hut, Prime Video, Smokey Mountain Cigars,
Starbucks, Uber, Verizon Wireless, Walmart, and Zales Outlet, among others.
G. Defendants’ Trading Was Not Profitable Overall

39. The TD Ameritrade futures account was active between April 2017 and February
2019, a total of twenty-three months.

40. Defendants traded in the TD Ameritrade futures account during only fifteen of
those twenty-three months.

41. Defendants’ trading during nine of those fifteen months resulted in realized losses
totaling approximately $15,081, while trading during the remaining six months resulted in
realized gains totaling approximately $1,644.

42. Overall, trading in the TD Ameritrade futures account was cumulatively resulted
in a net loss of approximately $13,416.

H. Defendants Provided Statements to Pool Participants that
Did Not Accurately Reflect WRI’s Trading Performance

43. Defendants provided monthly reports to pool participants concerning activity in
the WRI pool. These reports were typically transmitted to pool participants via a group email.

44. These monthly reports typically referred to substantial profits. For example,
Defendants’ monthly report for September 2018 stated that trading resulted in a 36% profit for
the month, that is, $1,800 profit per “contract.” Defendants’ monthly report for December 2018
stated that trading resulted in an 18.8% profit, that is, $941 profit per “contract.” A third
monthly report transmitted by Defendants claimed profits of 86.5%, that is, $4,327 per $5,000
contract, while a fourth claimed profits of 83.9%, that is, $4,195 per $5,000 contract.

45. | The monthly reports provided by Defendants to pool participants did not

accurately reflect WRI’s trading performance.
46, Defendants also provided individual updates covering multiple months of account
activity to at least two pool participants. According to a report Defendants sent via email to
those pool participants, their initial placement of $10,000 yielded net profits of $24,035 in three
months, and additional profits of $110,146 on the following six months.

47, The individual updates Defendants provided to pool participants did not
accurately reflect WRI’s trading performance.
