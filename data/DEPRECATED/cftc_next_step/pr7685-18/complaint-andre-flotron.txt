V.
ANDRE FLOTRON, JURY TRIAL DEMANDED
Defendant,

 

 

COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, CIVIL MONETARY
PENALTIES, AND OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF

Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) alleges as follows:

I. SUMMARY

1. Beginning in at least August 2008 through at least November 2013 (the “Relevant
Period”), Defendant Andre Flotron (“Flotron’’) engaged in a manipulative and deceptive scheme
in the precious metals futures markets on a registered entity. As part of this scheme, Flotron
engaged in manipulative or deceptive acts and practices by “spoofing” (bidding or offering with
the intent to cancel the bid or offer before execution) on an ongoing basis. On numerous
occasions, Flotron placed a visibly small order for COMEX gold or silver futures contracts that
he wanted to get filled (the “Genuine Order’) and entered a larger order for the same contract on
the opposite side of the book that he intended to cancel before execution (the “Spoof Order’). In
placing these Spoof Orders, Flotron intentionally sent false signals of increased demand or

increased supply designed to trick other market participants into executing against his Genuine

Orders, or Flotron recklessly disregarded that the Spoof Orders would send such false signals to
market participants.

2. By virtue of this conduct, as further alleged herein, from approximately July 2011
through at least November 2013, Flotron’s trading practices described above violated Section
4c(a)(5)(C) of the Commodity Exchange Act (the “Act’), 7 U.S.C. § 6c(a)(5)(C) (2012).

3. By virtue of this conduct, as further alleged herein, from approximately August
2011 through at least November 2013, Flotron engaged in acts and practices that violated Section
6(c)(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 9(1) (2012), and Commission Regulation (“Regulation’”’)
180.1(a)(1) and (3), 17 C.F.R. § 180.1(a)(1), (3) (2017).

4. Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1
(2012), to enjoin Flotron’s violative acts and practices and to compel Flotron’s compliance with
the Act. In addition, Plaintiff seeks civil monetary penalties and such other equitable relief,
including but not limited to disgorgement, as this Court deems necessary and appropriate.

If. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

5. This Court has jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (2012)
(federal question jurisdiction) and 28 U.S.C. § 1345 (2012), which provides that district courts
have original jurisdiction over civil actions commenced by the United States or by any agency
expressly authorized to sue by Act of Congress. Section 6c(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1(a)
(2012), authorizes the Commission to seek injunctive relief against any person whenever it shall
appear to the Commission that such person has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in
any act or practice constituting a violations of any provision of the Act or any rule, regulation or

order thereunder.

6. Venue properly lies with this Court, pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
§ 13a-1(e) (2012), because Flotron is found in this District or transacted business in this District.
Venue is also proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(c)(3).

Hil. PARTIES

7. Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an independent federal
regulatory agency that is charged by Congress with the administration and enforcement of the
Act and Regulations promulgated thereunder.

8. Defendant Andre Flotron was employed by Bank A as a trader from at least
2008 to January 2014. For the duration of this time period, Flotron was employed as a trader and
in a managerial capacity, overseeing other precious metals traders at Bank A, including but not
limited to those based in Bank A’s Stamford, Connecticut offices. Flotron has never been
registered with the Commission. Flotron is a Swiss national domiciled in Switzerland. He is
currently, however, in the United States and must remain here pending trial pursuant to this
Court’s order in United States v. Flotron, 17-cr-00220.

IV. FACTS

A. Market Fundamentals

9. A Futures Contract is an agreement to purchase or sell a commodity for delivery
or cash settlement in the future at a specified price. A futures contract traded on an exchange has
standard, non-negotiable contract specifications.

10. An “Order,” in the context of electronic exchange trading, is a request submitted
to an exchange to buy (that is, “bid”’) or sell (that is, “offer’’?) a certain number of a specified
futures contract. An order is for one or more contracts. Contracts may also be called “‘lots,”
among other things. Orders are entered into the exchange’s Order Book. When one or more

contracts in an order are bought or sold, that is a “fill” (or a “trade” or “execution”). At any time

3
before the order is fully filled, the trader can “cancel” the order. When an order is canceled, the
contracts that have not yet been bought or sold are pulled from the Order Book.

11. When a “buy” or “sell” order is submitted to an exchange’s electronic trading
system, the order becomes part of the Order Book. In the Order Book, each trader can view the
aggregate number of contracts that all traders are actively bidding or offering at a given price
level. The best-bid level, or first-bid level, is the highest price at which someone is willing to
buy. The best-offer level, or first-offer level, is the lowest price at which someone is willing to
sell. The bid-ask spread is the difference between those two prices.

12. Traders can view the aggregate resting contracts and orders up to the tenth-bid
and tenth-offer levels. This combined bid and offer information is often referred to as the visible
Order Book and represents the visible market depth. Traders often rely on information in the
Order Book to make trading decisions.

13. Order Book Balance refers to the numeric relationship between the number of
pending visible contracts offered and the number of pending visible contracts bid. Many market
participants rely on the information contained in the Order Book and consider it when making
trading decisions. For instance, if the aggregate size and number of sell orders significantly
outweighs the total aggregate size and number of buy orders, market participants may believe
that the Order Book Balance indicates that supply is exceeding demand and a price drop is
imminent. Accordingly, they may decide to place orders to sell.

14. Commodity Exchange, Inc. (““COMEX”’) is a futures exchange located in New
York, New York. COMEX is a designated contract market for trading futures and options under

the Act. COMEX is owned and operated by CME Group, Inc. (“CME Group’), which is a
OP eS FO Th ps ae a FO
wiser mo APE by OUT
fads A PERL ae AE Sk.

Delaware corporation with its headquarters in Chicago, Illinois. CME Group’s COMEX lists for
trading gold futures, silver futures, and other precious metals contracts.

15. COMEX Gold Contract is regularly traded on Globex (CME’s electronic trading
system) for delivery during the current calendar month, the next two calendar months, any
February, April, August, and October falling within a 23-month period, and any June and
December falling within a 72-month period beginning with the current month. One contract unit
is equal to 100 troy ounces. The COMEX Gold Contract is generally referred to herein as “Gold
Futures.”

16. COMEX Silver Contract is regularly traded for delivery during the current
calendar month, the next two calendar months, any January, March, May, and September falling
within a 23-month period, and any July and December falling within a 60-month period
beginning with the current month. One contract unit is equal to 5,000 troy ounces. The COMEX
Silver Contract is generally referred to herein as “Silver Futures.”

17. Tick refers to the minimum price fluctuation for a particular futures contract. The
minimum price fluctuation for Gold Futures is $.10 per troy ounce. The minimum price
fluctuation for Silver Futures is $.005 per troy ounce.

18. Globex’s matching algorithm applies a First-In-First-Out (“FIFO’’) principle to
orders at the same level of the Order Book. For example, if there are multiple orders sitting at
the level of the best bid, and an offer is then placed at that same level, the bids will be filled in
the order that they were placed. Modifications to price or quantity will move the order to the

back of the queue.

B. Flotron’s Manipulative and Deceptive Scheme

19. During the Relevant Period, Flotron engaged in an ongoing practice of spoofing.
Flotron entered comparatively large orders for precious metals futures contracts, which he
intended to cancel before execution (Spoof Orders), opposite smaller orders for precious metals
futures contracts, which he desired to execute (Genuine Orders). Flotron entered the Spoof
Orders with the intent to send false signals to market participants about the balance of the Order
Book and trick market participants into transacting on his Genuine Orders, or, at the very least,
with reckless disregard for the fact that his Spoof Orders would send such false signals to market
participants.

20. For example, from time to time, Flotron would enter a Genuine Order for less
than 10 lots and, usually within 30 seconds thereafter, place a Spoof Order of 20 or more lots on
the other side of the Order Book. More specifically, Flotron often placed the larger, Spoof
Orders in an amount where the digits were the same (e.g., 22 lots, 33 lots, 44 lots, 55 lots, 99
lots, 111 lots). Typically, Flotron’s Spoof Orders were placed at least one tick behind the best
price so as to reduce the likelihood of them being filled.

21. At times, in the event Flotron’s initial Genuine Order was filled, he would then
place a series of additional small Genuine Orders while the Spoof Order was still pending.
These additional Genuine Orders tended to be at the same price as the initial Genuine Order.
Moreover, the additional small Genuine Orders were, at times, placed in rapid succession,
indicating that Flotron sometimes used an automated tool that conditioned the placement of an
additional order on a prior one being filled.

22. Upon placement of a Spoof Order, Flotron intended to cancel it before execution.

The cancellation usually occurred after his Genuine Order or series of Genuine Orders was filled.
23. When his Genuine Order was a buy order, Flotron’s Spoof Order was an offer to
sell. In placing these Spoof Orders to sell, Flotron intended to send market participants a false
signal of greater supply to create the impression that the price would likely decline and trick
market participants into transacting on his Genuine Order to buy, or acted with reckless disregard
that the Spoof Orders would send such false signals to market participants.

24. When Flotron’s Genuine Order was an offer to sell, Flotron’s Spoof Order was a
buy order. In placing these Spoof Orders to buy, Flotron intended to send market participants a
false signal of greater demand to create the impression that the price would likely rise and trick
market participants into transacting on his Genuine Order to sell, or acted with reckless disregard
that the Spoof Orders would send such false signals to market participants.

25. In placing the Spoof Orders, Flotron gave market participants the false impression
that he actually wanted to buy or sell the number of contracts in the orders when, in reality, he
did not.

26. Flotron engaged in the manipulative and deceptive scheme by spoofing to trick
other market participants into executing against his Genuine Orders—to cause his Genuine
Orders to be filled sooner, at a better price, or in larger quantities than they otherwise would.

27. Flotron knew or recklessly disregarded that the Spoof Orders would create a false
impression of Order Book Balance and result in misinformation, thereby luring market
participants to trade based on Flotron’s spoofing. The risk that the Spoof Orders could mislead
other market participants into believing there was genuine interest in purchasing or selling the
specified number of contracts represented by Flotron’s Spoof Orders was so obvious that Flotron
must have been aware of it. He knew that his Spoof Orders would appear in the Order Book and

that traders often considered Order Book Balance information in making trading decisions.
Case 3:18-cv-00158 Document1 Filed 01/26/18 Page 8 of 21

Thus, Flotron was, at least, reckless with respect to the danger that his Spoof Orders would
mislead other market participants.
C. Flotron Spoofed and Taught a Subordinate How To Spoof

28. In or about July 2008, Trader A began working on Bank A’s precious metals
trading desk in Stamford, Connecticut. For approximately Trader A’s first two months on the
desk in Stamford, Flotron was the primary person assigned to train Trader A. Trader A sat next
to Flotron in Bank A’s Stamford office and observed Flotron’s trading practices.

29. During Trader A’s training, Flotron gave Trader A instructions on how to spoof
and demonstrated spoofing for Trader A’s benefit. Specifically, Flotron explained that Trader A
should place an order Trader A wanted filled and that such an order should be broken up, or
“iceberged,” such that only a small piece of it was visible to the market at a time. Flotron further
explained that Trader A should then place a large, fully visible, “spoof” order on the opposite
side of the market in an effort to trick market participants (including algorithmic traders) into
transacting on his Genuine Order. Trader A learned from Flotron to cancel the “spoof” order
after the Genuine Order was hit (or lifted), so that the Spoof Order would not get filled.

30. During the period in which he was training Trader A in Stamford, Flotron
spoofed. For example, on August 29, 2008, at 13:10:15.5 36,! Flotron placed a 7-lot Genuine
Order to buy December-delivery Gold Futures at $836.40. The 7-lot Genuine Order remained
pending for approximately ten seconds, at which point Flotron placed a 44-lot Spoof Order to
sell at $836.80 that he intended to cancel before execution. Less than two-tenths of a second
after Flotron placed the 44-lot Spoof Order, the 7-lot Genuine Order was filled in its entirety.

Flotron then placed a series of three additional 7-lot Genuine Orders to buy and then one 5-lot

 

All times referred to herein are Eastern Time.

8
Case 3:18-cv-00158 Documenti1 Filed 01/26/18 Page 9 of 21

Genuine Order to buy that were all filled over the next two seconds at either $836.40 or $836.30.
Approximately two seconds after the 5-lot buy order was filled, Flotron cancelled the 44-lot
Spoof Order to sell in its entirety.

31. While on Bank A’s precious metals desk in Stamford, and in accordance with the
training he received from Flotron, Trader A spoofed. For example, on October 9, 2008, at
8:42:49.115, Trader A placed a 3-lot order to sell December-delivery Gold Futures at $889.50.
This 3-lot Genuine Order remained pending for over six minutes without getting filled. At
8:49:18.528, Trader A entered a 40-lot Spoof Order to buy December-delivery Gold Futures at
$888.50 that he intended to cancel before execution. At 8:49:49.258, Trader A’s 3-lot order to
sell was still pending, so he placed another Spoof Order to buy—this time of 20 lots—at
$889.00, five ticks higher than his original Spoof Order to buy. Less than three seconds later,
Trader A’s 3-lot Genuine Order to sell began to be filled. Trader A then placed a series of other
small sell orders at $889.50 that were also filled over the next several seconds. At 8:50:16.626,
Trader A cancelled his 20-lot Spoof Order in its entirety. At 8:52:02.264, after he placed and
was filled on a series of even more small sell orders at $889.50, Trader A also cancelled his 40-
lot Spoof Order in its entirety.

D. Examples of Flotron’s Scheme Continuing Through 2013

32. Flotron continued to engage in a regular practice of spoofing in the manner
described above through 2013, including but not limited to the following occasions. With each
Spoof Order he placed, Flotron intended to, or acted with reckless disregard that it would, send a
false signal of increased supply or a false signal of increased demand to market participants.
Flotron placed each Spoof Order with the intent to, or with reckless disregard that it would, trick

market participants into transacting on his Genuine Order(s) and cause his Genuine Orders to be
filled sooner, at a better price, or in larger quantities that they otherwise would. His pattern, as
evidenced below, of placing Spoof Orders that were always canceled after his Genuine Orders
were filled demonstrates that he always intended to cancel those Spoof Orders prior to execution.

I. September 6, 2011 Spoofing

33. On September 6, 2011, at approximately 5:06:32.3, Flotron placed a 1-lot
Genuine Order to buy December-delivery Gold Futures at $1893.70 and a 1-lot Genuine Order to
buy the same contract at $1893.60. The 1-lot bid at $1893.70 was the best bid at the time of
placement.

34. Approximately two and a half seconds later, at 5:06:35.057, Flotron placed a 33-
lot Spoof Order to sell at $1894.30 that he intended to cancel before execution. His 33-lot order

to sell was three ticks away from the best offer at the time of placement.

35. Both of Flotron’s 1-lot buy orders were filled less than one tenth of a second
thereafter.
36. Over the next six seconds, Flotron (either manually or through an automated

trading tool he controlled) placed a series of fourteen additional 1-lot Genuine Orders to buy that
were filled at either $1893.60 or $1893.70.

37. At 5:06:43.251, Flotron cancelled his 33-lot Spoof Order to sell in its entirety.

2. June 28, 2012 Spoofing

38. On June 28, 2012, at 13:26:33.786, Flotron placed a 1-lot Genuine Order to buy
August-delivery Gold Futures at $1550.10. At the time, $1550.10 was the best bid in the market.
The price, however, moved away from Flotron’s bid over the next eight seconds, trading as high

as $1550.40.

10
39. At 13:26:39.028, Flotron placed another 1-lot Genuine Order to buy August-
delivery Gold Futures at $1550.20.

AO. At 13:26:42.415, with both genuine buy orders still pending, Flotron placed a 55-
lot Spoof Order to sell August-delivery Gold Futures at $1550.50 that he intended to cancel
before execution.

41. Flotron’s 55-lot sell order was two ticks away from the best offer at the time it
was placed.

42. Flotron’s 1-lot buy order at $1550.20 was filled less than one-hundredth of a
second after the placement of the Spoof Order. And his initial 1-lot buy order at $1550.10 was
filled approximately one second later.

43. At 13:26:53.313, approximately three seconds after the last in a series of
additional small genuine buy orders was filled, Flotron cancelled his 55-lot Spoof Order to sell in
its entirety.

3. February 15, 2013 Spoofing

44, On February 15, 2013, at 5:59:28.544, Flotron placed a 1-lot Genuine Order to
buy March-delivery Silver Futures at $30.180. At the time of placement, this Genuine Order was
at the best price level, but not the first in the queue.

45. The Genuine Order sat pending for over four seconds, at which point Flotron
placed a 55-lot Spoof Order to sell March-delivery Silver Futures at $30.190 that he intended to
cancel before execution.

46. At the time of placement, the Spoof Order to sell was one tick away from the best

offer.

11
47. At the time Flotron placed the 55-lot Spoof Order, the total visible sell-side order

volume was 116 lots. His Spoof Order, therefore, increased the visible sell-side volume by

almost 50%.
A8. Less than one-tenth of a second later, Flotron’s Genuine Order was filled.
49. Less than four-tenths of a second after this fill, Flotron (either manually or

through an automated trading tool he controlled) placed a series of four additional 1-lot Genuine
Orders at $30.180 that were filled in quick succession (within 1.5 seconds).

50. Flotron cancelled the 55-lot Spoof Order to sell less than two seconds after the
fourth additional 1-lot Genuine Order was filled.

4. July 1, 2013 Spoofing

51. On July 1, 2013, at 10:11:06.151, Flotron placed at 1-lot Genuine Order to sell
August-delivery Gold Futures at a price of $1238.50. At the time of placement, the order was
two ticks away from the best offer in the Order Book (and there were seven lots better offered).
Over the next seventeen seconds, several lots traded but none at a price higher than $1238.30.

52. At 10:11:23.173, with his 1-lot sell order still pending at $1238.50, Flotron placed
a 111-lot Spoof Order to buy August-delivery Gold Futures at $1237.90 that he intended to
cancel before execution.

53. At the time he placed this 111-lot Spoof Order to buy, it was three ticks below the
best bid.

54. At the time Flotron placed the 111-lot Spoof Order to buy, the visible volume on
the offer side of the Order Book was 127 lots and the visible volume on the buy side of the Order

Book was 119 lots. Therefore, Flotron’s 111-lot Spoof Order converted an Order Book that had

12
been relatively balanced into one in which there was almost twice as much volume bid as there
was offered.

55. Within 1.2 seconds of the placement of the 111-lot Spoof Order to buy, the
market moved two ticks up, filling Flotron’s 1-lot sell order at $1238.50 and a subsequent 1|-lot
sell order at $1238.60.

56. Over the next 29 seconds, the market fluctuated between $1238.80 and $1238.30;
Flotron’s 111-lot Spoof Order to buy was at least four ticks away from the last trade.

57. At 10:11:53.227, the price dropped to $1238.20 and at 10:11:54.543 it dropped to
$1238.10, only two ticks away from Flotron’s 111-lot Spoof Order.

58. Less than one second after the price dropped to $1238.10 and approached his 111-
lot Spoof Order, Flotron cancelled his 111-lot Spoof Order in its entirety.

59. Within one-hundredth of a second of Flotron cancelling his 111-lot Spoof Order
to buy, the market traded at $1237.90—the price at which his 111-lot Spoof Order had been.

60. In short, Flotron never intended for the 111-lot order to be executed; he cancelled
it as it became likely that it—or some portion of it—would get filled.

5. October 14, 2013 Spoofing

61. On October 14, 2013, at 8:26:47.706, Flotron entered a 5-lot Genuine Order to
buy December-delivery Gold Futures contracts at a price of $1284.80. At the time of placement
it was the best bid; the best offer was at $1284.90.

62. Less than one second later, at 8:26:48.474, with his 5-lot bid still pending, Flotron
placed a 55-lot Spoof Order to sell December-delivery Gold Futures contracts at a price of

$1285.10 that he intended to cancel before execution.

13
63. At the time he placed this 55-lot Spoof Order to sell, it was two ticks from the
best offer.

64. At the time Flotron placed the 55-lot Spoof Order to sell, there was a total volume
of 89 lots visible on the sell side of the Order Book and none of the five best offer levels
contained a total volume of more than nine lots. The visible volume on the buy side of the Order
Book was 85 lots and none of the five best bid levels contained a total volume of more than nine
lots. Therefore, Flotron’s 55-lot order turned an Order Book that had been relatively balanced
into one in which there was over 60% more volume on the visible sell side of the book than on
the visible buy side. Moreover, the size of Flotron’s offer was more than three times the total
volume at any other visible price level.

65. At 8:26:49.466, less than one second after he placed the 55-lot Spoof Order at
$1285.10, Flotron’s 5-lot buy order was filled at $1284.80.

66. Following this fill, Flotron immediately—within a few tenths of a second—placed
(either manually or through an automated trading tool he controlled) a series of three additional
5-lot Genuine Orders to buy and one additional 1-lot Genuine Order to buy that were filled at
$1284.70 and $1284.80 in quick succession (within the next second).

67. When the market started to move back up toward Flotron’s 55-lot Spoof Order to
sell, he cancelled it. Specifically, at 8:26:52.720, the best bid went from $1284.60 (where it had
been for about 1.5 seconds) to 1284.90, only two ticks from Flotron’s 55-lot offer. Flotron
cancelled the 55-lot Spoof Order to sell in its entirety less than four-tenths of a second later.

68. Flotron cancelled the 55-lot Spoof Order as it became more likely that it—or

some portion of it—would get filled.

14
6. October 17, 2013 Spoofing

69. On October 17, 2013, Flotron placed three disproportionately large Spoof Orders
in a span of two and a half minutes, each of which he intended to cancel before execution.

70. At 11:13:35.407, Flotron placed a 55-lot Spoof Order to sell December-delivery
Gold Futures at $1319.40 that he intended to cancel before execution. At the time it was placed,
the best offer stood one tick away, at $1319.30. The best bid was $1319.10. By volume, the 55-
lot sell order was equal to nearly 60% of the entire visible buy-side order volume. It was also
more than twice as large as the total volume at any other level in the visible Order Book.

71. Approximately one-tenth of a second after placing the 55-lot Spoof Order to sell,
Flotron placed a 1-lot Genuine Order to buy December-delivery Gold Futures at $1319.20, one
tick higher than the previous best bid. The genuine buy order was filled immediately. About 10
seconds later, after getting filled on six more successive 1-lot bids at $1319.20, Flotron cancelled
the 55-lot Spoof Order to sell in its entirety.

72. At 11:13:55.778, Flotron placed another 1-lot Genuine Order to buy at $1319.20.
At the time of placement, it was the best bid in the market. The best offer at the time was
$1319.30.

73. Despite being the best bid, the 1-lot order sat in the Order Book unfilled for over
4 seconds, at which point Flotron placed a 77-lot Spoof Order to sell at $1319.50 that he
intended to cancel before execution.

74. Just prior to placement of the 77-lot order, the total visible sell-side order volume
was 119 lots and the total visible buy-side order volume was 93 lots. The 77-lot Spoof Order,

therefore, increased the total visible sell-side volume by over 60%.

15
75. One millisecond after the placement of the 77-lot order, Flotron’s 1-lot Genuine
Order to buy was filled at $1319.20.

76. Flotron (either manually or through an automated trading tool he controlled)
subsequently placed six successive 1-lot Genuine Orders to buy at $1319.20, five of which were
filled. The sixth sat at the top of the Order Book for six seconds, at which point Flotron
modified the price of his 77-lot Spoof Order from $1319.50 to $1319.40.

77. Approximately 2.4 seconds after this downward modification, the sixth 1-lot buy
order was filled.

78. At 11:14:26.516, the market traded up to $1319.30, just one tick away from the
77-\ot order that Flotron intended to cancel before execution.

79. Flotron cancelled the 77-lot order in its entirety at 11:14:31.086.

80. At 11:15:33.964, Flotron placed a 1-lot Genuine Order to buy at $1319.10. At the
time this order was placed, it was one tick away from the best bid. The best offer was $1319.30.

81. At 11:15:37.060, Flotron placed a 99-lot Spoof Order to sell at $1319.60 that he
intended to cancel before execution. At the time it was placed, the 99-lot order was four ticks
away from the best offer. At the time, the entire volume on the visible buy side of the Order
Book was only 107 lots, the entire volume on the sell side was only 84 lots, and no single price
level in the entire visible Order Book contained an order volume of greater than 17 lots.
Flotron’s 99-lot Spoof Order more than doubled the volume on the sell side of the Order Book.

82. No trades occurred in the market for the next four seconds.

83. At 11:15:41.248, Flotron modified his 99-lot sell order down one tick, to
$1319.50. Less than one second later, Flotron’s 1-lot Genuine Order to buy at $1319.10 was

filled. Flotron (either manually or through an automated tool he controlled) placed four

16
additional 1-lot Genuine Orders at $1319.10 in succession. Three were filled immediately. The
fourth sat pending for four seconds, at which point Flotron modified his 99-lot order down one
tick again to $1319.40. Less than two seconds later, the fourth 1-lot buy order was filled at
$1319.10.

84. Again, Flotron placed four additional 1-lot Genuine Orders to buy at $1319.10,
three of which were filled over approximately the next four seconds. After the fourth 1-lot buy
order had been pending for about three seconds, the volume on the buy side of the Order Book
significantly increased. Specifically, 60 lots were added to the buy-side volume in the course of
a second. The market price immediately went up to $1319.20, only two ticks away from
Flotron’s 99-lot Spoof Order that he did not want to be filled.

85. Approximately one second after the price went up Flotron cancelled the 99-lot
Spoof Order in its entirety.
