ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTION 6(c) AND (d) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, MAKING
FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL sanctions

I. INTRODUCTION

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“Commission”) has reason to believe that
from on or about February 6, 2014 to March 8, 2019 (“Relevant Period’’), Gain Capital UK
Limited (“Gain UK” or “Respondent’), acting through Gain Capital Forex.com UK Limited until
its business operations were integrated into Gain UK on October 6, 2017, violated Section
2(c)(2)(C)G1)(1)(aa) of the Commodity Exchange Act (“Act”), 7 U.S.C. § 2(c)(2)(C)Gi1)(1)(aa)
(2018), and Commission Regulations (“Regulations”) 5.3(a)(6)() and 166.3, 17 C.F.R.

§§ 5.3(a)(6)(1), 166.3 (2019) promulgated thereunder. Therefore, the Commission deems it
appropriate and in the public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are,
instituted to determine whether Respondent engaged in the violations set forth herein and to
determine whether any order should be issued imposing remedial sanctions.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Respondent has
submitted an Offer of Settlement (“Offer”), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Without admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, Respondent consents to
the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Section 6(c) and (d) of the Commodity
Exchange Act, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial sanctions (“Order”) and acknowledges
service of this Order.’

 

' Respondent consents to the use of the findings of fact and conclusions of law in this Order in this proceeding and
in any other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party or claimant, and agrees
that they shall be taken as true and correct and be given preclusive effect therein, without further proof. Respondent
does not consent, however, to the use of this Order, or the findings or conclusions herein, as the sole basis for any
other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party or claimant, other than: a
proceeding in bankruptcy or receivership; or a proceeding to enforce the terms of this Order. Respondent does not
consent to the use of the Offer or this Order, or the findings or conclusions in this Order, by any other party in any
other proceeding.
II. FINDINGS
The Commission finds the following:
A. SUMMARY

From at least February 6, 2014 to March 8, 2019 (“Relevant Period”), Gain UK, without
being registered with the Commission as a retail foreign exchange dealer (“RFED”), accepted a
limited number of customers who were located in the United States and not Eligible Contract
Participants (“ECPs”’) to open retail forex accounts. Gain UK also failed to diligently supervise
the handling of an account for one of the non-ECP customers (“Customer A’’) that was managed
by an unregistered commodity trading advisor (“Trading Advisor’). A Gain UK employee
learned that Trading Advisor was required to be registered, and Gain UK failed to detect several
warning signs that Trading Advisor was defrauding Customer A.

B. RESPONDENT

Gain Capital UK Limited is an unregistered RFED located in London, England. During
the Relevant Period, Gain Capital Forex.com UK Limited was an unregistered RFED located in
London, England until its business operations were integrated into Gain UK on October 6, 2017.

C. FACTS

1. Gain UK Accepted Orders for Forex Transactions from Non-ECP
Customers Located in the United States.

During the Relevant Period, Gain UK acted as a counterparty to non-ECP customers who
were located in the United States in connection with leveraged retail forex transactions while not
being registered as an RFED. Gain UK had a policy to prevent non-ECP customers located in
the United States from opening retail forex accounts. Despite that policy, however, a limited
number of customers (who provided Gain UK with information that suggested the customers
were located in the United States) succeeded in opening accounts with Gain UK. For example,
some retail forex customers—after identifying U.S. mailing addresses on account applications—
provided Gain UK with documents such as lease agreements, utility bills, and health-insurance
enrollment letters further suggesting that the customers were located in the United States.
Similarly, Customer A (who provided a copy of her foreign government issued identification that
matched the primary non-U.S. address on her account application) listed a U.S. mailing address
and telephone number on her account application, and when asked by a Gain UK employee,
informed Gain UK that she was a student at a university in the United States. Gain UK,
nonetheless, permitted her to open a retail forex account.

2. Gain UK Failed To Diligently Supervise the Handling of a Retail Forex
Account of a Non-ECP Customer Located in the United States.

Gain UK failed to diligently supervise the handling of Customer A’s retail forex account.
First, as relevant here, Trading Advisor—and acting through his company—solicited
Customer A, to open an individually managed forex trading account with Gain UK. During the
account opening process, Trading Advisor communicated with a Gain UK employee about
Customer A’s account. Even though Customer A was located in the United States, Trading
Advisor directed her to open a managed forex account with Gain UK—based in part on
communications Trading Advisor had with the Gain UK employee, who advised Trading
Advisor how Customer A could open a retail forex account with Gain UK. The employee was
aware that Trading Advisor had been rejected from managing accounts with Gain UK, as well as
its affiliates, because Trading Advisor may have been soliciting managed accounts through
social media and a website while not being registered with the Commission. The employee,
however, assisted Trading Advisor in establishing Trading Advisor’s father as the nominal
account manager and Trading Advisor’s mother as the nominal introducing broker, even though
Customer A listed Trading Advisor’s entity as the account manager on her application. And,
despite Trading Advisor not being named on any of the account documents, Trading Advisor had
extensive communications with Gain UK’s employee about Customer A’s account, including
about creating it, directing the trading in it, and refunding commissions to it to reimburse
significant trading losses. Gain UK failed to promptly detect these discrepancies.

Second, Gain UK permitted Trading Advisor’s mother to earn commissions based on the
trading in Customer A’s account—purportedly being managed by Trading Advisor’s father—
without regard to the trading profits earned for Customer A. When Customer A’s account
incurred over $250,000 in losses within the first few weeks of opening, Trading Advisor
requested that some of the commissions earned be refunded to Customer A’s account to
compensate the customer for some of the trading losses. Even though the rermbursement of
commissions was escalated to Gain UK’s compliance department, Gain UK did not perform an
adequate investigation into the account activity and failed to detect the extensive
communications between Trading Advisor and Gain UK’s employee. Due to Trading Advisor’s
fraudulent conduct, Customer A suffered approximately $280,000 in losses and Gain UK earned
$241,671.

Hil. LEGAL DISCUSSION

A. Gain UK Failed To Register as an RFED in violations of
Section 2(c)(2)(C)(iii)(D(aa) of the Act and Regulation 5.3(a)(6)(i).

The Commission’s registration requirements for commodity professionals are a
cornerstone of the regulatory framework enacted by Congress to protect the public. See
CFTC v. British Am. Commodity Options Corp., 560 F.2d 135, 139-40 (2d Cir. 1977); see
also CFTC v. Savage, 611 F.2d 270, 280 (9th Cir. 1979). Failure to register 1s a serious
offense, and not a mere technical violations. CFTC v. Heritage Capital Advisory Servs.,
[1980-1982 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) J 21,627 at 26,387 (N.D. Ill. Nov.
8, 1982).

Section 2(c)(2)(C)(i11)()(aa) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 2(c)(2)(C) aii) (1) (aa) (2018),
states that a person shall not “solicit or accept orders” for an agreement, contract, or
transaction in foreign currency “from any person that is not an eligible contract participant”
without being “registered in such capacity as the Commission” requires. Section
1a(18)(A)(x1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 1a(18)(A)(xi) (2018), defines an ECP, in relevant part, as an
individual who has amounts invested on a discretionary basis, the aggregate of which exceeds
$10 million, or $5 million if the individual enters into the transaction to manage the risk
associated with an asset owned or liability incurred, or reasonably likely to be owned or incurred,
by the individual.

Regulation 5.1, 17 C.F.R. § 5.1(h)(1) (2019), defines RFED as “any person that is, or
that offers to be, the counterparty to a retail forex transaction” with someone that is not an
ECP. Regulation 5.3(a)(6)(), 17 C.F.R. § 5.3(a)(6)G) (2019), requires any person that meets
the definition of RFED to register with the Commission. See, e.g., CFTC v. Interforex, 11-
cv-6203, 2012 WL 1190900, at *3 (N.D. Ill. Feb. 2, 2012) (consent order); In re Forex
Capital Markets Ltd., CFTC No. 11-18, 2011 WL 3418343, at *1 (Aug. 3, 2011) (consent
order).

During the Relevant Period, Gain UK acted as an RFED without registering with the
Commission. It was the counterparty to customers located in the United States, who were
not ECPs, in connection with leveraged retail forex transactions.

B. Gain UK Failed To Diligently Supervise the Handling of a Customer’s Retail Forex
Account in violations of Regulation 166.3.

Regulation 166.3, 17 C.F.R. § 166.3 (2019), requires “[e]ach Commission registrant,
except an associated person who has no supervisory duties,” to “diligently supervise the
handling .. . of all commodity interest accounts carried, operated, advised or introduced by
the registrant.” Under Regulation 166.3, a registrant has a “duty to develop procedures for
the ‘detection and deterrence of possible wrongdoing by its agents.’” Samson Refining Co.
v. Drexel Burnham Lambert, Inc., CFTC No. 82-R448, 1990 WL 282783, at *11 (Feb. 16,
1990) (quoting Lobb v. JT McKerr & Co., CFTC No. 85-R185, 1989 WL 242384, at *11
(Dec. 14, 1989)). Regulation 166.1 defines “Commission registrant” as used in Part 166 as
“any person who is registered or required to be registered with the Commission.” Because
Gain UK was “required to be registered” during the Relevant Period, it was also subject to
Regulation 166.3’s supervision requirements.

A violations of Regulation 166.3 is established by showing either that: (1) the
registrant’s supervisory system was generally inadequate, or (2) the registrant failed to
perform its supervisory duties diligently. In re FCStone, LLC, CFTC No. 15-21, 2015
WL 2066891, at *3 (May 1, 2015) (consent order) (citing In re Murlas Commodities,
CFTC No. 85-29, 1995 WL 523563 (Sept. 1, 1995)). So, even if proper procedures are in
place, a supervisory violations may occur if a registrant fails to implement those
procedures, or fails to ensure that its agents follow those procedures. See, e.g., In re GNP
Commodities, CFTC No. 89-1, 1992 WL 201158, at *17 (Aug. 11, 1992) (providing that,
even if an adequate supervisory system is in place, Regulation 166.3 can still be violated if
the supervisory system is not diligently administered and stating that “a proper
determination of a FCM’s supervisory diligence must remain sensitive to the particular
facts and circumstances that influenced the design and execution of the system at issue’’),
aff'd sub nom. Monieson v. CFTC, 996 F.2d 852 (7th Cir. 1993).

Further, a violations of Regulation 166.3 is an independent violations for which no
underlying violations is necessary. FCStone, 2015 WL 2066891, at *3. Instead, evidence
of underlying violations that “should be detected by a diligent system of supervision, either
because of the nature of the violations or because the violations have occurred repeatedly”
is probative of a failure to diligently supervise. CFTC v. Sidoti, 178 F.3d 1132, 1137 (11th
Cir. 1999) (defendant was liable for failure to diligently supervise because he “knew of
specific instances of misconduct yet failed to take reasonable steps to correct the
problems”).

Gain UK violated Regulation 166.3 by failing to follow its procedures when it did
not promptly detect the warning signs of Trading Advisor’s fraudulent conduct toward
Customer A. Among other things, Gain UK did not investigate when Customer A listed a
different account manager on her account application than the account manager listed on the
power of attorney form. Furthermore, Gain UK did not detect that Trading Advisor—who
Gain UK previously rejected from serving as an account manager—was directly connected
to the entity Customer A listed in her account application and that Trading Advisor had
extensive communications with its employee about Customer A’s account. And when
Trading Advisor requested that commissions be refunded to cover losses in Customer A’s
account, Gain UK did not adequately investigate the account activity. Trading Advisor’s
fraudulent conduct caused Customer A to lose approximately $280,000 in less than two
months of trading. Gain UK earned $241,671 in connection with its failure to diligently
supervise the handling of Customer A’s account.

IV. FINDINGS OF violations
Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that, during the Relevant Period, Gain UK
violated Section 2(c)(2)(C)aii)(1)(aa) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 2(c)(2)(C) (1) (aa) (2018), and
Regulations 5.3(a)(6)(i) and 166.3, 17 C.F.R. §§ 5.3(a)(6)G), 166.3 (2019).
