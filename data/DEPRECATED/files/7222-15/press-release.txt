CFTC Orders Forex Capital Markets, LLC to Pay More Than $843,000 for Supervision and
Record-Production violations and for Violating a Previous Commission Order

Washington, DC — The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today filed and simultaneously settled
charges against Forex Capital Markets, LLC (FXCM), a registered Futures Commission Merchant, for failing to diligently
supervise its officers’, employees’, and agents’ handling of accounts held at FXCM in the name of a fraudulent foreign
currency exchange pool, Revelation Forex Fund, LP (RFF). RFF was operated by Kevin G. White (White) and two
entities he controlled (the White Entities).

The CFTC sued White and the White Entities on July 9, 2013, for their fraudulent scheme (see CFTC Press Release 6644-
13, July 12, 2013) and subsequently entered into a Consent Order for permanent injunction against them (see CFTC Press
Release 7151-15, April 6, 2015). In a related criminal action, White was sentenced to over eight years of prison for mail
fraud (see CFTC Press Release 7127-15, February 26, 2015).

According to the CFTC’s Order, from April 1, 2013, to July 10, 2013, FXCM failed to follow its compliance procedures that
require that it “know all of its customers” and that its employees identify and promptly report suspicious activities to
appropriate authorities. Although FXCM was aware of warning signs that RFF was a fraud, FXCM failed to identify or
report these warning signs in violations of its own compliance procedures, or that White’s operation of websites on behalf
of the White Entities violated their exemption from registering as a commodity pool operator. The Order also finds that
FXCM failed to respond fully to a CFTC document request and, in doing so, violated a previous Commission order.

The CFTC Order requires FXCM to pay a civil monetary penalty of $700,000; disgorge commissions and fees of
$143,922.50 it earned from the RFF accounts; and comply with certain undertakings including hiring a third-party
compliance consultant to review and report on the supervisory issues raised in the Order.

The CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Harry E. Wedewer, Dmitriy Vilenskiy, John
Einstman, and Paul G. Hayeck.
