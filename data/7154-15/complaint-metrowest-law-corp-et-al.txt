COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF
AND CIVIL MONETARY PENALTIES UNDER THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT

The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC” or “Commission”), by and

through its attorneys, hereby alleges as follows:
I. SUMMARY

l. Over a period of seven consecutive trading dates from January 28, 2014 to
February 5, 2014 (“Relevant Period”), Defendants Matthew J. Marcus (“Marcus”) and John D.
Briner (“Briner”) engaged in 624 round-turn trades involving 1,248 perfectly matched, pre-
arranged, non-competitive transactions in single stock futures (“SSF”) contracts listed on
OneChicago LLC (“OneChicago”) to move at least $390,000 from Defendant MetroWest Law
Corporation (“MetroWest”) to Defendant Tech Power Inc. (“Tech Power”) (the two individuals
and two corporations, collectively, “Defendants”), By structuring the transactions such that Tech

Power would buy at lower prices and sell at higher prices opposite MetroWest, Defendants were
Case: 1:15-cv-03307 Document #: 1 Filed: 04/14/15 Page 2 of 13 PagelD #:2

able to ensure that Tech Power would always profit from the transactions, enabling the
Defendants to conduct a “money pass” between the two accounts.

2. By virtue of this conduct and the conduct further described herein, Defendants
have engaged, are engaging or are about to engage in conduct in violation of (i) Section 4c(a) of
the Commodity Exchange Act (“Act”), 7 U.S.C. § 6c(a) (2012), by entering into transactions that
are pre-arranged, fictitious sales, and/or wash sales involving the purchase or sale of
commodities for future delivery and (ii) Regulation 1.38(a), 17.C.F.R. § 1.38(a)(2014), by
entering into illegal, non-competitive transactions to buy and sell futures contracts.

3. Unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, Defendants are likely to continue to
engage in the acts and practices alleged in this Complaint and in similar acts and practices, as
more fully described below.

4, Accordingly, pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1 (2012), the
Commission brings this action to enjoin such acts and practices, prevent the dissipation of assets,
and compel compliance with the provisions of the Act. In addition, the Commission seeks civil
penalties and remedial ancillary relief, including but not limited to, trading bans, restitution,
disgorgement, an accounting, pre and post-judgment interest and such other statutory and
equitable relief as the Court may deem necessary or appropriate under the circumstances.

Il. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

5. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 6c(a) of the Act,
7 U.S.C. § 13a-1(a). Section 6c(a) of the Act authorizes the CFTC to seek injunctive relief
against any person whenever it shall appear to the CFTC that such person has engaged, is
engaging or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a violation of any provision of

the Act or any rule, regulation or order promulgated thereunder.
Case: 1:15-cv-03307 Document #: 1 Filed: 04/14/15 Page 3 of 13 PagelD #:3

6. Venue properly lies with this Court pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
§ 13a-1(e) (2012), because Defendants transacted business in this District, and the acts and
practices in violation of the Act have occurred, are occurring or are about to occur within this
District.
I. THE PARTIES

7. Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an independent federal
regulatory agency that is charged by Congress with administering and enforcing the provisions
of the Act (2012) and the Commission Regulations promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. §§ 1.1 e¢
seq. (2014).

8. Defendant Matthew J. Marcus (“Marcus”) is an individual residing in
California. Marcus serves as the President, Secretary, Treasurer and Director of Tech Power Inc.
Marcus has never been registered with the Commission in any capacity. Marcus was a client of
MetroWest Law Corporation and Briner.

9. Defendant Tech Power Inc. (“Tech Power”) is an information technology
company incorporated in Nevada and located in California. It has never been registered with the
Commission in any capacity.

10. Defendant John D. Briner (“Briner”) is an attorney residing in Vancouver,
Canada. Briner has never been registered with the Commission in any capacity. Briner owns
100% of MetroWest Law Corporation and is its principal.

It. | Defendant MetroWest Law Corporation (“MetroWest”) is a Canadian law
firm located in Vancouver, Canada. It has never been registered with the Commission in any
capacity. In October 2013 MetroWest was placed into custodianship by the Law Society of
British Columbia, which thereby assumed responsibility for MetroWest’s law practice; however,

Briner retained control over a MetroWest trading account -- account number XXXX7543.

IV. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

A. Single Stock Futures Trading on OneChicago

12. OneChicago LLC (“OneChicago”) is a designated contract market located in
Chicago, Illinois that provides a marketplace for trading security futures products, such as single
stock futures.

13. OneChicago offers an electronic trading platform in which traders place various
orders for single stock futures in its central limit order book, and OneChicago’s matching engine
arranges trades using those orders.

14. A single stock future (“SSF”) is a contract for future delivery of 100 shares of a
single stock (such as Microsoft or Netflix) that may be settled through delivery of the underlying
securities on a certain delivery date. At the expiration of the contract, the person who is “short”
the SSF delivers the underlying stock to his counterparty, who is “long” the SSF, if he holds the
contract at expiration. A trader may hold an SSF position until the delivery date or may close
out the position at any time with an offsetting transaction in the same contract. A SSF is a form
of “security future,” as defined in Section 1a(44) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 1a(44), and is subject to
joint regulation by the CFTC and the SEC under Section 2(a)(1)(D) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C.

§ 2(a)(1)(D) (2012).

15. Generally, futures markets are price discovery markets that provide a centralized
marketplace where traders can shift risk. Price discovery occurs through the open and
competitive execution of trades on the centralized market. To protect the integrity of the price
discovery process, the Act and Regulations generally require offers to be open and available to
the market as a whole (i.¢., potentially matched with any other offer). The Act and Regulations
prohibit trading practices that undermine the price discovery process, such as pre-arranged

trading or fictitious sales.
Case: 1:15-cv-03307 Document #: 1 Filed: 04/14/15 Page 5 of 13 PagelD #:5

B. Defendants’ Trading Accounts

16. Defendants carried out their scheme on OneChicago using two trading accounts
held at the same registered futures commission merchant (“FCM”).

17. _ Briner opened a trading account at an FCM in the name of MetroWest Law Corp.
in June 2012, and its account number was XXXX7543 (“MetroWest 7543”). Briner had a
unique user name and password that allowed him to control trading within MetroWest 7543.

18. According to account documentation, Briner was the only authorized trader for
MetroWest 7543, and statements for MetroWest 7543 were sent to Briner via email.

19. In connection with opening MetroWest 7543, Briner signed the FCM’s customer
agreement on June 11, 2012, affirming that Briner would be responsible for all orders entered
using his user name and password. Briner also represented that he would not permit any other
person to have access to the MetroWest 7543 account for any purpose, unless specified to the
FCM and agreed to by the FCM.

20.  Briner made several deposits into MetroWest 7543 throughout 2012 from an
account in the name of MetroWest Law Corporation Trust A. These deposits totaled in excess of
$390,000.

21. | On information and belief, Briner funded the account with money received from
one or more clients of MetroWest. Prior to January 28, 2014, MetroWest 7543 had never placed
an order on OneChicago.

22. On January 25, 2013, Marcus opened a trading account with the same FCM in the
name of Tech Power Inc., and its account number was XXXX0560 (“Tech Power 0560”).

23. According to account documentation, Marcus was the only authorized trader for
Tech Power 0560. Marcus had a unique ID and password that allowed him to control trading

within Tech Power 0560.
Case: 1:15-cv-03307 Document #: 1 Filed: 04/14/15 Page 6 of 13 PagelD #:6

24. ‘In connection with opening Tech Power 0560, Marcus signed the FCM’s
customer agreement on January 25, 2013, affirming that Marcus would be responsible for all
orders entered using his user name and password. Marcus also represented that he would not
permit any other person to have access to the Tech Power 0560 account for any purpose, unless
specified to the FCM and agreed to by the FCM.

25. Prior to January 28, 2014, Tech Power 0560 had never placed an order on
OneChicago.

C. Defendants’ Scheme to Pass Money Through SSF Trading

26. |Amoney pass is a form of non-competitive trading in which one trader
intentionally loses money to another trader, typically where one trader buys a quantity of
contracts at a high price opposite the other trader, and sells back the same quantity of contracts at
a low price opposite the same trader, leaving neither trader with a resulting futures or options
position (i.e., a “round turn”). What appears to the market to be a legitimate trade between two
arm’s-length parties is instead a pre-arranged scheme to move money from one account to the
other.

27. Beginning on January 28, 2014 and continuing for seven consecutive trading
dates through February 5, 2014, Defendants carried out a money pass scheme whereby they
moved money from MetroWest to Tech Power through a series of transactions using SSF
contracts on OneChicago. |

28. —_In each of those transactions, one of the accounts would place a limit order to buy
a specific quantity of SSF for a specific price. Immediately following that order, the other
account would enter the market with a limit order to sell the exact same quantity of SSF at an

identical price. After their orders were matched in one transaction, Defendants would later enter
Case: 1:15-cv-03307 Document #: 1 Filed: 04/14/15 Page 7 of 13 PagelD #:7

into an equal and offsetting transaction to close out the position. This pattern was repeated
hundreds of times throughout the Relevant Period.

29.‘ For example, January 28, 2014 Tech Power 0560 placed a limit order to buy one
lot of MYGNID (March expiry) at 12:46:19pm at a price of $24.97. At 12:46:29pm MetroWest
7543 entered a limit order to sell one lot of MYGNID (March expiry) at a price of $24.97. The
orders were matched, and the trade was executed at 12:46:29pm. The accounts reversed
positions 36 minutes later. At 1:22:31pm Tech Power 0560 entered a limit order to sell one lot
of MYGNI1D (March expiry) at a price of $25.42, and at 1:22:39 MetroWest 7543 placed a limit
order to buy one lot of MYGNID (March expiry) at a price of $25.42. The orders were matched,
and the trade was executed at 1:22:39pm. In this transaction, Tech Power 0560 gained $45.00.

30. Using this methodology, Defendants traded almost exclusively against each other
on OneChicago. By placing nearly simultaneous, matching orders and trading in illiquid SSF
products, Defendants virtually eliminated the possibility of trading with any other counterparty.
During the Relevant Period, Defendants’ transactions constituted approximately 98 percent of all
trades in eight SSF products.

31. | MetroWest 7543 executed a total of 1,248 SSF trades opposite of Tech Power
0560 on OneChicago, resulting in 624 round turn trades. Each time a position was closed out, it
resulted in a loss to MetroWest 7543 and a gain to Tech Power 0560. As a result, MetroWest
transferred at least $390,000 to Tech Power.

32. Defendants did not execute these trades in accordance with OneChicago’s written

rules.
Case: 1:15-cv-03307 Document #: 1 Filed: 04/14/15 Page 8 of 13 PagelD #:8

33. Defendants intended these transactions to appear as arm’s-length transactions to
the market but, instead, they were part of a scheme to pass over $390,000 from MetroWest 7543
to Tech Power 0560.
