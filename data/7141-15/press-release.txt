CFTC Revokes Registrations of John G. Wilkins and His Company, Altamont Global Partners
LLC, Based on Federal Court’s Permanent Injunction Order and on Wilkins’s Related
Criminal Conviction

Washington, DC—The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced the revocation of the
registrations of Altamont Global Partners LLC (AGP) of Longwood, Florida and its owner, John G. Wilkins, formerly of
Chuluota, Florida. AGP was registered with the CFTC as a Commodity Pool Operator, and Wilkins was registered as an
Associated Person of AGP.

The CFTC initiated revocation proceedings against AGP and Wilkins on November 25, 2014 (see CFTC Press Release
7069-14, November 25, 2014). After AGP and Wilkins failed to participate in the proceedings, CFTC Judgment Officer
Philip V. McGuire issued an Initial Decision on Default (see CFTC Docket No. SD 15-01) on February 23, 2015. The
Judgment Officer found that AGP and Wilkins are subject to statutory disqualification from CFTC registration based on an
Order for entry of default judgment and an amended Order of permanent injunction entered by the U.S. District Court for
the Middle District of Florida that, among other things, (1) found AGP and Wilkins committed fraud by misappropriating
commodity pool funds and by delivering false quarterly account statements to pool participants and (2) enjoined AGP and
Wilkins from further violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act, as charged, and from trading
or applying for registration with the CFTC (see CFTC Press Release 6869-14, February 28, 2014).

The Judgment Officer also found that Wilkins is subject to statutory disqualification based on his felony conviction for
conspiracy to commit mail fraud and wire fraud in connection with these same activities (see United States v. Wilkins, No.
13-cr-181 (M.D. Fla. July 19, 2013)).

The Judgment Officer’s Initial Decision on Default became a final Order of the CFTC on March 25, 2015.
The CFTC thanks the National Futures Association for its assistance in this matter.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Rachel Hayes, Peter Riggs, and Charles
Marvine.
