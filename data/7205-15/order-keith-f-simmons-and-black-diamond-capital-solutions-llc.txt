2, Settling Defendants Fraudulently Solicited Customers to Trade Forex
Through Black Diamond

18, From at least April 2007 through at least December 2009 (‘‘relevant period”),
Simmons, Individual 1, Individual 2, and Individual 3, acting through various corporate entities,
fraudulently solicited and/or accepted at least $35 million from at least 240 customers for the

putported purpose of trading, via the Black Diamond trading platform, a pooled investment in

connection with agreements, contracts, of transactions in off-exchange foreign currency
(“forex”) that are margined or leveraged.

19, At least certain of these customers, if not all, were individuals who had total
assets of less than $5 million.

20, Simmons first solicited Individual | to invest in forex through BDCS in April
2007, and subsequently entered into a joint venture with Individual 1 whereby she, acting
through her own corporate entity, would market forex trading through BDCS to her customers,
Simmons and Individual 1 would then split equally the joint venture’s share of profits achieved
by any new customers brought to BDCS by Individual 1.

21. Simmons and Individual 1 subsequently solicited Individual 2 to invest in forex
through BDCS in October 2007, and then entered into a three-way joint venture with Individual
2, whereby he, acting through his own corporate entity, would market forex trading through
BDCS to his customers, Simmons, Individval 1, and Individual 2 would then split in equal thirds
the new joint venture’s share of profits achieved by any new customers brought to BDCS by
Individual 2.

22, According to the joint venture agreement, the joint venture was to be conducted
under the name BDCS; but later Simmons, Individual 1, and Individual 2 changed the name to
Black Diamond Holdings (“BD Holdings”), Regardless, Simmons, Individual 1, and Individual
2 continued to use the names BDCS, BD Holdings, and Black Diamond interchangeably in their
forex materials, solicitations, and communications with customers.

23. Simmons, Individual 1, and Individual 2 jointly developed Black Diamond
solicitation materials and provided them to the persons and entities they solicited. The Black

Diamond solicitation materials used by Simmons, Individual t, and Individual 2 claimed that

Case a1 1- 023-RIC-DCK Document isi Filed 06/24/15 Page Gof 20

 

 

 
Black Diamond offered customers exclusive access to an automatic computerized trading system
created by a group of software developers to trade forex, that the system had been trading forex
for over 36 months, and that every month had exceeded the target of four percent gain per
month, One version of the materials purported to show an actual three year trading history with
consistently positive monthly returns, often in excess of ten percent, and a three year balance
reflecting results of $194,340.37 on an initial $5,000 investment,

24, The Black Diamond solicitation materials assured customers that the risk of
trading forex through Black Diamond was limited because automatic stop loss mechanisms
would kick in should a customer’s account ever drop ten petcent (or, in some later versions,
twenty percent) and would prevent any further trading without specific instructions from the
customer. In addition, the materials assured customers that Black Diamond had no right to
deplete or withdraw customer funds at any time other than for the purpose of engaging in actual
trading,

25,  Toexpand the reach of the Black Diamond scheme even farther, Individual 1
etitered into “Co-Facilitator Agreements” with certain of her customers, These agreements
authorized others, so-called “Facilitators,” to solicit customers to trade forex through BDCS in
exchange for a marketing service fee. Ifa Facilitator successfully solicited a customer to trade
through BDCS, then Simmons and Individual 1 would further divide their portion of the
customet’s trading profits with the referring Facilitator, As a result of these Co-Facilitator
agreetnents, the Black Diamond fraudulent scheme was extended to numerous
individuals/entities across California, Colorado, Texas, and other states,

26. Individual 2 initially solicited customers as a Facilitator for Individual 1 pursuant

to the Simmons-Individual 1 joint venture. By December 2007, after the Simmons-Individual 1-

Individual 2 joint venture was formed, Individual 2, acting through his own corporate entity,
began soliciting customers to trade forex through Black Diamond pursuant to the joint venture
agreement. By June 2008, Individual 2 established his own hedge fund to be the vehicle through
which he solicited customers for Black Diamond.

27, — In December 2007, Individual 2 solicited Individual 3 to open a forex trading
account with Black Diamond on behalf of the customers of Individual 3’s fund, Individual 2
also recruited individuals to create and manage “Hedge Funds” in order to solicit additional
customers for the Black Diamond scheme. As a result of these Hedge Funds, the Black
Diamond scheme was extended to numerous individuals/entities across the United States.

3. ‘Settling Defendants Misappropriated Customer Funds

28, Simmons never engaged in any trading of forex on behalf of Black Diamond.
customers, In fact, the so-called system developers and the Black Diamond trading platform
never existed, Instead of investing customer funds into a forex trading platform operated by
Black Diamond as promised, Simmons misappropriated those funds to pay purported profits or
to return ptincipal to Black Diamond customers. These payments accounted for at least half of
the money brought in to Black Diamond, or approximately $19 million. .

29, Simmons also used at least $5.8 million in Black Diamond funds for cash
withdrawals or to finance personal expenses for such things as real estate purchases and
improvements, cars and lavish trips. In addition, Simmons used at least $2 million of Black
Diamond customer funds to start, advertise, and operate several side businesses, These side

businesses were untelated to the forex trading purportedly taking place through Black Diamond,

4, Settling Defendants Concealed Their Misappropriation With False Account
Statements and Misrepresentations

30. To conceal the lack of trading and the misappropriation of customer funds,
Simmons caused to be issued through Individual 1, Individual 2, Individual 3, and other Black
Diamond agents false monthly account statements to customers consistently showing
overwhelmingly positive returns from their alleged forex trading, In fact, Black Diamond never
reported a losing month, Simmons prepated or reviewed some or ail of these account statements
- before issuing them to customers, then delivered, or caused to be delivered, and/or reported the

results of such statements to customers. Relying on the consistently profitable monthly account
statements, existing customers decided to remain invested in Black Diamond and, in some cases,
invested additional funds into Black Diamond, Additionally, prospective customers made the
decision to invest in forex trading through Black Diamond after hearing of the consistently
profitable monthly returns to existing customers,

31, By eatly 2009, Black Diamond and Simmons had insufficient funds to continue
paying out customer withdrawal requests, Despite their lack of trading and lack of funds to meet
customer demands, Black Diamond and Simmons continued to accept, and Individual 1,
Individual 2, and Individual 3 continued to send, or caused to be sent, on behalf of their

customers, additional funds from current customers as well as funds from new customers in an
apparent effort to keep the fraudulent scheme going,

32, On March 19, 2009, Simmons sent an email to Individual {, stating that Black
Diamond would be shutting down for restructuring and, therefore, would be liquidating all
customer accounts, In the email, Simmons also stated that all accounts, including all forex
trading gains, would be paid out. At that point, however, there was only approximately $600,000°

remaining in the Black Diamond bank accounts. The alleged plan for yestructuring was the first

Case S11- 023-RIC-DCRK Document isi Filed 06/24/15 Page Saf 20

 

 

 
in a series of excuses created by Simmons, which were repeated by — and, in some instances,
crafted with the aid of ~ Individual 1, Individual 2, and Individual 3 to their customers to explain
the failure to return funds to customers, These excuses included, but were not limited to, claims
that: (1) the restructuring of Black Diamond required several accounting reviews and multiple
paymasters and accountants before funds could be returned; (2) excessive withdrawal requests by
customers were causing delays in the return of funds; (3) a non-existent German liquidity
provider by the name of Klaus was attempting to provide $120 million to Black Diamond to
payout customers and replace Black Diamond on the purported platform, but his alleged transfer
of funds was frozen by bank or regulatory procedures; (4) other bank interventions, such as
banking requirements and restrictions, caused the Black Diamond accounts to be frozen; and (5)
regulatory interventions by the Federal Reserve, the Treasury Department and the CFTC, for
reasons unrelated to the operations of Black Diamond, purportedly resulted in the freezing of
their funds,

33,  Evenas the excuses propounded by Simmons became more complex and
outrageous, Individual 1, Individual 2, and Individual 3 continued to forward these excuses to
their customers as if they were their own or as if they had full knowledge of what was alleged in
the excuses, Simmons, in an instant message exchange with Individual 1 in July 2009, worked
with Individual 1 to draft the excuse they would provide to customers regarding the closing of
Black Diamond and the unavailability of funds for withdrawals. Simmons also worked with
Individual 2 on an exeuse that Individual 2 subsequently provided to his customers,

34, Simmons and Individual 2 threatened customers with additional delays in fund
distribution if they attempted to interfere in the payout process or spoke to any financial .

regulators. Simmons also threatened certain customers that if they contacted the alleged

paymaster, Black Diamond would lose access to the paymaster services and the payout to
customers would be jeopardized,

35, Simmons also provided to certain customers a list of real estate investments,
claiming that these properties were security for the funds allegedly being traded in forex through
Black Diamond, Simmons failed to disclose to these customers that these properties were
purchased with misappropriated Black Diamond customer funds and the value of the real estate
listed was insufficient to be adequate security for the funds seut in to Black Diamond, let alone
any of the alleged forex trading gains,

36. To further conceal and perpetuate the fraud and ease customer concerns, Simmons
falsely informed certain customers on several occasions that Black Diamond held approximately
$77 million in U.S, Treasury Notes in an account at JPMorgan Chase Bank, Simmons attempted
to prove the existence of the $77 million by altering a JPMorgan Chase bank document from an

, account belonging to another entity (not owned by Simmons) to reflect this fictitious balance of
$77 million, In fact, neither Black Diamond nor Simmons held any such account at JPMorgan
Chase.

37, Despite the complete lack of trading and mote than eight months of delays in
returning the unaccounted-for funds, Simmons, Individual 1, Individual 2, and Individual 3 still
claimed to Black Diamond customers, through at least December 2009, that their funds would be
returned. Throughout this time, Simmons, Individual 1, Individual 2, and Individual 3 continued
to issue, or caused to be issued, to Black Diamond customers monthly account statements

through November 2009 showing profitable results from Black Diamond’s alleged forex trading,

5. Simmons Controlled BDCS and Was Tis Agent

38, During the relevant period, Simmons held himself out as the principal of BDCS
and in various documents and communications he was described as the owner and operator of
BDCS. He controlled the bank accounts opened and maintained in the name of BDCS, He also
was responsible for computing the monthly percentage return on the purported forex trading that
was used to calculate the gains on Black Diamond customers’ accounts.

2s Violation of Sections 4b(a)(2)(A)-(C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. §§ 6b(a)(2)(A)-
(C) (2012): Fraud in Connection with Forex Transactions .

42. Simmons and BDCS entered into transactions in foreign currency with persons
who were not “eligible contract participants” as that term is defined in Section 1a(12)(A)(xi) of
the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 1a(12)(A)(xi) (2012); therefore, pursuant to Section 2(e)2)(C) (iv) of the Act,
TUS.C, § 2(c)(2)\(C)Giv) (2012), Sections 4b(a)(2)(A)-(C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. §§ 6b(a)(2)(A)-
(C) (2012), apply to Simmons’s and BDCS’s foreign currency transactions “as if” they were 4

43, By the conduct described in paragraphs 18 through 38 above, Simmons and
BDCS cheated or defrauded, or attempted to cheat ot defraud, customers or prospective

willfully deceived or attempted to deceive customers or prospective customers by, among other
things, knowingly or recklessly (1) fraudulently soliciting customers and prospective customers

funds on hand to return all of their customers’ principal, all in violation of Sections 4b(a)(2)(A)-
(C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C, §§ 6b(a)(2)(A)-(C) (2012).

44, Simmons controlled BDCS, directly or indirectly, and did not act in good faith or

knowingly induced, directly or indirectly, BDCS’s acts in violation of the Act; therefore,

pursuant to Section 13(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 13c(b) (2012), Simmons is liable for BDCS’s
violations of Sections 4b(a)(2)(A)-(C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. §§ 6b(a)(2)(A)-(C) (2012),

45, The foregoing acts, omissions, and failures of Simmons occurred within the scope
of his employment, office, or agency with BDCS; therefore, pursuant to Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the
Act, 7 U.S.C. § 2(a)(1)(B) (2012), and Regulation 1.2, 17 C.F.R. § 1.2 (2013), BDCS is liable
for Simmons’s acts, omissions, and failures in violation of Sections 4b(a)(2)(A)-(C) of the Act, 7
U.S.C. §§ 6b(a)(2)(A)-(C) (2012).
