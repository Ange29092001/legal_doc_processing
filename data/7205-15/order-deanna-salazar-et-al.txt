2. Settling Defendants Fraudulently Solicited Customers to Trade Forex
Through Black Diamond

19, From at least April 2007 through at least December 2009 (“relevant period”),
Salazat, Individual 1, Individual 2, and Individual 3, acting through various corporate entities,
fraudulently solicited and/or accepted at least $35 milllon from at least 240 customers for the
purported purpose of trading, via the Black Diamond trading platform, a pooled investment in
connection with agreements, contracts, ot transactions in off-exchange foreign currency
(“forex”) that are margined or leveraged.

20, At least certain of these customers, if not all, were Individuals who had total
assets of loss than $5 million.

21. Individual | first solicited Salazar to invest in forex through Black Diamond
Capital Solutions, L.L.C. (“BDCS8”) in April 2007, and subsequently entered Into a joint venture
with Salazar whereby she, acting through her company Life Plus, would market forex trading
through BDCS to her customers, Individual 1 and Salazar would then split equally the joint
venture’s share of profits achieved by any new customers brought to BDCS by Salazar.

22,. Individual 4 and Salazar subsequently solicited Individual 2 to invest in forex
through BDCS in October 2007, and then entered into a three-way joint venture with Individual

2, whereby he, acting through his own corporate entity, would market forex trading through

 
 

1-cv-00023-RJC-DCK Document 112-1 Filed 12/02/14 Page 6 of 22h
1 023-RIC-DCK Document ise Filed 06/24/15 Page 6 of 22

 

 
BDCS to his customers, Individual 1, Salazar, and Individual 2 would then split in equal thirds
the new joint venture’s share of profits achieved by any new customers brought to BDCS by
Individual 2.

23, According to the joint venture agreement, the joint venture was to be conducted
under the name BDCS; but later Individual 1, Salazar, and Individual 2 changed the name to
Black Diamond Holdings (“BD Holdings”), Regardless, Individual 1, Salazar, and Individual 2
continued to use the names BDCS, BD Holdings, and Black Diamond interchangeably in their
forex materials, solicitations, and communications with customers.

24, ° Individual 1, Salazar, and Individual 2 jointly developed Black Diamond
solloitation materials and provided them to the persons and entities they solicited. The Black
Diamond solicitation materials used by Individual 1, Salazar, and Individual 2 claimed that
Black Diamond offered customers exclusive access to an automatic computerized trading system
oreated by a group of software developers to trade forex, that the system had been trading forex
for over 36 months, and that every month had exceeded the target of four percent gain per
‘month, One version of the materials purported to show an actual three year trading history with
consistently positive monthly returns, often in excess of ten percent, and a three year balance
reflecting results of $194,340.37 on an initial $5,000 investment,

25, The Black Diamond solicitation materials assured customers that the tisk of
trading forex through Black Diamond was limited because automatic stop loss mechanisms
would kick in should a customer’s account ever drop ten percent (or, in some later versions,
twenty percent) and would prevent any further trading without specific instructions from the

customer, In addition, the materials assured customers that Black Diamond had no ti ight to

Case Silb-cy-00023-RIC-DCK Document i322 Filed 06/24/15 Page 7 abZ2¥

 

 
deplete or withdraw customer funds at any time other than for the purpose of erigaging In actual

trading.

 

26.  Toexpand the reach of the Black Diamond scheme even farther, Salazar entered
into “Co-Facilitator Agreements” with certain of her customers, These agreements authorized
others, so-called “Facilitators,” to solicit customers to trade forex through BDCS in exchange for
amarketing service fee, Ifa Facilitator successfully solicited a customer to trade through BDCS,
then Individual 1 and Salazar would further divide their portion of the customer’s trading profits i
with the referring Facilitator, As a result of these Co-Facilitator agreements, the Black Diamond
fraudulent scheme was extended to numerous individuals/entities across Callfornia, Colorado,
Texas, and other states,

27, — Inaddition to the Black Diamond solicitation material described above, Salazar,
directly ot through her Facilitators, provided customers with a one-page trading agreement to
sign. The trading agreement provided that customers would participate with both BDCS and
Life Plus in a forex trading account held by BDCS at a third party brokerage, and provided for a
percentage split (usually ranging from 50/50 to 60/40) of net profits between the account holder
and Black Diamond/Life Plus, Salazar signed many, if not most, of these agreements as an
officer of Black Diamond and Life Plus, Many, if not most, of Salazar’s customers also
completed an account information form wherein Salazar’s name appeared on the signature line
as an officer of Black Diamond as well as Life Plus,

3, Settling Defendants Misappropriated Customer Funds

28, The funds of the customers solicited by Salazar for investment with Black

._Diamond were deposited either directly into bank accounts in the name of BDCS controlled by

Individual 1 or into bank accounts in the name of Salazar and/or Life Plus, In the latter case,

Case 3:11-cv-00023-RJC-DCK Document 112-1 Filed 12/02/14 Page 8 of 22 :
Case G1 1-cv-h023-RIC-DCK Document 132 Filed 06/24/15 Page 8 af 2:

 

 

 
Salazat then either wired the funds directly to bank accounts in the name of BDCS controlled by
Individual 1, ov had Individual 1 or agents of Black Diamond create bookkeeping records to
reflect fictitious transfers of funds from Salazar’s Black Diamond trading account to the
customer’s Black Diamond trading account. Funds flowed back from BDCS bank accounts
either directly to Salazar’s customers ot through bank accounts in the name of Salazar and/or
Life Plus.

29, Individual 1 never engaged in any trading of forex on behalf of Black Diamond
customers, In fact, the so-called system developers and the Black Diamond trading platform
never existed, Instead of investing customer finds Into a forex trading platform operated by
Black Diamond as promised, Individual 1 misappropriated those funds to pay purported profits
or to return principal to Black Diamond customers, These payments accounted for at least half
of the money brought in to Black Diamond, or approximately $19 million,

30. Individual also used at least $5.8 million in Black Diamond funds for cash
withdrawals or to finanee personal expenses for such things as teal estate purchases and
improvements, cars and lavish trips, In addition, Individual 1 used at least $2 million of Black
Diamond customer finds to start, advertise, and operate several side businesses, These side
businesses were unrelated to the forex trading purportedly taking place through Black Diamond,

31,  Salazar’s customers invested more than $7 million for the purpose of trading
forex through Black Diamond, Of the more than $2 rnillion Salazar received directly from
customers, Salazar failed to send to Black Diamond approximately $1.5 million. Instead, she
made or caused to be made bookkeeping transactions representing these customer deposits, with
no actual transfer of funds taking place, keeping the aotual funds for her personal use,

Additionally, Salazar received more than $1.9 million in customer funds from Black Diamond,

returned only approximately $600,000 to enstomers, and kept the remalning approximately $1.3
million for her personal use,
32. Salazar used the approximately $2.8 mi{llon in misappropriated Black Diamond
customer funds for, among other things, expensive personal trips and the purchase of more than
$400,000 worth of vehioles,

4, Settling Defendants Concealed Theiy Misappropriation With False Account
Statements and Misvepresentations

' 33, ‘To conceal! the lack of trading and the misappropriation of customer funds,
Individual 1 caused to be issued through Salazar and other Black Diamond agents false monthly
account statements to customers consistently showing overwhelmingly positive returns from
their alleged forex trading, In fact, Black Diamond never reported a losing month. Salazar
prepared or reviewed some or all of these account statements before issuing them to her

customers, then delivered, or caused to be delivered, and/or reported the results of such

 

statements to her customers. Relying on the consistently profitable monthly account statements,
Salazar’s existing customers decided to remain invested and, in some cases, invested additional
funds through Salazar. Additionally, prospective customers made the decision to invest in forex
trading through Black Diarnond through Salazar after hearing of the consistently profitable
monthly returns fo existing customers,

34. By satly 2009, Black Diamond and Individual 1 had insufficient funds to continue
paying out customer withdrawal requests. Despite their lack of trading and lack of funds to meet
customer demands, Black Diamond and Individual 1 continued to accept, and Salazar continued
to send, of caused to be sent, on behalf of her customers, additional finds from current customers

as well as funds from new customers in an apparent effort to keep the fraudulent scheme going,

35, On March 19, 2009, Individual 1 sent an email to Salazar stating that Black
Diamond would be shutting down for restructuring and, therefore, would be liquidating all
customer accounts. In the email, Individual 1 also stated that all accounts, including all forex
trading gains, would be paid out. At that point, however, there was only approximately $600,000
remaining in the Black Diamond bank accounts, The alleged plan for restructuring was the first
in a sories of excuses created by Individual 1, which were repeated by — and, in some instances,
crafted with the aid of — Salazar to her customers to explain the failure to return funds to
customers, These excuses included, but were not limited to, claims that: (1) the restructuring of
Black Diamond required several accounting reviews and multiple paymasters and accountants
before funds could be returned; (2) excessive withdrawal requests by customers were causing
delays in the return of funds; (3) a non-existent German liquidity provider by the name of Klaus
was attempting to provide $120 million to Black Diamond to payout customers and replace
Black Diamond on the purported platform, buthis alleged transfer of funds was frozen by bank
or regulatory procedures; (4) other bank interventions, such as banking requirements and
restrictions, caused the Black Diamond accounts to be frozen; and (5) regulatory interventions by
the Federal Reserve, the Treasury Department and the CFTC, for reasons unrelated to the
operations of Black Diamond, purportedly resulted in the freezing of their funds,

36, Even as the excuses propounded by Individual 1 became more complex and
outrageous, Salazar continued to forward these exonses to her customers as if they were her own
or as if she had full knowledge of what was alleged in the excuses, Salazar, for example, made
numerous assurances to her customers that a payout by Black Diamond would ocour, resulting in
a fill return to customers of their principal and interest from their Black Diamond investment, In

fact, Salazar, in an instant message exchange with Individual 1 in July 2009, wotked with

Individual 1 to draft the excuse they would provide to customers regarding the closing of Black

Diamond and the unavailability of funds for withdrawals.

37, Despite the complete lack of trading and more than eight months of delays in
returning the unaecounted-for funds, Salazar still claimed to her customers, through at least
December 2009, that their funds would be returned. Throughout this time, Salazar continued to
issue, or caused to be issued, to her customers monthly account statements through November
2009 showing profitable results from Black Diamond’s alleged forex trading,

5. Settling Defendants Continued to Misappropriate Funds Even Whon They
Knew Black Diamond Could Not Make Customer Payouts

38. Even months after Black Diamond was unable to make any customer payouts,

Salazat continued to accept additional funds for investment in Black Diamond and never sent, or

 

caused to be sent, those funds to Black Diamond for forex trading. Instead, Salazar kept, or
caused to be kept, those funds on deposit in bank accounts and did nat Inform her customers of
this fact. For example, during the summer of 2009, Salazar took in approximately $130,000 in
customer deposits intended for the purpose of trading forex through Black Diamond. ‘Salazar
never sent these funds to Black Diamond; instead, the funds were used, among other things, to
pay her personal expenses,

6. Salazar Controlled Life Plus and Was Its Agent

39. During the relevant period, Salazar held herself out as the principal of Life Plus
and was described as the owner of Life Plus in various documents and communications, She
controlled the bank accounts opened and maintained in the name of Life Plus, She solicited
customers to invest in Life Plus for the purpose of trading forex through Black Diamond. She
was also responsible for the content of the Life Plus account statements distributed to Life Plus

customers,
