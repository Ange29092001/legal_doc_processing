THE UNITED STATES CHARGES:
Introduction

At all times material to this information:

1. Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (âPDVSAâ) was the Venezuelan state-
owned and state-controlled oil company. PDVSA and its subsidiaries were
responsible for the exploration, production, refining, transportation, and trade in
energy resources in Venezuela and provided funding for other operations of the
Venezuelan government. PDVSA and its wholly owned subsidiaries were
âinstrumentalitiesâ of the Venezuelan government as that term is used in the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (âFCPAâ), Title 15, United States Code, Section
78dd-2(h)(2)(A).

2. Defendant ALFONZO ELIEZER GRAVINA MUNOZ
(âDefendant GRAVINAâ), a resident of Fort Bend County, Texas, anda

naturalized U.S. citizen since in or around 2006, was employed by PDVSA or by
 

wholly owned subsidiaries or affiliates thereof from in or around 1998 until in or
around March 2014. During that time, Defendant GRAVINA held a number of
positions related to the purchase of energy services equipment and services,
including purchasing manager. Defendant GRAVINAâs job responsibilities
included selecting companies for bidding panels, which allowed those companies
to submit bids on individual PDVSA projects. Defendant GRAVINA was a
âforeign officialâ as that term is used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code,
Section 78dd-2(h)(2)(A).

3. âBUSINESSMAN 1,â an individual whose identity is known to the
United States, was the owner of a number of U.S.-based energy companies that
supplied equipment and services to PDVSA, and a resident of Texas, and thus a
âdomestic concernâ and an officer, director, employee, agent, and shareholder of a
âdomestic concernâ as those terms are used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States
Code, Section 78dd-2(h)(1).

4. âBUSINESSMAN 2,â an individual whose identity is known to the
United States, was the owner of a number of other U.S.-based energy companies
that supplied equipment and services to PDVSA, and a resident of the United
States, and thus a âdomestic concernâ and an officer, director, employee, agent,
and shareholder of a âdomestic concernâ as those terms are used in the FCPA, Title

15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2(h)(1). BUSINESSMAN 1 and
 

BUSINESSMAN 2 worked together on a number of PDVSA contracts and

contract bids.

COUNT ONE
(18 U.S.C. Â§ 371 â Conspiracy)

5. Beginning in at least 2007 and continuing through at least 2014, the

defendant,
ALFONZO ELIEZER GRAVINA MUNOZ,

did willfully, that is, with the intent to further the objects of the conspiracy, and
knowingly conspire, confederate, and agree with others known and unknown to the
United States, including BUSINESSMAN 1 and BUSINESSMAN 2, to commit an
offense against the United States, that is, knowing that the property involved ina
financial transaction represented the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity, to
conduct financial transactions affecting interstate and foreign commerce, which
financial transactions involved the proceeds of specified unlawful activity, namely,
bribery of a foreign official, a felony violation of the FCPA, Title 15, United States
Code, Section 78dd-2, knowing that the transactions were designed in whole and in
part to conceal and disguise the nature, the location, the source, the ownership, and
the control of the proceeds of said specified unlawful activity, in violation of Title

18, United States Code, Section 1956(a)(1)(B)(i).
Purpose of the Conspiracy

6. The purpose of the conspiracy was for Defendant GRAVINA,
BUSINESSMAN 1, BUSINESSMAN 2, and their co-conspirators to engage in
financial transactions to conceal and disguise bribe payments paid to Defendant
GRAVINA, all in an effort by BUSINESSMAN 1, BUSINESSMAN 2, and their
cohorts to secretly and illegally gain an improper advantage in obtaining and
retaining lucrative energy contracts with PDVSA.

Manner and Means of the Conspiracy

7. The manner and means by which Defendant GRAVINA and his co-
conspirators sought to accomplish the purpose of the conspiracy included, among
other things, the following, while in the Southern District of Texas and elsewhere:

8. Defendant GRAVINA, together with others, including
BUSINESSMAN 1 and BUSINESSMAN 2, agreed that BUSINESSMAN I and
BUSINESSMAN 2 would pay bribes, and did in fact pay bribes, to Defendant
GRAVINA in exchange for Defendant GRAVINAâs assistance in placing
BUSINESSMAN 1âs and BUSINESSMAN 2âs companies on the bidding panels
for PDVSA projects; supporting BUSINESSMAN 1âs and BUSINESSMAN 2âs
companies before an internal purchasing committee; and providing
BUSINESSMAN 1 and BUSINESSMAN 2 with inside information about PDVSA

projects and bids.
 

 

 

9. Defendant GRAVINA, together with others, including
BUSINESSMAN I and BUSINESSMAN 2, attempted to conceal, and did in fact
conceal, the nature, source, and ownership of the bribes, which they referred to as
âcommissions,â by frequently having the bribes paid out of bank accounts
controlled by BUSINESSMAN 1 and BUSINESSMAN 2 that were in the name of
companies other than the companies for which Defendant GRAVINA helped to
secure PDVSA contracts.

10. Defendant GRAVINA, together with others, including
BUSINESSMAN | and BUSINESSMAN 2, further attempted to conceal, and did
in fact conceal, the nature, source, and ownership of the bribes by directing bribe
payments to be sent to various recipients other than himself.

11. Defendant GRAVINA, together with others, including
BUSINESSMAN 1, further attempted to conceal, and did in fact conceal, the
nature, source, and ownership of the bribes by having certain of the bribes paid
into an account held in the name of a close personal associate of Defendant
GRAVINA, but over which Defendant GRAVINA held power of attorney.

12. Defendant GRAVINA, together with others, including
BUSINESSMAN 2, further attempted to conceal, and did in fact conceal, the

nature, source, and ownership of the bribes by having certain of the bribes paid to a

COUNT TWO
(26 U.S.C. Â§ 7206(1) â Fraud and False Statements)

23. Paragraphs | through 4 and 6 through 22 are realleged and
incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein.

24. Onor about March 21, 2011, in the Southern District of Texas and
elsewhere, the defendant,

ALFONZO ELIEZER GRAVINA MUNOZ,

for the calendar year 2010, which was verified by a written declaration that it was
made under the penalties of perjury and electronically filed with the Internal
Revenue Service, which Defendant GRAVINA did not believe to be true and
correct as to every material matter, that is, said return reported $98,298 on Line 22,
Total Income, whereas Defendant GRAVINA then and there well knew and
believed that figure was a false and understated amount because it failed to report
approximately $643,140 in additional income Defendant GRAVINA had received

BUSINESSMAN 1, BUSINESSMAN 2, and other individuals and entities.

All in violation of Title 26, United States Code, Section 7206(1).
