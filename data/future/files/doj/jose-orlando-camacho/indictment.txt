At all times material to this Information:

ls Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (together with its subsidiaries and
affiliates, âPDVSAâ) was the Venezuelan state-owned and state-controlled oil
company. PDVSA was responsible for the exploration, production, refining,
transportation, and trade in energy resources in Venezuela and provided funding
for other operations of the Venezuelan government. PDVSA and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries, including BARIVEN S.A. (âBARIVENâ) were âinstrumentalitiesâ of
the Venezuelan government as that term is used in the Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act (âFCPAâ), Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2(h)(2)(A).

2. At all relevant times, Defendant JOSE ORLANDO CAMACHO
(âDefendant CAMACHOâ), a naturalized United States Citizen and resident of

Texas, was employed by PDVSA or by wholly-owned subsidiaries or affiliates
Case 4:17-cr-00394 Document1 Filed in TXSD 0n 07/05/17 Page 2 of 8

thereof from in or around 2004 until in or around November 2013. During that
time, Defendant CAMACHO held a number of positions related to procurement,
including serving as a sourcing supervisor and manager for planning and strategic
sourcing for the PDVSA procurement subsidiary in Houston, Texas responsible for
overseeing the shipping of goods to Venezuela for PDVSAâs operations.
Defendant CAMACHO âs job responsibilities included selecting companies for
bidding panels, which allowed those companies to submit bids on individual
PDVSA projects. Defendant CAMACHO was a âforeign officialâ as that term is
used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2(h)(2)(A).

3: At all relevant times, a businessman (âBUSINESSMAN Aâ) was an
owner and executive of an international logistics and freight-forwarding company
(âCOMPANY Aâ), based in the Southern District of Texas and incorporated under
the laws of the State of Texas, that supplied equipment and services to PDVSA,
and was a U.S. Lawful Permanent Resident and a resident of the State of Texas,
and thus was a âdomestic concernâ and an officer, director, employee, agent, and
shareholder of a âdomestic concernâ as those terms are used in the FCPA, Title 15,
United States Code, Section 78dd-2(h)(1). On behalf of COMPANY A,
BUSINESSMAN A worked on a number of PDVSA contracts and contract bids

for logistics and freight-forwarding.

COUNT ONE
(18 U.S.C. Â§ 371 â Conspiracy)

4. Beginning in or around 2009 and continuing through at least 2013, the

defendant,
JOSE ORLANDO CAMACHO,

did willfully, that is, with the intent to further the objects of the conspiracy, and
knowingly conspire, confederate, and agree with others known and unknown to the
United States, including BUSINESSMAN A, to commit an offense against the
United States, that is:

knowing that the property involved in the financial transaction represented
the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity, to conduct or attempt to conduct
financial transactions affecting interstate and foreign commerce, which financial
transactions involved the proceeds of specified unlawful activity, namely, bribery
of a foreign official, a felony violation of the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code,
Sections 78dd-2 and 78dd-3, knowing that the transactions were designed in whole
and in part to conceal and disguise the nature, the location, the source, the
ownership, and the control of the proceeds of said specified unlawful activity, in
violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1956(a)(1)(B)(i).

Purpose of the Conspiracy
5: The purpose of the conspiracy was for Defendant CAMACHO,

BUSINESSMAN A, and their co-conspirators to engage in financial transactions to
3
Case 4:17-cr-00394 Document1 Filed in TXSD 0n 07/05/17 Page 4 0f8

conceal and disguise bribe payments paid to Defendant CAMACHO, all in an
effort by BUSINESSMAN A and his cohorts and others to secretly and illegally
gain an improper advantage in obtaining and retaining lucrative contracts with
PDVSA.

Manner and Means of the Conspiracy

6. The manner and means by which Defendant CAMACHO and his co-
conspirators sought to accomplish the purpose of the conspiracy included, among
other things, the following, while in the Southern District of Texas and elsewhere:

7. Defendant CAMACHO, together with others, including
BUSINESSMAN A, agreed that, in exchange for Defendant CAMACHOâs
assistance in providing COMPANY A with confidential bidding information,
recommendations for the award of business, and assistance in processing lucrative
modifications of contractual terms for PDVSA contracts, BUSINESSMAN A,
COMPANY A, and others would pay bribes to Defendant CAMACHO.

8. Defendant CAMACHO, together with others, including
BUSINESSMAN A and COMPANY A, attempted to conceal, and did in fact
conceal, the nature, source, and ownership of the bribes by sometimes having the
bribes paid in cash in U.S. dollars through a relative of Defendant CAMACHO.

9. Defendant CAMACHO, together with others, including

BUSINESSMAN A and COMPANY A, attempted to conceal, and did in fact
Case 4:17-cr-00394 Document1 Filed in TXSD 0n 07/05/17 Page 50f8

conceal, the nature, source, and ownership of the bribes by sometimes having the
bribes paid in wire transfers from COMPANY Aâs Houston bank accounts to
overseas bank accounts held in the names of Defendant CAMACHOâs relatives
but controlled by Defendant CAMACHO, which payments were covered for
accounting purposes by false invoices orchestrated by BUSINESSMAN A and
COMPANY A for fictitious services. From that overseas bank account, Defendant
CAMACHO would then direct the funds for his personal use.

10. In furtherance of the conspiracy and to achieve the objects thereof, at
least one of the co-conspirators committed or caused to be committed, in the
Southern District of Texas and elsewhere, at least one of the following overt acts,
