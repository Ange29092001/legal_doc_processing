General Allegations Regarding the Conspiracy to Violate
The FCPA and the Travel Act Charged in Count One

9. From in or about November 2014 through in or about December 2015,
BAPTISTE, together with CC-1 and others known and unknown to the Grand Jury, conspired to
bribe foreign officials to obtain and retain business in connection with the Port Project. As part
of the conspiracy, BAPTISTE, CC-1 and others known and unknown to the Grand Jury solicited
bribes from two undercover agents from the FBI posing as a prospective investors for the Port
Project (âUC-1â and âUC-2â), which was expected to cost approximately $84 million, and was
to involve the construction of a cement factory in its first phase. BAPTISTE told the UCs that he
would funnel the payments to Haitian officials through Non-Profit in order to secure government
approval of the project. UC-2 ultimately wired $50,000 to Non-Profitâs bank account at
BAPTISTEâs direction. Although BAPTISTE used the $50,000 for personal uses, he intend to
use future payments from UC-2 to make bribe payments in connection with the Port Project.

Objects of the Conspiracy

10. The purpose and object of the conspiracy charged in Count One was to enrich the
co-conspirators, including BAPTISTE, by paying bribes to Haitian officials in order to obtain
and retain business for BAPTISTE, CC-1, Company, Non-Profit, and others in connection with
the Port Project.

Manner and Means
11. The manner and means by which the defendant, BAPTISTE, together with CC-1

violate the FCPA and the Travel Act charged in Count One included, among other things, the

following:

BAPTISTE traveled from Maryland to Boston, Massachusetts, and CC-1
traveled from outside the United States to Boston, Massachusetts, to meet with
and solicit potential investors for the Port Project and to discuss bribe payments
that would have to be made in connection with the Port Project.

BAPTISTE offered to use Non-Profit as a conduit for bribe payments from
potential investors that needed to be made in connection with the Port Project, in
order to conceal the true nature of the funds.

BAPTISTE, CC-1, and others used telephones, text messages, and email to
discuss bribe payments that needed to be made, and other things of value that
needed to be provided, to foreign officials, including Foreign Official-1 and
Aide-1, in connection with the Port Project.

BAPTISTE provided UC-2 account and routing numbers for Non-Profitâs bank â
account, so that UC-2 could wire money that BAPTISTE could purportedly use
to pay bribes to foreign officials in connection with the Port Project.

BAPTISTE provided UC-2 two letters that BAPTISTE personally signed, each
of which falsely described separate $25,000 payments that UC-2 had provided to

BAPTISTE to pay bribes via Non-Profit as a charitable, tax deductible donation

to Non-Profit.

BAPTISTE traveled to Haiti to meet with foreign officials, including Foreign
Official-1, to promote, manage, and carry on the bribery scheme in connection

with the Port Project.
Case 1:17-cr-10305-ADB Document 13 Filed 10/04/17 Page 5 of 15

Overt Acts Committed in Furtherance of the Conspiracy Charged in Count One

12. In furtherance of the conspiracy charged in Count One, and to achieve the objects
thereof, at least one of the co-conspirators committed or caused to be committed, in the District
of Massachusetts and elsewhere, at least one of the following overt acts, among others:

13. On or about November 13, 2014, BAPTISTE flew from Baltimore-Washington
International Airport in Maryland to Boston Logan International Airport in Massachusetts to
attend a meeting on the same day at a Boston-area hotel with (âUC-1â).

14. On or about November 13, 2014, BAPTISTE held a meeting with UC-1 at which
he discussed a possible investment with UC-1 in the Port Project; confirmed to UC-1 that a âpay-
to-playâ system existed in Haiti; described bribe payments that would have to be made in
connection with the Port Project, as well as how they could be made; and explained that he could
use Non-Profit to conceal and facilitate bribe payments to the Haitian officials.

15. On or about August 13, 2015, BAPTISTE called UC-1 and discussed plans for an
in-person meeting in Boston, Massachusetts to review details of the Port Project with CC-1.

16. On or about October 10, 2015, CC-1 sent an email to UC-1 to which he attached
letters from Haitian officials, including a letter signed by Foreign Official-1âs predecessor; those
letters contained assurances that the Haitian government would support the Port Project.

17. | Onor about November 12, 2015, BAPTISTE flew from Baltimore-Washington

Case 1:17-cr-10305-ADB Document 13 Filed 10/04/17 Page 6 of 15

18. On or about November 12, 2015, BAPTISTE and CC-1 met with UC-1 and a
second undercover agent of the FBI (âUC-2â), who was introduced as UC-1âs boss (collectively,
âUCsâ).

19. Onor about November 12, 2015, at the meeting described in Paragraph 18 above,

BAPTISTE and CC-1 spoke to the UCs about the Port Project and solicited the UCs to invest in
a factory that would constitute the first phase of the project, with an estimated cost of
approximately $84 million.

20. On or about November 12, 2015, at the meeting described in Paragraph 18 above,
BAPTISTE went to a suite at the hotel and had a one-on-one conversation with UC-2. During
that conversation, BAPTISTE confirmed that bribes totaling approximately 5% of the cost of the
factory would need to be paid to Haitian officials, including Foreign Official-1 and other high-
level officials within the Haitian government. BAPTISTE told UC-2 that he would conceal and
facilitate the bribe payments by using Non-Profit as a conduit for the bribe payments.

21. On or about November 16, 2015, BAPTISTE told UC-2 that he was traveling to
Haiti specifically in connection with the Port Project, and that he was going to meet with Foreign
Official-1 to obtain an updated letter of support. When UC-2 asked BAPTISTE if BAPTISTE
needed anything from UC-2, BAPTISTE responded that UC-2 needed to wire him money as
soon as possible. |

22. Thereafter, on or about November 16, 2015, BAPTISTE sent UC-2 an email
containing the account and routing numbers for Non-Profitâs bank account, so that UC-2 could
wire money to BAPTISTE that he could use to pay bribes to obtain an updated letter of support

from Foreign Official-1.
Case 1:17-cr-10305-ADB Document 13 Filed 10/04/17 Page 7 of 15

23. Onor about November 20, 2015, after UC-2 had wired $25,000 to Non-Profitâs
bank account per BAPTISTEâs instructions, BAPTISTE sent UC-2, via text message and via
email, pictures of himself meeting with Foreign Official-1.

24. On or about November 25, 201 5, BAPTISTE called CC-1 and told him that he
had spoken to Aide-1. BAPTISTE inquired whether it was prudent to suggest to Aide-1 that
Aide-1 would also be compensated if Foreign Official-1 authorized the Port Project. CC-1
agreed that this was a good idea. |

25.  Onor about November 25, 2015, BAPTISTE called Aide-1 and said that
BAPTISTE and CC-1 had talked about making Aide-1 an engineer on the Port Project if Aide-1
could help obtain Foreign Official-1âs authorization for the project.

26. Onor about the evening of December 3, 2015, UC-2 spoke to BAPTISTE by
phone. BAPTISTE told UC-2 that he had used the $25,000 to pay, in cash, Aide-1, Aide-2, and
Lawyer-1. BAPTISTE said that these payments amounted to only half of what BAPTISTE had
promised the staffers for their efforts. BAPTISTE requested that UC-2 send him another
$25,000 to complete the payments. BAPTISTE also stated that he told Foreign Official-1 that he
was going to put Foreign Official-1 on the âpayrollâ and hire him as an advisor for the Port
Project after Foreign Official-1 left office.

27. On or about December 4, 2015, BAPTISTE sent an email to UC-2 attaching a
