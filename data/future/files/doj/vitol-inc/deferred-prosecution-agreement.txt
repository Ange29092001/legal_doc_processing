DEFERRED PROSECUTION AGREEMENT

Defendant Vitol Inc. (the âCompanyââ), pursuant to authority granted by the Companyâs
Board of Directors reflected in Attachment B, the United States Department of Justice, Criminal
Division, Fraud Section (the âFraud Sectionâ), and the United States Attorneyâs Office for the
Eastern District of New York (the âOfficeââ) enter into this Deferred Prosecution Agreement (the
âAgreementâ). Vitol S.A., which is not a defendant in this matter, also agrees, pursuant to the
authority granted by Vitol S.A.âs Board of Directors, to certain terms and obligations of the
Agreement as described below. The terms and conditions of this Agreement are as follows:

Criminal Information and Acceptance of Responsibility

1. The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Fraud Section and the Office will
file the attached criminal information in the United States District Court for the Eastern District
of New York (the âInformationâ) charging the Company with two counts of conspiracy to

commit an offense against the United States, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section
371, that is, to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977
(âFCPAâ), as amended, Title 15, United States Code, Sections 78dd-2 and 78dd-3. In so doing,
the Company: (a) knowingly waives its right to indictment on these charges, as well as all rights
to a speedy trial pursuant to the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, Title 18,
United States Code, Section 3161, and Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 48(b); and (b)
knowingly waives any objection with respect to venue to any charges by the United States
arising out of the conduct described in the Statement of Facts attached as Attachment A
(âStatement of Factsâ) and consents to the filing of the Information, as provided under the terms
of this Agreement, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The
Fraud Section and the Office agree to defer prosecution of the Company pursuant to the terms
and conditions described below.

2. The Company admits, accepts, and acknowledges that it is responsible under
United States law for the acts of its officers, directors, employees, and agents as charged in the
Information, and as set forth in the Statement of Facts, and that the allegations described in the
Information and the facts described in the Statement of Facts are true and accurate. The
Company agrees that, effective as of the date the Company signs this Agreement, in any
prosecution that is deferred by this Agreement, it will not dispute the Statement of Facts set forth
in this Agreement, and, in any such prosecution, the Statement of Facts shall be admissible as:
(a) substantive evidence offered by the government in its case-in-chief and rebuttal case; (b)
impeachment evidence offered by the government on cross-examination; and (c) evidence at any
sentencing hearing or other hearing. In addition, in connection therewith, the Company agrees
not to assert any claim under the United States Constitution, Rule 410 of the Federal Rules of
Evidence, Rule 11(f) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, Section 1B1.1(a) of the United

2
States Sentencing Guidelines (âU.S.S.G.â or âSentencing Guidelinesâ), or any other federal rule
that the Statement of Facts should be suppressed or is otherwise inadmissible as evidence in any
form.
Term of the Agreement

3. This Agreement is effective for a period beginning on the date on which the
Information is filed and ending three years from that date (the ââTermâ). The Company and Vitol
S.A. agree, however, that, in the event the Fraud Section and the Office determine, in their sole
discretion, that the Company or Vitol S.A. has knowingly violated any provision of this
Agreement or has failed to completely perform or fulfill each of the Companyâs or Vitol S.A.âs
obligations under this Agreement, an extension or extensions of the Term may be imposed by the
Fraud Section and the Office, in their sole discretion, for up to a total additional time period of
one year, without prejudice to the Fraud Sectionâs and the Officeâs right to proceed as provided
in Paragraphs 14 to 16 below. Any extension of the Agreement extends all terms of this
Agreement, including the terms of the reporting requirements in Attachment D, for an equivalent
period. Conversely, in the event the Fraud Section and the Office find, in their sole discretion,
that there exists a change in circumstances sufficient to eliminate the need for the reporting
requirements in Attachment D, and that the other provisions of this Agreement have been
satisfied, the Agreement may be terminated early. If the Court refuses to grant exclusion of time
under the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. Â§ 3161(h)(2), the Term shall be deemed to have not
begun, and all the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed null and void, except that the
statute of limitations for any prosecution relating to the conduct described in the Statement of

Facts shall be tolled from the date on which this Agreement is signed until the date the Court
refuses to grant the exclusion of time plus six months, and except for the provisions contained
within Paragraph 2 of this Agreement.
Relevant Considerations
4. The Fraud Section and the Office enter into this Agreement based on the individual
facts and circumstances presented by this case and by the Company and Vitol S.A., including:

a. the Company did not receive voluntary disclosure credit pursuant to the
FCPA Corporate Enforcement Policy in the Department of Justice Manual 9-47.120, or pursuant
to the Sentencing Guidelines, because it did not disclose to the Fraud Section and the Office the
conduct described in the Statement of Facts;

b. the Company received full credit for its cooperation and Vitol S.A.âs
cooperation with the Fraud Sectionâs and the Officeâs investigation, including: (1) making factual
presentations to the Fraud Section and the Office; (ii) voluntarily facilitating the interview in the
United States of a former foreign-based employee; (iii) producing to the Fraud Section and the
Office, on a prompt basis, relevant documents, including documents located outside the United
States, accompanied by translations of documents; and (iv) timely accepting responsibility and
reaching a prompt resolution;

c. the Company and Vitol S.A. provided to the Fraud Section and the Office
all relevant facts known to them, including information about the individuals involved in the
conduct described in the Statement of Facts and conduct disclosed to the Fraud Section and the
Office prior to the Agreement;

d. the Company, Vitol S.A. and their affiliates engaged in remedial measures,
including personnel changes; implementation of enhanced policies, procedures and internal

controls relating to, among other things, anti-corruption, retention and management of commercial

4
agents and other third parties, and gifts, travel and entertainment; internal investigations and risk
assessments; and enhancements to training and internal reporting programs;

e. the Company and Vitol S.A. have enhanced and have committed to
continuing to enhance their compliance programs and internal controls, including ensuring that
their compliance programs satisfy the minimum elements set forth in Attachment C to this
Agreement (Corporate Compliance Program);

f. based on the Companyâs and Vitol S.A.âs remediation and the state of their
compliance programs, and the Companyâs and Vitol S.A.âs agreement to report to the Fraud
Section and the Office as set forth in Attachment D to this Agreement (Corporate Compliance
Reporting), the Fraud Section and the Office determined that an independent compliance monitor
was unnecessary;

g. the nature and seriousness of the offense conduct, as described in the
Statement of Facts, including the Companyâs involvement in schemes to pay millions of dollars to
officials of Brazil, Ecuador and Mexico, as well as the duration of the misconduct;

h. the Company has no prior criminal history;

1. the Company has resolved with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission (âCFTCâ) through a cease-and-desist proceeding relating to the conduct described in
the Statement of Facts and other conduct, and has agreed to pay $12,791,000 in
disgorgement relating to the conduct described in the Statement of Facts and a $16,000,000 penalty
relating to trading activity not covered by the Statement of Facts;

j- the Company is entering into a resolution with authorities in Brazil relating
to the same conduct described in the Statement of Facts related to Brazil, which the Fraud Section

and the Office are crediting in connection with the penalty in this Agreement;
k. the Company has agreed to continue to cooperate with the Fraud Section
and the Office in any ongoing investigation as described in Paragraph 5 below;

1. accordingly, after considering (a) through (k) above, the Fraud Section and
the Office believe that the appropriate resolution in this case is a Deferred Prosecution Agreement
with the Company; a criminal monetary penalty in the amount of $135,000,000, which reflects a
discount of 25 percent off the bottom of the otherwise-applicable Sentencing Guidelines fine
range; and the Companyâs and Vitol S.A.âs agreement to report to the Fraud Section and the Office
as set forth in Attachment D to this Agreement.

Future Cooperation and Disclosure Requirements

5. The Company and Vitol S.A. shall cooperate fully with the Fraud Section and the
Office in any and all matters relating to the conduct described in the Statement of Facts and other
conduct under investigation by the Fraud Section and the Office at any time during the Term,
subject to applicable laws and regulations, until the later of the date upon which all investigations
and prosecutions arising out of such conduct are concluded, or the end of the Term. At the
request of the Fraud Section and the Office, the Company and Vitol S.A. shall also cooperate
fully with other domestic or foreign law enforcement and regulatory authorities and agencies, as
well as the Multilateral Development Banks (âMDBsâ), in any investigation of the Company or
Vitol S.A., their parent companies, their subsidiaries, or their affiliates, or any of their present or
former officers, directors, employees, agents, and consultants, or any other party, in any and all
matters relating to the conduct described in this Agreement and the Statement of Facts and other
conduct under investigation by the Fraud Section and the Office. The Companyâs and Vitol
S.A.âs cooperation pursuant to this Paragraph is subject to applicable law and regulations,

including data privacy and national security laws, as well as valid claims of attorney-client

6
privilege or attorney work product doctrine; however, the Company and Vitol S.A. must provide
to the Fraud Section and the Office a log of any information or cooperation that is not provided
based on an assertion of law, regulation, or privilege, and the Company and Vitol S.A. bear the
burden of establishing the validity of any such assertion. The Company and Vitol S.A. agree that
their cooperation pursuant to this Paragraph shall include, but not be limited to, the following:

a. The Company and Vitol S.A. shall truthfully disclose all factual
information with respect to their activities, those of their parent companies, subsidiaries, and
affiliates, and those of their present and former directors, officers, employees, agents, and
consultants, including any evidence or allegations and internal or external investigations, about
which the Company or Vitol S.A. have any knowledge or about which the Fraud Section and the
Office may inquire. This obligation of truthful disclosure includes, but is not limited to, the
obligation of the Company and Vitol S.A. to provide to the Fraud Section and the Office, upon
request, any document, record or other tangible evidence about which the Fraud Section and the
Office may inquire of the Company or Vitol S.A.

b. Upon request of the Fraud Section and the Office, the Company and Vitol
S.A. shall designate knowledgeable employees, agents or attorneys to provide to the Fraud
Section and the Office the information and materials described in Paragraph 5(a) above on behalf
of the Company and Vitol S.A. It is further understood that the Company and Vitol S.A. must at
all times provide complete, truthful, and accurate information.

c. The Company and Vitol S.A. shall use their best efforts to make available
for interviews or testimony, as requested by the Fraud Section and the Office, present or former
officers, directors, employees, agents and consultants of the Company or Vitol S.A. This

obligation includes, but is not limited to, sworn testimony before a federal grand jury or in

7
federal trials, as well as interviews with domestic or foreign law enforcement and regulatory
authorities. Cooperation under this Paragraph shall include identification of witnesses who, to
the knowledge of the Company or Vitol S.A., may have material information regarding the
matters under investigation.

d. With respect to any information, testimony, documents, records or other
tangible evidence provided to the Fraud Section and the Office pursuant to this Agreement, the
Company and Vitol S.A. consent to any and all disclosures to other governmental authorities,
including United States authorities and those of a foreign government, as well as the MDBs, of
such materials as the Fraud Section and the Office, in their sole discretion, shall deem
appropriate.

6. In addition to the obligations in Paragraph 5, during the Term, should the
Company or Vitol S.A. learn of any evidence or allegation of conduct that: (1) may constitute a
violation of the FCPA anti-bribery provisions had the conduct occurred within the jurisdiction of
the United States; or (2) may constitute obtaining inside information through illegal means had
the conduct occurred within the jurisdiction of the United States, the Company and Vitol S.A.
shall promptly report such evidence or allegation to the Fraud Section and the Office.

Payment of Monetary Penalty

7. The Fraud Section and the Office and the Company agree that application of the

Sentencing Guidelines to determine the applicable fine range yields the following analysis

a. The November 1, 2018 version of the Sentencing Guidelines is applicable
to this matter.

b. Offense Level. Based upon U.S.S.G. Â§ 2C1.1, the total offense level is 40,
calculated as follows:

Â§ 2C1.1(a)(2) Base Offense Level 12

8
Â§ 2C1.1(b)(1) More than One Bribe +2
Â§Â§ 2C1.1(b)(2), 2B1.1(b)(1)(L) Value of Benefit +22
Received (more than $25,000,000)

Â§ 2C1.1(b)(3) High Level Official +4
TOTAL 40

c. Base Fine. Based upon U.S.S.G. Â§ 8C2.4(a)(1), the base fine is
$150,000,000.

d. Culpability Score. Based upon U.S.S.G. Â§ 8C2.5, the culpability score is 6,
calculated as follows:

(a) Base Culpability Score 5

(b)(3)(A)G) The organization had 200 or more

employees and an individual within high-level

personnel of the organization participated in,

condoned, or was willfully ignorant of the offense +3

(g)(2) The organization clearly demonstrated
recognition and affirmative acceptance of
responsibility for its criminal conduct -2

TOTAL 6

Calculation of Fine Range:

 

Base Fine $150,000,000
Multipliers 1.2 (min) / 2.4 (max)
Fine Range $180,000,000 / $360,000,000

The Company agrees to pay a total monetary penalty in the amount of $135,000,000 (the âTotal
Criminal Fineâ). This reflects a 25 percent discount off the bottom of the applicable Sentencing
Guidelines fine range. The Company and the Fraud Section and the Office agree that the
Company will pay the United States $90,000,000, equal to approximately two-thirds of the Total

9
Criminal Fine. The Company agrees to pay $90,000,000 to the United States Treasury within ten
business days of the execution of this Agreement. The Fraud Section and the Office agree to
credit the remaining amount of the Total Criminal Fine against the amount the Company pays to
Brazilian authorities, up to a maximum of $45,000,000, equal to approximately one-third of the
Total Criminal Fine, so long as the Company pays the remaining amount to Brazil pursuant to
the Companyâs separate resolution with Brazilian authorities that addresses the same underlying
conduct related to Brazil as described in the Statement of Facts. In the event the Company does
not pay the Brazilian authorities, pursuant to a resolution, any part of the $45,000,000 within
twelve months of the execution of this Agreement, the Company will be required to pay the full
remaining amount to the United States Treasury on or before December 3, 2021. The Company
and the Fraud Section and the Office agree that this penalty is appropriate given the facts and
circumstances of this case, including the Relevant Considerations described in Paragraph 4 of
this Agreement. The Total Criminal Fine is final and shall not be refunded. Furthermore,
nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed an agreement by the Fraud Section and the Office
that the Total Criminal Fine is the maximum penalty that may be imposed in any future
prosecution, and the Fraud Section and the Office are not precluded from arguing in any future
prosecution that the Court should impose a higher fine, although the Fraud Section and the
Office agree that under those circumstances, they will recommend to the Court that any amount
paid under this Agreement should be offset against any fine the Court imposes as part of a future
judgment. The Company acknowledges that no tax deduction may be sought in connection with
the payment of any part of the Total Criminal Fine. The Company shall not seek or accept
directly or indirectly reimbursement or indemnification from any source with regard to the

penalty or disgorgement amounts that the Company pays pursuant to this Agreement or any other

10
agreement entered into with an enforcement authority or regulator concerning the facts set forth
in the Statement of Facts.
Conditional Release from Liability

8. Subject to Paragraphs 14 to 16, the Fraud Section and the Office agree, except as
provided in this Agreement, that they will not bring any criminal or civil case against the
Company or Vitol S.A., or any of their direct or indirect corporate affiliates or subsidiaries,
relating to any of the conduct described in the Statement of Facts or the criminal Information
filed pursuant to this Agreement. The Fraud Section and the Office, however, may use any
information related to the conduct described in the Statement of Facts against the Company: (a)
in a prosecution for perjury or obstruction of justice; (b) in a prosecution for making a false
statement; (c) in a prosecution or other proceeding relating to any crime of violence; or (d) ina
prosecution or other proceeding relating to a violation of any provision of Title 26 of the United
States Code.

a. This Agreement does not provide any protection against prosecution for
any future conduct by the Company.
b. In addition, this Agreement does not provide any protection against
prosecution of any individuals, regardless of their affiliation with the Company.
Corporate Compliance Program

9. The Company and Vitol S.A. represent that they have implemented and will
continue to implement a compliance and ethics program designed to prevent and detect
violations of the FCPA and other applicable anti-corruption laws throughout their operations,
including those of their affiliates, subsidiaries, agents, and joint ventures, and those of their

contractors and subcontractors whose responsibilities include interacting with foreign officials or

11
other activities carrying a high risk of corruption, including, but not limited to, the minimum
elements set forth in Attachment C.

10. In order to address any deficiencies in their internal accounting controls, policies,
and procedures, the Company and Vitol S.A. represent that they have undertaken, and will
continue to undertake in the future, in a manner consistent with all of their obligations under this
Agreement, a review of their existing internal accounting controls, policies, and procedures,
regarding compliance with the FCPA and other applicable anti-corruption laws. Where
necessary and appropriate, the Company and Vitol S.A. agree to adopt a new compliance
program, or to modify its existing one, including internal controls, compliance policies, and
procedures in order to ensure that they maintain: (a) an effective system of internal accounting
controls designed to ensure the making and keeping of fair and accurate books, records, and
accounts; and (b) a rigorous anti-corruption compliance program that incorporates relevant
internal accounting controls, as well as policies and procedures designed to effectively detect and
deter violations of the FCPA and other applicable anti-corruption laws. The compliance
program, including the internal accounting controls system will include, but not be limited to, the
minimum elements set forth in Attachment C.

Corporate Compliance Reporting

11. The Company and Vitol S.A. agree that they will report to the Fraud Section and
the Office annually during the Term regarding remediation and implementation of the
compliance measures described in Attachment C. These reports will be prepared in accordance

with Attachment D.

12
Deferred Prosecution

12. In consideration of the undertakings agreed to by the Company and Vitol S.A.
herein, the Fraud Section and the Office agree that any prosecution of the Company for the
conduct set forth in the Statement of Facts be and hereby is deferred for the Term. To the extent
there is conduct disclosed by the Company or Vitol S.A. that is not set forth in the Statement of
Facts, such conduct will not be exempt from further prosecution and is not within the scope of or
relevant to this Agreement.

13. The Fraud Section and the Office further agree that if the Company and Vitol
S.A. fully comply with all of their obligations under this Agreement, the Fraud Section and the
Office will not continue the criminal prosecution against the Company described in Paragraph 1
and, at the conclusion of the Term, this Agreement shall expire. Within six months after the
Agreementâs expiration, the Fraud Section and the Office shall seek dismissal with prejudice of
the Information filed against the Company described in Paragraph 1, and agree not to file charges
in the future against the Company based on the conduct described in this Agreement and the
Statement of Facts. If, however, the Fraud Section and the Office determine during this six-
month period that the Company or Vitol S.A. breached the Agreement during the Term, as
described in Paragraph 14, the Fraud Sectionâs and the Officeâs ability to extend the Term, as
described in Paragraph 3, or to pursue other remedies, including those described in Paragraphs
14 to 16, remains in full effect.

Breach of the Agreement

14. If, during the Term, the Company or Vitol S.A. (a) commits any felony under

U.S. federal law; (b) provides in connection with this Agreement deliberately false, incomplete,

or misleading information, including in connection with its disclosure of information about

13
individual culpability; (c) fails to cooperate as set forth in Paragraphs 5 and 6 of this Agreement;
(d) fails to implement a compliance program as set forth in Paragraphs 9 and 10 of this
Agreement and Attachment C; (e) commits any acts that, had they occurred within the
jurisdictional reach of the FCPA, would be a violation of the FCPA; or (f) otherwise fails to
completely perform or fulfill each of the Companyâs and Vitol S.A.âs obligations under the
Agreement, regardless of whether the Fraud Section and the Office become aware of such a
breach after the Term is complete, the Company shall thereafter be subject to prosecution for any
federal criminal violation of which the Fraud Section and the Office have knowledge, including,
but not limited to, the charges in the Information described in Paragraph 1, which may be
pursued by the Fraud Section and the Office in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of
New York or any other appropriate venue. Determination of whether the Company or Vitol S.A.
has breached the Agreement and whether to pursue prosecution of the Company shall be in the
Fraud Sectionâs and the Officeâs sole discretion. Any such prosecution may be premised on
information provided by the Company, Vitol S.A. or their personnel. Any such prosecution
relating to the conduct described in the Statement of Facts or relating to conduct known to the
Fraud Section and the Office prior to the date on which this Agreement was signed that is not
time-barred by the applicable statute of limitations on the date of the signing of this Agreement
may be commenced against the Company or Vitol S.A., notwithstanding the expiration of the
statute of limitations, between the signing of this Agreement and the expiration of the Term plus
one year. Thus, by signing this Agreement, the Company and Vitol S.A. agree that the statute of
limitations with respect to any such prosecution that is not time-barred on the date of the signing
of this Agreement shall be tolled for the Term plus one year. In addition, the Company agrees

that the statute of limitations as to any violation of federal law that occurs during the Term will

14
be tolled from the date upon which the violation occurs until the earlier of the date upon which
the Fraud Section and the Office are made aware of the violation or the duration of the Term plus
five years, and that this period shall be excluded from any calculation of time for purposes of the
application of the statute of limitations.

15. In the event the Fraud Section and the Office determine that the Company or
Vitol S.A. has breached this Agreement, the Fraud Section and the Office agree to provide the
Company and Vitol S.A. with written notice of such breach prior to instituting any prosecution
resulting from such breach. Within 30 days of receipt of such notice, the Company and Vitol
S.A. shall have the opportunity to respond to the Fraud Section and the Office in writing to
explain the nature and circumstances of such breach, as well as the actions the Company and
Vitol S.A. have taken to address and remediate the situation, which explanation the Fraud
Section and the Office shall consider in determining whether to pursue prosecution of the
Company.

16. In the event the Fraud Section and the Office determine that the Company or
Vitol S.A. has breached this Agreement: (a) all statements made by or on behalf of the Company
and Vitol S.A. to the Fraud Section and the Office or to the Court, including the Statement of
Facts, and any testimony given by the Company before a grand jury, a court, or any tribunal, or
at any legislative hearings, whether prior or subsequent to this Agreement, and any leads derived
from such statements or testimony, shall be admissible in evidence in any and all criminal
proceedings brought by the Fraud Section and the Office against the Company and Vitol S.A.;
and (b) the Company and Vitol S.A. shall not assert any claim under the United States
Constitution, Rule 11(f) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rule 410 of the Federal

Rules of Evidence, or any other federal rule that any such statements or testimony made by or on

15
behalf of the Company or Vitol S.A. prior or subsequent to this Agreement, or any leads derived
therefrom, should be suppressed or are otherwise inadmissible. The decision whether conduct or
statements of any current director, officer or employee, or any person acting on behalf of, or at
the direction of, the Company or Vitol S.A., will be imputed to the Company and Vitol S.A. for
the purpose of determining whether the Company and Vitol S.A. have violated any provision of
this Agreement shall be in the sole discretion of the Fraud Section and the Office.

17. The Company and Vitol S.A. acknowledge that the Fraud Section and the Office
have made no representations, assurances, or promises concerning what sentence may be
imposed by the Court if the Company or Vitol S.A. breaches this Agreement and this matter
proceeds to judgment. The Company and Vitol S.A. further acknowledge that any such sentence
is solely within the discretion of the Court and that nothing in this Agreement binds or restricts
the Court in the exercise of such discretion.

18. On the date that the period of deferred prosecution specified in this Agreement
expires, the Company and Vitol S.A., by the Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director,
respectively, of the Company and Vitol S.A., and the Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer,
respectively, of the Company and Vitol S.A., will certify to the Fraud Section and the Office, in
the form of executing the document attached as Attachment E to this Agreement, that the
Company and Vitol S.A. have met their disclosure obligations pursuant to Paragraph 6 of this
Agreement. Each certification will be deemed a material statement and representation by the
Company and Vitol S.A. to the executive branch of the United States for purposes of 18 U.S.C.
Â§Â§ 1001 and 1519, and it will be deemed to have been made in the judicial district in which this

Agreement is filed.

16
Sale, Merger, or Other Change in Corporate Form of Company

19. Except as may otherwise be agreed by the parties in connection with a particular
transaction, the Company and Vitol S.A. agree that in the event that, during the Term, they
undertake any change in corporate form, including if they sell, merge, or transfer business
operations that are material to the Company or Vitol S.A.âs consolidated operations, or to the
operations of any subsidiaries or affiliates involved in the conduct described in the Statement of
Facts, as they exist as of the date of this Agreement, whether such sale is structured as a sale,
asset sale, merger, transfer, or other change in corporate form, they shall include in any contract
for sale, merger, transfer, or other change in corporate form a provision binding the purchaser, or
any successor in interest thereto, to the obligations described in this Agreement. The purchaser
or successor in interest must also agree in writing that the Fraud Sectionâs and the Officeâs
ability to determine a breach under this Agreement is applicable in full force to that entity. The
Company and Vitol S.A. agree that the failure to include these provisions in the transaction will
make any such transaction null and void. The Company and Vitol S.A. shall provide notice to
the Fraud Section and the Office at least 30 days prior to undertaking any such sale, merger,
transfer, or other change in corporate form. The Fraud Section and the Office shall notify the
Company and Vitol S.A. prior to such transaction (or series of transactions) if they determine
that the transaction(s) will have the effect of circumventing or frustrating the enforcement
purposes of this Agreement. If at any time during the Term the Company or Vitol S.A. engages
in a transaction(s) that has the effect of circumventing or frustrating the enforcement purposes of
this Agreement, the Fraud Section and the Office may deem it a breach of this Agreement
pursuant to Paragraphs 14 to 16 of this Agreement. Nothing herein shall restrict the Company

and Vitol S.A. from indemnifying (or otherwise holding harmless) the purchaser or successor in

17
interest for penalties or other costs arising from any conduct that may have occurred prior to the
date of the transaction, so long as such indemnification does not have the effect of circumventing
or frustrating the enforcement purposes of this Agreement, as determined by the Fraud Section
and the Office.
Public Statements by Company

20. The Company and Vitol S.A. expressly agree that they shall not, through present
or future attorneys, officers, directors, employees, agents or any other person authorized to speak
for the Company or Vitol S.A. make any public statement, in litigation or otherwise,
contradicting the acceptance of responsibility by the Company set forth above or the facts
described in the Statement of Facts. Any such contradictory statement shall, subject to cure
rights of the Company and Vitol S.A. described below, constitute a breach of this Agreement,
and the Company thereafter shall be subject to prosecution as set forth in Paragraphs 14 to 16 of
this Agreement. The decision whether any public statement by any such person contradicting a
fact contained in the Statement of Facts will be imputed to the Company and Vitol S.A. for the
purpose of determining whether they have breached this Agreement shall be at the sole discretion
of the Fraud Section and the Office. If the Fraud Section and the Office determine that a public
statement by any such person contradicts in whole or in part a statement contained in the
Statement of Facts, the Fraud Section and the Office shall so notify the Company and Vitol S.A.,
and the Company and Vitol S.A. may avoid a breach of this Agreement by publicly repudiating
such statement(s) within five business days after notification. The Company and Vitol S.A. shall
be permitted to raise defenses and to assert affirmative claims in other proceedings relating to the
matters set forth in the Statement of Facts provided that such defenses and claims do not

contradict, in whole or in part, a statement contained in the Statement of Facts. This Paragraph

18

Overview of the Brazil Bribery Scheme

25. In or about and between 2005 and 2014, Vitol, through certain of its employees
and agents, knowingly and willfully conspired and agreed with others to corruptly offer and pay
more than $8 million in bribes to, and for the benefit of, Brazilian officials to secure an improper
advantage in order to obtain and retain business from Petrobras in connection with the purchase
and sale of oil products. Vitol and its affiliated companies earned at least $33 million in profits
from its corruptly obtained contracts with Petrobras.

26. In furtherance of the scheme, Vitol and its co-conspirators entered into sham
consulting agreements, established a fictitious company to divert funds to offshore shell
companies and created fake invoices for purported consulting services and âmarket intelligence.â
At times, Vitol and its co-conspirators used the U.S. financial system to transmit bribe payments,
including through transactions in the Eastern District of New York, into offshore bank accounts,
from which the bribes were paid in cash and/or via electronic wire payments to Brazilian
officials.

A. 2005-2014: Bribes to Brazilian Official 1

27. In or about and between 2005 and 2014, Vitol and its co-conspirators caused
corrupt payments of more than $3 million to be made to Brazilian Official 1 and at least three
other officials at Petrobras in exchange for receiving confidential Petrobras information,
including: (1) âmarket intelligence,â which included internal Petrobras import and export
forecasts and other confidential information intended to benefit Vitol in trading with Petrobras;

and (ii) âlast lookâ information, including confidential bid information that Petrobras received

A-7
from Vitolâs competitors, which Vitol used to determine the amount it would need to bid to win
public tenders.
1. Bribes for âMarket Intelligenceâ

28. In or about August 2005, Vitol Trader 1 asked Vitol Brazil Executive to find a
contact within Petrobras who could provide Vitol with confidential information regarding
Petrobrasâs fuel oil import and export program. The information Vitol Trader 1 requested
included information that was detailed in weekly internal Petrobras reports that contained
Petrobrasâs production volume and quality, anticipated imports, shipping routes and cargo
loading details. On or about August 23, 2005, Vitol Trader 1 told Vitol Brazil Executive in an
instant message exchange to get the information through âthe back doorâ because Petrobrasâs
âtraders will never tell you anything . . . it has to be somebody in the planning/scheduling
[d]Jept.â

29. In or about September 2005, during a lunch meeting with Vitol Brazil Executive,
Brazilian Official 1 offered to provide Vitol Brazil Executive with confidential Petrobras
information in exchange for bribe payments of $5,000 per month.

30. Following that meeting, on or about September 30, 2005, Vitol Brazil Executive
sent Vitol Trader 1 a message through an instant messaging system stating, âjust to inform you
that the contact inside PB[,] it was made.â Vitol Brazil Executive then spoke separately with
Vitol Trader 1 and Vitol Trader 2, and agreed to pay monthly bribes to Brazilian Official 1 in
exchange for Vitol receiving confidential Petrobras information.

31. Pursuant to their agreement, Brazilian Official 1 provided Vitol Brazil Executive
with confidential Petrobras information orally during regular in-person meetings, by giving Vitol

Brazil Executive electronic storage devices loaded with internal Petrobras documents and via

A-8
email. Vitol Brazil Executive shared the confidential information by email and telephone with
Vitol Trader 1, Vitol Trader 2 and other Vitol Group employees in Houston and elsewhere. Vitol
Brazil Executive described the information he passed to other Vitol employees as âmarket
intelligence.â

32. Over time, and with the agreement of Vitol Trader 1 and Vitol Trader 2, Vitol
increased the amount of the bribe payments to Brazilian Official 1 for âmarket intelligence.â
The bribe payments ranged from approximately $5,000 per month in 2005 to approximately
$12,000 per month by in or about January 2014.

2. Bribes for âLast Lookâ Information

33. In or about February 2006, Brazilian Official 1 offered Vitol Brazil Executive
âlast lookâ information on confidential competitive bids for fuel oil that Petrobras received from
other companies, which would allow Vitol to match or beat the final bids submitted by Vitolâs
competitors.

34. Shortly thereafter, Vitol Brazil Executive received approval from Vitol Trader 1
and Vitol Trader 2 to proceed with making bribe payments to get âlast lookâ information. Vitol
paid Brazilian Official 1 bribes in the amount of eight cents per barrel of fuel oil that Vitol
purchased from Petrobras in winning tenders.

35. Vitol Brazil Executive shared the confidential âlast lookâ information with Vitol
Trader 1, Vitol Trader 2 and other Vitol Group employees based in Houston and elsewhere via
telephone and email. Using this information, Vitol employees determined the exact price that
Vitol would need to bid to win a given Petrobras tender. Vitol Trader 2 and other Vitol
employees sometimes referred to this price as the âgold numberâ or the âgolden numberâ in

internal emails.

A-9
36. For example, in an email exchange on or about May 10, 2013, between Vitol
Brazil Executive and five Vitol Group employees in Houston and elsewhere, Vitol Brazil
Executive reported that, â[Competitor] is offering plm +3,25. This is the gold number.â In
response, a Vitol trader in Houston asked, âSo if we go to +325 they will give it to us?â Vitol
Brazil Executive responded, âYes. This is the gold number.â The trader responded, âOkay,
great...weâll take it.â

37. After winning the trade, on or about May 29, 2013, Vitol took possession of the
cargo in Houston, Texas. On or about December 22, 2014, a fictitious company created by Vitol
Brazil Executive (the âBrazil Sham Company,â the identity of which is known to the United
States and to the Company) invoiced Vitol S.A. for a per-barrel commission on the trade. The
invoice directed Vitol S.A. to wire funds, through a correspondent bank account located in the
United States, to a bank account in the Bahamas associated with a Brazilian âdoleiro,â that is, an
individual who served as a professional money launderer and black market money exchanger, for
purposes of paying a bribe to Brazilian Official 1 in cash.

38. From at least in or about and between March 2006 and December 2014, Vitol
paid for and received confidential âlast lookâ information for over 50 Petrobras tenders. In
addition, on at least five occasions, Vitol also paid per barrel bribes to Brazilian Official 1 and
three other Petrobras officials in connection with tenders outside of Brazil in which Petrobras
was a Vitol competitor. In connection with these tenders outside of Brazil, Vitol paid bribes to
Petrobras officials in the amount of eight cents per barrel if Vitol won the tender or four cents per

barrel if Vitol did not win.

A-10
3. Transmission of Bribe Payments

39. To facilitate and conceal Vitolâs corrupt payments to Brazilian Official 1 and
others, Vitol Brazil Executive, with the knowledge of Vitol Trader 1 and Vitol Trader 2, used the
Brazil Sham Company to invoice Vitol for amounts that would include bribes to be paid to
Brazilian Official 1.

AO. Vitol caused dozens of invoices from Brazil Sham Company to be paid from an
account in Switzerland held by Vitol S.A. to other accounts in Switzerland and the United States,
ultimately for the payment of cash bribes to Brazilian officials. In general, the funds were then
transferred from the accounts in Switzerland and the United States to accounts in the Bahamas
and Grand Cayman. These accounts were held by doleiros, who converted the funds into
Brazilian currency so that Vitol Brazil Executive could deliver cash to Brazilian Official 1.

41. For example, a âmarket intelligenceâ invoice from Brazil Sham Company, dated
on or about June 27, 2014, directed Vitol S.A. to pay $78,860 to an account in the Bahamas.
This account was held by a shell company associated with a Brazilian doleiro. Vitolâs payment
to the account passed through a correspondent bank account located in the United States. The
invoice sought monthly payments for âmarket intelligenceâ that Vitol expected to receive in or
about and between July 2014 and December 2014.

42. Likewise, a Brazil Sham Company invoice dated on or about June 26, 2013, was
related to the receipt of âlast lookâ information. The invoice directed Vitol S.A. to pay an 8-
cents-per-barrel commission totaling $56,227.06 to a bank account in the Bahamas. The account
was held by a company associated with a Brazilian doleiro, and the bribe payment passed

through a correspondent bank account located in the United States.

A-11
43. After Vitol paid the Brazil Sham Company invoices and the doleiros converted
the funds into Brazilian currency, Vitol Brazil Executive typically delivered cash bribe payments
to Brazilian Official 1, who shared the per-barrel bribe payments with three other Brazilian
officials.

B. 2011-2014: Bribes to Brazilian Officials 2 through 6

44. While the bribery scheme involving Brazilian Official 1 was ongoing, Vitol also
made corrupt bribe payments of more than $5 million to five additional officials at Petrobras,
including Brazilian Official 2, Brazilian Official 3, Brazilian Official 4, Brazilian Official 5 and
Brazilian Official 6. Vitol paid the bribes to these Brazilian officials through intermediaries,
Brazil Consultant 1 and Brazil Consultant 2, in exchange for receiving confidential pricing
information that Vitol, at times, used to bid or offer on fuel oil contracts from Petrobras.

45. Acting on behalf of Vitol, Brazil Consultant 2 engaged in secret negotiations with
Brazilian Official 2, through Brazil Consultant 1, to establish corruptly-agreed upon prices for
Petrobras contracts that included bribes to the Brazilian officials and commissions to Brazil
Consultant 1 and Brazil Consultant 2. After the prices were secretly agreed to pursuant to the
corrupt scheme, the parties engaged in sham negotiations to make those negotiations appear
legitimate.

1. Bribes for Confidential Price Information

46. In or about early 2011, Brazilian Official 3 sought assistance from Brazil
Consultant 1 in finding an oil trading company that would pay bribes in exchange for receiving
fuel oil contracts with Petrobras through Petrobrasâs trading operation in Houston. Brazil
Consultant 1 suggested that Brazilian Official 3 could set up a scheme with Vitol, claiming that

he had contacts within the company. Brazilian Official 3 thereafter introduced Brazil Consultant

A-12
1 to Brazilian Official 2, a trader in Petrobrasâs fuel oil group in Houston, to further discuss the
scheme.

47. In or about April 2011, Brazil Consultant 2 met with a senior Vitol executive
and, later, Vitol Trader 1 in Houston to discuss Brazil Consultant 2âs potential engagement by
Vitol to develop business with Petrobras. In an email to Brazil Consultant 2 on or about April
26, 2011, Brazil Consultant 1 asked Brazil Consultant 2 to confirm what took place at the April
2011 meeting: âIf I understood correctly [the senior Vitol executive] said ok but please settle the
details with [Vitol Trader 1]. Am I right?â Brazil Consultant 2 responded, âAbsolutely right!â

A8. In a telephone call in or about early 2011 with Brazilian Official 2, Brazilian
Official 3 and Brazilian Official 4, Brazil Consultant 1 reported that Vitol had agreed to the
details of the scheme and that the commissions paid from Vitol to Brazil Consultant 2 would be
determined on a deal-by-deal basis.

49, Also in or about early 2011, Brazil Consultant 1, Brazilian Official 2, Brazilian
Official 3 and another Brazilian official held a meeting in Houston during which they agreed that
payments to the group would be made to a bank account controlled by Brazilian Official 2 and
then divided between Brazilian Official 2, Brazilian Official 3 and Brazilian Official 4. Brazilian
Official 5 and Brazilian Official 6 also agreed, at a later date, to receive their share of the bribes
through Brazilian Official 2.

50. In exchange for the bribe payments, Brazilian Official 2 provided confidential
product and pricing information that allowed Vitol to determine its interest in pursuing a deal for
that particular Petrobras cargo shipment. After the information was provided, Brazil Consultant
2, acting on behalf of Vitol, negotiated a final price with Brazilian Official 2, through Brazil

Consultant 1, between Vitol and Petrobras. The âdeltaâ between the sale price and the purchase

A-13
price would be used to pay commissions and bribes. They then facilitated a staged negotiation
between Petrobras and Vitol for that particular cargo. For example, on or about March 4, 2011,
Brazil Consultant 1 (using the alias âTigerâ) sent an email to Brazilian Official 3 (using the alias
âDehl Phinâ) and Brazilian Official 4 to advise them of the price Petrobras should offer to Vitol
for a particular cargo, the price with which Vitol Trader 1 should counter, and the price on which
they should agree at the end of the staged negotiation: âGentlemen, your email should be to
[Vitol Trader 1] indicating +17, Geneva will counter at +15 and close @ +16.â

51. Vitol consummated more than 30 transactions with Petrobras in this or a similar
manner in or about and between 2011 and 2014.

2. Payments Through Brazil Consultant 1 and Brazil Consultant 2

52. To facilitate and conceal the corrupt bribe payments to Brazilian Official 2,
Brazilian Official 3, Brazilian Official 4, Brazilian Official 5 and Brazilian Official 6, Vitol
entered into sham consulting agreements with companies controlled by Brazil Consultant 2.
Once the trades between Vitol and Petrobras were finalized and the cargoes delivered, Brazil
Consultant 2 sent Vitol an invoice for the commissions from Brazil Consultant 2âs consulting
companies.

53. In general, upon receiving a payment from Vitol, Brazil Consultant 1 and Brazil
Consultant 2 kept a portion of that payment and used the balance to pay bribes to Brazilian
Official 2, Brazilian Official 3, Brazilian Official 4, Brazilian Official 5 and Brazilian Official 6
by wire transfer into bank accounts controlled by the Brazilian officials in Uruguay, Brazil and
elsewhere. Some of the bribes were also paid in cash.

54. For example, in an email on or about May 5, 2011, Brazil Consultant 1 provided

a spreadsheet to Brazilian Official 2, Brazilian Official 3 and Brazilian Official 4 showing the

A-14
amounts invoiced to Vitol and another trading company, each member of the schemeâs âshareâ
of the commissions paid by Vitol and âwhat has already been paid.â Brazil Consultant 1 also
described bribes paid but awaiting distribution: â[Brazilian Official 4] â you still have with me
the amounts $ 66.264 + $ 86.763, for which I ask your instructions . . .â

The Ecuador and Mexico Bribery Scheme

55. In or about and between 2015 and 2020, Vitol, through certain of its employees
and agents, knowingly and willfully conspired and agreed with others to corruptly offer and pay
more than $2 million in bribes to, and for the benefit of, officials in Ecuador and Mexico to
secure an improper advantage in order to obtain and retain business in connection with the
purchase and sale of oil products.

56. In furtherance of the scheme, Vitol and its co-conspirators entered into several
sham consulting agreements, set up shell companies for the purpose of laundering the corrupt
payments, created fake invoices for purported consulting services and used email accounts with
pseudonyms to transfer funds to offshore shell companies involved in the conspiracy. The illegal
payments were made through multiple bank accounts in the United States, including in the
Eastern District of New York, and abroad in an effort to conceal the bribes.

A. Bribes to Ecuadorian Official 1 and Ecuadorian Official 2

57. For example, beginning in or about 2015, Vitol, through its employees and
agents, including Aguilar and Ecuador Consultant 1, agreed to pay bribes to Ecuadorian Official
1 and Ecuadorian Official 2 in exchange for identifying business opportunities for Vitol and
others with Petroecuador and, in some cases, using their influence to ensure Vitol received the

benefit of those opportunities.

A-15
58. Toward that end, in or about 2016, Vitol, through its employees and agents,
including Aguilar and Ecuador Consultant 1, and Ecuadorian Official 1 began working on a
prospective project related to the purchase of fuel oil from Petroecuador. In particular, Vitol and
Ecuadorian Official 1 discussed having Petroecuador contract with State-Owned Entity for the
project, with Vitol contracting with State-Owned Entity on back-to-back terms, thereby
bypassing a competitive tendering process.

59. In connection with that project, in or about 2016, Vitol, through its employees and
agents, including Aguilar and Ecuador Consultant 1, agreed that Ecuadorian Official 1 would
cause Petroecuador to award a contract for the purchase of fuel oil to State-Owned Entity (the
âFuel Oil Contractâ) for the ultimate benefit of Vitol and its related entities. Vitol, through its
employees and agents, including Aguilar, Ecuador Consultant 1 and Ecuador Consultant 2,
further agreed that Consulting Company, an entity the identity of which is known to the United
States and to the Company and which was owned by Ecuador Consultant 1 and Ecuador
Consultant 2, would pay bribes to Ecuadorian officials in exchange for Ecuadorian Official 1âs
efforts to facilitate the award of the Fuel Oil Contract to State-Owned Entity for the benefit of
Vitol.

60. Specifically, Aguilar, Ecuador Consultant 1 and Ecuador Consultant 2 agreed that
Vitol would pay Ecuador Consultant 1 and Ecuador Consultant 2 a per-barrel commission for
fuel oil provided to Vitol in connection with the Fuel Oil Contract, and that Ecuador Consultant
1 and Ecuador Consultant 2 would use a portion of those funds to pay bribes to Ecuadorian
officials on Vitolâs behalf. Aguilar advised Ecuador Consultant 1 and Ecuador Consultant 2 that

the payments on behalf of Vitol would be made from Intermediary 1 to hide the payments.

A-16
61. On or about December 6, 2016, Petroecuador and State-Owned Entity formally
entered into the Fuel Oil Contract, under which Petroecuador agreed to supply State-Owned
Entity with fuel oil over a period of 30 months in exchange for a $300 million prepayment made
by the Vitol Group at a discount rate of 6.85 percent per year.

62. On or about March 7, 2018, Ecuador Consultant 2 sent Intermediary 1 an email
attaching 39 sham invoices from Consulting Company to a shell company controlled by
Intermediary 1, which were dated in and about and between January 2017 and January 2018.
Intermediary 1 forwarded that email to Aguilar on or about March 7, 2018, telling Aguilar, in
Spanish, that he had received the attached invoices for consulting services from âlos
Equatorenosâ and asked Aguilar how he should proceed.

63. On or about April 20, 2018, Vitol S.A. wired approximately $1,113,200 through a
correspondent bank account located in the United States, to a bank account located in Curagao in
the name of a shell company controlled by Intermediary 1.

64. Also on or about April 20, 2018, Vitol S.A. wired approximately $750,000
through a correspondent bank account located in the United States, to a bank account located in
Curacao in the name of a shell company controlled by Intermediary 1.

65. On or about May 18, 2018, Intermediary 1 sent an email to an email account with
a pseudonym used by Aguilar indicating that Intermediary 1 had received several invoices from
âEcuadorâ totaling approximately $1.4 million, of which $510,000 had been paid, and asking
Aguilar whether to pay the invoices. Aguilar responded on the same day, using his
pseudonymous email address, and instructed Intermediary 1 to make payments of up to $150,000

every fifteen days.

A-17
66. On or about and between May 28, 2018 and June 25, 2018, Intermediary 1 wired
three payments totaling approximately â¬201,306 Euro and one payment totaling approximately
$19,283 from a shell company controlled by Intermediary 1 to bank accounts for Consulting
Company located in the Cayman Islands and Curagao that were controlled by Ecuador
Consultant 1 and Ecuador Consultant 2.

67. On or about July 5, 2018, Ecuador Consultant 1 and Ecuador Consultant 2 sent
instructions to a bank to wire approximately $225,000 from an account owned by Ecuador
Consultant 1 and Ecuador Consultant 2 in the Cayman Islands, through a correspondent bank
account located in New York, New York, to an account located in Portugal for the benefit of
Ecuadorian Official 1.

B. Bribes to Mexican Officials

68. In addition, from at least in or about and between 2015 and 2020, Vitol, through
its employees and agents, used Intermediary 1 to make bribe payments to Mexican officials to
receive inside information and obtain business.

69. For example, in or about 2018, Vitol paid bribes to a Mexican official at a wholly-
owned PEMEX subsidiary in order to receive confidential, inside information to help obtain a
contract with the PEMEX subsidiary. To effectuate the bribe payments, Vitol caused two
Mexican entities to execute sham consulting agreements with shell companies controlled by
Intermediary 1.

70. Pursuant to the sham consulting agreements, the Vitol trader subsequently caused
the Mexican entities to create fake invoices that the Vitol trader sent to Intermediary 1. Using
the fake invoices to justify the payments, Intermediary 1 wired bribe payments to bank accounts

controlled by the Mexican entities for the ultimate benefit of the Mexican official.

CORPORATE COMPLIANCE PROGRAM

In order to address any deficiencies in their internal controls, compliance codes, policies,
and procedures regarding compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (ââFCPAâ), 15 U.S.C.
Â§Â§ 78dd-1, ef seg., and other applicable anti-corruption laws, Vitol Inc. and Vitol S.A.
(collectively, the âCompaniesâ), on behalf of themselves and their subsidiaries and affiliates, agree
to continue to conduct, in a manner consistent with all of their obligations under this Agreement,
appropriate reviews of their existing internal controls, policies, and procedures.

Where necessary and appropriate, the Companies agree to adopt new, or to modify their
existing compliance programs, including internal controls, compliance policies, and procedures in
order to ensure that they maintain: (a) an effective system of internal accounting controls designed
to ensure the making and keeping of fair and accurate books, records, and accounts; and (b) a
rigorous anti-corruption compliance program that incorporates relevant internal accounting
controls, as well as policies and procedures designed to effectively detect and deter violations of
the FCPA and other applicable anti-corruption laws. At a minimum, this should include, but not
be limited to, the following elements to the extent they are not already part of the Companiesâ
existing internal controls, compliance codes, policies, and procedures:

Commitment to Compliance

1. The Companies will ensure that their directors and senior management provide
strong, explicit, and visible support and commitment to their corporate policies against violations
of the anti-corruption laws and their compliance codes, and demonstrate rigorous adherence by

example. The Companies will also ensure that middle management, in turn, reinforce those

C-1
standards and encourage employees to abide by them. The Companies will create and foster a
culture of ethics and compliance with the law in their day-to-day operations at all levels of the
Companies.

Policies and Procedures

2. The Companies will develop and promulgate a clearly articulated and visible
corporate policy against violations of the FCPA and other applicable foreign law counterparts
(collectively, the âanti-corruption lawsââ), which policy shall be memorialized in a written
compliance code.

3. The Companies will develop and promulgate compliance policies and procedures
designed to reduce the prospect of violations of the anti-corruption laws and the Companiesâ
compliance codes, and the Companies will take appropriate measures to encourage and support
the observance of ethics and compliance policies and procedures against violation of the anti-
corruption laws by personnel at all levels of the Companies. These anti-corruption policies and
procedures shall apply to all directors, officers, and employees and, where necessary and
appropriate, outside parties acting on behalf of the Companies in a foreign jurisdiction,
including, but not limited to, agents and intermediaries, consultants, representatives, distributors,
teaming partners, contractors and suppliers, consortia, and joint venture partners (collectively,
âagents and business partnersâ). The Companies shall notify all employees that compliance with
the policies and procedures is the duty of individuals at all levels of the Companies. Such
policies and procedures shall address:

a. gifts;

b. hospitality, entertainment, and expenses;

C-2
Cc. customer travel;

d. political contributions;
e. charitable donations and sponsorships;
f. facilitation payments; and
g. solicitation and extortion.
4. The Companies will ensure that they have a system of financial and accounting

procedures, including a system of internal controls, reasonably designed to ensure the
maintenance of fair and accurate books, records, and accounts. This system shall be designed to
provide reasonable assurances that:

a. transactions are executed in accordance with managementâs general or
specific authorization;

b. transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles or any other criteria
applicable to such statements, and to maintain accountability for assets;

c. access to assets is permitted only in accordance with managementâs general
or specific authorization; and

d. the recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets
at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences.

Periodic Risk-Based Review
5. The Companies will develop these compliance policies and procedures on the
basis of a periodic risk assessment addressing the individual circumstances of the Companies, in

particular the foreign bribery risks facing the Companies, including, but not limited to, its

C-3
geographical organization, interactions with various types and levels of government officials,
industrial sectors of operation, potential clients and business partners, use of third parties, gifts,
travel and entertainment expenses, charitable and political donations, involvement in joint
venture arrangements, importance of licenses and permits in the Companiesâ operations, degree
of governmental oversight and inspection, and volume and importance of goods and personnel
clearing through customs and immigration.

6. The Companies shall review their anti-corruption compliance policies and
procedures no less than annually and update them as appropriate to ensure their continued
effectiveness, taking into account relevant developments in the field and evolving international
and industry standards.

Proper Oversight and Independence

7. The Companies will assign responsibility to one or more senior corporate
executives of the Companies for the implementation and oversight of the Companiesâ anti-
corruption compliance codes, policies, and procedures. Such corporate official(s) shall have the
authority to report directly to independent monitoring bodies, including internal audit, the
Companiesâ Boards of Directors, or any appropriate committee of the Board of Directors, and
shall have an adequate level of stature and autonomy from management as well as sufficient
resources and authority to maintain such autonomy.

Training and Guidance

8. The Companies will implement mechanisms designed to ensure that their anti-

corruption compliance codes, policies, and procedures are effectively communicated to all

directors, officers, employees, and, where necessary and appropriate, agents and business

C-4
partners. These mechanisms shall include: (a) periodic training for all directors and officers, all
employees in positions of leadership or trust, positions that require such training (e.g., internal
audit, sales, legal, compliance, finance), or positions that otherwise pose a corruption risk to the
Companies, and, where necessary and appropriate, agents and business partners; and (b)
corresponding certifications by all such directors, officers, employees, agents, and business
partners, certifying compliance with the training requirements. The Companies will conduct
training in a manner tailored to the audienceâs size, sophistication, or subject matter expertise
and, where appropriate, will discuss prior compliance incidents.

9. The Companies will maintain, or where necessary establish, an effective system
for providing guidance and advice to directors, officers, employees, and, where necessary and
appropriate, agents and business partners, on complying with the Companiesâ anti-corruption
compliance codes, policies, and procedures, including when they need advice on an urgent basis
or in any foreign jurisdiction in which the Companies operate.

Internal Reporting and Investigation

10. The Companies will maintain, or where necessary establish, an effective system
for internal and, where possible, confidential reporting by, and protection of, directors, officers,
employees, and, where appropriate, agents and business partners concerning violations of the
anti-corruption laws or the Companiesâ anti-corruption compliance codes, policies, and
procedures.

11. The Companies will maintain, or where necessary establish, an effective and
reliable process with sufficient resources for responding to, investigating, and documenting

allegations of violations of the anti-corruption laws or the Companiesâ anti-corruption

C-5
compliance codes, policies, and procedures. The Companies will handle the investigations of
such complaints in an effective manner, including routing the complaints to proper personnel,
conducting timely and thorough investigations, and following up with appropriate discipline
where necessary.

Enforcement and Discipline

12. The Companies will implement mechanisms designed to effectively enforce their
compliance codes, policies, and procedures, including appropriately incentivizing compliance
and disciplining violations.

13. The Companies will institute appropriate disciplinary procedures to address,
among other things, violations of the anti-corruption laws and the Companiesâ anti-corruption
compliance codes, policies, and procedures by the Companiesâ directors, officers, and
employees. Such procedures should be applied consistently, fairly and in a manner
commensurate with the violation, regardless of the position held by, or perceived importance of,
the director, officer, or employee. The Companies shall implement procedures to ensure that
where misconduct is discovered, reasonable steps are taken to remedy the harm resulting from
such misconduct, and to ensure that appropriate steps are taken to prevent further similar
misconduct, including assessing the internal controls, compliance codes, policies, and procedures
and making modifications necessary to ensure the overall anti-corruption compliance program is

effective.

C-6
Third-Party Relationships
14. The Companies will institute appropriate risk-based due diligence and compliance
requirements pertaining to the retention and oversight of all agents and business partners,
including:

a. properly documented due diligence pertaining to the hiring and appropriate
and regular oversight of agents and business partners;

b. informing agents and business partners of the Companiesâ commitment to
abiding by anti-corruption laws, and of the Companiesâ anti-corruption compliance codes, policies,
and procedures; and

c. seeking a reciprocal commitment from agents and business partners. The
Companies will understand and record the business rationale for using a third party in a transaction,
and will conduct adequate due diligence with respect to the risks posed by a third-party partner
such as a third-party partnerâs reputations and relationships, if any, with foreign officials. The
Companies will ensure that contract terms with third parties specifically describe the services to
be performed, that the third party is actually performing the described work, and that its
compensation is commensurate with the work being provided in that industry and geographical
region. The Companies will engage in ongoing monitoring of third-party relationships through
updated due diligence, training, audits, and/or annual compliance certifications by the third party.

15. Where necessary and appropriate, the Companies will include standard provisions
in agreements, contracts, and renewals thereof with all agents and business partners that are
reasonably calculated to prevent violations of the anti-corruption laws, which may, depending

upon the circumstances, include: (a) anti-corruption representations and undertakings relating to

C-7
compliance with the anti-corruption laws; (b) rights to conduct audits of the books, records, and
accounts of the agent or business partner to ensure compliance with the foregoing; and (c) rights
to terminate an agent or business partner as a result of any breach of the anti-corruption laws, the
Companiesâ compliance codes, policies, or procedures, or the representations and undertakings
related to such matters.

Mergers and Acquisitions

16. The Companies will develop and implement policies and procedures for mergers
and acquisitions requiring that the Companies conduct appropriate risk-based due diligence on
potential new business entities, including appropriate FCPA and anti-corruption due diligence by
legal, accounting, and compliance personnel.

17. The Companies will ensure that the Companiesâ compliance codes, policies, and
procedures regarding the anti-corruption laws apply as quickly as is practicable to newly
acquired businesses or entities merged with the Companies and will promptly:

a. train the directors, officers, employees, agents, and business partners
consistent with Paragraphs 8 and 9 above on the anti-corruption laws and the Companiesâ
compliance codes, policies, and procedures regarding anti-corruption laws; and

b. where warranted, conduct an FCPA-specific audit of all newly acquired or
merged businesses as quickly as practicable.

Monitoring, Testing, and Remediation

18. In order to ensure that their compliance programs do not become stale, the

Companies will conduct periodic reviews and testing of their anti-corruption compliance codes,

policies, and procedures designed to evaluate and improve their effectiveness in preventing and

C-8
detecting violations of anti-corruption laws and the Companiesâ anti-corruption codes, policies,
and procedures, taking into account relevant developments in the field and evolving international
and industry standards. The Companies will ensure that compliance and control personnel have
sufficient direct or indirect access to relevant sources of data to allow for timely and effective
monitoring and/or testing of transactions. Based on such review and testing and their analysis of
any prior misconduct, the Companies will conduct a thoughtful root cause analysis and timely

and appropriately remediate to address the root causes.

REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

Vitol Inc. and Vitol S.A. (collectively, the âCompaniesââ) agree that they will report to the
Fraud Section and the Office periodically, at no less than twelve-month intervals during a three-
year term, regarding remediation and implementation of the compliance program and internal
controls, policies, and procedures described in Attachment C. During this three-year period, the
Companies shall: (1) conduct an initial review and submit an initial report, and (2) conduct and
prepare at least two (2) follow-up reviews and reports, as described below:

a. By no later than one year from the date this Agreement is executed, the
Companies shall submit to the Fraud Section and the Office a written report setting forth a
complete description of its remediation efforts to date, its proposals reasonably designed to
improve the Companiesâ internal controls, policies, and procedures for ensuring compliance with
the FCPA and other applicable anti-corruption laws, and the proposed scope of the subsequent
reviews. The report shall be transmitted to Chief - FCPA Unit, Fraud Section, Criminal
Division, U.S. Department of Justice, 1400 New York Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20530; and
Chief, Business and Securities Fraud Section, United States Attorneyâs Office for the Eastern
District of New York, 271 Cadman Plaza East, Brooklyn, New York 11201. The Companies
may extend the time period for issuance of the report with prior written approval of the Fraud
Section and the Office.
b. The Companies shall undertake at least two follow-up reviews,

incorporating the Fraud Sectionâs and the Officeâs views on the Companiesâ prior reviews and

reports, to further monitor and assess whether the Companiesâ policies and procedures are

D-1
reasonably designed to detect and prevent violations of the FCPA and other applicable anti-
corruption laws.

c. The first follow-up review and report shall be completed by no later than
one year after the initial review. The second follow-up review and report shall be completed by
no later than one year after the completion of the preceding follow-up review. The final follow-
up review and report shall be completed and delivered to the Fraud Section and the Office no
later than thirty days before the end of the Term.

d. The reports will likely include proprietary, financial, confidential, and
competitive business information. Moreover, public disclosure of the reports could discourage
cooperation, impede pending or potential government investigations and thus undermine the
objectives of the reporting requirement. For these reasons, among others, the reports and the
contents thereof are intended to remain and shall remain non-public, except as otherwise agreed
to by the parties in writing, or except to the extent that the Fraud Section and the Office
determine in their sole discretion that disclosure would be in furtherance of the Fraud Sectionâs
and the Officeâs discharge of their duties and responsibilities or is otherwise required by law.

e. The Companies may extend the time period for submission of any of the

follow-up reports with prior written approval of the Fraud Section and the Office.
