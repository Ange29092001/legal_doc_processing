Overview of the Bribery Scheme

22. Between 2002 and 2009, Alstom, its subsidiaries, and Marubeni (the
âConsortiumâ) partnered to bid on and carry out various power projects in Indonesia through
PLN, including the Tarahan Project and the Muara Tawar Projects. The Consortium retained
several consultants, including Consultant A and Consultant B, to assist them in obtaining the
contracts for the power projects in Indonesia, including the Tarahan Project and Muara Tawar
Projects. The consultantsâ primary purpose was not to provide legitimate consulting services to
the Consortium but was instead to pay bribes to Indonesian officials who had the ability to
influence the award of the contracts.

23. The Consortium first retained Consultant A in connection with the Tarahan
Project in or around late 2002. Consultant A was to receive a commission from the Consortium
based on the overall value that each would receive from the Tarahan Project contract, from
which Consultant A was expected to pay bribes to Indonesian officials. However, through the
course of 2003, MOENAF, SULIANTO, KUSUNOKI, and other executives and employees of
the Consortium came to the conclusion that Consultant A was not effectively bribing key
Indonesian officials. Accordingly, in or around September or October 2003, MOENAF,
SULIANTO, KUSUNOKI, and other executives and employees of the Consortium informed
Consultant A that Consultant A would be responsible only for paying bribes to Official 1 and

that the Consortium would retain another consultant to pay bribes to PLN officials. Shortly

thereafter, the Consortium sent Consultant A amended consulting agreements, reducing the
Case 3:15-cr-00212-IBA Documents Filed Q2/26/15 Page 9 of 35

amount of Consultant Aâs commission to reflect Consultant Aâs reduced responsibilities.
Around the same time, the Consortium also retained Consultant B to bribe PLN officials in
connection with their efforts to secure the Tarahan Project contract and the Muara Tawar
Projects contracts.

24. The Consortium was ultimately awarded the Tarahan Project and Muara Tawar
Project contracts and made payments to Consultants A and B for the purpose of paying
Indonesian government officials, including Official 1, Official 2, Official 3, and Official 4, in
exchange for their assistance in awarding the Tarahan Project and the Muara Tawar Projects
contracts to the Consortium.

25. From in or around 2002, and continuing through in or around 2009, in the District
of Connecticut, and elsewhere, KUSUNOKI, MOENAF, and SULIANTO did willfully, that is,
with the intent to further the objects of the conspiracy, and knowingly conspire, confederate and

others, in violation of Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2(a); and
b. with others known and unknown to the Grand Jury, while in the territory of the

authorization of the giving of anything of value to a foreign official and to a person, while

the Rep. I spoke with Fred [Pierucci] right after he sent the note and we have concerns about 1)

Jkt time.â

42. On or about September 4, 2002, MOENAF sent an e-mail to Rothschild, copying
Pierucci, in which MOENAF stated, â[W]e have met [Official 1] to confirm whether he is
comfortable with your suggested approach on Representation issue (through [Consultant
A])....Again, from my point of view whichever approach taken on the Representation issue,
must assure the coverage of Palembang [the city in Indonesia where the evaluation committee
was located]. You need to be confident that [Consultant A] could do this since he â being the
one who can make the âcommitmentâ â will have to take over the lead role from us in
Palembang.â

43. In or around late 2002, the Consortium retained Consultant A, agreeing to pay

one of the Muara Tawar Projects, including whether to retain Consultant A in connection with

precisely he is the Vice Chairman of Commission VIII, a commission in charge of handling
Power issues..,.Besides his function in the Parliament, he has long well established relationship

with [Official 2] (PLN President Director), As a Vice Chairman of Commission VIII he

 
Case 223-cr-00212-IBA DBocumentS Filed 02/26/15 Page 15 of 35

certainly have an influence in PLN. He is not an agent but one of the players....[L]ooking in to
[Consultant Aâs] performance in Tarahan, we need to think twice prior taking him into
consideration..,.As the [Tarahan] project proceed, it shown that [Consultant A] has been unable
to fulfil his tasks and our expectation, he has no grip on PLN Tender team at all. Basically, his
function is more or less similar to cashier which I feel we pay too much....As you know, I have
set an appointment to meet [Official 2] tomorrow moming to find out who would be his
recommended agent, the one that PLN can really feel comfortable with.â

45. On or about December 3, 2002, Hoskins sent an e-mail to an executive at Alstom,
stating, âWill call you after I get feedback from Reza [MOENAF] on his meeting tomorrow with
[Official 2]. At this stage Reza [MOENAF] does not support appointment of [Consultant A] for
MT [Muara Tawar] but believes [Official 1] to be an important part of the jigsaw.â

46. On or about December 4, 2002, Hoskins forwarded to MOENAF the e-mail
described in Paragraph 45 above, stating, âAs discussed.â

47. On or about January 3, 2003, an executive at Alstom Prom sent an e-mail to
Hoskins, copying another Alstom Prom employee, regarding the approval of the consultancy
agreement with Consultant A, stating, â[Consultant A] sent me the completed âAgent Profileâ for
his very small company in Baltimore, Maryland, with branch office in Washington....1
understand, that the Tarahan job is boiler supply from the US to Indonesia. As I said before, it
would make more sens[e] to have an agent in Indonesia, where [Consultant Aâs] company has
obviously an office. As you know, we do not like to have a US domiciliated company as a
consultant, with payment in the US, and most probably in USD.â

48. On or about January 15, 2003, Hoskins responded to the e-mail referenced in

Paragraph 47 above, stating, âI talked to Reza [MOENAF] and his financial controller [] on this

15
Case 223-cr-00212-IBA DBocumentS Filed Of/26/15 Page 16 of 35

subject to establish whether they could implement an agreement locally in Indonesia. They were
uneasy about dealing with a local company but thought an arrangement with Singapore may
work. Reza is going to check with [Consultant A] to see if he has a company in Singapore.â

49, On or about June 5, 2003, Alstom Employee A sent an e-mail to SULIANTO
regarding one of the Muara Tawar Projects and discussing various agents that Alstom could

directly....Finally, I have not been able to get a contract out of Marubeni even though they keep
saying there is no problem. They also told [Official 2] that they do not have a firm commitment
to me yet and that has not sat well with [Official 1]. So please give them a nodge. Hopefully we

expect with 2-3%, and âprorateâ ToP [terms of payment]. He shook his head when he heard that
the ToP is spread in three and half year. Lets ask our self what have we done which showed our
