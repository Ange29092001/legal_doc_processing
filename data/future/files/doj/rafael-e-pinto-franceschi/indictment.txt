INDICTMENT
THE GRAND JURY CHARGES:

COUNT ONE
(Conspiracy â 18 U.S.C. Â§ 371)

Introduction
At all relevant times, unless otherwise specified:
1, The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (âFCPAâ), as amended,
Title 15, United States Code, Sections 78dd-1, et seq., was enacted by Congress for
the purpose of, among other things, making it unlawful to act corruptly in furtherance
of an offer, promise, authorization, or payment of money or anything of value,

directly or indirectly, to a foreign official for the purpose of obtaining or retaining
business for, or directing business to, any person.

2. Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (ââPDVSAâ) was the Venezuelan state-
owned and state-controlled oil company. PDVSA and its subsidiaries were
responsible for the exploration, production, refining, transportation, and trade in
energy resources in Venezuela and provided funding for other operations of the
Venezuelan government. PDVSA Services, Inc. (âPSIâ) was the U.S.-based affiliate
of PDVSA located in Houston, Texas, that, at various times, was responsible for
international purchasing on behalf of PDVSA. Bariven S.A. was the PDVSA
procurement subsidiary responsible for equipment purchases. PDVSA and its
wholly owned subsidiaries, including PSI and Bariven S.A. (hereinafter collectively
referred to as âPDVSAâ) were âinstrumentalitiesâ of the Venezuelan government as
that term is used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-
2(h)(2)(A). PDVSA officers and employees were âforeign officialsâ as that term is
used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Sections 78dd-2(h)(2)(A).

3. PDVSA awarded contracts for energy services and equipment in a
number of ways, including through a competitive bidding process. In some
instances, PDVSA also awarded sole source contracts.

4. âCompany A,â a company whose identity is known to the Grand Jury,
was a U.S.-based supplier of industrial equipment that was incorporated in the

United States. Company A was thus a âdomestic concernâ as that term is used in
the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2(h)(1). Company A and its
affiliates were PDVSAâs exclusive supplier of heavy equipment manufactured by
another company headquartered in the United States.

5. âCompany Aâs Affiliate,â a company whose identity is known to the
Grand Jury, was a Curacao-based company affiliated with Company A.

The Defendants and Their Co-Conspirators

6. Defendant RAFAEL ENRIQUE PINTO FRANCESCHI
(âPINTOâ) was a Venezuelan national and resident of the United States. PINTO
was employed as a sales representative for Company A. PINTO was thus a
âdomestic concernâ and an officer, director, employee, and agent of a âdomestic
concern,â and a stockholder thereof acting on behalf of a âdomestic concernâ as
those terms are used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-
2(h)(1).

7. Defendant FRANZ HERMAN MULLER HUBER (âMULLERâ)
was a Venezuelan national and resident of the United States. MULLER was the
President of Company A. MULLER was thus a âdomestic concernâ and an officer,
director, employee, and agent of a âdomestic concern,â and a stockholder thereof
acting on behalf of a âdomestic concernâ as those terms are used in the FCPA, Title

15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2(h)(1).
8. Jose Orlando Camacho (âCamachoâ), who has been charged separately,
was a dual Venezuelan and United States citizen who resided in the Southern District
of Texas. Between approximately 2004 and 2013, Camacho was employed by
PDVSA. During that time, Camacho held a number of positions related to
procurement, including serving as a sourcing supervisor and planning and
procurement manager for PSI.

9. Ivan Alexis Guedez (ââGuedezâ), who has been charged separately, was
a United States citizen who resided in the Southern District of Texas. Between
approximately 2006 and 2011, Guedez was employed by PSI. During that time,
Guedez held a number of positions related to procurement, including serving as the
purchasing manager for PSI.

10. âOfficial A,â an individual whose identity is known to the Grand Jury,
was a Venezuelan national and resident of the United States. Until approximately
2009 or 2010, Official A was employed by PSI as a buyer.

11. During their employment at PDVSA, Camacho, Guedez, and Official
A (together the âPDVSA officialsâ) were each a âforeign officialâ as that term is
used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2(h)(2)(A).

Other Entities
12. âShell Company A.â whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was a

company organized under the laws of Panama.
13. The âSwiss Accountâ was a bank account in Switzerland in the name
of Shell Company A.

14. The âPanama Accountâ was a bank account in Panama held in the name
of one of PINTOâs associates.

15. The âPuerto Rico Accountâ was a bank account in Puerto Rico in the
name of a corporate entity whose identity is known to the Grand Jury.

The Conspiracy

16. Beginning in or around 2009 and continuing through at least 2013, in

the Southern District of Texas, and elsewhere, the defendants,

RAFAEL ENRIQUE PINTO FRANCESCHI and
FRANZ HERMAN MULLER HUBER

did willfully and knowingly conspire, confederate, and agree with others known and
unknown to the Grand Jury to commit offenses against the United States, that is, to
willfully make use of the mails and means and instrumentalities of interstate
commerce corruptly in furtherance of an offer, payment, promise to pay, and
authorization of the payment of any money, offer, gift, promise to give, and
authorization of the giving of anything of value to a foreign official and to a person,
while knowing that all and a portion of such money and thing of value would be and
had been offered, given, and promised to a foreign official, for purposes of: (i)
influencing acts and decisions of such foreign official in his official capacity; (ii)

inducing such foreign official to do and omit to do acts in violation of the lawful

5
duty of such official; (111) securing an improper advantage; and (iv) inducing such
foreign official to use his influence with a foreign government and agencies and
instrumentalities thereof to affect and influence acts and decisions of such
government and agencies and instrumentalities, in order to assist Company A,
PINTO, and MULLER in obtaining and retaining business for and with, and
directing business to, Company A and others, in violation of the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2(a).
Manner and Means of the Conspiracy

17. The manner and means by which PINTO, MULLER, and their co-
conspirators sought to accomplish the purpose of the conspiracy included, among
other things, the following, while in the Southern District of Texas and elsewhere:

18. PINTO and the PDVSA officials agreed that in exchange for bribe
payments, which they called âcommissions,â the PDVSA officials would assist
Company A in its business with PDVSA. PINTO, and later MULLER, would
receive kickbacks as part of the scheme. They agreed that they would take three
percent of each payment that PDVSA made to Company A and split it equally
amongst themselves.

19. PINTO and MULLER, together with others, paid bribes to the
PDVSA officials through the use of interstate and foreign wires in order to secure

an improper advantage, influence acts and decisions of the PDVSA officials in their
official capacities, and induce the PDVSA officials to do and omit to do certain acts,
including, but not limited to:
a. taking steps to ensure that end users at PDVSA would request a certain
brand of equipment for which Company A was a distributor, resulting
in additional business from PDVSA for Company A;

b. providing PINTO with inside information regarding PDVSA;

c. assisting Company A in receiving payment for previously awarded
PDVSA business, including by requesting payment priority for
Company A over other vendors.

20. Beginning in or around 2009 and continuing through at least 2013, the
conspirators agreed that three percent of every payment made by PDVSA to
Company A would be split as bribe payments and kickbacks as follows:

a. initially, as an even four-way split between bribes to Camacho, Guedez,

and Official A, and kickbacks to PINTO;

b. after Official Aâs employment at PDVSA was terminated in

approximately 2009 or 2010, as an even three-way split between
Camacho, Guedez, and PINTO; and
Cc. from in or around March 2012, MULLER received 0.5% while

Camacho, Guedez, and PINTO evenly split the remaining 2.5%.
21. MULLER, together with others, caused bribe payments to be wired
from Company Aâs Affiliateâs bank account in Curacao to the Swiss Account.
22. Guedez maintained a spreadsheet tracking the amounts paid into the
Swiss Account from Company Aâs Affiliate, and the amounts disbursed from the
Swiss Account to the foreign officials, PINTO, and MULLER.
23. PINTO and MULLER, together with others, attempted to conceal, and
did in fact conceal, the nature, source, and ownership of the bribes and kickbacks,
by:
a. Providing Guedez and Camacho with information regarding PDVSAâs
payments to Company A, which Guedez used to create false invoices in
the name of Shell Company A;

b. Causing invoices from Shell Company A to be paid, despite knowing that
Shell Company A had not provided any services to Company A or
Company Aâs Affiliate;

c. Communicating about the scheme using their personal email accounts,

rather than their official Company A email accounts.

24. Over the course of the scheme, PINTO and MULLER caused

Company Aâs Affiliate to wire in excess of $3 million to the Swiss Account.
Overt Acts

25. In furtherance of the conspiracy and to achieve the objects thereof, at
least one of the co-conspirators committed or caused to be committed, in the
Southern District of Texas and elsewhere, at least one of the following overt acts,
among others:

26. In or about 2009, PINTO, Camacho, Guedez, and Official A met at a
restaurant on Westheimer Road in Houston, Texas, and discussed and agreed upon
the bribery scheme.

27. Onor about July 1, 2009, PINTO sent an email to Camacho, requesting
that Camacho forward the email on to Official A and discussing purchase orders that
were, as translated into English, âunder the commission agreement to date. . .â

28. On or about August 3, 2010, PINTO sent an email to Camacho and
Guedez, listing purchase orders for which Company A had been paid and noting the
three-percent calculation to be paid as part of the scheme. In the email, PINTO
distinguished between one invoice, for which âel pelonâ (a nickname for Official A)
should receive a portion of the commission payment, and two invoices for which âel
pelonâ was not to receive a portion.

29. Onor about February 16, 2011, PINTO sent an email to Camacho and
Guedez listing purchase orders for which Company A had been paid and noting the

three-percent calculation for this group of invoices as $167,601.99.
30. On or about February 21, 2011, Guedez emailed MULLER a false
invoice in the amount of $167,601.99 in the name of Shell Company A. The invoice
falsely stated, in Spanish, that Shell Company A had performed consulting services
for Company Aâs Affiliate and directed Company Aâs Affiliate to send payment to
the Swiss Account, notwithstanding that Shell Company A had not performed any
services for Company A or Company Aâs Affiliate.

31. On or about March 10, 2011, MULLER caused $167,601.99 to be
wired to the Swiss Account.

32. On or about April 2, 2012, PINTO sent an email to Camacho and
Guedez listing purchase orders for which Company A had been paid and noting the
three-percent calculation for this group of invoices as $159,542.98.

33. Onor about April 3, 2012, Guedez emailed MULLER a false invoice
in the amount of $159,542.98 in the name of Shell Company A. The invoice falsely
stated, in Spanish, that Shell Company A had performed consulting services for
Company Aâs Affiliate and directed Company Aâs Affiliate to send payment to the
Swiss Account, notwithstanding that Shell Company A had not performed any
services for Company A or Company Aâs Affiliate.

34. Onor about April 10, 2012, MULLER caused $159,542.98 to be sent

to the Swiss Account.

10
35. Onor about December 2, 2012, PINTO sent an email to Camacho and
Guedez listing purchase orders for which Company A had been paid and noting the
three-percent calculation for this group of invoices as $62,217.17.

36. On or about December 26, 2012, Guedez emailed MULLER a false
invoice in the amount of $62,217.17 in the name of Shell Company A. The invoice
falsely stated, in Spanish, that Shell Company A had performed consulting services
for Company Aâs Affiliate and directed Company Aâs Affiliate to send payment to
the Swiss Account, notwithstanding that Shell Company A had not performed any
services for Company A or Company Aâs Affiliate. |

37. Onor about January 16, 2013, MULLER caused $62,217.17 to be sent
to the Swiss Account.

38, On or about February 18, 2013, PINTO sent an email to Camacho and
Guedez listing the payments made by PDVSA to Company A, the payments made
by Company Aâs Affiliate to the Swiss Account, and the payments owed to each
individual.

39. On or about August 20, 2014, PINTO forwarded the email described
in paragraph 38 to Camacho.

business for, or directing business to, any person.

2. Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (âPDVSAâ) was the Venezuelan state-
owned and state-controlled oil company. PDVSA and its subsidiaries were
responsible for the exploration, production, refining, transportation, and trade in

that term is used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-
2(h)(2)(A). PDVSA officers and employees were âforeign officialsâ as that term is

instances, PDVSA also awarded sole source contracts.

4. âCompany A,â a company whose identity is known to the Grand Jury,
was a U.S.-based supplier of industrial equipment that was incorporated in the

United States. Company A was thus a âdomestic concernâ as that term is used in

affiliates were PDVSAâs exclusive supplier of heavy equipment manufactured by

the Southern District of Texas, and elsewhere, the defendants,

RAFAEL ENRIQUE PINTO FRANCESCHI and
FRANZ HERMAN MULLER HUBER

did willfully and knowingly conspire, confederate, and agree with others known and
unknown to the Grand Jury to commit offenses against the United States, that is, to
willfully make use of the mails and means and instrumentalities of interstate
commerce corruptly in furtherance of an offer, payment, promise to pay, and
authorization of the payment of any money, offer, gift, promise to give, and
authorization of the giving of anything of value to a foreign official and to a person,
while knowing that all and a portion of such money and thing of value would be and
had been offered, given, and promised to a foreign official, for purposes of: (1)
influencing acts and decisions of such foreign official in his official capacity; (11)

inducing such foreign official to do and omit to do acts in violation of the lawful

5
duty of such official; (111) securing an improper advantage; and (iv) inducing such
foreign official to use his influence with a foreign government and agencies and
instrumentalities thereof to affect and influence acts and decisions of such
government and agencies and instrumentalities, in order to assist Company A,
PINTO, and MULLER in obtaining and retaining business for and with, and
directing business to, Company A and others, in violation of the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2(a).
Manner and Means of the Conspiracy

conspirators sought to accomplish the purpose of the conspiracy included, among
other things, the following, while in the Southern District of Texas and elsewhere:

payments, which they called âcommissions,â the PDVSA officials would assist
Company A in its business with PDVSA. PINTO, and later MULLER, would
receive kickbacks as part of the scheme. They agreed that they would take three
percent of each payment that PDVSA made to Company A and split it equally
amongst themselves.

19. PINTO and MULLER, together with others, paid bribes to the
PDVSA officials through the use of interstate and foreign wires in order to secure

an improper advantage, influence acts and decisions of the PDVSA officials in their

official capacities, and induce the PDVSA officials to do and omit to do certain acts,
including, but not limited to:
a. taking steps to ensure that end users at PDVSA would request a certain
brand of equipment for which Company A was a distributor, resulting
in additional business from PDVSA for Company A;

b. providing PINTO with inside information regarding PDVSA;

C. assisting Company A in receiving payment for previously awarded
PDVSA business, including by requesting payment priority for
Company A over other vendors.

20. Beginning in or around 2009 and continuing through at least 2013, the
conspirators agreed that three percent of every payment made by PDVSA to
Company A would be split as bribe payments and kickbacks as follows:

a. initially, as an even four-way split between bribes to Camacho, Guedez,

and Official A, and kickbacks to PINTO;

b. after Official Aâs employment at PDVSA was terminated in

approximately 2009 or 2010, as an even three-way split between
Camacho, Guedez, and PINTO; and
C. from in or around March 2012, MULLER received 0.5% while

Camacho, Guedez, and PINTO evenly split the remaining 2.5%.
