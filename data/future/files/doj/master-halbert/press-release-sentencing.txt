Micronesian Government Official Sentenced to Prison for Role in Money Laundering Scheme
Involving FCPA Violations

A Micronesian government official was sentenced to 18 months in prison followed by three years of supervised release yesterday for his
participation in a money laundering scheme involving bribes made to corruptly secure engineering and project management contracts from the
government of the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), announced Assistant Attorney
General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division and Special Agent in Charge Eli S. Miranda of the FBIâs Honolulu
Field Office.

Master Halbert, 44, a Micronesian citizen, was sentenced in Honolulu by U.S. District Judge Susan O. Mollway of the District of Hawaii. Halbert
pleaded guilty on April 2 to a one-count information filed in the District of Hawaii charging him with conspiracy to commit money laundering.

According to admissions made as part of his plea agreement, Halbert was a government official in the FSM Department of Transportation,
Communications and Infrastructure who administered FSMâs aviation programs, including the management of its airports. Halbert admitted
that between 2006 and 2016, a Hawaii-based engineering and consulting company owned by Frank James Lyon paid bribes to FSM officials,
including Halbert, to obtain and retain contracts with the FSM government valued at nearly $8 million, in violation of the FCPA. Lyon and
Halbert agreed that these bribe payments would be transported from the United States to the FSM.

Lyon, 53, of Honolulu, Hawaii, pleaded guilty on Jan. 22 to a one-count information filed in the District of Hawaii charging him with conspiracy to
violate the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA and to commit federal program fraud. Lyon was sentenced to serve 30 months in prison on May
13.

The FBI investigated this case. Trial Attorney Katherine Raut of the Criminal Division's Fraud Section is prosecuting the case. The Criminal
Divisionâs Office of International Affairs and the U.S. Department of Transportationâs Office of Inspector General provided significant assistance.

The Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Departmentâs FCPA
enforcement efforts can be found at www. justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.
