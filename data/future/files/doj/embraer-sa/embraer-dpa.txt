DEFERRED PROSECUTION AGREEMENT

Defendant Embraer S.A. (the âCompanyâ), pursuant to authority granted by the
Companyâs Board of Directors, and the United States Department of Justice, Criminal Division,
Fraud Section (the âSectionâ), enter into this deferred prosecution agreement (the âAgreementâ.

Criminal Information and Acceptance of Responsibility

1. The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Section will file the attached
two-count criminal Information in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
Florida charging the Company with (i) one count of conspiracy to commit offenses against the
United States in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 371, that is, to violate the anti-
bribery and books and records provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977
(âFCPAâ), as amended, Title 15, United States Code, Sections 78dd-1, 78m(b)(2)(A), 78m(b)(5),
and 78ff(a); and (ii) one count of violating the internal controls provisions of the FCPA, Title 15,
United States Code, Sections 78m(b)(2)(B), 78m(b)(5), and 78ff(a). In so doing, the Company:

(a) knowingly waives its right to indictment on these charges, as well as all rights to a speedy
 

a

Case &:16-cr-60294.iC Documents Enferec on FLSD Backet TQ/24/2016 Page 2 af 59

trial pursuant to the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, Title 18, United States
Code, Section 3161, and Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 48(b); and (b) knowingly waives
any objection with respect to venue to any charges by the United States arising out of the
conduct described in the attached Statement of Facts and consents to the filing of the
Information, as provided under the terms of this Agreement, in the United States District Court
for the Southern District of Florida. The Section agrees to defer prosecution of the Company
pursuant to the terms and conditions described below.

2. The Company admits, accepts, and acknowledges that it is responsible under
United States law for the acts of its officers, directors, employees, and agents as charged in the
Information, and as set forth in the attached Statement of F acts, and that the allegations described
in the Information and the facts described in the attached Statement of Facts are true and
accurate. Should the Section pursue the prosecution that is deferred by this Agreement, the
Company stipulates to the admissibility of the attached Statement of Facts in any proceeding,
including any trial, guilty plea, or sentencing proceeding, and will not contradict anything in the
Statement of Facts at any such proceeding.

Term of the Agreement

3. This Agreement is effective for a period beginning on the date on which the
Information is filed and ending three years from the later of the date on which the Information is
filed or the date on which the independent compliance monitor (the âMonitorâ) is retained by the
Company, as described in Paragraphs 11-13 below (the âTermâ). The Company agrees,
however, that, in the event the Section determines, in its sole discretion, that the Company has
knowingly violated any provision of this Agreement, an extension or extensions of the Term may

be imposed by the Section, in its sole discretion, for up to a total additional time period of one
2
 

ry

year, without prejudice to the Sectionâs right to proceed as provided in Paragraphs 16-20 below.
Any extension of the Agreement extends all terms of this Agreement, including the terms of the
monitorship in Attachment D, for an equivalent period. Conversely, in the event the Section
finds, in its sole discretion, that there exists a change in circumstances sufficient to eliminate the
need for the monitorship in Attachment D, and that the other provisions of this Agreement have
been satisfied, the Agreement may be terminated early. If the Court rejects the Agreement, all
the provisions of the Agreement shall be deemed null and void, and the Term shall be deemed to
have not begun.

Relevant Considerations

4. The Section enters into this Agreement based on the individual facts and

circumstances presented by this case, including:

(a) the Company did not voluntarily disclose the FCPA violations to the Section; the
investigation of the matter commenced when the Securities and Exchange
Commission (âSECâ) served the Company with a subpoena;

(b) the Company fully cooperated with the Sectionâs investigation and provided all
non-privileged relevant facts known to the Company, including information about
individuals involved in the misconduct, which assisted in the prosecutions of
individuals by foreign authorities for the misconduct described in the attached
Statement of Facts;

(c) the Company had an inadequate compliance program at the time of the criminal
conduct;

(d) the Company now has designed and is implementing a more adequate compliance

program and system of internal accounting controls, has committed to ensuring

that these will be implemented in a manner that satisfies the elements set forth in
Attachment C to this Agreement, and has agreed to engage the Monitor pursuant
to the terms described herein;

the Company has engaged in partial remediation: it has disciplined a number of
Company employees and executives engaged in the misconduct described in the
attached Statement of Facts, but did not discipline a senior executive who was (at
the very least) aware of bribery discussions in emails in 2004 and had oversight
responsibility for the employees engaged in those discussions;

the nature and seriousness of the offense, including its pervasiveness throughout
each of the Companyâs three separate sales divisions and the involvement of high-
level executives in each set of criminal conduct recounted in the attached
Statement of Facts;

the Company has no prior criminal history;

the Company has agreed to continue to cooperate with the Section as set forth in
this Agreement in any investigation of the Company and its officers, directors,
employees, agents, business partners, and consultants relating to violations of the
FCPA;

the Company has agreed to disgorge the profits from the misconduct described in
the attached Statement of Facts to the SEC and to Brazilian authorities;
accordingly, after considering (a) through (i) above, the Company will enter into
the Agreement, pay a criminal penalty of 20% below the low end of United States
Sentencing Guidelines range, and the Monitor will be imposed pursuant to the

terms outlined herein.

or external investigations, about which the Company has any knowledge or about which the

must at all times provide complete, truthful, and accurate information,

c. The Company shall use its best efforts to make available for interviews or

information regarding the matters under investigation.

tangible evidence provided to the Section pursuant to this Agreement, the Company consents to

authorities, including United States authorities and those of a foreign government, as well as the
MDBs, of such materials as the Section, in its sole discretion, shall deem appropriate.

6. In addition to the obligations in Paragraph 5, during the Term, should the
Company learn of credible evidence or allegations of corrupt payments, false books, records, and
accounts, or the failure to implement adequate internal accounting controls, the Company shall
promptly report such evidence or allegations to the Section.

range yields the following analysis:

The Company agrees to pay a monetary penalty in the amount of $107,285,090 to the United
States Treasury no later than five business days after the filing of the Information. The Company
and the Section agree that this penalty is appropriate given the facts and circumstances of this
case, as set forth above. The $107,285,090 penalty is final and shall not be refunded.
Furthermore, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed an agreement by the Section that
$107,285,090 is the maximum penalty that may be imposed in any future prosecution, and the
Section is not precluded from arguing in any future prosecution that the Court should impose a
higher fine, although the Section agrees that under those circumstances, it will recommend to the
Court that any amount paid under this Agreement should be offset against any fine the Court
imposes as part of a future judgment. The Company acknowledges that no tax deduction may be
sought in connection with the payment of any part of this $107,285,090 penalty. The Company
shall not seek or accept directly or indirectly reimbursement or indemnification from any source
with regard to the penalty or disgorgement amounts that the Company pays pursuant to this
Agreement or any other agreement entered into with an enforcement authority or regulator
concerning the facts set forth in the attached Statement of Facts.
Conditional Release from Liability
8. Subject to Paragraph 16-20, the Section agrees, except as provided in this
Agreement, that it will not bring any criminal or civil case against the Company relating to any
. of the conduct described in the attached Statement of Facts or the criminal Information filed
pursuant to this Agreement or for the conduct that the Company disclosed to the Section prior to
the signing of this Agreement. The Section, however, may use any information related to the
conduct described in the attached Statement of Facts against the Company: (a) in a prosecution

for perjury or obstruction of justice; (b) in a prosecution for making a false statement; (c) in a
8
Case &:16-cr-60294.iC Documents Enferec on FLSOD Backet TQ/24/2016 Page 9 af So

prosecution or other proceeding relating to any crime of violence; or (d) in a prosecution or other
proceeding relating to a violation of any provision of Title 26 of the United States Code.
a. This Agreement does not provide any protection against prosecution for
any future conduct by the Company.
b. In addition, this Agreement does not provide any protection against
prosecution of any individuals, regardless of their affiliation with the Company.
Corporate Compliance Program

9. The Company represents that it has implemented and will continue to implement
a compliance and ethics program throughout its operations, including those of its affiliates,
agents, and joint ventures, and those of its contractors and subcontractors whose responsibilities
include interacting with foreign officials or other activities carrying a high risk of corruption,
designed to prevent and detect violations of the FCPA and other applicable anti-corruption laws.

10. In order to address any deficiencies in its internal accounting controls, policies,
and procedures, the Company represents that it has undertaken, and will continue to undertake in
the future, in a manner consistent with all of its obligations under this Agreement, a review of its
existing internal accounting controls, policies, and procedures regarding compliance with the
FCPA and other applicable anti-corruption laws. Where necessary and appropriate, the
Company agrees to adopt a new compliance program, or to modify its existing one, including
internal controls, compliance policies, and procedures in order to ensure that it maintains: (a) an
effective system of internal accounting controls designed to ensure the making and keeping of
fair and accurate books, records, and accounts; and (b) a rigorous anti-corruption compliance
program that incorporates relevant internal accounting controls, as well as policies and

procedures designed to effectively detect and deter violations of the FCPA and other applicable
9
Case O:16-cr-60294-NC Document 2 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/24/2016 Page TO of 59

anti-corruption laws. The compliance program, including the internal accounting controls
system will include, but not be limited to, the minimum elements set forth in Attachment C.
Independent Compliance Monitor

11. Promptly after the Sectionâs selection pursuant to Paragraph 12 below, the
Company agrees to retain a Monitor for the term specified in Paragraph 13. The Monitorâs
duties and authority, and the obligations of the Company with respect to the Monitor and the
Section, are set forth in Attachment D, which is incorporated by reference into this Agreement.
Upon the execution of this Agreement, and after consultation with the Section, the Company will
propose to the Section a pool of three qualified candidates to serve as the Monitor. If the Section
determines, in its sole discretion, that any of the candidates are not, in fact, qualified to serve as
the Monitor, or if the Section, in its sole discretion, is not satisfied with the candidates proposed,
the Section reserves the right to seek additional nominations from the Company.
The parties will endeavor to complete the monitor selection process within sixty days of the
execution of this Agreement. The Monitor candidates or their team members shall have, at a
minimum, the following qualifications:

a. demonstrated expertise with respect to the FCPA and other applicable
anti-corruption laws, including experience counseling on FCPA issues;

b. experience designing and/or reviewing corporate compliance policies,
procedures and internal controls, including FCPA and anti-corruption policies, procedures and
internal controls;

c. the ability to access and deploy resources as necessary to discharge the

Monitorâs duties as described in the Agreement; and

10
Case O:16-cr-60294-NC Document 2 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/24/2016 Page Tl of 59

d. sufficient independence from the Company to ensure effective and
impartial performance of the Monitorâs duties as described in the Agreement.

12. The Section retains the right, in its sole discretion, to choose the Monitor from
among the candidates proposed by the Company, though the Company may express its
preference(s) among the candidates. In the event the Section rejects all proposed Monitors, the
Company shall propose an additional three candidates within twenty business days after
receiving notice of the rejection. This process shall continue until a Monitor acceptable to both
parties is chosen. The Section and the Company will use their best efforts to complete the
selection process within sixty calendar days of the execution of this Agreement. If the Monitor
resigns or is otherwise unable to fulfill his or her obligations as set out herein and in Attachment
D, the Company shall within forty-five (45) business days recommend a pool of three qualified
Monitor candidates from which the Section will choose a replacement.

13. The Monitorâs term shall be three years from the date on which the Monitor is
retained by the Company, subject to extension or early termination as described in Paragraph 3.
The Monitorâs powers, duties, and responsibilities, as well as additional circumstances that may
support an extension of the Monitorâs term, are set forth in Attachment D. The Company agrees
that it will not employ or be affiliated with the Monitor or the Monitorâs firm for a period of not
less than two years from the date on which the Monitorâs term expires. Nor will the Company
discuss with the Monitor or the Monitorâs firm the possibility of further employment or

Deferred Prosecution

14. In consideration of the undertakings agreed to by the Company herein, the
Section agrees that any prosecution of the Company for the conduct set forth in the attached
Statement of Facts be and hereby is deferred for the Term.

15, The Section further agrees that if the Company fully complies with all of its
obligations under this Agreement, the Section will not continue the criminal prosecution against
the Company described in Paragraph | and, at the conclusion of the Term, this Agreement shall
expire. Within six months of the Agreementâs expiration, the Section shall seek dismissal with
prejudice of the criminal Information filed against the Company described in Paragraph 1, and
agrees not to file charges in the future against the Company based on the conduct described in
this Agreement and the attached Statement of Facts.

Breach of the Agreement

16. If, during the Term, the Company (a) commits any felony under U.S. federal law;
(b) provides in connection with this Agreement deliberately false, incomplete, or misleading
information, including in connection with its disclosure of information about individual
culpability; (c) fails to cooperate as set forth in Paragraphs 5 and 6 of this Agreement; (d) fails to
implement a compliance program as set forth in Paragraphs 9 and 10 of this Agreement and
Attachment C; (e) commits any acts that, had they occurred within the jurisdictional reach of the
FCPA, would be a violation of the FCPA; or (f) otherwise fails specifically to perform or to
fulfill completely each of the Companyâs obligations under the Agreement, regardless of whether
the Section becomes aware of such a breach after the Term is complete, the Company shall
thereafter be subject to prosecution for any federal criminal violation of which the Section has

knowledge, including, but not limited to, the charges in the Information described in Paragraph
12
Case O:16-cr-60294-NC Document 2 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/24/2016 Page 13 of 59

1, which may be pursued by the Section in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
Florida or any other appropriate venue. Determination of whether the Company has breached
the Agreement and whether to pursue prosecution of the Company shall be in the Sectionâs sole
discretion. Any such prosecution may be premised on information provided by the Company or
its personnel. Any such prosecution relating to the conduct described in the attached Statement
of Facts or relating to conduct known to the Section prior to the date on which this Agreement
was signed that is not time-barred by the applicable statute of limitations on the date of the
signing of this Agreement may be commenced against the Company, notwithstanding the
expiration of the statute of limitations, between the signing of this Agreement and the expiration
of the Term plus one year. Thus, by signing this Agreement, the Company agrees that the statute
of limitations with respect to any such prosecution that is not time-barred on the date of the
signing of this Agreement shall be tolled for the Term plus one year. In addition, the Company
agrees that the statute of limitations as to any violation of federal law related to corrupt
payments, false books, records, and accounts, or the failure to implement adequate internal
accounting controls, including violation of the anti-bribery or internal controls provisions of the
FCPA or violation of the Travel Act, Title 18, United States Code, Section 1952, that occurs
during the Term will be tolled from the date upon which the violation occurs until the earlier of
the date upon which the Section is made aware of the violation or the duration of the Term plus
five years, and that this period shall be excluded from any calculation of time for purposes of the
application of the statute of limitations.

17. In the event the Section determines that the Company has breached this
Agreement, the Section agrees to provide the Company with written notice prior to instituting

any prosecution resulting from such breach. Within thirty days of receipt of such notice, the
13
Case O:16-cr-60294-NC Document 2 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/24/2016 Page 14 of 59

Company shall have the opportunity to respond to the Section in writing to explain the nature
and circumstances of the breach, as well as the actions the Company has taken to address and
remediate the situation, which the Section shall consider in determining whether to pursue
prosecution of the Company.

18. In the event that the Section determines that the Company has breached this
Agreement: (a) all statements made by or on behalf of the Company to the Section or to the
Court, including the attached Statement of Facts, and any testimony given by the Company
before a grand jury, a court, or any tribunal, or at any legislative hearings, whether prior or
subsequent to this Agreement, and any leads derived from such statements or testimony, shall be
admissible in evidence in any and all criminal proceedings brought by the Section against the
Company; and (b) the Company shall not assert any claim under the United States Constitution,
Rule 1 1(f) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rule 410 of the Federal Rules of
Evidence, or any other federal rule that any such statements or testimony made by or on behalf of
the Company prior or subsequent to this Agreement, or any leads derived therefrom, should be
suppressed or are otherwise inadmissible. The decision whether conduct or statements of any
current director, officer or employee, or any person acting on behalf of, or at the direction of, the
Company, will be imputed to the Company for the purpose of determining whether the Company
has violated any provision of this Agreement shall be in the sole discretion of the Section.

19, The Company acknowledges that the Section has made no representations,
assurances, or promises concerning what sentence may be imposed by the Court if the Company
breaches this Agreement and this matter proceeds to judgment. The Company further
acknowledges that any such sentence is solely within the discretion of the Court and that nothing

in this Agreement binds or restricts the Court in the exercise of such discretion.
14
Case O:16-cr-60294-NC Document 2 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/24/2016 Page 15 of 58

20. Thirty days after the expiration of the period of deferred prosecution specified in
this Agreement, the Company, by the Chief Executive Officer of the Company and the Chief
Financial Officer of the Company, will certify to the Section that the Company has met its
disclosure obligations pursuant to Paragraph 6 of this Agreement. Each certification will be
deemed a material statement and representation by the Company to the executive branch of the
United States for purposes of 18 U.S.C. Â§ 1001, and it will be deemed to have been made in the
judicial district in which this Agreement is filed.

Sale, Merger, or Other Change in Corporate Form of Company

21. Except as may otherwise be agreed by the parties in connection with a particular
transaction, the Company agrees that in the event that, during the Term, it undertakes any change
in corporate form, including if it sells, merges, or transfers business operations that are material
to the Companyâs consolidated operations, or to the operations of any subsidiaries or affiliates
involved in the conduct described in the attached Statement of Facts, as they exist as of the date
of this Agreement, whether such sale is structured as a sale, asset sale, merger, transfer, or other
change in corporate form, it shall include in any contract for sale, merger, transfer, or other
change in corporate form a provision binding the purchaser, or any successor in interest thereto,
to the obligations described in this Agreement. The Company shall obtain approval from the
Section at least thirty days prior to undertaking any such sale, merger, transfer, or other change
in corporate form, including dissolution, in order to give the Section an opportunity to determine
if such change in corporate form would impact the terms or obligations of the Agreement.

Public Statements by Company
22, The Company expressly agrees that it shall not, through present or future

attorneys, officers, directors, employees, agents or any other person authorized to speak for the
15
Case O:16-cr-60294-NC Document 2 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/24/2016 Page 16 of 59

Company make any public statement, in litigation or otherwise, contradicting the acceptance of
responsibility by the Company set forth in Paragraph 2 above or the facts described in the
attached Statement of Facts. Any such contradictory statement shall, subject to cure rights of the
Company described below, constitute a breach of this Agreement, and the Company thereafter
shall be subject to prosecution as set forth in Paragraphs 16-19 of this Agreement. The decision
whether any public statement by any such person contradicting a fact contained in the Statement
of Facts will be imputed to the Company for the purpose of determining whether it has breached
this Agreement shall be at the sole discretion of the Section. If the Section determines that a
public statement by any such person contradicts in whole or in part a statement contained in the
attached Statement of Facts, the Section shall so notify the Company, and the Company may
avoid a breach of this Agreement by publicly repudiating such statement(s) within five business
days after notification. The Company shall be permitted to raise defenses and to assert
affirmative claims in other proceedings relating to the matters set forth in the attached Statement
of Facts provided that such defenses and claims do not contradict, in whole or in part, a
statement contained in the attached Statement of Facts. This Paragraph does not apply to any
statement made by any present or former officer, director, employee, or agent of the Company in
the course of any criminal, regulatory, or civil case initiated against such individual, unless such
individual is speaking on behalf of the Company.

23. The Company agrees that if it or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries or
affiliates issues a press release or holds any press conference in connection with this Agreement,
the Company shall first consult with the Section to determine (a) whether the text of the release

or proposed statements at the press conference are true and accurate with respect to matters

16
 

Case O:16-cr-60204-1C Document? Ertereconm FLSD Docket 10/24/2016 Page LY of 59

between the Section and the Company; and (b) whether the Section has any objection to the
release.

24, The Section agrees, if requested to do so, to bring to the attention of law
enforcement and regulatory authorities the facts and circumstances relating to the nature of the
conduct underlying this Agreement, including the nature and quality of the Companyâs
cooperation and remediation. By agreeing to provide this information to such authorities, the
Section is not agreeing to advocate on behalf of the Company, but rather is agreeing to provide
facts to be evaluated independently by such authorities.

Limitations on Binding Effect of Agreement

25. This Agreement is binding on the Company and the Section but specifically does
not bind any other component of the Department of Justice, other federal agencies, or any state,
local, or foreign law enforcement or regulatory agencies, or any other authorities, although the
Section will bring the cooperation of the Company and its compliance with its other obligations
under this Agreement to the attention of such agencies and authorities if requested to do so by
the Company.

2. Embraer Representations LLC (âEmbraer RLâ) was a subsidiary wholly owned
by EMBRAER, and incorporated in Delaware. Embraer RLâs financial statements were

The Unlawful Schemes
The Dominican Republic

14. From in or around August 2008 through at least in or around October 2010,
EMBRAER, through its employees and agents, agreed to pay and did pay Dominican Official
approximately $3.52 million to obtain a defense contract valued at approximately $96.4 million.

15. Beginning in or around June 2007, EMBRAER began efforts to sell the Super
Tucano aircraft, a turbine-driven military aircraft typically used for missions to fight drug
trafficking, counter insurgence missions, and training, to the FAD. There was no public bid or
tender for this sale. Rather, EMBRAER developed and negotiated the sale directly with
representatives of the FAD, and Dominican Official was EMBRAERâs primary point of contact
at the FAD.

16. By mid-2008, many of the terms of the sale had been negotiated but the
Dominican Republic Senate (âDominican Senateâ) had not yet approved the dealâs financing or

the purchase agreement, which were necessary steps for the completion of the sale). EMBRAER

A-4
Case O16-cr-60294-NC Document 2 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/24/2016 Page 26 of 59

employees and Dominican Official began discussing how they could influence the Dominican
Senate to provide the necessary approvals.

17. On or about August 25, 2008, an EMBRAER executive informed Embraer
Executive A by email that Dominican Official would be talking to a Dominican Senator about
compensation for the Senator but that Dominican Official wanted to talk to Embraer Executive A
before having that conversation. Embraer Executive A informed the other EMBRAER executive
that Embraer Executive A and Dominican Official had already spoken.

18. | Onor about September 1, 2008, Embraer Executive A agreed to pay Dominican
Official 3.7% of the value of the contract (which ultimately came to approximately $3.52
million) if the sale was completed. That same day, Embraer Executive A emailed another
EMBRAER executive that the Dominican Senateâs meeting to approve financing of the
transaction would soon take place and that âthey want to have the agent agreement doc signed
before the meeting.â

19. In or around early September 2008, Dominican Official and Embraer Executive A
agreed that the payment referred to in Paragraph 18 would be paid to three separate Dominican
shell entities: one would receive $2.5 million, a second would receive $920,000, and a third
would receive $100,000.

20. âIn or around August 2008, Dominican Official promoted the Super Tucano
contract before the Dominican Senate Finance Committee and presented the terms of the deal to
the Dominican Senate. The following month, on or about September 16, 2008, the Dominican
Senate approved the financing for the deal.

21. On or about December 24, 2008, the Dominican Senate approved the sale and

financing contracts for the eight Super Tucano airplanes, agreeing to purchase the aircraft for

A-5
Case O:16-cr-60294-NC Document 2 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/24/2016 Page 2? of 53

approximately $96.4 million. Shortly before it did so, the Secretary of the FAD issued a letter to
EMBRAER authorizing Dominican Official to sign, on behalf of the Dominican Republic,
invoices and certificates called for by the sales contract.

22. Onor about January 9, 2009, EMBRAER publicly announced its sale of eight
Super Tucano aircraft to the Dominican Republic.

23. Beginning at least when EMBRAER publicly announced the sale, Dominican
Official repeatedly contacted EMBRAER requesting the payments that had been promised. For
example, on or about March 16, 2009, Dominican Official emailed an EMBRAER employee
demanding that EMBRAER begin making the agreed-upon payments, noting that âinterested and
compromised partiesâ were exerting pressure.

24, Based on these repeated requests, on or about April 24, 2009, Embraer RL wired
$100,000 to one of the shell companies referenced in Paragraph 19 from Embraer RLâs bank
account in New York to a bank account in the Dominican Republic.

25. Following the $100,000 payment referenced in Paragraph 24, Dominican Official
persisted with efforts to collect the promised payments, and an executive in EMBRAERâs legal
department provided senior EMBRAER managers with guidance on how to make those
payments in a manner that would conceal their true purpose.

26. For example, on or about September 30, 2009, an EMBRAER employee sent an
email to an EMBRAER executive detailing how an executive in EMBRAERâs legal department
had advised using a third-party agent, âAgent A,â who had previously provided agency services
to EMBRAER, to remit the remaining two payments to Dominican Official instead of directly

paying the shell companies that Dominican Official had identified.

A-6
Case O16-cr-60294-NC Document 2 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/24/2016 Page 28 of 59

27. On or about October 16, 2009, an EMBRAER executive emailed the same
executive in EMBRAERâs legal department asking for additional guidance on how to proceed,
adding that EMBRAER feared pressure at any moment from âfour stars,â which was a reference
to Dominican government officials.

28. | Onor about November 5, 2009, Embraer Executive A emailed Agent A to say
that Dominican Official would be Agent Aâs point of contact in the Dominican Republic, that
Dominican Official was an âFAD colonel but the classmate of 4 star generals,â that Dominican
Official had provided a âsafeâ phone number to use, and that Dominican Official had been
designated as the intermediary between EMBRAER and the groups âinvolved on the other side.â

29, On or about November 16, 2009, Dominican Official emailed Embraer Executive
A to confirm that Dominican Official had spoken with Agent A, and expressed satisfaction over
Agent Aâs cooperation, but warned that at least one of the outstanding payments needed to be
made by the end of the month.

30. Onor about March 12, 2010, Embraer RL and Agent Aâs company entered into a
purported agency agreement, pursuant to which Embraer RL would pay Agent Aâs company an
8% commission on any successful sales of aircraft to the Jordanian Air Force. The agreement
called for Embraer RL to make advance payments to Agent Aâs company of $2.5 million and
$920,000, which, when totaled, equaled the $3,420,000 that EMBRAER had promised to
Dominican Official.

31, On or about April 6, 2010, Agent Aâs company submitted to Embraer RL two |
invoices for âsales promotion servicesâ in the amounts of $2.5 million and $920,000. An
internal EMBRAER memorandum indicated that the payments were related to the commission

owed for the Super Tucano aircrafts sold to the government of the Dominican Republic, not

A-7
Case O:16-cr-60294-NC Document 2 Entered om FLSD Docket 10/24/2018 Page 29 of 59

potential sales to the Jordanian Air Force. Indeed, EMBRAER never sold any aircraft to the
Jordanian Air Force, Agent A rendered no services in connection with any attempted sale to the
Jordanian Air Force, and Agent A rendered no legitimate services to EMBRAER related to the
sale of Super Tucanos to the FAD.

32, On or about May 24 and June 25, 2010, Embraer RL wired $2.5 million and
$920,000, respectively, from its New York bank account to Agent Aâs companyâs bank account
in Uruguay.

33. On or about October 21, 2010, Dominican Official sent an email to Agent A from
an email account in the United States that contained wiring instructions for a Panamanian bank
account. Agent A transferred more than $3 million to Dominican Official, including more than
â¬1 million to the Panamanian bank account identified in the October 21, 2010, email.

34. | The payments to Agent Aâs company were falsely booked as sales commissions
in Embraer RLâs internal accounting records and as selling expenses in EMBRAERâs
consolidated 2010 financial statement. The April 24, 2009, payment of $100,000 to one of the
Dominican shell companies was likewise falsely booked as a selling expense in EMBRAERâs
consolidated 2010 statement.

Saudi Arabia

35. From in or around November 2009 through February 2011, EMBRAER agreed to
pay and did pay Saudi Arabia Official more than $1.5 million to obtain a contract for the sale of
three business jets, valued at approximately $93 million, to Saudi Arabia Instrumentality.

36. In or around 2007, EMBRAER learned that Saudi Arabia Instrumentality was
interested in purchasing executive jets. By 2009, Saudi Arabia Instrumentality had narrowed its
interest to purchasing aircraft from EMBRAER and one other manufacturer.

A-8
 

Case O:16-cr-60204-1C Document? Erterecionm FLSD Docket 10/24/2016 Page 80 of 59

37.  Inor around early December 2009, Embraer Executive B met with Saudi Arabia
Official in London. Saudi Arabia Official offered to help EMBRAER win the aircraft contract
and to change the terms of the deal from the sale of used jets to new jets, which would be a more
lucrative transaction for EMBRAER, if EMBRAER compensated Saudi Arabia Official.
Embraer Executive B knew that Saudi Arabia Official was a high-level official at Saudi Arabia
Instrumentality and believed that Saudi Arabia Official could deliver on the promise.

38. Saudi Arabia Official and Embraer Executive B negotiated the amount of Saudi
Arabia Officialâs payment. Saudi Arabia Official rejected an initial offer of $200,000 per
aircraft. Embraer Executive B sent an email to Embraer Executive Bâs supervisor and another
EMBRAER executive on or about December 10, 2009, indicating that Saudi Arabia Official had
justified the request for a higher payment on the grounds that â[h]e has budget for used only and
will have to lobby for more funds to take new [aircraft] over used.â Embraer Executive B added,
âIt]here is more to come to replace the entire fleet they have with 170,s [sic] [Saudi Arabia
Official] sees this as long term.â Embraer Executive Bâs supervisor approved offering a per-
aircraft payment of $550,000.

39. On or about December 28, 2009, Embraer Executive B and Saudi Arabia Official
agreed on a per-aircraft payment of $550,000, for a total amount of $1.65 million. Two days
later, on or about December 30, 2009, Embraer Executive B told another EMBRAER executive
that Saudi Arabia Instrumentality had opted to purchase three new jets.

40. Embraer Executive B devised a plan to conceal the payments to Saudi Arabia
Official by funneling them through Agent B, which had no experience in the aircraft industry or

in Saudi Arabia.
 

Case O:16-cr-60294-NC Document 2 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/24/2016 Page 31 of 58

4l. On or about January 5, 2010, Embraer Executive B sent an email about the
transaction with Saudi Arabia Instrumentality to a number of EMBRAER employees
summarizing âwhere we are based on our latest talks today[] with [] senior mngt [for Saudi
Arabia Instrumentality] and the party driving this deal through who[m] we are working with on
an [agency] basis.â Embraer Executive B reported in the email about a meeting between âthe
head of [Saudi Arabia Instrumentalityâs] Aviation Dept (who is helping us with this deal),â and
the committee that allocated funds for the purchase, and stated that âour contact on the
transaction (head of the dept) has advised that we must hold our price during the negotiation on
the basis we have put forward our best offer for the basic aircraft and therefore[] cannot negotiate
further on this.â Embraer Executive B explained that it âha[d] been made extremely clear and
agreed with our contact[] that should any additional funds be required to cover any other
concession that exceeds our $120k limit, this would be from the [agency commission] amount in
reserve.â

42. | Onor about February 26, 2010, pursuant to Embraer Executive Bâs request,
EMBRAER executives, including one in EMBRAERâs legal department, approved the agency
arrangement with Agent B, pursuant to which Agent B would purportedly serve as EMBRAERâs
sales agent for the deal with Saudi Arabia Instrumentality.

43. Onor about March 5, 2010, Embraer RL executed an agency contract with Agent
B signed by EMBRAER executives, pursuant to which Agent B was to âpromote sales of ...
aircraft manufactured by Embraer ... solely and specifically toâ a subsidiary of Saudi Arabia
Instrumentality.

44. Less than two weeks later, on or about March 15, 2010, EMBRAER and a U.S.-
based subsidiary of Saudi Arabia Instrumentality entered into an aircraft purchase agreement,

A-10
 

Case O:16-cr-60294-NC Document 2 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/24/2016 Page 32 of 59

pursuant to which the subsidiary agreed to purchase three new aircraft for approximately $93
million. The aircraft were delivered in or around November and December of 2010.

45. In or around December 2010, Agent B submitted three invoices, each in the
amount of $550,000, for its purported commission, even though Agent B had not rendered any
services to EMBRAER in connection with the sale. Executives at EMBRAER approved paying
the invoices. The payments were made through two wire transfers from Embraer RLâs bank
account in New York to Agent Bâs bank account in South Africa: $550,000 on or about
December 22, 2010, and $1.1 million on or about February 18, 2011. Embraer RL booked the
payments as âsales commissionsâ and the payments were consolidated into the parentâs financial
statements.

46. Agent B subsequently transferred more than $1.4 million of the $1.65 million it
received from Embraer RL to bank accounts held by Saudi Arabia Officialâs longtime
acquaintance, who in turn kept a portion of the monies and transferred the remainder to Saudi
Arabia Official.

Mozambique

47. From in or around May 2008 through at least September 2008, EMBRAER
negotiated the sale of two commercial aircraft to LAM.

48. | EMBRAER submitted a formal proposal to LAM on or about May 21, 2008, for
the sale of two commercial aircraft for approximately $32 million each, with an option for LAM
to buy two more aircraft at the same price. The proposal followed nearly three years of work by
Embraer Executive D to convince LAM to purchase from EMBRAER rather than competitors.

49. In mid-August 2008, during negotiations between EMBRAER and LAM, Agent
C, who had not previously worked or had any contact with EMBRAER, contacted Embraer

A-1I1
 

Case O16-cr-60294-NC Document 2 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/24/2016 Page 33 of 59

Executive D and said that Agent C would be serving as a consultant on the deal referenced in
Paragraph 48.

50. Rather than reject Agent Câs solicitation, on or about August I1, 2008, Embraer
Executive D sent an email to two EMBRAER executives and proposed that they âcreate some
margins for the commissionsâ for Agent C in the pricing of the two optional aircraft LAM could
buy after purchasing the first two.

51. On or about August 13, 2008, Embraer Executive C sent an email to several
EMBRAER executives recounting a conversation with Agent C, in which Agent C told Embraer
Executive C that, even though EMBRAER had not been prepared to have a consultant, âwe'd
like to have a âgestureâ when delivering the first plane.â Embraer Executive C proposed in the
email that âwe have to show some gesture and maybe the value mentioned by [another
EMBRAER executive] (50K to 80K) would fit the actual need... .â Embraer Executive C had
advised Agent C how to set up a company to which EMBRAER could make purported
consultancy payments, telling Agent C that in order to receive a payment from EMBRAER,
Agent C âneeds to have a company, names, address and not be established in a tax-heaven [sic]
country ....â

52. In response, an EMBRAER executive who had received the email referenced in
Paragraph 51, agreed that they could offer to pay Agent C $50,000 for each of the first two
planes sold, and go up to $80,000 per plane if necessary, while also agreeing to a payment of
somewhere between 2 and 2.5% of the purchase price of the two optional planes, should LAM
purchase them.

53. Onor about August 18, 2008, Embraer Executive C conveyed the $50,000 offer
to Agent C. Embraer Executive C reported afterward in an email to other EMBRAER executives

A-12
 

Case O16-cr-60294-NC Document 2 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/24/2016 Page 34 of 59

that it appeared that Agent C was âexpecting [a] much higher fee,â and, indeed, after hearing the
amount, Agent C intimated that LAM may award the contract to a competitor instead.

54. On or about August 25, 2008, Mozambique Official called Embraer Executive D.
In an email the same day to other EMBRAER executives, Embraer Executive D recounted the
conversation, noting that Mozambique Official had âhighlighted that [Mozambique Official] had
received very nasty comments from some individuals, in relation to Embraerâs commission
proposal to [Agent C].â Mozambique Official further âindicated that some individuals felt that
Embraerâs proposal was an insult, and in a sense, it would have been less insulting to give
nothing, even if this was not an acceptable solution.â Embraer Executive D asked Mozambique
Official âwhat would [Agent C] expect from Embraer.â Mozambique Official responded that,
âin the current circumstances, [Mozambique Official] thought about one million USD.â After
some pushback from Embraer Executive D, Mozambique Official âfinally suggested that we
might get away with 800,000 USD (2 x400,000).â When Embraer Executive D told
Mozambique Official that EMBRAER âhad no budget for such consultancy fee,â Mozambique
Official suggested taking it from the profit margin on the two optional aircraft and also âasked if
[EMBRAER] could increase the aircraft price... .â

55. On or about September 15, 2008, EMBRAER and LAM executed the purchase
agreement for the sale of two E190 aircraft at approximately $32,690,000 each with a $312,000
down payment for a third aircraft. Mozambique Official was one of three LAM executives that
signed the purchase agreement on behalf of LAM.

56. On or about April 22, 2009, seven months after the execution of the purchase
agreement but before delivery of the first aircraft, Embraer RL entered into an agency agreement
with a company Agent C had recently formed in the Democratic Republic of S40 TomÃ© and

A-13
Case O:16-cr-60294-NC Document 2 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/24/2016 Page 35 of 58

Principe. Two EMBRAER executives signed the agency agreement on EMBRAERâs behalf.
The agency agreement authorized Agent Câs company to promote sales of the E190 âsolely and
specificallyâ to LAM, even though the sale of such aircraft had already been completed seven
months prior to the execution of the agreement, Agent Câs company did not exist at the time the
purchase agreement was signed, and Agent Câs company did not perform any legitimate work in
connection with the purchase agreement. The agreement with Agent Câs company falsely stated
that the sales promotion efforts identified therein had begun in or around March 2008.

57. Pursuant to the agency agreement described in Paragraph 56, Embraer RL agreed
to pay Agent Câs company $400,000 per aircraft (the exact amount Mozambique Official had
previously said EMBRAER could âget awayâ with paying). However, neither Agent C nor
Agent Câs company ever provided any legitimate services to EMBRAER.

58. EMBRAER delivered the two aircraft to LAM on or about July 30, 2009, and
September 2, 2009. Following the delivery of each aircraft, Agent Câs company submitted two
invoices to EMBRAER for $400,000 each, one dated August 15, 2009, and one dated September
24, 2009. An EMBRAER executive signed and approved both invoices for payment. On or
about August 31, 2009, Embraer RL wired $400,000, from its U.S.-based bank account to an
account at a bank in So TomÃ© and Principe, for further credit to the an account at a bank in
Portugal, which was held by Agent Câs company. On or about October 2, 2009, Embraer RL
wired an additional $400,000 from its U.S.-based bank account to Agent Câs companyâs
Portugal-based bank account. Embraer RL recorded these payments as âSales Commissionâ and
they were consolidated into EMBRAERâs books under âNet Operating (expenses) incomeâ as a

âSellingâ expense, specifically, âSales Commission.â

India

59. On or about July 3, 2008, EMBRAER executed a contract to provide three highly
specialized military aircraft to the Indian Air Force for approximately $208 million. In
connection with the deal, EMBRAER retained the services of Agent D pursuant to a 2005
agency agreement. It later paid $5.76 million to Agent D pursuant to a false agency agreement
signed in or around 2008.

60. Inor around January 2005, EMBRAER executed an agency agreement with a
shell company domiciled in the United Kingdom and affiliated with Agent D (although Agent
Dâs name never appeared in the agreement). Under the agency agreement, EMBRAER agreed to
pay the shell company a commission of 9% of the value of any defense contracts EMBRAER
obtained in India because EMBRAER believed Agent D could help ensure that any contract
would be awarded on a single-source, rather than competitive, basis. EMBRAER personnel
thought the agreement with Agent D was illegal under Indian law and thus took steps to conceal
its existence, including secreting the sole fully-executed version of the agreement in a safe
deposit box in London that could be opened only when both an EMBRAER employee and Agent
D or an associate of Agent D were present.

61. Less than a month after executing the agency agreement with the shell company,
on or about February 8, 2005, EMBRAER announced that it had signed a memorandum of
understanding (âMOUâ) with Indiaâs Defence Research and Development Organisation to
support the development of a new early warning radar system for the Indian Air Force, which
EMBRAER believed could ultimately result in EMBRAER securing a contract for the sale of

three Embraer 145 aircraft.

A-15
 

Case O:16-cr-60294-NC Document 2 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/24/2016 Page 37 of 53

62. On or about July 3, 2008, nearly three years after signing the MOU, the Indian Air
Force agreed to purchase three aircraft from EMBRAER for approximately $208 million (the
âIndia contractâ). The next day, on or about July 4, 2008, Agent D contacted EMBRAER
employees and demanded payment of the commission pursuant to the contract referenced in
Paragraph 60.

63. | Agent D continued making demands for payment and, in or around F ebruary and
March 2009, an EMBRAER executive met with lawyers representing Agent D to discuss Agent
D's payment demands. Following these discussions, EMBRAER executives agreed to pay $5.76
million to Agent D to settle the claim.

64. To conceal the payment referenced in Paragraph 63, EMBRAER created a false
agency agreement. On or about November 21, 2009, more than a year after EMBRAER was
awarded the India contract, EMBRAER, through its wholly owned subsidiary, ECC Investment
Switzerland AG (âECCâ), executed an agency agreement with a shell company domiciled in
Singapore and affiliated with Agent D for its purported services as an agent in a sale EMBRAER
had made to an unrelated customer in another country that had purchased an EMBRAER aircraft
more than a year earlier, in or around July 2008. The Singaporean shell company never
performed any services related to that sale or to the sale to the Indian Air Force.

65. The same day that the agency agreement was executed, the Singaporean shell
company delivered three invoices to ECC, each for $1.92 million. EMBRAER, through ECC,
remitted three payments to the shell company shortly thereafter. EMBRAERâs books and

records did not reflect that this transaction was related to its arrangement with Agent D.
 

Case O:16-cr-60204-1C Document? Ertereconm FLSD Docket 10/24/2016 Page 388 of 59

Profits

66. From the unlawful conduct described above, Embraerâs total profits were
$83,816,476.

EMBRAERâs Internal Accounting Controls

67, During the relevant period, EMBRAER knowingly and willfully failed to devise
and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. In particular, and as relevant
here, EMBRAER had no internal accounting controls that, among other things, (a) required
adequate due diligence for the retention of third-party consultants and agent; (b) required a fully
executed contract with a third-party before payment could be made to it; (c) required
documentation or other proof that services had been rendered by a third-party before payment
could be made to it; or (d) implemented oversight of the payment process to ensure that
payments were made pursuant to appropriate controls, including those described above.

68. For example, in connection with the Dominican Republic bribery scheme,
EMBRAER made payments to one of the shell companies identified by Dominican Official,
even though a foreign official had told EMBRAER to which company to make agency payments,
and EMBRAER had conducted no diligence on the shell company, did not have a signed contract
with the shell company, and knew that the shell company had not performed any legitimate
services in exchange for the payment.

69. Also in connection with the Dominican Republic bribery scheme, EMBRAER
made payments to Agent A for services purportedly rendered in connection with an aircraft sale
to the Jordanian Air Force, even though EMBRAER never sold any aircraft to the Jordanian Air
Force, and EMBRAER knew that Agent A had rendered no services in connection with any

attempted sale to the Jordanian Air Force, and even though an internal EMBRAER memorandum

A-17
Case O:16-cr-60294-NC Document 2 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/24/2016 Page 39 of 59

indicated that the payments were related to the commission owed for the Super Tucano aircrafts
sold to the government of the Dominican Republic, not potential sales to the Jordanian Air Force

70. Further, in connection with the Saudi Arabia bribery scheme, EMBRAER made
payments to Agent B, even though it had conducted minimal due diligence on Agent B, did so
almost exclusively on the basis of information Embraer Executive B personally provided to its
contracts and legal departments, and did not require any proof of services from Agent B before
making payment.

71, Similarly, in connection with the Mozambique scheme, the only due diligence
that EMBRAER conducted on Agent Câs company was limited to collecting the companyâs
registration documents, corporate by-laws, and board minutes directly from Agent C, and
EMBRAER did not require any proof of services from Agent C before making payment.

72. | Numerous high-level EMBRAER executives knew that the various agency
agreements referenced above falsely represented that payments were being made for legitimate
agency services, and that the true purpose of the payments made to the agents was to funnel
bribes to foreign officials. Many of the high-level executives who knew about the false nature of
the agreements and the improper purpose of the payments had the authority and responsibility to
ensure that EMBRAER devised and maintained an adequate system of internal accounting
controls, knew that EMBRAERâs then-existing internal accounting controls failed to prevent
EMBRAER from entering into false agency agreements and making improper payments, and
knowingly and willfully failed to implement adequate internal accounting controls to address the
known weaknesses, in part to permit EMBRAER to enter into false agency agreements and

funnel bribes to foreign officials.

ATTACHMENT D
INDEPENDENT COMPLIANCE MONITOR

The duties and authority of the Independent Compliance Monitor (the âMonitorâ), and
the obligations of Embraer S.A. (the âCompanyâ), on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries and
affiliates, with respect to the Monitor and the United States Department of Justice, Criminal
Division, Fraud Section (the âSectionâ), are as described below:

1. The Company will retain the Monitor for a period of three (3) years (the âTerm of
the Monitorshipâ), unless the early termination provision of Paragraph 3 of the Deferred
Prosecution Agreement (the âAgreementâ) is triggered.

Monitor âs Mandate

2. The Monitorâs primary responsibility is to assess and monitor the Companyâs
compliance with the terms of the Agreement, including the Corporate Compliance Program in
Attachment C, so as to specifically address and reduce the risk of any recurrence of the
Companyâs misconduct. During the Term of the Monitorship, the Monitor will evaluate, in the
manner set forth below, the effectiveness of the internal accounting controls, record-keeping, and
financial reporting policies and procedures of the Company as they relate to the Companyâs
current and ongoing compliance with the FCPA and other applicable anti-corruption laws
(collectively, the âanti-corruption lawsâ) and take such reasonable steps as, in his or her view,
may be necessary to fulfill the foregoing mandate (the âMandateâ). This Mandate shall include
an assessment of the Board of Directorsâ and senior managementâs commitment to, and effective
implementation of, the corporate compliance program described in Attachment C of the

Agreement.
 

Case O:16-cr-60294-NC Document 2 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/24/2016 Page 51 of 59

Companyâs Obligations

3. The Company shall cooperate fully with the Monitor, and the Monitor shall have
the authority to take such reasonable steps as, in his or her view, may be necessary to be fully
informed about the Companyâs compliance program in accordance with the principles set forth
herein and applicable law, including applicable data protection and labor laws and regulations.
To that end, the Company shall: facilitate the Monitorâs access to the Companyâs documents and
resources; not limit such access, except as provided in Paragraphs 5-6; and provide guidance on
applicable local law (such as relevant data protection and labor laws). The Company shall
provide the Monitor with access to all information, documents, records, facilities, and
employees, as reasonably requested by the Monitor, that fall within the scope of the Mandate of
the Monitor under the Agreement. The Company shall use its best efforts to provide the Monitor
with access to the Companyâs former employees and its third-party vendors, agents, and
consultants.

4. Any disclosure by the Company to the Monitor concerning corrupt payments,
false books and records, and internal accounting control failures shall not relieve the Company of
any otherwise applicable obligation to truthfully disclose such matters to the Section, pursuant to
the Agreement.

Withholding Access

5. The parties agree that no attorney-client relationship shall be formed between the
Company and the Monitor. In the event that the Company seeks to withhold from the Monitor
access to information, documents, records, facilities, or current or former employees of the
Company that may be subject to a claim of attorney-client privilege or to the attorney work-

product doctrine, or where the Company reasonably believes production would otherwise be

D-2
 

Case O:16-cr-60294-NC Document 2 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/24/2016 Page 52 of 59

inconsistent with applicable law, the Company shall work cooperatively with the Monitor to
resolve the matter to the satisfaction of the Monitor.

6. If the matter cannot be resolved, at the request of the Monitor, the Company shall
promptly provide written notice to the Monitor and the Section. Such notice shall include a
general description of the nature of the information, documents, records, facilities or current or
former employees that are being withheld, as well as the legal basis for withholding access. The
Section may then consider whether to make a further request for access to such information,
documents, records, facilities, or employees.

Monitorâs Coordination with the
Company and Review Methodology

7. In carrying out the Mandate, to the extent appropriate under the circumstances,
the Monitor should coordinate with Company personnel, including in-house counsel, compliance
personnel, and internal auditors, on an ongoing basis. The Monitor may rely on the product of
the Companyâs processes, such as the results of studies, reviews, sampling and testing
methodologies, audits, and analyses conducted by or on behalf of the Company, as well as the
Companyâs internal resources (e.g., legal, compliance, and internal audit), which can assist the
Monitor in carrying out the Mandate through increased efficiency and Company-specific
expertise, provided that the Monitor has confidence in the quality of those resources.

8. The Monitorâs reviews should use a risk-based approach, and thus, the Monitor is
not expected to conduct a comprehensive review of all business lines, all business activities, or
all markets. In carrying out the Mandate, the Monitor should consider, for instance, risks
presented by: (a) the countries and industries in which the Company operates; (b) current and

future business opportunities and transactions; (c) current and potential business partners,

D-8
 

Case O:16-cr-60294-NC Document 2 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/24/2016 Page 58 of 59

Company or any entity or person working, directly or indirectly, for or on
behalf of the Company; or

e the Company may have maintained false books, records or accounts; or
(collectively, âPotential Misconductâ), the Monitor shall immediately report the Potential
Misconduct to the Companyâs General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer, and/or Audit
Committee for further action, unless the Potential Misconduct was already so disclosed. The

Potential Misconduct to the Section when it requests the information.

may constitute a criminal or regulatory violation (âActual Misconductâ), the Monitor shall
immediately report the Actual Misconduct to the Section. When the Monitor discovers Actual
Misconduct, the Monitor shall disclose the Actual Misconduct solely to the Section, and, in such

appropriate under the circumstances.

previously disclosed to the Section or not. Further, if the Company or any entity or person
working directly or indirectly for or on behalf of the Company withholds information necessary
for the performance of the Monitorâs responsibilities and the Monitor believes that such
withholding is without just cause, the Monitor shall also immediately disclose that fact to the
Section and address the Companyâs failure to disclose the necessary information in his or her

reports.

writing, or except to the extent that the Section determines in its sole discretion that disclosure
would be in furtherance of the Sectionâs discharge of its duties and responsibilities or is

otherwise required by law.
