THE GRAND JURY CHARGES:

At all times relevant to this Indictment, unless otherwise stated: GOLD, Me.
1. Summary

1. The defendant MICHAEL LESLIE COHEN was a United States citizen
who resided in London, England. COHEN was the head of the European office of publicly
traded hedge fund Och-Ziff Capital Management Group LLC (âOch-Ziffâ), and was responsible
for overseeing Och-Ziffâs investments in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. COHEN was also
an Executive Managing Director and a member of the partnership management committee of
Och-Ziff. COHEN was an âinvestment adviserâ and a âperson associated with an investment
adviser,â as those terms are used in Title 15, United States Code, Section 80b-2(a)(1 1) and
(a)(17), respectively, and therefore owed his clients a fiduciary duty. In connection with his
employment at Och-Ziff, COHEN was also responsible for avoiding both actual and apparent
conflicts of interests between his personal interests and the interests of Och-Ziff and its
subsidiary and affiliated entities, and for disclosing any potential conflicts of interest to Och-Ziff

legal personnel.
2. The âCharitable Foundation,â an entity the identity of which is known to
the Grand Jury, was a United Kingdom based charitable organization and investor. The
defendant MICHAEL LESLIE COHEN and Och-Ziff and its affiliate entities including âOZ
Management LPâ provided investment advice and management services to the Charitable
Foundation.

3. Beginning in or about November 2010, as part of obtaining the Charitable
Foundationâs consent to purchase stock shares in a company called Strata Limited (âStrataâ), the
defendant MICHAEL LESLIE COHEN, along with others, made material misrepresentations
and omissions to the Charitable Foundation concerning conflicts of interest and self-dealing that
existed with the transaction, including: (a) failing to disclose that one of the proposed sellers of
Strata shares, Co-Conspirator #1 (ââCC-1ââ), an individual whose identity is known to the Grand
Jury, owed COHEN $18 million and was planning to use proceeds from the sale of the Strata
shares to repay COHEN $4 million; (b) concealing the identity of another proposed seller of
Strata shares, Co-Conspirator #2 (ââCC-2â), an individual whose identity is known to the Grand
Jury, because CC-2, like COHEN, was a ârelated partyâ and thus had a conflict of interest in the
transaction; and (c) failing to disclose that COHEN had recently sold back to a third proposed
seller of Strata shares, âJohn Doe,â an individual whose identity is known to the Grand Jury,
certain Strata shares while understanding that those same shares would be re-sold as part of the
transaction.

4, In or about March 2012, the defendant MICHAEL LESLIE COHEN
learned that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (âSECâ), an agency of the United
States, had served a subpoena on Och-Ziff requiring the production of materials related to,

among other subject matters, CC-1. To continue hiding the scheme and self-dealing, and to
explain the fact that CC-1 had repaid him $4 million on a personal loan immediately after
receiving the proceeds of the Strata stock sale, COHEN caused CC-1 to create a fake letter,
backdated to before the sale, which falsely represented that CC-1 would not use any proceeds
from the sale to repay his personal loan to COHEN (the âBackdated Letterâ). In or about May
2013, COHEN made materially false statements about the Backdated Letter to law enforcement
agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (âFBIâ) and the Internal Revenue Service (âIRSâ)
and an attorney for the SEC, including that COHEN did not know that the letter was backdated
and that he had received the letter prior to the Strata stock transaction.
IL. Investment Adviser and Wire Fraud Schemes

A. Och-Ziffâs Status as a Registered Investment Adviser

5. Och-Ziff had its headquarters in New York, New York, and its shares

were listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Och-Ziff provided asset management services
for individual hedge funds and alternative investment vehicles (the âOch-Ziff Hedge Fundsâ) in
return for management fees and incentive income. Investments by outside investors (also called
limited partners) into the Och-Ziff Hedge Funds were approved by Och-Ziff personnel in New
York; significant private investments made by the Och-Ziff Hedge Funds were vetted and
approved by personnel in New York; and all expenses incurred by any entity within Och-Ziff
had to be approved by personnel in New York prior to being paid. All Och-Ziff external e-mails
sent or received were routed through the Eastern District of New York, including those sent or
received by employees based in Och-Ziffâs London, England office. Internal e-mails between
Och-Ziff employees based in London and New York were also routed through the Eastern

District of New York.
6. OZ Management LP, a subsidiary of Och-Ziff, was a registered investment
adviser. As a registered investment adviser, OZ Management LP was required to file a form to
register itself as an investment adviser (ââForm-ADVâ), and amendments to the Form-ADV, with
the SEC. On or about and between March 30, 2007 and March 31, 2011, the defendant
MICHAEL LESLIE COHEN was listed in multiple Forms-ADV filed by OZ Management LP
with the SEC under the schedule of owners and executive officers of OZ Management LP.

B. COHEN Solicited the Charitable Foundation to Invest in a Joint Venture
Focused on Africa

7. In or about January 2008, Och-Ziff publicly announced that it had created
a joint venture company called Africa Management Limited (âAMLâ) with two South African
business partners for the purpose of investing in African mining, oil and mineral concessions.
Beginning on or about March 31, 2008, OZ Management LP listed AML as an affiliated
investment adviser on its Form-ADV filed with the SEC. Internal AML documents demonstrate
that the defendant MICHAEL LESLIE COHEN was a director of AML between at least on or
about October 29, 2008 and July 2, 2012.

8. AML established two investment funds that it managed and advised; the
first fund was named African Global Capital, LP (âAGC Iâ) and the second fund was named
African Global Capital II, LP (âAGC IIâ). AGC II was open to investments by outside
investors, such as the Charitable Foundation. OZ Management LP recognized investments
made into AGC II as part of OZ Management LPâs assets under management, and AGC I and
AGC II were part of Och-Ziffâs strategy to grow its assets under management after its initial
public offering. Och-Ziffâs approval was required for all investments by AGC I and AGC II,
both of which relied upon Och-Ziffâs legal and compliance functions to perform due diligence,
provide legal advice and document transactions. AML also relied upon the expertise of Och-

4
Ziff personnel to evaluate the commercial terms of proposed transactions and to manage AGC I
and AGC II investments.

9. The defendant MICHAEL LESLIE COHEN also directly marketed
AGC II to other prospective investors through meetings and presentations, including in the
United States. In or about and between May 2008 and October 2008, Och-Ziff, COHEN and
others solicited the Charitable Foundation to make a large investment in AGC II. In connection
with soliciting the Charitable Foundation, on or about June 17, 2008, Och-Ziffâs investor
relations department in New York sent marketing materials for AGC II by e-mail to the
Charitable Foundation. The marketing materials referenced OZ Management LPâs status as an
SEC-registered investment adviser, touted Och-Ziffâs âglobal investment management expertiseâ
and highlighted the participation of key Och-Ziff personnel in AGC II, including COHEN and
senior Och-Ziff employees based in New York. In addition, Och-Ziff also provided the
Charitable Foundation with a portion of the Form-ADV, which the SEC required investment
advisers to provide to clients and potential clients during solicitations.

10. Prior to the Charitable Foundationâs investment in AGC II, the defendant
MICHAEL LESLIE COHEN represented to the Charitable Foundation, in sum and substance
and in part, that: (a) Och-Ziffâs status as an SEC-registered company meant that AGC II would
comply with the requirements of U.S. law, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; and (b)
Och-Ziff personnel would be responsible for ensuring AGC IIâs compliance with relevant laws
and providing protection against the corruption risks inherent in mining and mineral transactions
in Africa. In its interactions with COHEN and Och-Ziff during the solicitation process, the
Charitable Foundation indicated that Och-Ziffâs control of AGC II was important to the

Charitable Foundationâs consideration of a potential investment in AGC II. Also in connection
with the solicitation of its investment in AGC II, the Charitable Trust agreed to âunconditionally
waive any objection to the laying of venue and consent to submit to the non-exclusive
jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York and of the United States of America located in
the city of New York for any actions, suits or proceedings arising out of or relating to [the
confidentiality agreement] and the transactions contemplated hereby[.]â

11. Onor about October 1, 2008, the Charitable Foundation agreed to invest
in AGC II as a limited partner. The Charitable Foundation committed to invest up to $200
million in capital into AGC II, which would be used to fund future investments by AGC II. The
Charitable Foundation made arrangements with Och-Ziff to allow the Charitable Foundation to
reallocate its holdings with other Och-Ziff managed investments in order to fund capital calls for
AGC II. That same day, certain Och-Ziff partners, including multiple U.S. citizens, also
committed to invest up to $200 million in AGC II through a limited partner company (the âOZ
Partner Companyâ).

12. Pursuant to the agreements executed by the Charitable Foundation to
invest in AGC II, related party transactions required the consent of an advisory committee
(âAdvisory Committeeâ), which consisted solely of a representative from the Charitable
Foundation. Under its agreements with the Charitable Foundation, the managing partner of
AGC II was required to inform the Charitable Foundation of any conflicts of interest that arose
from proposed transactions and to obtain an executed Advisory Committee consent form waiving
those conflicts. Many of the functions of the managing partner were carried out by employees
of Och-Ziff, including, among others, the defendant MICHAEL LESLIE COHEN. The
Charitable Foundation relied on information, including investment memoranda, prepared and

sent by Och-Ziff and its employees, including COHEN.
C. COHENâs Interest in CC-1âs Shares of Strata Stock

13. In or about December 2008, the defendant MICHAEL LESLIE COHEN
loaned $18 million to CC-1 to allow CC-1 to make a financing payment on a personal luxury
yacht. The loan was eventually secured, in part, by CC-1âs interest in Strata shares.
Specifically, CC-1 gave COHEN the right to control certain shares of Strata that CC-1 owned.

14. In or about November 2010, CC-1 was delinquent on repaying the
defendant MICHAEL LESLIE COHEN the $18 million personal loan related to the yacht.
CC-1 and COHEN therefore agreed that CC-1 would make a $4 million payment to COHEN on
or before December 31, 2010. To make that payment, CC-1 would sell his/her Strata shares to
AGC II and provide $4 million of the sale proceeds to COHEN.

D. COHENâs Concealment of CC-2âs Identity as a Proposed Seller
of Shares of Strata

15. CC-2 was a South African national who exercised a management role in
AGC II through an entity CC-2 controlled. CC-2 also owned shares of Strata as of in or about
October 2010, and sought to sell a portion of those shares to AGC II in order to make a profit.

16. On or about December 9, 2010, the defendant MICHAEL LESLIE
COHEN wrote an e-mail to a London based Och Ziff employee, Co-Conspirator #3 (âCC-3â), an
individual whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, in which he acknowledged that the
Charitable Foundation would not approve the sale of shares of Strata by CC-2 to AGC II.
COHEN therefore proposed to have CC-1 sell CC-2âs shares of Strata to AGC II and agreed to

conceal CC-2âs interest in the transaction.
E, COHENâs Interest in John Doeâs Shares of Strata

17. In or around November 2009, the defendant MICHAEL LESLIE COHEN
purchased 932.8 shares of Strata from John Doe for approximately Great British Pounds
(âGBPâ) Â£971,000.

18. | Onor about November 23, 2010, the defendant MICHAEL LESLIE
| COHEN sent an e-mail to John Doe attaching a proposed share purchase agreement regarding
the 932.8 shares of Strata. Pursuant to the agreement between COHEN and John Doe, COHEN
agreed to sell back to John Doe the 932.8 shares of Strata. That same day, COHEN also
received a dividend from Strata in the amount of GBP Â£202,417.60. Thereafter, John Doe sold
the same 932.8 shares of Strata to AGC II.

F, COHEN Fraudulently Induced the Charitable Foundation to Consent
to AGC IIâs Purchase of Shares of Strata

19. The defendant MICHAEL LESLIE COHEN arranged for AGC II to
purchase up to ten percent of the shares in Strata by purchasing Strata shares from CC-1, CC-2
and John Doe.

20. Onor about December 16, 2010, as part of obtaining the required conflict
waiver from the Charitable Foundation, CC-3 sent an e-mail from his Och-Ziff e-mail address to
the Charitable Foundation attaching an investment proposal memorandum and an AGC II
Advisory Committee consent form for the Strata transaction. The investment proposal
memorandum stated that AGC II would purchase shares of Strata from two sources: (a) a special
purpose vehicle (âSPVâ) controlled by CC-1; and (b) an SPV controlled by John Doe. The
investment proposal did not provide for the purchase of any Strata shares directly from CC-2 or
from the defendant MICHAEL LESLIE COHEN himself. COHEN provided this and other
information to the Och-Ziff personnel who drafted the Advisory Committee consent form.

8
21. |The AGC II Advisory Committee consent form provided to the Charitable
Foundation requested the Charitable Foundationâs consent to the transaction and failed to
accurately disclose the conflicts of interest that arose from AGC IIâs purchase of Strata shares,
including:

(a) That one of the sellers of the Strata shares, CC-1, owed COHEN
millions of dollars on the delinquent $18 million personal loan;

(b) That COHEN had signed a release on the shares CC-1 would be
selling to AGC II, which had been pledged as collateral for the $18 million personal loan;

(c) That COHEN had arranged to personally receive a $4 million
payment from CC-1 on or before December 31, 2010;

(d) | That COHEN had arranged for CC-1 to sell CC-2âs shares of
Strata to AGC II in order to hide CC-2âs identity as a seller; and

(e) That COHEN had sold back to John Doe 932.8 Strata shares while
understanding that those same shares would in turn be sold to AGC II.

22. On or about December 16, 2010, the Charitable Foundation executed the
materially misleading and incomplete AGC II Advisory Committee consent form regarding the
Strata share transaction, thus waiving the improperly disclosed conflicts of interest, and sent the
executed form by e-mail to CC-3, who, later that day, forwarded the executed consent form by
e-mail to the defendant MICHAEL LESLIE COHEN.

23. On or about December 16, 2010, an Och-Ziff employee located in New
York, New York executed drawdown notices to raise the funds for the purchase of the Strata
shares. These drawdown notices were addressed to the Charitable Foundation and the other

limited partners of AGC II.

24. Onor about December 16, 2010, the Charitable Foundation requested a
drawdown from one of the Och-Ziff Hedge Funds to fund the AGC II capital call for the
purchase of Strata shares. This request was approved by an Och-Ziff employee in New York,
New York. On or about December 21, 2010, the Charitable Foundation redeemed $9,830,300
of its interest in an Och-Ziff Hedge Fund to fund the purchase of Strata shares.

25. On or about December 24, 2010, AGC II purchased 4,000 shares of Strata
for a total price of $19,684,000 (approximately $4,921 per share) purportedly from two sellers:
1,900 shares from CC-1 ($9,349,900); and 2,100 shares from John Doe ($10,334,100). The
Charitable Foundation did not know that: (a) 817 of the 1,900 shares purportedly sold by CC-1
actually belonged to CC-2; (b) $4 million of the proceeds of CC-1âs sale of his/her 1,083 Strata
shares would be paid to the defendant MICHAEL LESLIE COHEN in connection with his/her
personal loan; and (c) 932.8 of the 2,100 shares purportedly sold by John Doe had just been
transferred to John Doe by COHEN.

26. | Onor about December 24, 2010, Northern Trust (Guernsey) Limited sent
a wire transfer on behalf of AGC II in the amount of $9,349,900 for the purpose of purchasing
the Strata shares purportedly owned by CC-1. The wire transfer was routed to an account
controlled by CC-1 at Investec Bank (Channel Islands) Limited (âInvestec Bankââ) through
Northern Trust International Banking Corporation in Jersey City, New Jersey and JPMorgan
_ Chase Bank in New York. The funds were credited to the Investec Bank account on or about
December 29, 2010. The same day, CC-1 made a payment on his/her personal loan to the
defendant MICHAEL LESLIE COHEN by sending COHEN a wire transfer of $4,000,000 from
the proceeds of the sale of Strata shares. The wire transfer was routed through JPMorgan Chase

Bank in New York.

10
27. On or about January 5, 2011, CC-1 caused Investec Bank to send two wire
transfers in the total amount of $4,020,457 for the benefit of CC-2. Both wires were routed
through accounts at JPMorgan Chase Bank in New York and Barclays Bank in New York. The
wired money represented proceeds of CC-2âs indirect sale of Strata shares to AGC II.

III. Obstruction of Justice and False Statements
A. The Investigations

28. On or about June 10, 2011, the SEC opened an investigation of Och-Ziff,
its employees and agents into, among other things, the payment of bribes through or with CC-1
to secure an investment from the Libyan Investment Authority, a sovereign wealth fund in Libya
(the âSEC Investigationâ). CC-1âs relationships and dealings with employees of Och-Ziff were
relevant and important to the SEC Investigation.

29. Onor about January 14, 2013, a grand jury in the Eastern District of New
York opened a criminal investigation into the activities of Och-Ziff and its employees and agents
(the âGrand Jury Investigationâ). CC-1âs relationships and dealings with employees of Och-Ziff
were relevant and important to the Grand Jury Investigation.

B. The Defendantâs Obstruction of the SEC and Grand Jury Investigations

30. Onor about February 14, 2012, the SEC served a subpoena on Och-Ziff.
The February 14, 2012 subpoena required Och-Ziff to produce, among other things, all
documents related to CC-1 that were created between January 1, 2005 and the date of the
subpoena.

31. In or about March 2012, the defendant MICHAEL LESLIE COHEN
informed CC-1 that Och-Ziff was under investigation by the SEC, and asked CC-1 to author a

letter stating that CC-1 would not use Strata stock sale proceeds to repay COHEN any portion of

11
the $18 million personal loan related to a yacht. COHEN asked CC-1 to backdate the letter to
October 2010 in order to create the false appearance that the letter preceded the Strata stock sale.

32. On or about March 19, 2012, CC-1, together with others, created the letter
requested by the defendant MICHAEL LESLIE COHEN, falsely dating it October 14, 2010 (the
âBackdated Letterâ). Shortly thereafter, CC-1 provided the Backdated Letter to COHEN who,
in turn, provided a copy of the Backdated Letter to lawyers at Och-Ziff and represented that the
Backdated Letter was responsive to the SEC subpoena issued to Och-Ziff.

33. | Onor about September 24, 2012, the SEC served the defendant
MICHAEL LESLIE COHEN with a subpoena in his personal capacity. That subpoena required
COHEN to produce, among other things, all documents related to or concerning CC-1 that were
created between January 1, 2005 and the date of the subpoena. On or about November 27,
2012, COHEN, through his attorney, produced the Backdated Letter to the SEC in response to
the September 24, 2012 subpoena.

34. On or about May 9, 2013, counsel for Och-Ziffâs Audit Committee
(âAudit Committee Counselâ) attended a meeting at the United States Attorneyâs Office for the
Eastern District of New York (ââUSAO-EDNYââ) in Brooklyn, New York with representatives
from the USAO-EDNY, the U.S. Department of Justice, Criminal Division, Fraud Section
(âFraud Sectionâ), the FBI and the SEC in connection with both the SEC and the Grand Jury
Investigations. At this meeting, based on representations that had been made by the defendant
MICHAEL LESLIE COHEN, Audit Committee Counsel produced a hardcopy of the Backdated
Letter to, among others, a Special Agent of the FBI and an SEC attorney.

35. On or about May 30, 2013, the defendant MICHAEL LESLIE COHEN

attended a meeting at the USAO-EDNY with attorneys from the USAO-EDNY and the Fraud

Section, law enforcement agents of the FBI and IRS and an attorney for the SEC. In that
meeting, COHEN falsely stated that the Backdated Letter was not backdated and that COHEN
had received it from CC-1 shortly after he had first discussed having AGC II purchase Strata
shares from CC-1 in or about late 2010.

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA APPLICATION TO SEAL
THE INDICTMENT

- against -

MICHAEL LESLIE COHEN, DeARCY HALL, J.
Defendant. S OLD, Me J.

The United States of America, by and through its attorney, BRIDGET M.
ROHDE, Acting United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, hereby moves
for an order sealing the indictment in the above-captioned case. The reason for this request
is that the defendant, a dual citizen of the United States and the United Kingdom, is currently
at liberty outside the United States with access to significant resources and the government
plans to effectuate his arrest in the near future. The government seeks to seal the indictment
to ensure that the defendant does not learn that he is under indictment and to prevent him

from fleeing justice to avoid arrest and prosecution.
Case 1:17-cr-00544-NGG Document 1-1 Filed 10/05/17 Page 2 of 2 PagelD #: 23

Notably, the indictment has been returned within the applicable statute of
limitations and sealing is not requested simply to toll the statute.
