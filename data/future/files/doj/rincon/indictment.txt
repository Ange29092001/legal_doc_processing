THE GRAND JURY CHARGES:
COUNT ONE

(Conspiracy â 18 U.S.C. Â§ 371)
Introduction

At all relevant times, unless otherwise specified:

1. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (âFCPAâ), as amended,
Title 15, United States Code, Sections 78dd-1, et seg., was enacted by Congress for
the purpose of, among other things, making it unlawful to act corruptly in
furtherance of an offer, promise, authorization, or payment of money or anything
of value, directly or indirectly, to a foreign official for the purpose of obtaining or
retaining business for, or directing business to, any person.

2. Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (ââPDVSAâ) was the Venezuelan state-

owned and state-controlled oil company. PDVSA and its subsidiaries and affiliates
were responsible for the exploration, production, refining, transportation, and trade
in energy resources in Venezuela and provided funding for other operations of the
Venezuelan government. PDVSA Services, Inc. was the U.S.-based affiliate of
PDVSA located in Houston, Texas, that, at various times, was responsible for
international purchasing on behalf of PDVSA. Bariven S.A. was the PDVSA
procurement subsidiary responsible for equipment purchases. PDVSA and its
wholly owned subsidiaries, including PDVSA Services, Inc. and Bariven S.A.,
(hereinafter collectively referred to as âPDVSAâ) were âinstrumentalitiesâ of the
Venezuelan government as that term is used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States
Code, Section 78dd-2(h)(2)(A). PDVSA officers and employees were âforeign
officialsâ as that term is used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Sections
78dd-2(h)(2)(A) and 78dd-3(f)(2)(A).

3. PDVSA awarded contracts for energy services and equipment in a
number of ways, including through a competitive bidding process. One such
competitive bidding process began with a PDVSA purchasing analyst assembling a
bidding panel, which identified those companies that would be invited to submit
bids in connection for a particular project. PDVSA would then issue a request for
quotation to the companies included on the bidding panel and those companies

would in turn submit formal bids, from which a winner would be selected.
PDVSA also awarded sole source contracts, which were not subject to a

competitive bidding process.

false and fraudulent pretenses, representations, and promises, and to
transmit and cause to be transmitted, by means of wire communication in

sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme and artifice in violation

of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1343.

co-conspirators, to enrich themselves by obtaining and retaining lucrative energy
contracts with PDVSA through corrupt and fraudulent means, including by paying

bribes to PDVSA officials.

11
de led ee ae

Manner and Means of the Conspiracy

26. The manner and means by which RINCON and SHIERA and their
co-conspirators sought to accomplish the purpose of the conspiracy included,
among other things, the following, while in the Southern District of Texas and
elsewhere:

27. RINCON and SHIERA, together with others, discussed how they
would obtain and retain contracts with PDVSA by providing things of value to
PDVSA officials.

28. RINCON and SHIERA, together with others, paid bribes to PDVSA
officials through the use of interstate and foreign wires in order to influence acts
and decisions of the PDVSA officials in their official capacities and to induce the
PDVSA officials to do and omit to do certain acts, including, but not limited to:

a. assisting RINCONâs and SHIERAâs companies in winning PDVSA

contracts;

b. providing RINCON and SHIERA with inside information concerning

the PDVSA bidding process;

c. placing one or more of RINCONâs and SHIERAâs companies on certain

bidding panels for PDVSA projects;

than one of the companies on certain bidding panels for PDVSA projects;

12
wd

e. supporting RINCONâs and SHIERAâs companies before an internal
PDVSA purchasing committee;

f. preventing interference with the selection of RINCONâs and SHIERAâs
companies for PDVSA contracts;

g. updating and modifying contract documents, including change orders to
PDVSA contracts awarded to RINCONâs and SHIERAâs companies;

h. assisting RINCONâs and SHIERAâs companies in receiving payment
for previously awarded PDVSA contracts, including by requesting
payment priority for projects involving RINCONâs and SHIERAâs
companies.

29. RINCON and SHIERA, together with others, caused bribe payments
to be wired from the bank accounts of RINCON, RINCONâs companies, and
SHIERAâs companies to the bank accounts of PDVSA officials, their relatives, or
other individuals or entities designated by the PDVSA officials who received the
bribes.

30. In addition to monetary bribes, RINCON and SHIERA, together with
others, bribed PDVSA officials by providing things of value, including recreational
travel, meals, and entertainment, in order to obtain and retain business on behalf of

RINCONâs and SHIERAâs companies.

13
31. RINCON and SHIERA, together with others, referred to the PDVSA
officials who were assisting them in obtaining and retaining contracts with PDVSA
in exchange for bribes as âaliados,â which translates into English as âalliesâ or
âallieds.â

32. RINCON and SHIERA, together with others, provided to certain
PDVSA officials who were receiving bribes proposed bidding panel lists that
would include more than one company controlled by RINCON or SHIERA to
create the false appearance that the bidding process was competitive.

33. RINCON and SHIERA, together with others, relayed to certain
PDVSA officials who were receiving bribes instructions as to which company
among the proposed bidding panel the officials should select as the winning bidder.

34. RINCON and SHIERA, together with others, kept track of the
amounts owed and paid to each PDVSA official based on the contracts that the
PDVSA official had helped to award to one or more of RINCONâs and
SHIERAâs companies.

35. RINCON and SHIERA, together with others, attempted to conceal
the fact that they controlled multiple companies contained on the proposed bidding
panel lists provided to certain PDVSA officials who were receiving bribes,

including by appointing nominal owners or managers for those companies.

14
de led ee ae

36. RINCON and SHIERA, together with others, attempted to conceal
the bribes to certain PDVSA officials, which they referred to as âcommissions,â by
creating false justifications for the bribes, including requesting or receiving
invoices for equipment that was not provided and services that were never

rendered in order to disguise the bribe payments to the PDVSA officials.
Overt Acts

37. In furtherance of the conspiracy and to achieve the objects thereof, at
least one of the co-conspirators committed or caused to be committed, in the
Southern District of Texas and elsewhere, at least one of the following overt acts,
among others:

40. Onor about October 22, 2009, Associate 2 sent Official C an e-mail
in Spanish explaining the strategy for the PDVSA bidding process as it related to

companies owned by SHIERA, stating that for instances where Shiera Company 1
15
de led ee ae

would be invited to submit bids, Associate 2 and Official C needed to first ensure
that Shiera Company | would meet certain conditions and that Official C would be
the PDVSA buyer responsible for assembling the panel, and that, as translated into
English, âIf that is the case, tell me so Ican send you a panel of companies that I
know will not make an offer, or they will make offers higher than ours. It is
indispensable to have the complete description of the request to seek out pricing
beforehand. When starting the process, it is also indispensable that you require a
short submission offer timeframe (3days). Well buddy, I believe that if we follow
these strategies, that shit is ours.â

4]. Inor around early 2010, Associate 2 helped Official B to open a bank
account in Panama, in order to receive bribe payments outside Venezuela.

42. Onor about April 9, 2010, RINCON caused $100,000 to be
