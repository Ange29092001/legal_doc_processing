Respondentâ).

II.

In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer
of Settlement (the âOfferâ) which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, Respondent admits the Commissionâs
jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of these proceedings, and consents to the entry of
this Order Instituting Cease-and-Desist Proceedings, Pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities

as set forth below.

Il.

On the basis of this Order and Respondentâs Offer, the Commission findsâ that:

 

' The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondentâs Offer of Settlement and are not binding on any

other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.
Summary

1. This matter concerns violations of the anti-bribery, books and records and internal
controls provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (âFCPAâ) by Vicente E. Garcia
(âGarciaâ), a U.S. citizen and the head of Latin American sales for SAP SE (âSAPâ), a European
Union corporation headquartered in Waldorf, Germany. SAP provides technology solutions and
services in approximately 188 countries and has more than 68,000 employees. Garcia and others
offered to pay bribes to two government officials, and paid bribes of at least $145,000 to another
senior government official of the Republic of Panama in order to secure software license sales of
approximately $3.7 million to various government agencies; the sales were recorded initially in
the books and records of SAP Mexico and subsequently consolidated into the financial
statements of SAP. Garcia circumvented SAPâs internal controls by falsely justifying the
discount amount offered to its local partner. In doing so Garcia helped to facilitate the local
partnerâs ability to generate excess earnings on the final, end-user sale, which earnings were then
used to create a slush fund to finance the bribes paid to government officials.

Respondent

2. Vicente E. Garcia (age 65), a U.S. citizen residing in Miami, Florida, was the
Vice-President of Global and Strategic Accounts, responsible for sales in Latin America for SAP
from February 2008 until April 2014.

Related Entities

3. SAP SE (âSAPâ) is a European Union corporation headquartered in Waldorf,
Germany, that provides technology solutions and services in over 180 countries. SAPâs
American Depository Shares are registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of the
Securities Act of 1933, and listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

4. SAP International, Inc. (ââSAPIâ), a Miami, Florida-based wholly-owned
subsidiary of SAP, is engaged in selling software in the North and Latin American and
Caribbean markets. SAPI does not enter into direct or indirect software or software-related
services deals with end customers. Instead, SAPI employs some of the members of the Latin
America and Caribbean (âLACâ) regional leadership team and provides some back office
operational support for some of the LAC regional subsidiaries. Garcia was on the payroll of
SAPI, but he reported to managers of both SAPI and SAPâs Brazilian subsidiary, and his
reporting chain ultimately went up to SAP in Germany.

 

5. SAP Mexico S.A. de C.V. (âSAP Mexicoâ) is a Mexico City, Mexico-based
wholly-owned subsidiary of SAP engaged in selling software in the Mexican and Central
American markets. SAP Mexico is authorized by SAP to distribute, sell, license, and sublicense
software directly and indirectly to end customers. SAP Mexico is also authorized to provide
customers with software-related services such as implementation, maintenance, training, and
consulting. Garcia negotiated the Panamanian contracts on behalf of SAP Mexico. SAP
Mexicoâs financial statements are consolidated and reported in SAPâs financial statements.

 
Facts

6. From at least June 2009 through November 2013, Garcia, along with others,
planned and executed a scheme to offer and pay bribes to three senior government officials of the
Republic of Panama in order to obtain approximately $3.7 million worth of software sales by
SAP to the Panamanian government. Garcia, in concert with others, paid bribes to one
Panamanian government official in the amount of $145,000, and promised to pay bribes to two
other government officials, all in contravention of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (the
âFCPAâ).

7. Garcia was SAPâs Vice-President of Global and Strategic Accounts, responsible
for sales in Latin America from February 2008 until April 2014, when SAP requested that he
resign for his misconduct discussed herein. Garcia was employed by SAPI and worked on large
deals all over Latin America using resources and personnel from other SAP subsidiaries
including SAP Mexico.

8. SAP, through its 272 subsidiaries, sells software licenses and related services to
263,000 customers in 188 countries. SAPâs global business is directed and operated from its
headquarters in Waldorf, Germany and executed through its numerous subsidiaries.
Approximately 15% of SAPâs sales are directly to the customer. The remainder of SAPâs
business is conducted through a network of more than 11,500 partners worldwide that provide an
additional workforce of 380,000 individuals skilled in SAP software solutions and technology.
SAPâs sales using a partner can be either (1) a direct sale to a customer with a sales commission
paid to a partner that provides assistance, (11) an indirect sale through a partner that purchases the
software license and resells it to a customer at an independently determined increased price, or
(111) a direct sale to the partner, which acts as a distributor and independently resells the software
licenses to customers in the future.

9. In June 2009, Garciaâs business associate, a Panamanian lobbyist (the
âLobbyistâ), informed Garcia about potential software sales opportunities with the government
of Panama and that he had an existing relationship with the newly elected government, including
a high ranking Government Official A, who was tasked with improving technology solutions
across multiple government agencies in Panama and had significant influence over Panamaâs
software purchasing decisions. Thereafter, SAP began investigating possible software sales to
the Panamanian government. Initially this endeavor was led by local SAP sales employees in
Mexico. Garcia, however, took over the business opportunity by recommending that SAP
designate the Panama government as part of the Premier Customer Network â a group of large,
strategically important, regional customers â which Garcia headed.

10. On February 9, 2010, Government Official A asked in an e-mail whether SAP
could send him a letter inviting him to Mexico for âsome fictional meetings in order to justify a
trip there on Monday and Tuesday of Carnival.â The same day, Garcia acceded to the request
and sent an e-mail to Government Official A with an attached fictitious letter on SAP letterhead
inviting him âto Mexico City so that you can directly and personally evaluate the benefits that
the Government of Mexico has obtained by adopting our products and services.â The letter also
included a fictitious itinerary of proposed meetings that never occurred. The next day, on
February 10, Garcia sent an e-mail from his personal Yahoo! e-mail account inquiring about
possible business opportunities from Government Official A stating: âAny news... ? Was the
document OK for him? Can you ask him to finalize a deal for us in Feb-March, I need between
$5 and $10 million.â

11. In late February 2010, Garcia and another SAP employee traveled from Miami,
Florida to Panama and met with Government Official A and others to discuss business
opportunities. Thereafter, in April 2010, Garcia began preparing a proposal to sell
approximately $29 million worth of software licenses to the Panamanian social security agency,
anticipating that this sale would be the first of multiple deals with various ministries and
agencies of the Panamanian government totaling over $100 million. Ultimately, some of these
additional sales never materialized and others were smaller than expected.

12. Garcia and others were informed by the Lobbyist that in order to obtain these
contracts from the government of Panama, they needed to bribe three Panamanian government
officials that had significant influence in the Panamanian governmentâs award of contracts to
purchase software.

13. In anticipation of the sales to the government of Panama, Garcia and others began
planning the details of the bribery scheme. On June 9 and 10, 2010, Garcia discussed with
others, including via e-mail, their plans to pay bribes to Government Official A (2% of the value
of the contract) and Government Official B (10%), and receive kickbacks for themselves (2%).
Also, on October 26, 2010, e-mails were exchanged with two attached spreadsheets referencing
planned payments to Government Officials A and C of approximately $100,000 and $300,000,
respectively.

14. To facilitate payments to Government Official B, the Lobbyist proposed using a
sham contract for fictitious services to be provided by Government Official Bâs brother-in-lawâs
company. On June 17, 2010, Government Official A received two draft sham contracts with the
stated purpose of having these two back-to-back contracts so that âno trace remains if SAP
conducts an audit... . I made it as simple as possible and made it look like a real contract.â On
June 18, 2010, the Lobbyist e-mailed Garcia an unsigned corrected copy of the proposed
consulting agreement, which provided that Government Official Bâs brother-in-lawâs company
would receive â10% (ten percent) for performance of its Services and Consulting dutiesâ relating
to all âbusiness opportunitiesâ with the Panamanian government.

15. On October 19, 2011, the Lobbyist e-mailed a spreadsheet to Government Official
C indicating that they would share $274,000 in 2011 and $226,000 in 2012. On January 9, 2013,
another business associate of Garcia e-mailed Government Official A stating that Garcia and his
business associate had agreed to give Government Official A some of their kickback so that
Government Official A could receive a larger âcommissionâ of $150,000. In addition, the
business associate confirmed that Government Official A already had been paid $45,000 and
acknowledged that $105,000 was still outstanding.
16. As aresult of Garciaâs conduct in the bribery scheme, SAP, with its local partner,
was able to sell software to the Panamanian government through four contracts from 2010 to
2013. These contracts generated revenues of $3.7 million to SAP.

17. One of the four contracts was a software license sale to the Panamanian social
security agency, which was initially proposed to be a direct sale with the assistance of local
partners. In order to facilitate the bribery scheme, the existing partners were replaced with a new
local Panamanian partner. Because SAP refused to pay additional commission to this new
Panamanian company, Garcia and others began looking for other ways to advance the bribery
scheme. Finally, in the fall of 2010, Garcia finalized an indirect sale of the software license to
the agency through the local partner, which, with Garciaâs assistance, ultimately sought and
obtained an 82% discount on the sale price. Garcia caused various approval forms to be
submitted that misstated the reasons for the large discount. Garcia stated that the discounts were
necessary to compete with other software companies in establishing a relationship with the
government of Panama when, in fact, the discounts were necessary to pay bribes to government
officials. Garcia and others planned to sell SAP software to the intermediary at an 82% discount,
who in turn would sell them at significantly higher prices to the Panamanian government and use
part of the profits from the sale to pay bribes.

18. SAP agreed to sell the software licenses for the Panamanian social security
agency to the local partner for approximately $2.1 million. In November 2010, the local partner
successfully bid $14.5 million for the contract, which was awarded by the Panamanian
government on January 31, 2011. Garcia, along with others, planned to pay bribes to
Panamanian government officials from the proceeds of the software sale to the government of
Panama.

19. Thereafter, as noted above, between June 2012 and December 2013, the
Panamanian government awarded three additional contracts that included SAP software products
valued at approximately $13.5 million, which were also sold at deep discounts by SAP to its
local partner. For these contracts also, Garcia and others agreed to pay bribes to Panamanian
officials from the proceeds of the software sales.

20. Between April 11, 2012 and August 13, 2013, Garcia and his business associate
paid at least $145,000 in bribes to Government Official A. Between December 27, 2011 and
October 29, 2012, another Garcia business associate paid Garcia a kickback of approximately
$85,965 in his bank account in Florida from the proceeds of the sale of SAP software licenses to
the Panamanian government. Thus, Garcia, with the assistance of others, bribed one government
official and promised to pay bribes to two other government officials to obtain contracts to sell
software to Panamanian government, all in violation of the FCPA.

Legal Standards and Violations

21. Section 30A(a) of the Exchange Act sets forth the anti-bribery provisions of the
FCPA. It prohibits an issuer any officer, director, employee or agent of such issuer or any
stockholder thereof acting on behalf of such issuer from using the âmails or any means or
instrumentality of interstate commerce corruptly in furtherance of an offer, payment, promise to
pay, or authorization of the paymentâ of money to any person, while knowing that all or a

5
portion of such money âwill be offered, given, or promised, directly or indirectly, to any foreign
official ... for purposes ofâ, among other things, âinducing such foreign official ... in order to
assist such issuer in obtaining or retaining business for or with, or directing business to, any
person.â

22. By engaging in the conduct described above, Garcia, as an agent of SAP, violated
Section 30A in connection with the sale of software licenses and other related services to the
government of Panama. On behalf of SAP, Garcia participated in structuring the deal as an
indirect sale through the local partner, with the understanding that it would act as a conduit to
send corrupt payments to several government officials. Garcia, along with others, promised to
make bribe payments to two senior government officials and made bribe payments to another
government official, all in violation of the FCPA. Garcia used the mails and other means and
instrumentalities of interstate commerce to bribe government officials. Garcia used his SAP e-
mail account and his personal Yahoo! e-mail account to plan and execute the bribery scheme. In
addition, as part of the bribery scheme, Garcia flew from Miami to Panama to meet with
government officials and others, and Garcia received $85,965 in âkickbacksâ into his bank
account in Florida.

23. Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act provides that no person shall knowingly
circumvent or knowingly fail to implement a system of internal accounting controls or
knowingly falsify any book, record or account of an issuer described in Section 13(b)(2) of the
Exchange Act. Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 prohibits any person from, directly or indirectly,
falsifying or causing to be falsified any book, record, or account subject to Exchange Act Section
13(b)(2)(A). Scienter is not an element of a Rule 13b2-1 violation. See SEC v. McNulty, 137
F.2d 732, 740-41 (2"* Cir. 1998).

24. Garcia knowingly falsified SAP Mexicoâs books and records by engaging in a
scheme to create a slush fund at the local partner, which was used to pay bribes to Panamanian
government officials. Garcia also knowingly circumvented the companyâs internal controls to
change the sale of the software licenses from a direct sale to the government of Panama to an
indirect sale through intermediaries at deep discounts in order to facilitate payments to
government officials. Specifically, Garcia justified the deep discounts by falsely claiming in
approval forms that the discounts were necessary to beat competitors and obtain entry into the
Panamanian market when, in fact, the discounts were necessary to generate funds to pay bribes
to government officials. With respect to the leisure trip for Government Official A, Garcia
prepared a fictitious letter and itinerary, and even used a personal e-mail account to avoid
detection of his corrupt activities. Finally, despite signing SAPâs Code of Conduct prohibiting
bribery, he engaged in an elaborate bribery scheme. Accordingly, Garcia violated Section
13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 13b2-1.
