Defendants.

 

COMPLAINT
Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (âthe Commissionâ) alleges as
follows:
SUMMARY
1. This matter involves Defendant Schering-Plough Corporationâs (âSchering-
Ploughâ) violations of the books and records and internal controls provisions of the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (âFCPAâ), Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ). Between February 1999 and March
2002, Schering-Plough Poland paid 315,800 zlotys (PLN) (approximately $76,000) to a
charitable foundation to induce the foundationâs president, who was also a Polish
government official, to influence the purchase of Schering-Ploughâs pharmaceutical
products. None of the payments to the charity was accurately reflected in Schering:
Ploughâs books and records. Additionally, Schcring-Ploughâs system of internal

accounting controls was inadequate to prevent or detect the improper payments.
JURISDICTION

2. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Scction 27 of the

Exchange Act.
DEFENDANT

3. Schering-Plough Corporation (âSchering-Ploughâ) is a New Jersey
corporation with its headquarters in Kenilworth, New Jersey. Its common stock is
registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and is
listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

OTHER RELEVANT ENTITIES

4. Schering-Plough Poland (âS-P Polandâ), headquartered in Warsaw, Poland, is

 

a branch office of Schering-Plough Central East AG, a wholly owned Swiss subsidiary of
Schering-Plough that is headquartered in Lucerne Switzerland.

5. The Chudow Castle Foundation (âFoundationâ) is a charitable organization that

 

was established in 1995 to restore castles and other historic sites in the Silesian region of
Poland. The founder and President of the Foundation was the Director of the Silesian Health
Fund (âDirectorâ), one of sixteen regional government health authorities in Poland.
FACTS

6. The Silesian Health Fund was a government body that, among other things,
provided monies for the purchase of pharmaceutical products and influenced the purchase of
those products by other entities, such as hospitals, through the allocation of health fund
resources. In February 1999, shortly after the Director assumed his position of leadership in

the Silesian Health Fund, S-P Poland made the first of a series of payments to the Foundation.
7. In early 2000, the Director solicited S-P Polandâs oncology unit manager (âthe
Managerâ) to make additional payments to the Foundation. Between March 2000 and
March 2002, the Manager arranged for twelve additional payments from S-P Poland to
the Foundation. Somc of these payments were structured so that they were at or below
the Managerâs approval limit, apparently for the purpose of concealing the nature of the
payments. Moreover, the Manager provided false medical justifications for most of the
payments on the documents that he submitted to the companyâs finance department. In
total, S-P Poland paid 315,800 PLN (approximately $76,000) to the Foundation, as

summarized in the table below.

8. S-P Poland paid more money to the Foundation than any other recipient of
promotional donations. During 2000 and 2001, the payments to the Foundation
constituted approximately 40% and 20%, respectively, of S-P Polandâs total promotional
donations budget. Morcover, the Foundation was the only recipient of such donations
that received multiple payments, making the four payments in 2000 and seven payments
in 2001 highly unusual.

9. All of the payments to the Foundation were classified by S-P Poland in its
books and records as donations. However, while the payments in fact were made to a
bona fide charity, they were made to influence the Director with respect to the purchase
of Schering-Ploughâs products. In fact, the Manager did not view the payments to the
Foundation as charitable, but as âduesâ that were required to be paid for assistance from
the Director.

10. During the period in which the payments were being made to the Foundation,
S-P Polandâs sales of Intron A and Temodal, two of its oncology products, increased
disproportionately compared with sales of those products in other regions of Poland. By
2002, 53% of the Intron A and 40% of the Temodal sold in Poland were in Silesia.

if. Prior to March 2002, Schering-Ploughâs policies and procedures for detecting
possible FCPA violations by its foreign subsidiaries were inadequate in that they did not
require employees to conduct any due diligence prior to making promotional or charitable
donations to determine whether any government officials were affiliated with proposed
recipients. For this reason, the Director of the Silesian Health Fundâs relationship to the

Foundation was never considered by S-P Poland as a potential FCPA issue.
12. S-P Polandâs internal policies provided that promotional donations generally
were supposed to be made to healthcare institutions and relate to the practice of medicine.
Although the Foundation represented to S-P Poland that its by-laws permitted the
Foundation to engage in healthcare related programs, the Commission alleges that the
Manager knew that the Foundation did not, in fact, engage in such programs.

13. The company should have becn alerted to the fact that there were FCPA issues
rclating to S-P Polandâs payments to the Foundation, because: (i) the Foundation is not a
healthcare related entity, yet still received payments; (11) of the magnitude of the
payments to the Foundation in relation to the companyâs budget for such donations; (iii)
of the apparent structuring of certain payments by the Manager, which allowed him to
exceed his authorization limits; and (iv) the Director was the founder and President of
Foundation and also a Polish government official with the ability to influence the
purchase of S-P Polandâs products by hospitals within the Silesian Health Fund.

Violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(B)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act
(Books and Records and Internal Controls)
14.â Paragraphs 1 through 13 are hereby realleged and incorporated by reference.
15. By reason of the foregoing, Schering Plough violated Sections 13(b)(2)(A)

and 13(B)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act.
PRAYER FOR RELIEF

16. The Commission respectfully requests that this Court enter a Final Judgment

against Defendant Schering-Plough Corporation ordering it to pay a civil penalty

pursuant to Section 21(d)(3) of the Exchange Act.
