SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, | Case No.

Plaintiff,
vs. |
UTSTARCOM, INC.,

Defendant.

âCOMPLAINT

 

 

 

Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (the âCommissionâ) alleges:

SUMMARY OF ACTION

1. This matter involves repeated bribe payments to foreign officials by Bay Area

telecommunications company UTStarcom, Inc. (âUTSIâ or âthe companyâ) in violation of the

Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (ââFCPAâ). Between 2002 and 2007, UTSI paid nearly $7 million

for hundreds of overseas trips by employees of Chinese government-controlled

telecommunications companies that were customers of UTSI, purportedly to provide customer

training. In reality, the trips were entirely or primarily for sightseeing.

De During the same time period, UTSI provided other gifts and benefits to foreign

government customers, including paying for them to attend executive training programs at U.S.

universities. UTSI also provided foreign government customers or their family members with
work visas and purportedly hired them to work for UTSI in the U.S., when in reality they did no
work for the company. UTS] also made payments to purported consultants in China and Mongolia
who provided no documented services, under circumstances that showed a high probability that the
payments would be used to bribe foreign government officials.

3. The Commission seeks an order permanently enjoining UTSI from violations of
the anti-bribery, books and records, and internal control provisions of the FCPA, and requiring
UTSI to pay a civil monetary penalty.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 21(d) and 27 of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ) [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78u(d) and 78aa].
Defendant has, directly or indirectly, made use of the means and instrumentalities of interstate
commerce and of the mails in connection with the acts, transactions, practices and courses of
business alleged in this Complaint.

5. Venue in this District is proper pursuant to Section 27 of the Exchange Act [15
U.S.C. Â§ 78aa] because Defendant maintains its headquarters and transacts business within the
Northern District of California.

6. Intradistrict assignment to the San Francisco Division is proper pursuant to Civil
L.R. 3-2(c) because a substantial part of the events or omissions that give rise to this action
occurred in the County of Alameda.

DEFENDANT

7. UTStarcom, Inc. is a Delaware corporation with headquarters in Alameda,
California. UTSI is a global telecommunications company that designs, manufactures and sells
network equipment and handsets. UTSIâs common stock is registered with the Commission
pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market
under the symbol âUTSI.â The majority of UTSIâs operations and employees are in China.
UTSI operates in China primarily through its wholly-owned subsidiary UTStarcom China Co.,
Ltd. (âUTS-Chinaâ).

8. On May 1, 2008, in a prior action involving multiple accounting irregularities
unrelated to the FCPA, the Commission issued an order finding that UTSI and certain of its
executives violated the corporate reporting, books and records and internal controls provisions of
the federal securities laws between 2000 and 2005. Without admitting or denying the
Commissionâs findings, UTSI agreed to cease and desist from committing such violations.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

A. UTSI Paid for Sightseeing Trips by Employees of Chinese Government Customers
Pursuant to Systems Contracts.

9. Historically, China has been UTSIâs most important market. Between 1995 and
2004, more than 75% of UTSIâs sales were to government-controlled municipal and provincial
telecommunications companies in China. From 2004 to 2008, the company attempted several
business ventures to expand outside of China. However, by 2008, China again became UTSIâs
largest market by sales.

10. UTSI grew rapidly until 2004 based on UTS-Chinaâs sales of wireless network
equipment for large cities in China. The initial sales contracts for the networks were referred to
as âsystems contracts.â

11. At least by 2002, UTS-Chinaâs standard practice was to include as part of each
systems contract a provision for UTS-China to pay for some of the customerâs employees to
attend purported training overseas at UTSI facilities after installation of the network.

12. After network installation was complete, UTS-China told the customer to contact
a particular travel agent to choose destinations for the trip and provide the list of employees who
would participate. Most trips lasted two weeks and cost USD $5,000 per customer employee.

13. UTS-China paid for the trips through the travel agent and accounted for the entire
cost as a training expense. UTS-Chinaâs financial results were a component of UTSIâs
consolidated financial statements.

14. Between 2002 and 2007, UTSI spent nearly $7 million on approximately 225 trips

for customer employees pursuant to training provisions in systems contracts.

15. Very little documentation was maintained relating to the trips, and UTSI did not
have adequate internal controls to determine whether the trips were in fact for training purposes.
On many of the trips, no training actually occurred. Instead, customer employees visited popular
tourist destinations where UTSI had no facilities.

B. UTSI Paid for Employees of Chinese Government Customers to Attend Executive
Training Programs at U.S. Universities.

16. On at least seven occasions between 2002 and 2004, UTSI paid for executive
training programs at U.S. universities that were attended by managers and other employees of
government customers in China. The programs covered general management topics and were
not specifically related to UTSIâs products or business.

17. UTSI paid for all expenses associated with the programs, which totaled more than
$4 million from 2002 to 2004. The expenses included travel, tuition, room and board, field trips
to nearby tourist destinations, and a cash allowance of between $800 and $3,000 per person.
UTSI accounted for the cost of the programs as marketing expenses.

18. UTSIâs senior management believed that the executive training programs helped
UTSI obtain or retain business. In late 2002, UTSIâs CEO and UTSIâs Executive Vice President
(who also served as CEO of UTS-China) approved increasing the budget for the programs in
2003 to provide a specific executive training program for employees of UTSIâs largest customer,
a Chinese government-controlled telecommunications company.

Cc. UTSI Provided Employment Benefits to Customers or Their Family Members.

19. On at least ten occasions between 2001 and 2005, UTSI provided or offered full-
time employment with UTSI in the U.S., including salaries and other benefits, to employees of
government customers or their family members in China and Thailand. These offers were made
for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business from the customers.

20. UTSI paid and provided benefits to at least three of these individuals for a period
of two years each as if they were real employees, even though they never worked for UTSI in

any capacity. Phony annual performance reviews were placed in personnel files for the

individuals to document their employment, and UTSI improperly accounted for the payments to
the individuals as employee compensation.

21. | UTSI also sponsored permanent U.S. residency applications falsely stating that
these three individuals would be full-time employees of UTSI in New Jersey. As a result, each

of the individuals received a green card.

D. UTSI Paid for Gifts and Entertainment Expenses of a Government Customer in
Thailand.

22. In 2004, as part of its effort to expand its business outside China, UTSI submitted
a bid for a sales contract to a government-controlled telecommunications company in Thailand.

23. | While UTSIâs bid was under consideration, UTSIâs general manager in Thailand
spent nearly $10,000 on French wine as a gift to agents of the government customer, including
rare bottles that cost more than $600 each. The manager also spent $13,000 for entertainment
expenses for the same customer in an attempt to secure the contract.

24.  UTSIâs former Executive Vice President and CEO of UTS-China approved the
payments. UTSI reimbursed the expenditures and accounted for them as marketing expenses.
E. UTSI Paid Consultants to Bribe Government Officials.

25. In 2005, UTSI attempted to expand its business into Mongolia. UTSIâs Executive
Vice President and CEO of UTS-China at that time authorized a $1.5 million payment to a
Mongolian company pursuant to a purported consulting agreement and told UTSIâs Board of
Directors that the $1.5 million was a license fee paid to the Mongolian government.

26. UTSI did not maintain records showing what services, if any, were actually
provided under the consulting agreement. UTSI accounted for the entire $1.5 million as a
license fee.

27.  Inreality, the license fee was only $50,000. UTSI agreed to work with the
Mongolian company and pay the $1.5 million because the Mongolian company had government
connections. UTSIâs Executive Vice President and CEO of UTS-China knew that the $1.5

million payment was not a license fee and that the Mongolian company used a portion of that

$1.5 million to make payments to at least one Mongolian government official to help UTSI
obtain a favorable ruling in a dispute over its license.

28. In early 2007, UTSIâs former Executive Vice President and CEO of UTS-China
authorized a $200,000 payment to a Chinese company pursuant to a purported consulting
agreement. Although the payment was accounted for as a consulting expense, no records were
maintained describing what services, if any, were actually provided. In reality, it was a sham
consulting company and the payment was made as part of an effort to obtain a contract from a
Chinese government customer.

F. UTSI Later Implemented Remedial Measures to Improve FCPA Compliance.

29. In 2006, after learning of alleged bribe payments in Mongolia, UTSIâs audit
committee conducted an internal investigation into potential FCPA violations, which UTSI
expanded in 2007 and 2008 to cover all of its operations worldwide. As a result of the internal
investigation, UTSI has adopted new FCPA-related policies and procedures, hired additional
finance and internal compliance personnel, implemented stronger internal accounting controls,
and conducted FCPA training at all of its major offices around the world. UTSIâs former
Executive Vice President and CEO of UTS-China, who resides in China, has not been affiliated
with UTSI or its subsidiaries in any capacity since 2007.

FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF

Violations of Section 30A of the Exchange Act (Anti-bribery Provision of the F' BCPA)
[15 U.S.C. Â§ 78dd-1]

30. | The-Commission realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through
29.

31. As described above, UTSI made or authorized payments in the form of money,
gifts or other things of value, to foreign officials for the purpose of influencing their official acts
and decisions and inducing them to use their influence to assist UTS] in obtaining or retaining
business. Throughout the relevant period, the recipients of these offers and payments were
foreign officials within the meaning of the FCPA, and the relevant foreign telecommunications

companies were instrumentalities of foreign governments within the meaning of the FCPA.
