YORK MELLON 1934, MAKING FINDINGS, AND
CORPORATION, IMPOSING A CEASE-AND-DESIST
ORDER
Respondent.
I.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (âCommissionâ) deems it appropriate that
cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 21C of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ), against The Bank of New York Mellon
Corporation (âBNY Mellonâ or âRespondentâ).

Il.

In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, BNY Mellon has submitted an
Offer of Settlement (the âOfferâ) which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for
the purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the
findings herein, except as to the Commissionâs jurisdiction over it and the subject matter of
these proceedings, which are admitted, BNY Mellon consents to the entry of this Order
Instituting Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, Making Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order (âOrderâ), as set
forth below.
Hil.

On the basis of this Order and BNY Mellonâs Offer, the Commission findsâ that:

Summary

1. This matter concerns violations of the anti-bribery and internal accounting
controls provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (âFCPAâ) by BNY Mellon. The
violations took place during 2010 and 2011, when employees of BNY Mellon sought to
corruptly influence foreign officials in order to retain and win business managing and
servicing the assets of a Middle Eastern sovereign wealth fund.

2. These officials sought, and BNY Mellon agreed to provide, valuable
internships for their family members. BNY Mellon provided the internships without
following its standard hiring procedures for interns, and the interns were not qualified for
BNY Mellonâs existing internship programs.

3. BNY Mellon failed to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting
controls around its hiring practices sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that its
employees were not bribing foreign officials in contravention of company policy.

BNY Mellon

4. BNY Mellon is a Delaware corporation with its headquarters in New York,
New York. The companyâs common stock is registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange
Act and listed on the New York Stock Exchange (ticker: BK). BNY Mellon and its various
subsidiaries provide banking and financial services in North America and elsewhere around
the globe, including in the Europe, Middle East, and Africa (âEMEAâ) region. Services
provided to EMEA region clients by BNY Mellon include custody and related services
through its global asset servicing unit (âBNYM Asset Servicingâ), and asset and wealth
management services through its global investment management business division (âBNYM
Asset Managementâ).

her Relevant Entiti nd Indivi ]

5. BNY Mellon Boutique (the âBoutiqueâ) is a wholly owned asset
management firm operating within BNYM Asset Management. Asset management services
provided by BNYM Asset Management are generally carried out in the EMEA region by
BNY Mellonâs various regional subsidiaries, including the Boutique.

6. Middle Eastern Sovereign Wealth Fund (the âMiddle Eastern Sovereign
Wealth Fundâ) is a government body responsible for management and administration of
assets of a Middle Eastern country, as entrusted to it by that countryâs Minister of Finance.
The Middle Eastern Sovereign Wealth Fund is wholly owned by that country and was created

 

' The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondentâs Offer of Settlement and are not binding on any other
person or entity in this or any other proceeding.
to perform the function of generating revenue for it. The Minister of Finance serves as
Chairman of the Middle Eastern Sovereign Wealth Fundâs Board of Directors and its most
senior members are political appointees. The Middle Eastern Sovereign Wealth Fund
generally hires external managers to make day-to-day investment decisions concerning its
assets.

7. European Office (the âEuropean Officeâ) is the Middle Eastern Sovereign
Wealth Fundâs office in Europe. The European Office is responsible for managing a portion
of the assets entrusted to the Middle Eastern Sovereign Wealth Fund. Unlike the Middle
Eastern Sovereign Wealth Fund, its parent, the European Office generally uses its own in-
house investment professionals to actively manage assets for which it is responsible.

8. Officials X and Y are government officials affiliated with the Middle Eastern
Sovereign Wealth Fund. Official X was a senior official with the Middle Eastern Sovereign
Wealth Fund during the relevant time period. Official Y was a senior official at the European
Office during the relevant time period.

9, Interns A, B and C (collectively, the âInternsâ) are relatives of Officials X
and Y. Interns A and B are the son and nephew, respectively, of Official X. Intern C is the
son of Official Y. All three Interns were recent college graduates during the relevant time
period.

BNY Mellonâs Business with the Middle Eastern Sovereign Wealth Fund

10. During the relevant time period, BNY Mellonâs business in the EMEA region
collected fees for services provided to the Middle Eastern Sovereign Wealth Fund. Those
fees arose from government contracts awarded to BNY Mellon through a process requiring
approval from certain foreign government officials, and also from additional assets allocated
to BNY Mellon under existing contracts at the discretion of certain foreign government
officials.

11. The Middle Eastern Sovereign Wealth Fund first became a client of BNYM
Asset Servicing in 2000, when the European Office awarded to BNY Mellon custody of
certain assets. Since then, BNY Mellon has earned regular fees for the safekeeping and
administration of Middle Eastern Sovereign Wealth Fund assets. According to the terms of
the custody agreement, these fees are subject to increase from time to time as the European
Office allocates additional assets to BNY Mellon. While the total amount of Middle Eastern
Sovereign Wealth Fund assets under custody by BNY Mellon has varied over time, during
the relevant time period BNY Mellon held Middle Eastern Sovereign Wealth Fund assets
totaling approximately $55 billion.

12. BNY Mellon entered an additional agreement with the European Office in
2003 permitting BNYM Asset Servicing to loan out certain of the Middle Eastern Sovereign
Wealth Fund assets under custody within set guidelines, which varied over time.â This

 

* Such âsecurities lendingâ generally involves loaning a stock, derivative or other security to an individual
investor or firm. It is frequently done as part of a âshort sellingâ strategy on the part of the borrower, who
hopes to profit by immediately selling the security and then buying it back later at a lower price.

3
securities lending arrangement significantly increased BNY Mellonâs revenues from its
dealings with the Middle Eastern Sovereign Wealth Fund. In 2010 and 2011, BNYM Asset
Servicing repeatedly sought to modify the lending guidelines, which had been significantly
restricted following the 2008 economic crash, in order to bring the guidelines back to pre-
2008 levels and further grow the securities lending business with the Middle Eastern
Sovereign Wealth Fund. During the relevant time period, BNYM Asset Servicing sought to
increase the amount of assets under custody from the European Office.

13. In 2009, the Middle Eastern Sovereign Wealth Fund became a client of
BNYM Asset Management when the fund entered into an investment management agreement
designating the Boutique to manage assets worth approximately $711 million (the âBoutique
mandateâ). The bulk of the assets under the investment management agreement were funded
in November 2009, with an additional portion transferring to BNY Mellon in June 2010.
Official X was BNYM Asset Managementâs principal point of contact in connection with the
Boutique mandate. According to the terms of the agreement, the amount of assets under
management was subject to change, as the Middle Eastern Sovereign Wealth Fund could
allocate additional assets to the Boutique mandate at any time. In June 2010, the Middle
Eastern Sovereign Wealth Fund transferred an additional $689,000 to BNY Mellon under the
Boutique mandate. During the relevant time period, BNY Mellon sought to increase the
amount of its Middle Eastern Sovereign Wealth Fund assets under management.

The Internships

14. Officials X and Y requested that BNY Mellon provide their family members
with valuable internships. Officials X and Y made numerous follow-up requests about the
status, timing and other details of the internships for their relatives after the internships had
been offered, and delivering the internships as requested was seen by certain relevant BNY
Mellon employees as a way to influence the officialsâ decisions.

15. In February 2010, at the conclusion of a business meeting, Official X made a
personal and discreet request that BNY Mellon provide internships to two of his relatives:
his son, Intern A, and nephew, Intern B. As a Middle Eastern Sovereign Wealth Fund
department head, Official X had authority over allocations of new assets to existing managers
such as the Boutique, and was viewed within BNY Mellon as a âkey decision makerâ at the
Middle Eastern Sovereign Wealth Fund. Official X later persistently inquired of BNY
Mellon employees concerning the status of his internship request, asking whether and when
BNY Mellon would deliver the internships. At one point, Official X said to his primary
contact at BNY Mellon that the request represented an âopportunityâ for BNY Mellon, and
that the official could secure internships for his family members from a competitor of BNY
Mellon if it did not satisfy his personal request. The same BNY Mellon employee later wrote
toa BNY Mellon colleague that Official X had become âangryâ because BNY Mellon was
experiencing delays in delivering the internships, and had openly questioned the employeeâs
job performance and professionalism because of the delays.

16. As reflected in contemporaneous e-mails and other documents, BNY Mellon
delivered the valuable internship sought by Official X in order to assist BNY Mellon in
obtaining or retaining business. For example:

4
e A Boutique account manager wrote in a February 2010 e-mail concerning the
internship request for Interns A and B that BNY Mellon was ânot in a position to
reject the request from a commercial point of viewâ even though it was a âpersonal
requestâ from Official X. The employee stated: âby not allowing the internships to
take place, we potentially jeopardize our mandate with [the Middle Eastern Sovereign
Wealth Fund].â

e In June 2010, an employee of BNY Mellon with primary responsibility for the Asset
Management relationship with the Middle Eastern Sovereign Wealth Fund wrote of
the internships for Interns A and B: âI want more money for this. I expect more for
this... . Weâre doing [Official X] a favor.â

e Ina separate e-mail to a different BNY Mellon colleague, the same employee stated
âT am working on an expensive âfavorâ for [Official X] â an internship for his son and
cousin (donât mention to him as this is not official).â

e The same employee advised a colleague in human resources: â[W]e have to be
careful about this. This is more of a personal request . . . [Official X] doesnât want
[the Middle Eastern Sovereign Wealth Fund] to know about it.â The same employee
later directed his administrative assistant to refrain from sending e-mail
correspondence concerning Official Xâs internship request âbecause it was a personal
favor.â

After granting Official Xâs request to hire Interns A and B, BNY Mellon retained the
Boutique mandate, and further assets were transferred to BNY Mellon by Official Xâs
department within a few months.

17. In February 2010, around the same time that Official X made his initial
internship request, Official Y asked through a subordinate European Office employee that
BNY Mellon provide an internship to the officialâs son, Intern C. As a senior official at the
European Office, Official Y had authority to make decisions directly impacting BNY
Mellonâs business. Internal BNY Mellon documents reflected Official Yâs importance in this
regard, stating that Official Y was âcrucial to both retaining and gaining new businessâ for
BNY Mellon. One or more European Office employees acting on Official Yâs behalf later
inquired repeatedly about the status and details of the internship, including during discussions
of the transfer of European Office assets to BNY Mellon. At the time of Official Yâs initial
request, a number of recent client service issues had threatened to weaken the relationship
between BNY Mellon and the European Office.

18. The BNY Mellon employee with primary responsibility for managing the
custody relationship with the European Office viewed Official Yâs request as important to
assist BNYM Asset Servicing in obtaining or retaining business. For example:

e The BNY Mellon custody relationship manager explained to more senior officers
within BNY Mellon that granting Official Yâs request was likely to âinfluence any
future decisions taken within [the Middle Eastern Sovereign Wealth Fund].â

5
e The same BNY Mellon relationship manager expressed to colleagues his concern that
one of BNY Mellonâs competitors would agree to hire Intern C if BNY Mellon would
not, and that BNY Mellon might lose market share to the competitor as a result.

e The relationship manager wrote: âIts [sic] silly things like this that help influence
who ends up with more assets / retaining dominant position.â

e The relationship manager separately wrote that meeting Official Yâs requests was the
âonly wayâ to increase BNY Mellonâs share of business from the European Office,
aside from obtaining assets in new countries.

After granting Official Yâs request to hire his son, Intern C, BNY Mellon retained its existing
custody and securities lending business from the European Office, which continued to grow.

19. During the relevant time period, BNY Mellon had an established summer
internship program for undergraduates as well as a separate summer program for
postgraduates actively pursuing a Master of Business Administration (MBA) or similar
degree. Admission to the BNY Mellon postgraduate internship program was highly
competitive and characterized by stringent hiring standards. To recruit postgraduates, BNY
Mellon had relationships with a small number of the most highly selective schools in the
United States and the United Kingdom from which it sourced candidates. Successful
applicants had to achieve a minimum grade point average, and had to advance through
multiple rounds of interviews in addition to having relevant prior work experience and a
demonstrated affinity for and interest in financial services work. BNY Mellon also placed an
emphasis on relevant leadership experience.

20. The Interns did not meet these rigorous criteria and BNY Mellon did not
evaluate or hire the Interns through its established internship programs. For example, as
recent graduates not enrolled in any degree program, the Interns did not meet the basic
entrance standard fora BNY Mellon postgraduate internship. Further, contrary to BNY
Mellonâs goal of converting student interns to full-time hires, the Interns were to return to the
Middle East at the conclusion of their internship and BNY Mellon had no plan to hire them as
full-time employees. Nor did the individual Interns have the requisite academic or
professional credentials for its existing internship programs.

21. Though they did not meet the criteria of BNY Mellonâs existing internship
programs, BNY Mellon hired Interns A, B and C. Contrary to its standard practice, BNY
Mellon decided to hire the Interns before even meeting or interviewing them. Indeed, the
special âwork experiencesâ sought by Officials X and Y were not regular undergraduate or
graduate summer internships at all, but customized one-of-a-kind training programs. The
internships were valuable work experience, and the requesting officials derived significant
personal value in being able to confer this benefit on their family members. As requested by
Officials X and Y, BNY Mellon designed customized work experiences for the Interns.
These bespoke internships were rotational in nature, meaning that Interns A, B and C had the
opportunity to work in a number of different BNY Mellon business units, enhancing the
value of the work experience beyond that normally provided to BNY Mellon interns. Interns

6
A and B were placed in Boston, Massachusetts and were employed by BNY Mellon from
August 6, 2010 through February 25, 2011. Intern C was onboarded and placed in London,
England and interned with BNY Mellon from July 4, 2010 through December 17, 2010.
These approximately six-month internships were significantly longer than the work
experiences typically afforded to BNY Mellon interns through the normal summer internship
program.

22. The internships were neither inexpensive nor easy for BNY Mellon to
structure. BNY Mellon determined, because Interns A and B had already graduated from
college, that Interns A and B should be paid above the normal salary scale for BNY Mellon
undergraduate interns but below the scale for postgraduate interns. Intern C was unpaid.
BNY Mellon also coordinated obtaining visas for all three of the Interns so that they could
travel from the Middle East to work in the countries in which they were placed. BNY Mellon
paid the legal fees and filing costs related to the visas. As the BNY Mellon Asset
Management employee responsible for arranging two of the three internships wrote in a
contemporaneous e-mail, the internships constituted an âexpensive favorâ for the requesting
foreign official.

23. BNY Mellon hired all three of the Interns, with the knowledge and approval
of senior BNY Mellon employees:

e According to the BNY Mellon Asset Management employee with primary
responsibility for arranging the internships for Interns A and B, he had
initially struggled to deliver the internships as requested by Official X until
the internships had the âblessingâ of a senior BNY Mellon employee, after
which âit started to move.â The senior employee facilitated the internships by
contacting human resources on behalf of the Interns, forwarding their resumes
and stating that he âwould like us to support.â

e The BNY Mellon relationship manager with lead responsibility for arranging
the internship for Intern C sent an e-mail to two senior BNYM Asset
Servicing officers describing Official Yâs request and seeking their âsupportâ
for the internship. The same relationship manager later wrote to BNY Mellon
colleagues seeking assistance in arranging the internship and stating â[p|lease
know that this request has the backing of both [senior officers].â

e In October 2010, Official Y made a further request that BNY Mellon modify
the custom internship it had created for Intern C so that he could rotate
through an additional BNY Mellon business unit. This request was also
granted with the knowledge and approval of senior BNY Mellon employees.

24. The Interns were less than exemplary employees. On at least one occasion,
Interns A and B were confronted by a BNY Mellon human resources employee concerning
their repeated absences from work. A Boutique portfolio manager who worked with Intern C
observed that his performance was âokayâ and that âhe wasnât actually as hardworking as I
would have hoped.â Despite these issues, BNY Mellon accommodated the Interns in order to
favorably influence Officials X and Y.
BNY Mellonâs FCPA-Related Policies, Training and Internal Controls

25. During the relevant time period, BNY Mellon had a code of conduct, as well
as a specific FCPA policy, which prohibited BNY Mellon employees from violating the
statute. While BNY Mellonâs policies stated that âany money ... gift... or anything of
valueâ provided to a foreign official might constitute a bribe, employees were provided with
little additional guidance that was tailored to the types of risks related to hiring faced by BNY
Mellonâs international asset servicing unit and asset management business division.

26. During the relevant time period, BNY Mellon provided training on
employeesâ obligations under the FCPA and BNY Mellonâs policies, but did not ensure that
all employees took the training or understood BNY Mellonâs policies.

27. During the relevant time period, BNY Mellon had few specific controls
relating to the hiring of customers and relatives of customers, including foreign government
officials. Sales staff and client relationship managers were permitted wide discretion in
making initial hiring decisions and human resources was not trained to flag hires that were
potentially problematic. Senior managers were able to approve hires requested by foreign
officials with no mechanism to ensure that potential hiring violations were reviewed by
anyone with a legal or compliance background. BNY Mellonâs system of internal
accounting controls was insufficiently tailored to the corruption risks inherent in the hiring
of client referrals, and therefore inadequate to fully effectuate BNY Mellonâs policy against
bribery of foreign officials.

Legal Standar n
FCPA Violation

28. Under Section 21C(a) of the Exchange Act, the Commission may impose a
cease-and-desist order upon any person who is violating, has violated, or is about to violate
any provision of the Exchange Act or any regulation thereunder, and upon any other person
that is, was, or would be a cause of the violation, due to an act or omission the person knew
or should have known would contribute to such violation.

29. Section 30A of the Exchange Act prohibits any issuer with a class of
securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act, or any officer, director,
employee, or agent acting on behalf of such issuer, in order to obtain or retain business, from
corruptly giving or authorizing the giving of, anything of value to any foreign official for the
purposes of influencing the official or inducing the official to act in violation of his or her
lawful duties, or to secure any improper advantage, or to induce a foreign official to use his
influence with a foreign governmental instrumentality to influence any act or decision of
such government or instrumentality. [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78dd-1].

30. Under Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act issuers are required to
devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide
reasonable assurances that (1) transactions are executed in accordance with managementâs
general or specific authorization; (11) transactions are recorded as necessary (I) to permit

8
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles or any other criteria applicable to such statements, and (II) to maintain
accountability for assets; (111) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with
managementâs general or specific authorization; and (iv) the recorded accountability for
assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is
taken with respect to any differences. [15 U.S.C Â§ 78m(b)(2)(B)].

31. As described above, BNY Mellon violated Section 30A of the Exchange Act
by corruptly providing valuable internships to relatives of foreign officials from the Middle
Eastern Sovereign Wealth Fund in order to assist BNY Mellon in retaining and obtaining
business. BNY Mellon also violated Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, by failing to
devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide
reasonable assurances that its employees were not bribing foreign officials.

Commission Consideration of BNY Mellonâs Cooperation and
Remedial Efforts

32. In determining to accept the Offer, the Commission considered cooperation
BNY Mellon afforded to the Commission staff and the remedial acts undertaken by BNY
Mellon. Prior to the investigation by the Commission of the Interns, BNY Mellon had
begun a process of enhancing its anti-corruption compliance program including: making
changes to the Anti-Corruption Policy to explicitly address the hiring of government
officialsâ relatives; requiring that every application for a full-time hire or an internship
be routed through a centralized HR application process; enhancing its Code of Conduct
to require that every year each employee certifies that he or she is not responsible for
hiring through a non-centralized channel; and requiring as part of a centralized
application process that each applicant indicate whether she or a close personal
associate is or has recently been a government official, and, if so, additional review by
BNY Mellonâs anti-corruption office is mandated.

IV.

In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the
sanctions agreed to in Respondentâs Offer.

Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that:

A. Pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, Respondent BNY Mellon cease

B. Respondent shall, within 10 days of the entry of this Order, pay
disgorgement of $8,300,000, prejudgment interest of $1,500,000 and a civil
money penalty in the amount of $5,000,000, for a total payment of
$14,800,000 to the Securities and Exchange Commission for transfer to the
general fund of the United States Treasury, subject to Exchange Act Section
21F(g)(3). If timely payment is not made, additional interest shall accrue

9
pursuant to SEC Rule of Practice 600 and 31 U.S.C. $3717. Payment must

Payments by check or money order must be accompanied by a cover letter
identifying BN'Y Mellon as the Respondent in these proceedings, and the file number of
these proceedings; a copy of the cover letter and check or money order must be sent to
Paul G. Block, Assistant Director, Division of Enforcement, Securities and Exchange
Commission, 33 Arch Street, a3" Fiocor, Boston, MA O2110.

C. Respondent acknowledges that the Commission is not imposing a civil penalty in
excess of $5,000,000 based upon its cooperation in a Commission investigation. If
at any time following the entry of the Order, the Division of Enforcement
(âDivisionâ) obtains information indicating that Respondent knowingly provided
materially false or misleading information or materials to the Commission or in a
related proceeding, the Division may, at its sole discretion and with prior notice to
the Respondent, petition the Commission to reopen this matter and seek an order
directing that the Respondent pay an additional civil penalty. Respondent may
contest by way of defense in any resulting administrative proceeding whether it
knowingly provided materially false or misleading information, but may not: (1)
contest the findings in the Order; or (2) assert any defense to liability or remedy,
including, but not limited to, any statute of limitations defense.

By the Commission.
