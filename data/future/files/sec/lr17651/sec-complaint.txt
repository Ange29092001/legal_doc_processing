_ Civil Action
v. .

DOUGLAS A. MURPHY, DAVID G. KAY,
and LAWRENCE H. THERIOT,
Defendants.

COMPLAINT

Plaintiff, Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission"), alleges as
follows:

NATURE OF THE ACTION

1. This is an action against certain officers and agents of American Rice, Inc.
who violated and aided and abetted violations of the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act by bribing Haitian government officials, by failing to accurately
record those bribes in American Rice's books and records, and by failing to
maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls to prevent or
detect such illegal payments. From January 1998 to October 1999, David G.
Kay, an American Rice vice president, authorized numerous bribery payments
to Haitian customs officials in order to illegally reduce American Rice's import
taxes. The bribery payments assisted American Rice in obtaining or retaining
its business of selling rice to Haitian rice merchants and consumers. American
Rice's president, Douglas A. Murphy, was aware of or recklessly ignored the
bribery payments. American Rice's Caribbean consultant, Lawrence H.
Theriot, knowingly provided substantial assistance to Kay and Murphy by
periodically reporting on the existing bribery arrangements and exploring
alternative schemes. Kay directed American Rice's controller in Haiti to
conceal the bribery payments in American Rice's books and records as a cost
of sales.

2. By in engaging in such conduct, defendant Kay violated Sections 30A and
13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and
Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 promulgated thereunder [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78dd-1 and
78m(b)(5) and 17 C.F.R. Â§ 240.13b2-1] and aided and abetted American Rice's
violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§
78m(b)(2)(A) and (B)].

3. By engaging in such conduct, defendant Murphy directly violated Section
30A of the Exchange Act. Defendant Murphy, as a control person under
Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78t(a)], also is liable for Kay's
violations of Sections 30A and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act
Rule 13b2-1 promulgated thereunder [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78dd-1 and 78m(b)(5) and
17 C.F.R. Â§ 240.13b2-1].

4. Defendant Theriot aided and abetted Kay and Murphy's violations of
Section 30A of the Exchange Act.

5. The defendants will, unless restrained and enjoined, continue to engage in
the acts and practices set forth in this complaint and in acts and practices of
similar purport and object.

6. The acts and practices constituting the violations herein have occurred
within the Southern District of Texas, and elsewhere.

7. The Commission brings this action pursuant to Sections 20(e), 21(d) and 32
of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78t(e), 78u(d) and 78ff] seeking injunctions
and civil monetary penalties against Murphy, Kay and Theriot.

URISDICTION

8. This court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 21(e) and
27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78u(e) and 78aal].

9. The defendants, directly or indirectly, used the means and instrumentalities
of interstate commerce or of the mails in furtherance of the acts alleged
herein.

DEFENDANTS

10. Defendant Douglas A. Murphy was American Rice's president and one of
its directors from 1993 until he was fired on October 4, 1999. At all relevant
times, by virtue of his position in the company and as Kay and Theriot's direct
supervisor, Murphy had actual power and influence over Kay, Theriot and
other American Rice employees. Murphy also had the ability to cause Kay,
Theriot and other employees to engage in the wrongful conduct alleged
herein. Murphy is a U.S. citizen and currently resides in Kingwood, Texas.

11. Defendant David G. Kay was American Rice's vice president of Caribbean
operations and reported directly to Murphy at all relevant times. American
Rice terminated Kay's employment in January 2002. Kay is a U.S. citizen and
currently resides in or around Houston, Texas.

12. Defendant Lawrence H. Theriot was American Rice's Caribbean operations
consultant from 1989 until he resigned in October 1999. Theriot reported
directly to Murphy and Kay. Theriot is a U.S. citizen and currently resides in
Reston, Virginia.

OTHER RELEVANT PERSONS AND ENTITIES

13. American Rice, Inc. is a Texas corporation with its principal place of
business in Houston, Texas. At all relevant times, American Rice was an
"issuer" as that term is defined in Section 3(a)(8) of the Exchange Act [15
U.S.C. Â§ 78c(a)(8)] with a class of securities registered with the Commission
pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78Ag)]. American
Rice processed and marketed rice in international and domestic markets
under a variety of brand names.

14. On August 11, 1998, American Rice filed a voluntary petition for
reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. On
October 1, 1999, pursuant to the company's confirmed Plan of
Reorganization, American Rice cancelled all of its existing classes of preferred
and common stock, and issued new common stock to its Bondholder creditors
without registration. The stockholders of American Rice prior to October 1,
1999, did not retain or receive any equity interest in the reorganized
company.

15. Rice Corporation of Haiti, S.A. ("RCH"), was a Haitian corporation with its
principal place of business in and around Port-au-Prince, Haiti. RCH leased a
rice mill and packaging plant in Laffiteau, Haiti. RCH processed, packaged and
marketed rice for American Rice in Haiti under an at-will service agreement.
American Rice treated RCH as a wholly owned subsidiary and included the
operations of RCH in its consolidated financial statements.

16. Joseph Schwartz, Jr. was American Rice's controller in Haiti. At all relevant
times, Schwartz supervised the financial activities of American Rice in Haiti.
Schwartz reported to Kay and other American Rice employees. Schwartz
currently resides in Houston, Texas.

17. Allen Sturdivant was a manager at American Rice's Houston shipping
office. At all relevant times, Sturdivant supervised the preparation of
American Rice's shipping documents for rice shipments to Haiti. Sturdivant
reported to Kay. Sturdivant currently resides in Houston, Texas.

18. Joel Malebranche was an employee of American Rice in Haiti. At all
relevant times, Malebranche was responsible for facilitating the prompt
clearance of American Rice shipments through Haitian customs. Malebranche
reported to Kay. Malebranche resides in Haiti and Jamaica, New York.

COMMON ALLEGATIONS
American Rice's Haitian Operations

19. In 1992, RCH leased a rice mill and packaging plant in Laffiteau, Haiti.
American Rice provided the necessary capital to renovate the facility and
commence operations. Under the terms of an at-will service agreement, RCH
processed, packaged and marketed rice in Haiti for American Rice. American
Rice retained ownership of its rice and the proceeds from the sale of its rice.
American Rice also paid the import taxes on its shipments of rice to Haiti.
Employees of American Rice, including Schwartz and Malebranche, lived and
worked at the RCH facilities in Haiti.

American Rice's Competition in Haiti

20. American Rice competed with several large importers and a host of small
importers for a share of the rice market in and around Port-au-Prince, Haiti. In
the mid-1990s, American Rice captured a large share of that rice market
because it was able to sell its rice at very competitive prices. American Rice
had a built-in price advantage because it finished and bagged its rice in Haiti.
By shipping bulk rice, instead of bagged rice, American Rice paid a lower
import tax rate and operated more efficiently than its competitors.
21. However, competition from rice smugglers, who paid no import taxes,
corruption among customs officials, who allegedly cut improper deals with
other competitors, and escalating import taxes eventually eroded American
Rice's competitive price advantage.

American Rice Employees Bribed Haitian Customs Officials

22. In January 1998, American Rice employees and agents in Haiti entered
into an illicit arrangement with certain Haitian government officials in Port-au-
Prince to enable American Rice to retain its business in Haiti. In exchange for
bribery payments, the customs officials permitted American Rice to declare
less than the full tonnage of rice it shipped to Haiti. By declaring less than the
full tonnage of rice on at least 12 rice shipments to Haiti during 1998 and
1999, American Rice avoided paying import taxes on thousands of metric tons
of rice. American Rice employees made the bribes because they believed that
the tax reductions were essential to American Rice being able to continue to
conduct business in Haiti. In any event, the bribes were designed to result in
cost reductions that would enable American Rice to maintain or increase the
volume of rice it sold in Haiti. The bribery payments, therefore, were made in
order to assist American Rice in obtaining or retaining its business of selling
rice to Haitian rice merchants and consumers.

23. In January 1998, Kay authorized the first bribery payment to Haitian
customs officials in furtherance of the bribery scheme. On January 2, 1998,
American Rice shipped 8,039 metric tons of bulk rice to Haiti on the
company's ocean-going barge, LaurieKristie. In connection with the January
shipment, Kay instructed Sturdivant to prepare a fake set of shipping records.
The fake set of shipping records listed only 6,218 metric tons of rice.
Sturdivant sent an accurate set of shipping records and a fake set of shipping
records to Malebranche in Haiti prior to the arrival of the vessel.

24. Malebranche gave the shipping records to American Rice's customs broker
in Haiti. The customs broker presented the fake set of shipping records to
Haitian customs officials. Haitian customs officials calculated American Rice's
import taxes based on 6,218 metric tons of bulk rice instead of 8,039 metric
tons. At or about the same time, Malebranche, at Kay's direction, negotiated
the amount of the bribe with the customs officials directly or through an
intermediary. The amount negotiated was $25,000.

25. After the LaurieKristie cleared customs, Kay authorized the $25,000
bribery payment. Kay directed Schwartz to write a check payable to cash from
American Rice's Citibank Haiti checking account in the amount of $25,000.
Schwartz wrote the check and handed it to Malebranche. Malebranche or one
of his associates cashed the check and passed the $25,000 in cash to an
intermediary. Kay, Schwartz and Malebranche believed the intermediary gave
all or a part of the money to Haitian customs officials.

26. As a result of the bribery scheme, American Rice saved approximately
$82,000 in import taxes on the January 1998 rice shipment. On January 20,
1998, Kay sent an e-mail to Schwartz and Theriot to confirm the savings. Kay
wrote that import taxes on the actual tonnage of rice would have been
$406,275, but American Rice paid only $323,435. According to Kay:

Savings is therefore: $ 82,839 USD
Less Commissions: $(25,000) USD
Net Savings: $ 57,839 USD

Kay twice instructed Schwartz to discuss the e-mail with Malebranche and
then "destroy this message!"

27. Kay continued to authorize bribery payments in connection with at least
11 subsequent rice shipments to Haiti from February 1998 to September
1999. The bribery scheme remained essentially the same for each shipment
of rice, except the amount of the bribe and the percentage of undeclared rice
increased over time. Murphy was aware of the bribery payments. The bribery
payments did not stop until American Rice fired Murphy in October 1999.

28. The following chart summarizes each of American Rice's 16 rice
shipments to Haiti from January 1998 to September 1999, the amount of
undeclared rice per shipment in metric tons, the amount of import tax savings
per shipment in U.S. dollars, the amount of the bribery payment, and the net
savings obtained by American Rice:

Schwartz and Kay Hid the Bribery Payments

29. Schwartz concealed each of the bribery payments by falsely recording
them as a cost of sales in the books and records of American Rice's Haitian
Division. Schwartz prepared periodic financial statements for the Haitian
Division that incorporated the false entries. Kay reviewed the periodic
financial statements prepared by Schwartz. Kay knew that the financial
statements incorporated false entries, but Kay did not direct Schwartz to
accurately record the bribery payments. American Rice subsequently
incorporated the false entries in the Haitian Division's financial statements
into its consolidated financial statements.

Theriot Provided Substantial Assistance to Murphy and Kay

30. Theriot provided substantial assistance to Murphy and Kay by periodically
reporting on the existing bribery arrangements, exploring alternative
schemes, and assessing each of the participants. He was the "eyes and ears"
of management in Haiti.

31. On or about January 1998, Theriot secured Murphy's authorization to
explore alternative customs arrangements. Theriot required Murphy's
intervention because Kay was concerned that Theriot's efforts might
jeopardize the company's existing bribery arrangement. On March 17, 1998,
Theriot sent a detailed memo to Kay regarding his progress. In that March 17
memo, Theriot told Kay that he broke off negotiations for an alternative
customs arrangement because his contacts requested a "reduced quantity
document." Theriot, therefore, concluded that his alternative was no different
than the existing bribery scheme.

32. Theriot also summarized the roles of the participants in connection with
the first two bribery payments under the existing scheme. He told Kay:

[I]n the first boat, Joe [Schwartz] delivered a check made to cash
for $25,000 to Joel [Malebranche] who was in the office with
Fritz [Richardson, American Rice's customs broker]. . . . Joel said
he handed the cash to Mario's [a customs official] emissaries in
the sales office and watched through the window as they
delivered the cash to Mario who was waiting in a car in front of
the office.

Theriot advised Kay to be careful in selecting who makes the bribery
payments. "[T]he issue of who makes payments is always critical since only
that person knows how much is actually transferred to the next level contact."

33. At Murphy's direction, Theriot devoted an entire memo to the subject of
American Rice intermediaries in 1998. Theriot defined "intermediary" as "the
person who has ongoing direct contact with the operators inside the sleazy,
corrupt business environment of Haiti." Theriot told Kay and Murphy:

[O]ver time LHT [Theriot], operating as a "white hat guy,"
concentrated on the public PR effort [to eliminate smuggling].
Joel [Malebranche], working directly with DGK [Kay], was
developed as an "inside" guy to handle what became the
company's most important "gray" operation inside customs.

ok OK

As a Haitian-American, with ethics sensitized by his lengthy stay
in the USA, Joel understands and worries constantly about the
risks of operating in the gray areas. As a Haitian national, he has
become disgusted with his growing insider knowledge of the
Sleaze involved in the network of Haitians at and around Customs.
When we first discussed survival techniques required at Customs,
| recall Joel's obvious personal sense of shock at the size of the $
numbers involved.

34. Theriot continued to provide guidance to Murphy and Kay until he
resigned as an American Rice consultant shortly after Murphy was fired.

Murphy Knew About the Bribery Scheme
35. By virtue of his position in the company and frequent communications
with Kay and Theriot, Murphy knew about or recklessly ignored the bribery
scheme in 1998 and 1999.

36. In 1998 and 1999, Murphy became increasingly involved in the day-to-day
business operations in Haiti. He traveled to Haiti frequently. On those visits,
he met with American Rice employees and others, including Theriot and Kay.
Murphy also received numerous memos and other communications from
Theriot alluding to the bribery scheme. Nevertheless, Murphy did not conduct
any investigation, demand an explanation or prohibit his employees and
agents from participating in improper activities.

American Rice Agents Made other Improper Payments

37. In 1998, RCH had tax problems. The company was required to file monthly
tax reports with DGI, the Haitian tax authorities, reflecting its monthly sales
activity. However, rice sales figures exceeded the amount of rice reflected in
documents filed with customs. DGI also claimed that RCH owed back
corporate income taxes on American Rice's sales, not merely on RCH's
services fees from American Rice. Theriot and others negotiated a deal with
two DGI employees to facilitate the filing of understated sales figures, to avoid
an audit of those figures, and to forgive a portion of the back taxes in
exchange for one or more payments of approximately $2,500 U.S. dollars.
Murphy directly authorized at least one of those payments in September
1999.
