SEC Charges California Telecommunications Company
With FCPA Violations

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2010-115

Washington, D.C., June 29, 2010 â The Securities and Exchange Commission
today filed a settled federal court action against San Jose, Calif.-based
telecommunications company Veraz Networks, Inc., alleging that Veraz
violated the books and records and internal controls provisions of the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). The alleged violations stemmed from improper
payments made by Veraz to foreign officials in China and Vietnam after the
company went public in 2007.

The SEC alleges that Veraz engaged a consultant in China who in 2007 and
2008 gave gifts and offered improper payment together valued at
approximately $40,000 to officials at a government controlled
telecommunications company in China in an attempt to win business for
Veraz. A Veraz supervisor who approved the gifts described them in an
internal Veraz email as the "gift scheme." Similarly in 2007 and 2008, the SEC
alleges that a Veraz employee made improper payments to the CEO of a
government controlled telecommunications company in Vietnam to win
business for Veraz.

"It is particularly important that newly public companies doing business
overseas establish the appropriate policies and procedures to prevent a
culture of payment to foreign officials from developing," said Marc J. Fagel,
Regional Director of the Commission's San Francisco Regional Office.

According to the SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of California, Veraz violated the books and records and internal
controls provisions of the FCPA by failing to accurately record the improper
payments on its books and records, and failing to devise and maintain a
system of effective internal controls to prevent such payments. Veraz, without
admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission's complaint,
consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining Veraz from
future violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and ordering Veraz to pay a penalty of $300,000.

This case was investigated by Monique C. Winkler, Robert S. Leach, and Cary
Robnett of the San Francisco Regional Office.

The Commission would like to thank the U.S. Department of Homeland
Security for its assistance in this matter.
