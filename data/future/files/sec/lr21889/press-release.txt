Securities and Exchange Commission v. INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS
MACHINES CORPORATION, Civil Action No. 01:11-cv-00563 (RJL)
(D.D.C.) (filed March 18, 2011)

IBM TO PAY $10 MILLION IN SETTLED FCPA ENFORCEMENT ACTION

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission today charged International
Business Machines Corporation (âIBMâ) with violating the books and records
and internal control provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977
(âFCPAâ) as a result of the provision of improper cash payments, gifts, and
travel and entertainment to government officials in South Korea and China.

As alleged in the SECâs Complaint, from 1998 to 2003, employees of IBM
Korea, Inc., an IBM subsidiary, and LG IBM PC Co., Ltd., a joint venture in
which IBM held a majority interest, paid cash bribes and provided improper
gifts and payments of travel and entertainment expenses to various
government officials in South Korea in order to secure the sale of IBM
products.

It was further alleged that, from at least 2004 to early 2009, employees of
IBM (China) Investment Company Limited and IBM Global Services (China)
Co., Ltd., both wholly-owned IBM subsidiaries, engaged in a widespread
practice of providing overseas trips, entertainment, and improper gifts to
Chinese government officials.

Without admitting or denying the SECâs allegations, IBM consented to the
entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins the company from
violating the books and records and internal control provisions of the FCPA,
codified as Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934. IBM also agreed to pay disgorgement of $5,300,000, $2,700,000
in prejudgment interest, and a $2,000,000 civil penalty.
