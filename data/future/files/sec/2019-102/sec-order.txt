Summary

1. This matter concerns violations of the books and records and internal accounting
controls provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (ââFCPAâ) by Walmart, a global retailer.
From in or around July 2000 through in or around April 2011, Walmartâs subsidiaries in Brazil,
China, India, and Mexico operated without a system of sufficient anti-corruption related internal
accounting controls. As a result, during this time period, those Walmart subsidiaries paid certain
third-party intermediaries (âTPIsâ) without reasonable assurances that certain transactions were
consistent with their stated purpose or consistent with the prohibition against making improper
payments to government officials. Additionally, during this time period, when Walmart learned of
certain anti-corruption risks, the Company did not either sufficiently investigate the allegations or
sufficiently mitigate the known risks.

FACTS

Background

21. At the end of Walmartâs fiscal year 1990, the Company had 1,528 stores which had
generated annual sales of $26 billionâall within the United States. Walmart, recognizing that
international expansion could help it become the worldâs largest retailer, entered its first foreign
market, Mexico, in 1991. In 1993, Walmart established Walmart International as an operating
segment, headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas, responsible for overseeing the Companyâs
operations outside the United States. Between 1994 and 1996, the Company established additional
outposts in other countries, including Brazil and China. During fiscal year 2010, the year in which
Walmart opened its first Indian wholesale outlet, the Company operated stores in 14 foreign
countries, with international sales of approximately $100 billion.

22. | Walmartâs formula for success centered on Everyday Low Prices and Everyday
Low Cost. Walmartâs rapid international growth, combined with its low-cost philosophy,
contributed to the Companyâs insufficient anti-corruption related internal accounting controls in
Walmartâs subsidiaries in Mexico, India, China, and Brazil from in or around July 2000 until in or
around April 2011.

Early Corruption Warnings

23. In or around 2002 and 2003, Walmart received a request for FCPA training from
China Subsidiary and also a request for a detailed FCPA policy covering TPIs and joint venture
partners for China Subsidiary. Walmart did not immediately provide widespread anti-corruption

3
training to China Subsidiary or implement TPI and joint venture anti-corruption policies at China
Subsidiary.

24. In or around June 2003, China Subsidiary identified a potentially troubling
historical payment made by a certain China Subsidiary joint venture. In 1999 or 2000, the joint
venture had entered into an agreement to pay RMB 500,000 (approximately $60,000) to the
landlord of a China Subsidiary store for government relationship consulting services and various
permits. The permit costs should have likely been nominal but China Subsidiary did not further
inquire into the matter at the time.

25. In or around October 2003, China Subsidiaryâs internal audit team analyzed gifts
with an average dollar value of less than $20 given to Chinese government officials by China
Subsidiary corporate affairs employees and small amounts of cash provided to other Chinese
officials for travel and meal expenses related to business meetings by the Chinese partner of a
China Subsidiary joint venture. China Subsidiaryâs internal audit team observed that these
transactions appeared to be inconsistent with corporate policy. China Subsidiaryâs internal audit
team also observed that certain China Subsidiary anti-corruption related internal accounting
controls had weaknesses. In response, Walmart did not promptly implement all of China
Subsidiary internal auditâs suggested remedial actions.

Walmartâs First Anti-Corruption Compliance Program

26. In or around 2001, Walmartâs anti-corruption policy consisted of a paragraph in the
Companyâs Statement of Ethics. The paragraph summarized the FCPAâs prohibitions and
described the statuteâs facilitating payment exception and the procedure for making such payments.
In or around July 2002, Walmart planned to implement a worldwide comprehensive anti-
corruption compliance and training program within a few months. In or around 2003, Walmart
prepared draft anti-corruption compliance materials. However, nearly a year passed before the
Company took additional steps to revise the proposed anti-corruption compliance program.

27. Walmart published its International Anti-Corruption Policy and Procedures on or
around March 21, 2005, and distributed them to the Companyâs foreign markets. In or around
November 2005, the implementation of Walmartâs anti-corruption compliance program was
formally put on hold until further notice.

Mexico

28. On or around September 21, 2005, Mexico Subsidiary Lawyer A, who had been
separated from Mexico Subsidiary over a year earlier, wrote an email to Walmart Lawyer. In the
email, Mexico Subsidiary Lawyer A stated that he was responsible for many real estate projects in
Mexico from 1975 through 2004 and wrote, â[I]f youâre interested to know confidential details
about the way we achieved 300 projects...contact me and in that case, I would ask you do it before
you contact [Mexico Subsidiary] because the kind of issues (for instance, we used to undercover
expenses identified with a code known and authorized by the highest levels).â

29. Walmart retained Outside Lawyer to advise the Company in response to Mexico
Subsidiary Lawyer Aâs allegations. During the first half of October 2005, Outside Lawyer
interviewed Mexico Subsidiary Lawyer A twice. Mexico Subsidiary Lawyer A alleged that during

4
his last six to seven years at Mexico Subsidiary, Mexico Subsidiary had very aggressive growth
goals that required new stores to open in record time. He further alleged that Mexico Subsidiary
frequently employed TPIs, known as gestores, who in some cases made improper payments to
Mexican government officials to obtain licenses, permits, and other approvals for certain store
projects in Mexico. He also detailed several projects where he claimed Mexico Subsidiary made
improper payments to obtain licenses, permits, and other approvals.

30. Mexico Subsidiary Lawyer A alleged the scheme worked in the following manner:

a. Mexico Subsidiary would determine which government officials
needed to receive an improper payment to obtain a permit or license.
Mexico Subsidiary Lawyer A would then tell one of the gestores
which official to make an improper payment to and then obtained
checks from Mexico Subsidiary payable to the gestores.

b. The gestores cashed the checks and delivered the agreed-upon
improper payments.

C. Occasionally, the officials preferred to deal only with Mexico
Subsidiary Lawyer A. In those instances, according to Mexico
Subsidiary Lawyer A, the gestores provided cash to Mexico
Subsidiary Lawyer A who made the improper payments himself.

d. Mexico Subsidiary Lawyer A and Mexico Subsidiary Executive B
developed a system of three-digit codes, or claves, which were typed
or handwritten on the gestoresâ invoices and tracked the improper
benefits obtained by Mexico Subsidiary.

e. The clave descriptions included: âavoidance or omission of
requirement;â âinfluence, control, or knowledge of privileged
information in the head of the governmental office;â and âpayments

to eliminate fines.â

f. Mexico Subsidiary Lawyer A claimed that Mexico Subsidiary
Executive A, Mexico Subsidiary Internal Auditor, and Mexico
Subsidiary Lawyer Bâwho had been named Mexico Subsidiaryâs
compliance officer after Mexico Subsidiary Lawyer A left Mexico
Subsidiaryâalso participated in the scheme.

31. Mexico Subsidiaryâs use of real estate gestores stopped after Mexico Subsidiary
Lawyer A was separated from the Company in or around August 2004 and before Walmartâs 2005
investigation into the gestores allegations.

32. Walmart retained a law firm to initially advise the Company regarding Mexico
Subsidiary Lawyer Aâs allegations and decided to use internal audit and corporate investigations
employees to conduct an investigation in Mexico. In mid-November 2005, these âpreliminary
inquiryâ teams spent two weeks in Mexico investigating the allegations. While there, they
identified a draft March 2004 Mexico Subsidiary internal audit review of gestoria payments that

5
had not previously been shared with Walmart internal audit executives and employees in the
United States. The final report that was sent to Walmart in December 2004 omitted references,
contained in earlier versions, to MXN $45.6 million (approximately USD $4 million) paid to one
of the gestores that Mexico Subsidiary Lawyer A alleged was corrupt. While the draft report stated
that the transactions reviewed were reasonably appropriate, complied with documentation and
classification standards, and were compliant with local policies, legislation and generally accepted
accounting principles, it also described âunusualâ and âfacilitatingâ payments made in connection
with Mexico Subsidiaryâs use of gestores. The final report provided to Walmart in December 2004
had also omitted these references to suspicious transactions.

33. In or around November 2005, a Mexico Subsidiary employee explained to
investigators that when problems arose when obtaining licenses, Mexico Subsidiary typically
negotiated a payment with the relevant official to resolve the problem. The same employee,
although unsure whether improper payments were made to government officials, said that Mexico
Subsidiary utilized gestores to âsmooth out the roadâ so that âthere would not be any bumps during
the request for a license.â The employee also conceded that it was unusual that Mexico Subsidiary
paid the gestores when most of the payments were supported by only one invoice and that no
records showed what work they did, with whom they met, or how many hours they worked.

34. In or around December 2005, Walmart Investigator circulated a report concerning
the Mexico Subsidiary allegations that stated that laws had been potentially violated, and
recommended several additional investigative steps.

35. Walmart internal audit produced its own report one week later, which indicated that
the work performed constituted only a preliminary review of the gestoria payments and that the
auditors were unable to determine how the gestores used the funds received from Mexico
Subsidiary. The report also made several recommendations for investigative next steps.

36. Walmart did not follow the investigatorsâ proposed action plans. On or around
February 7, 2006, Walmart tasked Mexico Subsidiary Lawyer B with leading the remainder of the
investigation.

37. In March 2006, Mexico Subsidiary Lawyer B prepared his investigative report,
which concluded that the corruption allegations were unsubstantiated. However, it did
acknowledge that certain of Mexico Subsidiaryâs anti-corruption related internal accounting
controls were deficient and, although some improvements had been made, certain additional anti-
corruption related internal accounting controls were recommended. Walmart did not address those
recommendations by implementing sufficient anti-corruption related internal accounting controls
until in or around April 2011.

38. Another corruption risk identified was Mexico Subsidiaryâs practice of donations in
the form of checks, cash, and merchandise to Mexican municipalities and local government
entities. In some instances, the donations were made around the time Mexico Subsidiary obtained
permits and licenses or other government approvals. Some of the goods donated, such as cars and
computers, were capable of being converted to personal use. Mexico Subsidiary did not implement
sufficient internal accounting controls regarding the use of donations until in or around April 2011.
China

39. Between in or around 2006 to in or around early 2011, China Subsidiaryâs internal
audit team identified certain weaknesses in anti-corruption related internal accounting controls. In
January 2006, it observed: China Subsidiaryâs draft anti-corruption policy and procedures were
inconsistent with the policy adopted by Walmart in or around March 2005; China Subsidiaryâs
policy excluded employees of state-owned and state-controlled enterprises from the definition of
âgovernment official;â and formal anti-corruption training at China Subsidiary had not yet been
provided and most Chinese managers were unfamiliar with the FCPA and misunderstood the
concept of facilitating payments. Other anti-corruption related internal accounting controls
weaknesses at China Subsidiary observed by China Subsidiary internal audit included lack of TPI
retention procedures and lack of a charitable donation policy. Although internal audit raised
recurring issues during this time period, China Subsidiaryâs anti-corruption related internal
accounting controls were not improved until in or around April 2011.

India

AO. In or around late 2006, Walmart conducted a review of India Partner. The initial
due diligence, while generally positive, raised certain anti-corruption red flags about doing
business in India. One report stated that Walmart would âbe targeted by corrupt individuals and
organizations seeking bribes or kickbacks in exchange for favorable business relationships or the
easing of bureaucratic restrictions.â The report also said that corruption would likely cause
Walmart âdelays in the processing of permits, licenses and other paperwork.â The report suggested
that Walmart could mitigate its corruption risk with â[s]trict adherenceâ to the FCPA and by
establishing âstrong internal controls and management oversight.â

41. In or around November 2006, prior to the formation of India Joint Venture, a
Walmart real estate employee wrote to Walmart Executive that he had received a âwink and nodâ
when he âbrought up transparency and clean transactions relative to the FCPAâ with an employee
of India Partner. The India Partner employee also admitted that âspeed paymentsâ were used in the
past by India Partner. Walmart did not sufficiently address the Walmart real estate employeeâs
warning prior to forming India Joint Venture.

42. Because of certain anti-corruption related red flags, Walmart obtained additional
due diligence reports and reviewed their results.

43. Walmart entered the Indian market in partnership with India Partner. Due to foreign
direct investment restrictions, Walmart proposed that retail operations initially be franchised to
India Partner with a wholesale business structured as a joint venture majority owned by Walmart.
In or around August 2007, Walmart and India Partner executed franchise and joint venture
agreements. Walmart tasked its partner with obtaining all licenses, permits, certifications, and
zoning for retail stores in India.

44. Between in or around March 2009 and in or around January 2011, Walmartâs
internal audit team in India conducted at least three reviews of India Subsidiary and India Joint
Venture. All of those reviews identified certain weaknesses in anti-corruption related internal
accounting controls that required remediation, which were not immediately addressed. During this

7
time period, Walmart continued to rely on India Partner for permitting, licensing, and real estate
matters for retail stores in India.

45. In or around July 23, 2011, an anonymous source sent an email to certain Walmart
executives alleging several issues. According to the anonymous email, an employee of India Joint
Venture and an employee of India Retail Business were involved in a scheme to make improper
payments to government officials to obtain store operating permits and licenses, and that a senior
legal employee of India Joint Venture knew about the scheme. Although one executive requested
that Walmart investigators examine the allegations, Walmart did not conduct an inquiry at that
time.

46. Despite the audit reports discussing control deficiencies and the anonymous email
alleging improper payments to government officials, Walmart did not begin to implement and
maintain a system of sufficient internal accounting controls related to anti-corruption to address
corruption concerns in India until in or around April 2011.

47. Because of Walmartâs failure to implement sufficient internal accounting controls
related to anti-corruption, from in or about 2009 through in or about at least 2011, India Joint
Venture and India Retail Business were able to retain TPIs that made improper payments to
government officials in order to obtain store operating permits and licenses during that period.
These improper payments were then recorded in India Joint Ventureâs books and records with

vague descriptions like âmisc fees,â âmiscellaneous,â âprofessional fees,â âincidental,â and
âgovernment fee.â
Brazil
As. Despite certain observations from Brazil Subsidiary internal audit regarding the

Brazil Subsidiary anti-corruption related internal accounting controls weaknesses, Brazil
Subsidiary continued to retain certain high-risk TPIs. Starting in or around 2008 to in or around
April 2012, Brazil Subsidiary employed Brazil Construction Firm to build or renovate eight stores
and obtain all required construction permits. Although certain Brazil Subsidiary employees were
aware of the Brazil Construction Firmâs reputation for corruption, no due diligence was conducted
until in or around 2009, a year after Brazil Construction Firm was engaged. That due diligence
review cited allegations that Brazil Construction Firm had made improper payments to Brazilian
officials for non-Walmart projects and engaged in other illegal acts for non-Walmart projects.
Citing these allegations, the report recommended that Brazil Subsidiary not renew Brazil
Construction Firmâs contract. Notwithstanding the due diligence results, Walmart continued to use
Brazil Construction Firm until in or around April 2012.

49. One of the Brazil Subsidiary projects that Brazil Construction Firm worked on was
the construction of a new Walmart store that was originally scheduled to open on or around
November 19, 2009. Brazil Subsidiary tasked Brazil Construction Firm with obtaining the
construction permit and with handling all aspects of the storeâs construction in May 2009. Later,
because Brazil Construction Firm was unable to timely obtain all permits, the grand opening was
delayed until mid-December. On or around December 7, 2009, Brazil Subsidiaryâs real estate
committee met and discussed the store project, which was on the committeeâs agenda due to its
missing operating license. At the meeting, a Brazil Subsidiary executive stated that the store

8
needed an âextraordinary processâ to obtain the license. That same day, certain members of Brazil
Subsidiary management approved hiring another TPIâindirectly through Brazil Construction
Firmâto secure the license. Nine days later, the TPI obtained all governmental approvals for the
store. The TPI received approximately $127,000, an amount greater than Brazil Subsidiaryâs other
permitting consultants, for the TPIâs efforts with these permits and certain operating permits
obtained after the store opened.

50. Certain Brazil Subsidiary employees expressed their concerns regarding the TPI to
Brazil Subsidiary management prior to the TPIâs engagement. Their concerns included the
possibility that the TPI was a government official and that the TPI did not have a formal
corporation to accept payment. A former employee of Brazil Construction Firm later stated that the
TPI told him at that time that when the TPI was working on obtaining the construction permit
under the direction of Brazil Construction Firm, 1) the TPI needed cash which the TPI had
requested from Brazil Construction Firm and had received from the former employee; and 2) the
TPI stated the money was for âpeople I have to pay,â which the former employee stated he
understood to mean would be used to provide improper payments to Brazilian government
officials. That former Brazil Construction Firm employee later stated that he made improper
payments himself, without the knowledge of Brazil Subsidiary, in connection with two other Brazil
Subsidiary stores.

51. In or around 2010, Brazil Subsidiary planned to open two other stores in the same
area. As with the earlier project, Brazil Subsidiary engaged the same TPI at year-end to assist with
stores that had been delayed due to licensing problems. The TPI again commanded an unusually
high fee for the TPIâs servicesâapproximately $400,000âand was paid indirectly through Brazil
Subsidiaryâs contractor. Despite earlier corruption concerns, no due diligence was conducted on
the TPI prior to the TPIâs work. The TPIâs ability to obtain licenses and permits quickly earned the
TPI the nickname âsorceressâ or âgenieâ within Brazil Subsidiary.

Walmartâs Subsequent Anti-Corruption Compliance Programs

52. Although certain Walmart executives discussed revising the anti-corruption policy
and procedures shortly after their publication in March 2005, the Company did not announce the
launch of a ânew and enhancedâ anti-corruption program until on or around February 8, 2007. The
program would feature a revised policy, new procedures, and improved auditing and investigative
protocolsâwith an emphasis on training and TPI due diligence. Its rollout was scheduled to begin
two months later and conclude in or around 2008.

53. Walmart published the revised anti-corruption program as Company policy on or
around December 12, 2008. However, this policy was not sufficiently implemented at that time.
Shortly thereafter, Walmart appointed Walmart Compliance Employee as the Companyâs first vice
president of international compliance and tasked him with updating the anti-corruption compliance
program.

54. In or around April 2009, Walmart informed its foreign subsidiaries that it would
soon promulgate anti-corruption standards that would be more flexible and easier and quicker to
implement. Instead of taking a centralized approach, each country would be required to devise its
own program based on the standards. On or around June 11, 2009, Walmart circulated to the

9
subsidiaries a one-page document entitled Global Anti-Corruption Standards that: 1) summarized
the FCPA; 2) acknowledged that in certain instances Walmart may provide gifts, meals, travel, and
entertainment to government officials; 3) noted that the standards applied to TPIs; and 4) provided
contact information for the Companyâs global ethics office. The markets were instructed to design
and implement risk-based internal accounting controls, procedures, and training to ensure the
standards were met.

55. Walmartâs fiscal year 2010 FCPA reviews in Brazil, India, and Mexico identified
certain of its anti-corruption related internal accounting controls had weaknesses in each
subsidiary.

56. By around April 2011, Walmart recognized that its existing anti-corruption
compliance program was not sufficient and hired an international law firm and an international
consulting firm to conduct a worldwide anti-corruption compliance review for the purpose of
reviewing and testing Walmartâs anti-corruption compliance program in various foreign
subsidiaries around the world, including in Mexico, India, Brazil, and China.

10
Walmartâs Disclosures, Cooperation, and Remediation

60. In determining to accept the Offer, the Commission considered Walmartâs
disclosures, cooperation, and remedial efforts.

61. Walmart made an initial self-disclosure of the potential FCPA violations in Mexico
to the Commissionâs staff in November 2011, after it retained outside counsel to conduct an
internal investigation under the direction of the Audit Committee of Walmartâs Board of Directors.
Subsequently, Walmart voluntarily expanded its investigation and disclosed its findings concerning
Brazil, China, and India to the Commission staff, although such disclosure was after the
Commission staff had already begun investigating the Company related to conduct in Mexico.

62. Walmart further cooperated by identifying issues and facts that would likely be of
interest to the Commission and the staff and providing regular updates to the staff; making regular
factual presentations to the staff and sharing information that would not have been otherwise
readily available to the staff; making foreign-based employees available for interviews in the
United States; producing translations of relevant documents; and obtaining cooperation of former
employees and third parties, including their consent to interviews.

63. Walmartâs remedial measures include: (1) hiring a Global Chief Ethics &
Compliance Officer , an International Chief Ethics & Compliance Officer, and a dedicated Global
Anti-Corruption Officer, with separate reporting lines to the Audit Committee of Walmartâs Board
of Directors; (2) adding dedicated regional and market Chief Ethics & Compliance Officers,
foreign market anti-corruption directors, and anti-corruption compliance personnel at Walmartâs
home office and in Walmartâs foreign markets; (3) conducting, across each of Walmartâs markets,
enhanced monthly and quarterly anti-corruption monitoring; (4) enhancing on-site global anti-
corruption audits to test adherence to enhanced anti-corruption related internal accounting controls
and procedures; (5) enhancing anti-corruption related internal accounting controls on the selection
and use of third parties; (6) enhancing global anti-corruption training and awareness programs; (7)
implementing an automated global license management system for obtaining and renewing
licenses and permits and a global donation management system, which enhances controls relating
to charitable donations; and (8) terminating business relationships with third parties involved in the
conduct at issue.
