COMPLAINT

Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (the âCommissionââ) alleges that:
SUMMARY

1. This case centers upon Bobby Bentonâs violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act (âFCPAâ) while serving as Vice President, Western Hemisphere Operations for
Pride International, Inc. (âPrideâ), one of the worldâs largest offshore drilling companies.

2. From approximately 2003 to 2005, another Pride employee, the manager of the
Venezuelan branch of a French subsidiary of Pride, authorized payments totaling approximately
$384,000 to third-party companies believing that all or a portion of the funds would be given to
an official of Venezuelaâs state-owned oil company in order to secure extensions of three drilling
contracts. Benton, in an effort to conceal the bribes from Prideâs internal and external auditors,
redacted references to the Venezuelan payments in an action plan responding to an internal audit
report.

3. In or about late 2004, Benton authorized the payment of $10,000 to a third party,

believing that all or a portion of the funds would be given by the third party to a Mexican
customs official in return for favorable treatment by the official regarding certain customs
deficiencies identified during a customs inspection of a Pride supply boat.

4. Also in or about late 2004, Benton learned that a customs agent engaged by
Prideâs Mexican subsidiaries paid approximately $15,000 to a Mexican customs official to
ensure that the export of a rig would not be delayed due to customs violations.

5. Despite his knowledge, and in one instance authorization, of the Venezuelan and
Mexican bribes, Benton signed two false certifications in connection with audits and reviews of
Prideâs financial statements denying any knowledge of bribery.

6. By engaging in the conduct described in this Complaint, Benton violated Sections
13(b)(5) and 30A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ) [15 U.S.C. 8Â§
78m(b)(5) and 78dd-1] and Exchange Act Rules 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 [17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 240.13b2-1
and 240.13b2-2] and aided and abetted violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B), and 30A
of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78m(b)(2)(A), 78m(b)(2)(B), and 78dd-1].

7. The Commission brings this action against Benton seeking a civil penalty,
disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and injunctive relief to prevent future violations of the
federal securities laws.

JURISDICTION

8. This Court has jurisdiction over this action under Sections 21(d), 21(e), and 27 of
the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§8Â§ 78u(d), 78u(e), and 78aa]. In connection with the conduct
described herein, Benton, directly or indirectly, made use of means or instrumentalities of
interstate commerce, of mails, or of facilities of a national securities exchange in connection with

the transactions, practices, and courses of business alleged in this Complaint.

SEC v. Benton Page 2
Complaint
9. Venue in the Southern District of Texas is proper pursuant to Section 27 of the
Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. Â§ 78aa] because certain acts or transactions constituting the violations
by Benton occurred in this district.

DEFENDANT AND OTHER ENTITIES

10. Defendant Benton is a U.S. citizen and resident of Houston, Texas, and was, at all
relevant times, an officer and employee of Pride. Benton joined Pride as an Operations Manager
for the Eastern Hemisphere in 2001 when Pride acquired Marine Drilling. Benton later served as
Vice President, Western Hemisphere Operations until he separated from Pride in December
2006. Benton was responsible for, among other things, ensuring that Pride conducted its
Western Hemisphere operations in compliance with the FCPA, that adequate controls were in
place to prevent illegal payments, and that the companyâs books and records were accurate.
When subpoenaed to testify by the Commissionâs staff during its investigation, Benton asserted
his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.

11. Pride is a Delaware corporation headquartered in Houston, Texas. Its common
stock is registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and trades on the New York Stock
Exchange.

12. Pride Forasol S.A.S. (âPride Forasolââ) is organized and has its principal place of
business in France. Pride Forasol was acquired by Pride in 1997. As relevant to the conduct
alleged, Pride Forasol operated through Pride Foramer de Venezuela S.A., a branch of Pride
Forasolâs wholly owned subsidiary Pride Foramer S.A.S., which operated in Venezuela

(hereinafter âPride Foramer Venezuelaâ).

13. Mexico Drilling Limited LLC, Pride Central America LLC, and Pride Drilling
LLC were wholly owned subsidiaries of Pride that were formed in Delaware and operated in
Mexico (hereinafter collectively âPride Mexicoâ).

14. At all times relevant to this Complaint, the financial results of the entities
referenced in paragraphs 12 and 13 were consolidated into the financial results for Pride.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND
Payments to Extend Contracts in Venezuela

15. In early 2003, a Pride Foramer rig operated in Venezuela on a drilling contract
with the Venezuelan state-owned oil company, Petrdleos de Venezuela S.A. (âPDVSAâ), that
was coming up for renewal or termination in February 2003.

16. In or around February 2003, an individual purporting to represent a PDVSA
official (the âVenezuela Intermediaryâ) told Pride Foramer Venezuelaâs country manager (the
âVenezuela Country Managerâ) that the PDVSA official could assist the company in obtaining
an extension of the drilling contract in exchange for a payment of $60,000 per month for each
month that the contract was extended.

17. PDVSA extended the drilling contract from April 2003 to mid-July 2003. In or
around mid-2003, the Venezuela Country Manager authorized payments totaling approximately
$120,000, through certain vendors of Pride Foramer Venezuela, to a Miami bank account in the
name of the Venezuela Intermediary, believing that all or a portion of the funds would be given
to the PDVSA official.

18. In or around April 2004, a Pride Foramer Venezuela operations employee
believed that the same PDVSA official was blocking or planned to block contract extensions for

two rig management contracts with PDVSA, at least in part because Pride Foramer Venezuela

SEC v. Benton Page 4
Complaint
had refused to make a third payment of $60,000 for the 2003 drilling contract extension. In or
around May 2004, the Venezuela Country Manager authorized additional payments to the
Venezuela Intermediary of $60,000 in connection with the 2003 drilling contract extension and
$12,000 per rig, per month for each month that the rig management contracts were extended,
believing that all or a portion of the funds would be given by the Venezuela Intermediary to the
PDVSA official.

19. From approximately mid-2004 to the end of 2004, Pride Foramer Venezuela made
the payments to the Venezuela Intermediary through certain of its local vendors. In or around
December 2004, Pride retained a marketing agent in Venezuela (the âVenezuela Agentâ). From
in or around January 2005 to in or around June 2005, Pride Foramer Venezuela made the
payments to the Venezuela Intermediary through the Venezuela Agent. Pride Foramer
Venezuela recorded the payments referenced above either as payments for goods and services
received from the vendors or as marketing commission payments to the Venezuela Agent.

20. In or around February 2005, a new Pride Foramer Venezuela country manager
prepared a draft action plan addressing internal control weaknesses uncovered by a Pride internal
audit relating to vendor practices in Venezuela. The draft action plan contained information
about the vendorsâ involvement in making payments for the benefit of the PDVSA official in
connection with extensions for the 2003 drilling contract and the rig management contracts. The
manager forwarded the draft document via e-mail to Benton on or about February 12, 2005.
Benton, in turn, redacted all references to the Venezuelan bribes and attached his âcleaned upâ
version to an e-mail he sent to the new Venezuela country manager on or about February 14,
2005. On or about February 16, 2005, Benton, in response to comments from a Pride internal

auditor regarding Bentonâs revised action plan, advised the new Venezuela country manager:

SEC v. Benton Page 5
Complaint
âAs you continue to improve the Venezuela Vender [sic] Review audit, use the attached version
to update. All other draft versions should be deleted.â Bentonâs e-mail also confirmed that his
revised action plan was the version submitted to Prideâs internal and external auditors.

Payments to Customs Officials in Mexico

21. On or about December 13, 2004, Mexican customs officials inspected port
facilities leased by Pride Mexico. During the inspection, the officials clatmed that there were
customs violations related to the importation status of certain equipment on board a Pride
Mexico supply boat.

22. After the inspection, a Pride Mexico manager reported to Benton that a Mexican
customs official had solicited a payment of $10,000 for what the official stated was lenient
treatment by customs officials related to the claimed violations found during the inspection. On
or about December 15, 2004, Benton authorized a payment of $10,000 to the customs official.

23. In or around December 2004, a representative of Pride Mexico paid $10,000 in
cash to a person purportedly representing a customs official. Pride Mexicoâs books and records
falsely documented the improper payment as an electricity maintenance expense.

24. Also in or around December 2004, a Pride Mexico manager learned that a
customs agent engaged by Pride Mexico to manage the export of a mat-supported jackup rig
from Mexico (the âMexico Customs Agentâ) informed certain Pride Mexico logistics employees
that he had made a payment of approximately $15,000 to a Mexican customs official during the
course of the export to ensure that the export of the rig would not be delayed due to claimed
violations related to non-conforming equipment on board the rig.

25. The Mexico Customs Agent submitted invoices to Pride Mexico, seeking

payment for âextra workâ performed during the export. Pride Mexico paid the invoices and,

SEC v. Benton Page 6
Complaint
Case 4:09-cv-03963 Document1 Filed in TXSD on 12/11/09 Page 7 of 11

notwithstanding the statements of the Mexico Customs Agent, falsely recorded all the payments
to the Mexico Customs Agent in its local books as payments for customs agency services.

26. Benton, on or about December 21, 2004, received an e-mail from the Pride
Mexico manager detailing the facts surrounding the bribe and stating, âNow we need to find out
a way to justify the extra payment to customs.â Despite his knowledge of the bribe, Benton did
not inform Prideâs management, legal department, or internal auditors of the matter and allowed
the false record to remain in Pride Mexicoâs books and records.

False Representations to Accountants

27. Benton, an officer of Pride, on or about March 3, 2005 and May 5, 2006, signed
false certifications in connection with the companyâs 2004 and 2005 annual reports. The March
3, 2005 certificationâexecuted less than three weeks after Benton redacted all references to
bribery from the internal audit action planâtrepresented that he knew of no bribes paid to
government officials to obtain or retain business. Bentonâs May 5, 2006 certification also stated
that he was not aware of any bribes or other violations of the FCPA. Both certifications were
false due to Bentonâs knowledge, and in one instance authorization, of the Venezuelan and
Mexican bribes described above. But for Bentonâs false statements, Prideâs management and
internal and external auditors would have discovered the bribery schemes and the corresponding
false books and records.
