IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
DISTRICT OF SOUTH CAROLINA
GREENVILLE DIVISION

Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, Civil Action No. 6:20-cv-00786-DCC
South Carolina Department of Consumer
Affairs, and the State of Arkansas ex rel.
Leslie Rutledge, Attorney General,
STIPULATED FINAL JUDGMENT
Plaintiffs, AND ORDER

V.

Candy Kern, Howard Sutter HI, and
Upstate Law Group LLC,

Defendants.

 

 

Plaintiffs, the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau), the South Carolina
Department of Consumer Affairs (Department), and the State of Arkansas ex rel. Leslie
Rutledge, Attorney General (Arkansas) (Plaintiffs) commenced this civil action on February 20,
2020, to obtain injunctive and monetary relief and civil penalties from Candy Kern, Howard
Sutter II, and Upstate Law Group LLC (Defendants). The Complaint alleges violations of the
Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA), 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531, 5536(a), 5564, 5565, in
connection with Defendantsâ provision of substantial assistance to the brokering of contracts
offering high-interest credit to consumers, including (1) misrepresenting to consumers that the
contracts are valid and enforceable when, in fact, the contracts are void from inception because
federal law prohibits agreements under which another person acquires the right to receive a
veteranâs pension payments, 38 U.S.C. Â§ 5301(a)(3)(C), and because South Carolina law, which
governs the contracts, prohibits sales of unpaid earnings and prohibits assignments of pensions as

security on payment of a debt, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 37-3-403; (2) misrepresenting to consumers that
6:20-cv-00786-DCC Date Filed 01/21/21 Entry Number 52 Page 2 of 15

the offered product is a sale of payments and not a high-interest credit offer; (3) failing to inform
consumers of the applicable interest rate on the credit offer, (4) representing to consumers that
consumers may be subject to criminal prosecution if they breached their contracts, and (5)
representing, expressly or impliedly, that consumers are legally obligated to make payments in
accordance with the terms of their contracts when, in fact, the contracts were void from inception
and consumers are not obligated to make payments. The Complaint also alleges violations of the
South Carolina Consumer Protection Code, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 37-5-108 (SCCPC), for
unconscionable debt collection.

Plaintiffs and Defendants consent to entry of this Stipulated Final Judgment and Order
(Order), without adjudication of any issue of fact or law, to settle and resolve all matters in
dispute between these parties arising from the conduct alleged in the Complaint.

FINDINGS

1. This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this action because it is brought
under â[f]ederal consumer financial law,â 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5565(a)(1), presents a federal question, 28
U.S.C. Â§ 1331, and is brought by an agency of the United States, 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1345.

2. This Court has supplemental jurisdiction over the Departmentâs state-law claims
because they are so related to the federal claims that they form part of the same case or
controversy. 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1367(a).

3. This Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendants because they are located,
reside, or do business in this district. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5564(f).
