enforce its rights to any payment or monetary judgment under this Order, such as a
nondischargeability complaint in any bankruptcy case.

29. The facts alleged in the Complaint establish all elements necessary to sustain an
action by the Bureau under Â§ 523(a)(2)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. Â§ 523(a)(2)(A),
and for such purposes this Order will have collateral estoppel effect against each Defendant,

Defendant may not argue that Defendant ts entitled to, nor may Defendant benefit by, any
offset or reduction of any monetary remedies imposed in the Related Consumer Action
because of the civil money penalty paid in this action or because of any payment that the
Bureau makes from the Civil Penalty Fund. If the court in any Related Consumer Action
offsets or otherwise reduces the amount of compensatory monetary remedies tmposed
against Defendant based on the civil money penalty paid in this action or based on any
payment that the Bureau makes from the Civil Penalty Fund, Defendant must, within 30
days after entry of a final order granting such offset or reduction, notify the Bureau and pay
the amount of the offset or reduction to the U.S. Treasury. Such a payment will not be
considered an additional civil money penalty and will not change the amount of the civil

money penalty imposed in this action.
