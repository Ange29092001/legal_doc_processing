In the Matter of: CONSENT ORDER

SMART Payment Plan, LLC

 

 

The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau) has reviewed certain
acts and practices of SMART Payment Plan, LLC (Respondent, as defined below)
regarding its marketing for a Payment Accelerator Program (the SMART Plan) and
has identified the following violations of the Consumer Financial Protection Act, Â§

103 1(a) and 1036(a)(1)(B); 12 U.S.C. 88 5531(a), 5536(a)(1)(B):

1. Respondent falsely claimed in its individualized benefits disclosures that the
SMART Plan would cause consumers to save money on their auto loans. By
failing to disclose that its fees would ordinarily exceed the interest savings,
Respondent created the misleading impression that consumers would save money
using its product. Instead, most of Respondentâs consumers lost money by paying

more in fees to participate than the SMART Plan delivered in interest savings.
2. Under Sections 1053 and 1055 of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of

2010 (CFPA), 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5563, 5565, the Bureau issues this Consent Order

(Consent Order).

consented to the issuance of this Consent Order by the Bureau under sections 1053
and 1055 of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5563 and 5565, without admitting or denying

IV
Bureau Findings and Conclusions

The Bureau finds the following:
6. Respondent is a limited liability company organized in Texas with its
principal place of business in Austin, Texas. At all times material to this complaint,
Respondent has collected and transmitted consumer funds from consumers to their
lenders or servicers, activity that constitutes a consumer financial product or
service covered by the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5481(5), (15)(A)(v). Respondent is
both a âcovered personâ and âservice providerâ as those terms are defined by 12
U.S.C. 8Â§ 5481(6) and (26).
7. Respondent offers a single consumer financial product or service, the

SMART Plan.
8. Respondent markets the SMART Plan as a program that purports to allow
consumers to pay off loans faster and more cheaply by making automatic partial
payments that match their paydays with bi-weekly payments instead of monthly
payments.

9. Because there are 52 weeks in a year, consumers enrolled in the bi-weekly
program make 26 half payments to SMART each year, resulting in the equivalent
of making 13 monthly payments or one full extra payment to Respondent each
year.

10. Respondent holds the consumersâ extra payments and uses the first extra
payment or payments to pay itself all or part of a membership fee.

11. During the Relevant Period that fee was $399.

12. Additionally, during the Relevant Period, Respondent charged consumers a
$1.95 per bi-weekly debit fee.

13. Respondent markets the SMART Plan to consumers almost exclusively

through automobile dealers.

14. During the Relevant Period, Respondent enrolled over 180,000 consumers
into the SMART Plan. Tens of thousands of these consumers paid the full

enrollment fee on an interest-bearing loan.
Findings and Conclusions as to Respondentâs Misrepresentations Regarding
the SMART Planâs Benefits

15. During the Relevant Period, Respondent provided car dealerships with
integrated software that was used to enroll consumers in the SMART Plan.

16. The software generates customized disclosure forms called the âBenefits
Summary.â

17. During the Relevant Period, for the purpose of inducing consumers to enroll
in the SMART Plan, Respondent stated in each consumerâs Benefits Summary a
specific amount of interest savings the consumer would purportedly achieve by
enrolling in the SMART Plan.

18. Respondent failed to disclose that the fees to achieve this purported savings
would ordinarily exceed the interest savings, resulting in most consumers losing
money by enrolling in the SMART Plan.

19. In other Benefits Summaries, Respondent represented to consumers that they
would receive specific dollar savings amounts that it called the âAccelerated
Payment Advantage,â which refers to the reduced loan balance at a particular time
in the loan schedule.

20. But Respondent failed to disclose to consumers that they would actually
have to pay more than the Accelerated Payment Advantage amount to achieve this

reduction in balance.
21. During the Relevant Period, none of Respondentâs disclosures informed
consumers of the total cost or net cost of the SMART Plan even though the same
software that calculated its other representations was capable of calculating
individual consumersâ costs.

22. Respondent marketed the SMART Plan as a financial benefit to consumers,
however, Respondent was aware that during the Relevant Period the vast majority
of its consumers ended up paying more in total on their loans by enrolling in the
SMART Plan.

23. Additionally, most of Respondentâs consumers dropped out of the SMART
Plan before the end of their loan term, resulting in them not receiving even the
misleading benefit amounts promised by Respondent.

24. Section 1036(a)(1)(B) of the CFPA prohibits âunfair, deceptive, or abusiveâ
acts or practices. 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(B).

25. Respondentâs representations, as described in Paragraphs 15â22 constitute
deceptive acts or practices in violation of sections 1031(a) and 1036(a)(1)(B) of the

CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).

subject to Section VII of this Consent Order.

1]
30. Based on financial statements and supporting documentation that
Respondents submitted to the Bureau and Respondentâs inability to pay the entire

39. Under section 1055(c) of the CFPA, 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5565(c), by reason of the
violations of law described in Section IV of this Consent Order, and taking into
account the factors in 12 U.S.C. Â§ 5565(c)(3), Respondent must pay a civil money
penalty of $1 to the Bureau.

benefit for any civil money penalty paid under this Consent Order; or
b. Seek or accept, directly or indirectly, reimbursement or indemnification

penalty paid in this action. If the court in any Related Consumer Action offsets or
otherwise reduces the amount of compensatory monetary remedies imposed

Consent Order.

in a Related Consumer Action, Respondent must notify the Enforcement Director
of the final judgment, consent order, or settlement in writing. That notification
