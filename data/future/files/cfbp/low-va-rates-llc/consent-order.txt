Low VA Ratesâ mortgage advertisements are advertisements for âclosed-end
credit,â as that term is defined in Regulation Z. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.2(a)(10).
Low VA Rates offers consumer mortgages, including mortgages guaranteed
by the VA.

Low VA Ratesâ principal means of advertising VA-guaranteed mortgages is
through direct-mail advertisements sent to consumers, including veterans
and servicemembers.

Since January 2016, Low VA Rates has mailed millions of mortgage
advertisements to consumers in 48 states and the District of Columbia.
Hundreds of thousands of consumers have received at least one of Low VA
Ratesâ direct-mail advertisements, and tens of thousands of consumers have

obtained mortgages through Low VA Rates.

False, Misleading, and Inaccurate Representations
Federal consumer financial law contains numerous provisions banning the
use of misleading and deceptive statements in mortgage advertisements.
Despite those prohibitions, Low VA Rates was responsible for both the
content of, and the dissemination of, numerous mortgage advertisements
during the Relevant Period that contained false, misleading, or inaccurate

statements, as described below.

False, Misleading, and Inaccurate
Representations About Cost and Other Credit Terms

Most of Low VA Ratesâ mortgage advertisements stated specific credit
terms, such as an interest rate, annual percentage rate (APR), payment
amount, index, margin, or closing costs.

By stating specific credit terms in its advertisements, Low VA Rates
represented, expressly or by implication, that it arranged or offered a
mortgage with those credit terms.

In fact, Low VA Rates did not arrange or offer mortgages with the specific
credit terms stated in many of those advertisements.

In numerous instances, Low VA Ratesâ advertisements misrepresented the
actual credit terms applicable to the mortgages that it would arrange or offer.
Numerous Low VA Rates mortgage advertisements described mortgages
with a simple interest rate and APR combination that Low VA Rates was not
actually prepared to arrange or offer.

For example, Low VA Rates sent 573,500 mailers to consumers between
April 28, 2017, and November 24, 2017, that advertised a mortgage with a
simple-interest rate of 2.25% for three years and an APR of 3.196%.

In fact, the advertised APR was incorrect for any loan Low VA Rates was

prepared to arrange or offer.

Accordingly, Low VA Rates misrepresented in these advertisements the
actual APR for loans it was prepared to arrange or offer.

Numerous Low VA Rates mortgage advertisements advertised ââcash outâ
credit terms that Low VA Rates did not actually arrange or offer.

For example, Low VA Rates sent 151,675 mailers to consumers between
September 20, 2017, and January 17, 2018, that advertised âcash outâ credit
terms that Low VA Rates did not actually arrange or offer. The
advertisement stated that the borrower could âtake $20,000 cash-out for only
$87.48 per month!â

In fact, obtaining any cash-out amount against the consumerâs home equity
was possible only if the consumer had an existing mortgage and refinanced
the entire amount owed on that mortgage as part of a cash-out refinance
mortgage, resulting in a total monthly payment larger than $87.48.

For example, Low VA Rates sent 573,500 mailers to consumers between
April 28, 2017, and November 24, 2017, that advertised $15,000 cash out for
a monthly payment of âas little as $65.â

In fact, obtaining any cash-out amount against the consumerâs home equity
would be possible only if the consumer had an existing mortgage and
refinanced the entire amount owed on that mortgage as part of a cash-out

refinance mortgage, resulting in a total monthly payment larger than $65.

Accordingly, Low VA Rates misrepresented in these advertisements the
actual monthly payment for loans it offered or was prepared to arrange.
Numerous Low VA Rates mortgage advertisements used misleading
statements and rhetorical questions to promote unavailable loan terms.

For example, Low VA Rates sent 1,141,690 mailers to consumers between
January 1, 2016, and September 16, 2016, that prominently referred to a
1.75% fixed simple annual interest rate, and were mailed in an envelope that
stated, âPayment Reduction Entitlement Notice.â The mailer used rhetorical
questions to advertise a 1.75% fixed rate: â[D]oes your VA loan have a fixed
rate of over 1.75%?â and âWhy stay at a rate that is higher than 1.75%?â and
âThese low rates canât last long!â

In fact, Low VA Rates was not prepared to arrange or offer a 1.75% fixed
rate, which the mailerâs fine print confirmed: â[w]e do not have fixed
interest rates at 1.75% currently.â

Accordingly, Low VA Rates misrepresented the interest rate for loans
offered or arranged to be offered in these advertisements.

Numerous Low VA Rates mortgage advertisements misrepresented the
payment amount applicable to the advertised loan and the existence, nature,
or amount of cash or credit available to the consumer in connection with the

mortgage.

In another example, Low VA Rates sent 151,675 mailers to consumers
between September 20, 2017, and January 17, 2018, that described a
mortgage with âNO out of pocket costs,â with a rate that required the
purchase of 2.25 to 2.75 discount points.

In fact, the VA permits an Interest Rate Reduction Refinancing Loan
(IRRRL) borrower to finance only two points, 38 C.F.R. Â§ 36.4307(a)(4)(i).
A borrower had to purchase additional points out of pocket to obtain the
advertised rate.

Accordingly, Low VA Rates misrepresented in these advertisements the fees
or costs for loans offered or arranged to be offered.

Numerous Low VA Rates mailers misrepresented the amount of cash
actually available in connection with an advertised mortgage.

For example, Low VA Rates also sent 26,241 mailers to consumers between
January 1, 2016, and April 15, 2016, that promoted a âCASH refund from
current lender.â

In fact, that mailer failed to disclose both that (1) the cash refund would be
limited to the funds in the consumerâs escrow account and (2) the consumer
would be required to fund a new escrow account with Low VA Rates.
Accordingly, Low VA Rates misrepresented in these advertisements the

existence of cash available for loans offered or arranged to be offered.

In another example, Low VA Rates sent 26,241 mailers to consumers
between January 1, 2016 and April 15, 2016 that promoted âYOUR 1 Year
Savingsâ beside an estimated payment on the front of the ad.
In fact, the touted âsavingsâ were not as advertised and resulted from
deferring payments consumers would still ultimately be obligated to make.
Accordingly, Low VA Rates misrepresented in these advertisements the
existence of savings available for loans that it offered or would arrange to
offer.
Consumers who received the advertisements described in Paragraphs 23-51
were likely to be misled by them.
The advertisements were also likely to affect consumersâ conduct or
decisions with regard to obtaining a loan.

False and Misleading Representations

Related to Cost Comparisons

Some Low VA Rates advertisements contained misleading comparisons.
These advertisements misleadingly compared consumersâ actual or
hypothetical payments or rates with payments or simple-annual rates that
would be available under the advertised loan for a period less than the full
term of the loan and did not include a clear and conspicuous comparison to

the information required to be disclosed under Â§ 1026.24(f)(2) and (3), as

12
55.

56.

57.

58.

required by 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(1)(2)(1).

For example, Low VA Rates sent 1,141,690 mailers between January 1,
2016, and September 16, 2016, that promoted a âfixed rate of... 1.75%,â as
well as included a statement that a âbetter interest rate has enabled our
clients to enjoy an Average Savings of--$294.00 / month on their home loans
in 2015, which is over $3,500/ year!â This constituted an implied
comparison between the advertised productâs payment and the consumerâs
current payment.

But the mailer fails to make the clear and conspicuous disclosures required
by Â§ 1026.24(f)(2) and (3).

For example, Low VA Rates sent 151,675 mailers to consumers between
September 20, 2017, and January 17, 2018, that stated that Low VA Rates
could reduce the interest rate on a consumerâs loan with an advertised rate
that was actually only in effect for the first three years of the 30-year loan
period without disclosing that introductory rate period. While the mailer
disclosed the full payment period in fine print on the back, the comparison
was made on the front.

Consumers who received the advertisements described in Paragraphs 54â57

were likely to be misled by them.

59. The advertisements were also likely to affect consumersâ conduct or
decisions with regard to obtaining a loan.

False and Misleading Representations
Related to Debt Elimination, or Reducing or Eliminating Existing Debts

60. Numerous Low VA Rates mailers contained misleading claims of debt
elimination.

61. For example, Low VA Rates sent 40,000 mailers between January 20, 2017,
and February 3, 2017, containing the following statements: â[f]reedom from
debt!â in the âFreedom from Debt Programâ via the âFreedom from Debt
VA Refinance.â An IRRRL or cash-out loan does not eliminate all of a
consumerâs debt but is instead itself a debt and, as a result, cannot be used to
âfreeâ a consumer of debt.

62. Consumers who received the advertisements described in Paragraphs 60-61
were likely to be misled by them.

63. The advertisements were also likely to affect consumersâ conduct or
decisions with regard to obtaining a loan.

Inadequate Disclosures

64. Most of Low VA Ratesâ mortgage advertisements stated a period of

repayment, payment amount, finance charge, or simple annual rate of

interest. Under certain sections of Regulation Z, including Â§ 1026.24(c), (d),

14

and (f), the use of these terms triggers specific disclosure requirements.
Some of the advertisements did not include the other disclosures that are
required, or did not include them in the manner required.

Numerous Low VA Rates advertisements stated the amount of a payment,
but failed to state: (a) the terms of repayment reflecting the consumerâs
repayment obligations over the full term of the loan and (b) the APR.

For example, Low VA Rates sent 151,675 mailers to consumers between
September 20, 2017, and January 17, 2018, that stated a monthly $87.48
payment amount. The mailers did not state the terms of repayment reflecting
the consumerâs repayment obligations over the full term of the loan or the
APR.

Numerous Low VA Rates advertisements stated a simple annual rate of
interest for a loan for which more than one interest rate would apply, but
failed to state an accurate APR for the loan under the accuracy standards set
forth in Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1026.17(c) and 1026.22; and/or failed to
state these terms clearly and conspicuously.

For example, Low VA Rates sent 151,675 mailers to consumers between
September 20, 2017, and January 17, 2018, that prominently displayed a

2.25% introductory rate.

15
69.

70.

71.

72.

73.

74.

75.

The period for the introductory rate and the actual subsequent fully indexed
rate of 3.45% were only disclosed in fine print on the second page.

In another example, Low VA Rates sent advertisements for a variable rate
product described as a â2.25% hybrid (3.196% APRJ) |.â

The advertisement did not disclose the period for the introductory rate or any

subsequent rate for the loan product.

Numerous Low VA Rates mortgage advertisements stated the amount of an
initial payment, but failed to state the amount of each payment that would
apply over the term of the loan; failed to state the period during which each
payment would apply; or failed to state these terms clearly and
conspicuously.

For example, Low VA Rates sent 151,675 mailers to consumers between
September 20, 2017, and January 17, 2018, that promoted a 30-year
variable-rate mortgage with a monthly payment of $573.37.

In fact, this payment was based only on the introductory rate. Low VA Rates
did not disclose each payment and the period for each payment that would
apply over the remaining term of the loan.

In another example, Low VA Rates sent 26,241 mailers to consumers
between January 1, 2016, and April 15, 2016, that disclosed someâbut not

allâmonthly payments clearly and conspicuously.

While the advertisements prominently disclosed initial monthly payments in
large print on the front of the advertisement, the required payment
information was only disclosed in a block of light gray small print on a

second page.

Some Low VA Rates mailers stated a simple annual interest rate more
conspicuously than the APR.

For example, Low VA Rates sent 138,200 mailers to consumers between
September 15, 2017, and November 24, 2017, that prominently mention a
â3%â simple annual interest rate five times, including twice mentioning rates
âbelow 3%.â

The advertisement stated this 3% rate without using the term âannual
percentage rate,â and while an APR is indicated in small print on the back of
the mailer, the statement of a simple annual percentage rate of 3% on the

front of the advertisement is more conspicuous.

VIOLATIONS OF REGULATION Z
Unavailable Credit Terms, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(a)

80. Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(a), â[i]f an advertisement for credit states
specific credit terms, it shall state only those terms that actually are or will
be arranged or offered by the creditor.â

81. Low VA Rates violated Â§ 1026.24(a) because, as described in Paragraphs
23-51, numerous Low VA Rates advertisements for credit stated specific
credit terms other than those terms that actually were or would be arranged

or offered by the creditor.
Interest Rates Other than the APR, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(c)

82. Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(c):

If an advertisement states a rate of finance charge, it shall state
the rate as an âannual percentage rate,â using that term. If the
annual percentage rate may be increased after consummation,
the advertisement shall state that fact.... If an advertisement
is for credit secured by a dwelling, the advertisement shall not
state any other rate [other than the APR], except that a simple
annual rate that is applied to an unpaid balance may be stated
in conjunction with, but not more conspicuously than, the
[APR].

83. Low VA Rates violated Â§ 1026.24(c) because, as described in Paragraphs
77-79, numerous Low VA Rates mortgage advertisements stated a simple

annual interest rate more conspicuously than the APR.

18
84.

85.

86.

Terms of Repayment, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(d)

Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(d)(1), if an advertisement sets forth any of the
four specified triggering terms (the amount or percentage of any
downpayment, the number of payments or period of repayment, the amount
of any payment, or the amount of any finance charge), the advertisement
must also state, among other things, â[t]he terms of repayment, which reflect
the repayment obligations over the full term of the loan, including any
balloon payment.â 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(d)(1), (2)ai).

Low VA Rates violated Â§ 1026.24(d) because, as described in Paragraphs
65-66, numerous Low VA Rates mortgage advertisements set forth the
period of repayment or the amount of any payment, which are triggering
terms under Â§ 1026.24(d)(1)(i1) and (iii), but failed to state the terms of

repayment over the full term of the loan pursuant to Â§ 1026.24(d)(2)(ii).
Inadequate Disclosure of Rates, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(f)(2)(i)

Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(f)(2)(1), if a direct-mail mortgage advertisement:

states a simple annual rate of interest and more than one
simple annual rate of interest will apply over the term of the
advertised loan, the advertisement shall disclose in a clear and
conspicuous manner:

(A) Each simple annual rate of interest that will apply.

In variable-rate transactions, a rate determined by
adding an index and margin shall be disclosed based on

19
a reasonably current index and margin;

(B) The period of time during which each simple
annual rate of interest will apply; and

(C) The [APR] for the loan. If such rate is variable, the

[APR] shall comply with the accuracy standards in
Â§Â§ 1026.17(c) and 1026.22.

87. Low VA Rates violated Â§ 1026.24(f)(2)(1) because, as described in
Paragraphs 67-71, numerous Low VA Rates direct-mail mortgage
advertisements for a loan for which more than one interest rate would apply
stated a simple annual rate of interest, but did not include one or more of the
disclosures required pursuant to Â§ 1026.24(f)(2)(1)(A) through (C), or did not

(C) In an advertisement for credit secured by a first lien on a

Low VA Rates violated Â§ 1026.24(f)(3)(1) because, as described in

Paragraphs 72-76, numerous Low VA Rates direct-mail mortgage

advertisements stated the amount of a payment but did not include one or

more of the disclosures required pursuant to Â§ 1026.24(f)(3)()(A) through

Misleading Cost Comparisons, 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(i)(2)

Under 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1026.24(1)(2), mortgage advertisements may not:

(i)

(il)

In general. The advertisement includes a clear and conspicuous
comparison to the information required to be disclosed under Â§
1026.24(f)(2) and (3); and

Application to variable-rate transactions. If the advertisement is
for a variable-rate transaction, and the advertised payment or
simple annual rate is based on the index and margin that will be
used to make subsequent rate or payment adjustments over the
term of the loan, the advertisement includes an equally
prominent statement in close proximity to the payment or rate
that the payment or rate is subject to adjustment and the time
period when the first adjustment will occur.

âany misleading claim... that the mortgage product offered will eliminate
debt or result in a waiver or forgiveness of a consumerâs existing loan terms

with, or obligations to, another creditor.â

Low VA Rates violated Â§ 1026.24(1)(5) because, as described in Paragraphs

engage in a deceptive act or practice in connection with any transaction with
a consumer for a consumer-financial product or service, or the offering of a
consumer-financial product or service. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).
An act or practice is deceptive if it involves a material misrepresentation or
omission that is likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under the

circumstances.

Information that is likely to affect a consumerâs choice of, or conduct

regarding, a product or service is material to consumers.

Deceptive Representations About Credit Terms

In numerous instances, as described in Paragraphs 23-59, Low VA Ratesâ
mortgage advertisements represented, expressly or by implication, that
specific credit terms were available, would be offered, or arranged to be
offered including representations about specific APRs, payment amounts,
loan periods, available cash or credit, fees, cost comparisons, closing costs,
or the variable or fixed nature of rates or payments, when in fact those
specific credit terms were not available or were not the terms that Low VA
Rates was actually prepared to offer, or arranged to be offered.

Low VA Ratesâ misrepresentations about the availability of the advertised
credit terms of the advertised mortgage were likely to mislead consumers
acting reasonably under the circumstances.

Low VA Ratesâ misrepresentations about the credit terms of the advertised
mortgage were material because they were likely to affect the conduct or
decisions of consumers.

Therefore, Low VA Rates engaged in deceptive acts and practices in

violation of the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5531(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).

Deceptive Representations About Consumer Debt Elimination

In numerous instances, as described in Paragraphs 60-63, Low VA Ratesâ

elimination was available, would be offered, or arranged to be offered
including representations about debt elimination, when in fact debt
elimination was not available or was not what Low VA Rates was actually
prepared to offer or arrange to be offered.

Low VA Ratesâ misrepresentations about debt elimination were likely to
mislead consumers acting reasonably under the circumstances.

Low VA Ratesâ misrepresentations about the debt elimination in its
mortgage advertisements were material because they were likely to affect
the conduct or decisions of consumers.

Therefore, Low VA Rates engaged in deceptive acts and practices in
violation of the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 553 1(a), 5536(a)(1)(B).

Violations of the CFPA Based on Violations of
Regulation Z and the MAP Rule

Under the CFPA, a covered personâs violation of a Federal consumer
financial law, which includes enumerated consumer laws and rules
thereunder, violates the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5536(a)(1)(A), 5481(14).
Regulation Z and the MAP Rule are Federal consumer financial laws.

Low VA Ratesâ violations of Regulation Z and the MAP Rule, described in
Paragraphs 80-103, constitute violations of Â§ 1036(a)(1)(A) of the CFPA. 12

U.S.C. Â§ 5536(a)(1)(A).

To preserve the deterrent effect of the civil money penalty in any Related
Consumer Action, Respondent may not argue that Respondent is entitled to,
nor may Respondent benefit by, any offset or reduction of any compensatory
monetary remedies imposed in any Related Consumer Action because of the
civil money penalty paid in this action or because of any payment that the
Bureau makes from the Civil Penalty Fund. If the court in any Related
Consumer Action offsets or otherwise reduces the amount of compensatory
monetary remedies imposed against Respondent based on the civil money
penalty paid in this action or based on any payment that the Bureau makes
from the Civil Penalty Fund, Respondent must, within 30 days after entry of
a final order granting such offset or reduction, notify the Bureau, and pay the
amount of the offset or reduction to the U.S. Treasury. Such a payment will
not be considered an additional civil money penalty and will not change the
amount of the civil money penalty imposed in this action.
