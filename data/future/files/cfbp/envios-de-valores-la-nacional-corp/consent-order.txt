Bureau Findings and Conclusions
The Bureau finds the following:

Background
Respondent La Nacional is a non-bank remittance provider incorporated in
New York and headquartered in Colorado that conducts the majority of its
business in the greater New York metropolitan area. La Nacionalâs primary
business is to provide intemational money transfers, including remittance
transfers.
Respondent is licensed in 33 states and the District of Columbia and
provides remittance transfers from the United States to designated recipients
located primarily in the Dominican Republic, Mexico, Guatemala, El
Salvador, Ecuador, Colombia, Peru, Nigeria, Honduras, and Nicaragua.
Respondent provides these transfers through a network of branches and
agents.
Respondentâs remittancetransfers involve transmitting funds and constitute
payment services. These services are offered to consumers primarily for
personal, family, or household purposes. The services are therefore

âconsumer financial product[s] or service[s]â under the CFPA. 12 U.S.C.

Â§ 5481(6), (15)(A)(iv), (15)(A)(vii).

7. Respondent is also a remittance transfer provider under EFTA and
Regulation E because it provides remittance transfers for consumers in the
normal course of its business. 15 U.S.C. Â§ 16930-1(g)(3); 12 C.F.R.

Â§ 1005.30(f).

8. In 2010, EFTA was amended by adding Â§ 919 to create a comprehensive
system of consumer protections for remittance transfers sent by U.S.
consumers to individuals and businesses in foreign countries. Section 919
includes anumber of requirements related to remittance transfers, including

that:

e remittance transfer providers must disclose the amount to be
received, thecurrency, and the date of availability, both before and
at the time the consumer pays for the transfer, 15 U.S.C.
Â§ 16930-1(a)(1) & (2);

e consumers have certain rights regarding cancellation and refunds,
15 U.S.C. Â§ 16930-1(d);

e remittance transfer providers must investigate disputes and remedy
errors regarding remittances, 15 U.S.C. Â§ 16930-1(d); and

e remittance transfer providers are liable for certain acts of their
agents, 15 U.S.C. Â§ 16300-1(f).

9. The Bureau issued rules to implement these requirements, which became
effective on October 28, 2013. These rules are known as the Remittance

Rule.

Respondent provides remittance transfers to consumers using its retail
branches and a network of agents across the United States.

As of October 28, 2013, the effective date of the Remittance Rule,
Respondent has been subject to the requirements of EFTA and the
Remittance Rule.

Respondent failed to adequately comply with many ofthe Remittance Ruleâs
requirements.

Respondent violated Â§ 1005.34(a) by
failing to honor cancellation requests and
failing to provide cancellation rights

Section 1005.34 of the Remittance Rule requires remittance transfer
providers to honor any oral or written request to cancel a remittance transfer
from the sender that is received by the provider no later than 30 minutes
after the sender makes payment, provided that the request enables the
provider to identify pertinent information about the transfer, andthe funds
have not been received by the designated recipient.

Section 1005.34(b) also requires remittance transfer providers to refund, at
no additional cost to the consumer, the total amount of funds provided by the
sender in connection with a remittance transfer, including any fees and, to

the extent not prohibited by law, taxes imposed in connection with the

remittance transfer, within three business days of receiving a properly-
asserted cancellation request.

From the effective date of the Remittance Rule through at least April 2019,
Respondent failed to honor consumersâ properly-asserted cancellation
requests, andto provide refunds as a result of those requests, unless the
consumer appeared in person at the originating branch or agent location to
cancel their remittancetransfers.

From the effective date of the Remittance Rule through at least April 2019,
Respondent also failed to provide the 30-minute cancellation window to
consumers, and failed to provide a refund as a result of a properly-asserted
cancellation request, in instances where the originating branch or agent
location closed less than 30 minutes after the consumer initiated the transfer.
Therefore, Respondent violated 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1005.34(a).

Respondent violated Â§Â§ 1005.33(g)(1) and (g)(2)
by failing to develop and maintain policies and procedures
for error resolution under the Remittance Rule

Section 1005.33(g)(1) of the Remittance Rule requires remittance transfer
providers to develop and maintain written policies and procedures that are
designed to ensure compliance with the Ruleâs error resolution requirements.
Section 1005.33(g)(2) further requires that these policies and procedures

ensure theretention of any notices of error submitted by a remittance sender,

any documentation provided by the sender to the provider with respect to the
alleged error, and the providerâs findings.

From the effective date of the Remittance Rule through at least April 2019,
Respondentâs written policies and procedures did not reference the
requirements for complying with the error resolution requirements in the
Remittance Rule; did not set forth how Respondentâs employees and agents
should identify errors; did not define the types of records to be maintained;
and did not specify the length of time for which such records must be
maintained.

Therefore, Respondent violated 12 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1005.33(g)(1) and (g)(2).

Respondent violated Â§ 1005.33(c)(1) by failing
to investigate and make error determinations

Section 1005.33(c)(1) of the Remittance Rule requires a remittance transfer
provider, in response to a consumerâs properly-asserted error notice, to
investigate promptly and determine whether an error occurred, as defined
under section 1005.33(a)(1)(i)-(v).

Since the effective date of the Remittance Rule, Respondent has failed to
investigate promptly and determine whether an error, as defined under the
Remittance Rule, occurred.

Therefore, Respondent violated 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1005.33(c)1).

Respondent violated Â§ 1005.33(d) by failing
to provide written reports of its investigation findings

Section 1005.33(c)(1) of the Remittance Rule requires that, when a
consumer alleges that a remittance transfer provider committed an error, the
provider must promptly investigate the alleged error and provide the results
of its investigation to the sender within three business days after completing
its investigation. Ifthe provider determines that an error occurred as alleged
by the sender, the investigation results may be provided orally. 12 C.F.R.

Â§ 1005.31(a)(4). However, ifthe investigation finds no error or finds an
error different from the one alleged, the provider must provide the sender
with a written explanation. 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1005.33(d).

Since the effective date of the Remittance Rule, Respondent has failed to
provide consumers with written reports of its investigation findings where
no error occurred, ora different error occurred than the one identified in the
senderâs notice of error.

Therefore, Respondent violated 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1005.33(d).

Respondent violated Â§ 1005.33(c)(2)(ii)
by failing to refund certain fees and taxes

Section 1005.33(c)(2)(i1) of the Remittance Rule requires a remittance

transfer provider to refund transaction fees and taxes to a sender when the

provider fails to make funds available to the designated recipient by the
availability date on the receipt.

Since the effective date of the Remittance Rule, Respondent has failed to
refund fees and taxes to senders in instances where funds did not become
available to designated recipients by the date identified in the receipts.
Therefore, Respondent violated 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1005.33(c)(2)(i1).

Respondent violated $$ 1005.31-36 by failing
to treat international bill pay services as remittance transfers

Section 1005.30(e)(1) of the Remittance Rule establishes that for a service to
qualify as a remittance transfer: (1) there must be an electronic transfer of
funds; (2) thetransfer must be requested by a sender in the United States; (3)
the transfer must be sent to a designated recipient; (4) it must be sent by a
remittance transfer provider.

Respondent offered an international bill payment service that permitted
consumers in the United States to transfer funds to a designated recipient
outside of the country, through the recipientâs account with a commercial
entity such as a utility.

From the effective date of the Remittance Rule until September 2019,
Respondent failed to treat its international bill pay services as remittances

covered by the Remittance Rule.

Therefore, Respondent violated the disclosure requirements and failed to
provide the substantive rights in the Remittance Rule, 12 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1005.3 1-
36.
Respondent violated Â§Â§ 1005.31(b)(1) (ii) and 1005.31(b)(2)(i)
by issuing some prepayment disclosures and receipts that failed to
disclose the appropriate currency of the remittance transfer to be received
Section 1005.31 of the Remittance Rule requires a remittance transfer
provider to provide a sender with (1) a written prepayment disclosure with
information about the remittance transfer, and (2) a written receipt that
includes the information provided in the prepayment disclosure plus the
promised date of delivery, contact information for the designated recipient,
and information regarding certain sender rights.
Section 1005.3 1(b)(1)(vii) describes the substantive disclosure requirements
for prepayment disclosures, and section 1005.3 1(b)(2)(i) describes the
requirements for receipts, including the requirementthat providers disclose
to a sender âthe amount that will be received by the designated recipient, in
the currency in which the funds will be receivedâ in prepayment disclosures
and receipts.

Since the effective date of the Remittance Rule, some of Respondentâs

prepayment disclosures and receipts have failed to specify the currency in

which certain remittance transfers would be received, instead using the term
âNational Currency.â
Therefore, Respondent violated 12 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1005.31(b)(1 (vi) and
1005.31(b)(2)(i).
Respondent violated Â§Â§ 1005.31(b)(1) (ii) and
1005.31(b)(2) (i) by failing to use the term âtransfer feesâ
or a substantially similar term in some disclosures
Sections 1005.31(b)(1)(i1) and(b)(2)() of the Remittance Rule requires that
remittance transfer prepayment disclosures and receipts disclose to the
sender any fees imposed on the remittance transfer by the provider, in the
currency in which the remittance transfer is funded, using the term âTransfer
Feesâ or a substantially similar term.
Since the effective date of the Remittance Rule, Respondentâs prepayment
disclosures andreceipts used theterms âTelex,â âOmission,â and
âHandling,â to describe the fees it charged to consumers.
âTelex,â âOmission,â and âHandlingâ are not substantially similar to
âTransfer Fees.â
Therefore, Respondent violated 12 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1005.31(b)(1 (1) and (b)(2)(1).
Respondent violated Â§Â§ 1005.3 1(b)(2)(ii)

which remittance transfers would be available for pick-up
43.

Section 1005.3 1(b)(2)(1) of the Remittance Rule requires receipts issued by
remittance providers to disclose to a sender the date on which funds will be

âDate Availableâ or a substantially similar term.
Since the effective date of the Remittance Rule, some of Respondentâs
receipts have failed to identify the date on which the remittance transfers
would be available for pick-up by the designated recipients.
Therefore, Respondent violated 12 C.F.R. Â§ 1005.31(b\(2)(i1).
