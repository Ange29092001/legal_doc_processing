PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION, AND
OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF!

Hon. Timothy J. Corrigan

 

Plaintiff, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ), has filed a

Complaint for Permanent Injunction and Other Relief and moved, pursuant to Section 6c(a)

of the Commodity Exchange Act (the âActâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(a) (2012), for an ex parte

statutory restraining order freezing assets, appointing a Temporary Receiver, and ordering

Defendants Jason Scharf, CIT Investments LLC (âCIT Investmentsâ), Brevspand EOOD

(âBrevspandâ), CIT Investments, Ltd. (âCIT Anguillaâ), A & J Media Partners, Inc. (ââA&J

 

' Although this Order is filed under seal, the Clerk shall provide certified copies to counsel
for the Commission who is authorized and directed to forthwith serve copies on Defendants
with a copy of the complaint. Once Defendants have been served, the Court will unseal the

file upon motion.
Mediaâ), Michael Shah, and Zilmil, Inc. (âZilmilâ) (collectively, âDefendantsâ) to show
cause why a receiver should not be appointed and why a preliminary injunction should not be
issued.
The Court has considered the pleadings, declarations, exhibits, and memorandum
filed in support of the Commissionâs motion for a statutory restraining order, and held a
hearing on the motion on July 12, 2017, the record of which is incorporated by reference.
The Court finds that:
Ll: This Court has jurisdiction over the parties and over the subject matter of this
action pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1.
2. Venue lies properly within this District pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act,
7 ULS.C. Â§13a-1(e).
3, There is good cause to believe that Defendants Scharf, CIT Investments,
Brevspand, CIT Anguilla, and A&J Media, by and through their agents, principals, and
control persons, hereinafter collectively referred to as âCitrades Defendants,â have engaged
in, are engaging in, or are about to engage in:
a. off-exchange retail transactions in swaps, in violation of Section 2(e) of the
Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(e) (2012);

b. off-exchange transactions in commodity options, in violation of Section 4c(b)
of the Act, 7 U.S.C.Â§ 6c(b) (2012), and Regulation 32.2, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 32.2
(2017); and

Ã©. fraud in violation of:
I. Section 4c(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.Â§ 6c(b), and Regulation 32.4,

17 C.F.R. Â§ 32.4 (2017), which prohibit fraud in connection with
commodity options transactions;

I. Section 40(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 60(1) (2012), which prohibits
fraud by, among others, a commodity trading advisor (âCTAâ), and
Regulation 4.41(a), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 4.41(a) (2017), which prohibits fraud
in advertising by, among others, a CTA or any principal thereof; and

Hl. Section 6(c)(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 9(1) (2012), and Regulation
180.1(a), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 180.1(a) (2017), which prohibit fraud in
connection with swaps transactions.

There is good cause to believe that from June 2013 through the present (âRelevant
Periodâ), the Citrades Defendants, d/b/a Citrades.com and AutoTradingBinary.com, have
operated a massive scam in which the Citrades Defendants fraudulently solicited customers
to enter into illegal, off-exchange investments in so-called âbinary options.â During the
Relevant Period, the Citrades Defendants received at least $16 million in customer funds and
opened more than 140,000 accounts.

4. There is good cause to believe that Defendants Shah and Zilmil; by and
through their agents, principals, and control persons, hereinafter collectively referred to as
âZilmil Defendants,â have engaged in, are engaging in, or are about to engage in:

a. conducting activity with respect to off-exchange transactions in commodity

options, in violation of Section 4c(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6c(b), and

Regulation 32.2, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 32.2; and
b. fraud in violation of:

I Section 4c(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.Â§ 6c(b), and Regulation 32.4,

17 C.F.R. Â§ 32.4, which prohibit fraud in connection with commodity
options transactions;

Il. Section 40(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 60(1), which prohibits fraud by,
among others, a commodity trading advisor (âCTAâ), and Regulation
4.41(a), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 4.41(a), which prohibits fraud in advertising by,
among others, a CTA or any principal thereof; and

Ill. Section 6(c)(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 9(1), and Regulation 180.1(a),
17 C.F.R. Â§ 180.1(a), which prohibit fraud in connection with swaps
transactions.

5. There is good cause to believe that during the Relevant Period, the Zilmil
Defendants acted as third-party ââaffiliate marketersâ who drive internet traffic to the Citrades
Defendants by fraudulently soliciting customers to sign up for or purchase so-called binary
options autotrading systems with names like âMillionaire Money Machine.â When
customers sign up for the autotrading systems, they are instructed to send money to the
Citrades Defendants. During the Relevant Period, the Zilmil Defendants made gross
revenues of more than $4 million from sales of its autotrading systems and another $500,000
in commissions from the Citrades Defendants.

6. There is good cause to believe that immediate and irreparable damage to the
Courtâs ability to grant effective final relief for customers in the form of monetary or other

redress will occur from the sale, transfer, assignment, or other disposition by Defendants of
assets or records unless Defendants are immediately restrained and enjoined by Order of the
Court.

ie Therefore, there is good cause for the Court to freeze assets owned,
controlled, managed, or held by or on behalf of, or for the benefit of Defendants.

8. There is good cause for entry of an order prohibiting Defendants, their agents,
servants, employees, assigns, attorneys, and persons in active concert or participation with
the Defendants, including any successor thereof, from destroying records and/or denying
agents of the Commission access to inspect and copy records, when and as requested, to
ensure that Commission representatives have immediate and complete access to those books
and records,

9. There is good cause for the Plaintiff to conduct expedited discovery in order
to determine the full extent of Defendantsâ alleged wrongdoing, locate Defendantsâ other
customers, identify customer funds and other assets of the Defendants and clarify the source
and whereabouts of various funds.

10. There is good cause for the sppointment of a Temporary Receiver to take
control of all assets owned, controlled, managed or held by, on behalf of, or for the benefit of
Defendants in order to preserve assets, investigate and determine customer claims, determine
unlawful proceeds retained by Defendants and amounts due to customers as a result of
Defendantsâ alleged violations, and distribute remaining funds under the Courtâs supervision.

ll. There is good cause to require an accounting by Defendants to determine the

location and disposition of customer funds.
12. There is good cause to order repatriation of assets controlled by Defendants to
assure payment of restitution and disgorgement as authorized and for the benefit of
customers.

13. Absent the entry of this statutory restraining order, the Defendants are likely
to dissipate or transfer assets and destroy business records.

14. Weighing the equities and considering the Commissionâs likelihood of
success, this is a proper case for granting a statutory restraining order ex parte to preserve the
status quo, protect public customers from loss and damage, and enable the Commission to
fulfill its statutory duties, therefore the Court orders as follows:
