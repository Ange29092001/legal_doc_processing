COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF AND CIVIL
MONETARY PENALTIES UNDER THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT

The United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCFTCâ or âCommissionâ),

by and through its attorneys, hereby alleges as follows:
I. SUMMARY

1. From at least January 2016 through October 2016 (the ârelevant periodâ), William
H. Powderly I'V (âPowderlyâ or âDefendantâ) fraudulently solicited and accepted at least
$825,000 from at least four customers for purposes of trading commodity futures on their behalf
in an account in Powderlyâs and his wifeâs name (âPowderlyâs trading accountâ) at a registered
futures commission merchant (âFCMâ).

2. In soliciting customers and prospective customers, Powderly falsely claimed that
he and a purported partner, described as a university professor, had developed a commodity

futures trading program that generated exceptional hypothetical trading results and consistent

trading profits.
Case: 1:17-cv-03262 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/01/17 Page 2 of 13 PagelD #:2

3. Powderly, however, failed to tell customers and prospective customers that the
actual commodity trading he conducted for his FCM account was consistently unprofitable,
sustaining losses every month during the relevant period.

4, After customers invested funds with Powderly, he falsely represented that their
investmests had grown and claimed that the balance in his trading account was approximately
$2 million by September 2016, when in fact the balance in his trading account was actually only
$513 at the end of September 2016.

5. When customers subsequently sought returns of funds, Powderly lied to them,
falsely claiming that he could not transfer the requested funds because he had incurred large
losses over a period of a few days. To support his story, Powderly created and delivered false
FCM account statements for his account.

6. By virtue of this conduct and the conduct further described herein, Defendant
Powderly has engaged, is engaging in, or is about to engage in fraud in violation of Sections
4b(a)(1)(A)-(C) and 6(c)(1) of the Commodity Exchange Act (âActâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6b(a)(1)(A)-
(C), 9(1) (2012) and Commission Regulation (âRegulationâ) 180.1(a), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 180.1(a)
(2016).

7. Accordingly, pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2012), the
Commission brings this action to enjoin such acts and practices, prevent the dissipation of assets,
and compel compliance with the provisions of the Act. In addition, the Commission seeks civil
penalties, an accounting, restitution, disgorgement, rescission and such other statutory and

equitable relief as the Court may deem necessary or appropriate under the circumstances.
II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

8. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 6c of the Act,

7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2012), which authorizes the Commission to seek injunctive relief against any

2
Case: 1:17-cv-03262 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/01/17 Page 3 of 13 PagelD #:3

person whenever it shall appear to the Commission that such person has engaged, is engaging, or
is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a violation of any provision of the Act or
any rule, regulation or order thereunder.

9. Venue properly lies with this Court pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
Â§ 13a-1(e) (2012), in that Defendant transacted business in this District, and the acts and
practices in violation of the Act have occurred, are occurring, or are about to occur within this
District.

Il. THE PARTIES

PLAINTIFF

10. Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an independent federal regulatory
agency that is charged by Congress with the responsibility for administering and enforcing the
provisions of the Act and the Regulations promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1.1 ef seq.
(2016).
DEFENDANT

11. William H. Powderly IV is 6lyears old and resides in New Hope, Pennsylvania.
Powderly has never been registered with the Commission in any capacity.

IV. FACTS

Powderly Fraudulently Solicited Customers

12, Beginning in late December 2015, Powderly began soliciting prospective
customers from his circle of friends and acquaintances. Powderly represented to prospective
customers that he and a claimed partner, who Powderly described as a professor at a Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania university, had developed a proprietary, multi-algorithmic commodity futures
trading program that generated exceptional âbetaâ testing results. In promotional literature

Powderly created to solicit customers, he represented that over the 7 months of beta testing in the

3
Case: 1:17-cv-03262 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/01/17 Page 4 of 13 PagelD #:4

futures market, he and his partner had âgenerated consistent daily gains without a single day of
daily loss.â In reality, Powderly did not have a partner who helped develop the program.

13. __Insoliciting prospective customers, Powderly represented that he needed
investment capital in order to begin placing actual trades in the commodity futures markets,
utilizing his trading program. Powderly sought investment capital from customers who would
transfer funds to him directly, which Powderly would then transfer to fund and trade in his own
trading account at the FCM. Powderly also sought customers who would loan him money in the
form of an interest bearing note paying a specified rate of monthly interest and a specified
percentage of the net gain in assets in Powderlyâs trading account carried at the FCM on the
maturity date of the loan.

14. During the relevant period, Powderly met with customers and prospective
customers, in order to provide them with an opportunity to view his computerized trading
program and show them the hypothetical trading results that the program generated. During
these meetings, Powderly claimed that his hypothetical trading results using the trading program
were exceptional and that he never had a losing day. During these meetings, Powderly failed to
tell customers and prospective customers that the actual trading he conducted in his trading
account at the FCM was consistently unprofitable, and that he never had a profitable month
trading commodity futures for his account during the relevant time period.

15. Similarly, Powderly sent prospective customers and customers email
correspondence showing consistent profits generated by his hypothetical trading utilizing his

trading program. For example, in one emai] that Powderly sent to prospective customers on
December 12, 2015, he touted the success of his trading program and stated, âTotal for the week

$8,246,225.00 . . .â in hypothetical trading results.
Case: 1:17-cv-03262 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/01/17 Page 5 of 13 PagelD #:5

16. Based on Powderlyâs representations detailed in Paragraphs 12 through 15 above,
at least 4 customers transferred at least $825,000 to Powderly in the form of either (i) direct
transfers, or (ii) loan proceeds to Powderly, in all cases with the understanding that their funds
would be used to fund Powderlyâs account for purposes of commodity trading, and which
Powderly, in fact, primarily used to fund his commodity trading at the FCM.

Powderlyâs Actual Commodity Trading Performance during the Relevant Period

17. From January 2016, when Powderly began soliciting investors, through October
2016, Powderly funded his trading account with a total of $1,003,000. During that same period,
Powderlyâs trading account sustained net trading losses of approximately $997,527. Indeed,
Powderly never had a profitable month trading commodity futures for his account during the
foregoing time period, and Powderly failed to inform his customers and prospective customers

about his actual trading results.

After Customers Invested Funds with Powderly, He Falsely Represented that His
Commodity Trading Was Generating Profits and Falsified Account Statements

18. After customers transferred funds to Powderly for purposes of commodity
trading, Powderly falsely represented to them that his trading was very profitable. In particular,
Powderly represented to some customers that his commodity trading was so successful that his
trading account balance at the FCM had grown to approximately $2 million by September 2016.

19. | When learning that the trading account balance had increased significantly, some
customers requested that Powderly transfer a total of approximately $570,000 to them in order to
set aside funds to pay income taxes that they estimated would be due as a result of the trading
profits Powderly had purportedly generated in the trading account.

20. After these customers requested withdrawals, Powderly made excuses to them

about why he could not immediately transfer the funds to them. When Powderly could no longer
Case: 1:17-cv-03262 Document #: 1 Filed: 05/01/17 Page 6 of 13 PagelD #:6

forestall transferring the requested funds, Powderly falsely told customers that he incurred large
losses over a period of a few days in September 2016, when he allegedly had become ill and
couldnât monitor his trading system.

21. To support his false story that he had initially been successful, but then incurred
massive trading losses in September 2016, solely due to his poor health and his inability to
monitor his trading during that period, Powderly created false FCM account statements for the
months of August and September 2016 and sent them to his customers. The false FCM account
statements Powderly created for August 2016 and sent to his customers, showed net trading
profits of $517,537 for that month and an account balance on August 31, 2016 of $1,377,844.
The false FCM account statements that Powderly created for September 2016 and sent to his
customers, showed net trading losses of $1,263,427 for that month and an account balance on
September 30, 2016 of $74,216.

22. â In fact, Powderlyâs trading account incurred net realized losses of $121,848 in
August 2016 and had an account balance on August 31, 2016 of $18,478. Powderlyâs trading
account incurred net realized losses of $12,808 in September 2016 and had an account balance
on September 30, 2016 of $513.

23. | When Powderly refused to give his customers an accurate accounting of their
investments or the return of their monies, one investor notified the FCM that carried Powderlyâs
account by letter dated October 2, 2016, informing the FCM that Powderly had defrauded them.
To date, four customers who invested funds with Powderly have incurred total net losses of at

least $669,000.
