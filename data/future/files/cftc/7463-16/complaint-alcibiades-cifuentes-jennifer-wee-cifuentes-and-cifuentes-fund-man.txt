CIFUENTES FUND MANAGEMENT, LLC,

Defendants.

 

 

Plaintiff U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ) alleges as
follows:

I. INTRODUCTION
1. From at least April 2013 through March 2015 (the âRelevant Periodâ), Alcibiades

Cifuentes (âCifuentesâ) and Jennifer Wee Cifuentes, f/k/a Jennifer Fernandez Wee (ââWeeâ),
individually and as founders and principals of Cifuentes Fund Management, LLC (âCFMâ),
(collectively, âDefendantsâ) engaged in a fraudulent scheme to solicit and misappropriate funds
for a pooled investment vehicle in off-exchange leveraged or margined foreign currency
exchange (âforexâ) contracts in violation of the Commodity Exchange Act (âActâ) and its
implementing regulations (âRegulationsâ).

2. Cifuentes and Wee, through CFM, devised a sham forex pool in order to finance
their lavish lifestyles with funds misappropriated from pool participants. To execute their

scheme, Cifuentes and Wee knowingly made fraudulent and materia! misrepresentations and
Case 2:16-cv-06167 Document 1 Filed 09/30/16 Page 2 of 24 PagelD: 2

omissions about their forex trading strategy and investment returns to persuade at least 24
individuals (âpool participantsâ) to transfer approximately $590,000 to Defendants for the
purpose of participating in a pooled forex investment vehicle.

3. To entice pool participants, Cifuentes and Wee knowingly and falsely represented
that certain fictitious practice forex trades â carefully selected from a demonstration, or âdemo,â
account with no risk of loss â represented actual, and profitable, forex trades. Cifuentes and Wee
also fraudulently represented that CFM would pay pool participants âguaranteedâ monthly
returns equal to 10% of each deposit, paid quarterly. Cifuentes and Wee made these false
representations with the intent to defraud pool participants.

4. Rather than trading forex contracts with pool participantsâ funds, Cifuentes and
Wee â often without even attempting to trade the money entrusted to them â immediately
misappropriated all or most of pool participantsâ funds and used them to purchase luxury
vehicles, jewelry, and clothing for themselves, among other items. To prevent their fraud from
being uncovered, Cifuentes and Wee also diverted pool participantsâ deposits to other victims as
âdividendsâ in the manner of a Ponzi scheme.

5. To further conceal their fraud from pool participants, Cifuentes and Wee
fabricated account statements that falsely represented to pool participants that their funds were
deposited into CFM accounts and were generating significant returns. The fabricated account
statements did not disclose that Cifuentes and Wee had actually stolen all or most of pool
participantsâ funds and that the stated returns were, in fact, illusory.

6. By virtue of this conduct, and as more fully set forth below, Defendants have

engaged, are engaging, and/or are about to engage in acts and practices in violation of provisions
Case 2:16-cv-06167 Document1 Filed 09/30/16 Page 3 of 24 PagelD: 3

of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1-26 (2012), and the Regulations promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R.
Â§Â§ 1.1-190.10 (2016).

7. Accordingly, pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2012), the
Commission seeks civil monetary penalties and remedial ancillary relief including, but not
limited to, trading and registration bans, restitution, disgorgement, rescission, pre- and post-

judgment interest, and such other relief as the Court may deem necessary and appropriate.

II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE
8. This Court possesses jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 6c(a) of the

Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2012), which authorizes the Commission to seek injunctive and other
relief against any person whenever it appears to the Commission that such person has engaged, is
engaging, or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a violation of any provision of
the Act or any rule, regulation, or order thereunder, and Section 2(c)(2)(C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
Â§ 2(c)(2)(C) (2012), which provides the Commission with jurisdiction over the forex solicitations
and transactions at issue in this action.

9. Venue lies properly in this District pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
Â§ 13a-1(e) (2012), because Cifuentes and Wee reside in, transacted business in, and committed
acts and practices in violation of the Act and Regulations individually and on behalf of CFM
within this District.

Il. THE PARTIES

regulatory agency charged by Congress with the administration and enforcement of the Act and
Regulations. The Commission maintains its principal office at 1155 21st Street N.W.,

Washington, DC 20581.
Case 2:16-cv-06167 Document1 Filed 09/30/16 Page 4 of 24 PagelD: 4

11. Defendant Alcibiades Cifuentes is the spouse of Wee and, along with Wee, is one
of two founders and principals of CFM. During the Relevant Period, Cifuentes was the Chief
Executive Officer, Member, and Managing Principal of CFM. Along with Wee, Cifuentes is a
signatory on the bank accounts and forex trading accounts used by and on behalf of CFM.
Cifuentes resides in West New York, New Jersey. Cifuentes has never been registered in any
capacity with the Commission.

12. Defendant Jennifer Wee Cifuentes is the spouse of Cifuentes and, along with
Cifuentes, is one of two founders and principals of CFM. During the Relevant Period, Wee was
the Head of Trading and Risk Management and the Managing Principal of CFM. Along with
Cifuentes, Wee is a signatory on the bank accounts and forex trading accounts used by and on
behalf of CFM. Wee resides in West New York, New Jersey. Wee has never been registered in
any capacity with the Commission.

13. Defendant Cifuentes Fund Management, LLC is a Delaware limited liability
company organized on June 11, 2013. CFM lists its principal place of business as New York,
New York. CFM is the alter ego of Cifuentes and Wee. During the Relevant Period, Cifuentes
and Wee were the sole managers of CFM, Cifuentes and Wee were the only principals and
employees of CFM, Cifuentes and Wee comingled their personal funds with the funds of CFM,
and CFM held itself out as the âDBAâ (doing business as) entity of Cifuentes and Wee.

IV. FACTS

A. Operation of CFM

14. Onor about November 17, 2012, Cifuentes and Wee, in their names, opened joint
forex trading account *2899 with GFT Global Markets UK Ltd. (âGFTâ), (the âTrading
Accountâ), a now defunct online foreign exchange trading firm based in London, United

Kingdom (âUKâ). On or about February 19, 2013, Cifuentes and/or Wee made a sole deposit of

-4-
Case 2:16-cv-06167 Document1 Filed 09/30/16 Page 5 of 24 PagelD: 5

$3,490.44 into the Trading Account. By April 23, 2013, loss-making forex trades by Cifuentes
and/or Wee reduced the balance of the Trading Account to $130.94, meaning that in less than six
months Cifuentes and/or Wee had lost 96.25% of their original balance through forex trading.

15. In addition to offering live forex trading accounts, GFT permitted users to
establish âpractice,â or âdemo,â forex trading accounts to become familiar with the GFT trading
platform without risking real money. Trades placed in GFT practice accounts were for
demonstration purposes only and did not involve the actual purchase or sale of forex contracts.

16. In or around April 2013 Cifuentes and Wee established a GFT practice forex
trading account (the âDemo Accountâ). While Cifuentes and Wee occasionally made a
âprofitableâ practice trade in the Demo Account, the Demo Account on balance returned
fictitious net âlossesâ that exceeded $5 million during the Relevant Period.

17. On or about May 1, 2013, Cifuentes and Wee registered the Internet domain name
www.cifuentesfund.com, which they used to host CFMâs public website (the âCFM Websiteâ).
Cifuentes and Wee at all times managed and controlled the CFM Website and used the CFM
Website to solicit pool participants to transfer funds to Defendants.

18. During the Relevant Period, Cifuentes and Wee knowingly used the CFM
Website to solicit funds for a pooled investment vehicle that is not an eligible contract participant
in connection with off-exchange leveraged or margined forex contracts without being registered
with the Commission and make numerous fraudulent and false misrepresentations and material
omissions designed to attract pool participants. For example, Cifuentes and Wee selected
screenshots of their occasional fictitious profit-generating forex trades from the Demo Account
and posted them to the CFM Website, falsely representing that these practice trades reflected

CFMâs actual forex trades. Cifuentes and Wee did not disclose to prospective pool participants
Case 2:16-cv-06167 Document1 Filed 09/30/16 Page 6 of 24 PagelD: 6

that the posted practice trades were fictitious, that the posted practice trades involved no money
and no risk, or that overall the Demo Account was actually suffering massive net âlosses.â

19. Cifuentes and Wee used the CFM Website to market CFMâs purported investment
opportunities, including an âFX Certificate of Deposit.â Through the CFM Website, Cifuentes
and Wee described the FX Certificate of Deposit as a forex investment that generated profits
âguaranteed at a fixed rate of return of 10% per month,â with 6-month and 12-month deposits
respectively yielding â60% growth on expirationâ or â120% growth on expiration.â

20. In addition to the CFM Website, Cifuentes and Wee used e-mail communications,
telephone discussions, and face-to-face meetings to solicit pool participants to make initial
deposits into CFM or to increase their deposits into CFM. During these communications,
Cifuentes and Wee often represented that deposits into CFM would yield âguaranteedâ returns of
10% per month, paid quarterly.

21. At the direction of Cifuentes and Wee, pool participants entered into Subscription
Agreements with âAlcibiades Cifuentes and/or [sic] Jennifer Wee Cifuentes DBA Cifuentes
Fund Management, LLC.â The Subscription Agreements provided that Defendants would
transfer âsecuritiesâ reflecting a âlimited partnership interestâ to a pool participant in exchange
for the pool participantâs transfer of funds to Defendants. The Subscription Agreements further
provided that each pool participant would receive, on a quarterly basis, monthly dividends
âguaranteed to be no less thanâ 10 percent of the pool participantâs principal deposits. The
Subscription Agreements also provided that pool participants could withdraw their funds from
CFM and would receive redemptions via wire transfer, subject to âa 30-business day waiting

period.â Cifuentes and Wee often directed existing pool participants seeking to deposit
 

Case 2:16-cv-06167 Documenti1 Filed 09/30/16 Page 7 of 24 PagelD: 7

additional funds with CFM to enter into new Subscription Agreements covering the additional
deposits.

22. At the direction of Cifuentes and Wee, pool participants transferred funds via wire
and check payments to two CFM bank accounts (Wells Fargo account *2449 and Santander
Bank account *1166), as well as to one individual personal bank account of Cifuentes and six
individual personal bank accounts of Wee.

23. | Upon information and belief, Cifuentes and Wee never transferred pool
participantsâ funds to the Trading Account or used pool participant funds to trade forex. Instead,
Cifuentes and Wee misappropriated all or most of pool participantsâ funds â sometimes by
withdrawing pool participantsâ funds the very day such funds were deposited in Defendantsâ
bank accounts â to finance Cifuentesâs and Weeâs lavish lifestyles and pay for their personal
expenses,

24. For example, on May 20, 2014, pool participant R.V. wired $30,000 in poo!
participant funds to Cifuentesâs Citibank account *3584, which at the time held a balance of
$174.15. That same day, Cifuentes and/or Wee drew a $25,000 cashierâs check on Citibank
account *3584, made payable to a luxury car dealer in Secaucus, New Jersey. Also on May 20,
2014, Cifuentes and/or Wee used Citibank account *3584 to make a debit card purchase of
approximately $5,000 at Omega Boutique, a high-end watch vendor in Hackensack, New Jersey.

25. To prevent pool participants from discovering their fraud, Cifuentes and Wee also
misappropriated pool participantsâ deposits in the manner of a Ponzi scheme by diverting pool
participantsâ funds to other pool participants and falsely characterizing them as âdividends.â

26. Throughout the Relevant Period, Cifuentes and Wee falsely and fraudulently

represented to pool participants that their funds were used to trade or invest in forex contracts
Case 2:16-cv-06167 Documenti Filed 09/30/16 Page 8 of 24 PagelD: 8

and that money deposited with Defendants was safe, insured, and subject to rigorous risk-
management procedures. At no point did Cifuentes or Wee disclose to poo! participants that
their funds were being misappropriated.
B. Fraudulent Representations to Pool Participants
27. During the Relevant Period, Cifuentes and Wee knowingly used the CFM
Website to make the following false and fraudulent statements and material omissions to induce
pool participants to transfer funds to Defendants and to conceal Defendantsâ fraudulent scheme
from detection, among others:
a) Cifuentes and Wee posted Demo Account excerpts to the CFM Website and
represented them as CFMâs real forex trades placed between May and June 2013.
These representations were false and fraudulent because the Demo Account
excerpts did not reflect actual forex trades by CFM, and Cifuentes and Wee
selected only âprofitableâ fictitious trades to create the false impression that
CFMâs trades were successful.
b) Cifuentes and Wee represented, âwhat we can guarantee is that our clients [sic]
money will always be traded by reputable and financially strong Futures &
Commodities Merchants who are registered and regulated internationally.â This
statement was false and fraudulent because Cifuentes and Wee did not trade pool
participantsâ funds, and instead misappropriated such funds for their personal use.
c) Cifuentes and Wee represented that FX Certificates of Deposit purchased from
CFM were âguaranteed at a fixed rate of return of 10% per month,â that 6-month
Certificates would yield â10% per month @ 60% GROWTH ON EXPIRATION,â

and that 12-month Certificates would yield â10% per month @ 120% GROWTH
Case 2:16-cv-06167 Document1 Filed 09/30/16 Page 9 of 24 PagelD: 9

ON EXPIRATION.â These representations were false and fraudulent because

Cifuentes and Wee knowingly misappropriated all or most of pool participantsâ

funds, never purchased FX Certificates of Deposit, and because pool participants

did not receive the âguaranteedâ returns.
d) Cifuentes and Wee represented that pool participantsâ deposits were âFDIC

Insuredâ and were protected from loss by an âInvestor Compensation Fund.â

These representations were false and fraudulent because Cifuentes and Wee knew

at the time that pool participantsâ funds were not insured and that CFM did not

have an Investor Compensation Fund.
e) Cifuentes and Wee represented that CFM achieved profitability âthrough

algorithmic tradingâ involving âdiversified currencies and strategies.â These

representations were false and fraudulent because Cifuentes and Wee knew at the

time that CFM was not profitable, did not utilize algorithmic trading, did not trade

pool participantsâ funds in currencies (or anything), and did not employ any

trading strategies.

f) Cifuentes and Wee made material omissions to pool participants and prospective

pool participants, including by failing to disclose that: (i) Defendants did not

have a history of profitable forex trading; (ii) Defendants did not trade forex with

pool participantsâ funds; (iii) Cifuentes and Wee misappropriated pool

participantsâ funds for their personal use and to pay âdividendsâ to other pool

participants; and (iv) the Demo Account had actually âlostâ $5 million during the

Relevant Period.
Case 2:16-cv-06167 Document1 Filed 09/30/16 Page 10 of 24 PagelD: 10

28. Throughout the Relevant Period, Cifuentes and Wee knowingly made additional
false and fraudulent representations about their forex trading abilities and CFMâs âguaranteedâ
returns to pool participants and prospective pool participants via face-to-face meetings, e-mail,
and the telephone. These fraudulent communications were intended to lure pool participants into
depositing funds with CFM.

29. Induced by Cifuentesâs and Weeâs false and fraudulent representations, pool
participant N.M. entered into a Subscription Agreement with Defendants on November 1, 2013.
The Subscription Agreement falsely promised N.M. monthly dividends âguaranteed to be no less
thanâ 10% of N.M.âs $20,000 principal deposit, paid quarterly.

30. Between November 30, 2013, and April 4, 2014, N.M. entered into three
additional Subscription Agreements with Cifuentes and Wee, each of which falsely promised
N.M. monthly dividends of 10% of principal, paid quarterly.

31. Based upon Cifuentesâs and Weeâs false and fraudulent representations, N.M.
transferred a total of $76,000 in pool participant funds to Defendants via check and wire
payments during the Relevant Period. Cifuentes and Wee misappropriated N.M.âs funds for their
personal use almost immediately.

32. By way of example, on April 4, 2014, N.M. wired $16,000 in pool participant
funds to CFMâs Santander Bank account *1166, which Cifuentes and/or Wee had opened with a
balance of $500 on the prior day. On or about April 7, 2014, Cifuentes and/or Wee drew a
$9,500 check on Santander account *1166, made payable to a luxury car dealer in Secaucus,
New Jersey. Three days later, on April 10, 2013, Cifuentes and/or Wee made a $6,000 cash

withdrawal from Santander account *1166. The $6,000 cash withdrawal was misappropriated by

-10-
Case 2:16-cv-06167 Document 1 Filed 09/30/16 Page 11 of 24 PagelD: 11

Cifuentes and/or Wee and was not used to trade or invest in forex (or anything else) on behalf of
N.M.

33. Pool participant R.V. also lost money as a result of Cifuentesâs and Weeâs false
and fraudulent representations. Induced by Cifuentesâs and Weeâs false and fraudulent
representations and omissions, R.V. executed three Subscription Agreements with Cifuentes and
Wee between February 27, 2013, and May 19, 2014, each of which falsely promised R.V.
âguaranteedâ monthly dividends equal to 10% of principal, paid quarterly.

34. Based upon Cifuentesâs and Weeâs false and fraudulent representations, on May
20, 2014, R.V. made six wire transfers to Defendants totaling $126,000. Cifuentes and Wee
immediately misappropriated al! or most of R.V.âs funds to pay for their personal expenses
and/or to support their lavish lifestyles, including luxury vehicles and jewelry.

35. | Toconceal their misappropriation of N.M.âs and R.V.âs pool participant funds,
Cifuentes and Wee generated false and fraudulent account statements during the Relevant
Period. The fabricated account statements provided fake âReturns Earned,â and identified
illusory balances in N.M.âs and R.V.âs CFM accounts. In reality, such returns did not exist, and
Cifuentes and Wee had long since misappropriated N.M.âs and R.V.âs funds.

36. To prevent their fraud from being detected, Cifuentes and Wee at various times
during the Relevant Period provided pool participants with âdividendsâ paid by check and wire
transfer. Contrary to Cifuentesâs and Weeâs representations, these âdividendâ checks were not
the result of profitable forex trading or investment, but were the diverted funds of other pool
participants. By way of example, between September 5, 2014, and January 5, 2015, Defendants
used CFMâs Wells Fargo Bank account *2449 to write six âdividendâ checks payable to N.M.,

each in the amount of $6,000. Cifuentes signed each check on behalf of CFM.

-li-
Case 2:16-cv-06167 Documenti Filed 09/30/16 Page 12 of 24 PagelD: 12

37. While some pool participants during portions of the Relevant Period received the
âdividendâ payments they expected, others did not. On or about August 14, 2014, Wee, unable
to access sufficient funds to provide pool participant R.V. with an expected dividend of $19,400,
wired a âpartialâ dividend of $3,939 to R.V. Between August and October 2014, Wee
knowingly made a series of false statements to R.V. to explain why the full dividend amounts
R.V. expected had not been paid, including that: (i) financial institution delays were to blame for
the incomplete dividend payments; (ii) Wee had sent wire transfers to R.V. that she had not in
fact sent; and (iii) fictitious international âbankersâ acting on behalf of CFM were unavailable to
submit wire transfers. Wee knowingly made these false statements for the purpose of concealing
from R.V. that Cifuentes and Wee had misappropriated all or most of R.V.âs deposits with CFM.
