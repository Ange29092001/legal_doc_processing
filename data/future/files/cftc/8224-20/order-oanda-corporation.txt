ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTION 6(c) AND (d) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, MAKING
FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

I. INTRODUCTION

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ) has reason to believe that
at times in or around October 2018 and during the period April 2019 to August 2019, OANDA
Corporation ââOANDAââ) violated Regulations 1.17(e)(1), 5.6(a), (b), and (f), 5.7(a)(1)G) and
(a)(3), and 166.3, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1.17(e)(1), 5.6(a), (b), (, 5.7(aC)@), (a)(3), 166.3 (2019).
Therefore, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest that public
administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted to determine whether OANDA engaged
in the violations set forth herein and to determine whether any order should be issued imposing
remedial sanctions.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, OANDA has submitted
an Offer of Settlement (âOfferâ), which the Commission has determined to accept. Without
admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, OANDA consents to the entry of
this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Section 6(c) and (d) of the Commodity Exchange
Act, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (âOrderâ), and acknowledges service
of this Order.â

 

' OANDA consents to the use of the findings of fact and conclusions of law in this Order in this
proceeding and in any other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission
is a party or claimant, and agrees that they shall be taken as true and correct and be given
preclusive effect therein, without further proof. OANDA does not consent, however, to the use
of this Order, or the findings or conclusions herein, as the sole basis for any other proceeding
brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party or claimant, other than: a
proceeding in bankruptcy or receivership; or a proceeding to enforce the terms of this Order.
OANDA does not consent to the use of the Offer or this Order, or the findings or conclusions in
this Order, by any other party in any other proceeding.
II. FINDINGS
The Commission finds the following:

A. SUMMARY

As set forth below, in or around October 2018 and during the period April 2019 to
August 2019, OANDA failed at times to meet certain financial requirements applicable to futures
commission merchants (âFCMsââ) offering or engaging in retail foreign currency transactions
and/or retail foreign exchange dealers (âRFEDsââ): (1) OANDA failed to meet minimum capital
requirements from April 26, 2019 to August 21, 2019 and (2) OANDA made dividend payments
on October 15, 2018, April 26, 2019, and May 28, 2019 in violation of the equity withdrawal
restriction. In addition, OANDA violated certain reporting requirements related to its violations
of these financial requirements. The Commissionâs Division of Enforcement has found no
indication that customers suffered any losses as a result of OANDAâs net capital and equity
withdrawal restriction violations. OANDA did not maintain adequate internal controls with
respect to these financial and reporting requirements; consequently, the firm failed to diligently
supervise these matters related to its business as a Commission registrant.

In accepting OANDAâs offer of settlement, the Commission recognizes OANDAâs
cooperation in the investigation of this matter.

B. RESPONDENT

OANDA Corporation is a registered FCM and RFED headquartered in Toronto,
Canada. OANDA acts as counterparty to customer accounts trading foreign currency (âforexââ)
and provides its customers an electronic trading platform through which its customers enter into
forex trades. OANDA has been a registered with the Commission as an FCM since 2003 and
as an RFED since October 2010.

C. FACTS
1. Background

As an FCM offering or engaging in retail forex transactions and RFED, OANDA is
subject to Parts 1, 5, and 166 of the Regulations, 17 C.F.R. pts. 1, 5, 166 (2019). Pursuant to Part
5 of the Regulations, OANDA is required to maintain, at all times, adjusted net capital of the
greater of $20 million plus five percent of its total retail forex obligation in excess of $10 million
or any amount required by Regulation 1.17. Regulation 5.7(a)(1)G)(B) and (a)(3), 17 C.F.R.

Â§ 5.7(a)G)(B), (a)(3) (2019). OANDA is required to provide telephonic notice, to be confirmed
in writing, immediately when it knows, or should know, of a capital deficiency and to provide
written notice within 24 hours of the firmâs breach of early warning levels. Regulation 5.6(a)
and (b), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 5.6(a), (b) (2019).

In addition, Regulation 1.17(e)(1) requires OANDA to maintain 120% of required
adjusted net capital immediately following any withdrawal of equity capital, and Regulation
5.6(f) requires OANDA to notify the Commission within two business days after an equity
withdrawal that causes adjusted net capital to be reduced by 20% or more from the amount last
reported in the firmâs Form 1-FR filed with the Commission, and to notify the Commission two
business days prior to any equity withdrawal that would cause excess net capital to be reduced by
30% or more from the previously reported amount. 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1.17(e)(1), 5.6(f) (2019).

2. Violations of Capital Requirements, Equity Withdrawal Restriction,
Notice Requirements, and Duty to Diligently Supervise

From April 2019 to August 2019, OANDA improperly included in its capital
computation unsecured receivables accruing from over-the-counter forex transactions from an
entity that was not one of the following: (1) a bank or trust company regulated by a U.S.
banking regulator; (2) a broker dealer registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission
and a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority; (3) a Commission-registered FCM
or RFED and National Futures Association (âNFAâ) member; (4) an entity regulated as a foreign
equivalent of any of the foregoing; or (5) an entity approved by OANDAâs designated self-
regulatory organization, i.e. NFA. Regulation 5.7(b)(2)ai1), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 5.7(b)(2) Gi) (2019).
Because the unsecured receivables at issue here were not with a qualifying entity enumerated in
Regulation 5.7(b)(2)(ii1), they should not have been included as current assets for purposes of
OANDAâs capital calculation.

During the relevant time period OANDA used a prime broker, Entity A, that was a
qualifying entity under Regulation 5.7(b)(2)(i11), to execute the over-the-counter forex
transactions at issue here. These transactions were given up (pursuant to a give-up arrangement)
from Entity A to Entity B, a provisionally registered swap dealer with the Commission, which
was not a qualified entity under Regulation 5.7(b)(2)(ii1). In addition, agreements between
OANDA and Entity B required that the collateral in connection with these over-the-counter forex
transactions be custodied by an affiliated FCM of Entity B (and therefore a qualified entity under
Regulation 5.7(b)(2)(ii1)). However, because the unsecured receivables at issue here were from
Entity Bânot from Entity A or Entity Bâs affiliate FCMâthe unsecured receivables were not
permitted to be included in OANDAâs capital calculation.

After excluding funds and positions held with the non-qualifying entity from OANDAâs
capital calculation, OANDA was undercapitalized a total of 118 calendar days, from April 26 to
August 21, 2019, with capital deficits ranging from approximately $30 million to almost $144
million. Moreover, OANDA did not notify the Commission of the deficiencies until August 22
and August 26, 2019, after the NFA brought the issue to the firmâs attention.

On October 15, 2018, OANDA made a $37.5 million dividend payment as part of a
distribution of excess cash to shareholders related to the acquisition of OANDA. The October
15, 2018 dividend payment caused the firmâs adjusted net capital to fall below the firmâs equity
withdrawal restriction level of 120% of its required adjusted net capital. In addition, the
payment reduced the firmâs adjusted net capital by more than 45% and the firmâs excess net
capital by more than 91% from the amounts previously reported in OANDAâs September 30,
2018 Form 1-FR filed with the Commission. Regulation 5.6(f) requires notice to the
Commission within two business days of a reduction in adjusted net capital of 20% or more and
two business daysâ notice prior to a reduction in excess net capital of 30% or more. OANDA
did not, however, provide notice until November 9, 2018, after being prompted by the NFA. In
addition, the October 15, 2018 dividend payment, along with two additional dividend payments
in October, caused OANDAâs adjusted net capital to fall below early warning levels as of
October 31, 2018. However, the firm did not provide 24-hour notice as required under
Regulation 5.7(b), but rather provided notice on November 28, 2018, after being notified by the
CFTC about the early warning reporting requirement.

In addition, at the ttme OANDA was undercapitalized, it paid dividends to its parent
company in the amount of $11.25 million on April 26, 2019 and $3.5 million on May 28, 2019.
Because these payments increased the extent to which the firm was already undercapitalized,
OANDA violated the equity withdrawal restriction, and consequently, the dividend payments
should not have been permitted to occur.

The Commissionâs Division of Enforcement has found no indication that customers
suffered any losses as a result of OANDAâs net capital and equity withdrawal restriction
violations.

As evidenced by the failures described above, OANDA failed to establish and maintain
an adequate supervisory system. At the time of OANDAâs equity withdrawal violation in
October 2018, OANDAâs procedures were not sufficient to prevent the firmâs violation of the
equity withdrawal restriction and related notice requirements. In addition, the procedures in
place at the time of OANDAâs 2019 net capital violations were not sufficient to prevent the
violation of net capital and associated notice requirements. OANDA took steps to improve its
policies and procedures after both the equity withdrawal violation of October 2018 and net
capital violations from April to August 2019.

3. Remedial Actions

After OANDA was notified that it could not count toward its capital calculation
unsecured receivables accruing from over-the-counter forex transactions from an entity not
qualified under Regulation 5.7(b)(2)ai1), OANDA took steps the next calendar day to correct the
violation by transferring funds and positions to qualifying entities under that rule. In addition, as
noted above, OANDA has taken steps to improve its relevant policies and procedures.

Hil. LEGAL DISCUSSION

A. OANDA Failed to Comply with Financial and Related Reporting Requirements

1. Failure to Comply with Minimum Capital
Requirements and Related Notice Requirement

As noted above, FCMs offering or engaging in retail forex transactions and RFEDs are
required to maintain at all times adjusted net capital of the greater of at least $20 million plus
five percent of their total retail forex obligations in excess of $10 million or any amount required
by Regulation 1.17. Regulations 5.7(a)(1)G) and (a)(3), 17 C.F.R. 88 5.7(a)(D@), (a)(3) (2019).
Regulation 5.7(b)(2)(ii1) further requires, among other things, that for purposes of calculating
adjusted net capital, current assets may not include unsecured receivables accruing from over-
the-counter forex-related transactions, unless the unsecured receivables are from an eligible
contract participant that is among the regulated entities enumerated in that subsection, 1.e., a
U.S.-regulated bank or trust company, a registered broker-dealer, a registered FCM, a registered
RFED, a similar foreign-regulated entity, or an entity approved by the FCM/RFEDâs designated
self-regulatory organization. 17 C.F.R. Â§5.7(b)(2)G@i) (2019).

Regulation 5.6(a) requires FCMs that offer or engage in retail forex transactions and
RFEDs to provide immediate telephonic notice, to be confirmed in writing, when the firm
knows, or should know, of a capital deficiency. 17 C.F.R. Â§ 5.6(a) (2019). Regulation 5.6(b)
further requires such firms to provide written notice within 24 hours of the firmâs breach of early
warning levels. 17 C.F.R. Â§ 5.6(b) (2019).

From April 26, 2019 to August 21, 2019, OANDA failed to meet minimum capital
requirements because it counted towards its adjusted net capital unsecured receivables, in
connection with certain over-the-counter foreign currency transactions, from an entity that was
not one of the qualifying entities enumerated in Regulation 5.7(b)(2)a@i1). OANDA was
undercapitalized a total of 118 calendar days, from April 26 to August 21, 2019, with capital
deficits ranging from approximately $30 million to almost $144 million. Moreover, OANDA
did not notify the Commission of the deficiencies immediately, as required by Regulation 5.6(a),
but rather did not notify the Commission until August 22, 2019 and August 26, 2019, after the
NFA brought the issue to the firmâs attention.

2. Violation of Equity Withdrawal
Restriction and Related Notice Requirements

Regulation 1.17(e)(1) prohibits FCMs from withdrawing equity capital if, following the
withdrawal, the FCMâs adjusted net capital would be less than 120% of its required adjusted net
capital (1.e., the equity withdrawal restriction level). 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.17(e)C1) (2019).

Additionally, Regulation 5.6(f) requires FCMs offering or engaging in retail foreign currency
and RFEDs to notify the Commission within two business days after an equity withdrawal causes
the firmâs adjusted net capital to be reduced by 20% or more from the amount last reported in the
firmâs Form 1-FR filed with the Commission, and to notify the Commission two business days
prior to any equity withdrawal that would cause excess net capital to be reduced by 30% or more
from the previously reported amount. 17 C.F.R. Â§ 5.6(f) (2019).

The October 15, 2018 dividend payment caused OANDAâs adjusted net capital to fall
below 120% of its required adjusted net capital. Consequently the firm should not have made
that dividend payment. In addition, the October 15, 2018 payment reduced OANDAâs adjusted
net capital by more than 20% from the amount previously reported on the firmâs Form 1-FR, and
reduced the firmâs excess net capital by more than 30% from the amount previously reported.
However, OANDA did not report the decline in excess net capital/adjusted net capital until
November 9, 2018. In addition, the October 15, 2018 dividend payment, along with two other
dividend payments in October 2018, caused the firmâs adjusted net capital to fall below early
warning levels, but the firm did not provide notice to the CFTC until November 28, 2018, after

5
being notified by the CFTC about this reporting requirement. Because notice was provided more
than 24 hours after breaching the early warning level, OANDA violated Regulation 5.7(b).

Moreover, OANDA again violated the equity withdrawal restriction by paying dividends
to its parent company in the amount of $11.25 million and $3.5 million on April 26, 2019 and
May 28, 2019, respectively, while the firm was undercapitalized.

B. Failure to Supervise

Regulation 166.3, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 166.3 (2019), requires every Commission registrant to
âdiligently supervise the handling by its partners, officers, employees and agents .. . of all
commodity interest accounts carried, operated, advised, or introduced by the registrant and all
other activities of its partners, officers, employees and agents . . . relating to its business as a
Commission registrant.â A violation under Regulation 166.3 is an independent violation for
which no underlying violation is necessary. See, e.g., In re Collins, CFTC No. 94-13, 1997 WL
761927, at* 10 (Dec. 10, 1997) (âIt is well settled that a violation under Rule 166.3 is âan
independent and primary violation for which no underlying violation is necessary.â (citation
omitted)); In re GNP Commodities, Inc., CFTC No. 89-1, 1992 WL 201158, at *17 n.11 (Aug.
11, 1992), affd sub nom. Monieson v. CFTC, 996 F 2d. 852 (7th Cir. 1993) (âRule 166.3
establishes failure to supervise as an independent and primary violation ....â (citation
omitted)).

In order to prove a violation of Regulation 166.3, the Commission must demonstrate that
either: (1) the registrantâs supervisory system was generally inadequate; or (2) the registrant
failed to perform its supervisory duties diligently. GNP Commodities, Inc., 1992 WL 201158, at
*19, The lack of an adequate supervisory system can be established by showing that the
registrant failed to develop proper procedures for the detection of wrongdoing. CFTC v. Trinity
Fin. Grp, Inc., No. 92-cv-6832, 1997 WL 820970, at *29 (S.D. Fla. Sept. 29, 1997), aff'd in part,
vacated in part, and remanded sub nom. CFTC v. Sidoti, 178 F.3d 1132, 1137 (11th Cir. 1999).
Where a supervisory system was in place, the issue is whether it was diligently administered. Jn
re Paragon Futures Assân, CFTC No. 88-18, 1992 WL 74261, at *14 (Apr. 1, 1992) (â[T]he
focus of any proceeding to determine whether Rule 166.3 has been violated will be on whether
such review occurred and, if it did, whether it was âdiligent.ââ); Collins, 1997 WL 761927, at
*10. Evidence of violations that âshould be detected by a diligent system of supervision, either
because of the nature of the violations or because the violations have occurred repeatedlyâ is
probative of a failure to supervise. In re Paragon Futures, 1992 WL 74261, at *14.

With respect to compliance with minimum financial requirements and related reporting
requirements, OANDA employed an inadequate supervisory system and failed to perform its
supervisory duties diligently, in violation of Regulation 166.3. These supervisory failures
prevented OANDA from complying with the equity withdrawal restriction and minimum capital
requirements, and also prevented OANDA from providing required notice to the Commission
regarding capital.
IV. FINDINGS OF VIOLATIONS

Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that OANDA violated Regulations
1.17(e)(1), 5.6(a), (b), and (f), 5.7(a)(1)G) and (a)(3), and 166.3, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1.17(e)(1), 5.6(a),
(b), @), 5.7(ayC)@), (a)(3), 166.3 (2019).
