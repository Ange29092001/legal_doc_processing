ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTIONS 6(c) AND 6(d) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT,
MAKING FINDINGS AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

I.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ) has reason to believe that
David Liew (âLiewâ or âRespondentââ) has violated the Commodity Exchange Act (the âActâ or
ââCEAâ) and Commission Regulations (âRegulationsâ). Therefore, the Commission deems it
appropriate and in the public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are,
instituted to determine whether Respondent engaged in the violations set forth herein and to
determine whether any order should be issued imposing remedial sanctions.

I.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Respondent has
submitted an Offer of Settlement (âOfferââ) that the Commission has determined to accept.
Respondent admits the facts set forth below, acknowledges that his conduct violated the Act and
Regulations, admits the Commissionâs jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of these
proceedings, and consents to the entry and acknowledges service of this Order Instituting
Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 6(c) and 6(d) of the Commodity Exchange Act, Making
Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (âOrderâ).

IIL.
The Commission finds the following:
A. SUMMARY

From at least December 2009 through February 2012 (âRelevant Periodâ), Liew, acting
individually and in coordination with other traders on the precious metals trading desk at a large
financial institution (âFinancial Institution 1â), engaged in a scheme to manipulate the market
price of gold and silver futures contracts by utilizing manual spoofing techniques designed to
cause price movements in the market that Liew could exploit through his trading.

On numerous occasions, Liew, both individually and in coordination with other traders
on the precious metals trading desk of Financial Institution 1, placed orders to buy or sell gold or
silver futures contracts that he did not intend to execute at the time the orders were placed
(âspoof ordersâ). On those occasions, Liew intended to induce other market participants into
buying and selling gold or silver futures contracts. In engaging in the unlawful spoofing
conduct, Liew also intended to manipulate and, on occasion, succeeded in manipulating the price
of gold and silver futures contracts. Liew, individually and in coordination with other precious
metals traders, sought to and at times did benefit from the artificial prices by executing buy or
sell orders at artificial prices.

Separately, on certain occasions, Liew placed orders and executed trades with the intent
of manipulating the market price of gold and silver futures contracts for the purpose of triggering
customersâ stop-loss orders.â Liew coordinated this trading with another precious metals trader
(âTrader Aâ) at another large financial institution (âFinancial Institution 2â). The intent of
triggering the customer stop-loss orders was to allow the traders to buy precious metals futures
contracts at artificially low prices or sell precious metals futures contracts at artificially high
prices.

In accepting the Offer of Settlement, the Commission recognizes Liewâs cooperation
during the Division of Enforcementâs (âDivisionâ) investigation of this matter, including his
entry into a formal Cooperation Agreement (âCooperation Agreementâ) with the Division, his
provision of substantial assistance to the investigation and his undertaking to continue to
cooperate with the Commission, the Division and any other governmental agency in connection
with any investigation, litigation or administrative proceeding relating to the subject matter of
this Order.

B. RESPONDENT

David Liew was employed as a junior trader on the precious metals desk in a foreign
office of Financial Institution 1 during the Relevant Period. Liew has never been registered with
the Commission in any capacity.

C. FACTS

During the Relevant Period, Liew worked on the precious metals trading desk, which,
among other things, engaged in market making and proprietary trading in precious metals spot
and futures markets. As part of Liewâs duties, he placed orders and entered into transactions for
gold and silver futures contracts traded on the Commodity Exchange, Inc. (âCOMEXâ), a futures

 

' A stop-loss order, or stop order, is an order that becomes a market order when a particular price level is
reached. A sell stop is placed below the market; a buy stop is placed above the market.

2
exchange and designated contract market which is owned and operated by CME Group, Inc.
(âCMEâ).

Liewâs trading practices included placing, or coordinating with other precious metals
traders at Financial Institution 1 to place, hundreds of bids or offers with the intent to cancel
before execution (i.e., spoofing orders). In a March 29, 2011 chat with Trader A at Financial
Institution 2, Liew explained his spoofing strategy: âbasically i sold out... by just having fake
bids... [in] the futures ... i just spam bids below ... to clear my offer.â Generally, Liewâs spoof
orders were placed in the futures market after another bid or offer was placed on the opposite
side of the same market. Liew placed his spoof orders with the intent to create the false
appearance that the market interest in buying or selling was greater than the actual market
interest. Liew placed such spoof orders with the intent to induce other market participants to fill
Liewâs resting orders on the opposite side of the market from his spoof orders. In engaging in
the spoofing conduct, Liew also intended to manipulate, and at times succeeded in manipulating
the price of the relevant futures contract. Thereafter, Respondent cancelled the spoof orders after
the resting orders were filled or the spoof orders were at too great a risk of being executed.

As noted above, in addition to executing the spoofing strategy individually, at times,
Liew coordinated with one or more traders on the precious metals trading desk of Financial
Institution 1 to implement his spoofing strategy.

Stop-Loss Manipulation

During the Relevant Period, on occasion, Liew attempted to manipulate, and at times,
succeeded in manipulating the gold and silver futures market prices to trigger customer stop-loss
orders in order to obtain a profit. Liew coordinated this trading with Trader A at Financial
Institution 2.

On certain occasions, Liew would communicate with Trader A at Financial Institution 2
to determine the level in the market that stop-loss orders were resting, and would coordinate
trading for the purpose of triggering stop-loss orders. Liew engaged in this conduct intending to
manipulate the prices of the gold and silver futures contracts. Liew executed trades with the
understanding that he, together with Trader A, had the ability to affect or influence prices. In
certain instances, Liew and Trader A succeeded in manipulating the prices of the gold and silver
futures contracts.

For example, on January 7, 2011, Liew asked Trader A at Financial Institution 2, via a
chat, about the level in the market at which customer stop loss orders were resting. Liew told the
other trader, âi can hunt with u.â A few minutes later, the other trader asked Liew âyo can u help
me push silver down?â Liew agreed to execute trades to push the price of COMEX silver futures
market down to trigger the resting stop loss orders, and did so by entering orders to sell with the
intent to manipulate prices. When the market reached the stop level that they were seeking, Liew
told Trader A âthere u go.â Liew then bought back the silver contracts, eliminating his exposure
to risk from further price movements in the silver futures market and generating a profit.
In another example, on March 29, 2011, Trader A asked Liew for assistance in the gold
futures market, asking Liew to âpush it upâ because Trader A âneed[ed] a print.â Liew bought
gold futures contracts with the intent to push prices up as requested. Immediately after Trader A
told Liew that he âgot itâ [1.e., the print], Liew then sold back the gold futures contracts,
eliminating his exposure to risk from further price movements in the gold futures market and
generating a profit.
