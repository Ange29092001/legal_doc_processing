FTC v. Digital Income System,
Inc. et al.

1:20-cv-24721
S.D. Fla.

(Florida)

1 corporate and five individual
defendants

Civil Lawsuit: The FTCâs complaint alleges that this Florida-based scam falsely
told consumers that by selling memberships in the defendantsâ programs,
consumers were likely to earn large sums of money. For example, the website
stated, âConsumers will earn between $500 and $12,500 per sale.â The
defendants allegedly charged consumers a substantial amount of money,

â ranging from $1,000 to $25,000. The complaint states, however, that the
vast majority of consumers who paid the defendants never earned substantial
income, and in fact many consumers earned nothing.

FTC v. Moda Latina BZ Inc. et

C.D. Cal.

(California)

1 corporate and 2 individual
defendants

 

Civil Lawsuit: The FTC sued Moda Latina BZ Inc. and its principals for allegedly
operating a deceptive scheme targeting Latina consumers in Spanish-language
ads on TV with false promises of earnings at home. The complaint states

that defendants lured consumers into purchasing work-at-home business
opportunities by misrepresenting that they could make âlarge profitsâ re-selling
luxury products such as brand-name perfumes. One misrepresentation alleged
in the complaint is âCrisis? What crisis? | forgot about that ever since | started
selling with Perfume Box. It completely changed my life and my finances.â The
complaint also alleges that the defendantsâ telemarketers routinely threaten
consumers in violation of the Telemarketing Sales Rule. From March 2017 to
August 2020, the FTC alleges, the defendants took more than $7 million from
consumers who purchased their work-at-home opportunities but did not make
the promised earnings.

(Randon Morris)

D. Utah

(Utah)

1 individual and 4 corporate
defendants

Civil Lawsuit: The FTCâs complaint alleges that defendants initiated millions of
robocalls nationwide to promote sham work-from-home business opportunity
programs. The defendants lured consumers into purchasing these programs
with false promises that consumers could earn hundreds of dollars a day and
claimed an affiliation with Amazon.com where none existed. They also invoked
the coronavirus pandemic in robocall messages to prey on consumers who are
concerned about working outside of their homes during a national public health

6 corporate and 3 individual
defendants

 

 

Civil Lawsuit: The FTCâs complaint alleges that the defendants fraudulently
marketed investment-related services that they claimed would enable
consumers to make consistent profits and beat the market. Instead, the FTC
alleges that consumers â many of them retirees, older adults, and immigrants
â have lost at least $137 million to the scam in just the last three years. The
defendants claimed in their pitches that consumers donât need a lot of time,
money, or experience, and that the global coronavirus pandemic represents a
great time to pay hundreds or thousands of dollars to learn their secret trading
techniques, claiming in one ad that the pandemic â...might be the most exciting
opportunity in decades!â

4 corporate and 6 individual

Civil Lawsuit: The ten defendants in this 2019 case, who the FTC alleged
targeted older adults while selling phony money-making opportunities, have
settled the FTCâs charges against them. Under the terms of two stipulated final
orders, the defendants either are banned from selling money-making methods or
business coaching programs, and nine of the defendants are banned from using
robocalls for most purposes, including marketing or advertising. In addition,
three defendants are prohibited from selling any investment opportunities. The
stipulated final orders impose monetary judgements totaling more than $32
million, which are partially suspended based on the defendantsâ inability to pay.

(Nevada)

4 corporate and 4 individual
defendants

 

 

Civil Lawsuit: The FTCâs Second Amended Complaint alleges that defendants
have been operating two pyramid schemes: Success By Health (launched in
July 2017) and VOZ Travel (launched in October 2019). The defendants promised
wealth and income to consumers who joined either the SBH instant coffee or
VOZ Travel wholesale travel sales scheme, but the complaint alleges that less
than 2 percent of participating consumers received more money than they

paid in. SBH and VOZ Travelâs plans emphasize and incentivize recruiting new
affiliates over selling products or services to ultimate users or consumers outside
of the organizations. Defendantsâ business practices also make it unlikely that
affiliates can meaningfully earn money by selling products or services to outside
customers. The FTC alleges that the defendants have taken more than $7
million from consumers, and pocketed over $1.3 million for themselves.

M.D. Fla.

(Malaysia)

7 corporate and 3 individual
defendants

Civil Lawsuit: The FTCâs complaint alleges that MOBE and its operators used
online ads, social media, and live events to sell a fraudulent business education
program to U.S. consumers â including service members, veterans, and older
adults. Defendants claimed that their program would enable consumers to start

their own online businesses and earn substantial income via internet marketing.

However, defendants eventually revealed to consumers that their âproven
systemâ for making money involved selling memberships to others in the hopes
of earning commissions on those sales. Most people who bought into the
program and paid for the expensive memberships were unable to recoup their
costs. The FIC alleged that MOBE charged consumers hundreds of millions of
dollars for its worthless business coaching products.

Civil Lawsuits: The FTCâs complaints alleged that defendants made millions of
dollars in commissions by enticing thousands of consumers to pay as much as
$60,000 for memberships to join MOBE, a scheme the FTC alleged charged
consumers hundreds of millions of dollars for worthless business coaching
products. Defendants used false claims and misleading testimonials about
how much money consumers could make. The defendants advertised on social
media, YouTube, online news sites, and at live events, specifically targeting
teenagers, students, and older consumers.

2:20-cv-00710
W.D. Wash.

(Washington)

2 corporate and 3 individual
defendants

Civil Lawsuit: The FTCâs complaint alleges that defendants targeted consumers
who were looking for ways to make money by starting retail businesses on the
Internet. The defendants found many of their targets by purchasing consumersâ
contact information from other online business coaching operations that had
already deceived the targets. Using high-pressure sales pitches, defendants
claimed their marketing assistance would drive more customers to consumersâ
online stores and drastically increase sales and earnings. Defendants often
encouraged consumers to pay them thousands of dollars by incurring credit
card debt. The complaint alleges that, in many instances, defendantsâ marketing
products and services did not increase sales or result in the promised earning of
thousands of dollars per month.

Civil Lawsuit: The FTCâs complaint alleged that Online Trading Academy and

its operators deceived consumers for years with claims that purchasers of OTAâs
investment training were likely to generate significant income. OTA allegedly
targeted older consumers with visibility to retirement age, near retirement or
retired. OTA claimed that anyone could learn to use its strategy, and filled its
sales pitch with testimonials and hypothetical trades showing significant profits.
However, the FTC alleged that OTA had no evidence that purchasers were likely
to realize the advertised profits and that the companyâs own surveys and third
party trading data showed that most purchasers made little to no money.

Civil Lawsuit: The FTCâs complaint alleges that Nudge and its operators
marketed real estate training by promising consumers, including those on
limited fixed incomes and retirees, that they would be taught a proven formula
on how to make substantial money from investing in real estate. Defendants
allegedly used real estate celebrities to market and provide credibility to their
training programs. Defendants allegedly enticed consumers to enroll in a series
of increasingly expensive training programs, ultimately taking more than $400
million from consumers. The FTC alleged that the vast majority of consumers
who paid for Nudgeâs seminars did not make any money from Defendantsâ
system, and that many consumers ended up heavily debt and lost their life
savings.

SEC v. Sotnikov et al.

(Florida)

Civil Lawsuit: The SECâs complaint charged that Sotnikov and entities he
controlled participated in a scheme to lure investors into buying fictitious
Certificates of Deposit (CDs) promoted through internet advertising and
âspoofedâ websites that mimic the actual sites of legitimate financial institutions.
According to the complaint, the scheme involved buying internet ads that
included links to phony websites claiming that the firms offering the CDs were
members of FINRA and the FDIC, and that deposits were FDIC-insured. The
complaint alleged that when investors called the phone number on the websites,
an âaccount executiveâ impersonating a real registered representative directed
investors to wire funds to so-called âclearingâ partners. These alleged clearing
partners were entities used by Sotnikov to launder and misappropriate investor
funds. Many alleged victims were older investors and retirees.

Civil Lawsuit: The SECâs complaint alleged Roger Nils-Jonas Karlsson, a

offering fraud that victimized thousands of retail investors worldwide, including
members of the Deaf, Hard of Hearing, and Hearing Loss Communities. From
November 2012 through June 2019, as alleged in the SECâs complaint, Karlsson,
using aliases and a Thailand-based company, offered and sold investments in

a fictitious âPre-funded Reversed Pension Plan,â which promised extraordinary
returns. As the complaint alleged, however, such a plan did not exist. According
to the complaint, investors transferred more than $3.5 million to Karlssonâs
company, and he misappropriated at least $1.5 million of those funds for
personal use and investment.

19 and 86% per month.

Civil Lawsuit: The CFTC complaint alleges that Evans accepted at least $10

media platforms, Walsh fraudulently marketed himself to the public as a highly
successfully forex trader who earned âaverage monthly returns of 8% - 11%â or âa

fraudulently solicited income from investors by misrepresenting the risks and
profit potential of these investments. The defendants targeted a vulnerable
population of elderly persons with little experience in precious metals. Through
their fraudulent solicitation, the defendants deceived customers into purchasing
precious metals bullion at grossly inflated prices that bore no relationship to the
prevailing market price. The overcharges averaged from 100 percent to more
than 300 percent over the prevailing market price. In the end, nearly every
customer lost the vast majority of their funds deposited with the defendants.

In the Matter of Airbit Club,

Maryland Case No. 2020-0107
(Maryland)

3 individual respondents

 

Summary Order to Cease and Desist and Order to Show Cause

The Maryland Securities Commissioner issued a Summary Order to Cease
and Desist and Order to Show Cause against Respondents regarding their
activities promoting and selling interests in an allegedly fraudulent investment
scheme called Airbit Club. The Securities Commissionerâs Order alleges that
the Respondents targeted Maryland residents who were members of the
African immigrant community, promising them returns on their investments in
a cryptocurrency trading program and from the recruitment of other members
into Airbit Club. According to the Summary Order, Ekane and Tawembe falsely
promised members that their investments in Airbit Club would double in 225
days, and that members could withdraw their investment after that time. The
Summary Order also alleges that that Millan, Tawembe, and Ekane violated
the registration, and antifraud provisions of the Maryland Securities Act. The

respondents have the right to a hearing on the allegations in the Summary Order.

Maryland Case No. 2020-0113
(New Jersey)

1 corporate and 2 individual
respondents

 

 

Summary Order to Cease and Desist and Order to Show Cause

The Maryland Securities Commissioner issued a Summary Order to Cease and
Desist and Order to Show Cause against Respondents for violating the Maryland
Franchise Law in connection with offers and sales of NYC Bagel franchises in
Maryland. The Securities Commissionerâs Order alleges that NYC Bagel is the
most recent in a series of entities that Smith and Mason used (and may continue
to be using) around the US to violate both federal and state franchise laws. In
the Summary Order, the Securities Commissioner alleges that, in 2018, and
despite being ordered in 2015 to permanently cease and desist from future
violations of the Maryland Franchise Law, Smith and Mason offered and sold a
franchise to a Maryland resident for a NYC Bagel franchise to be operated in
Washington, DC. According to the Summary Order, Smith represented to the
franchisee that his franchise fee would be refunded if he could not open his
NYC Bagel outlet, but when the Maryland franchisee failed to obtain financing
to allow him to open his NYC Bagel outlet and requested a refund, Smith and
Mason stopped corresponding with him. According to the Summary Order, in
addition to violating the registration and disclosure provisions of the Maryland
Franchise Law, NYC Bagel did not disclose to the Maryland franchisee material
information regarding Smith and Masonâs history of civil judgments and state
law enforcement orders against them, including the 2015 Maryland Final Order
to Cease and Desist. Neither Smith, Mason, nor NYC Bagel responded to the
Securities Commissionerâs Summary Order to Cease and Desist.

In the Matter of Lifestyle
Media Solutions, LLC

Maryland Case No. 2020-003
(Missouri)

1 corporate respondent

Consent Order: The Maryland Securities Commissioner entered into a Consent
Order against Lifestyle Media to resolve alleged violations of the Maryland
Franchise Law by Lifestyle in the offer and sale of publishing business franchises
in Maryland. The Consent Order alleges that between 2017 and 2020 Lifestyle
Media entered into âlicense agreementsâ with several Maryland entities to
operate community magazine businesses, and that those license agreements
constituted franchises. Lifestyle Media never registered to offer franchises under
the Maryland Franchise Law, did not provide registered disclosure documents

to prospective Maryland licensees, and did not substantiate the earnings
representations that Lifestyle posted on its website. Under the Consent Order,
in which Lifestyle Media neither admitted nor denied violating Maryland law,
Lifestyle Media agreed to register as a franchise under the Maryland Franchise
Law and make rescission offers to Maryland Licensees. Lifestyle Media paid a
$2,000 civil monetary penalty to the Maryland Attorney Generalâs Office and
subsequently filed a franchise registration with the Maryland Securities Division.

In the Matter of Burgerim
Group, USA, Inc.

Maryland Case No. 2020-003
(California)

3 individual respondents

 

 

Stop Order: On December 27, 2019, the Maryland Securities Commissioner
issued a Stop Order against Respondent, summarily suspending Burgerimâs
franchise registration in Maryland, pending a hearing. In that Stop Order, the
Securities Commissioner alleged that a franchise disclosure document that
Burgerim filed as part of its registration application in Maryland was incomplete
or inaccurate and omitted material facts about the franchise offering because
Burgerim failed to disclose that Burgerim had hired insolvency counsel to assist
in restructuring its debts, or that Burgerim appointed a Chief Restructuring
Officer. The Securities Commissioner also alleged that Burgerimâs franchise
disclosure document filed in Maryland failed to include complete contact
information, including telephone numbers, for current franchise outlets and
former franchisees. Burgerim failed to answer the Stop Order or request a
hearing. As a result, on February 5, 2020, the Securities Commissioner issued
a Final Stop Order permanently revoking Burgerimâs franchisorâs franchise
registration in Maryland.
