OPINION AND ORDER ACCEPTING OFFER OF SETTLEMENT OF STEVEN A.
COHEN

I,

On this date, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ or âCFTCâ)
issued a Notice of Intent to Revoke Registration of (âNoticeâ) Steven A. Cohen (âCohenâ or the
âRegistrantâ). The Notice alleges that Cohen is subject to suspension, revocation, or restriction
of registration pursuant to Sections 8a(3)(C) and 8a(4) of the Commodity Exchange Act (âActâ),
7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 12a (3)(C) and 12a(4). To resolve this matter, Cohen has submitted an Offer of
Settlement (âOfferâ) that the Commission has determined to accept.

Il.

Cohen acknowledges service of this Opinion and Order Accepting Offer of Settlement
(âOrderâ). To effect settlement of the matters alleged in the Notice and this Order, without
taking testimony and prior to any adjudication on any issue of fact or law by the Commission,
and without admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions in the Notice or herein,
Cohen consents to the entry of this Order and to the use of the findings in this Order only in this
proceeding and in any other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission
is a party.

 

' Cohen does not consent to the use of this Order, or the findings in this Order consented to in the Offer, as the sole
basis for any other proceeding brought by the Commission, other than in a proceeding in bankruptcy or to enforce
the terms of this Order. Nor does Cohen consent to the use of the Offer or this Order, or the findings in this Order
consented to in the Offer, by any other party in any other proceeding.
Il.
The Commission finds the following:
A. REGISTRANT

Steven A. Cohen is a resident of Greenwich, Connecticut. Cohen is the principal of, and
indirectly owns and controls, $.A.C. Capital Advisors, LLC (âSAC LLCâ) and S.A.C. Capital
Advisors, L.P. (âSAC LPâ).? Cohen also indirectly owns and controls Point72 Asset
Management, L.P. and Stamford Harbor Capital, L.P., an investment adviser registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the âSECâ). Point72 Asset Management, L.P. and certain
of its affiliates that are engaged in asset management are not registered with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission as investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 or
with the CFTC as commodity pool operators or commodity trading advisors. Cohen is registered
with the Commission as an Associated Person (âAPâ) and listed as a principal (as that term is
defined in Regulation 3.1(a), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 3.1(a)) of SAC LP.

B. FACTS

On January 8, 2016, the SEC entered an Order Making Findings and Imposing Remedial
Sanctions Pursuant to Section 203(f) of the Investment Advisors Act of 1940 (the âSEC Orderâ),
in which the SEC found that Cohen had âfailed reasonably to supervise [an employee] with a
view to preventing [that employeeâs] violation of Section 10(b) of the [Securities] Exchange Act
[of 1934] and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.â Cohen consented to the SEC Order, without admitting or
denying the findings therein. The SEC Order included a finding that Cohen ignored red flags,
failed to take prompt action to determine whether Matthew Martoma, a portfolio manager who
reported to Cohen, was engaged in unlawful insider trading conduct, and failed to take
reasonable steps to prevent violations of the federal securities laws.

IV.

LEGAL DISCUSSION

Cohen is subject to statutory disqualification under the Act. Pursuant to Section 8a(4), 7
U.S.C. Â§ 12a(4), the Commission may suspend, revoke, or place restrictions upon the registration
of any person registered under the Act if cause exists under Section 8a(3) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§
12a(3), which would warrant refusal of registration of such person.

 

? On September 16, 2014, the CFTC accepted SAC LLCâs and SAC LPâs offer of settlement and issued an order
revoking the registration of SAC LLC and restricting the registration of SAC LP pursuant to Section 8a(2)(D) of the
Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 12a(2)(D), and SAC LLCâs and SAC LPâs guilty pleas to felony wire fraud in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York. In connection with SAC LLCâs and SAC LPâs guilty pleas,
each entity admitted that at least one of its employees had engaged in insider trading within the scope of their
employment and for the benefit of the respective entity.
Section 8a(3)(C) of the Act provides that registration may be refused to any person if that
person has failed reasonably to supervise another person, who is subject to such personâs
supervision, with a view to preventing violations of, inter alia, the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 or any rule, regulation or order under that statute.

Cohen consented to the SEC Order, without admitting or denying the findings therein,
and the SEC Order included a finding by the SEC that Cohen failed reasonably to supervise
another person who was subject to Cohenâs supervision, with a view to preventing that personâs
violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.
Cohenâs failure to reasonably supervise forms a basis under Sections 8a(3)(C) and 8a(4) of the
Act for a statutory disqualification and for the Commission to suspend, revoke, or place
restrictions upon Cohenâs registration.
