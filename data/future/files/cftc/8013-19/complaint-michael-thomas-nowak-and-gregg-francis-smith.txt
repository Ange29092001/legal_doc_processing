MICHAEL THOMAS NOWAK, and GREGG
FRANCIS SMITH,

Defendants.

 

COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, CIVIL
MONETARY PENALTIES, AND OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF

Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the âCFTCâ or âCommissionââ)
alleges as follows:

I SUMMARY

1. From at least 2008 through at least 2015 (the âRelevant Periodâ), Defendants
Michael Thomas Nowak (âNowakââ) and Gregg Francis Smith (âSmithââ) (collectively,
Defendantsâ), who were traders at a major U.S. financial institution (âBank Aâ), engaged in
manipulative and deceptive acts and practices in the precious metals futures markets, which
involved Defendants placing orders for and trading precious metals futures contracts on a
registered entity. Defendants repeatedly engaged in these manipulative or deceptive acts and
practices by âspoofingâ (bidding or offering with the intent to cancel the bid or offer before
execution). In placing thousands of orders with the intention to cancel them, Defendants sent

false signals of increased buying or selling interest designed to trick market participants into
Case: 1:19-cv-06163 Document #: 1 Filed: 09/16/19 Page 2 of 29 PagelD #:1

executing the orders Defendants wanted filled. Defendants engaged in this conduct with the
intent to manipulate market prices and create artificial prices, and thereby enable their orders to
be filled sooner, at a better price, or in larger quantities than they otherwise would.

2. By virtue of this conduct, as further alleged herein, throughout the Relevant
Period, Defendants engaged in acts and practices that violated Section 9(a)(2) of the Commodity
Exchange Act (the âActââ), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13(a)(2)(2012).

3. By virtue of this conduct, as further alleged herein, from July 16, 2011, through at
least 2015, Defendants engaged in acts and practices that violated Section 4c(a)(5)(C) of the Act,
7 U.S.C. Â§ 6c(ay(5)(C) (2012).

4. By virtue of this conduct, as further alleged herein, from August 15, 2011,
through at least 2015, Defendants engaged in acts and practices that violated Section 6(c)(1) of
the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 9(1) (2012), and Commission Regulation (âRegulationâ) 180.1(a)(1) and (3),
17 C.F.R. Â§ 180.1(a)(1), (3) (2019).

5. The Commission brings this action pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C.

Â§ 13a-1 (2012), to enjoin Defendantsâ unlawful acts and practices and to compel Defendantsâ
compliance with the Act and Regulations. In addition, the Commission seeks civil monetary
penalties and other equitable relief, including but not limited to disgorgement and trading and
registration prohibitions, as the Court deems necessary and appropriate.

Hf. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

6. This Court has jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1331 (2012)
(federal question jurisdiction) and 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1345 (2012) (district courts have original
jurisdiction over civil actions commenced by the United States or by any agency expressly
authorized to sue by Act of Congress). Section 6c(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(a) (2012),

authorizes the Commission to seek injunctive relief in any proper district court of the United

2
Case: 1:19-cv-06163 Document #: 1 Filed: 09/16/19 Page 3 of 29 PagelD #:1

States against any person whenever it shall appear to the Commission that such person has
engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a violation of any
provision of the Act or any rule, regulation, or order thereunder.

7. Venue properly lies with this Court pursuant to 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-I(e), because
Defendants transact business in the Northern District of Illinois, and the acts and practices in
violation of the Act and Regulations have occurred within this District.

Hit. PARTIES

8. Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading Commission is the independent federal
regulatory agency charged by Congress with the administration and enforcement of the Act and
Regulations promulgated thereunder. One of its core responsibilities is to protect the public
interest by deterring and preventing disruptions to market integrity. See 7 U.S.C. Â§ 5(b) (2012).

9. Defendant Michael Thomas Nowak is a resident of New Jersey. Nowak has
been employed by Bank A since approximately 1996 and currently serves as managing director
and Global Head of Precious and Base Metals Trading. During the Relevant Period, Nowak was
a trader and supervisor on Bank Aâs precious metals desk and worked out of Bank Aâs New
York and London offices. Between 2015 and 2018, Nowak was listed with the National Futures
Association as a principal of an affiliate of Bank A.

10. Defendant Gregg Francis Smith is a resident of New York. Smith has been
employed by Bank A since 2008, when his previous employer (âBank Bââ) was acquired by Bank
A. During the Relevant Period, and continuing until the present, Smith has been an executive
director and trader on Bank Aâs precious metals desk, working out of Bank Aâs New York City

offices. Prior to the Relevant Period, Smith was registered with the CFTC as a floor broker.

VI. MARKET AND PRODUCT BACKGROUND
A. Fundamentals of Futures Markets and Trading

18. A futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell a commodity for delivery or cash
settlement in the future at a specified price. A futures contract traded on an exchange has
standard, non-negotiable contract specifications, such as the quality, quantity, and physical
delivery time and location for the given product. Futures contracts are used to assume or shift

price risk, and may be satisfied by cash settlement, delivery, or offset. Futures contracts are
commonly used to hedge risks or to speculate on the price of commodities.

19. The Globex electronic trading platform allows market participants to trade futures
and options, including precious metals futures listed on COMEX and NYMEX, from virtually
anywhere in the world, nearly twenty-four hours a day between 5:00 P.M. Central Time on
Sunday evening and 4:00 P.M. Central Time on Friday afternoon. (Henceforth, all times
described in this Complaint are expressed in Central Time, unless otherwise stated.)

20. An âorder,â when entered for futures trading through Globex, is an electronic
request submitted to the exchange to buy (that is, âbidââ) or sell (that is, âofferâ or âaskââ) one or
more of a specified futures contract. An order may be for a quantity of one or more contracts, or
âlots.â A traderâs order is âfilledâ or âexecutedâ when it is matched on Globex with an
âoppositeâ order (an order to buy, if the trader is selling; or vice versa) for the same price
specified by the trader or a price more favorable to the trader.

21. When a bid or offer is submitted through Globex, it becomes part of the list of
orders reflected in the âorder bookâ for a particular futures contract. Traders are able to see the
âvisibleâ portion of the order book, which consists of the aggregate quantity of orders and the
aggregate quantity of lots sought in those orders on each price level for up to ten price levels on
the buy side and for up to ten price levels on the sell side for all market participants. This visible
information about aggregate buying and selling interest in the market at different price levels
(also known as âmarket depthââ) includes only the total number of orders and the total number of
lots comprising those orders at various price levels. The identities of the traders who placed the

orders and the number of lots sought in any particular order are not visible to market participants.
Case: 1:19-cv-06163 Document #: 1 Filed: 09/16/19 Page 7 of 29 PagelD #:1

22. For example, on the buy side there may be lots available (ordered from the
highest price a market participant is willing to buy to the tenth-highest) at price levels of 100, 99,
98, 97, and so forth until reaching the tenth-highest price level at 91; and on the sell side there
may be lots available (ordered from the lowest price a market participant is willing to sell to the
tenth-lowest) at price levels of 101, 102, 103, 104, and so forth until reaching the tenth-lowest
price level at 110. The âbest-bidâ level, 100, is the highest price at which any trader is willing to
buy; and the âbest-askâ level, 101, is the lowest price at which any trader is willing to sell. The
âââbid-ask spreadâ is the difference between the best-ask and best-bid price levels; accordingly, the
bid-ask spread in the example above is | (101 less 100).

23. To illustrate, the chart below shows an example of how the first five levels of the
visible order book in the Gold futures contract at a hypothetical moment in time can be

visualized as a price ladder:

100 4 4
99 13 13
98 17 23
97 26 36
96 17 25
TOTALS: 77 101 77 86
24. An âaggressiveâ order is an order that crosses, or aggresses, the bid-ask spread.

An aggressive buy order is a bid placed at the best-ask price or higher, 1.e., an order to buy at a

price at which at least one other trader is currently willing to sell. Using the example above, with

x

a best-bid of 100 and best-ask of 101, an aggressive buy order would be placed at 101 or higher.
An aggressive sell order is an offer placed at the best-bid price or lower, 1.e., an order to sell at a
price at which at least one other trader is currently willing to buy. Continuing with the example
above, an aggressive sell order would be placed at 100 or lower.

25. A ârestingâ order, on the other hand, does not cross the bid-ask spread. A resting
buy order is a bid placed at the best-bid price or lower, i.e., an order to buy at a price that is
lower than the price that other traders are currently willing to sell. Using the example above, a
resting buy order would be placed at 100 or lower. A resting sell order is placed at the best-ask
price or higher, i.e., an order to sell at a price that is higher than the price that other traders are
currently willing to buy. Continuing with the example, a resting sell order would be placed at
101 or higher.

26. An âicebergâ order is a type of order that traders can place through Globex on
exchanges including COMEX and NYMEX. In an iceberg order, the trader divides the total
number of lots the trader wants to buy or sell into two portions: one portion is a pre-set quantity
that is visible to other market participants in the visible order book, and the other portion is the
remaining part of the order, which is not visible to other market participants (1.e., a âhiddenâ
quantity). Whenever the visible portion of such an order is filled, the same, pre-set quantity of
the remaining, hidden portion automatically becomes visible at the back of the order queue; this
process repeats until the entire order is either executed or canceled. Thus, for example, if the
trader places a fifty-lot resting iceberg order to buy at price level 100, with a visible portion
showing ten lots, only ten lots of the fifty-lot order will be part of the visible order book. The
remaining forty lots will become visible, in ten-lot increments, when the preceding ten-lot

portion of the iceberg order is executed.
Case: 1:19-cv-06163 Document #: 1 Filed: 09/16/19 Page 9 of 29 PagelD #:1

27. Traders using Globex during trading sessions when the exchange is open may
âcancelâ their orders before execution. Order âcancellationâ is the termination of a pending
order before that order is fully filled.

28. CME employs a matching algorithm to match bids and offers for execution on
Globex. In certain markets, like the precious metals futures markets on COMEX and NYMEX
at issue here, the matching algorithm applies a First-In-First-Out (âFIFOâ) priority-in-time
method to orders entered at the same price level of the order book. The first orders placed at a
price level are the first to be executed. As a general matter, if there are multiple buy orders at a
price level, the orders will be filled in the order they were placed. Orders first-in-line to be filled
at a given price level are said to be at the âfront of the queue,â and orders last-to-be-filled are
said to be at the âback of the queue.ââ As a general matter, the orders at the back of the queue
will be filled only if all of the other orders at the same price level have already been filled.

B. Fundamentals of the Precious Metals Futures Market

29. Like all commodity futures markets, the market for precious metals futures
enables producers and users of precious metals to hedge the price of those commodities. For
market participants generally, the precious metals futures market serves as a principal means for
investment in precious metalsâgold, silver, platinum, and palladiumâwhich are commonly
used by investors to diversify risk and to hedge against inflation, deflation, or currency
devaluation.

30. The gold futures contract listed on COMEX (âGold Futuresâ contract) is regularly
traded on Globex for delivery during the current calendar month, the next two calendar months,
any February, April, August, and October falling within a 23-month period, and any June and
December falling within a 72-month period beginning with the current month. One lot of the

Gold Futures contract is equal to 100 troy ounces.

9
Case: 1:19-cv-06163 Document #: 1 Filed: 09/16/19 Page 10 of 29 PagelD #:1

31. The silver futures contract listed on COMEX (âSilver Futuresâ contract) is
regularly traded on Globex for delivery during the current calendar month, the next two calendar
months, any January, March, May, and September falling within a 23-month period, and any
July and December falling within a 60-month period beginning with the current month. One lot
of the Silver Futures contract is equal to 5,000 troy ounces.

32. The platinum futures contract listed on NYMEX (âPlatinum Futuresâ contract) is
regularly traded on Globex for delivery during the current calendar month, the next two calendar
months, and any March, June, September, and December within a 15-month period beginning
with the current month. One lot of the Platinum Futures contract is equal to 50 troy ounces.

33. The palladium futures contract listed on NYMEX (âPalladium Futuresâ contract)
is regularly traded on Globex for delivery during the current calendar month, the next two
calendar months, and any March, June, September, and December falling within a 15-month
period beginning with the current month. One lot of the Palladium Futures contract is equal to
100 troy ounces.

C. Examples of Spoofing Violations in Futures Markets

34. In general, in the futures markets, when there is more interest in buying a
particular contract than there is in selling, prices will rise, all else equal; conversely, when there
is more interest to sell than to buy, prices will fall, all else equal. This general concept holds true
in the precious metals futures markets at issue here.

35. Many market participants incorporate supply and demand concepts into their
trading decisions, relying on the number of bids and offers at various price levels in the visible
order book to determine whether there is generally more interest to buy or to sell in the market at
any given time, and thus whether a corresponding price change is likely. Market participants

consider, for example, liquidity and market depthâi.e., the volume of lots and orders that make

10
tr
ee
he
âer
oe.
=
_â
wd
oo
âth
*
raw
g
g

up bids and offers in the visible order book, in total and at each price level of the order book.
These market participants also consider âorder book balanceâ or âorder book pressureââ1.e., the
ratio of lots and orders on the bid side of the market (or interest to buy) to the contracts and
orders on the offer side of the market (or interest to sell), in the visible order book, in total and at
each price level of the order book.

36. For instance, if the total number of lots and/or orders on the bid (buy) side
significantly outweighs the total number of lots and/or orders on the offer (sell) side, market
participants may reasonably believe that there is more interest to buy than to sell, and thus infer
that a price increase is likely. These market participants may then trade accordingly, and some
may attempt to buy lots before the expected price increase. In such a case, these market
participants would place aggressive orders to buy (i.e., at a higher price than the currently resting
buy orders in the market), making execution of resting sell orders more likely.

37. In considering order book balance, many of these market participants give greater
weight to orders that are closer to the best-bid or best-ask price in the visible order book, and in
particular to orders that are at the best-bid and best-ask prices.

38. Many market participants use automated trading systems that analyze the market
for these types of imbalances in the order book and use that information to make trading
decisions.

39. Spoofing (bidding or offering with the intent to cancel the bid or offer before
execution) and manipulative or deceptive trading strategies that incorporate spoofing seek to take
advantage of these market fundamentals and market participantsâ reactions to them. This might
be done, for example, by placing one or more relatively large spoof orders, or a series of spoof

orders, on the buy (or sell) side, which the trader intends to cancel before execution. In this

11
Case: 1:19-cv-06163 Document #: 1 Filed: 09/16/19 Page 12 of 29 PagelD #:1

example, the trader would place these spoof buy orders to create an order book imbalance that
would convey a false appearance that there is more interest to buy than to sell in the market, and
thus trick other market participants into believing that a corresponding price increase is likely.
The trader would do this with the intent to manipulate market prices and deceive other market
participants into trading at a time, price, or quantity they otherwise would not have, in a way that
benefits the trader. For example, in anticipation of this spoofing strategy, the trader may place
one or more resting orders (which the trader intends to execute) on the sell side of the market,
anticipating and intending that the traderâs spoof orders on the buy side will deceive other market
participants into placing aggressive orders to buy, thus moving the price and allowing the
traderâs orders to sell (which the trader intends to execute) to be executed sooner, at a better
price, or in larger quantities than they otherwise would.

VIL. DEFENDANTSâ MANIPULATIVE AND DECEPTIVE SCHEME

AO. During the Relevant Period, Defendants engaged in a manipulative and deceptive
scheme that consisted of spoofing the precious metals futures market with the intent to
manipulate market prices to benefit their positions.

A. Defendantsâ Spoofing Scheme

41. Defendantsâ spoofing conduct followed a general pattern. A Defendant would
place a relatively small resting order for precious metals futures (Sometimes an iceberg order)
that he desired to execute (âGenuine Orderâ). Before or after entering a Genuine Order, the
Defendant would, on the opposite side of the market, place a non-iceberg, relatively large resting
order that he intended to cancel before execution (âSpoof Orderâ), or alternatively would rapidly
place a series of non-iceberg resting orders that he intended to cancel before execution (âLayered
Spoof Ordersââ). Frequently, a series of Layered Spoof Orders would include orders placed at

two or more distinct price levels, and each order in the series was placed for the same number of

12
er

â3

cB

te

op

-

_â

waa
Fe

Te

â7

r

r

lots. The Defendantâs Spoof Order or some or all of his Layered Spoof Orders would be active
on the market at the same time as the Genuine Order. The Defendantâs Spoof Order or total
Layered Spoof Orders would be for a greater number of lots than the visible quantity of his
Genuine Order on the opposite side of the market, and in many instances would effect a change
to the order book balance at the applicable number of price levels. Finally, Defendants would
typically cancel their Spoof Orders within a few seconds of placement, and would typically
cancel the highest bids or lowest offers placed in a given series of Layered Spoof Orders within a
few seconds after placing them.

42. A Defendantâs goal in spoofing through this pattern of trading was to manipulate
market prices so that all or part of his Genuine Order would be filled. When a Defendant was
successful in executing his Genuine Order, he would typically cancel his Spoof Order or his
Layered Spoof Orders (particularly the Layered Spoof Orders that he placed closest to the best-
bid or best-ask in the order book) quickly after his Genuine Order was filled.

43. The following is a simplified explanation of how the scheme was intended to
work, using a hypothetical example of a Genuine Order on the sell side. A Defendant would
enter a Spoof Order on the buy side with the intent to manipulate market prices so that the
Defendantâs Genuine Order that was resting on the sell side would be executed. Specifically, the
Defendantâs large Spoof Order to buy would result in an increase in demand in the order book,
which would be visible to other market participants, impacting their trading decisions. The
Defendant intended that this Spoof Order would cause other market participants to place
aggressive orders to buy (i.e., at a higher price than the currently resting bids in the market),
making it more likely that the price would move so that the Defendantâs Genuine Order would be

executed at the price where it was resting.

13

op

_â

Fe
Te
â7
r
r

44, When Defendantsâ Genuine Orders were buy orders, their Spoof Orders or
Layered Spoof Orders were orders to sell. In placing Spoof Orders or Layered Spoof Orders to
sell, Defendants intended to manipulate market prices so that their Genuine Orders to buy would
be executed at the prices where they were resting. This was done by sending market participants
a false signal of greater supply to create the impression that the price would likely decline and
trick market participants into transacting on Defendantsâ Genuine Orders to buy at their resting
price.

45. Conversely, when Defendantsâ Genuine Orders were sell orders, their Spoof
Orders or Layered Spoof Orders were orders to buy. In placing Spoof Orders or Layered Spoof
Orders to buy, Defendants intended to manipulate market prices so that the Genuine Orders to
sell would be executed at the price where they were resting. This was done by sending market
participants a false signal of greater demand to create the impression that the price would likely
rise and trick market participants into transacting on Defendantsâ Genuine Orders to sell at their
resting price.

46. In placing Spoof Orders and Layered Spoof Orders, Defendants falsely
represented to market participants that they actually wanted to buy or sell the number of lots in
Defendantsâ orders when, in reality, they did not want to do so.

47. Defendants entered their Spoof Orders and Layered Spoof Orders to create a false
impression of buying or selling interest or order book balance and result in misinformation, with
the intent to manipulate market prices and trick market participants into trading based on
Defendantsâ spoofing. Defendants knew that their Spoof Orders and Layered Spoof Orders

would appear in the order book and that traders often considered information about order book

14
Case: 1:19-cv-06163 Document #: 1 Filed: 09/16/19 Page 15 of 29 PagelD #:1

balance when making their trading decisions. Thus, Defendants intended that their Spoof Orders
and Layered Spoof Orders would mislead other market participants.

48. Defendantsâ spoofing scheme included the placement of thousands of Spoof
Orders and Layered Spoof Orders with the intent to manipulate market prices so that their
Genuine Orders would be executed at their resting price during the Relevant Period.

B. Spoofing by Nowak

49. Nowak supervised Bank Aâs precious metals desk in New York during the
Relevant Period, supervising Smith and other traders.

50. During the Relevant Period, Nowak spoofed in the precious metals futures
markets, typically by placing Layered Spoof Orders.

51. Nowak was also aware that other Bank A precious metals traders, including
Smith, were spoofing as well.

52. Nowak placed thousands of Spoof Orders or Layered Spoof Orders during the
Relevant Period, which at the time of placement he intended to cancel before execution and
intended to manipulate market prices so that his Genuine Orders would be executed at their
resting price, including, by way of example, on the following occasions:

1. May 6, 2013: Nowak Spoofs Gold Futures

 

53. On May 6, 2013, at 9:01:13.122 a.m., Nowak placed a Genuine Order to buy five
lots of the Gold Futures contract with June 2013 expiry at a price of $1,465.90 per troy ounce,
which was the second-best bid (i.e., the second-highest bid). Approximately 1.3 seconds later,
Nowak began entering Layered Spoof Orders on the sell side of the market with the intent to
manipulate market prices so that his Genuine Order would be executed at its resting price.
Beginning at 9:01:14.497, Nowak began placing a series of offers at decreasing prices. In

approximately 2.5 seconds (between 9:01:14.497 and 9:01:16.903), Nowak placed twelve

distinct Layered Spoof Orders, each to sell five lots of Gold Futures. Nowak placed these orders
at the following prices, in sequence: $1,466.70 (twice), $1,466.60, $1,466.50, $1,466.40,
$1,466.30 (three times), $1,466.20 (twice), and $1,466.10 (twice). At 9:01:17.017âabout 100
milliseconds after Nowak had placed his twelfth Layered Spoof Order to sellâhis five-lot
Genuine Order to buy was fully filled. Over the next 230 milliseconds, Nowak placed two
additional offers at a price of $1,466.00, which was at the best-ask level, and was one tick higher
than his just-filled Genuine Order.

54. Shortly thereafter, Nowak began canceling his offers. At 9:01:17.981, Nowak
canceled his two five-lot orders with the lowest prices ($1,466.00). Over the next six seconds,
Nowak canceled his twelve Layered Spoof Orders, starting with the lowest-priced offers and
moving towards the highest-priced offers.

55. In summary, Nowak placed one bid to buy five lots, successfully purchasing all
five lots after that bid had rested in the market for approximately 3.9 seconds; and he placed
fourteen offers to sell a total of seventy lots, which he intended to cancel, and which he did
cancel without any lots being filled. At 9:01:17.017, just before his five-lot Genuine Order to
buy was filled, Nowak had twelve active Layered Spoof Orders to sell five lots eachâa twelve-
to-one ratio of offers to bids.

56. At 9:01:17.017, the sell-side market depth on the lowest eight price levels was
one hundred four lots, of which Nowak had offered sixty, and the buy-side market depth was
fifty-three lots at the eight highest price levels, including Nowakâs bid for five lots. In other
words, within eight price levels from the best bid and offer, Nowakâs orders represented 58% of
the sell-side and just 9% of the buy-side; all traders in the market besides Nowak had 9% more

bids than offers (forty-eight lots bid against forty-four lots offered); and the entire market,

16
Case: 1:19-cv-06163 Document #: 1 Filed: 09/16/19 Page 17 of 29 PagelD #:1

including Nowakâs orders, had 96% more offers than bids (one hundred four lots offered against
fifty-three lots bid).

2. October 7, 2013: Nowak Spoofs Gold Futures

 

57. On October 7, 2013, at 7:34:45.805 a.m., Nowak placed a Genuine Order to sell
five lots of the Gold Futures contract with December 2013 expiry at a price of $1,318.70 per troy
ounce, which was the second-best offer (1.e., the second-lowest offer). Approximately 1.9
seconds later, Nowak began entering Layered Spoof Orders on the buy side of the market with
the intent to manipulate market prices so that his Genuine Order would be executed at its resting
price. Beginning at 7:34:47.758, Nowak began placing a series of bids at increasing prices. In
approximately 2.8 seconds (between 7:34:47.758 and 7:34:50.523), Nowak entered fourteen
distinct Layered Spoof Orders, each to buy five lots of Gold Futures. Nowak placed these orders
at the following prices, in sequence: $1,318.00, $1,318.10, $1,318.20 (three times), $1,318.30
(twice), $1,318.40 (three times), and $1,318.50 (four times). Less than one millisecond after
Nowak had placed his fourteenth Layered Spoof Order to buy, his five-lot Genuine Order to sell
was fully filled.

58. About 900 milliseconds later, Nowak began canceling his resting bids. At
7:34:5 1.429, Nowak canceled his four highest-priced bids. Over the next several seconds,
Nowak canceled each of his ten remaining Layered Spoof Orders, starting with the highest-
priced bids and moving towards the lowest-priced bids.

59. In summary, Nowak placed one offer to sell five lots, successfully selling all five
lots after that offer had rested in the market for 4.7 seconds; and he placed fourteen orders to buy
a total of seventy lots, which he intended to cancel, and which he did cancel without any lots

being filled. At 7:34:50.523, just before his five-lot Genuine Order to sell was filled, Nowak had

17
Case: 1:19-cv-06163 Document #: 1 Filed: 09/16/19 Page 18 of 29 PagelD #:1

fourteen active Layered Spoof Orders to buy five lots eachâa fourteen-to-one ratio of bids to
offers. Each of Nowakâs highest-priced bids, at $1,318.50, was canceled less than 1.6 seconds
after being placed.

60. At 7:34:50.523, the buy-side market depth at the highest six price levels was one
hundred thirty-six lots, of which Nowak had bid seventy, and the sell-side market depth at the six
lowest price levels was fifty-three lots, including Nowakâs five-lot offer. In other words, within
six price levels from the best bid and offer, Nowakâs orders represented 51% of the buy-side and
just 9% of the sell-side; all traders in the market besides Nowak had 38% more bids than offers
(sixty-six lots bid against forty-eight lots offered); and the entire market, including Nowakâs
orders, had 157% more bids than offers (one hundred thirty-six lots bid against fifty-three lots
offered).

3. March 3, 2014: Nowak Spoofs Gold Futures

 

61. On March 3, 2014, at 8:02:17.997 a.m., Nowak placed a Genuine Order to sell
five lots of the Gold Futures contract with April 2014 expiry at a price of $1,348.20 per troy
ounce, which was the best-ask price. Approximately 1.3 seconds later, Nowak began entering
Layered Spoof Orders on the buy side of the market with the intent to manipulate market prices
so that his Genuine Order would be executed at its resting price. Beginning at 8:02:19.360,
Nowak began placing a series of bids at increasing prices. In approximately 2.2 seconds
(between 8:02:19.360 and 8:02:21.529), Nowak placed six distinct Layered Spoof Orders, each
to buy five lots of Gold Futures. Nowak placed these bids at the following prices, in sequence:
$1,347.90, $1,348.00, and $1,348.10 (four times). Less than one millisecond after Nowak had

placed his sixth Layered Spoof Order to buy, his five-lot Genuine Order to sell was fully filled.

18
Case: 1:19-cv-06163 Document #: 1 Filed: 09/16/19 Page 19 of 29 PagelD #:1

62. About 700 milliseconds later, Nowak began canceling his resting bids. At
8:02:22.257, Nowak canceled his four highest-priced bids. Over the next three seconds, he
canceled his two remaining Layered Spoof Orders, starting with the higher-priced bid.

63. In summary, Nowak placed one offer to sell five lots, successfully selling all five
lots after that offer had rested in the market for approximately 3.5 seconds; and he placed six
orders to buy a total of thirty lots, which he intended to cancel, and which he did cancel without
any lots being filled. At 8:02:21.529, just before his five-lot Genuine Order to sell was filled,
Nowak had six active Layered Spoof Orders to buy five lots eachâa six-to-one ratio of bids to
offers. The last of Nowakâs highest-priced bids, entered at $1,348.10, was canceled less than one
second after being placed.

64. At 8:02:21.529, the buy-side market depth at the highest three price levels was
sixty-five lots, of which Nowak had bid thirty, and the sell-side market depth at the three lowest
price levels was thirty-six lots, including Nowakâs five-lot offer. In other words, within three
price levels from the best bid and offer, Nowakâs orders represented 46% of the buy-side and just
14% of the sell-side; all traders in the market besides Nowak had 13% more bids than offers
(thirty-five lots bid against thirty-one lots offered); and the entire market, including Nowakâs
orders, had 81% more bids than offers (sixty-five lots bid against thirty-six lots offered).

C. Spoofing by Smith

65. Throughout the Relevant Period, Smith was employed as a precious metals trader
at Bank A.
66. During the Relevant Period, Smith spoofed in the precious metals futures markets,

typically by placing Layered Spoof Orders.
67. Smith taught other traders at Bank A and Bank B how to spoof using Layered

Spoof Orders.
19
Case: 1:19-cv-06163 Document #: 1 Filed: 09/16/19 Page 20 of 29 PagelD #:1

68. Smith explained to one trader at Bank A that placing spoof orders of a sufficient
size would enable him to move the market, and instructed him to âshow sizeâ in placing spoof
orders.

69. Smith was known on Bank A and Bank Bâs precious metals desks for his ability
to rapidly place and cancel Layered Spoof Orders.

70. In July 2017, following an investigation, the COMEX Business Conduct
Committee found that, in July and August 2013, Smithâs Gold Futures trading âemployed a
trading strategy that consisted of frequently entering and cancelling a series of ordersâ for
improper purposes ârather than to execute tradesââ1.e., placing and cancelling Layered Spoof
Ordersâin violation of exchange rules against âdishonorable or uncommercial conductâ that is
âinconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade.â

71. Smith placed thousands of Spoof Orders or Layered Spoof Orders during the
Relevant Period, which at the time of placement he intended to cancel before execution, and
intended to manipulate market prices so that his Genuine Order would be executed at its resting
price, including, by way of example, on the following occasions:

1. January 25, 2013: Smith Spoofs Silver Futures

 

72. On January 25, 2013, at 7:55:28.841 a.m., Smith placed a Genuine Order to sell
two lots of the Silver Futures contract with March 2013 expiry at a price of $31.590 per troy
ounce, which was the best-ask price. Approximately 0.6 seconds later, Smith began entering
Layered Spoof Orders on the buy side of the market with the intent to manipulate market prices
so that his Genuine Order would be executed at its resting price. Beginning at 7:55:29.473,
Smith began placing a series of bids at increasing prices. In approximately half a second

(between 7:55:29.473 and 7:55:29.985), Smith entered four distinct Layered Spoof Orders, each

to buy ten lots of Silver Futures. Smith placed these orders at the following prices, in sequence:
$31.575, $31.580 (twice), and $31.585. Three milliseconds after Smith had placed his fourth
Layered Spoof Order to buy, his two-lot Genuine Order to sell was fully filled. Over the next
318 milliseconds, Smith placed two additional ten-lot bids at $31.585, which was at this time the
second-best bid.

73. Shortly thereafter, Smith began canceling his resting bids. At 7:55:30.676, Smith
canceled his three ten-lot orders with the highest prices ($31.585). Over the next 600
milliseconds, he canceled his three remaining Layered Spoof Orders, starting with the higher-
priced bids.

74. In summary, Smith placed one offer to sell two lots, successfully selling both lots
after that offer had rested in the market for approximately 1.1 seconds; and he placed six bids to
buy a total of sixty lots, which he intended to cancel, and which he did cancel without any lots
being filled. At 7:55:29.987, just before his two-lot Genuine Order to sell was filled, Smith had
four active Layered Spoof Orders to buy ten lots eachâa twenty-to-one ratio of offers to bids.
Each of Smithâs highest-priced bids, at $31.585, was canceled less than 0.7 seconds after being
placed.

75. At 7:55:29.987, the buy-side market depth at the highest three price levels was
fifty-eight lots, of which Smith had bid forty, and the sell-side market depth at the three lowest
price levels was eighteen lots, including Smithâs two-lot offer. In other words, within three price
levels from the best bid and offer, Smith orders represented 69% of the buy-side and just 11% of
the sell-side; all traders in the market besides Smith had 13% more bids than offers (eighteen lots
bid against sixteen lots offered); and the entire market, including Smithâs orders, had 222% more

bids than offers (fifty-eight lots bid against eighteen lots offered).

2. May 23, 2013: Smith Spoofs Gold Futures

 

76. On May 23, 2013, at 2:00:22.820 p.m., Smith placed a Genuine Order to buy two
lots of the Gold Futures contract with June 2013 expiry at a price of $1,391.00 per troy ounce,
which was the best-bid. Over six seconds later, Smith began entering Layered Spoof Orders on
the sell side of the market with the intent to manipulate market prices so that his Genuine Order
would be executed at its resting price. Beginning at 2:00:29.414, Smith began placing a series of
offers at decreasing prices. In approximately 0.8 seconds (between 2:00:29.414 and
2:00:30.229), Smith entered six distinct Layered Spoof Orders, each to sell ten lots of Gold
Futures. Smith placed those offers at the following prices, in sequence: $1,391.70, $1,391.40,
$1,391.20, and $1,391.10 (three times). At 2:00:30.282 p.m.âabout sixty milliseconds after
Smith had placed his sixth Layered Spoof Order to sellâone lot of Smithâs two-lot bid was
filled. One millisecond after that, the other lot of Smithâs two-lot bid was filled.

77. About half a second later, at 2:00:30.792, Smith began canceling his resting
offers, starting with the lowest-priced offers and moving toward the highest-priced offers.
Within 0.7 seconds after his Genuine Order was fully filled, he had canceled four of his six ten-
lot Layered Spoof Orders, and canceled the remaining two Layered Spoof Orders in the next 1.2
seconds.

78. In summary, Smith placed one bid to buy two lots, successfully purchasing both
lots after that bid had rested in the market for approximately 7.5 seconds; and he placed six
offers to sell a total of sixty lots, which he intended to cancel, and which he did cancel without
any lots being filled. At 2:00:30.283, just before the second lot of his two-lot Genuine Order to

buy was filled, Smith had six active Layered Spoof Orders to sell ten lots eachâa sixty-to-one

22
Case: 1:19-cv-06163 Document #: 1 Filed: 09/16/19 Page 23 of 29 PagelD #:1

ratio of offers to bids. Each of Smithâs lowest-priced offers, at $1,391.10, was canceled less than
0.9 seconds after being placed.

79. At 2:00:30.283, the sell-side market depth at the seven lowest price levels was
one hundred six lots, of which Smith had offered sixty, and the buy-side market depth at the
seven highest price levels was forty-one lots, including one remaining lot of Smithâs two-lot bid.
In other words, within seven price levels from the best bid and offer, Smithâs orders represented
57% of the sell-side and just 2% of the buy-side; all traders in the market besides Smith had 15%
more offers that bids (forty-six lots offered against forty lots bid); and the entire market,
including Smithâs orders, had 159% more offers than bids (one hundred six lots offered against
forty-one lots bid).

3. June 1], 2015: Smith Spoofs Gold Futures

 

80. On June 11, 2015, at 7:31:25.410 a.m., Smith placed a Genuine Order to sell ten
lots of the Gold Futures contract with August 2015 expiry at a price of $1,177.80 per troy ounce,
which was the best-ask price. About 0.7 seconds later, Smith began entering Layered Spoof
Orders on the buy side of the market with the intent to manipulate market prices so that his
Genuine Order would be executed at its resting price. Beginning at 7:31:26.144, Smith began
placing a series of bids at increasing prices. In approximately 0.7 seconds (between 7:31:26.144
and 7:31:26.882), Smith entered five distinct Layered Spoof Orders, each to buy ten lots of Gold
Futures. Smith placed these orders at the following prices, in sequence: $1,177.50 (twice) and
$1,177.60 (three times). About 0.1 seconds after Smith had placed his fifth Layered Spoof Order

to buy, his ten-lot Genuine Order to sell was fully filled.

23
Case: 1:19-cv-06163 Document #: 1 Filed: 09/16/19 Page 24 of 29 PagelD #:1

81. About 0.2 seconds later, Smith began canceling his resting bids. At 7:31.27.265,
Smith canceled his three highest-priced bids, and at 7:31:27.441, he canceled his two remaining
Layered Spoof Orders.

82. In summary, Smith placed one offer to sell ten lots, successfully selling all ten lots
after that offer had rested in the market for over 1.5 seconds; and he placed five orders to buy a
total of fifty lots, which he intended to cancel, and which he did cancel without any lots being
filled. At 7:31:27.003, just before his ten-lot Genuine Order to sell was filled, Smith had five
active Layered Spoof Orders to buy ten lots eachâa five-to-one ratio of bids to offers. Each of
Smithâs bids was canceled between approximately 0.4 and 1.3 seconds after being placed.

83. At 7:31:27.003, the buy-side market depth at the highest three price levels was
seventy lots, of which Smith had bid fifty, and the sell-side market depth at the three lowest price
levels was forty-six lots, including Smithâs ten-lot offer. In other words, within three price levels
from the best bid and offer, Smithâs orders represented 71% of the buy-side and just 22% of the
sell-side; all traders in the market besides Smith had 80% more offers than bids (thirty-six lots
offered against twenty lots bid); and the entire market, including Smithâs orders, had 52% more
bids than offers (seventy lots bid against forty-six lots offered).
