ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTION 6(c) AND (d) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, MAKING
FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

I. INTRODUCTION

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionââ) has reason to believe that
at various times from at least December 31, 2012 to the present (the âRelevant Periodââ), Bank of
Nova Scotia (âRespondentâ or âBNSâ) violated Sections 4s(f)(1)(C), 4s(g)(1) and (3), 4s(h)(1),
and 6(c)(2) of the Commodity Exchange Act (âActâ), 7 U.S.C. 8Â§ 6s(f)C1)(C), 6s(g)(1), (3),
6s(h)(1), 9(2) (2018), and Commission Regulations (âRegulationsâ) 23.431(a)(3), 23.201(a)(1),
23.202(a)(1), 23.402(b), 23.602(a), 1.31(d)(3)(), and 3.3(e), 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 23.431(a)(3),
23.201(a)(1), 23.202(a)(1), 23.402(b), 23.602(a), 1.31(d)(3) Ci), 3.3(e) (2019). Therefore, the
Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest that public administrative
proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted to determine whether Respondent engaged in the
violations set forth herein and to determine whether any order should be issued imposing
remedial sanctions.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Respondent has
submitted an Offer of Settlement (âOfferâ), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Without admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, Respondent consents to
the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 6(c) and 6(d) of the
Commodity Exchange Act, Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (âOrderââ) and
acknowledges service of this Order.'

Il. FINDINGS

The Commission finds the following:
A. SUMMARY

During the Relevant Period, BNS failed to supervise its swap dealer activities diligently,
leading to numerous violations of Section 4s of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6s (2018), and to its base
metals * desk regularly failing to comply with the swap dealer business conduct standards and
recordkeeping requirements set forth in Part 23 of the Commissionâs Regulations, 17 C.F.R. pt.
23 (2019). BNSâs counterparty onboarding process, recordkeeping, and Chief Compliance
Officer reporting also failed to comply with the Act and Commission Regulations at times during
the Relevant Period. Further, BNS was unable to respond to certain requests for required records
made by the Commissionâs Division of Enforcement (the âDivisionâ or âDOEââ) and made false
or misleading statements to Division staff during the Divisionâs investigation. BNS did not
adequately remediate its non-compliant practices for many months after it became aware of the
Divisionâs investigation, and BNS has only recently begun to remediate certain of the issues.

Swap dealers such as BNS must comply with certain external business conduct standards,
including providing pre-trade disclosure of the swap dealerâs material incentives and conflicts of
interest related to a swap. These include disclosing to potential counterparties the mid-market
mark of a swap prior to consummating a swap transaction. The so-called pre-trade mid-market
mark (ââPTMMMââ) must exclude any amounts for profit, credit reserve, hedging, funding,
liquidity, or any other costs or adjustments. By making such disclosures, swap dealers inform
their counterparties of an approximate measure of the objective value of a swap prior to markup
being added by the swap dealer. Regularly from around May 2013 through the end of 2017, and
then at times through at least the end of 2019, BNSâs swap dealer desks provided counterparties
with PTMMMs that were inaccurate, untimely, or both, or failed to provide a PTMMM entirely,
affecting tens of thousands of swaps. This conduct had the effect of concealing BNSâs full
markup from its swaps counterparties and violated Section 4s(h)(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.

Â§ 6s(h)(1) (2018), and Regulation 23.431(a), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 23.431(a) (2019).

 

' Respondent consents to the use of the findings of fact and conclusions of law in this Order in this proceeding and
in any other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party or claimant, and agrees
that they shall be taken as true and correct and be given preclusive effect therein, without further proof. Respondent
does not consent, however, to the use of this Order, or the findings or conclusions herein, as the sole basis for any
other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party or claimant, other than: a
proceeding in bankruptcy or receivership; a proceeding to enforce the terms of this Order; or a statutory
disqualification proceeding pursuant to Section 8a(2), (3) and (4), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 12a(2), (3), (4) (2018), and in
accordance with Paragraph 3 of the undertakings in this Order. BNS does not consent to the use of the Offer or this
Order, or the findings or conclusions in this Order, by any other party in any other proceeding.

2 : : : : :
Base metals include aluminum, copper, lead, nickel, tin, and zinc.
From around May 2013 through at least late 2019, BNS also failed to comply with
recordkeeping requirements for PTMMMs under the Act and Regulation. BNS had records of
PTMMMs in the emails, chats messages, and audio recordings in which the PTMMMs had been
communicated to counterparties. It did not, however, keep comprehensive records and did not
keep its records in a manner searchable by transaction and counterparty. See Section 4s(g),
7U.S.C. Â§ 6s(g) (2018); Regulations 23.201(a)(1), 23.202(a)(1), 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 23.201(a)C1);
23.202(a)(1) (2019). Because of these recordkeeping failures, when Division staff sought BNSâs
PTMMM records, BNS could not produce them to the Division promptly upon request, in
violation of Regulation 1.31(d)(3)@i), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.31(d)(3) Gi) (2019).

BNSâs recordkeeping failures were not limited to PTMMMs. At the outset of its
investigation, Division staff sent BNS a document preservation notice that required BNS to
preserve, among other things, audio recordings of its base metals personnel telephone lines.
After Division staff requested production of the audio recordings, BNS informed Division staff
that it was unable to make a complete production because certain of the recordings had been
deleted. Separately, BNS failed to provide a complete production of other audio recordings
subject to a Division request for over eight months due to its inability to locate a full set of the
recordings. These recordkeeping failures violated Sections 4s(f) and (g) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.

Â§ 6s(f), (g) (2018), and Regulations 23.201(a)(1), 23.202(a)(1), and 1.31(d)(3)(i), 17 C.F.R.
Â§Â§ 23.201 (a)C1), 23.202(a)(1), 1.31(d)(3) Gi) (2019).

BNS also made statements to Division staff during the course of the Divisionâs
investigation that BNS knew or reasonably should have known were false or misleading
concerning: (i) whether it had preserved all requested audio recordings; and (11) who supervised
its New York base metals desk in late 2017. Each of these false or misleading statements
impeded the Divisionâs ability to investigate BNSâs compliance failures, and violated Section
6(c)(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 9(2) (2018).

Further, after being on notice of certain problems with its onboarding process, BNS failed
to implement policies and procedures reasonably designed to obtain and record facts concerning
whether its counterparties were U.S. persons. Among other things, these facts were needed to
determine whether BNS was subject to PTMMM disclosure requirements. BNS therefore violated
Regulation 23.402(b), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 23.402(b) (2019).

BNS also failed to comply with chief compliance officer reporting requirements.
Although BNS was aware of significant weaknesses in its trade surveillance program, BNSâs
disclosures in its 2017 Chief Compliance Officer Annual Report (2017 CCO Reportâ) failed to
adequately describe those issues, in violation of Regulation 3.3(e), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 3.3(e) (2019).

** ** **

In accepting BNSâs offer, the Commission notes that although BNS took some
cooperative steps during the course of the Divisionâs investigation, it also engaged in conduct
that impeded the Divisionâs investigation. BNSâs conduct resulted in certain charges in this
Order, including failing to preserve audio recordings and making false statements to Division
staff. BNS also provided untimely, inaccurate, and incomplete responses to Division requests for
documents and information, which required Division staff to expend resources to identify gaps
and errors and then pursue BNS to provide complete and accurate responses. Further, BNS has
only recently begun to remediate certain of its non-compliant practices despite having been on
notice of serious compliance failures and weaknesses and of the Divisionâs investigation for
some time.

B. RESPONDENT

The Bank of Nova Scotia is a chartered schedule I bank on the Bank Act (Canada),
headquartered in Toronto, Canada. BNS has been provisionally registered with the Commission
as a Swap Dealer since December 31, 2012. BNS maintains offices in, among other places, New
York, New York, and Houston, Texas.

C. FACTS

1. BNS Failed to Provide Accurate or Timely Pre-Trade Mid-Market Marks, or
Failed to Provide Marks at All, and BNSâs Records of Its Swaps
Transactions Failed to Meet Commission Requirements

Section 4s(h) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6s(h) (2018), sets forth certain business conduct
standards for swap dealers. These standards include requirements that swap dealers disclose to
counterparties: (1) information about the material characteristics of the swap to be traded; (2)
the swap dealerâs material incentives and conflicts of interest related to the swap; and (3) a daily
mark of each uncleared swap transaction.

Regulation 23.431, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 23.431 (2019), implements some of the disclosure requirements
of Section 4s(h). Pursuant to Regulation 23.431(a), swap dealers must disclose to
counterparties,â â[a]t a reasonably sufficient time prior to entering into a swap,â among other
things: (1) the material characteristics of the particular swap, âwhich shall include the material
economic terms of the swap, the terms relating to the operation of the swap, and the rights and
obligations of the parties during the term of the swapâ; and (2) the material incentives and
conflicts of interest the swap dealer may have in connection with the swap, which shall include
[with respect to disclosure of the price of the swap, the price of the swap and the mid-market
mark of the swap.â

Regulation 23.431(d)(2) instructs swap dealers that pre-trade mid-market marks âshall
not include amounts for profit, credit reserve, hedging, funding, liquidity, or any other costs or
adjustments.â* The Commission has noted that the term mid-market âhas been used by many

 

* Both Section 4s(h)(3)(B) and Regulation 23.43 1(a) limit the disclosure requirements discussed in this Order to
counterparties who are not swap dealers, major swap participants, security-based swap dealers, or major security-
based swap participants. The Commission has expressed the view that, for non-U.S.-based swap dealers such as
BNS, Regulation 23.431(a) will generally apply under CEA Section 2(1), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(i), to swaps trades made with
counterparties located within the United States. See Interpretive Guidance and Policy Statement Regarding
Compliance with Certain Swap Regulations, 78 Fed. Reg. 45,292, 45,351 (July 26, 2013). This Order will use the
general term âcounterpartiesâ to refer to counterparties that fall within the scope of the Act and Regulations.

* The Commission considered, but ultimately did not require, swap dealers to disclose their profit separately.
Business Conduct Standards for Swap Dealers and Major Swap Participants with Counterparties (âProposed Rule
Releaseââ), 75 Fed. Reg. 80,638, 80,645 (Dec. 22, 2010).
industry participants since at least 1994,â and characterized the mid-market mark as an

âobj ectiveâÂ® and âtransparentâ value. Because the mid-market mark requirement was a
âprinciples basedâ rule, the Commission declined to âendorse any particular methodologyâ of
calculating the mark.Â®

a. Failures to Comply with Business Conduct Standards for Pre-Trade
Mid-Market Marks

Regularly from around May 2013 through the end of 2017, and at times through at least
the end of 2019, BNS swap dealer desks provided counterparties PTMMMs that were inaccurate,
untimely, or both, or failed to provide a PTMMM entirely. These failures had the effect of
concealing BNSâs full markup from counterparties for tens of thousands of swaps. Around late
2018, BNS began to improve its compliance with PTMMM requirements, but BNS still engaged
in certain noncompliant practices through at least the end of 2019.

The BNS base metals deskâs PTMMM compliance failures are representative of similar
failures that occurred on other BNS trading desks. From around May 2013 through at least the
end of 2017, BNSâs base metals traders and salespeople provided counterparties PTMMMs that
failed to inform the counterparties of the full trading and sales markups included in its prices. In
a typical example of this conduct, a counterparty would approach a base metals salesperson to
request BNS offer to sell it some number of three-month aluminum forward swaps. The
salesperson would then relay the request to a trader, who would provide a price that included a
trading markup. On top of that price, the salesperson would add additional dollars of sales
markup before quoting the offer to the counterparty. When the counterparty accepted the price,
the salesperson would then disclose a PTMMM that was only one dollar less than the agreed-
upon price. In this instance and numerous others like it, BNSâs PTMMM was inaccurate
because it did not exclude all costs and adjustmentsâonly one dollar of themâand it had the
effect of understating the full markup added by both the salesperson and the trader.

BNS also provided inaccurate PTMMMs in instances where it did not sufficiently train
its personnel to provide accurate marks. For example, one member of BNSâs base metals desk
(âSalesperson 1â) had provided PTMMMs to counterparties for complex options transactions,
including zero-cost collar transactions,â since approximately November 2016. Yet, ina
December 2017 recorded telephone call with a supervisor, Salesperson | indicated that he did
not understand how to calculate a PTMMM for a zero-cost collar transaction and that he
âalwaysâ âjust kind of stuck random stuff inâ for the PTMMM.

Releaseââ), 77 Fed. Reg. 9,734, 9,768 (Feb. 17, 2012).

Â° Id.
â Proposed Rule Release, 75 Fed. Reg. at 80,646.
* Final Rule Release, 77 Fed. Reg. at 9,768.

â A zero cost collar is an options strategy by which a trader purchases a call (put) option while simultaneously
selling a put (call) option, with equal and offsetting premiums. The strategy is typically used to hedge against the
price volatility of the underlying asset.
For at least one thousand base metals trades between April 2017 and December 2017
alone, BNS provided an inaccurate PTMMM. By providing inaccurate PTMMMs that
understated its full mark up on swaps, BNS prevented counterparties from being able to assess
swap valuations fully before making trading decisions.

With respect to timeliness, from 2013 through at least late 2018, and occasionally
thereafter, BNSâs base metals desk also failed to provide PTMMMs to counterparties at a
reasonably sufficient time prior to entering into a swap. The common practice for BNSâs base
metals desk was to provide a PTMMM after it and its counterparty had agreed to transact. In
numerous instances, BNS provided a PTMMM seconds, minutes, or hours after a transaction was
consummated. As a result, for the vast majority of the 20,000 base metals swaps BNS executed
from 2013 through late 2018 where BNS provided a PTMMM,, it failed to provide a PTMMM
sufficiently prior to entering into a swap. Thus, even if BNS provided a counterparty an accurate
PTMMM,, it still effectively concealed its full markup from counterparties until after a trade was
done.

Finally, from 2013 through at least 2019, BNS failed to provide counterparties with
PTMMMs at all for up to 4,300 base metals swaps.â In numerous instances, BNSâs
communications with a counterparty concerning a transaction do not contain a PTIMMM
disclosure.

b. Failures to Keep Records of Pre-Trade Mid-Market Marks as
Required by the Act and Commission Regulations

During the Relevant Period, BNS also failed to keep records as required of the PTMMMs
provided to counterparties by all of its trading desks. Under the Act and Regulations, swap
dealers must keep daily trading records such as PTMMMs in a form and manner identifiable and
searchable by transaction and counterparty. See Section 4s(g), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6s(g) (2018);
Regulations 23.201(a)(1), 23.202(a)(1), 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 23.201(a)(1); 23.202(a)(1) (2019). Swap
dealers must also be able to produce required records such as PTMMMs to the Commission
âpromptlyâ upon request. See Regulation 1.31(d)(3)(i1), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.31(d)(3) G0).

During the Relevant Period, BNS had records of PTMMMs it provided to counterparties
in one or more of the following places, depending on the transaction: (1) email mailboxes and
archives for written electronic communications (such as emails and chat messages) for its
personnel who provided PTMMMss in such form; (2) repositories of audio recordings for its
personnel who provided PTMMMs over the telephone, and for some trades; and (3) a BNS email
mailbox that collected PTMMM records for all BNS trading desks (the âDodd-Frank Mailboxââ).

During the regular course of business, BNS traders and salespersons who provided
counterparties PTMMMs in emails or chat messages often did not include unique transaction
identifiers or full counterparty names in those same communications. Since 2013, BNS policy
required that for any PTMMM provided orally over the telephone, an email must be sent to the
Dodd-Frank Mailbox reflecting the PTMMM provided. BNS had internal guidance suggesting

 

'Â° As discussed further below, in some instances, BNS may have failed to keep a record of a PTMMM that was
provided due to its poor recordkeeping practices.
that emails to the Dodd-Frank Mailbox should include the tradeâs transaction number and
counterparty name, but the guidance was not mandatory, and throughout the Relevant Period,
BNS personnel often failed to include those details in their emails. In November 2017, BNS
expanded its policy to require an email containing the PTMMM to be sent to the Dodd-Frank
Mailbox for all transactions. Even after that point, however, BNS salespersons and traders
frequently failed to send the requisite email for every trade.

BNSâs recordkeeping system for PTMMMs did not permit it to produce PPMMM
records to the Commission promptly upon request. BNSâs Dodd-Frank Mailbox did not contain
a comprehensive record of PTMMMs provided to counterparties and was not searchable by
transaction number or counterparty name for all transactions for the reasons above. BNSâs
emails, chat messages, and audio recordings that contained PTMMMs likewise were not
searchable by transaction number or counterparty name for all transactions. Moreover, BNS did
not record, in transaction data or otherwise, the name of the base metals trader or salesperson that
communicated with the counterparty for any particular trade.'' As a result, when Division staff
requested production of the PTMMMs provided to four counterparties over several years, BNS
took almost five months to produce a response, which it represented was complete. BNS could
not, however, represent that it had provided the PTMMM for every transaction with the four
counterparties because it had not connected the communications containing PTMMMs to
particular transactions. When BNS did finally attempt to connect its PTIMMM communications
with its transaction records, its shoddy recordkeeping resulted in BNS admitting that it was
unable to âconclusively tieâ all the PTMMMs it had identified to the specific transactions to
which the marks pertained.

BNSâs supervision of its PTMMM recordkeeping was insufficient. Since 2013, BNS
conducted an annual test of its compliance with CFTC pre-trade execution requirements. Every
year, the test concluded that BNSâs process for collecting pre-trade records was âmanually
intensiveâ and âmay not be scalable in the event the CFTC requests a much largerâ number of
records than had been tested. Yet BNS did not take any steps to improve its recordkeeping
system until late 2017, and even then did not take adequate steps. BNSâs recordkeeping
oversight also failed to detect non-compliance with its recordkeeping policies. These
supervision failures contributed to BNS being unable to produce, for base metals transactions
alone, PTMMM records for nearly 15% of the over 25,000 swaps subject to Regulation 23.431
from May 2013 through December 2019. The percentage of PTMMMs it failed to record is over
19% if limited to the period prior to November 2017, when BNS expanded its use of the Dodd-
Frank Mailbox.

Cc. Failure to Supervise the Base Metals Desk and PTMMM Compliance

BNSâs supervision of its base metals desk generally, and of PTMMM compliance
specifically, was lax. Although BNS provided supervisors general guidance, such as stating that

 

'! BNS also failed to keep complete records of PTMMMs for swaps executed over Trading Platform 1, a trading
platform that BNS base metals personnel used during the Relevant Period. For trades conducted over Trading
Platform 1 where BNS provided its counterparty a PTMMM via the platform itself at the time of the trade, BNS did
not retain a record of the PTMMM provided unless the BNS trader or salesperson took a screenshot at the time of
the trade, which did not always happen.
they were responsible for âmonitoring each traderâ for compliance with business conduct
standards, BNS did not have supervisory procedures for conducting such monitoring or attesting
that it had occurred. Base metals supervisors also failed to recognize and stop noncompliant
behavior. As noted above, after Salesperson 1 admitted to a supervisor that he âalwaysâ âjust
kind of stuck random stuff inâ for PTMMMs, the supervisor provided a PTMMM for the specific
trade but did not inquire any further or arrange for extra training, or report the issue to other

supervisors or compliance.

Although BNS had some written policies, procedures, or guidance addressing PTMMMs,
they lacked detail and were not consistently followed. BNS also failed to provide effective
training on PTMMMs. For example, BNS training materials as far back as 2014 emphasized that
PTMMMs should be given âprior toâ entering into a swap, yet for years BNS personnel provided
PTMMMs after a trade was done. BNSâs PTMMM controls were also ineffective. As of May
2020, BNS had no controls at all to validate the accuracy of PTMMMs, and BNS only instituted
a control for PTMMM timeliness in April 2019.'* BNS compliance also failed to detect its
PTMMM control weaknesses, despite conducting a review aimed specifically at doing so.'? Asa
result, BNS failed to detect widespread noncompliance with PTMMM requirements for an
extended period of time.

Moreover, BNS knew in May 2018 of concerns about PTMMMs from a former base
metals supervisor. Yet even after BNS was aware of the Divisionâs investigation, BNS
continued to fail to remediate its PTMMM compliance deficiencies promptly. Through the end
of 2018, BNS personnel consistently provided PTMMMs in an untimely manner, and through
the end of 2019, BNS still had instances of PTMMMS that were either not given or not recorded.

BNSâs systemic supervision failures, including inadequate supervisory oversight,
ineffective policies, procedures, and training, and weak controls affected PTMMM compliance
across the swap dealer and resulted in compliance failures by other desks. For example, in
March 2020, BNS informed Division staff that its rates swap desk had misunderstood PTMMM
requirements for an unknown number of cleared swaps and that its control for confirming that
PTMMMss were provided for all in-scope transactions had failed to take into account cleared
swaps.

2. BNS Swap Dealer Supervision Failures Extended to Its Audio Recordkeeping
Obligations

BNSâs lack of supervision was not limited to its PTMMM practices. In accordance with
Commission Regulations, BNSâs policies require the maintenance of required audio recordings
for a period of one year. Regulation 1.31(b)(2), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.31(b)(2) (2019) (âA records entity

 

'? Although BNS had a control since at least November 2017 to confirm a PTMMM was provided for every in-
scope trade, the control failed to do so for reasons BNS was unable to determine.

'S In November 2017, BNS compliance began a review to test its PTMMM controls in light of the Commissionâ s
enforcement action, Jn re Cargill, CFTC No. 18-03, 2017 WL 5188245 (Nov. 6, 2017). That review did not identify
any deficiencies with BNSâs PTMMM controls. Another review referred to as the âCargill assessmentâ took over
nine months to conclude, in September 2018, that BNS had no control to validate whether its PTMMMs were
accurate.
that is required to retain oral communications, shall keep regulatory records of oral
communications for a period of not less than one year from the date of such communication.â).
BNSâs procedures dictated that its technology infrastructure automatically deleted audio
recordings made more than one year prior, unless such recordings are subject to, for example, a
litigation hold.

a. BNSâs Failure to Preserve and Produce Audio Recordings and False
or Misleading Statements Concerning Audio Preservation

In August 2018, Division staff issued BNS a document preservation request calling for it
to preserve, among other things, audio recordings for a base metals supervisor with recorded
lines in Houston, Texas and New York, New York (âSupervisor 1â). In October 2018, Division
staff issued BNS a request under Section 4s of the Act (the âOctober 2018 4s Requestâ) calling
for the production of certain communications for Supervisor 1 from November and December
2017. Thereafter BNS proposed to Division staff that it would begin responding by producing
written communications. Division staff then asked BNS to confirm that audio recordings had
been preserved for certain BNS personnel, including Supervisor 1. BNS representatives initially
informed Division staff on a December 7, 2018 telephone call that BNS only had one yearâs
worth of audio recordings for the personnel, dating back to early December 2017. On December
13, 2018, however, BNS representatives spoke with Division staff to âcorrect the recordâ and
conveyed that BNS did, in fact, have all of the audio recordings, including for Supervisor 1,
dating back to at least August 2017. BNS confirmed this again orally on December 14, 2018, in
writing on January 29, 2019, and orally on January 31, 2019. In March 2019, Division staff
issued a 4s request for additional Supervisor | audio recordings from November 2017. In May
2019, BNS informed Division staff that some recordings from Supervisor |âs Houston line had
been deleted through routine processes notwithstanding the Divisionâs August 2018 preservation
request, which should have halted those processes given BNSâs assurances that the audio was
being preserved.

At the time BNSâs representatives made statements to Division staff about its
preservation of audio recordings, its supervision of its legal hold process for audio was
inadequate. BNS has represented the following. Prior to January 31, 2019, BNS did not have a
written policy or procedure for how to initiate or implement the preservation of audio recordings,
nor had it provided any formal training to its personnel on those topics. Some BNS staff
responsible for matters requiring audio preservation had the erroneous belief that sending a
notice calling for audio to be preserved to an internal group involved in preservation would be
sufficient to accomplish the necessary preservation of audio. In reality, additional steps needed
to be taken, including further communication specifying the need for audio to be preserved. The
recordings also had to be âlocked downâ to ensure their preservation through a complex process
that required different steps to be taken depending on the office location of the BNS personnel
for whom audio recordings were to be preserved.

After BNS received the Divisionâs August 2018 preservation request, BNS continued to
delete Supervisor 1âs Houston audio recordings pursuant to BNSâs one-year audio retention
policy until December 11, 2018. This was due in part to the erroneous belief that several legal
hold notices that had been issued had ensured the requested preservation, and also in part to
BNSâs lack of expertise and understanding of its own complex process to âlock downâ audio

9
recordings in different locations. As a result, BNS falsely represented to Division staff, multiple
times, that Supervisor 1âs audio recordings had been preserved dating back to at least August
2017, when in fact Supervisor 1âs Houston recordings prior to December 11, 2017, had been
deleted. BNS knew or reasonably should have known that those statements were false or
misleading.

b. BNSâs Additional Failure to Produce Audio Recordings Promptly

BNSâs inadequate supervision of its audio recording operations extended beyond its
failure to train personnel on audio preservation procedures. The Divisionâs October 2018 4s
Request also called for the production of certain audio recordings from November and December
2017 on the New York recorded lines of two base metals supervisors. In March and June 2019,
Division staff issued additional 4s requests for audio recordings for various base metals
personnel in New York and London from November and December 2017.

In or around September 2019, while responding to the Divisionâs requests, BNS
discovered gaps in its audio collection for its base metals personnelâs New York and London
recorded lines during the requested time period. BNS was previously unaware of the gaps, was
unable to provide any explanation for them, could not identify their cause, and could not scope
the full extent of the problem at that time. It was not until over eight months later that BNS
represented to Division staff that it did in fact have a full set of the New York and London
recordings, and BNS took several more weeks to complete its production. Thus, BNS failed to
meet its obligation to respond promptly to the Divisionâs 4s requests.

3. BNSâs False or Misleading Statements Regarding Supervision of the Base
Metals Desk

BNS initially represented to Division staff, in various ways, that both Supervisor | and a
second supervisor located in New York (âSupervisor 2ââ) were the relevant supervisors for BNSâs
New York base metals desk during the fall of 2017.'* Division staff took the sworn testimony of
Supervisor | on June 28, 2019, and Supervisor 2 on June 7, 2019, and inquired as to their
supervision of the New York base metals desk during the fall of 2017. Later, BNS changed its
position to support Supervisor | and Supervisor 2âs disavowals of supervisory authority for the
desk in testimony. BNS then made misleading statements to Division staff, such as affirming in
an August 23, 2019 letter that Supervisor | and Supervisor 2 âwere not the deskâs designated
supervisorsâ during the October through December 2017 time period and that they âdid not
assume full supervisory responsibility for the base metals businessâ until May 1, 2018.'Â°
Contemporaneous documentary evidence, including organization charts, human resources files,

 

'* On March 18, 2019, in response to a 4s request for organizational charts for its base metals desk including
traders, sales persons, and supervisors, BNS produced several organizational charts under cover of a letter that stated
they had been prepared âfor purposes of responding to the [4s request], based on the Bankâs personnel records.â
Three separate organizational charts produced, for March through July 2017, August 2017, and September 2017
through April 2018, showed Supervisor 1 and Supervisor 2 as supervisors for BNSâs base metals salespersons and
traders in New York.

' May 1, 2018 was the date on which an email was sent announcing a formal reorganization of the BNS metals
business globally.

10
compliance records, email communications, and audio recordings, as well as statements from
other witnesses, contradict BNSâs latter statements. BNS knew or reasonably should have
known that its statements to the Division about the supervision of its New York base metals desk
were false or misleading, and central to the staffâs investigation of the misconduct at issue.

4. Failures to Implement Policies and Procedures Reasonably Designed to
Obtain or Record Essential Facts About Counterparties

Throughout the Relevant Period, BNS also failed to implement, as required by
Regulation 23.402(b), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 23.402(b) (2019), policies and procedures reasonably
designed to obtain and record facts about whether its counterparties were U.S. persons. These
facts were needed to determine whether BNSâs transactions with those counterparties were
subject to Dodd-Frank disclosure requirements, including PTMMM disclosures.

BNSâs counterparty onboarding process has had shortcomings for years. In 2017, BNS
conducted an internal review of active counterparties that identified eight counterparties that had
been inaccurately classified as non-U.S. persons. Then again, in 2018, BNS identified an
additional fourteen counterparties that had been inaccurately classified as non-U.S. persons.
Although BNS took steps to address the errors identified, despite knowing of these repeated
errors, BNS did not conduct a full review of its onboarding policies and procedures to determine
why they were ineffective, or reviewed its counterparty data to ensure it was complete and
accurate for all of BNSâs counterparties.

In June 2019, Division staff requested that BNS produce transaction data for its base
metals transactions subject to Regulation 23.431 disclosure requirements. To respond, BNS
needed to assess the historic U.S. person status of its counterparties. However, due to BNSâs
unreliable counterparty data, it took over seven months for BNS to produce an initial list of in-
scope transactions, which it then had to correct after it found more errors in its counterparty
data.'Â® Further, BNS was unable to access counterparty data from prior to November 2014 and
was therefore unable to provide a complete response to the Divisionâs request.

5. BNSâs Failure to Comply with CCO Reporting Requirements

As a swap dealer, BNS is required to submit an annual CCO report to the Commission
discussing the state of its compliance with the Act and Regulations pursuant to Regulations
3.3(e) and (f), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 3.3(e), (f) (2019). The Commissionâs Division of Swap Dealer and
Intermediary Oversight (âDSIOâ) relies upon CCO reports when assessing a firmâs compliance
with the Act and Regulations. BNS submitted its 2017 CCO Report, for its fiscal year ended
October 31, 2017, on or around January 29, 2018.

BNS has been aware of weaknesses in its trade surveillance program since at least 2015.
By December 2017, BNS was aware, through an ongoing internal review of its trade surveillance
for OTC derivative trading activity and a review conducted by an external consultant, that its
trade surveillance program had significant weaknesses. In its 2017 CCO Report, BNS

 

'Â© As of April 24, 2020, BNS identified that six of its thirty-six in-scope base metals counterparties had been
misclassified as non-U.S. persons for various periods of time dating back to December 2014.

11
referenced its internal review of its trade surveillance program in the portion of its report
dedicated to discussing the effectiveness of its policies and procedures. It disclosed that the
review had identified two âmoderateâ risk issues and eight âlowâ risk issues, but it did not
provide information sufficient to understand and evaluate the known issues with BNSâs program.
Nor did it identify BNSâs trade surveillance program as a material noncompliance item, or even
an area for improvement. BNSâs disclosures in the 2017 CCO Report failed to sufficiently
describe the facts and circumstances surrounding its trade surveillance program such that the
Commission could understand and evaluate the issues and BNSâs remedial efforts.

Hil. LEGAL DISCUSSION

A. Section 4s(h)(1)(B) and Regulations 23.602(a)âBNSâs Failure to Supervise
Diligently

Section 4s(h)(1)(B) of the Act, requires âdiligent supervision of the business of the
registered swap dealer.â 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6s(h)(1)(B) (2018). Regulation 23.602 requires that each
swap dealer âshall establish and maintain a system to supervise, and shall diligently supervise, all
activities relating to its business performed by its partners, members, officers, employees, and
agents (or persons occupying a similar status or performing a similar function).â 17 C.F.R.

Â§ 23.602 (2019).

Under Regulation 23.602, a violation is demonstrated by showing either that: (1) the
registrantâs supervisory system was generally inadequate; or (2) the registrant failed to perform
its supervisory duties diligently. See In re Commerzbank AG, CFTC No. 19-03, 2018 WL
5921385, at *10-11 (Nov. 8, 2018) (consent order) (noting textual similarities between
Regulation 23.602 and Regulation 166.3, applying case law concerning Regulation 166.3, and
citing In re Murlas Commodities, Inc., CFTC No. 85-29, 1995 WL 523563, at *9 (Sept. 1, 1995),
and In re Paragon Futures Assoc., CFTC No. 88-18, 1992 WL 74261, at *14 (Apr. 1, 1992)); In
re INTL FCStone Markets, LLC, CFTC No. 15-27, 2015 WL 4980321, at *3 (Aug. 19, 2015)
(same). Evidence of violations that â*should be detected by a diligent system of supervision,
either because of the nature of the violations or because the violations have occurred repeatedly,â
is probative of a failure to supervise.â Jn re SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale Intâ! Ltd., CFTC No. 19-38, 2009
WL 4915485, at *7 (Sept. 30, 2019) (consent order) (quoting In re INTL FCStone Markets, 2015
WL 4980321, at *3).

BNS failed to supervise its swap dealer business activities diligently during the Relevant
Period. As described above, BNS failed to maintain an adequate supervisory system and failed
to perform its supervisory obligations diligently across the swap dealer, including failing to
supervise its base metals desk, PTMMM disclosures, PTMMM recordkeeping, audio
recordkeeping, and counterparty onboarding. BNSâs failure to supervise is demonstrated by its
failure to detect, prevent, and remediate repeated compliance failures over an extended period of
time. BNS also failed to adequately supervise and train its personnel to ensure both the
preservation and production of all audio recordings to comply with its legal obligations to
produce records to the Commission. BNS therefore failed to supervise diligently its officers,
employees, and agents, in violation of Section 4s(h)(1)(B) of the Act and Regulation 23.602(a).

12
B. Section 4s(h)(1) and Regulation 23.431(a)âBNSâs Failure to Provide Accurate and
Timely Pre-Trade Mid-Market Marks, and Its Failure to Provide Pre-Trade Mid-
Market Marks

As discussed above, Section 4s(h)(1) requires swap dealers to comply with business
conduct standards prescribed by the Commission, which includes those of Regulation
23.431(a)(2), (3) requiring swap dealers to disclose to counterparties: (1) information about the
material characteristics of the swap; and (2) the swap dealerâs material incentives and conflicts of
interest related to the swap. 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6s(h)(1) (2018); 17 C.F.R. Â§ 23.431(a)(2), (3) (2019).
The Regulations require disclosure of a mid-market mark as part of the disclosure of material
incentives and conflicts of interest. Regulation 23.431(a)(3)G). The mid-market mark âshall not
include amounts for profit, credit reserve, hedging, funding, liquidity, or any other costs or
adjustments.â Regulation 23.431(d)(2), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 23.431(d)(2) (2019). These disclosures
must be made âat a reasonably sufficient time prior to entering into a swap.ââ Regulation
23.43 1(a).

As part of the comprehensive regulatory regime for swaps, Regulation 23.402(a)(1),
17 C.F.R. Â§ 23.402(a)(1) (2019), requires that swap dealers maintain written policies and
procedures reasonably designed to ensure compliance with swap dealer business conduct
standards, including Regulation 23.431, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 23.431 (2019). In adopting Regulation
23.431, the Commission noted that âthe Commission will consider good faith complianceâ with
those policies and procedures as âa mitigating factor when exercising its prosecutorial discretion
for violation of the rules.ââ"â

During the Relevant Period, desks across BNSâs swap dealer provided PTMMMss to
counterparties that were inaccurate, untimely, or both, or failed to provide a PTMMM entirely.
These failures occurred for at least tens of thousands of swaps. BNS provided counterparties
with inaccurate PTMMMs, including instances where it adjusted the PTMMM in whole or in
part for BNSâs trading and sales markups, and therefore did not exclude amounts attributable to
âprofit, credit reserve, hedging, funding, liquidity, or any other costs or adjustments.â BNS also
failed to provide PTMMMs to counterparties prior to entering into a swap; its personnel instead
did not provide PTMMMs until after a transaction was consummated. In other instances, BNS
failed to provide a PTMMM at all. Each of these failures had the effect of concealing BNSâs full
markup from counterparties. BNS therefore violated Section 4s(h)(1) and Regulation 23.43 1(a).

Moreover, in engaging in these violations, BNS did not act in good faith compliance with
policies and procedures reasonably designed to comply with the business conduct standards
rules. BNSâs widespread PTMMM compliance failures persisted for years. BNS knew in May

 

'â Final Rule Release, 77 Fed. Reg. at 9,744; see also id. at 9,766, 9,768 (noting specifically that good faith
compliance would be relevant to violations of the mid-market mark requirements). The Commission further stated:

To be considered good faith compliance, the Commission will consider, among other things,
whether the swap dealer . . . made reasonable inquiry and took appropriate action where the swap
dealer . . . had information that would cause a reasonable person to believe that any person acting
for or on behalf of the swap dealer . . . was violating the CEA or the Commissionâs Regulations in
connection with the swaps related business of the swap dealer ....

Id. at 9,746.

13
2018 of concerns about PTMMMs from a former supervisor. Despite such knowledge, and
despite knowledge of the Divisionâs investigation, as of May 2020 BNS still had no procedures
in place to check the accuracy of PTMMMs, provided untimely PTMMMs through at least late
2018, and occasionally failed to provide PTMMMs through the end of 2019. In light of these
facts, BNS does not meet the requirements of the Commissionâs policy statement regarding
mitigation.

C. Section 4s(g) and Regulations 23.201(a)(1), 23.202(a)(1), and 1.31(d)(3)(iij)âBNSâs
Failure to Maintain Proper Records of Its Pre-Trade Mid-Market Marks

Swap dealers are required by statute to maintain records of their daily swaps trading, and
must maintain those records for each counterparty in a form that is identifiable with each swap
transaction. Section 4s(g)(1), (3), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6s(g)(1), (3) (2018). Commission Regulations
specify that a swap dealer must âkeep full, complete, and systematic records . . . of all its swaps
activities,â Regulation 23.201(a), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 23.201(a) (2019), which includes keeping daily
trading records, such as PTMMM<s, in a form and manner identifiable and searchable by
transaction and counterparty. Regulation 23.201(a)(1); Regulation 23.202(a)(1), 17 C.F.R.

Â§ 23.202(a)(1) (2019) (requiring swap dealers to keep daily trading records, including
PTMMMs, of all swaps transactions they execute). Swap dealers must ensure that their records
âinclude all information necessary to conduct a comprehensive and accurate trade reconstruction
for each swap.â Regulation 23.202(a). Pre-execution trade information must be Kept, including,
âat a minimum, records of all oral and written communications provided or received concerning
quotes, solicitations, bids, offers, instructions, trading, and prices, that lead to the execution of a
swap.â Regulation 23.202(a)(1). Regulation 23.203(b)(1), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 23.203(b)(1) (2019),
requires pre-execution trade information, like PTMMMs, to be kept in accordance with
Regulation 1.31, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.31 (2019), which in turn requires regulatory records to be
produced âin the form and medium requested [by the Commission] promptly, upon request.â
Regulation 1.31(d)(3)(ii).

During the Relevant Period, BNS failed to keep records of the PTMMMs it disclosed to
counterparties as required. BNS had some records of PTMMMs in emails, chat messages, and
audio recordings, but it did not maintain the records in a form or manner identifiable and
searchable by transaction and counterparty. BNS also failed to keep records of some of its
PTMMM disclosures entirely. BNS was therefore unable to produce PTMMM records to the
Commission promptly upon request and could not âconclusively tieâ all of the PTMMMs it did
produce to the specific transactions to which the marks pertained. BNS thus violated Section
4s(g) of the Act and Regulations 23.201(a)(1), 23.202(a)(1), and 1.31(d)(3)(i1).

D. Regulation 23.402(b)âBNSâs Failure to Obtain and Record Essential Facts About
Counterparties During the Onboarding Process

Under Regulation 23.402(b), each swap dealer must implement policies and procedures
reasonably designed to obtain and retain a record of the essential facts concerning each
counterparty, including facts required to comply with applicable laws, regulations, and rules.
17 C.F.R. Â§ 23.402(b) (2019).

14
As described above, BNS failed, for years, to implement policies and procedures
reasonably designed to obtain and record facts concerning whether its counterparties were U.S.
persons. These facts were essential to determining whether its transactions were subject to
Regulation 23.431 disclosure requirements. BNS had repeated instances of finding errors in its
counterparty data, but did not conduct a full review of its onboarding process or its counterparty
data. BNS thereby violated Regulation 23.402(b).

E. Section 4s(f) and (g) of the Act and Regulations 23.201(a)(1), 23.202(a)(1), and
1.31(d)(3)Gi)âBNSâs Failure to Retain and Produce Promptly Required Audio
Records

Section 4s(f)(1)(C) of the Act obligates swap dealers to keep books and records of all
activities related to its business as a swap dealer âopen to inspection and examination by any
representative of the Commission.â 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6s(f)(1)(C) (2018); see also Section 4s(g)(1) and
(3) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6s(g)(1), (3) (2018) (requiring swap dealers to keep daily trading and
counterparty records). These statutes are implemented, among other places, at Regulations
23.201(a)(1) and 23.202(a)(1), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 23.201(a)(1), 23.202(a)(1) (2019), which obligate a
swap dealer to âkeep full, complete, and systematic records . . . of all its swaps activities,â
Regulation 23.201(a), which includes âdaily trading records,â Regulation 23.201(a)(1);
23.202(a)(1). Regulation 23.203(b)(1), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 23.203(b)(1) (2019), requires audio
recordings of pre-execution trade information to be kept in accordance with Regulation 1.31,

17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.31 (2019), which in turn prescribes a one-year retention period, Regulation
1.31(b)(2) (âA records entity that is required to retain oral communications, shall keep regulatory
records of oral communications for a period of not less than one year from the date of such
communication.â). A swap dealer must be able to produce such records to the Commission
âpromptly, upon request.â Regulation 1.31(d)(3)(i1).

BNS deleted required audio records after Division staff issued a document preservation
notice and the October 2018 4s Request calling for the recordings to be produced. BNS also
failed to complete its production of other audio recordings subject to a Division 4s request in a
timely manner. BNS therefore violated Sections 4s(f)(1)(C) and 4s(g) of the Act and
Regulations 23.201(a)(1), 23.202(a)(1), and 1.31(d)(3)(ii).

F. Section 6(c)(2)âBNSâs False or Misleading Statements to the Commission
Section 6(c)(2) of the Act makes it unlawful for any person:

[T]o make any false or misleading statement of a material fact to the
Commission ... or to omit to state in any such statement any material fact
that is necessary to make any statement of a material fact made not
misleading in any material respect, if the person knew, or reasonably
should have known, the statement to be false or misleading.

7 U.S.C. Â§ 9(2) (2018).

As described above, BNS made statements to Division staff that it knew or reasonably
should have known were false or misleading regarding: (1) whether it had preserved all
requested audio recordings; and (11) who supervised its New York base metals desk in late 2017.

15
These statements were central to the staffâs investigation of the conduct at issue. By engaging in
this conduct, BNS violated Section 6(c)(2) of the Act.

G. Regulation 3.3(e)âBNSâs Failure to Comply with CCO Reporting Requirements

Regulation 3.3(e), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 3.3(e) (2019), requires a swap dealerâs chief compliance
officer to annually prepare a written report covering the most recently completed fiscal year.
Regulation 3.3(e)(2), (3), and (5) provides in part that the report must include: (1) a review of
each applicable requirement under the Act and Regulations, including identification of the
policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure compliance and an assessment of the
effectiveness of those procedures; (11) describe areas for improvement; and (111) describe any
material noncompliance issues identified, and the corresponding action taken.

BNSâs 2017 CCO Report did not meet these reporting requirements. By December 2017,
BNS was aware of significant weaknesses in its trade surveillance system but its 2017 CCO
Report did not describe BNSâs trade surveillance program as a material noncompliance item, or
even an area for improvement. Therefore, BNS violated Regulation 3.3(e).

IV. FINDINGS OF VIOLATIONS

Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that at various times during the Relevant
Period Respondent violated Sections 4s(f)(1)(C), 4s(g)(1) and (3), 4s(h)(1), and 6(c)(2) of the

Within 180 days of retention, and every six months thereafter, the Monitor

Such report shall include a description of the status of Respondentâs
implementation of the Remediation Plan and the Monitorâs ongoing
assessment of Respondentâs swap dealerâs compliance program.

The Monitorâs report shall also include: (1) an analysis of Respondentâs
ability to comply with the Act and Regulations, (11) a description of any
areas of non-compliance with the Act or Regulations identified by the
Monitor and not covered in the Remediation Plan, (111) any
recommendations made by the Monitor for bringing Respondent into
compliance with the areas of non-compliance identified by the Monitor;
and (iv) a description of Respondentâs implementation of any such
recommendations. If Respondent chooses not to adopt the Monitorâs
recommendations within a reasonable period of time, the Monitor shall
report that fact to DOE and DSIO, along with Respondentâs stated reason
for not adopting the same.

The Monitorâs report shall also include a description of the Monitorâs
methodology, information relied upon, and bases for the Monitorâs
findings.

The Monitor shall have the right to discuss the facts and circumstances of
DOEâs findings with DOE, and DOE may disclose to the Monitor those
portions of its investigation that may assist the Monitor in reviewing and
monitoring Respondentâs policies and procedures in accordance with
Paragraph 2(c) of these undertakings. The Monitor is also permitted to
communicate at any time with DOE and DSIO concerning its monitorship,
review, findings, assessments, and reports.

The Monitor shall immediately inform DOE and DSIO in writing if the
Monitor determines that, during the course of its monitorship, Respondent
has used or employed any fraud, manipulation, deception, concealment,

21
suppression, false pretense, or fictitious or pretended purchase or sale in
connection with any bid, offer, or trade conducted by Respondentâs swap
dealer, and may also advise DOE and DSIO in writing, in advance of a
scheduled report, if it believes Respondent is otherwise not complying
with the provisions of this Order.

g. Subject to the express limitations set forth below, the Monitorâs authority
and duties are to be broadly construed. Respondent shall cooperate fully
with the Monitor, including, but not limited to, providing the Monitor:

1. access to all files, documents, books, records, computer systems,
personnel, and facilities that fall within the scope of the
responsibilities of the Monitor, subject to a legitimate claim of any
legally recognized privilege;

ll. the right to meet with and interview any director, officer,
employee, agent, or consultant of Respondent and to participate in
any meeting concerning any matter within or relating to the
Monitorâs duties, subject to a legitimate claim of any legally
recognized privilege; and

lil. the right to observe Respondentâs business operations that fall
within the scope of the Monitorâs responsibilities, subject to a
legitimate claim of any legally recognized privilege.

If Respondent agrees, in its sole discretion, to provide the Monitor with
access to privileged materials, the Monitor shall agree not to assert that
this constitutes a waiver of any legally recognized privilege and shall
further agree to maintain the confidentiality of the privileged materials
(except to the extent that disclosure is required by law or may be
necessary in furtherance of the Monitorâs discharge of its official duties
and responsibilities).'â In the event Respondent seeks to withhold access
to privileged materials from the Monitor, or where the Respondent
reasonably believes production would otherwise be inconsistent with
applicable law, Respondent shall work cooperatively with the Monitor to
resolve the matter to the satisfaction of the Monitor. If the matter cannot
be resolved, then, at the request of the Monitor, Respondent shall provide
written notice to the Monitor, DSIO, and DOE, including a general
description of the nature of the information, documents, records, facilities,
and/or employees that are being withheld, as well as the bases of the
claim(s).

 

'Â° If the Monitor believes that disclosure is necessary in furtherance of the Monitorâs discharge of its official duties
and responsibilities, the Monitor shall provide Respondent reasonable notice in advance of such disclosure,
including the basis for such disclosure.

22
At any time during the Monitorâs term, DSIO and DOE may recommend
to the Commission that it terminate the term of the Monitor prior to three
years elapsing. After two years of the Monitorâs term, Respondent may
also petition DSIO and DOE to make such a recommendation.

Swap Dealer Registration: Respondent acknowledges and accepts that sufficient

 

grounds exist to commence proceedings to suspend or revoke Respondentâs
provisionally registered swap dealer registration status based on the findings set
forth in this Order, pursuant to Section 8a(4), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 12a(4) (2018). The
Commission will defer commencing proceedings to suspend or revoke
Respondentâs registration status in accordance with the following conditions:

a.

Upon each periodic report given by the Monitor to DOE and DSIO, and
upon completion of the Monitorâs term, DSIO will determine, in
consultation with DOE, whether Respondent is likely to implement fully
by the end of the Monitorâs term the Remediation Plan and any
recommendations of the Monitor relating to areas of non-compliance not
covered by the Remediation Plan. Based on this determination, DOE,
after consultation with DSIO, will decide whether to recommend to the
Commission that it commence proceedings to suspend, revoke in full,
condition, or restrict Respondentâs provisional registration as a swap
dealer, pursuant to Section 8a of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 12a (2018), and
Regulations 3.55 through 3.64, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 3.55-3.64 (2019). DOE,
after consultation with DSIO, may also decide to make such a
recommendation to the Commission based upon the Monitor providing
notice of misconduct to DSIO and DOE pursuant to Paragraphs 2(e) or
2(f) of these undertakings.

In the event that DSIO and DOE intend to recommend to the Commission
that it commence proceedings to suspend, revoke in full, condition, or
restrict Respondentâs registration pursuant to Paragraph 3(a) of this
undertaking, DOE will provide Respondent with written notice of the
nature of the allegations against Respondent prior to making such a
recommendation. Respondent shall have the opportunity to respond to the
allegations within forty-five (45) days of receipt of such notice. In the
event DSIO and DOE recommend the commencement of proceedings, any
written statement by Respondent will be forwarded to the Commission if
so requested. The Commission may in its discretion consider
Respondentâs statement when it determines whether to commence
proceedings to suspend, revoke in full, condition or restrict Respondentâs
registration.

If pursuant to the procedures set forth in Paragraphs 3(a) and (b) of this
undertaking the Commission determines to commence proceedings to
suspend, revoke in full, condition, or restrict Respondentâs provisionally
registered swap dealer registration status, pursuant to Section 8a of the Act
and Regulations 3.55 through 3.64, Respondent agrees that the factual

23
findings set forth in Section II.C. of this Order will be deemed admitted by
Respondent in any such proceedings.

d. At any time during or after the Monitorâs term, the Commission may
choose to take any additional enforcement action and DOE may choose to
commence any further investigation or action either in response to any
findings made by the Monitor or for any other reason.

e. Respondent understands and agrees that the running of any statute of
limitations applicable to any proceeding against Respondent arising out of
findings made by the Monitor that is authorized, instituted, or brought by
or on behalf of the Commission is tolled as of the date of this Order
through the end of the term of the Monitor.

4. Public Statements: Respondent agrees that neither it nor any of its successors and
assigns, agents, or employees under its authority or control shall take any action
or make any public statement denying, directly or indirectly, any findings or
conclusions in this Order or creating, or tending to create, the impression that this
Order is without a factual basis; provided, however, that nothing in this provision
shall affect Respondentâs and/or its agentsâ and/or employeesâ: (1) testimonial
obligations; or (11) right to take positions in other proceedings to which the
Commission is not a party. Respondent and its successors and assigns shall
undertake all steps necessary to ensure that all of its agents and/or employees
under its authority or control understand and comply with this agreementâ.

5. Cooperation, in General: Respondent shall cooperate fully and expeditiously with
the Commission, including with DOE, in this action, and in any current or future
Commission investigation or action related thereto (âCommission Related
Mattersâ). Respondent shall also cooperate in any investigation, civil litigation,
or administrative matter related to, or arising from, the subject matter of this
action (âSubject Related Mattersâ). Respondentâs cooperation shall continue for a
period of five years from the date of entry of this Order, or until any Commission
Related Matters or Subject Related Matters are concluded, whichever is longest.
As part of such cooperation, Respondent agrees to:

 

a. preserve and produce to the Commission in a responsive and prompt
manner, as requested by the Divisionâs staff, all non-privileged
documents, information, and other materials wherever located, in the
possession, custody, or control of Respondent;

b. utilize their knowledge and skill to explain transactions, interpret
information and terminology, or identify new and productive lines of
inquiry;

 

Â°Â° To the extent that the Commission brings an enforcement action against any employee or agent of Respondent
arising from the same nexus of facts as this Order, this provision shall not apply to actions or public statements by
such employee made in connection with that enforcement action.

24
C. prepare and appear for interviews and testimony at such times and places
as requested by the Divisionâs staff;

d. respond completely and truthfully to all inquiries and interviews, when
requested to do so by the Divisionâs staff;

e. identify and authenticate relevant documents, execute affidavits or
declarations, and testify completely and truthfully at depositions, trial, and
other judicial proceedings, when requested to do so by the Divisionâs staff;

f. accept service by mail, electronic mail, or facsimile transmission of
notices or subpoenas for documents and/or testimony at depositions,
hearings, or trials;

g. appoint Respondentâs attorney as agent to receive service of such notices
and subpoenas; and

h. waive the territorial limits on service contained in Rule 45 of the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure and any applicable local rules.

6. Partial Satisfaction: Respondent understands and agrees that any acceptance by
the Commission of any partial payment of Respondentâs CMP Obligation shall
not be deemed a waiver of its obligation to make further payments pursuant to this
Order, or a waiver of the Commissionâs right to seek to compel payment of any
remaining balance.

 

7. Change of Address/Phone: Until such time as Respondent satisfies in full 1ts CMP
Obligation as set forth in this Consent Order, Respondent shall provide written
notice to the Commission by certified mail of any change to its telephone number
and mailing address within ten (10) calendar days of the change.

 

The provisions of this Order shall be effective as of this date.
By the Commission.
