I. SUMMARY

L. Beginning in at least September 2016 and continuing to the present (the ârelevant
periodâ), JAFX, Ltd. aka JAFX, EOOD (âJAFXâ or âDefendantââ), an offshore company
claiming to operate from St. Vincent and the Grenadines and Bulgaria, using the website
http://www. JAFX.com (âwebsiteâ) and videos on http://www. YouTube.com (âYouTubeâ), is, or
has offered to be, the counterparty to leveraged, retail foreign currency (ââforexââ) transactions for

customers located in the United States who are not Eligible Contract Participants (âECPsââ),

without being registered with the Commission as a retail foreign exchange dealer (âRFEDâ), in
violation of Section 2(c)(2)(C)(iii)(1)(aa) of the Commodity Exchange Act (âAct or CEAâ),
7USS.C. Â§ 2(c)(2)(C)(11)(D(aa) (2012), and Commission Regulation (âRegulationâ) 5.3(a)(6)(i),
17 C.F.R. Â§ 5.3(a)(6)(@) (2017).

2. Throughout the relevant period, each time JAFX opened an account for a retail
forex customer to engage in retail forex transactions, it failed to provide each retail forex
customer with a written âRisk Disclosure Statement,â in violation of Regulation 5.5, 17 C.F.R. Â§
5.5 (2017). |

3. By virtue of this conduct and the further conduct described herein, JAFX has
engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in acts and practices in violation of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
Â§Â§ 1-26 (2012), and the Regulations, 17 C.F.R. pts. 1-190 (2017).
=======
without being registered with the Commission as a retail foreign exchange dealer (“RFED”), in
violations of Section 2(c)(2)(C)(iii)(1)(aa) of the Commodity Exchange Act (“Act or CEA”),
7USS.C. § 2(c)(2)(C)(11)(D(aa) (2012), and Commission Regulation (“Regulation”) 5.3(a)(6)(i),
17 C.F.R. § 5.3(a)(6)(@) (2017).

2. Throughout the relevant period, each time JAFX opened an account for a retail
forex customer to engage in retail forex transactions, it failed to provide each retail forex
customer with a written “Risk Disclosure Statement,” in violations of Regulation 5.5, 17 C.F.R. §
5.5 (2017). |

3. By virtue of this conduct and the further conduct described herein, JAFX has
engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in acts and practices in violations of the Act, 7 U.S.C.

4. Accordingly, pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2012), and
7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(c)(2)(C), the Commission brings this action to enjoin JAFXâs unlawful acts and
practices and to compel its compliance with the Act and the Regulations and to further enjoin
JAFX from engaging in certain commodity or forex-related activity, including soliciting or
accepting orders from U.S. customers and offering to be the counterparty to customersâ forex
transactions without appropriate registration with the Commission and opening accounts without
the required disclosure statements.

5. In addition, the Commission seeks civil monetary penalties and remedial ancillary
relief including, but not limited to, trading and registration bans, restitution, disgorgement,
rescission, pre- and post-judgment interest, and such other relief as the Court may deem

necessary and appropriate.

6. Unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, JAFX likely will continue to engage

in the acts and practices alleged in this Complaint and similar acts and practices, as more fully

described below.

I. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

7. This Court has jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1331 (2012)
(federal question jurisdiction) and 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1345 (2012) (providing that U.S. district courts
have original jurisdiction over civil actions commenced by the United States or by any agency
expressly authorized to sue by Act of Congress). In addition, Section 6c(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.

Â§ 13a-1(a) (2012), provides that the Commission may bring actions for injunctive relief or
enforce compliance with the Act in the proper district court of the United States whenever it shall
appear to the Commission that such person has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in
any act or practice constituting a violations of any provision of the Act or any rule, regulation, or
order thereunder.

8. The Commission also has jurisdiction over the conduct and transactions at issue in
this case pursuant to Sections 2(c)(2)(C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 2(c)(2)(C) (2012).

9. Venue properly lies with the Court pursuant to 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(e) because JAFX
transacts business in this District and certain transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business

alleged in this Complaint occurred, are occurring, and/or are about to occur within this District.

Ill. PARTIES

10. Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an independent federal
regulatory agency charged by Congress with the administration and enforcement of the Act and

the Regulations.
 

11. Defendant JAFX, Ltd. aka JAFX EOOD, is a Bulgarian company licensed to do
business in St. Vincent and the Grenadines. It uses as a business address The Financial Services
Centre, Stoney Ground, Kingstown, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and also purports to have a
business address in Bulgaria at Sofia 1463, Triaditsa District, Prestige Business Center, 49
Patriarch Evtimii, 4th floor, Bulgaria. JAFX has never been registered with the Commission in
any capacity.

IV. STATUTORY BACKGROUND

12. â Section 2(c)(2)(C)(iii) (D(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(c)(2)(C)Gii)(D(aa) (2012),
prohibits any person, unless registered with the Commission in such capacity as the Commission
by rule, regulation, or order shall determine, from soliciting and accepting from retail customers
orders for transactions in forex offered on a leveraged or margined basis that do not result in
actual delivery and do not create an enforceable obligation to deliver between a seller and a
buyer who have the ability to deliver and accept delivery.

13. | The Act defines an ECP, in relevant part, as an individual with total assets in
excess of: (i) $10 million, or (ii) $5 million and who enters the transaction âto manage the risk
associated with an asset owned or liability incurred, or reasonably likely to be owned or incurred,
by the individual.â CEA Â§1a(18)(xi), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1a(18)(xi). Individuals who do not meet these
criteria are non-ECPs. JAFXâs customers are typically non-ECPsâ1.e., retail customers.

14. The Regulations define an RFED, in relevant part, as any person that is, or offers
to be, the counterparty to a retail forex transaction. Regulation 5.1(h)(1), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 5.1(h)(1)

(2017).
Case 2:18-cv-00598-CW Document 2 Flecd Ov/27/18 Page 5 of LS
15. The Regulations define a retail forex transaction as any account, agreement,

contract or transaction described in 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(c)(2)(B), or Â§ 2(c)(2)(C). 17 C.F.R. Â§ 5.1(m).
A retail forex transaction does not include an account, agreement, contract or transaction in forex
that is a contract of sale of a commodity for future delivery (or an option thereon) that is

executed, traded on or otherwise subject to the rules of a contract market designated pursuant to

Section 5(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 5(a) (2012). Jd.

V. FACTS
A. JAFXâs Operations
16. | JAFX solicits orders from U.S. customers who are not ECPs to open leveraged,

retail forex trading accounts through JAFXâs website as well as videos on YouTube, where
JAFX is, or offers to be, the counterparty to each leveraged, retail forex transaction. Customers
are directed to open trading accounts by submitting an online account application through
JAFXâs website. JAFX encourages customers to access and trade their accounts via a mobile
application (âappâ), stating on the JAFX website: âClients are able to access all trading tools on
the go with our 10S/Android mobile trading app. Trade anywhere and anytime.â While the
website contains language noting that the solicitations are ânot directed at U.S. customers,â there
is nothing in the online account application stating JAFX does not accept U.S. customers, nor are
U.S. customers prevented from opening accounts. The application process contains a drop-down
menu of companies from which JAFX accepts customers; the first country listed is the âUnited
States.ââ U.S. customers may open an account with JAFX with as little as $100 USD.

17. JAFXâs online account application does not seek any information about

prospective customersâ ability to send or receive actual delivery of forex or customersâ business
 

need for forex. JAFXâs online account application does not inquire as to whether a prospective
customer is an ECP or about a prospective customerâs savings and investments. The online
account application does not inquire if a prospective customer has assets in excess of $5 million,
nor does it inquire if the prospective customer is seeking to trade forex to manage the risk of an
asset or liability already owned, or about to be owned, by the prospective customer.

18. During the relevant period, JAFX solicited and accepted funds and orders from
non-ECP, U.S. resident customers to trade leveraged forex contracts, for which JAFX acted as
the counterparty to each retail forex transaction. While JAFXâs website states, in part: âAll
information on this website is not directed towards soliciting citizens or residents of the United
States and the United Kingdom,â this is nothing more than a poor attempt to evade U.S.
regulatory requirements. That JAFX actively seeks U.S. customers is demonstrated by other
aspects of its website which provides a âU.S. toll free number,â and the fact that it has accepted
thousands of applications from U.S. customers. In addition, the âfrequently asked questionsâ or
FAQ section of the website does not list the U.S. under the section titled: âââWhat countries are
restricted from using JAFX.â

19. In addition, nowhere on JAFXâs online application does it solicit information
concerning whether prospective customers are ECPs, and it fails to inquire whether a prospective
customer has the ability or the business need to accept foreign currency into his or her bank
account. In the FAQ portion its website, JAFX advises customers:

Once your documents are fully verified it is time to fund your
landing account. A JAFX landing account is where you can store
funds before you distribute them into your trading accounts. Funds

in the landing account cannot be traded unless you move them to a
trading account.
Case 2:18-cv-00598-OQW Document2 Fed Ov/27fls Page 7 of is
20. | JAFX permits U.S. and international customers to fund forex trading accounts

using wire transfer, Skrill,' credit/debit cards, and/or Bitcoin. To create a trading account,
prospective customers are directed to âclick on the âMy Accountsâ tab in the JAFX Portal and
click on âAdd USD Accountâ.â Moreover, the default setting for JAFXâs funding trading
accounts is United States dollars (âUSDâ).

21. Once a customer has funded a trading account, JAFX allows customers to link
their trading account to as many accounts traded by third-party account managers as the
customer desires:

Once you have successfully deposited into your âLanding Accountâ
you will eligible to create as many managed accounts as you wish.
A JAFX managed account will give you the ability to follow JAFX
Third Parties. You will need to create a separate Managed
Account for each EA or third party that you wish to follow giving
you the ability to spread your funds across programs.

22. JAFXâs online account application does not require that the customer state
whether or not the customer has the ability to deliver and accept delivery in connection with the
customerâs lines of business, which is one of the prerequisites to qualify as an ECP. In fact, with
leveraged, retail forex accounts being offered for as little as $100 USD, JAFX is specifically
soliciting customers that typically could never qualify as ECPs.

23. | JAFX neither advises actual and prospective U.S. customers in its solicitations to
that JAFX is required to be registered with the Commission as an RFED, nor does JAFX advise

actual and prospective customers that it is acting unlawfully by operating as a RFED in the U.S.

without such registration. In the FAQ section of the website, JAFX appears to acknowledge its

 

' An online payment and money transfer service offering, inter alia, international money transfers. See
www.skrill.com.
unlawful conduct by stating: âJAFX is currently not regulated. Regulation takes a very long
time to setup and we are in the process of applying for regulation.â As of the date of the filing of
this Complaint, JAFX has not filed for registration with the Commission.

24. JAFX determines the maximum and minimum trade size for all trades it offers to
customers, and determines the amount of leverage it offers customers. JAFX advises its
customers in the FAQ section of its website that: âThe minimum trade size is 0.01 Lotâ and
âThe maximum trade size of (sic) 1,000 Lots.â JAFX further advises customers under the FAQ
section of its website titled, âWhat is the maximum leverage JAFX offers?,â that the maximum
leverage JAFX offers clients is 1:500. This means that a customer can increase its trading
position by buying or selling up to 500 times the amount of funds the customer invested. Thus,
for example, a JAFX customer may trade up to $500,000 notional value in foreign currencies
with a $1,000 deposit, and a customer with $10,000 invested may trade up to $5,000,000 in
foreign currencies. This high degree of leverage means that even a small price movement can
produce large losses in relation to the customerâs initial deposit and can result in customers
rapidly losing their funds and being unable to ever recover from a losing trade.

25. | JAFXâs forex contracts neither result in delivery within two days nor create an
enforceable obligation to deliver between a seller and a buyer who have the ability to deliver and
accept delivery, respectively, in connection with their lines of business. Rather, these forex
contracts are ultimately offset without anyone making or taking delivery of actual currency (or
facing an obligation to do so).

26. Each of the retail forex transactions offered by JAFX are the type of accounts,

agreements, contracts or transactions described in Section 2(c)(2)(B) or 2(c)(2)(C) of the Act,
 

7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(c)(2)(B), (C) (2012). None of the transactions in forex offered by JAFX is a
contract of sale of a commodity for future delivery (or an option thereon) that is executed, traded
on or otherwise subject to the rules of a contract market designated pursuant to Section 5(a) of
the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 5(a) (2012). Therefore, each transaction offered by JAFX is a retail forex
transaction.

27. JAFXâs ââterms and conditions,â which are set forth in its website, further
confirms that JAFX agrees to act as an RFED by agreeing to âprovide services to Customer in
connection with the purchase and sale of over-the counter margin based [forex] trading
contractsâ and by noting that âCustomer hereby acknowledges and agrees that JAFX may act as
the counterparty to Customer for any trade entered for the undersignedâs Account.â Thus, JAFX
is an RFED, and has been acting as an RFED, because it is, and has offered to be, the
counterparty to U.S. customersâ retail forex transactions.

28. JAFX is not exempt from the requirement to register with the Commission as an
RFED.

B. Mandatory Disclosure Statement to Retail Forex Customers
29. Regulation 5.5, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 5.5 (2017), prohibits RFEDs from opening a retail
forex account unless they first furnish customers with a written disclosure statement that
provides certain mandated information specified in 17 C.F.R. Â§ 5.5 concerning forex trading
and receive back from the customer a signed acknowledgment that the customer received and
understood the disclosure statement.
30. Atno time during the relevant period has JAFX provided this disclosure statement

to its U.S. retail forex customers.

U.S. customers who are non-ECPs, are required to be registered with the Commission as retail

34. | Throughout the relevant period, JAFX solicited or accepted orders from U.S.

36. The allegations set forth in the foregoing paragraphs are re-alleged and

37... Regulation 5.5, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 5.5 (2017), prohibits RFEDs from opening any forex
account for retail customer unless the RFED first provides the customer with a written disclosure
statement that includes the following information: -

(a) for each of the most recent four calendar quarters during which the
counterparty maintained retail forex acounts:

(i) the total number of non-discretionary retail forex customer
accounts maintained by the retail foreign exchange dealer;

(ii) the percentage of accounts that were profitable during the equarter;
and

(iii) the percentage of such accounts that were not profitable during the
quarter.

(b) a Risk Disclosure Statement warning of the financial losses that can inccur
using leverage, conflicts of interests and other risks. Specifically, RFEDs
must disclose in writing, in all capital letters, that:

(i) the RFEDâs trading is not on a regulated market or exchange and
customersâ funds have no regulatory protection;

(ii) because of leverage and other risks, customers can rapidly lose all
of their funds;

(ili) | the RFED, if serving as the counterparty, has a direct financial
conflict of interest with the customer because when the customer
loses money trading, the counterparty dealer is making money on
such trades;

(iv) | the RFED may commingle customersâ funds with its own
operating funds or use them for other purposes; and

-|]-
   

(v) in the event that the RFED becomes bankrupt, funds the dealer is
holding for customers, in addition to funds owed to customers
whether or not any assets are maintained in separate deposit
accounts by the dealer, may be treated as an unsecured creditorâs
claim.

38. 17 C.F.R. Â§ 5.5 also requires that the RFED receives back from the retail forex
customer a signed and dated acknowledgement that thÃ© customer received and understood the
disclosure statement.

39. JAFX did not provide its U.S. retail forex customers with a disclosure statement
that comports with these requirements. Therefore, JAFX violated, and continues to violate
17 C.F.R. Â§ 5.5, each time it accepts a U.S. customer.
