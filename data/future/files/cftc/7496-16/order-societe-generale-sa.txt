ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTIONS 6(c) AND 6(d) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, MAKING
FINDINGS AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

iF

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (ââCommissionâ or âCFTCâ ) has reason to
believe that from approximately July 2014 through April 2015 (the ârelevant periodâ), SociÃ©tÃ©
GÃ©nÃ©rale SA (âRespondentâ or âSociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©raleâ) violated Sections 2(a)(13)(F) and (G) and
4r(a)(3) of the Commodity Exchange Act (the âActâ), 7 U.S.C. 88 2(a)(13)(F), (G), 6r(a)(3)
(2012), and Commission Regulations (âRegulationsâ) 43.3(a), 43.4(a), 45.3(c) and 45.4(a), 17
C.F.R. Â§Â§ 43,3(a), 43.4(a), 45.3(c) and 45.4(a) (2016). Therefore, the Commission deems it
appropriate and in the public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are,
instituted to determine whether Respondent engaged in the violations set forth herein and to
determine whether any order should be issued imposing remedial sanctions.

I.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Respondent has
submitted an Offer of Settlement (âOfferâ), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Without admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, Respondent consents to
the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 6(c) and 6(d) of the
Commodity Exchange Act, Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions Orderâ) and
acknowledge service of this Order.'

 

Respondent consents to the entry of this Order and to the use of these findings in this proceeding and in
any other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party; provided,
however, that Respondent does not consent to the use of the Offer, or the findings or conclusions in this
Order consented to in the Offer, as the sole basis for any other proceeding brought by the Commission,
other than in a proceeding in bankruptcy or to enforce the terms of this Order. Nor does Respondent
consent to the use of the Offer or this Order, or the findings or conclusions in this Order consented to in
the Offer, by any other party in any other proceeding.
III.
The Commission finds the following:
A. SUMMARY

As a provisionally registered swap dealer, SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale is required to comply with
certain reporting requirements related to its swap transactions. Section 2(a)(13)(F) and (G) of
the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(a)(13)(F), (G) (2012), requires parties to a swap transaction to report swap
transaction information to a registered swap data repository (âSDRâ) in a timely manner, as
prescribed by the Commission. Similarly, Section 4r(a)(3) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6r(a)(3) (2012)
requires swap dealers to report swap transactions to a SDR within such time period as prescribed
by the Commission. In particular, Commission Regulations specify requirements for real-time
public reporting, public availability of swap transaction and pricing data, and reporting of
creation and continuation data toa SDR. See 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 43, 45 (2016). The reporting
requirements are designed to enhance transparency, promote standardization, and reduce
systemic risk.

During the relevant period, SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale inadvertently failed to properly report non-
deliverable forward transactions to a SDR in violation of Section 2(a)(13)(F) and (G) of the Act,
7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(a)(13)(F), (G) (2012) and Regulations 43.3(a)(3) and 43.4(a), 17 C.F.R.

Â§Â§ 43,3(a)(3), 43.4(a) (2016). Similarly, during the relevant period, SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale, as the
reporting counterparty, mistakenly failed to timely report to a SDR a large number of FX swap,
FX forward, and non-deliverable forward transactions, including the requisite continuation data
for those transactions, in violation of Section 4r(a)}(3) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6r(a)(3) (2012) and
Regulations 45.3(c)(1) and 45.4(a), 17 CFR. Â§Â§ 45.3(c)(1), 45.4(a) 2016).

Because of SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©raleâs reporting failures, data for the non-deliverable forward
trades was not disseminated to the market through the real time public tape, and data for the FX
swaps, FX forwards, and non-deliverable forwards was not reported to the Commission.
Reporting is at the heart of the Commissionâs market and financial surveillance programs, which
are critical to the Commissionâs mission to protect market participants and promote market
integrity. Accurate swap data is thus essential to effective fulfillment of the regulatory functions
of the Commission, including meaningful surveillance and enforcement programs. Moreover,
real-time public dissemination of swap transaction and pricing data supports the fairness and
efficiency of markets and increases transparency, which in turn improves price discovery.

In accepting SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©raleâs Offer, the Commission recognizes Respondentâs
significant cooperation during the investigation of this matter by the Commissionâs Division of
Enforcement (âDivisionâ), which included self-reporting, undertaking an internal investigation,
and taking remedial action to correct its reporting failures.â

determining the appropriate level of sanctions to impose or approve in enforcement actions, See CFTC

B, RESPONDENT

SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale SA is a non-United States swap dealer headquartered in Paris, France.
SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale was provisionally registered as a swap dealer with the Commission on
December 31, 2012.

Cc, FACTS

SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©raleâs failure to properly report its swap transactions had its genesis in July
2014, when it implemented a software update to its FX trading platform. That software update
led to the trading platform incorrectly coding SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©raleâs counterparty as the reporting
counterparty for certain FX swaps, FX forwards and non-deliverable forwards when the trading
platform should have coded SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale as the reporting party. This error led to neither
party to certain FX swaps, FX forwards, and non-deliverable forwards making any report
regarding the swaps to the SDR.

SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale first discovered the error in January 2015, during a routine control
check, when it determined that its computer system had inadvertently flagged the counterparty as
the reporting party for a swap transaction. Upon discovering the coding error, SociÃ©tÃ©
GÃ©nÃ©raleâs Operations Group and IT Team worked to repair the error, which was not fixed until
April 2015. On April 26, 2015, SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale began reporting daily snapshots for all new
trades as well as any open positions, using the new coding. Also in late April 2015, SociÃ©tÃ©
GÃ©nÃ©rale initiated a project to identify trades affected by the coding error. At the same time,
SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©raleâs staff began discussions with its SDR, Depository Trust and Clearing
Corporation (âDTCCâ), to determine how to back-load swap reports under Regulations 43 and
45.

On September 18, 2015, SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale notified the Commissionâs Division of Market
Oversight (âDMOâ) staff about its failure to report a large number of swaps due to the coding
error. For the FX swap, FX forward, and non-deliverable forward transactions, DMO staff
confirmed the need for SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale to submit reports required under Regulations 43 and 45,
and for DTCC to publish the Regulation 43 reports.

SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale submitted its Regulation 45 SDR data related to the FX swaps, FX
forwards and non-deliverable forward trades, by back-loading a single state data report, covering
51,821 unreported FX swap, FX forward, and non-deliverable forward transactions on October
27,2015. Between November 2015 and April 2016, SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale and DTCC discussed how
to submit its Regulation 43 real time reports, covering approximately 2,024 non-deliverable
forward transactions, in order to minimize the potential unintended consequences of publishing
old trades to the real-time public tape. After consulting with DMO staff in late April 2016 to
confirm the methodology for SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale to submit, and for DTCC to publish, the

 

available

at:http://www.cfte.gov/ucm/groups/public/@cpdisciplinaryhistory/documents/file/enfcooperation-
advisory.pdf.
Regulation 43 reports, SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale submitted small batches of real time messages and
completed their Regulation 43 submissions for the non-deliverable forward transactions on May
6, 2016.

Iv.

LEGAL DISCUSSION

To enhance transparency, promote standardization, and reduce systemic risk, Section 727
of the Dodd-Frank Act added to the Commodity Exchange Act a provision that requires all
swaps, both cleared and uncleared, be reported to a registered SDR and establishes
requirements for real-time reporting and public availability of swap transaction data. See
7 U.S.C, Â§2(a)(13)(G)(2012). Pursuant to these requirements, the Commission adopted
implementing regulations, including under Parts 43 and 45; the requirements under these
regulations were phased-in based upon asset classes. See Real-Time Public Reporting of Swap
Transaction Data, 77 Fed.Reg. 1182 (Jan. 9, 2012); Swap Data Recordkeeping and Reporting
Requirements, 77 Fed.Reg. 2136 (Jan. 13, 2012).

Part 43 establishes requirements for the real-time public reporting and public
availability of swap transaction data. See 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 43.2, 43.3 (2016). Under Part 43,
reporting parties must report a publicly reportable swap transaction to an SDR as soon as
technologically practicable after the swap transaction is executed. See 17 C.F.R. Â§ 43.3(a)(1)
(2016). A publicly reportable swap transaction is defined in Regulation 43.2 and includes,
among other things, â[a]ny termination, assignment, novation, exchange, transfer, amendment,
conveyance, or extinguishing of rights or obligations of a swap that changes the pricing of a
swap.â 17 C.F.R Â§ 43.2 (2016).

Part 45 requires reporting parties to, among other things, report swap creation and
continuation data to ensure that all data concerning a swap remains current and accurate.
17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 45.3, 45.4 (2016). Reporting parties can comply with the continuation data
requirement by âreporting life cycle event data or state data for the swap ...â 17 C.F.R.
Â§ 45.4(a) (2016). The Regulations define a life cycle event to include âany event that would
result in either a change to a primary economic term of a swap or to any primary economic terms
data previously reported to a swap data repository in connection with a swap[,]â including
among other things, a âpartial or full termination of the swap,â a âchange to the end date for the
swap,â and âa change in the cash flows or rates originally reported.â 17 C.F.R. Â§ 45.1 (2016).

The accuracy and completeness of swap reporting are critical to the Commissionâs
mission to protect market participants and to ensure market integrity. See, e.g., In re Deutsche
Bank AG, CFTC No. 15-40, 2015 WL 5783049 (CFTC Sept. 30, 2015) (consent order); Jn re
ICE Futures U.S., Inc., CFTC No. 15-17, 2015 WL 1276463 (CFTC Mar. 16, 2015) (consent
order). Market participants rely upon the public availability of swaps data for price discovery
purposes. The Commission, in turn, requires complete and accurate reporting data to engage in
meaningful oversight of the swaps market.

During the relevant period, SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale failed to properly report non-deliverable
forward transactions to a SDR in violation of Section 2(a)(13)(F) and (G) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§
2(a)(13){F), (G) (2012), and Regulations 43.3(a)(3) and 43.4(a), 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 43.3(a)(3), 43.4(a)

4
(2016). Similarly, during the relevant period, SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale, as the reporting counterparty,
failed to timely report to a SDR a large number of FX swap, FX forward, and non-deliverable
forward transactions, including the requisite continuation data for those transactions, in violation
of Section 4r(a)(3) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6r(a)(3) (2012), and Regulations 45.3(c)(1) and 45.4(a),
17 C.E.R. Â§Â§ 45.3(c)(1), 45.4(a) (2016). The foregoing acts, omissions, and failures of SociÃ©tÃ©
GÃ©nÃ©raleâs employees occurred within the scope of their employment, office, or agency with
SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale; therefore, pursuant to Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.D. Â§2(a)(1)(B)
(2012), and Regulation 1.2, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.2 (2016), SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale is liable for those acts,
omissions, and failures in violation of Sections 2(a)(13)(F) and (G) and 4r(a)(3) of the Act,
TUS.C. Â§Â§ 2(a)(13)(F), (G), 6r(a)(3) (2012), and Regulations 43.3(a), 43.4(a), 45.3(c) and
45.4(a), 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 43.3(a), 43.4(a), 45.3(c) and 45.4(a) (2016).

FINDINGS OF VIOLATION
Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that during the relevant period, SociÃ©tÃ©
GÃ©nÃ©rale violated Sections 2(a)(13)(F) and (G) and 4r(a)(3) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 2(a)(13(F),
(G), 6r(a)(3) (2012), and Regulations 43.3(a)(3), 43.4(a), 45.3(c)(1) and 45.4(a), 17 C.F.R.
Â§Â§ 43.3(a)(3), 43.4(a), 45.3(c)(1) and 45.4(a) (2016).
