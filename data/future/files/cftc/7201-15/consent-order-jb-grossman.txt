I. SUMMARY
A. Parties
14. _â~ Plaintiff U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an independent

federal regulatory agency charged by Congress with the responsibility for administering and
enforcing the provisions of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1 et seg. (2012), and the Regulations promulgated
thereunder, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1.1 et seg. (2013).

15. Defendant Jay Bruce Grossman is licensed to practice law in Florida, New York,
and the District of Columbia. He maintains a law practice in Fort Lauderdale, Florida under the
law firm name J.B. Grossman, P.A. (âJBGPAâ), and he previously practiced law at
GrossmanGreenberg, LLC (âGrossmanGreenbergâ). Grossman was registered with the CFTC as
an associated person of various firms in the 1980s. He has not been registered with the CFTC in

any capacity since then.

B. Factual Allegations in the Complaint

16. | The Commissionâs Complaint alleges that Grossman, in his capacity as an attorney,
willfully aided and abetted multiple clients in their operation of unlawful precious metals schemes
by crafting the illusion that their schemes were legitimate and complied with the law, when in fact
none of his clients actually sold physical metals or disbursed loans to customers, as they claimed.

These schemes were explicitly made subject to the Commissionâs prosecutorial authority on July

4
Case 0:14-cv-62061-BB Document 32 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2015 Page 5 of 13

16, 2011, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010
(âDodd-Frankâ), Public Law 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376 (2010), which granted the CFTC new
authority to regulate retail commodity transactions âas ifâ they were futures contracts.

17. Specifically, the Complaint alleges that Grossman willfully aided and abetted his
clients Hunter Wise Commodities, LLC (âHW Commoditiesâ), Hunter Wise Credit, LLC (âHW
Creditâ), and Hunter Wise Trading, LLC (âHW Tradingâ) (collectively, âHunter Wiseâ) and
AmeriFirst Management LLC (âAmeriFirstâ), which held themselves out as metals âclearing
firmsâ for their respective networks of metals âdealersâ that solicited the retail public, in engaging
in unlawful off-exchange retail commodity transactions and committing fraud in connection with
those transactions on and after July 16, 2011, and that he is therefore liable for Hunter Wiseâs and
AmeriFirstâs violations of Sections 4(a), 4b, and 6(c)(1) of the Commodity Exchange Act (âActâ),
7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6(a), 6b, and 9(1) (2012), and Regulation 180.1, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 180.1 (2013), pursuant to
Section 13(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13c(a) (2012).

18. The Complaint further alleges that Grossman willfully aided and abetted Lloyds
Commodities, LLC (âLloyds Commoditiesâ), Lloyds Commodities Credit Company, LLC
(âLloyds Creditâ), and Lloyds Services, LLC (âLloyds Servicesâ) (collectively, âLloydsââ), which
acted as an intermediary between Hunter Wise and certain of its metals dealers, in confirming the
execution of and conducting business in the United States for the purpose of accepting orders for,
or otherwise dealing in, unlawful off-exchange retail commodity transactions on and after July 16,
2011, and that he is therefore liable for Lloydsâ violation of Section 4(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
Â§ 6(a), pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13c(a).

19. Finally, the Complaint alleges that Grossman willfully aided and abetted several
Hunter Wise metals dealers that fraudulently solicited the retail public in engaging in unlawful
off-exchange retail commodity transactions on and after July 16, 2011, including Secured Precious

5
Case 0:14-cv-62061-BB Document 32 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2015 Page 6 of 13

Metals International, Inc. (âSPMIââ) and Secured Precious Metals Management, Inc. (ââSPMMâ)
(collectively, âSecured Precious Metalsâ) and Joseph Glenn Commodities LLC (âJGCâ) and
JGCF LLC (âJGCFââ) (collectively, âJoseph Glennâ), and that he is therefore liable for their
violations of Section 4(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6(a), pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Act,
7 U.S.C. Â§ 13c(a).

OF Jurisdiction and Venue

20. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 6c(a) of the Act,
7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(a) (2012), which provides that whenever it shall appear to the Commission that
any person has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a
violation of any provision of the Act or any rule, regulation, or order promulgated thereunder, the
Commission may bring an action in the proper district of the United States against such person to
enjoin such act or practice, or to enforce compliance with the Act, or any rule, regulation or order
thereunder.

21. | Venue properly lies with this Court pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
Â§ 13a-1(e), because Grossman transacted business in this District and certain of the acts and
practices alleged to be in violation of the Act occurred within this District.
THE PARTIES AGREE AND IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT:

IV. PERMANENT INJUNCTION

22. Pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1, Defendant Grossman its
permanently restrained, enjoined, and prohibited from directly or indirectly engaging in any
conduct in violation of Sections 4(a), 4b, and 6(c)(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6(a), 6b, and 9(1)

(2012), and Regulation 180.1, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 180.1 (2014).
Case 0:14-cv-62061-BB Document 32 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2015 Page 7 of 13

V. UNDERTAKING

23. Defendant Grossman agrees that he will not appear or practice before the
Commission as an attorney until such time as he has been reinstated by order of the Commission

Order are not a suspension or disbarment from the practice of law by this Court. Grossman does
not consent to the use of this Consent Order as the sole basis for any other proceeding brought by
the Commission.

VI. RESTITUTION AND CIVIL MONETARY PENALTY

A. Restitution

24. | Defendant Grossman shall pay restitution in the amount of SEVEN HUNDRED
AND THIRTY-THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS ($733,000) (âRestitution Obligationâ), plus

and shall have the discretion to determine and recommend to the Court the amount payable to each

HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ($150,000) (âCMP Obligationâ), plus post-
