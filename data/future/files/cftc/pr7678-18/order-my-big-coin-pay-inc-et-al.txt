Filed Under Seal

(J2â
[PROPOSED] ORDER
GRANTING PLAINTIFFâS MOTION
FOR AN EX PARTE TEMPORARY
RESTRAINING ORDER

Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ) has filed a Complaint

For Injunctive and Other Equitable Relief and For Civil Monetary Penalties Under the

Commodity Exchange Act and Commission Regulations (âComplaintâ), and moved, pursuant to

Section 6c(a) of the Commodity Exchange Act (âActâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(a) (2012), and in

accordance with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (âFed. R. Civ. P.â) 65, for an ex parte

temporary restraining order (1) freezing Defendantsâ and Relief Defendantsâ assets by

prohibiting them from withdrawing, transferring, removing, dissipating, or disposing of any

funds, assets, or other property; and (2) prohibiting Defendants and Relief Defendants from

destroying, altering or disposing of any books and records or other documents.

The Court finds that Commission has made the showing required by Fed. R. Civ. P.

65(b)(1), and in addition, that the Commission has shown that: (1) it is reasonably likely to
Case 1:18-cv-10077-RWZ *SEALED* Document 11 Filed 01/16/18 Page 2 of 9

establish that Defendants Randall Crater, Mark Gillespie, and My Big Coin Pay, Inc. by andâ
through its agents, principals, and control person(s), Gillespie and Crater, (collectively,
âDefendantsâ) have engaged in, are engaging in, and are about to engage in the violations
alleged in the complaint, specifically a fraudulent and deceptive scheme in connection with a ,
virtual currency, a commodity in interstate commerce, in violation of Section 6(c)(1) of the Act,
7U.S.C. Â§ 9(1) (2012), and Commission Regulation (âRegulationâ) 180.1(a),
17 C.F.R. Â§ 180.1(a) (2017); (2) there is a reasonable likelihood that these violations are
ongoing; (3) there is a strong indication that unless restrained and enjoined by Order of this
Court, Defendants may dissipate and conceal assets which could be subject to an order of
disgorgement or an order to pay a civil monetary penalty in this action; and (4) entry of a
temporary restraining order freezing assets is in the public interest.

The Court has considered the pleadings, declarations, exhibits, and memorandum filed in
support of the Commissionâs motion and finds that:

1. This Court has jurisdiction over the parties and over the subject matter of this
action pursuant to Section 6c of the Act.

2s Venue lies properly within this District pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act.

3. There is good cause to believe that Randall Crater, Mark Gillespie, and My Big
Coin Pay, Inc. by and through its agents, principals, and control person(s), Gillespie and Crater,
(collectively, âDefendantsâ) have engaged in, are engaging in, and are about to engage in the
violations alleged in the complaint, specifically a fraudulent and deceptive scheme in connection
with a virtual currency, a commodity in interstate commerce, in violation of Section 6(c)(1) of
the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 9(1) (2012), and Commission Regulation (âRegulationâ) 180.1(a),

17 CFR. Â§ 180.1(a) (2017).
Case 1:18-cv-10077-RWZ *SEALED* Document 11 Filed 01/16/18 Page 3 of 9

- 4, There is good cause to believe that since January 2014, Defendants have engaged
in a deceptive virtual currency scheme, fraudulently soliciting approximately $6 million from at
least twenty-eight individuals. Defendants fraudulently offered for sale to members of the public
My Big Coin (âMBCâ), a virtual currency. To entice people to purchase MBC, Defendants
repeatedly made false and misleading claims and omissions about MBCâs value, usage, trade
status, and financial backing. Contrary to their claims, Defendants misappropriated almost all of
the approximately $6 million they obtained from customers (âMBC Customersâ), and used the
money to fund a lavish lifestyle.

5. There is good cause to believe that Relief Defendants Kimberly Renee Benge;
Kimberly Renee Benge d/b/a Greyshore Advertisement a/k/a Greyshore Advertiset (ââGreyshore
Advertisementâ); Barbara Crater Meeks; Erica Crater; Greyshore, LLC (âGreyshoreâ); and
Greyshore Technology, LLC (ââGreyshore Technologyâ) (collectively, âRelief Defendantsâ) have
received, are receiving, and are about to receive funds, assets or other property as a result of
Defendantsâ violative acts and practices and has been unjustifiably enriched thereby. The Relief
Defendants do not have any legitimate interest or entitlement to these funds, assets or other
property received as a result of Defendantsâ violative conduct.

6. There is good cause to believe that immediate and irreparable damage to the
Courtâs ability to grant effective final relief for customers in the form of monetary redress will
occur from the withdrawal, transfer, removal, dissipation, or other disposition of funds, assets, or
other property or destruction, alteration, or disposition of books and records and other documents
(âtecordsâ) by Defendants and Relief Defendants unless Defendants and Relief Defendants are

immediately restrained and enjoined by Order of the Court.
Case 1:18-cv-10077-RWZ *SEALED* Document 11 Filed 01/16/18 Page 4 of 9

Ts Therefore, there is good cause for the Court to prohibit Defendants and Relief
Defendants from withdrawing, transferring, removing, dissipating, or disposing of any funds,
assets, or other property owned, controlled, managed, or held by Defendants and Relief
Defendants or in which they have any beneficial interest.

8. There is also good cause for entry of an order prohibiting Defendants and Relief
Defendants from destroying, altering, or disposing of records.

9. There is good cause to believe that, absent the entry of this ex parte temporary
restraining order, Defendants and Relief Defendants are likely to transfer or dissipate assets or
destroy or alter business records.

10. This is a proper case for granting a restraining order ex parte to preserve the status
quo, protect public customers from loss and damage, and enable the Commission to fulfill its
statutory duties, therefore the Court orders as follows:
