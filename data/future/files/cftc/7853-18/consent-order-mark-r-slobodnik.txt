THE PARTIES AGREE AND THE COURT HEREBY FINDS:

A. Findings of Fact
The Parties To This Consent Order

16. _ Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an independent federal
regulatory agency that is charged by Congress with administering and enforcing the Act, and the
Regulations.

17. | Defendant Mark R. Slobodnik (âSlobodnikâ) is a resident of Libertyville, Illinois
and was the president, head trader and a principal of Blue Guru. He was a Chicago Mercantile
Exchange (âCMEâ) member for approximately fifteen years until 2011, when he sold his seat on
the exchange. Slobodnik was registered with the CFTC as a floor broker From January 2001 to
August 2013, when his floor broker registration was withdrawn. He was a principal from May
2008 to October 2010 and associated person (âAPâ) from May 2008 to August 2008 of MSLO
Asset Management, LLC, a former registered commodity trading advisor (âCTAâ) and a
principal from September 2016 to October 2017 of MSLO Trading Group, another former
registered CTA.

Solicitation of Pool Participants

18. Slobodnik and a partner established Blue Guru in approximately April 2014 and
began soliciting and accepting funds for Blue Guru shortly thereafter. |

19. Blue Guru was essentially structured as a commodity pool. Prospective and
actual participants were advised that Blue Guru would use their money to trade Dow Jones E-

mini futures and S&P 500 E-mini futures on the CME, and distributed a âConfidential Private
Placement Memorandumâ (âPPMâ) which stated that âwe intend to use the proceeds of the
Offering for buying and selling futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.â

20. As described in the PPM, participation interests in the Pool were structured in the
form of 12-month âNotes,â with âthe principal amount will be paid at maturity, unless earlier
redeemed, and interest will be accrued and paid annually . . . at the rate of 8.0% (eight percent)
per annum, with a payout of 50% (fifty-percent) of the gross net profit from trading profits.â .

21. Moreover, the âRisk Factorsâ section of the PPM states, âWe currently
collaborate with various trading firms and have developed a proprietary model for trading the
financial markets.â It also states âwe are subject to Commodity Trading regulationsâ and that
âwe will be substantially dependent upon our officers, specifically, Mr. Mark Slobodnik and Mr.
Richard Carter, who have significant experience in our business, to carry out our business plan.â
The âBusinessâ section of the PPM states that âTrades will be made in an Omnibus account and
profits and losses are placed into member accounts on a percentage basis.â

22. Slobodnik and his partner solicited respective relatives, friends, business
associates, and others to invest in Blue Guru by various means, including in-person
communication, word-of-mouth and chat rooms. Slobodnik was responsible for bringing in a
minority of participants.

23. During solicitations made by Slobodnik or during which Slobodnik was present,
participants or prospective participants were not informed that Slobodnik had been suspended by
the CME for three months and ordered to pay a $50,000 fine for prearranged trading as part of a
money pass from Slobodnik to another member. See CME BCC 13-9259-BC posted November
20, 2014 Participants and prospective participants also were not informed of Slobodnikâs

partnerâs disciplinary history.
24.  Slobodnik and his partner ultimately solicited and received $1,763,848 from 34
participants who signed Blue Guru subscription agreements. Less than two-thirds of those funds
were used for trading. Some participant funds were used to pay for the redemptions of others.

25. Blue Guru maintained four proprietary accounts at a registered futures
commission merchant (âFCMâ); none was opened as a pool account, and none was profitable. In
aggregate, the four accounts received deposits totaling $1.1 million, sustained $501 000 in
trading losses, paid $62,000 in exchange and clearing fees, and processed $526,000 in
withdrawals, leaving an ending balance of $8,308.09 as of December 31, 2017.

Failure to Trade and Missappropriation of Funds

26. Contrary to the terms of the PPM and Subscription Agreements for Blue Guru,
Slobodnik and his partner did not trade all of the funds that pariticpants invested in Blue Guru, a
portion of which were misappropriated by Slobodnik and his partner.

27. Among other things, Slobodnik deposited $455,000 into the trading accounts, but
withdrew a total of $500,342.44, with the result that Slobodnik received $45,342.44 to which he
was not entitled.

28.  Slobodnik traded one of the four proprietary futures accounts at the FCM, losing
$132,000, and indirectly controlled trading in two other futures accounts that resulted in another
$117,000 in trading losses; thus, Slobodnik was responsible for approximately $249,000 of the
$501,000 trading losses incurred in the four accounts. During at least some communications or
in which Slobodnik directly or indirectly participated, or was present or aware of, Blue Guru
participants were advised that their funds were earning consistent trading profits.

29. | When participants requested to withdraw their funds from Blue Guru, Slobodnik

and/or his partner ignored their demands, engaged in delay tactics, and lied about conditions that

purportedly prevented them from making disbursements. For example, in response to a
December 29, 2017, redemption request from Blue Guruâs largest investor, Slobodnik wrote:
âcan we all just sit down for a few moments when you have a chance so we can all just
understand where we are at? Your money will be returned, but we need to go through our
process. Can we just be decent to each other and not have all this angst. I was in process of
getting my life and ex wife {sic} taken care of and all of sudden all this craziness has happened.
It will be taken care of.â

B. Conclusions of Law

Jurisdiction and Venue

30. This Court possesses jurisdiction over this action pursuant 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1331
(2012) (codifying federal question jurisdiction) and 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1345 (2012) (providing that U.S.
district courts have original jurisdiction over civil actions commenced by the United States or by
any agency expressly authorized to sue by Act of Congress). Section 6c(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
Â§ 13a-1(a) (2012), provides that the Commission may bring actions for injunctive relief or to
enforce compliance with the Act or any rule, regulation, or order thereunder in the proper district
court of the United States whenever it shall appear to the Commission that any person has
engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a violation of any
provision of the Act or any rule, regulation, or order thereunder.

31. | Venue properly lies with this Court pursuant to 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(e), because
Defendant Slobodnik resides in this jurisdiction and the acts and practices in violation of the Act

occurred within this District.

Fraud by Misappropriation and Misrepresentations

32. | By the conduct described above, Slobodnik cheated and defrauded, or attempted
to cheat and defraud, and willfully deceived, or attempted to deceive, prospective and actual
participants by, among other things, knowingly or recklessly:

a. misappropriating participantsâ funds; and
b. making material misrepresentations and omitting material facts to
prospective and actual participants, including that:
i. participant funds would be used to trade commodity futures
contracts in a pooled account(s) at a FCM;
il. participants were earning consistent profits on their investments;
i111. pool participants were guaranteed to earn profits of at least 8%,
annual returns and receive 50% of gross net trading profits, when
Slobidnik and others did not use some or all of participantsâ
investments to trade and had no basis for making these statements;
and
iv. refusing to allow participants to withdraw their funds.
in violation of Section 4b(a)(1)(A) and (C)of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6b(a)(1)(A), (C) (2012).

Fraud by a CPO and AP of a CPO

33. By the conduct described above and in paragraphs 3-19 of the Blue Guru Order,
Blue Guru acted as a CPO in that it engaged in a business that is of the nature of an investment
trust, syndicate or similar form of enterprise operated for the purpose of trading in commodity
interests or commodity futures, and in connection therewith, solicited, accepted and received

funds from others for the purpose of trading in commodity interests and commodity futures.
e PRP AT PNW ew Anes t fis ERS r :
OOP 42> Document # 6? File
PMP EAP REAL ER EE OTP.

34. â By the conduct described above, Slobodnik acted as an AP of Blue Guru by
soliciting funds for the pool and handling participant monies while being associated with Blue
Guru as a partner, officer, employee, consultant, or agent (or person occupying a similar status or
performing similar functions).

35. _ As set forth above and in paragraphs 3-19 of the Blue Guru Order, Slobodnik,
while acting as an AP of a cro, and Blue Guru, while acting as a CPO, defrauded and deceived
participants of Blue Guru by using the mails or any other means of interstate commerce in
violation of Section 40(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 60(1) (2012), by among other things:

a. misappropriating participantsâ funds; and
b. making material misrepresentations and omitting material facts to
prospective and actual participants:

36. As set forth above and in paragraphs 3-19 of the Blue Guru Order, Slobodnik,
while acting as an AP of a CPO, and Blue Guru, while acting as a CPO, defrauded and deceived
participants of Blue Guru by using the mails or any other means of interstate commerce in
violation of 7 U.S.C. Â§ 60(1).

Failure to Register as a CPO

37. By the conduct described in paragraphs 3-19 of the Blue Guru Order, Blue Guru
engaged in activities as a CPO without the benefit of registration as a CPO, and in connection
therewith used the mails or other means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce, in violation
of Section 4m(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6m(1) (2012).

Failure to Register as an AP and Allowing Unregistered APs to Remain Associated
with a CPO

38. By the conduct described above, Slobodnik violated Section 4k(2) of the Act,

7 U.S.C. Â§ 6k(2) (2012), in that he acted as an AP of Blue Guru without the benefit of

registration as an AP of a CPO. By the conduct described in pargraphs 3-19 of the Blue Guru
Order, Blue Guru violated 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6k(2) in that, acting as a CPO, it allowed Slobodnik to act
as an AP when it knew or should have known that Slobodnik was not registered as an AP.

Derivative Liability

39. Slobodnik controlled Blue Guru, directly or indirectly, and did not act in good faith or
knowingly induced, directly or indirectly, Blue Guruâs act or acts in violation of the Act; therefore,
pursuant to Section 13(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13c(b) (2012), Slobodnik is liable for Blue Guruâs
violations of 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6b(a)(1)(A), (C), 60(1), 6m(1) and 6(k)(2).

40. Unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, there is a reasonable likelihood that
Slobodnik will continue to engage in the acts and practices alleged in the Complaint and in

similar acts and practices in violation of the Act and Regulations.

IV. PERMANENT INJUNCTION
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT:
41. | Based upon and in connection with the foregoing conduct, pursuant to Section 6c
of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2012), Slobodnik is permanently restrained, enjoined and

a. in connection with any order to make, or the making of, any contract of
sale of any commodity in interstate commerce or for future delivery that is
made, or to be made, on or subject to the rules of a designated contract

attempting to cheat or defraud such other person; or (C) willfully

Section 4b(a)(1)(A),(C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6b(a)(1)(A),(C) (2012);

b. using the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce,
directly or indirectly, as a commodity pool operator (âCPOâ) or associated

defraud any participant; or (B) engage in any transaction, practice, or
course of business that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any participant,
in violation of Section 40(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 60(1) (2012);

11
failing to register as a CPO in violation of Section 4m(1) of the Act,
7 ULS.C. Â§ 6m(1) (2012); and

failing to register as an AP or permitting an AP to remain unregistered, in
violation of Section 4k(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6k(2) (2012).

42. For five years from the date of entry of this Order, Defendant Slobodnik is also

restrained, enjoined and prohibited from directly or indirectly:

a.

Trading on or subject to the rules of any registered entity (as that term is
defined in Section 1a(40) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1a(40) (2012));

Entering into any transactions involving âcommodity interestsâ (as that term is

entity, whether by power of attorney or otherwise, in any account involving
commodity interests;

Soliciting, receiving or accepting any funds from any person for the purpose

Acting as a principal (as that term is defined in Regulation 3.1(a), 17 C.F.R.

Â§ 3.1(a) (2018)), agent or any other officer or employee of any person (as that
term is defined in Section 1a(38) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1a(38) (2012)),
registered, exempted from registration or required to be registered with the
Commission except as provided for in 17 C.F.R. Â§ 4.14(a)(9).

43.  Slobodnik shall pay restitution in the amount of two hundred and eighty thousand

Order and shall be determined by using the Treasury Bill rate prevailing on the date of entry of
this Consent Order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1961 (2012).

44. To effect payment of the Restitution Obligation and the distribution of any
restitution payments to Defendant Blue Guruâs pool participants, the Court appoints the National
Futures Association (âNFAâ) as Monitor (âMonitorâ). The Monitor shall receive restitution
payments from Slobodnik and make distributions as set forth below. Because the Monitor is
acting as an officer of this Court in performing these services, the NFA shall not be liable for any
action or inaction arising from NFAâs appointment as Monitor, other than actions involving
fraud.

45.  Slobodnik shall make Restitution Obligation payments, and any post-judgment
interest payments, under this Consent Order to the Monitor in the name âMark R. Slobodnik
Restitution Fundâ and shall send such payments by electronic funds transfer, or by U.S. postal
money order, certified check, bank cashierâs check, or bank money order, to the Office of
Administration, National Futures Association, 300 South Riverside Plaza, Suite 1800, Chicago,
Illinois 60606 under cover letter that identifies the paying Defendant and the name and docket
number of this proceeding. Defendant Slobodnik shall simultaneously transmit copies of the
cover letter and the form of payment to the Chief Financial Officer, Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20581.

46. The Monitor shall oversee the Restitution Obligation and shall have the discretion
to determine the manner of distribution of such funds in an equitable fashion to participants
identified by the Commission or may defer distribution until such time as the Monitor deems
appropriate. In the event that the amount of Restitution Obligation payments to the Monitor are

of a de minimis nature such that the Monitor determines that the administrative cost of making a

distribution to eligible participants is impractical, the Monitor may, in its discretion, treat such
restitution payments as civil monetary penalty payments, which the Monitor shall forward to the
Commission following the instructions for civil monetary penalty payments set forth in Part C
below.

47.  Slobodnik shall cooperate with the Monitor as appropriate to provide such
information as the Monitor deems necessary and appropriate to identify Defendant participants to
whom the Monitor, in its sole discretion, may determine to include in any plan for distribution of
any Restitution Obligation payments. Slobodnik shall execute any documents necessary to
release funds that he has in any repository, bank, investment or other financial institution,
wherever located, in order to make partial or total payment toward the Restitution Obligation.

48. | The Monitor shall provide the Commission at the beginning of each calendar year
with a report detailing the disbursement of funds to Blue Guruâs participants during the previous
year. The Monitor shall transmit this report under a cover letter that identifies the name and
docket number of this proceeding to the Chief Financial Officer, Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20581.

49. The amounts payable to each participant shall not limit the ability of any
participant from proving that a greater amount is owed from Slobodnik or any other person or
entity, and nothing herein shall be construed in any way to limit or abridge the rights of any
participant that exist under state or common law.

50. Pursuant to Rule 71 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, each participant of
Blue Guru who suffered a loss is explicitly made an intended third-party beneficiary of this
Consent Order and may seek to enforce obedience of this Consent Order to obtain satisfaction of

any portion of the restitution that has not been paid by Defendant Slobodnik to ensure continued

compliance with any provision of this Consent Order and to hold Slobodnik in contempt for any
violations of any provision of this Consent Order.

51. To the extent that any funds accrue to the U.S. Treasury for satisfaction of
Slobodnikâs Restitution Obligation, such funds shall be transferred to the Monitor for
disbursement in accordance with the procedures set forth above.

B. Disgorgement

52.  Slobodnik shall pay disgorgement in the amount of forty five thousand three
hundred forty two dollars and forty four cents ($45,342.44) (ââDisgorgement Obligationâ),
representing the gains received in connection with such violation(s), plus post-judgment interest.
Post-judgment interest shall accrue on the Disgorgement Obligation beginning on the date of
entry of this Consent Order and shall be determined by using the Treasury Bill rate prevailing on
the date of entry of this Consent Order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1961 (2012).

Commission, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20581.

55. | The Monitor shall oversee the Disgorgement Obligation and shall have the
discretion to determine the manner of distribution of such funds in an equitable fashion to
participants identified by the Commission or may defer distribution until such time as the
Monitor deems appropriate. In the event that the amount of the Disgorgement Obligation
payments to the Monitor are of a de minimis nature such that the Monitor determines that the
administrative cost of making a distribution to eligible participants is impractical, the Monitor
may, in its discretion, treat such disgorgement payments as civil monetary penalty payments,
which the Monitor shall forward to the Commission following the instructions for civil monetary
penalty payments set forth in Part C below.

56.  Slobodnik shall cooperate with the Monitor as appropriate to provide such
information as the Monitor deems necessary and appropriate to identify participants to whom the
Monitor, in its sole discretion, may determine to include in any plan for distribution of any
Disgorgement Obligation payments. Slobodnik shall execute any documents necessary to
release funds that he has in any repository, bank, investment or other financial institution,
wherever located, in order to make partial or total payment toward the Disgorgement Obligation.

57. The Monitor shall provide the Commission at the beginning of each calendar year
with a report detailing the disbursement of funds to Blue Guruâs participants during the previous
year. The Monitor shall transmit this report under a cover letter that identifies the name and
docket number of this proceeding to the Chief Financial Officer, Commodity Futures Trading

Commission, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20581.

58. | The amounts payable to each participant shall not limit the ability of any
participant from proving that a greater amount is owed from Slobodnik or any other person or
entity, and nothing herein shall be construed in any way to limit or abridge the rights of any
participant that exist under state or common law.

59. Pursuant to Rule 71 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, each participant of
Blue Guru who suffered a loss is explicitly made an intended third-party beneficiary of this
Consent Order and may seek to enforce obedience of this Consent Order to obtain satisfaction of
any portion of the disgorgement that has not been paid by Defendant Slobodnik to ensure
continued compliance with any provision of this Consent Order and to hold Slobodnik in
contempt for any violations of any provision of this Consent Order.

60. To the extent that any funds accrue to the U.S. Treasury for satisfaction of
Slobodnikâs Disgorgement Obligation, such funds shall be transferred to the Monitor for
disbursement in accordance with the procedures set forth above.

61. | Slobodnik shall pay a civil monetary penalty in the amount of forty five thousand
three hundred forty two dollars and forty four cents ($45,342.44) (âCMP Obligationâ), plus post-

date of entry of this Consent Order and shall be determined by using the Treasury Bill rate
prevailing on the date of entry of this Consent Order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1961 (2012).

62. Slobodnik shall pay his CMP Obligation by electronic funds transfer, U.S. postal
money order, certified check, bank cashierâs check, or bank money order. If payment is to be
