MONETARY PENALTY AND OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF

I. INTRODUCTION

On March 27, 2013, Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ

 

or âCFTCâ) filed a Complaint (âComplaintâ) against Defendant James Harvey Mason (âMasonâ
or âDefendantâ) and Relief Defendants The JHM Forex Only Pool (f/k/a The JHM Forex Only
Pool, LP), and Forex Trading at Home (âRelief Defendantsâ), seeking injunctive and other
equitable relief, as well as the imposition of civil penalties, for violations of the Commodity
Exchange Act (âCEAâ or âActâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1 ef seq. (2012), and the Commissionâs
Regulations (âRegulationsâ) promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1.1 et seg. (2014) (Dkt. #1).
Specifically, the CFTCâs Complaint alleged that Defendant has violated, and is continuing to

violate, Sections 4b(a)(2)(A) and (C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6b(a)(2)(A) and (C), Sections
4m(1), and 40(1)(A) and (B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6m(1), and 60(1)(A) and (B), and
Regulation 5.3(a)(2), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 5.3(a)(2).

The Court entered an ex parte Statutory Restraining Order (âSROâ) against Defendant
and Relief Defendants on March 27,2013 (kt. #11). The SRO froze assets under Defendantâs
and Relief Defendantsâ control, ordered an accounting of assets, permitted CFTC access to all of
Defendantâs and Relief Defendantsâ books and records, prohibited the destruction of documents,
and appointed Joseph W. Grier III, of Grier, Furr & Crisp, P.A. as the Receiver to, inter alia,
take exclusive custody, control, and possession of all funds, property and other assets in the
possession or control of the Defendant and Relief Defendants, and to perform all acts necessary
to hold, manage, and preserve the value of such assets (collectively, the âReceivership Estateâ).

The Court subsequently entered an Order of Preliminary Injunction (âPreliminary
Injunctionâ) against Defendant and Relief Defendants on May 22, 2013 (Dkt. #22). The
Preliminary Injunction continued the relief granted by the SRO, additionally required the
Defendant and Relief Defendants to submit an accounting, and prohibited the Defendant from

committing further violations of the Act.

Il. CONSENTS AND AGREEMENTS

and/or Relief Defendants in any other proceeding.

Ili. FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Court, being fully advised in the premises, finds that there is good cause for the entry
of this Consent Order and that there is no just reason for delay. The Court therefore directs the
entry of the following Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, permanent injunction and equitable
relief pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1, as set forth herein.

THE PARTIES AGREE AND THE COURT HEREBY FINDS:

A. Findings of Fact
1. The Parties To This Consent Order

14. Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an independent federal
regulatory agency that is charged by Congress with administering and enforcing the Act,
TUS. Â§Â§ | et seq., and the Regulations promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1.1 ef seq.

15. Defendant James Harvey Mason resides in Graham, North Carolina, and also
has an address and conducts business in Mill Spring, North Carolina. Mason has never been
registered with the Commission in any capacity. Mason is facing a concurrent criminal

prosecution in United States v. James Harvey Mason, Case No.: 3:14-cr-122-FDW, filed in the

 
U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina, on charges of securities fraud
conspiracy and filing a false tax return arising out of the same or similar conduct as alleged in the
Complaint. In June, 2014, Mason pled guilty to single counts of securities fraud conspiracy and
filing a false federal tax return for tax year 2011.

16. Relief Defendant The JHM Forex Only Pool (f/k/a The JHM Forex Only Pool,
LP) (âJHMâ), is a commodity pool with business addresses in Snow Camp, Mill Spring, and
Hendersonville, North Carolina. Mason was the general partner of The JHM Forex Only Pool,
LP, and sole proprietor of JHM. JHM operates through several interrelated companies, including
The JHM Forex Only Pool Irrevocable Trust and JHM Holdings, LLC, which were wholly
owned and/or operated by defendant Mason. JHM has never been registered with the
Commission in any capacity. As a Relief Defendant, JHM held pool participantsâ funds in
constructive trust for the participants.!

17. Relief Defendant Forex Trading at Home (âFTAHâ) is a commodity pool with
a business address in Graham, North Carolina. FTAH operates through several interrelated
companies, including âForex Trading at Home Association,â âForex Trading at Home Partners,â
and/or âFTAH Partners,â operated by defendant Mason. FTAH and the interrelated companies
were owned by each of their respective partners, members, or investors. However, Mason was
the registered agent for most, if not all, of the FTAH companies and he was elected by the
members to trade on behalf of FTAH. FTAH has never been registered with the Commission in
any capacity. As a Relief Defendant, FTAH held pool participantsâ funds in constructive trust for

the participants.

' The Receiver has liquidated all remaining assets in the JHM and FTAH pools and consolidated
such funds into the Receivership Estate. Therefore, neither JHM nor FTAH currently hold
participant funds.

 

 
2. Defendantâs Scheme

18. Beginning in at least July 2010, Mason acted as a commodity pool operator
(âCPOâ) and in that capacity he fraudulently solicited, accepted, and pooled at least $5,300,000
from approximately 500 individuals and used the funds to trade off-exchange foreign currency
contracts (âforexâ) in two commodity pools, JHM and FTAH (collectively, the âPoolsââ). Mason
was never registered with the Commission as a CPO.

19, | When soliciting and accepting funds for and/or operating the pools, Mason
intentionally or recklessly provided participants and prospective participants with written
documents that contained materially false or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose
material facts, including: (a) telling participants they would not lose their principal; (b) claiming
that participants would make expected profits of 1.1% per day and as much as 340% to 500%
annually; (c) misrepresenting the significant risk of loss associated with forex trading; and (d)
failing to disclose to all investors that he had been convicted of felony wire fraud in connection
with the purchase and/or sale of commodities in 2000. Additionally, Mason appears to have
misappropriated at least $779,000 of pool participantsâ funds and used such funds for purposes
other than for forex trading.

3. JHM and FTA Pool Solicitations

20. Beginning in at least July 2010 and continuing through at least December 2012,
Mason solicited individuals to become participants in the JHM pool. Mason also permitted and
encouraged other persons to solicit participants in the JHM pool.

21. In about September 2012, Mason began to solicit individuals directly to become
participants in the FTAH pool. Mason also permitted and encouraged other individuals to solicit

participants in the FTAH pool. Mason marketed FTAH to at least some participants as a trading

 

 
system, but claimed that the funds used to purchase the trading system would be placed in the
FTAH pool and used for forex trading.

22, Based upon Masonâs solicitations, approximately 500 participants invested at
least $5,300,000 with JHM and FTAH for the purpose of trading forex. However, Mason pooled
only a portion of the participant funds and placed them in forex trading accounts in JHMâs and
FTAHâs name. Mason deposited the rest of the participant funds in various bank accounts,
withdrew funds as needed to make âPonziâ payments to other participants, and misappropriated
participant funds and used them for personal purposes other than for forex trading.

4. Misrepresentations About Risk and Profit

23. In written communications with participants in both the JHM or FTAH pools,
Mason made numerous fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions. For example, in a
document styled âOperations Policiesâ dated June 11, 2012, which Mason sent to JHM pool
participants, Mason represented that he could guarantee participantsâ funds, and that participants
should consider the âOperations Policy document as a written guarantee that their funds
personally invested are guaranteed by either the Fund Managers earnings or future earnings,
receivables on loans made to other account holders or deposits and assets held in Trust for
account holders benefit.â

24. Similarly, in an October 4, 2012 email to JHM pool participants, Mason promised
participants that if he lived until September 2013, all participants would be able to withdraw their
pool funds. Implicit in this statement was that participants would not lose any money as a result
of Masonâs trading forex.

25, On October 9, 2012, Mason sent an email to JHM participants stating, among
other things, that he âleaves the majority of performance earnings, less necessary operating

capital withdrawals, within the Pool to build a fund that in the future will guarantee one hundred

 

 
(100%) percent of investorâs personally invested capital,â and attached a spreadsheet describing
expected profits from investments for a period of five years. According to the spreadsheet, an
investment of $5,000 could be expected to grow more than 500% annually, meaning that after
five years, the investment was expected to be worth more than $100,000,000.

26. Mason made similar representations with respect to the FTAH pool. For example,
in a July 26, 2012, email, Mason guaranteed that if purchasers of the trading system marketed
through FTAH lost money within their first 90 days of trading, he would refund the full purchase
price. In an August 29, 2012, email to FTAH participants, Mason promised to grow a memberâs
$1,000 deposit through trading activities into a total of $4,400 within a time period of 260
trading days, or one year time frame, equal to a 340% annual return. On September 9, 2012,
Mason further represented that his FTAH trading system was so effective that it âcan âhelp
peopleâ more than any investment they could possibly make anywhere, including getting an
account into the Pool. At $500.00 it can help a lot of people become independent,â and âIt will
help any of your friends and any member of your family, possibly more than any education they
could ever attain.â

5. Misrepresentations about Defendantâs Background

27. Ina biography he provided to participants, Mason described himself as a former
cotton mill manager and owner with over thirty-five (35) years of experience trading commodity
futures and options. However, Mason failed to disclose in his biography that in 2000 he was
convicted of wire fraud in connection with certain cotton trades, or that he was sentenced to
eighteen months in prison and three years of supervised release. Additionally, Mason knew or
recklessly disregarded the fact that he did not possess that many years of experience trading

commodity futures and options.

 

 
6. Defendantâs Trading Losses, False Account Information, and Misappropriation
of Participant Funds

28.  Masonâs forex trading in the JHM and FTAH accounts was not profitable. Mason
lost over $1,120,000 trading between July 2010 and March 2013. Notwithstanding these trading
losses, Mason provided false information to pool participants utilizing internet-based online
accounts which falsely indicated that Mason was making a profit in forex trading.

29. Mason misappropriated at least $779,000 of participant funds and used such funds
for purposes other than forex trading. Mason used participant funds to purchase real estate, cars,
and to pay his personal credit card bills, among other expenses.

7. Defendantâs Failure to Register as a Commodity Pool Operator

30. Defendant has acted as the CPO of JHM and FTAH. With certain exemptions
and exclusions not applicable here, all CPOs are required to be registered with the Commission,
pursuant to the Act and its Regulations. As described above, Defendant, without being
registered with the Commission as a CPO, solicited and accepted funds from pool participants
who were not âeligible contract participantsâ (as defined in the Act), using instrumentalities of
interstate commerce, for the purpose of engaging in retail forex transactions in the JHM and
FTAH pools.

8. Relief Defendants JAM and FTAH Have no Legitimate Interest or Claim to
Participant Funds

31. In order to obtain complete relief for Defendantâs defrauded customers, JHM and
FTAH are named as nominal or relief defendants. JHM and FTAH are appropriate nominal
defendants in this action because they were used as instrumentalities of the Defendantâs acts and
held assets that rightfully belonged to the Defendantâs defrauded investors. JHM and FTAH
each possessed funds illegally obtained by the Defendant and, accordingly, had no legitimate

interest or entitlement to any pool participant funds. Accordingly, the court-appointed Receiver

10

 

 
has liquidated all remaining assets in the JHM and FTAH pools and consolidated such funds into
the Receivership Estate.
B. Conclusions of Law
1. Jurisdiction and Venue

32. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 6c of the Act,
7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1, which provides that whenever it shall appear to the Commission that any
person has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a .
violation of any provision of the Act or any rule, regulation, or order promulgated thereunder, the
Commission may bring an action in the proper district court of the United States against such
person to enjoin such act or practice, or to enforce compliance with the Act, or any rule,
regulation or order thereunder.

33. The Commission has jurisdiction over the forex solicitations and transactions at
issue in this action pursuant to Section 2(c)(2)(C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(c)(2)(C).

34. Venue properly lies with this Court pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
Â§ 13a-1(e), because the Defendant transacted business in this District, and the acts and practices
in violation of the Act occurred within this District.

2. Fraud by Material Misrepresentations, Omissions and Misappropriation of
Participant Funds

35. â By the conduct described in paragraphs 1 through 31 above, Defendant cheated
and defrauded, or attempted to cheat and defraud, and willfully deceived, or attempted to
deceive, his pool participants by, among other things, knowingly or recklessly:
misappropriating pool participantsâ funds and making material misrepresentations and omissions
of material facts to the prospective and actual pool participants in violation of Section

4b(a)(2)(A) and (C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§6b(a)(2)(A) and (C).

il

 

 

 
36. By the conduct described in paragraphs | through 31 above, Defendant used the
mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce while acting as a CPO to employ a
device, scheme or artifice to defraud his pool participants, and engaged in a transaction, practice
or course of business which operated as a fraud upon his pool participants, by, among other
things, knowingly or recklessly: emailing written communications containing fraudulent
misrepresentations and omissions of material facts to both JHM and FTAH participants and
prospective participants, and by misappropriating pool participantsâ funds, in violation of Section
4o(1)(A) and (B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 60(1)(A) and (B).

3. Defendant Failed to Register as a CPO in Violation of Section 4m(1) of the Act and
Regulation 5.3(a)(2)(0

37. By the conduct described in paragraphs 1 through 31 above, Defendant, without
being registered with the Commission, while acting as a CPO, solicited and accepted funds from
pool participants using instrumentalities of interstate commerce, for the purpose of trading forex.
Thus, since October 18, 2010, Defendant has acted as the CPO of JHM and FTAH without being
registered in violation of Section 4m(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6m(1), and Regulation
5.3(a)(2)@), 17 C.F.R. Â§5.3(a)(2)().

4. Permanent Injunctive Relief is Necessary and Appropriate

38. Unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, there is a reasonable likelihood that
the Defendant will continue to engage in the acts and practices alleged in the Complaint and in
similar acts and practices in violation of the Act and Regulations. Permanent injunctive relief is
appropriate in this case because the lengthy nature of Defendantâs misconduct as alleged, and his

previous conviction of wire fraud are suggestive of future violations of the Act.

12

 
IV. PERMANENT INJUNCTION

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT: |

39. Based upon and in connection with the foregoing conduct, pursuant to Section 6c
of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1, Defendant is permanently restrained, enjoined and prohibited from

with, any other person in violation of Section 4b(a)(2)(A) and (C) of the Act,

7 ULS.C. Â§86b(a)(2)(A) and (C), including, but not limited to, misappropriating
funds and making material misrepresentations and omissions in connection with
forex trading;

b. Acting in any capacity requiring registration with the Commission without the
benefit of registration, in violation of Section 4m(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.

Â§Â§ 6m(1), and Regulation 5.3(a)(2)(i), 17 C.F.R. Â§5.3(a)(2)(i), including, but not

limited to, using the mails or other instrumentalities of interstate commerce in

 

connection with CPO business without being registered with the Commission;
and,

c. Using the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce while
acting as a CPO to employ a device, scheme or artifice to defraud any pool
participants, and engaging in a transaction, practice or course of business which
operates as a fraud upon any pool participants in violation of Section 40(1)(A)

and (B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.-Â§Â§ 60(1)(A) and (B).

V. RESTITUTION, CIVIL MONETARY PENALTY AND OTHER EQUITABLE
RELIEF

A. Restitution
41. Defendant shall pay restitution in the amount of three million, eight hundred
eighty thousand dollars ($3,880,000) (âRestitution Obligationâ), plus post-judgment interest,

within ten (10) days of the date of the entry of this Consent Order. If the Restitution Obligation

 

is not paid in full within ten (10) days of the date of entry of this Consent Order, then post-
judgment interest shall accrue on the Restitution Obligation beginning on the date of entry of this
Consent Order and shall be determined by using the Treasury Bill rate prevailing on the date of
entry of this Consent Order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1961.

42. The Court finds that the Defendant likely will be obligated to pay restitution to
victims of his scheme in the concurrent criminal prosecution in United States v. James Harvey
Mason, Case No.: 3:14-cr-122-FDW, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of
North Carolina (âCriminal Caseâ), For amounts disbursed to Defendantâs pool participants and

customers as a result of satisfaction of any restitution ordered in the Criminal Case, the

15
Defendants shall receive a dollar-for-dollar credit against the Restitution Obligation. Within ten
(10) days of disbursement in the Criminal Case to Defendantâs pool participants and customers,
Defendant shall, under a cover letter that identifies the name and docket number of this
proceeding, transmit to the Chief Financial Officer, Commodity Futures Trading Commission,
Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 - 21 Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20581, copies of the form of
payment to those pool participants and customers.

43. The amounts payable to each pool participant and customer shall not limit the
ability of any pool participant and customer from proving that a greater amount is owed from
Defendant or any other person or entity, and nothing herein shall be construed in any way to
limit or abridge the rights of any pool participant and customer that exist under state or common
law.

44. Pursuant to Rule 71 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, each pool participant
and customer of Defendant who suffered a loss is explicitly made an intended third-party
beneficiary of this Consent Order and may seek to enforce obedience of this Consent Order to
obtain satisfaction of any portion of the restitution that has not been paid by Defendant to ensure
continued compliance with any provision of this Consent Order and to hold Defendant in
contempt for any violations of any provision of this Consent Order.

45. Upon the termination of the Receivership Estate, the Receiver shall provide the
Commission with a report detailing the disbursement of any funds to Defendantâs pool
participants. The Receiver shall transmit this report under a cover letter that identifies the name
and docket number of this proceeding to the Chief Financial Officer, Commodity Futures

Trading Commission, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21" Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20581.

16
B. Civil Monetary Penalty

46. Defendant shall pay a civil monetary penalty in the amount of one million, six
hundred seventy thousand dollars ($1,670,000) (âCMP Obligationâ), plus post-judgment interest,
within ten (10) days of the date of the entry of this Consent Order. If the CMP Obligation is not
paid in full within ten (10) days of the date of entry of this Consent Order, then post-judgment
interest shall accrue on the CMP Obligation beginning on the date of entry of this Consent Order
and shall be determined by using the Treasury Bill rate prevailing on the date of entry of this
Consent Order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1961.

47. Defendant shall pay his CMP Obligation by electronic funds transfer, U.S. postal
money order, certified check, bank cashierâs check, or bank money order. If payment is to be
made other than by electronic funds transfer, then the payment shall be made payable to the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission and sent to the address below:
