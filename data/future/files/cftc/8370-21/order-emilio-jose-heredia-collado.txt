ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTION 6(c) AND (d) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, MAKING
FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

L INTRODUCTION

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ) has reason to believe that
Emilio JosÃ© Heredia Collado (âHerediaâ or âRespondentââ) has violated Sections 6(c)(3) and
9(a)(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 9(3), 13(a)(2) (2018), and Regulation 180.2, 17 CFR. Â§ 180.2
(2020) of the Commission Regulations (âRegulationsâ). Therefore, the Commission deems it
appropriate and in the public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are,
instituted to determine whether Respondent engaged in the violations set forth herein and to
determine whether any order should be issued imposing remedial sanctions.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Respondent has
submitted an Offer of Settlement (âOfferâ), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Respondent admits the facts set forth below, acknowledges that his conduct violated the Act and
Regulations, admits the Commissionâs jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of these
proceedings, consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Section 6(c)
and (d) of the Commodity Exchange Act, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions
(âOrderâ) and acknowledges service of this Order.

II. FINDINGS
The Commission finds the following:
A. Summary

From as early as June 2012 through at least August 2016 (âRelevant Periodâ), while
employed as a fuel oil trader in the San Francisco office of a commodity trading firm (âCompany
Aâ) and then the UâS. affiliate of a multinational commodity trading company (âCompany Bâ)
that acquired Company A (collectively, the âTrading Companyâ), Respondent and others at the
Trading Company sought to increase profits from its oil products trading by manipulating a U.S.
price-assessment benchmark relating to physical fuel oil products. Respondent and others
engaged in the manipulation to benefit the Trading Companyâs trading positions.

Respondent engaged in the manipulation, and directed and induced personnel under his
supervision to engage in the manipulation, in order to manipulate the benchmark prices of fuel
oil products reported by S&P Global Platts (âPlattsâ), a price reporting agency, for the purpose
of benefiting the Trading Companyâs related trading positions, including more than
approximately 100 multimillion-dollar oil-product trades with a large, state-owned enterprise
(the âSOEâ) that were priced in reference to a Platts benchmark. Respondent engaged in this
conduct with the specific intent to manipulate the price of a commodity in interstate commerce
and to create artificial prices, and Respondent could and did create artificial prices. By this
conduct, Respondent engaged in attempted manipulation and manipulation, in violation of
Sections 6(c)(3) and 9(a)(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 9(3), 13(a)(2) (2018), and Regulation 180.2,
17 CE.R. Â§ 180.2 (2020).

In accepting Respondentâs Offer, the Commission recognizes Respondentâs entry into a
formal cooperation agreement (âCooperation Agreementâ) with the Division of Enforcement
(âDivisionâ), which sets forth the terms of his agreement to cooperate with the Commission and
the Division in connection with any investigation, litigation, or proceeding to which the
Commission is a party relating to the subject matter of this Order and/or as described in the
Cooperation Agreement.

B. Respondent

Emilio JosÃ© Heredia Collado is a former fuel oil trader who resides in California.
Throughout the Relevant Period, Heredia was a trader at the Trading Company. Heredia has
never been registered with the Commission.

C. Facts

During the Relevant Period, Respondent engaged in and oversaw trading of a variety of
oil products on behalf of the Trading Company, including fuel oil and bunker fuel, a type of fuel
oil.

1. The Trading Activity and Benchmark Exposure

Among other things, the Trading Companyâs trading activities engaged in or overseen by
Respondent included large-quantity trades, sometimes called âcargos,â of fuel oil. Respondent
also oversaw smaller-quantity trades of bunker fuel, sometimes called âbunkers,â typically with
end-users such as ship owners. Among the cargo trades engaged in or overseen by Respondent
were numerous cargo trades with the SOE (the âCargo Tradesâ), including those for delivery to
and from the Los Angeles market.

During the Relevant Period, more than approximately 100 Cargo Trades with the SOE
were priced in reference to a benchmark price assessment determined by Platts called the Bunker
Fuel Oil 380 CST 3.5% Ex-Wharf Los Angeles (the âLos Angeles Bunker Benchmarkâ), plus or
minus a specified dollar amount negotiated by the parties, on specified days (âCargo Pricing
Daysâ). Like other Platts benchmarks, Platts widely reported the daily Los Angeles Bunker
Benchmark as part of its subscription market-reporting services, which information end-users
and other market participants used as price benchmarks in the shipping and bunker industries.

During the Relevant Period, Platts generally determined the Los Angeles Bunker
Benchmark for a given day based primarily on bids to purchase, offers to sell, and trades in
bunker fuel during a defined period of time called the âwindowâ that Platts-authorized market
participants reported to Platts, and which Platts then widely reported to subscribers.! Each day,
before commencement of the trading window, Platts typically reported to market participants a
market price level referred to as the âpeg.â The peg typically served as the starting price at the
beginning of the trading window for Platts-authorized market participantsâ bids or offers. Platts
typically determined the peg in part based on information about trades or other market
information that market participants such as the Trading Company reported to Platts.

On Cargo Pricing Days the Trading Companyâs trading positions generally had
significant price exposure to the Los Angeles Bunker Benchmark. When the Cargo Trades were
sales by the Trading Company to the SOE, the Trading Companyâs Cargo Trade position would
be more profitable if the average Los Angeles Bunker Benchmark on the Cargo Pricing Days
was higher: if the Los Angeles Bunker Benchmark rose, the Trading Company would sell to the
SOE at a higher price. Conversely, when the Cargo Trades were purchases by the Trading
Company from the SOE, the Trading Companyâs Cargo Trade positions would be more
profitable if the average Los Angeles Bunker Benchmark on the Cargo Pricing Days was lower:
if the Los Angeles Bunker Benchmark fell, the Trading Company would buy from the SOE at a
lower price.

2. The Manipulation

During the Relevant Period, Respondent and others at the Trading Company manipulated
the Los Angeles Bunker Benchmark in order to increase the Trading Companyâs profits on the
Cargo Trades priced by reference to the benchmark, including by distorting the prices of the
Cargo Trades in the Trading Companyâs favor. Typically, in furtherance of the manipulation,
Respondent, or others at the Trading Company acting in concert with Respondent, submitted
generally increasing bids or generally decreasing offers to Platts during the trading window,
which Platts then reported to its subscribers. By such conduct, Respondent and others at the
Trading Company intended to create, and did create, artificially high (or artificially low) Los
Angeles Bunker Benchmarks on Cargo Pricing Days not reflective of legitimate forces of supply
and demand, so that the Trading Company could sell cargos to the SOE at artificially high prices
(or buy cargos from the SOE at artificially low prices). Respondent engaged in the price
manipulation, directed and induced personnel under his supervision to engage in the price
manipulation, and observed others at the Trading Company engaging in such conduct with
respect to one or more Platts benchmarks. As a result of the manipulation, the Trading Company
earned significant additional profits or savings.

 

! As relevant to the Los Angeles Bunker Benchmark during the Relevant Period, the bids, offers, and trades reported
in the Los Angeles Bunker Benchmark window were generally for a trade size of 1,000 metric tons of bunker fuel.
3. Examples

The following are two examples of the manipulation. In each example, Respondent acted
with the intent to manipulate the benchmark and create an artificial price, and succeeded in
creating artificial prices.

First, in or around May 2013, the Trading Company entered into a Cargo Trade for the
sale of approximately 40,000 metric tons of fuel oil to the SOE, priced by reference to the
average Los Angeles Bunker Benchmark on May 28, 29, and 30, 2013. Respondent directed a
Trading Company employee to submit bids to Platts during the window, and to increase the
prices of those bids approximately 27 times on May 28, 23 times on May 29, and 9 times on May
30, 2013. This trading activity led to an artificial Los Angeles Bunker Benchmark on each day
that was significantly higher than the dayâs starting peg, to the benefit of the Trading Companyâs
positions in the Cargo Trade that priced on those days.? The Trading Companyâs activity in the
window on the Cargo Pricing Days of May 28, 29, and 30, 2013, resulted in improper additional
revenue to the Trading Company of several hundred thousand dollars.

Second, in or around October 2015, the Trading Company entered into two Cargo Trades
together consisting of the purchase of approximately 40,000 metric tons of fuel oil from the
SOE. Both trades were priced in reference to the average daily Los Angeles Bunker Benchmark
on October 23, 26, and 27, 2015. Respondent directed a Trading Company employee to submit
offers to Platts during the window, and to decrease the prices of those offers approximately 39
times on October 23, 38 times on October 26, and 22 times on October 27, 2015. This trading
activity led to an artificial Los Angeles Bunker Benchmark on each day that was significantly
lower than the dayâs starting peg, to the benefit of the Trading Companyâs positions in the Cargo
Trades that priced on those days.*? The Trading Companyâs activity in the window on the Cargo
Pricing Days of October 23, 26, and 27, 2015, resulted in improper savings to the Trading
Company of more than several hundred thousand dollars.

4, Cooperation

Respondent has entered into the Cooperation Agreement with the Division setting forth
the terms of his agreement to cooperate with the Commission and the Division in connection
with any investigation, litigation, or proceeding to which the Commission is a party relating to
the subject matter of this Order and/or as described in the Cooperation Agreement.

 

2 On May 28, 2013, Platts assessed the Los Angeles Bunker Benchmark at or around $26.50 above the dayâs starting
peg of $585 per metric ton. On May 29, 2013, Platts assessed the Los Angeles Bunker Benchmark at $23.00 above
the dayâs starting peg of $607.50 per metric ton. And on May 30, 2013, Platts assessed the Los Angeles Bunker
Benchmark at $8.50 above the dayâs starting peg of $628.50 per metric ton. The Los Angeles Bunker Benchmark
thus was assessed at an average of $19.33 above the peg on those three days.

3 On October 23, 2015, Platts assessed the Los Angeles Bunker Benchmark at $39.50 below the dayâs starting peg of
$230 per metric ton. On October 26, 2015, Platts assessed the Los Angeles Bunker Benchmark at $38.00 below the
dayâs starting peg of $230 per metric ton. On October 27, 2015, Platts assessed the Los Angeles Bunker Benchmark
at $22.00 below the dayâs starting peg of $210 per metric ton. The Los Angeles Bunker Benchmark was assessed at
an average of $33.17 below the peg on those three days.
if. LEGAL DISCUSSION

A. Price Manipulation in Violation of Sections 6(c)(3) and 9(a)(2) of the Act, and
Regulation 180.2

Section 9(a)(2) of the Act makes it unlawful for â[a]ny person to manipulate or attempt to

manipulate the price of any commodity in interstate commerce, or for future delivery on or
subject to the rules of any registered entity.â 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13(a)(2) (2018).

Section 6(c)(3) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 9(3) (2018), prohibits the manipulation or
attempted manipulation of the price of any swap, or of any commodity in interstate commerce, or
for future delivery on or subject to the rules of any registered entity, and Regulation 180.2 makes
it âunlawful .. . directly or indirectly, to manipulate or attempt to manipulate the price of any
swap, or of any commodity in interstate commerce, or for future delivery on or subject to the
rules of any registered entity.â 17 C.F.R. Â§ 180.2 (2020).

Respondent specifically intended to manipulate the Los Angles Bunker Benchmark, in
order to benefit, among other things, the Trading Companyâs contracts with SOE that were
priced in reference to the Los Angles Bunker Benchmark. In furtherance of that intent,
Respondent, directly and indirectly (such as through others), submitted bids, offers, and trades to
Platts during the Los Angles Bunker Benchmark trading window in order to skew the Platts
benchmark, and consequently the value of the Trading Companyâs Cargo Trade positions that
were priced in reference to the benchmark, in the Trading Companyâs favor. Through these
actions, Respondent and others at the Trading Company could and did cause artificial prices in
the Los Angeles Bunker Benchmark and thus the Cargo Trades. By this conduct, Respondent
violated Sections 6(c)(3) and 9(a)(2) of the Act and Regulation 180.2.

IV. FINDINGS OF VIOLATIONS

Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that Respondent violated Sections 6(c)(3)
and 9(a)(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 9(3), 13(a)(2) (2018), and Regulation 180.2,
17 CE.R. Â§ 180.2 (2020).
