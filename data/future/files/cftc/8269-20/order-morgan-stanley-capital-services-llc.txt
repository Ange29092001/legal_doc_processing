ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTION 6(c) AND (d) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, MAKING
FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

I. INTRODUCTION

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ) has reason to believe that
since becoming provisionally registered as a swap dealer on December 31, 2012, Morgan
Stanley Capital Services LLC (âMorgan Stanleyâ or âRespondentâ) violated Sections 2(a)(13)(F)
and (G) of the Commodity Exchange Act (the âActââ), 7 U.S.C. 88 2(a)(13)(F), (G) (2018), and
Commission Regulations (âRegulationsâ) 43.3(a), 45.3, 45.4, 45.5, and 45.6, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§
43.3(a), 45.3, 45.4, 45.5, 45.6 (2019). Therefore, the Commission deems it appropriate and in
the public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted to
determine whether Respondent engaged in the violations set forth herein and to determine
whether any order should be issued imposing remedial sanctions.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Respondent has
submitted an Offer of Settlement (âOfferâ), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Without admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, Respondent consents to
the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Section 6(c) and (d) of the Commodity
Exchange Act, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (âOrderâ) and acknowledges
service of this Order.!

 

! Respondent consents to the use of the findings of fact and conclusions of law in this Order in this

proceeding and in any other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party or
claimant, and agrees that they shall be taken as true and correct and be given preclusive effect therein, without
further proof. Respondent does not consent, however, to the use of this Order, or the findings or conclusions herein,
as the sole basis for any other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party or
claimant, other than: a proceeding in bankruptcy or receivership; or a proceeding to enforce the terms of this Order.
Respondent does not consent to the use of the Offer or this Order, or the findings or conclusions in this Order, by
any other party in any other proceeding.
Il. FINDINGS

The Commission finds the following:
A. SUMMARY

Reporting is at the heart of the Commissionâs market and financial surveillance
programs, which are critical to the Commissionâs mission to protect market participants and
promote market integrity, and helps it to fulfill its Congressional mandate of monitoring systemic
risk. Accurate swap data is essential to effective fulfillment of the regulatory functions of the
Commission, including meaningful surveillance and enforcement programs.

As a provisionally registered swap dealer (âSDâ), Respondent, as well as nine of its
affiliates,â all of which were also provisionally registered swap dealers, was required to comply
with certain reporting requirements related to their swap transactions. Since becoming a
provisionally registered SD, Respondent failed to accurately report certain data to a swap data
repository (âSDRâ) under Part 43 or Part 45 of the Regulations. For example, Respondent
submitted hundreds of thousands of swaps containing inaccurate data for certain primary
economic terms (âPETâ) data fields,â including fields for Unique Swap Identifiers (âUSIsâ),
Legal Entity Identifiers (âLEIsââ), notional amounts, execution venue, and price. In addition,
Respondent reported nearly half of its swaps for one asset class to the SDR outside of the time
parameters required by Part 43 of the Regulations.

In accepting Morgan Stanleyâs Offer, the Commission recognizes Morgan Stanleyâs
substantial cooperation with the Division of Enforcementâs (âDivisionââ) investigation of this
matter in the form of a reduced civil monetary penalty.

B. RESPONDENT

Morgan Stanley Capital Services LLC is a Delaware limited liability company with its
principal place of business in New York, New York, and has been provisionally registered as a
swap dealer with the Commission since December 31, 2012.

 

2 The nine affiliates are Morgan Stanley & Co. International PLC, Morgan Stanley Capital Products LLC,

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, Morgan Stanley Bank NA, Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc., Morgan Stanley Bank
International Limited, Morgan Stanley Mexico Casa De Bolsa SA De CV, Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities Co.,
Ltd., and Morgan Stanley Derivative Products Inc. (which deregistered in 2017). Respondent and these affiliates
shared the same swap data reporting system. As a result, the swap data errors identified in this Order include the
swap data reporting errors of Respondentâs nine affiliates.

3 PET data reporting includes the reporting of approximately sixty swap data elements, varying by asset
class, enumerated in appendix | to part 45.

C. FACTS
1. Respondentâs Misreporting of Certain Swap Data

As a provisionally registered SD, Respondent is a reporting counterparty and thus is
required to report certain data about swap transactions to an SDR. Since December 31, 2012,
Respondent inaccurately reported swap data under Part 43 or Part 45 of the Regulations in one
required data fieldâand sometimes in multiple required data fieldsâfor at least approximately
three million swaps. On some days, these errors impacted hundreds of thousands of swaps,
across all five asset classes.â

The errors stem from twenty-nine issues that resulted in Respondentâs omission of swap
data or submission of inaccurate swap data to the SDR, and, consequently, potentially impeded
the Commissionâs ability to properly oversee the swap markets.

In general, Respondentâs swap data reporting errors included the failure to report accurate
PET data for the following fields, among others: (1) the LEI field, a unique code assigned to
swap counterparties and entities in accordance with the standards set by the Global Legal Entity
Identifier System; (2) the USI field, a unique alphanumeric code generated for each swap, and
used by the Commission to follow the swap throughout its life cycle, among other things; (3)
notional amounts; (4) execution venue LEI; and (5) price notation.

Respondentâs swap reporting system generated reporting errors in each of the five asset
classes. For example:

e More than 1 million FX option and cash swaps were reported without required swap-
execution-facility (âSEFââ) identifiers or correct price notations;

e More than 700,000 equity swaps were reported without valuation data for certain life
cycle events or with incorrect valuations;

e More than 360,000 credit swaps were reported with inaccurate effective dates or without
required SEF identifiers, and thousands of credit swaps (relating to pre-allocated block
trades and pre-cleared trades) were reported without an accurate LEI;

e More than 800,000 rates swaps were reported with omissions or errors. For example,
approximately 340,000 swaps were reported as allocated trades without the USI of the
initial block trade. In addition, approximately 275,000 swaps were reported with the
incorrect effective date. Respondent also relied on a third-party to report valuations for
certain swaps, but valuations for approximately 275,000 swaps were not reported at all.
Finally, thousands of rates swaps (relating to pre-allocated block trades and pre-cleared
trades) were reported without an accurate LEI; and

 

4 The term âasset classâ refers to the âbroad category of goods, services or commodities . . . with common

characteristics underlying a swap.â Regulation 45.1, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 45.1 (2019). The asset classes include credit,
equity, foreign exchange (excluding cross-currency) (âFXâ), interest rates (including cross-currency) (âratesâ), other
commodity (âcommoditiesâ), and other such asset classes as may be determined by the Commission.â /d.

3
e More than 100,000 commodity swaps were reported with omissions or errors.
Specifically, more than 80,000 commodity swaps were reported without notional
information for the floating leg of the swap. In addition, approximately 25,000 swaps
were reported with a negative notional amount.

2. Respondentâs Late Reporting of Swap Data

As a provisionally registered swap dealer, Respondent is required to comply with certain
requirements for the real-time public reporting and public availability of swap transaction data,
including the requirement to report a publicly reportable swap transaction to an SDR as soon as
technologically practicable after the swap transaction 1s executed. However, Respondent repeatedly
failed to do so with respect to swaps in at least one asset class. For example, at least as of February
2019, Respondent reported nearly half of its new interest rate swaps more than fifteen minutes after
execution. This percentage was even higher for Respondentâs reporting of post-trade allocation
events.

3. Respondentâs Cooperation

At the outset of the Divisionâs investigation and on its own initiative Respondent hired an
outside expert to review its swap data reporting, and advised the Division that it had done so.
Respondent thereafter voluntarily provided the Division with updates on the status of that
review, and ultimately with the complete results of that review, which included the issues
identified above. Respondent also engaged in open and regular communication with the
Division throughout the investigation, and performed significant additional analyses of
Respondentâs swap reporting at the Divisionâs requests. Respondentâs cooperation allowed the
Division to conserve time and substantial resources.

Hil. LEGAL DISCUSSION

The Act states that, with regard to real-time data, â[p]arties to a swap... shall be
responsible for reporting swap transaction information to the appropriate registered entity in a
timely manner as may be prescribed by the Commission.â Section 2(a)(13)(F) of the Act,

7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(a)(13)(F) (2018). The Act also requires that real-time data for each reportable
swap (whether cleared? or uncleared) be reported to a registered SDR. Section 2(a)(13)(G) of
the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(a)(13)(G) (2018).

Specifically, Regulation 43.4(a) states that â[s]wap transaction and pricing information
shall be reported to a registered [SDR] so that the [SDR] can publicly disseminate swap
transaction and pricing data in real-timeâ in the form and manner set forth in appendix A to
Part 43. 17 C.F.R. Â§ 43.4(a) (2019). Further, â[a] reporting party shall report any publicly
reportable swap transaction to a registered [SDR] as soon as technologically practicableÂ® after

 

> A âcleared swapâ is defined as âany swap that is, directly or indirectly, submitted to and cleared by a

derivatives clearing organization.â Section la(7) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1la(7) (2018).

6 The phrase âas soon as technologically practicableâ means âas soon as possible, taking into consideration

the prevalence, implementation, and use of technology by comparable market participants.â Regulation 43.2,
17 C_F.R. Â§ 43.2 (2019). Moreover, in the preamble to Part 43, the Commission acknowledged that swap dealers are

4
such publicly reportable swap transaction is executed.â Regulation 43.3(a)(1),17 C.F.R.
Â§ 43.3(a)(1) (2019).

Regulation 45.3(b)(1)() and (c) set forth the requirements for reporting creation data,
including PET data, including LEIs and USIs, among other fields. 17 C.F.R. 88 45.3(b)(1)Q), (c)
(2019).

Regulation 45.4(d)(1)(i) requires registered entities and swap counterparties to report
continuation data for uncleared swaps, including the requirement to report life cycle event data
such as LEIs. 17 C.F.R. Â§ 45.4(d)(1)G) (2019). In addition, Regulation 45.4(d)(2)(1) requires
registered entities to report end-of-day valuation data for uncleared swaps.â 17 C.F.R.

Â§ 45.4(d)(2)G) (2019).

Under Regulation 45.5(b), for each off-facility swap where the reporting counterparty is a
swap dealer, the swap dealer is required to create and transmit a USI. 17 C.F.R. Â§ 45.5(b)
(2019). In addition, â[e]ach swap subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission shall be
identified in all recordkeeping and all swap data reporting... by the use of a [USI], which shall be
created, transmitted, and used for each swap as provided in...this section.â 17 C.F.R. Â§ 45.5.

Reporting counterparties are also required to report valid LEIs for each counterparty to a
reportable swap transaction pursuant to Regulation 45.1. In addition, Regulation 45.6 states that
ââTe]ach counterparty to any swap subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission shall be identified
in all recordkeeping and all swap data reporting pursuant to this part by means of a single [LEI].â
17 C.F.R. Â§ 45.6 (2019).

âThe accuracy and completeness of swap reporting are critical to the Commissionâs
mission to protect market participants and to ensure market integrity.â U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commân y. Deutsche Bank AG, No. 1:16-cv-6544 (WHP), 2020 WL 4611985, at *8
(S.D.N.Y. June 17, 2020) (citing In re SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©ralÃ© Intâ! Ltd., CFTC No. 19-38, 2019 WL
4915485, at *6 (Sept. 30, 2019) (consent order) (collecting cases). Market participants rely
upon the public availability of swap data for price discovery purposes. Jd. The Commission, in
turn, requires complete and accurate reporting data to engage in meaningful oversight of the
swaps market. Id.

As set forth above, Respondent failed to accurately report certain swap data. Asa
result, Respondent violated 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 2(a)(13)(F) and (G), and 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 43.3(a), 45.3,
45.4, 45.5, and 45.6.

 

âmore likely to have the infrastructure to report their swap transaction and pricing data to an SDR faster than other
categories of market participants.â 77 Fed. Reg. 1182 (Jan. 9, 2012).

7 The term âvaluation dataâ includes âall of the data elements necessary to fully describe the daily mark of

the transaction, pursuant to [7 U.S.C. Â§ 6s(h)(3)(B) Git], and to [17 C.F.R. Â§ 23.431] of this chapter if applicable.â
Regulation 45.1, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 45.1 (2019).
IV. FINDINGS OF VIOLATIONS

Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that Respondent violated Sections
2(a)(13)(F) and (G) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 2(a)(13)(F), (G) (2018), and Regulations 43.3(a),
45.3, 45.4, 45.5, and 45.6, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 43.3(a), 45.3, 45.4, 45.5, 45.6 (2019).

1.

Public Statements: Respondent agrees that neither it nor any of its successors and
assigns, agents, or employees under its authority or control shall take any action
or make any public statement denying, directly or indirectly, any findings or
conclusions in this Order or creating, or tending to create, the impression that this
Order is without a factual basis; provided, however, that nothing in this provision

Undertaking: The Commission understands that Respondent represents that it and
its affiliates have made significant efforts to remediate the swap data reporting
errors that are the subject of this Order.
To establish that those remediation efforts have been successful, within 60 days of
the entry of this Order, Respondent shall retain at its own expense, in consultation
with and subject to the approval of the Division, a qualified outside consultant
(the âConsultantââ), to perform a review to verify that Respondent has remediated
the root causes of the twenty-nine swap data issues specified in Section II.C.1. of
this Order (the âIssuesââ).

The Consultant shall perform the review of the remediation of the Issues by
sampling up to three days of swap reporting data of Respondent and its affiliates
such that in the discretion of the Consultant it shall have sufficient data to perform
its review.

Within 180 days of being retained, the Consultant shall complete its review and
communicate the final results in a written report (âReportââ) to Respondent and the
Division, which shall include an explanation of the Consultantâs methodology and
any assumptions it has applied, and the results of the review. The Consultantâs
work product and Consultantâs communications with Respondent and its affiliates
shall be made available promptly to the Division upon the Divisionâs request.

Within 9 months after receiving the Report, Respondent shall remediate the root
causes of any deficiencies identified in the Report unless (1) within 60 days after
receiving the Report, Respondent advises the Consultant and the Division that
Respondent disputes the Consultantâs determination that one or more deficiencies
exist, and (11) the Consultant agrees with Respondent and notifies the Division
that it is withdrawing its determination. If after this 60-day period the Consultant
determines a deficiency still exists, Respondent shall remediate the root cause of
any such deficiency unless the Division concludes that remediation is not
necessary.

The Division shall not recommend to the Commission an enforcement action
against Respondent or its affiliates identified in footnote 2 above for violations of
the Act or Regulations based on any such deficiency so long as (1) within 9
months after receiving the Report, Respondent verifies to the Division in writing
that it has remediated the root cause of any such deficiency including by noting
the root cause of the deficiency and the date of the remediation or (11) the Division
concludes that remediation is not necessary.

Upon request by Respondent, the Division shall have the discretion to extend the
time periods in this paragraph 5.
The provisions of this Order shall be effective as of this date.

By the Commission.
