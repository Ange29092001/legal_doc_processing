A. Findings of Fact

17. Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ) is an
independent federal regulatory agency that is charged by Congress with administering and

enforcing the Act and the Regulations.
18. From March 2013 and continuing through December 15, 2016, Defendant Erez

2. Other Relevant Parties

19. Defendant Omega Knight 2, LLC (âOmega Knightâ) is a New York limited

Dynamic,

4, Summary

24. During the Relevant Period, Omega Knight, by and through the actions of its
employees and agents, including Eric Hen, engaged in a scheme to defraud customers located
throughout the United States in connection with precious metals transactions.

25. Omega Knight offered to enter into, and conducted an office or business in the
United States for the purpose of soliciting or accepting orders for, the purchase or sale of
precious metals from customers on a leveraged or financed basis (collectively, âleveraged
precious metals transactionsâ or âretail commodity transactionsâ) and on a fully-paid basis
. (âfully-paid precious metals transactionsâ).

26. Omega Knight, through its employees and agents, including Eric Hen, made
numerous false statements to induce customers to enter into leveraged and fully-paid precious
metals transactions, and Omega Knight received at least $5.5 million from at least 90 customers

in connection with these transactions.
27 . Omega Knightâs leveraged precious metals transactions never resulted in actual
delivery of the full amount of metal purchased to customers. In addition, Omega Knight used
only part of the total funds collected from customers to purchase precious metals for those
customersâ fully-paid precious metals transactions.

28. Instead, Aviv Hen, on behalf of Omega Knight, misappropriated customer funds
to pay personal expenses, to distribute purported âprofitsâ and disbursements to other customers,
and to fund Omega Knightâs operations.

29. Through the issuance of false trade confirmations and account statements and
other communications to customers, Omega Knight and Aviv Hen concealed their
misappropriation and fraudulent scheme.

30.  Inaddition, Omega Knightâs leveraged precious metals transactions constituted
illegal, off-exchange retail commodity transactions.

31. Eric Hen resigned from Omega Knight on December 15, 2016.

5. Phase I of Omega Knightâs Fraudulent Scheme (2013-2016)

32. In 2013, Omega Knight began soliciting customers for precious metals
transactions.

33. In August 2014, Omega Knight entered into a formal agreement (âLeveraged
Metals Agreementâ) with a Florida-based precious metals refinery (âFlorida Refineryâ) to
facilitate the sale of leveraged precious metals to Omega Knight customers. Aviv Hen signed the
Leveraged Metals Agreement with the Florida Refinery on behalf of Omega Knight.

34. The Leveraged Metals Agreement provided that Omega Knight could purchase
precious metal on a leveraged basis from the Florida Refinery for resale to Omega Knightâs

customers.
35. Pursuant to the Leveraged Metals Agreement, Omega Knight created operational
sub-accounts under Omega Knightâs Florida Refinery client ID to allow for segregation of
Omega Knightâs leveraged customer accounts. All of these sub-accounts were in the name of,
and controlled by, Omega Knight.

36. Omega Knight contracted with all its customers and, therefore, directly interacted
with these leveraged precious metals customers on all transactions. Omega Knight was, per the
Leveraged Metals Agreement, responsible for all margin payments, finance, and storage charges
owed to the Florida Refinery.

37. | When Omega Knight sold customers metal on a leveraged basis, it did not deliver
the full amount of purchased metal to those customers.

38. Some leveraged customers did not take delivery of any metal, but were told that
Omega Knight would store their entire metal purchase for them.

39. During Phase I, Omega Knight, through the actions of its employees and agents,
including Eric Hen, made misrepresentations to induce customers to enter into fully-paid and
leveraged precious metals transactions, as further described below.

40. Omega Knight also overstated the amount of interest and fees accrued by
customer accounts to.conceal its misappropriation of customer funds.

6. Misappropriation of Customer Funds During Phase I

41. Omega Knight and Aviv Hen did not invest the full amount of money Omega
Knight received from customers, but instead misappropriated customer funds for personal
expenditures.

42. Funds collected from customers during Phase I were deposited in Omega

Knightâs bank accounts (the âPhase I bank accountsâ) by Aviv Hen.
43. Omega Knight and Aviv Hen used customer funds deposited in the Phase I bank
accounts for a variety of expenditures unrelated to customersâ precious metals transactions.

44, Additionally, Aviv Hen transferred over $200,000 of customer money, from the
Phase I bank accounts, to âE Hen, Inc.â and âWaterbridge Groupâ bank accounts controlled by
Eric Hen.

45. In April 2016, shortly after a customer complained to the Florida Refinery that
Omega Knight was refusing to deliver the silver he purchased, the Florida Refinery terminated

its business relationship with Omega Knight.

7. Phase II of Omega Knightâs Fraudulent Scheme (April 2016 Through at
Least June 2017)

46. After the Florida Refinery terminated its relationship with Omega Knight, Omega
Knight entered into a new agreement with a Texas-based Refinery (âTexas Refineryâ) and a
depository associated with the Texas Refinery.

47. Omega Knightâs agreement with the Texas Refinery did not provide for leveraged
precious metals transactions. Moreover, Omega Knightâs arrangement with the Texas Refinery
did not provide for segregated accounts linked to specific Omega Knight customers.

48. Omega Knight, through its employees and agents, including Eric Hen,
nonetheless continued to solicit customers for precious metals transactions.

49. When Omega Knight sold customers precious metal on a fully-paid basis, it
collected the full purchase price of the metal, but sometimes failed to deliver any purchased
metal (or failed to deliver the full amount of purchased metal) to them. Instead, Omega Knight
told those customers that it would buy and store their precious metal purchase for them.

50. On at least one occasion, Omega Knight falsely represented, through its agent

Eric Hen, that it would buy and store a fully-paid customerâs precious metals purchase. In fact,
t
Omega Knight did not purchase the full amount of metal for this customer and failed to store any
metal whatsoever in a segregated account for this customer. When the customer attempted to
liquidate his investment, Omega Knight refused to return any of the customerâs funds.

51. Omega Knight did not maintain segregated accounts linked to specific customers
during Phase II.

52. Funds collected from customers during Phase II were deposited in Omega
Knightâs bank accounts (the âPhase II bank accountsâ).

53. During Phase I], Omega Knight customer funds were commingled in the Phase II

bank accounts with other funds unrelated to Omega Knightâs business operations.

8. Misappropriation of Customer Funds During Phase II
54. | Omega Knight used funds deposited in the Phase Hf bank accounts for a variety of

expenditures unrelated to their customersâ precious metals transactions.
55. Additionally, Aviv Hen transferred over $30,000, from the Phase II bank
accounts, to a âWaterbridge Groupâ bank account controlled by Eric Hen.

B. Conclusions of Law

56. This Court has jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1331 (2012)
