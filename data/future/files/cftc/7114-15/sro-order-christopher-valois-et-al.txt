Application for Ex Parte Statutory Restraining Order, Plaintiff's Memorandum of
Points and Authorities in Support of Its Application for Ex Parte Statutory
Restraining Order and Motion for a Preliminary Injunction (âMemorandumâ), and
Appendix to Plaintiff's Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Its
Application for Ex Parte Statutory Restraining Order and Motion for a Preliminary
Injunction,

THE COURT FINDS:

1. This Court has jurisdiction over the parties and subject matter of this
action. Section 6c of the Commodity Exchange Act (âActâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§13a-1(a)
(2012), authorizes this Court to enter an ex parte statutory restraining order against
Defendants Christopher Valois (Valois), Cynthia Wong (âWongâ), Bertram Trade
LLC (âBertram Tradeâ) and Churchhill Commodities Trading LLC (ââChurchhillâ)
(collectively âDefendantsâ).

2. Venue properly lies with this Court pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the
Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(e).

3. It appears that there is good cause to believe that Defendants have
engaged, are engaging, or are about to engage in violations of the Act. Specifically,
it appears that Defendants have engaged, are engaging, or are about to engage in
violations of Sections 4(a) and 4b(a)(2)(A) and (C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6(a) and
6b(a)(2)(A) and (C), and that Defendants Valois and Wong also have engaged, are

engaging, or are about to engage in violations of Sections 4b(a)(1)(A) and (C),

40(1)(A) and (B) (2012),

4, It further appears that there is good cause to believe immediate and
irreparable harm to the Courtâs ability to grant effective final relief to Defendantsâ
customers in the form of monetary redress will occur from the sale, transfer,
assignment, or other disposition by Defendantsâ assets or destruction of books
and records unless they are immediately restrained and enjoined by order of the
Court. Accordingly, there is good cause to issue this Order.

5. Consequently, the Court is satisfied that this is a proper case for
granting an ex parte statutory restraining order to preserve the status quo and to
protect public investors from further fraud, deceit, loss or damage, and enable the
Commission to fulfill its statutory duties. It further appears that the interest of
Justice requires that the ex parte application be heard without notice and that the

notice requirement of L.R. 7-19.1 is waived.
