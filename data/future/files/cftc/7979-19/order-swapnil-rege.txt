ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTION 6(c) AND (d) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, MAKING
FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

I, INTRODUCTION

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ) has reason to believe that
from in or about June 2016 through April 2017 (âRelevant Periodâ), Swapnil Rege
(âRespondentâ) violated Section 6(c)(1) of the Commodity Exchange Act (âActâ), 7 U.S.C.

Â§ 9(1) (2012), and Regulation 180.1(a)(1)-(3), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 180.1(a)(1)â(3) (2018), of the
Commission Regulations (âRegulationsâ) promulgated thereunder. Therefore, the Commission
deems it appropriate and in the public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and
hereby are, instituted to determine whether Respondent engaged in the violations set forth herein
and to determine whether any order should be issued imposing remedial sanctions.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Respondent has
submitted an Offer of Settlement (âOfferâ), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Without admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, Respondent consents to
the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Section 6(c) and (d) of the Commodity
Exchange Act, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (âOrderââ) and acknowledges
service of this Order.â

 

' Respondent consents to the use of the findings of fact and conclusions of law in this Order in this proceeding and
in any other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party or claimant, and agrees
that they shall be taken as true and correct and be given preclusive effect therein, without further proof. Respondent
does not consent, however, to the use of this Order, or the findings or conclusions herein, as the sole basis for any
other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party or claimant, other than: a
proceeding in bankruptcy or receivership; or a proceeding to enforce the terms of this Order. Respondent does not
consent to the use of the Offer or this Order, or the findings or conclusions in this Order, by any other party in any
other proceeding.
Il. FINDINGS
The Commission finds the following:
A. SUMMARY

During the Relevant Period, Respondent engaged in a fraudulent scheme to mismark the
valuations for certain interest rate swaps on the books of his employer, a commodity pool
operator (âCPOâ) located in Connecticut and registered as such with the Commission.
Respondent mismarked the valuations in an attempt to artificially inflate the profits of the CPO,
in order to meet performance metrics that would qualify Respondent for an (artificially inflated)
performance bonus. As discussed in further detail below, Respondent mismarked the interest
rate swaps on the books of the CPO by editing default discount curves in the software used by
the CPO to value its swaps, as well as changing other settings in order to create fictitious profits.
As a result of the mismarking scheme, Respondent caused the CPO to overstate its reported
performance to pool participants, which in turn resulted in overstated management fees. The
valuations could not be and were not realized by the CPO.

Respondent engaged in numerous steps to conceal his misconduct, including by:

(1) obtaining written verifications of his fraudulent marks from swap dealers by instructing them
to use off-market forward curvesâand then concealing those instructions when providing the
verifications to the CPOâs back office (accounting and/or operations staff); and (ii) manipulating
the split of spreads and fees assigned to the various legs of packaged swaps transactions to make
it appear that swaps were unwound close to his fictitious marks. Respondent also engaged in
efforts to persuade management of the CPO, as well as the CPOâs outside auditor, that his marks
were not fraudulentâdespite knowing that they were unsupportable.

The CPO ultimately terminated Respondent, liquidated its commodity pools, restated the
poolsâ valuations, and reimbursed excessive fund management fees attributable to Respondentâs
mismarking scheme.

B. RESPONDENT

Swapnil Rege was a Portfolio Manager on the U.S. Rates Desk at the CPO from June
2015 until his termination in April 2017. Rege has never been registered with the Commission
in any capacity.

C. OTHER RELEVANT ENTITIES

The CPO is a Delaware limited liability company with a principal place of business in
Darien, Connecticut. During the Relevant Period, the CPO was registered with the Commission
as a CPO. The CPO operated several commodity pools during the Relevant Period.

D. FACTS

Respondent was hired as a consultant by the CPO in March 2015. In June 2015
Respondent was promoted to a full-time employee as Portfolio Manager over the U.S. Rates
Desk. The terms of the management of the commodity pools were set forth in a private
placement memorandum and other documents.

At the time Respondent was hired, the CPO primarily invested in structured products
such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, and fixed income instruments. The
CPO typically entered into interest rate swaps and other derivatives for hedging purposes.
Respondent was hired to engage in a new primary investment strategy of interest rate swap
trading (i.e., trading to earn profits by entering into interest rate swaps, as well as swaptions and
other related instruments, rather than for hedging purposes). Pursuant to his agreement with the
CPO, Respondent was paid a base salary of $150,000, and was entitled to a performance bonus
of 8% of the CPOâs net profits generated by his trading. Respondent was the primary trader for
this new strategy.

Initially, these swaps and related instruments were valued on the CPOâs books by
marking them on a day-to-day basis using a valuation model for each instrument. Doing so
requires that the economic terms of each instrument be manually input by the trader (here,
Respondent), although some terms (such as forward curves) were set to defaults by the CPOâs
settings in the valuation model. Until the summer of 2016, these model valuations would at
month-end be updated and reconciled with the valuations provided by the CPOâs prime broker
for each of the various instruments. In June 2016, the CPO experienced several discrepancies
between its end-of-day marks (derived from its valuation model) and its month-end marks
(derived from counterparty statements). As a result, the CPO evaluated alternative methods for
valuing its swap and related positions, ultimately determining to use the valuation model to mark
the positions on both a daily and monthly basis. In fact, Respondentâs mismarking contributed to
the discrepancies noticed by the CPO.

Respondentâs mismarking was accomplished in several ways. Because the CPO used the
valuation model to mark its swap and other related instruments during the Relevant Period (first
for daily marks, and then at some point in the summer of 2016 for month-end marks as well), by
manipulating the settings of that model Respondent was able to create fictitious profits. First,
and most significantly, Respondent was able to assign different discount curves to swaps and
swaptions with identical or substantially similar terms depending on whether the CPO was
paying or receiving the fixed leg of the swap, or whether the CPO was long or short the
swaption. There was no economic justification for Respondentâs use of different discount curves.
for valuing similar instruments. The resulting mismatch in discount curves for otherwise
offsetting or nearly-offsetting positions created fictitious profits in the model used by the CPO to
value its swaps that did not reflect the actual value the swaps could realize if unwound. Second,
Respondent used incorrect day count settings for fixed and floating legs of some swaps and
swaptions in order to reduce the model value of future payments by the CPO or increase the
model value of future payments to the CPO, resulting in fictitious profits that would never
actually be realized by the CPO.

Respondent concealed his mismarking scheme in several ways. First, when the CPOâs
management sought to confirm the validity of using marks based on the valuation model,
Respondent asked his counterpart traders at swap dealers used by the CPO to provide him with
quotes to verify the model valuations. Respondent would typically do this through the chat
function of the Bloomberg terminal, and would provide either a screenshot or a copy of the chat
to the CPOâs back-office staff. However, Respondent would concealâeither by omitting
segments of the chat or by deleting relevant textâthat he had provided off-market forward rates
for the counterparty traders to use in calculating the quotes. Respondent knew that the
information he was omitting was material, and that by omitting it he created the false impression
that the broker quotes supported his fraudulent valuations.

A second technique used by Respondent to conceal his fraud was to structure the unwind
of certain trades in packages where he could instruct the counterparty to assign fees and
premiums to particular legs of the trade in such a way as to make it appear that certain positions
unwound at valuations close to those provided by the valuation model. For example, Respondent
mismarked one trade using different discount curves to create a net present value of
approximately $22.7 million. When instructed to unwind the trade at the end of March 2017,
Respondent negotiated with his counterparty to replace the tradeâcontrary to instructions not to
enter into new tradesâwith a new one that had a +68 basis point spread on it. This spread was
matched with a payment of $22.7 million to the CPO on the unwound tradeâan amount that
approximated the inflated value on the CPOâs books. In reality, however, this payment did not
result from profitable trading; instead, Respondent had built-in a loss on the new trade that offset
the fictitious profit on the unwound trade.

Respondent also engaged in other conduct intended to conceal his mismarking from the
CPO, including providing purported justifications to the CPOâs management and its auditor for
his use of differing discount curves for otherwise similar trades. Indeed, Respondent falsely told
the CPO that the use of differing discount curves for similar trades was an accepted practice that
led to more accurate valuations. Respondent also blamed user error (his own) for some of his
other alterations to default settings (like day counts).

Respondentâs mismarking created fictitious profits for fiscal year 2016 in the CPOâs
valuation model, which resulted in Respondent being paid an unjustified partial performance
bonus of $600,000 on December 31, 2016 (his remaining bonus payment was deferred until after
completion of the annual audit).

Ultimately, Respondent was confronted by the CPO regarding his mismarking after the
unwind trade discussed above failed to clear. Respondent was terminated by the CPO on April
25, 2017; as a result, the remainder of his unjustified performance bonus was never paid.

Ii. LEGAL DISCUSSION

Under Section 6(c)(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 9(1) (2012), it is unlawful for any person,
directly or indirectly, to use or employ in connection with, as relevant here, any swap, any
manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance, in violation of Regulation 180.1, 17 C.F.R.

Â§ 180.1 (2018). Regulation 180.1(a)(1)-(3), in relevant part, makes it unlawful for any person,
directly or indirectly, in connection with any swap, to intentionally or recklessly (1) use or
employ or attempt to use or employ any manipulative device, scheme, or artifice to defraud;

(2) make or attempt to make any untrue or misleading statement or omission of material fact; or
(3) engage or attempt to engage in any act or practice, which operates or would operate as a
fraud or deceit on any person.
Mismarking internal books to reflect fictitious profits or conceal losses constitutes
fraudulent conduct under the Act and Regulations, as does concealing such conduct through false
and misleading statements. See, e.g., Jn re Bourne, CFTC No. 18-51, 2018 WL 4862368 (Sept.
28, 2018) (consent order) (finding violations of Section 6(c)(1) and Regulation 180.1(a) where
respondent internally mismarked the valuation of inflation swap instruments to disguise
significant trading losses); CFTC v. Brooks, No. 13-C-6879(KMW), 2014 WL 4443446, at *4â5
(S.D.N.Y. Aug. 1, 2014) (consent order) (finding violations of Sections 4b and 6(c)(1) of the Act
and Regulation 180.1(a) when defendant mismarked internal books and records to inflate the
profitability of futures positions).

As set forth above, Respondent violated Section 6(c)(1) of the Act and Regulation
180.1(a)(1)-(3) because he intentionally or recklessly, in connection with certain interest rate
swaps and swaptions that he traded on behalf of the CPO: (1) used or employed a manipulative
device, scheme, or artifice to defraud; (2) made untrue or misleading statements of material fact
or omitted to state material facts necessary in order to make the statements made not untrue or
misleading; and (3) engaged in acts, practices, or courses of business which operated as a fraud
or deceit on the CPO. By this conduct, Respondent violated Section 6(c)(1) of the Act and
Regulation 180.1(a)(1)-(3).

IV. FINDINGS OF VIOLATIONS
