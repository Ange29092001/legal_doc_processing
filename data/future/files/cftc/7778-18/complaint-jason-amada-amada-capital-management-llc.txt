V.

JASON AMADA and AMADA CAPITAL
MANAGEMENT LLC,

Defendants.

 

 

COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,
CIVIL MONETARY PENALTIES, AND OTHER RELIEF

Plaintiff, Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ) alleges as follows:
I. SUMMARY

1. In February 2014, the Commissionâs Division of Enforcement sent Defendant
Jason Amada (âAmadaâ) a letter notifying him that he was required to be registered with the
Commission as a commodity trading advisor (âCTAâ) because he was soliciting clients for
individually managed forex accounts through a website. Rather than register as required by the
Commodity Exchange Act (âActâ) and Commission Regulations (âRegulationsâ), Amada shut
down his website. The cessation of his illegal solicitation of clients, however, was short-lived.
Amada never intended to cease his conduct that the Commission informed him would require
registration.

2. From at least February 2014 through at least November 2015 (the âRelevant
Periodâ), Defendants Amada Capital Management (âACMâ), an unregistered CTA, and Amada,

an unregistered associated person (âAPâ) of ACM, (collectively, âDefendantsâ), fraudulently
solicited at least one client to open an individually managed trading account for off-exchange
foreign currency contracts (âforexâ) and caused approximately $280,000 in losses in less than
two months of trading.

3. On or before June 22, 2015, Defendants established a new website,
www.amadacapitalfx.com (âWebsiteâ). The Website was nearly identical in content to the
website Amada operated prior to receiving notice in February 2014 of the registration
requirements associated with soliciting clients for individually managed forex accounts through a
website.

4. Through the Website, ACM held itself out generally to the public as a CTA and
solicited potential clients to open individually managed forex trading accounts. The Website
claimed that ACM âonly accept[s] Non-US clientsâ; however, this was false. Defendants
solicited at least one client in the United States (âClient Aâ) and directed Client A to visit the
Website for information about ACMâs managed account services.

5. Defendants persuaded Client A to open a forex account and also obtained written
authorization to manage Client Aâs forex account.

6. Defendants made fraudulent misrepresentations to Client A about how
Defendants would manage Client Aâs account. Client A deposited approximately $280,000 to a
forex account for Defendants to manage. Defendants misrepresented that they would limit Client
Aâs losses to 1% of the account value through the implementation of a hedging strategy. Rather
than implement a hedging strategy, Defendants traded speculatively and aggressivelyâlosing
approximately 92% of Client Aâs account value in the first nine days of trading. During
Defendantsâ mismanagement of Client Aâs account, Defendants attempted to mask the losses

through additional misrepresentations and omissions to Client A.
7. In less than two months of managing the forex trading for Client A, Defendants
caused approximately $280,000 in trading lossesâwith Client A withdrawing the remaining
approximately $1,000 balance and closing the account.

8. Client A was neither an eligible contract participant (âECPâ), nor an eligible
commercial entity (âECEâ).

9, During the Relevant Period, ACM failed to register as a CTA and Amada failed to
register as an AP of aCTA.

10. By virtue of this conduct and the conduct further described herein, Defendants,
either directly or as controlling persons, have engaged, are engaging, or are about to engage in
acts and practices in violation of Sections 2(c)(2)(C)ai)(1)(bb), 4b(a)(2), 4k(3), 4m(1), and 40(1)
of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 2(c)(2)(C)a)(D(bb), 6b(a)(2), 6k(3), 6m(1), 60(1) (2012), and
Regulations 5.2(b)(1) and (3), and 5.3(a)(3), 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 5.2(b)(1), (3), 5.3(a)(3) (2018).

11. During the Relevant Period, Defendant Amada was an officer, employee, or agent
of ACM. Therefore, ACM is liable for the acts and omissions of Amada done in the scope of his
employment or office, pursuant to Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(a)(1)(B) (2012),
and Regulation 1.2, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.2 (2018).

12. Defendant Amada was a controlling person of ACM throughout the Relevant
Period and did not act in good faith or knowingly induced ACMâs violations of the Act and
Regulations described herein. Therefore, Amada is liable for ACMâs violations of the Act and
Regulations, pursuant to Section 13(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13c(b) (2012).

13. Accordingly, pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2012), the
Commission brings this action to enjoin Defendantsâ unlawful acts and practices, to compel their

compliance with the Act and the Regulations promulgated thereunder, and to enjoin them from
Case 1:18-cv-07895 Documenti1 Filed 08/29/18 Page 4 of 22

engaging in any commodity related activity. In addition, the Commission seeks civil monetary
penalties and remedial ancillary relief, including, but not limited to, trading and registration bans,
restitution, disgorgement, rescission, pre- and post-judgment interest, and such other and further
relief as the Court may deem necessary and appropriate.
II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

14. â This Court has jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1331 (2012)
(federal question jurisdiction) and 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1345 (2012), which provides that district courts
have original jurisdiction over civil actions commenced by the United States or by any agency
expressly authorized to sue by Act of Congress. Section 6c(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(a)
(2012), authorizes the Commission to seek injunctive relief in any proper district court of the
United States against any person whenever it shall appear to the Commission that such person
has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a violation of
any provision of the Act or any rule, regulation or order thereunder.

15. Venue properly lies with this Court pursuant to 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(e), because the
acts and practices in violation of the Act and Regulations have occurred within this District.

commodity for future delivery (or an option thereon) that is executed, traded on or otherwise
subject to the rules of a contract market designated pursuant to Section 5(a) of the Act,

(3) [w]illfully to deceive or attempt to deceive any person by any means whatsoever.â

24. 7US.C. Â§ la(l2)(A)G)dI) defines a CTA, in pertinent part, as any person who
âfor compensation or profit, engages in the business of advising others, either directly or through
publications, writings, or electronic media, as to the value of or the advisability of trading inâ
(I) any agreement, contract, or transaction described in [S]ection 2(c)(2)(C)() or

Vv. FACTS
A. Defendants Fraudulently Solicited a Client for a Managed Forex Account.

34. Defendants fraudulently solicited at least one client to open a managed forex
account by misrepresenting Client Aâs risk of loss associated with forex trading. Specifically,
Defendants made false statements to Client A that they would implement a hedging strategy to
protect Client Aâs funds from loss, that Defendants had significant and profitable experience
trading forex for clients, and that Client Aâs account would be opened through a registered retail
foreign exchange dealer (âRFEDâ). A registered RFED could legally enter into retail forex
transactions with U.S. customers under the Act and Regulations.

35. Defendants did not disclose to Client A that Defendants would ultimately receive
commissions for trades placed in Client Aâs account, whether or not the trades were profitable.

Defendants then used some of the commissions generated through trading Client Aâs account to
reimburse Client Aâs account in an attempt to cover up the mounting lossesâall without
informing Client A of the losses or re1mbursements.
1. Defendants Made Misrepresentations Concerning the Risk of Loss Associated

with Forex Trading and Defendantsâ Profitable Trading History and
Qualifications.

36. In May 2015, Amada met Client A through a social networking website. During
their initial interactions, Amada stated that he was a licensed, professional currency trader.
Client A was physically present in New York City. Amada and Client A met in person on at
least one occasion and also communicated via email, text, and telephone on other occasions.

37. On or around July 30, 2015, because of Amadaâs representations that he was a
professional currency trader, Client A sought advice from Amada concerning money she needed
to convert from Euros to U.S. Dollars for the purchase of real estate in New York City.

38. Client A told Amada that she had a low risk tolerance for the conversion of the
funds because the money would be needed to pay for a property Client A was under contract to
purchaseâwith a closing date in or around January 2016. Client A informed Amada that losing
more than 1% of the money would jeopardize the property transaction and potentially result in
the loss of the down payment.

39. Amada stated that he had another client âin a similar situationâ and suggested that
Client A open an account with a RFED to implement a hedging strategy and avoid âtransfer
feesâ that would otherwise be charged by a bank to convert the money from Euros to U.S.
Dollars. Amada also sent a link directing Client A to ACMâs Website, which provided
additional information concerning ACMâs offering of managed forex accounts for clients,
including claims that ACM had achieved year-to-date client profits of 99%. Through these
initial discussions, and later communications, Amada solicited Client A to open a retail forex

account in which Defendants would exercise discretionary trading authority.

9
40. | Amadaâs representations were false.

Al. First, Amada was not âlicensed.â He has never been registered with the
Commission even though Amada knew that the broad solicitation of the public, through the
Website, for managed forex accounts, required registration. Second, Amada did not manage any
accountsâwhether owned by him or by ACM clientsâthat experienced profitable trading
results, let alone anywhere near the 99% claimed on the Website. Third, Amada never intended
to execute a hedging strategy on behalf of Client A. The trading he executed in Client Aâs
account was inconsistent with any purported hedging strategy; in fact, the trading was so
speculative in nature that Defendantsâ trading lost approximately 92% of Client Aâs funds after
only nine days of trading.

42. Also, despite knowing that Client A was a U.S. citizen, he directed Client A to
use her foreign-issued passport to open a managed forex account at a foreign, unregistered
RFEDâfalsely representing that it was merely a division of a U.S. entity that was for clients
âthat have Euro based funds.â He also told Client A that the foreign RFED had âtighter spreadsâ
for the traders that would allow him to better implement his âhedgingâ strategy.

43. Amada directed Client A to open her account with the foreign RFED because its
registered, U.S.-based affiliate would not permit Amada to generate and receive commissions as
an introducing broker without being registered with the Commission. Also, the foreign RFED
permitted greater leverage for trading than the registered U.S.-based affiliate, which
consequently permitted riskier trading to occur in that account.

44. Amada also failed to disclose that the foreign RFED at which Client A opened her
account was not registered with the Commission, and was therefore not permitted to serve as the

counterparty for retail forex transactions with U.S. customers.

10
45. On September 6, 2015, relying on Amadaâs misrepresentations, Client A entered

into a Money Management Agreement (âMMAâ) with Defendants. Among other things, the
MMA stated that Amada would have discretionary authority to execute forex transactions on
Client Aâs behalf. The agreement also recited Client Aâs maximum loss target of 1% and that
Amada âwill adjust the position size and risk management accordingly to stay within these
guidelines.â The MMA, however, was never provided to the foreign RFED.

46. On September 6, 2015, Client A also signed a Managed Account Authorization,
Limited Power of Attorney (âPOAâ) with the foreign RFED. By its terms, the POA authorized a
money manager, namely, Amadaâs father, to place trades in Client Aâs account. Even though the
POA nominally authorized Amadaâs father to trade Client Aâs account, Amada actually directed
the trading. The POA also indicated that the money manager would receive, as compensation,
20% of profits from the managed account.

47. Amada was not identified on the POA filed with the RFED. When Client A
questioned Amada about his father being listed on the POA, Amada told her that it was a family
business, that it was just a formality, and that Amada would be the one conducting all the trading
in the account. Client A did not have any interaction with Amadaâs father until after she closed
the trading account in November 2015.

48. | Amadaâs name, however, did not appear on official documents filed with the
foreign RFED because Amada was taking steps to hide, on paper, his involvement in Client Aâs
account because the RFED had rejected Amadaâs previous applications to become a money
manager.

49. Nonetheless, Amada directed all account activity through communications with at

least one of the RFEDâs employees.

11
Case 1:18-cv-07895 Document1 Filed 08/29/18 Page 12 of 22

2. Defendants Did Not Disclose That They Would Receive Commissions from the
Trading in Client Aâs Account, Regardless of Profitability.

50. On August 19, 2015, Amadaâs mother entered into an Introducing Broker
Agreement with the same foreign RFED. By the terms of this agreement, the foreign RFED
established a control account (âControl Accountâ) in the name of Amadaâs mother for the
purpose of earning commissions based on the trading activity of customers she introduced to the
foreign RFED.

51. The foreign RFED treated Client Aâs account as an account introduced by
Amadaâs mother. The foreign RFED paid commissions to the Control Account based on forex
trading in Client Aâs account that was executed by Amada using his fatherâs Money Manager
Account. Client Aâs account was the only account associated with the Control Account.

52. | Amada directed and performed all actions related to the formation of the Control
Account and its transfer of funds through communications with at least one of the RFEDâs
employees.

53. Amada did not disclose to Client A the existence of the Control Account or that
the Control Account would receive commissions for trades placed in Client Aâs account, whether
or not the trading was profitable.

3. Defendants Engaged in Speculative Trading and Covered Up the Losses by
Hiding Reimbursements Sent from the Control Account.

54. On September 15, 2015, Client A funded the account with a deposit of
â¬249,121.99 ($280,000).' Amada began trading forex in Client Aâs account the same day.
Rather than execute a hedging strategy for Client Aâs Euro-based funds, as Amada claimed he

would, he began speculating on the movement of forex currencies by trading both the U.S.

 

' AIL U.S. Dollar values are approximated based on exchange rates in place at the time of the conduct.

12
Dollar and the Euro currencies against multiple foreign currencies, including the Japanese Yen,
New Zealand Dollar, Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar, and Swiss Franc.

55. Between September 15, 2015 and September 23, 2015, Client Aâs account
suffered approximately â¬230,000 ($258,000) in lossesâapproximately 92% of the accountâs
value. Over this same period, the Control Account received approximately â¬95,000 ($106,000)
in fees from trading Client Aâs account.

56. To cover up his enormous trading losses, on September 21, 2015, Amada
requested that the RFED return â¬50,000 ($56,000) to Client A from the Control Account. On
September 23, 2015, the RFED completed the transfer from the Control Account to Client A.
Between, September 23, 2015 and September 30, 2015, Amada lost an additional â¬62,889
($70,000)âthe remaining funds from Client Aâs initial deposit, plus most of the â¬50,000
($56,000) transferred from the Control Account. In just the first two weeks of tradingâbetween
September 15, 2015, and September 30, 2015âthe Control Account received â¬136,158.89
($153,000) in commissions from Amadaâs trading of Client Aâs accountâbased on an initial
deposit of about â¬250,000 ($280,000).

57. Over the remaining time the account stayed open, Amada made an additional five
requests for the RFED to refund fees from the Control Account to Client A to hide the significant
losses in the account. Amada directed the RFED to make the following transfers from the
Control Account to Client A:

i. October 1, 2015 â â¬30,000 ($34,000);
ii. October 6, 2015 â â¬25,000 ($28,000);
iii. October 9, 2015 â â¬15,000 ($17,000);

iv. October 19, 2015 â â¬6,500 ($7,300); and

13
v. October 27, 2015 â â¬3,000 ($3,300).

58. Amada did not inform Client A that money was being transferred to Client Aâs
account to cover losses sustained through trading. Further, Amada sought confirmation from the
RFED that Client A would not receive notification of the transfers, other than the deposit
appearing as an entry on Client Aâs monthly statement.

59. On October 5, 2015, Amada transferred â¬30,000 ($34,000) from the Control
Account to his motherâs bank account. Most of the funds ultimately made their way to Amadaâs
personal bank account.

60. On November 4, 2015, after discovering Amadaâs conduct, Client A withdrew the
remaining balance of â¬899.79 ($1,000) and closed the trading account.

6l. In total, Defendants generated and received approximately â¬162,000 ($180,000)
in commissions through the Control Account, most of which was redeposited to Client Aâs
trading account and lost in trading.

B. Defendants Failed To Register with the Commission.

62. Defendants operated the Website, which held ACM out generally to the public as
a commodity trading advisor. The Website solicited clients to open trading accounts that would
be managed by Defendants.

63. Amada provided Client A with the address for the Website via text message on
August 3, 2015, as part of his solicitation of Client A to open an individually managed forex
trading account.

64. During the Relevant Period, Defendants ACM and Amada acted as a CTA, and its
AP, respectively, by exercising discretionary trading authority or obtaining written authorization
to exercise discretionary trading authority over an account in connection with retail forex

transactions. In addition, Defendants ACM and Amada acted as a CTA and its AP, respectively,

14
Case 1:18-cv-07895 Document1 Filed 08/29/18 Page 15 of 22

by providing retail forex trading advice for compensation or profit, and used emails, text
messages, the Internet, or other means or instrumentality of interstate commerce to solicit clients
for management of retail forex accounts.

65. During the Relevant Period, Defendant ACM was not registered with the
Commission as a CTA nor was it exempt or excluded from registration as a CTA.

66. During the Relevant Period, Defendant Amada acted as an AP of ACM by
soliciting clientsâ or prospective clientsâ discretionary trading accounts.

67. During the Relevant Period, Amada was not registered with the Commission as an
AP of a CTA nor was he exempt or excluded from registration.
