ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTION 6(c) AND (d) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, MAKING
FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

I. INTRODUCTION

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ) has reason to believe that
from in or about January 2013 through January 2016 (âRelevant Periodâ), FNY Partners Fund
LP (âRespondentâ or âFNY Fundââ) violated Section 4c(a)(5)(C) of the Commodity Exchange
Act (âActâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§6c(a)(5)(C) (2018). Therefore, the Commission deems it appropriate and
in the public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted to
determine whether FNY Fund engaged in the violations set forth herein and to determine
whether any order should be issued imposing remedial sanctions.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Respondent has
submitted an Offer of Settlement (âOfferâ), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Without admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, Respondent consents to
the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Section 6(c) and (d) of the
Commodity Exchange Act, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (âOrderââ) and
acknowledges service of this Order.â

 

âRespondent consents to the use of the findings of fact and conclusions of law in this Order in this proceeding and
in any other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party or claimant, and agrees
that they shall be taken as true and correct and be given preclusive effect therein, without further proof. Respondent
does not consent, however, to the use of this Order, or the findings or conclusions herein, as the sole basis for any
other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party or claimant, other than: a
proceeding in bankruptcy or receivership; or a proceeding to enforce the terms of this Order. Respondent does not
consent to the use of the Offer or this Order, or the findings or conclusions in this Order, by any other party in any
other proceeding.
II. FINDINGS
The Commission finds the following:
A. SUMMARY

During the Relevant Period, Respondent, by and through one of its former traders,
Trader A, engaged in multiple instances of the disruptive trading practice known as âspoofingâ
(1.e., bidding or offering with the intent to cancel the bid or offer before execution) involving
futures contracts including, among other contracts, soybean futures contracts, gold futures
contracts, and crude oil futures contracts, traded on Chicago Board of Trade (âCBOTââ),
Commodity Exchange (âCOMEXââ), and New York Mercantile Exchange (âNYMEXâ),
respectively, designated contract markets that are owned and operated by CME Group Inc. This
conduct violated Section 4c(a)(5)(C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6c(a)(5)(C) (2018).

In accepting Respondentâs Offer, the Commission recognizes Respondentâs cooperation
with the Division of Enforcementâs investigation of this matter and Respondentâs remediation.

B. RESPONDENT

FNY Partners Fund LP is a limited partnership organized in Delaware and
headquartered in New York City. It is not registered in any capacity with the Commission.

C. FACTS
1. Spoofing

During the Relevant Period, Respondent employed Trader A. Trader Aâs
responsibilities during the Relevant Period included trading futures contracts, such as soybean
futures contracts, gold futures contracts, and crude oil futures, among other futures contracts.

During the Relevant Period, Trader A began placing bids and offers in Respondentâs
trading account for, among other things, CBOT soybean, COMEX gold, and NYMEX crude oil
futures contracts with the intent to cancel those bids and offers before their execution. Trader
Aâs trading pattern generally involved the placement of an order that he wanted to get filled
(âGenuine Orderâ), on one side of the market, typically consisting of a passive order for ten or
fewer contracts; and on the opposite side of the market, placement of one or more orders that he
intended to cancel before execution (âSpoof Orderâ), typically consisting of one or more passive
orders for, collectively, five times as many contracts as the Genuine Order. Generally, Trader A
quickly canceled the Spoof Order after placing it, and often after his Genuine Order was filled.

During the Relevant Period, Trader A placed multiple Spoof Orders for, among
other contracts, CBOT soybean, COMEX gold, and NYMEX crude oil futures contracts.

2. Remediation

Respondent represents that upon notification by the Division of Enforcement of this
investigation, it promptly undertook proactive remedial measures and other steps to improve its
compliance processes. Among other things, Respondent represents that it has improved its
trader training program to include greater focus on spoofing and is implementing an automated

2
trade surveillance system for Respondentâs futures trading, which includes surveillance for
spoofing.

Ht, LEGAL DISCUSSION

A. Spoofing in Violation of Section 4c(a)(5)(C) of the Act

Section 4c(a)(5)(C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6c(a)(5)(C) (2018), makes it unlawful for
âââ[a]ny person to engage in any trading, practice, or conduct on or subject to the rules of a
registered entity that . . . is, is of the character of, or is commonly known to the trade as,
âspoofingâ (bidding or offering with the intent to cancel the bid or offer before execution).â See,
e.g., United States v. Coscia, 866 F.3d 782, 792-93 (7th Cir. 2017) (holding that because the Act
clearly defines spoofing, it provides adequate notice of prohibited conduct), cert. denied, 138 S.
Ct. 1989 (2018).

As described above, during the Relevant Period, Respondent, by and through the acts of
Trader A, placed bids and offers for futures contracts listed on CBOT, COMEX, and NYMEX,
all registered entities, with the intent to cancel those bids and offers before they were executed.
By engaging in this conduct, Trader A violated Section 4c(a)(5)(C) of the Act. See CFTC v.
Oystacher, 203 F. Supp. 3d 934, 942 (N.D. Ill. 2016) (denying motion for judgment on the
pleadings, holding that allegations of placing âboth bids and offers with the intent to cancel
those bids or offers before executionâ constitutes âtrading behavior [that] falls within the
Spoofing Statuteâs defined prohibitionâ).

B. Respondent is Liable for the Acts of its Agents

Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(a)(1)(B) (2018), and Commission Regulation
(âRegulationâ) 1.2, 17 C.F.R. $1.2 (2019), provide that â[t]he act, omission, or failure of any
official, agent, or other person acting for any individual, association, partnership, corporation, or
trust within the scope of his employment or office shall be deemed the act, omission, or failure of
such individual, association, partnership, corporation, or trust.ââ Pursuant to section 2(a)(1)(B) of
the Act and Regulation 1.2, strict liability is imposed on principals for the actions of their agents.
See, e.g., Rosenthal & Co. v. CFTC, 802 F.2d 963 966 (7th Cir. 1986); CFTC v. Byrnes, 58 F.
Supp. 3d 319, 324 (S.D.N.Y. 2014).

Because Trader A engaged in the spoofing conduct described above within the scope of
his employment with Respondent, Respondent is liable for Trader Aâs violation of Section

A4c(a)(5)(C) of the Act.

IV. FINDINGS OF VIOLATION

Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that, during the Relevant Period,
Respondent violated Section 4c(a)(5)(C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6c(a)(5)(C) (2018).
