Bt EX PARTE STATUTORY RESTRAINING ORDER
AND ASSET FREEZE

 

Plaintiff, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ or âCFTCâ),
has filed a Complaint for Injunctive and Other Equitable Relief and Civil Monetary Penalties
under the Commodity Exchange Act and moved, pursuant to Section 6c(a) of the Commodity
Exchange Acct (the âActâ), for an ex parte statutory restraining order freezing assets, and
prohibiting the destruction of books, records, or other documents. This Court has considered the
pleadings, declarations, exhibits, and memorandum filed in support of the Commissionâs Motion
for Ex Parte Statutory Restraining Order (âSROâ) and finds that:

1. This Court has jurisdiction over the parties and over the subject matter of this
action pursuant to Sections 2(c)(2) and 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 2(c)(2) and 13a-1 (2012)
which authorizes the Commission to seek injunctive relief against any person whenever it shall
appear that such person has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in any act or practice

constituting a violation of any provision of the Act or any rule, regulation or order thereunder.

2. Venue lies properly within this District pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act, 7
U.S.C. Â§13a-1(e) (2012), in that the Defendants are found, inhabit, or transact business in this
District, or the acts and practices in violation of the Act have occurred, are occurring or are about
to occur within this District.

3. There is good cause to believe that Defendants have engaged in, are engaging in,
or are about to engage in violations of 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6c(a) (2012) and 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.38(a) (2014).
Weighing the equities and considering the Commissionâs likelihood of success in its claims for
relief, the issuance of an SRO is in the public interest.

4. There is good cause for the Court to freeze certain assets owned, controlled,
managed, or held by or on behalf of, or for the benefit of Defendants. Absent the entry of this
statutory restraining order, Defendants are likely to dissipate or transfer assets and destroy
business records.

5. There is good cause for entry of an order prohibiting Defendants, their agents,
servants, employees, assigns, attorneys, and persons in active concert or participation with
Defendants, including any successor thereof, from destroying records and/or denying agents of
the Commission access to inspect and copy records to ensure that Commission representatives
have immediate and complete access to those books and records.

6. There is good cause to believe that immediate and irreparable damage to the
Courtâs ability to grant effective final relief in the form of monetary redress will occur from the
sale, transfer, assignment, or other disposition by Defendants of assets or records unless
Defendants are immediately restrained and enjoined by Order of the Court.

7. This is a proper case for granting an ex parfe statutory restraining order to

preserve the status quo and enable the Commission to fulfill its statutory duties.
