ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTION 6(c) AND (d) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, MAKING
FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

I. INTRODUCTION

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ) has reason to believe that
Catalyst Capital Advisors, LLC (âCatalystâ) and Jerry Szilagyi (âSzilagyiâ) violated Section
40(1)(B) of the Commodity Exchange Act (âActâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 60(1)(B) (2012), and Regulation
166.3, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 166.3 (2019), of the Commission Regulations (âRegulationsâ) promulgated
thereunder. Therefore, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest that
public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted to determine whether
Respondents engaged in the violations set forth herein and to determine whether any order
should be issued imposing remedial sanctions.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Respondents have
submitted an Offer of Settlement (âOfferâ), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Without admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, Respondents consent to
the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Section 6(c) and (d) of the Commodity
Exchange Act, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (âOrderâ), and
acknowledges service of this Order.â

 

' Respondents consent to the use of the findings of fact and conclusions of law in this Order in this proceeding and
in any other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party or claimant, and agree
that they shall be taken as true and correct and be given preclusive effect therein, without further proof.

Respondents do not consent, however, to the use of this Order, or the findings or conclusions herein, as the sole
basis for any other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party or claimant, other
than: a proceeding in bankruptcy or receivership; or a proceeding to enforce the terms of this Order. Respondents
do not consent to the use of the Offer or this Order, or the findings or conclusions in this Order, by any other party in
any other proceeding.
II. FINDINGS
The Commission finds the following:
A. SUMMARY

Respondent Catalyst Capital Advisors, LLC (âCatalystâ) operates a family of mutual
funds, including the Catalyst Hedged Futures Strategy Fund (the âFundââ). The Fund traded on-
exchange options on S&P Futures Contracts. Since at least 2014, the Fundâs strategy relied
heavily on taking net short call options positions. From September 2013 to November 2016, the
Fund grew from $6 million in assets under management to over $4 billion in assets under
management.â By 2016, the Fund was, by far, Catalystâs largest.

Szilagyi has been the CEO and majority owner of Catalyst since he co-founded the
company in 2006.

Catalyst and its agents made representations regarding risk management that were
materially misleading. Specifically, Catalyst represented that strict risk management protocols
were in place, including stop-loss measures to limit losses. Moreover, the Fundâs portfolio
manager told investors or investment advisors that he took specific steps to stress-test the
portfolio and to limit losses to 8% of assets under management. Catalyst also told investment
advisors that risk metrics were reviewed by a dedicated risk manager on a daily basis. These
statements were false or misleading. No stop-loss measures were in place. Due to large net
short options positions throughout 2016, the Fund was frequently at risk of losing well over 8%
of its value on a relatively modest increase in the underlying market.

Catalystâs misstatements and those of its agents, including through the portfolio manager,
violated Section 40(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 60(1)(B) (2012). Further, Catalyst failed to
implement a supervisory system designed to ensure that statements made in its marketing
materials and by its agents about risk management were consistent with how the Fundâs risk was
actually managed. This failure violated Regulation 166.3, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 166.3 (2019). Asa
control person of Catalyst who failed to establish an adequate system of supervision, Szilagyi is
liable for Catalystâs violations of Section 40(1)(B) and Regulation 166.3.

B. RESPONDENTS

Since 2013, Catalyst has been registered with the Commission as a Commodity Pool
Operator (âCPOâ).

Respondent Jerry Szilagyi is the CEO of Catalyst Capital Advisors, LLC, and its majority
owner. Szilagyi has been a listed Principal of Catalyst since the companyâs registration as a
CPO in 2013.

 

* Catalyst charged an advisory fee that was equal to a percentage of the Fundâs assets under management.
C. FACTS

From November 2014 through February 2017, Catalyst and its agents made
representations about how the Fund managed risk that were not consistent with how the Fundâs
risk was actually managed. Such representations were made in writing, including in Fund
marketing materials, and orally by the Fundâs portfolio manager. For example, the Fundâs
written marketing presentations stated that the Fund had âportfolio level stop loss trigger points
to limit drawdownsâ or âaggregate portfolio stop loss measures.â Catalystâs marketing materials
also stated that the Fundâs risk metrics were monitored or overseen by a dedicated risk manager.
On at least two occasions, investment advisors were told that such monitoring occurred on a
daily basis.

On âopen houseâ conference calls with investment advisors (who had discretion over
client portfolios), the Fundâs portfolio manager stated that he used sophisticated options
modeling software to stress test the portfolio, and that when the stress tests showed him that the
portfolio was at risk of losing more than 8% of the Fundâs net asset value, he hedged to remove
that risk before it could materialize. For example, on November 4, 2014, the portfolio manager
stated:

I use risk management to control losses to roughly 8%;
thatâs the number I use in stress testing . . . I have very
sophisticated options pricing models. I plug the portfolio
into these models each day. I stress the portfolio for a
series of [underlying] price movements up to 10%. I stress
the portfolio for volatility movements . . . and then I look
over five different time frames .... Ill vary those time
frames to match up to different times that are important to
optionsâexpirations for part of the portfolio, for example.
Sol... identify whatâs the impact on the portfolio value at
these stress points, and if the impact is greater than my 8%
limit, then Pll go in and I'll hedge the portfolio to bring it
back in line.

(Emphasis added.)

On other occasions in 2015 and 2016, the portfolio manager made similar statements,
emphasizing that he stress tested the portfolio against 5% and 10% increases in the underlying
market, and that when these tests showed him that the Fund was at risk of losing more than 8%,
he traded until that risk went away. He told investment advisors that âweâre never in a situation
where ... weâre sitting waiting for that 8% to get triggered.â

These representations were false or misleading. The Fundâs risk management protocols
did not include âaggregate portfolio stop loss measures.â Moreover, the portfolio manager on
various occasions did not, in fact, take the risk-limiting steps that he told investment advisors he
did, and would, take. Rather, for extended periods from 2014 to 2017, the Fund was at risk of
double digit losses if the underlying S&P 500 were to increase just a few percentage points. For
example, on February |, 2017, the portfolio managerâs software would have indicated that a 5%
increase in the S&P Futures market would result in significant, double-digit losses to the Fund.
Yet, contrary to what investors had been told, the Fund did not enter any trades from February |
through February 8, 2017, to mitigate that risk. From February 9 through March 1, 2017, the
market rose roughly 4.4% and the Fund lost over 19% of its value.

Moreover, Catalystâs risk manager did not review the Fundâs risk metrics on a daily
basis.

Catalyst failed to take adequate steps to deter the making of the foregoing misstatements
regarding the Fundâs risk management or to ensure that the Fund was managed in such a way as
to make them accurate. Specifically, Catalyst did not implement or maintain procedures
designed to ensure that âstop-lossâ measures and other risk-limiting tools described to investors
or investment advisors were actually utilized. Neither the risk manager, nor anyone else at
Catalyst, took proactive steps to override the portfolio manager to limit the Fundâs loss exposure
until it was too late. Nor did Catalyst implement or maintain adequate procedures designed to
ensure that those acting on its behalf did not make misrepresentations to investors or investment
advisors, or to correct misrepresentations that were made.

As the CEO of Catalyst at all relevant times, Szilagyi directly or indirectly controlled all
aspects of Catalystâs business, including the Fund. He had the power and authority to establish
and implement a supervisory system designed to detect and prevent the violations described
above.

Hl. LEGAL DISCUSSION
A. Catalystâs Misstatements Operated as a Fraud
Section 40(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§60(1)(B) (2012), states:

It shall be unlawful for a... commodity pool operator, or
associated person of a commodity pool operator by use of

. any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce,
directly or indirectly . . . (B) to engage in any transaction,
practice, or course of business which operates as a fraud or
deceit upon any client or participant or prospective client or
participant.

To prevail on a Section 40(1)(B) claim, the Commission must prove the CPO or
associated person thereof made a misrepresentation or omission that was material. CFTC v.
Heffernan, 245 F. Supp. 2d 1276, 1292 (S.D. Ga. 2003). The focus of Section 40(1)(B) is on
whether the respondentâs conduct âhad the effect of a fraud upon a customer or potential
customer.â /d. at 1290. The Commission need not prove that the respondent acted with scienter.
Messer v. E.F. Hutton & Co., 847 F.2d 673, 677 (11th Cir. 1988); Heffernan, 245 F. Supp. 2d at
1292; see also CFTC v. Savage, 611 F.2d 270, 285 (9th Cir. 1980) (âIf the [CPO] intended to do
what was done and its consequence is to defraud the client or prospective client that is enough to
constitute a violation of section 40 1)â).
ââA representation or omission is âmaterialâ if a reasonable investor would consider it
important in deciding whether to make an investment.â CFTC v. Kratville, 796 F.3d 873, 895
(8th Cir. 2015) (quoting CFTC v. R.J. Fitzgerald, 310 F.3d 1321, 1328-29 (11th Cir. 2002)
(citations omitted)). Importantly, âmisrepresentations concerning profit and risk go to the heart
of a customerâs investment decision and are therefore material as a matter of law.â CFTC v.
Noble Wealth Data Info. Servs., Inc., 90 F. Supp. 2d 676, 686 (D. Md. 2000), aff'd in part and
vacated in part on other grounds, 278 F.3d 319 (4th Cir. 2002).

Catalyst violated Section 40(1)(B) of the Act because it made the false or misleading
statements described above regarding strict risk management protocols, stop-loss measures, and
the role of the risk manager. Because these statements concerned the risk of investing in the
Fund, they were inherently material. Catalyst is also liable for the misstatements of the portfolio
manager, as he was speaking within the scope of his position or office with Catalyst. See Section
2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(a)(1)(B) (2012); Regulation 1.2, 17 C_F.R. Â§ 1.2 (2018).

B. Catalyst Failed To Supervise

Regulation 166.3, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 166.3 (2019), imposes on every Commission registrant
(except associated persons who have no supervisory duties) an affirmative duty to âdiligently
supervise the handling by its partners, officers, employees and agents . . . of all commodity
interest accounts carried, operated, advised or introduced by the registrant and all other activities
of its partners, officers, employees and agents . . . relating to its business as a Commission
Registrant.â In order to prove a violation of Regulation 166.3, the Commission must
demonstrate that either: (1) the registrantâs supervisory system was generally inadequate; or
(2) the registrant failed to perform its supervisory duties diligently. In re GNP Commodities,
Inc., CFTC No. 89-1, 1992 WL 201158, at *19 (Aug. 11, 1992), aff'd sub nom. Monieson v.
CFTC, 996 F 2d. 852 (7th Cir. 1993). A violation under Regulation 166.3 is an independent
violation for which no underlying violation is necessary. See, e.g., In re Collins, CFTC No. 94-
13, 1997 WL 761927, at*10 (Dec. 10, 1997) (âIt is well settled that a violation under Rule 166.3
is âan independent and primary violation for which no underlying violation is necessary.ââ
(citation omitted)); GNP Commodities, 1992 WL 201158, at *17 n.11 (âRule 166.3 establishes
failure to supervise as an independent and primary violation ... .â (citation omitted)).

âTA] showing that the registrant lacks an adequate supervisory system can be sufficient to
establish a breach of duty under Rule 166.3.â Collins, 1997 WL 761927, at *10 (citing In re
First Natâl Trading Corp., CFTC Nos. 90-28, 92-17, 1994 WL 378010, at *10 July 20, 1994),
affâd without op. sub nom. Pick v. CFTC, 99 F.3d 1139 (6th Cir. Oct. 21, 1996)). The lack of an
adequate supervisory system can be established by showing that the registrant failed to develop
proper procedures for the detection of wrongdoing. CFTC vy. Trinity Fin. Grp, Inc., No. 92-cv-
6832, 1997 WL 820970, at *29 (S.D. Fla. Sept. 29, 1997) (controlling person failed to establish
or maintain meaningful procedures for detecting fraud by firmâs employees and controlling
person knew of specific incidents of misconduct, yet failed to take reasonable steps to correct the
problems), aff'd in part, vacated in part, and remanded sub nom. CFTC v. Sidoti, 178 F.3d 1132,
1137 (11th Cir. 1999),
Evidence of violations that âshould be detected by a diligent system of supervision, either
because of the nature of the violations or because the violations have occurred repeatedly,â is
probative of a failure to supervise. Paragon Futures, CFTC No. 88-18, 1992 WL 74261, at *14.
The duty to supervise âexpands a registrantâs focus beyond the consequences of its agentsâ
wrongful acts to include the broader goals of detection and deterrence of possible wrongdoing by
a [registrantâs] agents.â Lobb v. J.T. McKerr & Co., CFTC No. 85R-185, 1989 WL 242384, at
*11 (Dec. 14, 1989). Accordingly, under Regulation 166.3, registrants have a âduty to develop
procedures for âthe detection and deterrence of possible wrongdoing by its agents.ââ Sansom
Refining Co. v. Drexel Burnham Lambert, Inc., CFTC No. 82-R448, 1990 WL 282783, at *11
(Feb. 16, 1990) (quoting Lobb v. J.T. McKerr & Co., 1989 WL 242384, at *11).

Because Catalyst did not have an adequate supervisory system in place to detect and deter
false or misleading statements it, or its agents, made to investors about risk management, it
violated Regulation 166.3.

C. Szilagyi Is Liable as a Control Person for Catalystâs Misconduct

Section 13(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13c(b) (2012), provides that âany person who,
directly or indirectly, controls any person who has violated any provision of this Act... may be
held liable for such violation in any action brought by the Commission to the same extent as such
controlled person.â For liability to attach, the Commission also âhas the burden of proving that
the controlling person did not act in good faith or knowingly induced, directly or indirectly, the
act or acts constituting the violation.â /d. To prove lack of good faith, the Division may show
that a controlling person âdid not maintain a reasonably adequate system of internal supervision
and control over the [primary violator] or did not enforce with any reasonable diligence such a
system.â Monieson, 996 F.2d at 860; see also CFTC vy. Sentinel Mgmt. Grp. Inc., No. 08-2410,
2012 WL 3234277, at *5 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 6, 2012).

Because Szilagyi controlled Catalyst and failed to âmaintain a reasonably adequate
system of internal supervisionâ designed to prevent the violations described above, Szilagyi is
liable for Catalystâs violations of Section 40(1)(B) of the Act and Regulation 166.3.

IV. FINDINGS OF VIOLATION

Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that Catalyst and Szilagyi violated Section
40(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 60(1)(B) (2012), and Regulation 166.3, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 166.3 (2019).
