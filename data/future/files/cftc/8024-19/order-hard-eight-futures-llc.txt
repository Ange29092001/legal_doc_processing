ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTION 6(c) AND (d) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, MAKING
FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

I. INTRODUCTION

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ) has reason to believe that
from March 2014 through March 2015 (âRelevant Periodâ), Hard Eight Futures, LLC (âHard
Eightâ or âRespondentâ), by and through the acts of one of its traders, violated Section
Ac(a)(5)(C) of the Commodity Exchange Act (âActâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6c(a)(5)(C) (2012), Section
6(c)(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 9(1) (2012), and Regulation 180.1(a)(1) and (3), 17 C.F.R.

Â§ 180.1(a)(1), (3) (2018), of the Commission Regulations (âRegulationsâ). Therefore, the
Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest that public administrative
proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted to determine whether Respondent engaged in the
violations set forth herein and to determine whether any order should be issued imposing
remedial sanctions. .

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Respondent has
submitted an Offer of Settlement (âOfferââ), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Without admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, Respondent consents to
the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Section 6(c) and (d) of the Commodity
Exchange Act, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (âOrderâ) and acknowledges
service of this Order.'

 

' Respondent consents to the use of the findings of fact and conclusions of law in this Order in this proceeding and
in any other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party or claimant, and agrees
that they shall be taken as true and correct and be given preclusive effect therein, without further proof. Respondent
does not consent, however, to the use of this Order, or the findings or conclusions herein, as the sole basis for any
other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party or claimant, other than: a
proceeding in bankruptcy or receivership; or a proceeding to enforce the terms of this Order. Respondent does not
consent to the use of the Offer or this Order, or the findings or conclusions in this Order, by any other party in any
other proceeding.
II. FINDINGS
The Commission finds the following:
A. SUMMARY

From March 2014 through March 2015 (âRelevant Periodâ), Hard Eight, by and through
one of its traders, engaged in manipulative or deceptive acts, including âspoofingââbidding or
offering with the intent to cancel the bid or offer before executionâin connection with trading
the E-mini S&P 500 futures contract (âE-miniâ) on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (âCMEâ),
a registered entity, in violation of the Act and Regulations.

This conduct violates Section 4c(a)(5)(C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6c(a)(5)(C) (2012),
which prohibits spoofing, as well as Section 6(c)(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 9(1) (2012), and
Regulation 180.1(a)(1) and (3), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 180.1(a)(1), (3) (2018), which prohibit the use of any
manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in connection with any contract for future
delivery on or subject to the rules of a registered entity, here, the CME.

Hard Eight committed these violations by and through Trader A, a partner of, and trader
for, Hard Eight. Hard Eight is therefore liable for these violations pursuant to Section 2(a)(1)(B)
of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(a)(1)(B) (2012), and Regulation 1.2, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.2 (2018).

B. RESPONDENT

Hard Eight Futures, LLC is an Illinois limited liability company with its principal place
of business in Chicago, Illinois. Hard Eight was not registered with the Commission in any
capacity during the Relevant Period.

Trader A has never been registered with the Commission in any capacity.
Cc. FACTS

During the Relevant Period, Hard Eight, by and through Trader A, placed bids and offers
for futures contracts on Globex, the CMEâs electronic trading platform, in the E-mini contract
with the intent to cancel those orders before execution (âSpoof Ordersâ). At the time the Spoof

Orders were placed and cancelled, they constituted a substantial percentage of the best bid or
offer.

Trader A placed Spoof Orders in order to create the false impression of significant buying
or selling interest. Trader A used this false impression of buying or selling interest, or the
sudden and dramatic removal thereof, to induce other market participants to transact with orders
that he wanted to be executed (âGenuine Ordersââ) at prices or in quantities favorable to Trader

A. Trader A engaged in this conduct on more than a thousand occasions during the Relevant
Period.

Trader Aâs manipulative trading took several forms. At times, Trader A entered Spoof
Orders to benefit Genuine Orders resting on the opposite side of the electronic order book. For
example, if Trader A wanted to execute a sell-side Genuine Order, he would place relatively
larger Spoof Orders (as measured by total contracts) on the buy side. Trader A did this to create
the false impression of increased demand to buy, which would indicate an imminent price
increase. Trader A intended for other traders to react by placing aggressive buy orders that
crossed the bid-ask spread and executed against his sell-side Genuine Order. Once Trader A
started getting fills on his Genuine Orders, Trader A would cancel his Spoof Orders.

At other times, traders would place orders at the same price level as Trader Aâs existing
Spoof Orders. When this occurred, Trader A would at times send an aggressive order to âflipâ
his bias from buy to sell (or vice versa) and use a wash-blocking functionality to virtually
simultaneously cancel his Spoof Orders, thus, for example, replacing his Spoof Order to sell with
an aggressive Genuine Order to buy at the same price level. This allowed Trader A to match
with the resting orders at that price level before other traders could react to the cancellation of
Trader Aâs Spoof Orders.

Finally, Trader A also canceled his Spoof Orders in a manner designed to create what is
sometimes referred to as a âvacuumââthat is, by canceling his Spoof Orders virtually
simultaneously to create the false impression of a sudden and significant decline in buying or
selling interest, thus indicating an imminent price decrease or increase. Trader A intended for
other traders to react to this âvacuumâ by placing aggressive orders that crossed the bid-ask
spread, to fill Genuine Orders Trader A left resting on the same side of the market as the
âvacuumâ he had created. This often resulted in Trader A successfully moving the market an
entire price level.

Trader A committed these violations within the course and scope of his capacity as a
partner of, and trader for, Hard Eight.

Il. LEGAL DISCUSSION
A. SPOOFING IN VIOLATION OF SECTION 4c(a)(5)(C) OF THE ACT

Section 4c(a)(5)(C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6c(a)(5)(C) (2012), prohibits any person from
engaging in any trading, practice, or conduct on or subject to the rules of a registered entity that
is, is of the character of, or is commonly known to the trade as, âspoofingâ (bidding or offering
with the intent to cancel the bid or offer before execution).

As described above, Hard Eight, by and through the acts of Trader A, entered numerous
bids or offers on a registered entity with the intent to cancel those bids or offers before execution.
Hard Eight therefore acted in violation of Section 4c(a)(5)\(C) of the Act. See, e.g., United States
v. Coscia, 866 F.3d 782, 795 (7th Cir. 2017) (â[A] conviction for spoofing requires that the
prosecution prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Coscia knowingly entered bids or offers
with the present intent to cancel the bid or offer prior to execution.â), rehâg and suggestion for
rehâg en banc denied (Sept. 5, 2017), cert. denied, 138 S. Ct. 1989, 201 L. Ed. 2d 249 (2018);
CFTC v. Oystacher, 203 F. Supp. 3d 934, 942 (N.D. Ill. 2016) (denying motion for judgment on
the pleadings for spoofing claim based on âflippingâ conduct); see also In re Mohan, CFTC No.
19-06, 2019 WL 978808, at *3 (Feb. 25, 2019) (consent order) (finding that entry of orders with
intent to cancel to benefit opposite-side resting orders constituted spoofing); In re Singhal, CFTC
No. 18-11, 2018 WL 1782904, at *1 (Apr. 9, 2018) (consent order) (finding that entry of orders
with intent to cancel to benefit opposite-side aggressive orders, i.e., âflipping,â constituted
spoofing).

B. USE OF A MANIPULATIVE OR DECEPTIVE SCHEME IN VIOLATION OF
SECTION 6(c)(1) of THE ACT AND REGULATION 180.1(a)

Section 6(c)(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 9(1) (2012), and corresponding Regulation
180.1(a)(1) and (3), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 180.1(a)(1), (3) (2018), prohibit any person, directly or
indirectly, in connection with any contract for future delivery on or subject to the rules of any
registered entity, from intentionally or recklessly using or employing, or attempting to use or
employ, any manipulative device, scheme, or artifice to defraud or engage, or attempting to
engage, in any act, practice, or course of business, which operates or would operate as a fraud or
deceit upon any person.

As described above, Hard Eight, by and through the acts of Trader A, recklessly or
intentionally employed a manipulative or deceptive scheme which created the false appearance
of buying or selling interest in the E-mini in order to induce other market participants to trade at
prices, or in quantities, favorable to Hard Eight. Hard Eight implemented this scheme through
the use of Spoof Orders, as described above, which were entered and cancelled in order to
benefit orders that Hard Eight, by and through the acts of Trader A, entered with intent to trade,
i.e., Genuine Orders. Accordingly, Hard Eight violated Section 6(c)(1) of the Act and
Regulation 180.1(a)(1) and (3). See CFTC v. Oystacher, No. 15-CV-09196, 2016 WL 8256391,
at *6 (N.D. Ill. Dec. 20, 2016) (consent order; finding spoofing conduct manipulative and
deceptive within the meaning of 180.1); see also Mohan, 2019 WL 978808, at *3 (âMohan,
along with others, employed a manipulative and deceptive scheme at Firm A wherein he entered
Spoof Orders to intentionally send false signals to the market that he actually wanted to buy or
sell the number of contracts specified in the Spoof Orders.â); In re Victory Asset, Inc., CFTC No.
18-36, 2018 WL 4563040, at *3 (Sept. 19, 2018) (consent order) (âVictory, by and through the
acts of Franko, employed a manipulative scheme wherein it created or exacerbated the
appearance of an order book imbalance in a manner that could and did affect market activity on
the domestic exchanges. Franko employed his scheme through Spoof Orders combined with
Genuine Orders.â).â

C. HARD EIGHT IS LIABLE FOR THE ACTS OF TRADER A

Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(a)(1)(B) (2012), and Regulation 1.2,
17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.2 (2018), provide that the âact, omission, or failure of any official, agent, or other
person acting for any individual, association, partnership, corporation, or trust within the scope
of his employment or office shall be deemed the act, omission, or failure of such individual,
association, partnership, corporation, or trust, as well as of such official, agent, or other person.â

 

Â° Cf Coscia, 866 F.3d at 797 (affirming conviction for commodities fraud based on spoofing; â[Cosciaâs] scheme
was deceitful because, at the time he placed the large orders, he intended to cancel the orders.â); CFTC v. Kraft
Foods Grp., Inc., 153 F. Supp. 3d 996, 1010 (N.D, III. 2015) (denying motion to dismiss Regulation 180.1 claim,
noting that âclaims of manipulation must involve âconduct designed to deceive or defraud investors by controlling or
artificially affecting the price of securitiesââ (quoting Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U.S. 185, 199 (1976))); SEC
v. Lek Sec. Corp., 276 F. Supp. 3d 49, 60 (S.D.N.Y. 2017) (denying motion to dismiss; âThe SEC has consistently
found layering and spoofing activity to violate Â§ 10(b) and Rule 10b-5.â).
Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act and Regulation 1.2 impose strict liability upon principals for the
actions of their agents acting within the scope of their employment.

Trader Aâs spoofing and manipulative or deceptive conduct occurred within the course
and scope of his employment, office, or agency as a partner and trader at Hard Eight. Therefore,
pursuant to Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, and Regulation 1.2, Hard Eight is liable for Trader Aâs
acts, omissions, and failures in violation of the provisions of the Act and Regulations cited
above. See Rosenthal & Co. v. CFTC, 802 F.2d 963, 966 (7th Cir. 1986) (â[W]e have no doubt
that section 2(a)(1) imposes strict liability on the principal... , provided, of course, as the statute
also states expressly, that the agentâs misconduct was within the scope or (equivalently but more
precisely) in furtherance of the agent.â).
