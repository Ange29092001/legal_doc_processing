ORDER OF DEFAULT FINAL JUDGMENT, PERMANENT INJUNCTION,
CIVIL MONETARY PENALTY, AND OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF AGAINST
DEFENDANTS JOSHUA CHRISTIAN MCDONALD AND PERFECTION PR
FIRM LLC

On February 14, 2020, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
(âCommissionâ or âPlaintiffâ) filed a Complaint charging Defendants Joshua Christian
McDonald (âMcDonaldâ) and Perfection PR Firm LLC (âPerfection PRâ) with violating
Sections 2(c)(2)(C)Gii)(D(cc), 4b(a)(2)(A)-(C), 4k(2), 4m(1), and 40(1)(A) and (B) of the
Commodity Exchange Act (âActâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 2(c)(2)(C))()(cc), 6b(a)(2)(A)-(C),
6k(2), 6m(1), 60(1)(A), (B) (2018), and Commission Regulations (âRegulationsâ)
4.20(a)-(c), 4.41 (a), 5.2(b), and 5.3(a)(2)(i) and (ii), 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 4.20(a)-(c), 4.41 (a),
5.2(b), 5.3(a)(2)G@)-Gi) (2019) . (ECF No. 1). On February 15, 2020, Defendants were

properly served with the summons and Complaint pursuant to Rule 4 of the Federal Rules

of Civil Procedure (âFed. R. Civ. P.â) by personal service. (ECF No. 5 at 2; ECF No. 6 at
ae AN A ag tN ge

2). Defendants have failed to appear or answer the Complaint within the time permitted
by Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(a)(1). Accordingly, the Commission filed motions for entry of a
clerkâs default against Defendants and on April 20, 2020, the Clerk of this Court entered
a default against Defendants. (ECF No. 10). The Commission has moved this Court to
grant final judgment by default against Defendants, order permanent injunctive relief, and
impose a restitution obligation and civil monetary penalty.

The Court has carefully considered the Complaint, the allegations of which are
well-pleaded and hereby taken as true, the Commissionâs memorandum in support of its
motion,! and the record in this case. Having been fully advised in the premises,

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Plaintiffs original Motion for Default
Judgment is DENIED as moot. (ECF No. 12).

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Plaintiff's Motion for Final Judgment by
Default, Permanent Injunction, Civil Monetary Penalty, and Other Equitable Relief
against Defendants is GRANTED. (ECF No. 14). Accordingly, the Court enters the
following findings of fact, conclusions of law, and Order of Final Judgment by Default
for Permanent Injunction, Civil Monetary Penalties, and Other Statutory and Equitable
Relief (âOrderâ) pursuant to Sections 6c and 6d of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2018), as

set forth herein.

 

' The memorandum in support of Plaintiff's motion for final judgment included the
declaration of Senior Futures Trading Investigator Dimitry Vilensky. (ECF No. 13-2).
Vilensky works in the Division of Enforcement of the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission and was assigned to investigate Defendantsâ actions. (/d. { {| 4-5).

I. FINDINGS OF FACT
A. The Parties

1. Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an independent
regulatory agency that is charged by Congress with the administration and enforcement
of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1-26 (2018), and the Regulations promulgated thereunder, 17
C.F.R. pts. 1-190 (2019). (ECF No. 1 Â¥ 14).

2. Defendant Joshua Christian McDonald is the founder and Chief
Executive Officer of Defendant Perfection PR Firm LLC. McDonald currently resides in
or around Georgetown, Texas. McDonald has never been registered with the
Commission. Ud. { 15; ECF. No. 13-2 Jf 14-15).

3. Defendant Perfection PR Firm LLC is a Delaware limited liability
company that McDonald formed on January 29, 2016, with a registered office in Newark,
Delaware. McDonald is the sole member of Perfection PR and controls its operations,
finances, accounts, and books and records. Perfection PR has never been registered with
the Commission. (ECF No. | J 16; ECF No. 13-2 Jf 16-18).

B. Operation of the Pool and Solicitation of Participants

4. From August 2017 through July 2018 (âthe Relevant Periodâ), McDonald,
individually and acting as an officer, employee, or agent of Perfection PR, solicited and
pooled $445,960 from thirteen individuals or entities (âPool Participantsâ), in connection
with the trading of retail foreign exchange (âforexâ) contracts. At the direction of
McDonald, Pool Participants deposited their investment funds, primarily via wire

transfer, into bank accounts in McDonaldâs name at Citibank N.A. (âCitibankâ) or in the
name of Perfection PR at Regions Bank (âRegionsâ). (ECF. No. 1 {| 17; ECF No. 13-2
7-8, 22, 26).

5. Pool Participants were introduced to McDonald by family members,
friends, or acquaintances, some of whom were offered referral fees by McDonald.
Following an introduction, McDonald communicated directly with existing and
prospective Pool Participants via telephone, email, text message, social media, and video
conferencing. In communications with prospective Pool Participants, McDonald touted
his purported forex trading expertise and successful track record, promised returns of
between 10% and 50% per month, and minimized the risk of loss. McDonald told at least
one prospective Pool Participant that her invested funds would be pooled with the
investment funds of other Pool Participants. (ECF. No. 1 { 18).

6. In December 2017 and January 2018, McDonald sent to at least three
prospective Pool Participants an email with the subject âForex Investment Introductionâ
that stated: âThank you for allowing us to show you this opportunity for investment in
our Forex program. Please find the following document attached, of our past & current
clientâs portfolios & historical information.â Attached to the email was a PDF document
named âFinal Investment Proposal,â which made representations about the amount of
profits Pool Participants could expect, among other things. The email also represented:
âCommission Percentage â Fee is taken off profits made for you per month: - $1k-$25k
Account â (40%) - $25k or more account â (35%)â. In the email, McDonald identified

himself as the âCEOâ of Perfection PR. (ECF No. 1 J 19; ECF. No. 13-4).
7. At the direction of McDonald, Pool Participants entered into a âForex
Investment Agreementâ with Perfection PR. The agreement stated that âPerfection PR
Firm LLC would like to offer investors a place in our Forex Trading Programâ and that
Perfection PR âoffers said investment opportunity & return on investment through Forex
trading.â The agreement stated that âthe minimum goal is 20% return on investment per
month. Yet the companyâs goal is to secure as much profit as possible.â The term of the
Forex Investment Agreement was typically between thirty and ninety days. McDonald
signed the agreements on behalf of Perfection PR. (ECF No. 1 { 20).

8. In December 2017, McDonald formed a second entity in Delaware,
Perfection Forex LP (âPerfection Forexâ). McDonald was the sole general partner of
Perfection Forex. Via a website and social media accounts, McDonald and Perfection
Forex solicited the public to deposit funds for forex trading training, trading signals, and
managed accounts. Beginning in or about March 2018 and continuing through at least
June 2018, McDonald commingled funds collected from Perfection Forex customers with
Pool Participant funds in McDonaldâs personal Citibank account. Ud. { 21).

9. At least one Pool Participant was not an eligible contract participant
(âECPâ) and the commodity pool operated by Defendants was not an ECP, as that term is
defined in Section 1a(18) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1a(18) (2018). Ud. Jf 7, 22).

10. On May 4, 2018, McDonald sent an email message to one Pool Participant,
M.B., stating that Perfection PR âregrets to inform you that the portfolio and trades made
throughout the investment were not as successful as we had hoped, based off of market

conditions and movements of trades the portfolio final overview and result was a loss...

5
With [current events] we continually fell behind with losses... At this time Perfection PR
Firm LLC and the relationship with the client has come to an end, due to depletion of
funds, based off loss.â Ud. { 23).

11. McDonald eventually stopped responding to communications from all Pool
Participants and has failed to return their remaining investment funds despite repeated
requests. (Ud. { 24).

12. Although Perfection PR did not meet the requirements for exemption, on
May 20, 2018, McDonald filed with the National Futures Association (âNFAâ) a notice
of exemption under Commission Regulation 4.13(a)(2), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 4.13(a)(2) (2019),
for a pool called âPerfection PR Firm Forex Investment Program.â The exemption notice
was withdrawn on March 4, 2019. (Ud. { 25; ECF No. 13-2 Â¥ 18).

C. Trading and Misappropriation of Funds

13. In or about June 2017, McDonald opened a trading account in his own
name at a retail foreign exchange dealer (âRFEDâ) registered with the Commission
(âRFED personal accountâ) and, in August 2017, began depositing Pool Participantsâ
funds into the account. From August 2017 to February 2018, McDonald deposited a total
of $119,610 of Pool Participantsâ funds and made withdrawals totaling $135,502.28.
McDonald engaged in leveraged or margined forex transactions in the account. By

month, the RFED personal account showed the following profit and loss:

(ECF No. 1 ] 26; ECF No. 13-2 4 36, 38).

14. Overall, McDonald had a cumulative profit of approximately $15,890 in the
RFED personal account for the ten months that it was traded. On March 6, 2018,
McDonald withdrew all funds remaining in the RFED personal account (approximately
$106,000) and ceased trading in that account. (ECF No. 1 27; ECF No. 13-24] 36).

15. In January 2018, McDonald opened a second trading account with the same
RFED in the name of Perfection PR (âRFED corporate accountâ) and in the same month
deposited a total of $150,000 of Pool Participantsâ funds. In February 2018, McDonald
made withdrawals totaling $105,513.81. McDonald engaged in leveraged or margined
forex transactions in the account. By month, the RFED corporate account showed the

following profit and loss:

~ ae AN A ag tN ge
Sega SPP Py PR TASS
oR AS SRA SAS oy

(ECF No. 1 { 28; ECF No. 13-2 J 38).

16. Overall, the RFED corporate account suffered a cumulative loss of
$43,998.09 during the two months that it was actively traded. On February 27, 2018,
McDonald withdrew all funds remaining in the RFED corporate account (approximately
$105,000) and ceased trading in that account. (ECF No. 1 { 29; ECF No. 13-2 { 38).

17. From December 2017 through May 2018, McDonald transferred via wire
transfer a total of $294,000âincluding $165,000 of the funds withdrawn from the RFED
accounts in February and March 2018âfrom Perfection PRâs Regions account to a
Bulgaria bank account in the name of a Belize-registered company that offers internet-
based leveraged or margined forex trading. During the same period, McDonald returned
a total of $88,649 from the Belize forex firm to Perfection PRâs Regions account. (ECF
No. | { 30; ECF No. 13-2 { 30). The Belize forex firm is not registered with the
Commission. (ECF No. 13-2 J 41).

18. Although Pool Participants deposited funds with Defendants only for the
purpose of forex trading, during the Relevant Period, McDonald transferred via wire
transfer and ACH $90,831.01 from his Citibank account and Perfection PRâs Regions
account to companies selling cryptocurrency or offering accounts for holding
cryptocurrency. During that period, only approximately $24,178.71 was returned from
the cryptocurrency companies. (ECF No. 1 9.31; ECF No. 13-2 731).

19. | While McDonald transferred a greater amount from the forex trading
accounts and cryptocurrency companies back to the Citibank and Regions accounts

during the Relevant Period, he returned only $105,394.79 to the thirteen known Pool

8
Participants as redemptions or purported profits. This figure includes $20,000 that was
paid to one Pool Participant who had already redeemed the full amount of its initial
investment. The other twelve Pool Participants suffered losses as a result of Defendants
scheme, totaling $360,565.21. McDonald used the remaining funds for personal
expenses such as rent, food, travel, and shopping, paying by electronic funds transfers,
debit card purchases, and checks. (ECF No. 1 32; ECF No. 13-2 {Â¥ 9, 11, 26-28).

20.  Atall relevant ttmes, McDonald was the sole signatory on the bank
accounts at Citibank and Regions. He was also the sole person authorized to trade in the
RFED accounts. McDonald transferred funds to and received funds from the Belize
forex firm and provided at least one Pool Participant with a purported trade statement
from the Belize forex firm. Accordingly, at all relevant times McDonald had personal
knowledge of the total amount of funds transferred to him from Pool Participants, the
disposition of those funds, the trades effected in the RFED accounts and the account(s)
with the Belize forex firm, and the performance of his trading. (ECF No. 1 { 34).

D. Material Misrepresentations and Omissions to Pool Participants

21. In soliciting funds from existing and prospective Pool Participants during
the Relevant Period, McDonald made material misrepresentations and omissions, orally
and in writing, regarding his trading expertise, his trading track record, and the
performance of Pool Participantsâ investments. (/d. { 35).

22. For example, in or about early November 2017, in soliciting investment
funds from Pool Participant M.B., McDonald represented via telephone that he had been

very successful trading forex and that his firm was managing several million dollars in

9
client assets. McDonald also told M.B. that only 2% to 4% of his investment would be at
risk and that the expected monthly rate of return for his investment was between 10% and
50%. Ud. J 36).

23. In fact, in October 2017, Defendants had only one client who had invested
$10,000 in August 2017, and McDonald had transferred almost the entire $10,000 to the
RFED personal account. Additionally, at that point, McDonaldâs forex trading in the
RFED personal account had earned only very modest monthly profits and had suffered an
overall loss in August 2017. Ud. Â¥ 37).

24.  Inor around November 2017, while soliciting investment funds from Pool
Participant S.R., McDonald represented that her funds would be pooled with the funds of
other participants and be used to trade forex; promised that she would receive a 20% to
50% monthly return on her investment, with a maximum risk of only 10% loss; and
claimed that he had been trading forex for four years and had never suffered a loss. (/d. J
38).

25. In reality, McDonald opened his first known forex trading account with an
RFED in June 2017. In the application to open this account, McDonald stated that he had
less than six months experience in trading futures, options, and forex. Moreover,
McDonaldâs forex trading in that account had not earned consistent profits in the
percentages promised to Pool Participants. (/d. { 39).

26. In soliciting them to deposit investment funds, McDonald provided a PDF
document called âFinal Investment Proposalâ to Pool Participants M.B. (in November

2017), K.B. (on December 24, 2017), and M.D. (on January 7, 2018), as well as

10
prospective Pool Participant P.D. (on December 13, 2017). The document stated, among
other things:

a) âWe offer investment management by trading our clientâs capital
in the Forex Markets. (Foreign Exchange Market)â;

b) âWe have consistently brought a monthly return of 20% on our
clientâs investments.â;

c) ââPerfection Forexâ has had 100% success rate with all of our
clients, we have brought a minimum monthly return of 20% or
more in profits.â; and

d) âWith clients ranging from $10,000 to $1,000,000 Million plus.â

(Id. J 40; ECF No. 13-4 at 9-10).

27. The âFinal Investment Proposalâ showed purported examples of returns
earned by clients, including a $1 million deposit that earned 226.5% profit in six months
and a $100,000 deposit that earned over 200% profit in two months. The âFinal
Investment Proposalâ also displayed images of a trading account mobile phone
application, which listed completed trades and showed large overall returns. (ECF No. 1 {
41; ECF No. 13-4 at 10-11).

28. In fact, Defendants never had a client who deposited one million dollarsâ
the largest total investment by any one Pool Participant was $150,000âand McDonaldâs
trading results were inconsistent, with overall losses in some months. Additionally, the
trades displayed in the images did not occur in the RFED trading accounts and no Pool
Participant had earned the depicted large returns. (ECF No. 1 {| 42).

29. During the Relevant Period, McDonald, both orally and in written account

statements or updates, periodically represented to Pool Participants that their investments

11
had increased in value due to his successful forex trading, when in fact in some months
McDonaldâs forex trading produced losses. (/d. { 43).

30. For example, in a Facebook Messenger conversation with Pool Participant
R.P. on December 3, 2017, McDonald stated âyou are at 20% for the first month.â
However, McDonaldâs trading in the RFED personal account actually produced overall
losses exceeding $10,000 in November 2017. Ud. J 44).

31. Onor about February 12, 2018, McDonald sent to Pool Participant S.R. by
email or text message an account update on Perfection PR and Perfection Forex
letterhead, representing that the Defendantsâ forex trading was âproviding 20% for your
first month with us.â The account update included no actual trade history report or
statement. Similarly, on February 8, 2018, McDonald sent to Pool Participant K.B. via
email a âForex Earnings Reportâ on Perfection PR and Perfection Forex letterhead. The
report represented that Defendantsâ forex trading had earned K.B. a 30% profit for the
previous month. In truth, McDonaldâs trading in January 2018 produced overall losses of
over $33,000 in the RFED personal account and over $48,000 in the RFED corporate
account. (Ud. J 45; ECF No. 13-2 { 38; ECF. No. 13-4 at 29).

32. During the Relevant Period, McDonald failed to disclose to Pool
Participants that he suffered trading losses or the extent of those losses. He also failed to
disclose that, rather than trade forex contracts, he used some pooled funds to purchase
cryptocurrency and to pay for personal expenses such as rent, groceries, fast food,

medical care, and shopping. (ECF No. 1 { 46). In total, $311,9669.21 of the Pool

12
Participantsâ investment funds were used for purposes other than making redemptions to
participants and forex trading. (ECF No. 13-2 { 11).

A. Jurisdiction and Venue

33. | This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 6c of the
Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2018), which provides that whenever it shall appear to the
Commission that a person has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in any act or
practice constituting a violation of any provision of the Act or any rule, regulation, or
order thereunder, the Commission may bring an action for injunctive relief in the proper
district court of the United States against such person to enjoin such act or practice, or to
enforce compliance with the Act, or any rule, regulation or other thereunder.

34. | Venue properly lies with this Court pursuant to 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(e),
because the Defendants transacted business in this jurisdiction and the acts and practices
in violation of the Act and Regulations occurred, are occurring or are about to occur
within this District, among other places. In particular, Defendants solicited funds from
and communicated with three Pool Participants who resided within this District. (ECF
No. 1 { 13; ECF No. 13-2 J 21 (âFive of these known Pool Participants resided in
Missouri, two of whom were located in Franklin County and one in Phelps County.â)).
B. Violations of 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6b(a)(2)(A)-(C) and 17 C.F.R. Â§ 5.2(b)

35. Section 4b(a)(2)(A)-(C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6b(a)(2)(A)-(C) (2018),

makes it unlawful:

13
      

for any person, in or in connection with any order to make, or the making of,
any contract of sale of any commodity for future delivery, or swap, that is

defraud or attempt to cheat or defraud the other person; (B) willfully to make
or cause to be made to the other person any false report or statement or
willfully to enter or cause to be entered for the other person any false record;
[or] (C) willfully to deceive or attempt to deceive the other person by any
means whatsoever in regard to any order or contract or the disposition or
execution of any order or contract, or in regard to any act of agency
performed, with respect to any order or contract for or, in the case of
paragraph (2), with the other person[.]

36. Pursuant to Section 2(c)(2)(C)(iv) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(c)(2)(C) (iv)
(2018), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6b applies to the forex transactions, agreements, or contracts offered
and traded by Defendants as if they were contracts of sale of a commodity for future
delivery.

37. Regulation 5.2(b), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 5.2(b) (2019), makes it unlawful:

for any person, by use of the mails or by any means or instrumentality of

interstate commerce, directly or indirectly, in or in connection with any retail

forex transaction: (1) To cheat or defraud or attempt to cheat or defraud any
person; (2) Willfully to make or cause to be made to any person any false
report or statement or cause to be entered for any person any false record; or

(3) Willfully to deceive or attempt to deceive any person by any means

whatsoever.

38. As described herein, Defendants violated 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6b(a)(2)(A)-(C) and 17
C.F.R. Â§ 5.2(b) by cheating or defrauding, or attempting to cheat or defraud, other
persons; issuing or causing to be issued false statements and records; and willfully
deceiving or attempting to deceive other persons in connection with the offering of, or

entering into, the off-exchange leveraged or margined forex transactions alleged herein,

by, among other things: (1) fraudulently soliciting Pool Participants and prospective Pool

14
Participants by making material misrepresentations and omissions about Defendantsâ
forex trading experience, Defendantsâ trading abilities and profits, Defendantsâ use of
deposited funds, and Defendantsâ registration status; (11) misappropriating Pool
Participantsâ funds; and (111) fabricating false records and account statements.

39. | Defendants engaged in the acts and practices described above using
instrumentalities of interstate commerce, including but not limited to: interstate wires for
transfer of funds, telephone, e-mail, text messages, and other electronic communication
devices.

40. Defendants engaged in the acts and practices described above knowingly,
willfully, or with reckless disregard for the truth.

41. The foregoing acts of fraudulent solicitation, misappropriation, and false
statements by McDonald occurred within the course and scope of his employment,
agency, or office with Perfection PR. Therefore, pursuant to Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the
Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(a)(1)(B) (2018), and Regulation 1.2, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.2 (2019), Perfection
PR is liable for McDonaldâs violations of the Act and Regulations, as alleged in this
count.

42. McDonald controlled Perfection PR, directly or indirectly, and did not act
in good faith or knowingly induced, directly or indirectly, the acts constituting Perfection
PRâs violations of the Act and Regulations alleged in this count. Therefore, pursuant to
Section 13(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13c(b) (2018), McDonald is liable for Perfection

PRâs violations of the Act and Regulations, as alleged in this count.

15
C. Violations of 7 U.S.C. Â§ 60(1) and 17 C.F.R. Â§ 4.41(a)

artifice to defraud any client or participant or prospective client or

participant; or (B) to engage in any transaction, practice, or course of

business which operates as a fraud or deceit upon any client or participant or

prospective client or participant.

44. Regulation 5.4, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 5.4 (2019), states that Part 4 of the Regulations,
17 C.F.R. pt. 4 (2019), applies to any person required to register as a CPO pursuant to
Part 5 of the Regulations related to off-exchange forex transactions, 17 C.F.R. pt. 5
(2019).

45. Regulation 4.41(a), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 4.41(a) (2019), makes it unlawful for any
CPO, or any principal thereof, to publish, distribute, or broadcast, whether by electronic
media or otherwise, any report, letter, circular, memorandum, publication, writing,
advertisement, or other literature or advice that â(1) employs any device, scheme, or
artifice to defraud any participant or client or prospective participant or client; or (2)

involves any transaction, practice or course of business which operates as a fraud or

deceit upon any participant or client or any prospective participant or client[.]â

 

? Regulation 5.1(d)(2), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 5.1(d)(2) (2018), defines an associated person, for
purposes of the Part 5 of the Regulations relating to forex transactions, as any natural

involved in the solicitation of funds, securities, or property, or the supervision of any
such person so engaged.

16
46. As alleged herein, Defendant Perfection PR was required to register as a
CPO during the Relevant Period.

47. As set forth above, during the Relevant Period, Perfection PR, through
McDonald, acted as a CPO by soliciting, accepting, or receiving funds from the public
while engaged in a business that is of the nature of an investment trust, syndicate, or
similar form of enterprise, for the purpose of, among other things, trading in off-exchange
leveraged or margined forex contracts. See 7 U.S.C. Â§1a(11) (2018). McDonald acted as
an AP of Perfection PR. See 17 C.F.R. Â§ 5.1(d)(2) (2019).

48. McDonald and Perfection PR, through McDonald, violated 7 U.S.C. Â§
60(1)(A) and (B) and 17 C.F.R. Â§ 4.41(a) in that by use of the mails or any other means
or instrumentality of interstate commerce they employed or are employing a device,
scheme or artifice to defraud prospective and existing Pool Participants or engaged or are
engaging in transactions, practices, or a course of business which operated or operates as
a fraud or deceit upon Pool Participants or prospective Pool Participants.

49. The foregoing acts and/or omissions by McDonald occurred within the
scope of his employment, office, or agency with Perfection PR. Therefore, pursuant to
Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(a)(1)(B) (2018), and Regulation 1.2, 17
C.F.R. Â§ 1.2 (2019), Perfection PR is liable for McDonaldâs violations of the Act and
Regulations, as alleged in this count.

50. McDonald controlled, directly or indirectly, Perfection PR and did not act
in good faith, or knowingly induced, directly or indirectly, Perfection PR to commit the

acts and/or omissions alleged herein. Therefore, pursuant to Section 13(b) of the Act, 7

17
U.S.C. Â§ 13c(b) (2018), McDonald is liable for Perfection PRâs violations of the Act and

Regulations, as alleged in this count.

D. Violation of 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 2(c)(2)(C)(Gii)(1D) (cc) and 6m(1) and 17 C.F.R. Â§
5.3(a)(2)()

51. Section 2(c)(2)(C)ai)(1)(cc) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(c)(2)(C) au) (ec)
(2018), prohibits any person from operating or soliciting funds, securities, or property for
any pooled investment vehicle that is not an ECP in connection with agreements,
contracts, or transactions in forex, unless registered with the Commission, with certain
exceptions not applicable to Defendants.

52. Section 4m(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6m(1) (2018), makes it unlawful for
any CPO, unless registered with the Commission, to make use of the mails or any means
or instrumentality of interstate commerce in connection with its business as a CPO.

53. Regulation 5.3(a)(2)(), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 5.3(a)(2)G) (2019), requires any CPO
engaged in retail forex transactions to register with the Commission. Regulation
5.1(d)(1), 17 C-F.R. Â§ 5.1(d)(1) (2019), defines a CPO as any person who âoperates or
solicits funds, securities, or property for a pooled investment vehicle . . . that engages in
retail forex transactions[.]â

54. During the Relevant Period, Perfection PR, which was not exempt from
registration as a CPO, acted as a CPO and made use of the mails or any means or
instrumentality of interstate commerce in connection with its business as a CPO by
operating or soliciting funds for a pooled investment vehicle that is not an ECP and that

engages in retail forex transactions. Perfection PR engaged in this conduct without being

18
registered with the Commission in violation of 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 2(c)(2)(C)Gi)()(cc) and
6m(1) and 17 C.F.R. Â§ 5.3(a)(2)().

55. | McDonald controlled Perfection PR, directly or indirectly, and did not act
in good faith and knowingly induced, directly or indirectly, Perfection PR to commit the
acts and/or omissions alleged herein. Therefore, pursuant to Section 13(b) of the Act, 7
U.S.C. Â§ 13c(b) (2018), McDonald is liable for Perfection PRâs violations of the Act and
Regulations, as alleged in this count.

E. Violation of 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 2(c)(2)(C)Gii)(D)(cc) and 6k(2) and 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 3.12
and 5.3(a)(2)(ii)

56. Section 2(c)(2)(C)ai)(1)(cc) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(c)(2)(C) au) (ec)
(2018), prohibits any person from operating or soliciting funds, securities, or property for
any pooled investment vehicle that is not an ECP in connection with agreements,
contracts, or transactions in forex, unless registered with the Commission, with certain
exceptions not applicable to Defendants.

57. Section 4k(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6k(2) (2018), and Regulation
5.3(a)(2)G1), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 5.3(a)(2)(i1) (2019), require registration with the Commission
for any person who is associated with a CPO as a partner, officer, employee, consultant,
or agent (or any person occupying a similar status or performing similar functions), in
any capacity that involves the solicitation of funds, securities, or property for
participation in a commodity pool or the supervision of any person or persons so

engaged.

19
58. Regulation 3.12, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 3.12 (2019), prohibits any person from being
an AP of a CPO unless that person is registered with the Commission as an AP of the
sponsoring CPO.

59. Regulation 5.1(d)(2), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 5.1(d)(2) (2019), defines an associated
person, for purposes of the Part 5 of the Regulations relating to forex transactions, as any
natural person associated with a CPO as a partner, officer, employee, consultant, or agent
that is involved in the solicitation of funds, securities, or property, or the supervision of
any such person so engaged.

60. During the Relevant Period, McDonald acted as an AP of a CPO by (i)
soliciting funds, securities, or property for participation in a commodity pool operated by
Perfection PR, and (11) operating or soliciting funds, securities, or property for the
Perfection PR pooled investment vehicle, which was not an ECP, in connection with off-
exchange leveraged or margined forex transactions. McDonald engaged in this conduct
without being registered with the Commission as an AP or CPO Perfection PR, in
violation of 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 2(c)(2)(C)Gu)(D)(cc) and 6k(2) and 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 3.12 and
5.3(a)(2)(ii).

61. The foregoing acts by McDonald occurred within the scope of his
employment, office, or agency with Perfection PR. Therefore, pursuant to Section
2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(a)(1)(B) (2018), and Regulation 1.2, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.2
(2019), Perfection PR is liable for McDonaldâs violations of the Act and Regulations, as

alleged in this count.

20
F. Violations of 17 C.F.R. Â§ 4.20(a)(1), (b), and (c)

62. Regulation 4.20(a)(1), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 4.20(a) (2019), requires a CPO to
operate its pool as a legal entity separate from that of the CPO.

63. Regulation 4.20(b), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 4.20(b) (2019), requires that all funds,
securities, or other property received by a CPO from a prospective or existing Pool
Participant must be received in the commodity poolâs name.

64. Regulation 4.20(c), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 4.20(c) (2019), prohibits a CPO from
comingling the property of any pool it operates with the property of any other person.

65. As set forth above, during the Relevant Period, Perfection PR, acting
through McDonald and while acting as a CPO, violated 17 C.F.R. Â§ 4.20(a), (b), and (c)
by: (i) failing to operate the commodity pool as a legal entity separate from Perfection
PR, the CPO; (ii) receiving Pool Participant funds in the name of Perfection PR, rather
than in the name of the commodity pool; and (111) commingling the property of the
commodity pool with the funds of McDonald and Perfection PR, including the proceeds
of a separate business operated by McDonald.

66. McDonald controlled Perfection PR, directly or indirectly, and did not act
in good faith and knowingly induced, directly or indirectly, Perfection PR to commit the
acts and/or omissions alleged herein. Therefore, pursuant to Section 13(b) of the Act, 7
U.S.C. Â§ 13c(b) (2018), McDonald is liable for Perfection PRâs violations of the Act and

Regulations, as alleged in this count.

21
G. An Injunction is Warranted

67. Unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, there is a reasonable
likelihood that Defendants McDonald and Perfection PR will continue to engage in the
acts and practices alleged in the Complaint and in similar acts and practices in violation
of the Act and Regulations.

5.2(b), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 5.2(b);

b. Employing a scheme to defraud or engaging in any transaction, practice,

23
IV. RESTITUTION AND CIVIL MONETARY PENALTY
A. Restitution

70. 7US.C. Â§ 13a-1(d)(3)(A) (2018) authorizes the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission to seek and the Court to order restitution to persons who have
sustained losses proximately caused by Defendantsâ misconduct. See U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commân y. First Capitol Futures Grp., No. 1:09-00488-CV-W-DW,
2010 WL 1713617, at *11 (W.D. Mo. Feb. 18, 2010). Because the Court finds that
Defendantsâ fraudulent conduct proximately caused the losses sustained by the thirteen
known pool participants, Defendants shall pay, jointly and severally, restitution in the
amount of three hundred sixty thousand five hundred sixty-five dollars and twenty-
one cents ($360,565.21) (âRestitution Obligationâ). If the Restitution Obligation is not
paid immediately, post-judgment interest shall accrue on the Restitution Obligation
beginning on the date of entry of this Order and shall be determined by using the
Treasury Bill rate prevailing on the date of entry of this Order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Â§
1961 (2018).

71. Defendant McDonald is currently the defendant in a criminal action
charging him, in part, for the misconduct that is at issue in this matter. See United States
v. Joshua C. McDonald, No. 4:20-CR-70 SRC/SPM (E.D. Mo., filed Feb. 12, 2020)
(âCriminal Actionâ). For amounts disbursed to Defendant McDonaldâs Pool Participants
as a result of satisfaction of any restitution ordered in the Criminal Action, the
Defendants shall receive a dollar-for-dollar credit against the Restitution

Obligation. Within ten days of disbursement in the Criminal Action to Defendantsâ Pool

24
      

Participants, Defendant McDonald shall, under a cover letter that identifies the name and
docket number of this proceeding, transmit to the Chief Financial Officer, Commodity
Futures Trading Commission, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street, NW,
Washington, D.C. 20581, and the Office of Administration, National Futures Association,
300 South Riverside Plaza, Suite 1800, Chicago, Illinois 60606, copies of the form of
payment to those Pool Participants.

72. To effect payment of the Restitution Obligation and the distribution of any
restitution payments to Defendantsâ Pool Participants, the Court appoints the National
Futures Association (âNFAâ) as Monitor (âMonitorâ). The Monitor shall receive
restitution payments from Defendants and make distributions as set forth below. Because
the Monitor is acting as an officer of this Court in performing these services, the NFA
shall not be liable for any action or inaction arising from NFAâs appointment as Monitor,
other than actions involving fraud.

73. Defendants shall make Restitution Obligation payments, and any post-
judgment interest payments, under this Order to the Monitor in the name âPerfection PR
Firm Restitution Fundâ and shall send such payments by electronic funds transfer, or by
U.S. postal money order, certified check, bank cashierâs check, or bank money order, to
the Office of Administration, National Futures Association, 300 South Riverside Plaza,
Suite 1800, Chicago, Illinois 60606, under cover letter that identifies the paying
Defendants and the name and docket number of this proceeding. Defendants shall

simultaneously transmit copies of the cover letter and the form of payment to the Chief

25
       

Financial Officer, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Three Lafayette Centre,
1155 21st Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20581.

74. | The Monitor shall oversee the Restitution Obligation and shall have the
discretion to determine the manner of distribution of such funds in an equitable fashion to
Defendantsâ Pool Participants identified by the Commission or may defer distribution
until such time as the Monitor deems appropriate. In the event that the amount of
Restitution Obligation payments to the Monitor are of a de minimis nature such that the
Monitor determines that the administrative cost of making a distribution to eligible Pool
Participants is impractical, the Monitor may, in its discretion, treat such restitution
payments as civil monetary penalty payments, which the Monitor shall forward to the
Commission following the instructions for civil monetary penalty payments set forth in
Paragraph 81 below.

75. Defendants shall cooperate with the Monitor as appropriate to provide such
information as the Monitor deems necessary and appropriate to identify Defendantsâ Pool
Participants to whom the Monitor, in its sole discretion, may determine to include in any
plan for distribution of any Restitution Obligation payments. Defendants shall execute
any documents necessary to release funds that they have in any repository, bank,
investment or other financial institution, wherever located, in order to make partial or
total payment toward the Restitution Obligation.

76. |The Monitor shall provide the Commission at the beginning of each
calendar year with a report detailing the disbursement of funds to Defendantsâ Pool

Participants during the previous year. The Monitor shall transmit this report under a

26
cover letter that identifies the name and docket number of this proceeding to the Chief
Financial Officer, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Three Lafayette Centre,
1155 21st Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20581.

77. The amounts payable to each pool participant shall not limit the ability of
any pool participant of proving that a greater amount is owed from Defendants or any
other person or entity, and nothing herein shall be construed in any way to limit or
abridge the rights of any pool participant that exist under state or common law.

78. Pursuant to Rule 71 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, each pool
participant of Defendantsâ who suffered a loss is explicitly made an intended third-party
beneficiary of this Order and may seek to enforce obedience of this Order to obtain
satisfaction of any portion of the Restitution Obligation that has not been paid by
Defendants to ensure continued compliance with any provision of this Order and to hold
Defendants in contempt for any violations of any provision of this Order.

79. To the extent that any funds accrue to the U.S. Treasury for satisfaction of
Defendantsâ Restitution Obligation, such funds shall be transferred to the Monitor for
disbursement in accordance with the procedures set forth above.

B. Civil Monetary Penalty
80. 7U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(d)(1)(A) (2018) authorizes the imposition of a civil

monetary penalty (âCMPâ) equal to the higher of $185,242 per violation? or triple a

 

> Pursuant to 17 C.F.R. Â§ 143.8(b)(1) (2019), the allowable inflation-adjusted civil
monetary penalty is $185,242 per violation of the Act (effective Jan. 13, 2020) for non-
manipulation claims brought in federal injunctive actions under 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1.

27
defendantâs monetary gain from each violation of the Act or Regulations. Because the
Court finds that Defendantsâ misconduct was serious and pervasive, Defendants shall
pay, jointly and severally, a civil monetary penalty in the amount of nine hundred
thirty-five thousand nine hundred seven dollars and sixty-three cent ($935,907.63)
(âCMP Obligationâ). This is equal to three times the amount of funds not returned to
investors and not lost to trading a registered RFED ($311,969.21). If the CMP
Obligation is not paid immediately, then post-judgment interest shall accrue on the CMP
Obligation beginning on the date of entry of this Order and shall be determined by using
the Treasury Bill rate prevailing on the date of entry of this Order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Â§
1961 (2018).

81. Defendants shall pay their CMP Obligation and any post-judgment interest
by electronic funds transfer, U.S. postal money order, certified check, bank cashierâs
check, or bank money order. If payment is to be made other than by electronic funds
transfer, then the payment shall be made payable to the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission and sent to the address below:

If payment by electronic funds transfer is chosen, Defendants shall contact Marie Thorne

or her successor at the address above to receive payment instructions and shall fully

28
comply with those instructions. Defendants shall accompany payment of the CMP
Obligation with a cover letter that identifies the payor and the name and docket number
of this proceeding. Defendants shall simultaneously transmit copies of the cover letter
and the form of payment to the Chief Financial Officer, Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street, NW, Washington, DC 20581.
C. Provisions Related to Monetary Sanctions

82. Partial Satisfaction: Acceptance by the Commission or the Monitor of any
partial payment of the Defendantsâ Restitution Obligation or CMP Obligation shall not be
deemed a waiver of their obligation to make further payments pursuant to this Order, or a
waiver of the Commissionâs right to seek to compel payment of any remaining balance.
