ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFFâS MOTION FOR
DEFAULT JUDGMENT, PERMANENT INJUNCTION,

CIVIL MONETARY PENALTY, AND EQUITABLE RELIEF

Before the Court is Plaintiff U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commissionâs
(âPlaintiff,â âCFTC,â or âCommissionâ) Motion for Entry of Default Judgment, Permanent
Injunction, Civil Monetary Penalty, and Equitable Relief against Defendants Alcibiades
Cifuentes (âCifuentesâ), Jennifer Wee Cifuentes (âWeeâ), and Cifuentes Fund Management,
LLC (âCFMâ), (collectively, âDefendantsâ), pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
55(b)(2) and New Jersey Court Rule 4:43-2. For the reasons stated below and good cause
having been shown, the motion is GRANTED.

I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY
1. On September 30, 2016, the CFTC filed a Complaint for Injunctive and Other

Equitable Relief and for Civil Monetary Penalties Under the Commodity Exchange Act and.

Commission Regulations (âComplaintâ) against Defendants for violations of the Commodity
Exchange Act (the âActâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1-26 (2012), and its implementing regulations
(âRegulationsâ), 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1.1-190.10 (2015). (ECF No. 1).

2. The Complaint alleges that, from at least April 2013 through March 2015 (the
âRelevant Periodâ), Cifuentes and Wee, through CFM, engaged in a fraudulent scheme to
solicit funds for a pooled investment vehicle trading in off-exchange leveraged or margined
foreign currency (âforexâ) contracts. Rather than use customersâ funds to trade forex
contracts as promised, Defendants misappropriated the money entrusted to them for the
benefit of Cifuentes and Wee.

3. On October 13, 2016, Plaintiff, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
4(e)(1) and 4(h)(1)(B), caused a copy of the Summons and Complaint to be served on CFMâs
registered agent in Wilmington, Delaware. (Ex. C to Decl. of Daniel J. Grimm (âGrimm
Decl.â), ECF No. 3-2).

4. In addition to serving CFM, Plaintiff undertook significant efforts to serve the
Cifuentes and Wee with the Summons and Complaint, including dispatching process servers
on numerous occasions to addresses associated with Cifuentes and Wee, sending the
Summons and Complaint via Certified Mail to multiple addresses associated with Cifuentes
and Wee, contacting current and former counsel in a related criminal proceeding against
Cifuentes and Wee, and publishing notices of this action in the print and online versions of

THE STAR-LEDGER. (Grimm Decl. at J 4-10).

5. On December 29, 2016, based upon Plaintiff's efforts to serve Cifuentes and
Wee and the actual service of process upon Defendants as described in paragraphs 3-4 above,
Plaintiff moved for entry of default against Defendants (the âDefault Motionâ), (ECF No. 3).

6. On December 31, 2016, Plaintiff's process server personally served Wee with
the Summons and Complaint. (ECF No. 4-1, Ex. A).

7. On January 24, 2017, Plaintiff's process server personally served Cifuentes
with the Summons and Complaint. (ECF No. 5).

8. On February 10, 2017, the Court issued an order granting the Default Motion
as to CFM because CFM failed to respond to the Complaint within the time permitted by
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(a) and (b). (Order Granting in Part Pls. Mot. for Entry of
Default Against All Defs. (the âFebruary 10 Orderâ), ECF No. 6).

9. The February 10 Order also concluded that Plaintiffâs alternative service of
the Summons and Complaint on Cifuentes and Wee (described in paragraph 4 above) was
sufficient pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(e)(1) and New Jersey Court Rule
4:4-3(a), and resulted in Cifuentes being served with the Summons and Complaint by, at the
latest, December 8, 2016. (ECF No. 6 at 2). The Court accordingly placed Cifuentes in
default for failing to respond to the Complaint within the time allowed by Federal Rule of
Civil Procedure 12(a) and (b). (d. at 3).

10. While the February 10 Order determined that Wee had also been adequately
served with the Summons and Complaint, the Court denied without prejudice entry of default
as to her because Plaintiff voluntarily withdrew the Default Motion as to Wee on January 6,

2017. (See ECE No. 4).

11. On February 21, 2017, Plaintiff renewed the Default Motion as to Wee, on
grounds that Wee was personally served with the Summons and Complaint on December 31,
2016, and failed to respond within the time permitted by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
12(a) and (b). (ECF No. 7-1).

12. On March 17, 2017, the Court granted the Default Motion as to Wee, placing
her in default and granting Plaintiff leave to move for a default judgment as to her. (ECF No.
8). Plaintiffâs instant motion followed.

II. FINDINGS OF FACT

A. Parties

13. Plaintiff CFTC is an independent federal regulatory agency charged by
Congress with the administration and enforcement of the Act and Regulations. The CFTC
maintains its principal office at 1155 21st Street N.W., Washington, D.C. 20581.

14. Defendant Cifuentes is the spouse of Wee and, along with Wee, is one of two
founders and principals of CFM. During the Relevant Period Cifuentes was the Chief
Executive Officer, Member, and Managing Principal of CFM. Along with Wee, Cifuentes is
a signatory on the bank accounts and forex trading accounts used by and on behalf of CFM.
Cifuentes resides in West New York, New Jersey. Cifuentes has never been registered in any
capacity with the Commission.

15. Defendant Wee is the spouse of Cifuentes and, along with Cifuentes, is one of
two founders and principals of CFM. During the Relevant Period Wee was the Head of
Trading and Risk Management and the Managing Principal of CFM. Along with Cifuentes,

Wee is a signatory on the bank accounts and forex trading accounts used by and on behalf of
eo

to â

i

z
"ey,
a
-
â_

CFM. Wee resides in West New York, New Jersey. Wee has never been registered in any
capacity with the Commission.

16. Defendant Cifuentes Fund Management, LLC is a Delaware limited liability
company organized on June 11, 2013. CEM lists its principal place of business as New
York, New York. CFM is the alter ego of Cifuentes and Wee. During the Relevant Period
Cifuentes and Wee were the sole managers of CFM, Cifuentes and Wee were the only
principals and employees of CFM, Cifuentes and Wee comingled their personal funds with
the funds of CFM, and CFM held itself out as the âDBAâ (doing business as) entity of
Cifuentes and Wee. CFM has never been registered in any capacity with the Commission.

B. The Fraudulent Scheme

17. During the Relevant Period Cifuentes and Wee, individually and on behalf of
CFM, devised a sham forex pool in order to finance their lavish lifestyles with approximately
$590,000 they misappropriated from over 24 members of the public (âpool participantsââ).
To execute their scheme, Cifuentes and Wee knowingly made material misrepresentations
and omissions about their forex trading abilities, strategy, and returns to persuade pool
participants to transfer funds to Defendants. To prevent their fraud from being uncovered,
Cifuentes and Wee fabricated documents, made false statements, and diverted a portion of
pool participantsâ deposits to other victims as âdividendsâ in the manner of a âPonziâ
scheme.

18. In or around April 2013, to advance their fraudulent scheme, Cifuentes and
Wee established a practice, or demonstration, forex trading account with GFT Global

Markets UK Ltd. (the âDemo Accountâ). Fictitious âtradesâ placed in the Demo Account
eo

to â
feo
ne
i
&

z
"ey,
a
-
â_

were for demonstration purposes only, posed no risk of loss, and did not involve the actual
purchase or sale of forex contracts.

19. Between at least May and June 2014, Cifuentes and Wee lured pool
participants to deposit funds with Defendants by selecting fictitious, profitable forex trades
from the Demo Account and falsely representing these risk-free trades to be Defendantsâ
actual forex trades. Cifuentes and Wee did not disclose to pool participants that the posted
trades were fictitious, or that the Demo Account actually suffered net âlossesâ exceeding $5
million during the Relevant Period.

20. On or about May 1, 2013, Cifuentes and Wee registered the internet domain
name www.cifuentesfund.com, which they used to host a public website that they at all times
managed and controlled (the âCFM Websiteâ). Cifuentes and Wee used the CFM Website to
make numerous fraudulent statements to pool participants, including that deposits into the
CFM pool were traded by âreputable and financially strong Futures & Commodities
Merchants who are registered and regulated internationally,â that Defendants used
âalgorithmic tradingâ strategies to trade pool funds, that customersâ deposits were âFDIC
Insured,â and that CFM âFX Certificate[s] of Depositâ yielded âguaranteedâ profits of 60%
or 120% upon expiration. Cifuentes and Wee knowingly made these false and fraudulent
statements for the purpose of inducing pool participants to transfer funds to Defendants.

21. At the direction of Cifuentes and Wee, pool participants entered into
Subscription Agreements with âAlcibiades Cifuentes and/or [sic] Jennifer Wee Cifuentes
DBA Cifuentes Fund Management, LLC.â The Subscription Agreements provided that

Defendants would transfer âsecuritiesâ reflecting a âlimited partnership interestâ to a pool
eo

s
to â
feo
a
&

we
Zz

"ey,

â

participant in exchange for the pool participantâs transfer of funds to Defendants. The
Subscription Agreements provided that each pool participant would receive, on a quarterly
basis, monthly dividends âguaranteed to be no less thanâ 10 percent of the pool participantâs
principal deposits.

22. At the direction of Cifuentes and Wee, pool participants transferred funds via
wire and check payments to bank accounts controlled by Defendants. Once funds were
deposited into Defendantsâ bank accounts, Cifuentes and Wee misappropriated all or most of
pool participantsâ funds â sometimes by transfers the very day they cleared Defendantsâ bank
accounts â to finance Cifuentesâs and Weeâs lifestyles. Among other fraudulent
expenditures, Cifuentes and Wee spent pool participantsâ funds on luxury vehicles, jewelry,
and clothing.

23. Throughout the Relevant Period, Cifuentes and Wee falsely and fraudulently
represented to pool participants that their funds were used to trade or invest in forex contracts
and that money deposited with Defendants was safe, insured, and subject to rigorous risk-
management procedures. At no point did Cifuentes or Wee disclose to pool participants that
they were misappropriating pool participantsâ funds.

24. Cifuentes and Wee fabricated account statements that falsely represented to
pool participants that their funds were generating significant returns. The fabricated account
statements did not disclose that Cifuentes and Wee had stolen all of pool participantsâ funds.

25. To prevent their fraud from being uncovered, Cifuentes and Wee diverted
pool participantsâ deposits to other victims as âdividendsâ in the manner of a âPonziâ

scheme.
26. Cifuentes and Wee also made false statements to pool participants via face-to-

face meetings, e-mail, and telephone, including by blaming delayed âdividendâ payments on
fictitious international âbankersâ and financial institutions.

27. In total, Defendants fraudulently solicited approximately $590,000 from at
least 24 pool participants. Defendants passed $132,880 of the funds they stole from some
pool participants to other pool participants through âPonziââ-like payments, and
misappropriated the remaining $457,120 for themselves. (Decl. of Patricia Gomersall
(âGomersall Decl.ââ), ECF No. 10-4 {J 27, 36 & Ex. I).

III. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
A. Default Judgment Is Warranted Against Cifuentes, Wee, and CFM

28. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 55(b) and New Jersey Court Rule 4:43-2
authorizes litigants to seek, and the Court to enter, default judgment against a party who has
failed to plead or otherwise defend an action. Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(b); N.J. Ct. R. 4:43-2.

29. Three factors determine whether default judgment may be entered: whether
(1) defendants have been served with the summons and complaint and the court possesses
jurisdiction; (2) the unchallenged facts of the complaint adequately allege a cause of action;
and (3) entry of default judgment is proper, based upon certain issues within the Courtâs
discretion. See Dellecese v. Assigned Credit Solutions, Inc., 2017 WL 957848, at *2 (D.N.J.
Mar. 10, 2017) (quoting Teamsters Health & Welfare Fund of Phila. v. Dubin Paper Co.,
2012 WL 3018062, at *2 (D.N.J. July 24, 2012)).

30. Where the first two factors above have been satisfied, courts in the Third

Circuit consider three discretionary issues in determining whether entry of default judgment
eo

x
to â
feo
ne
i
&

z
"ey,
a
-
â_

is proper: (1) the prejudice to plaintiff if default judgment is denied; (2) whether defendants
have a meritorious defense to the action; and (3) whether defendants are culpable for their
default. See U.S. v. $487,825.00 in U.S. Currency, 484 F.3d 662, 664 (3d Cir. 2007); see
also CDK Glob., LLC v. Midwest Truck Sales, Inc., 2017 WL 838800, at *2 (D.N.J. Mar. 3,
2017).

31. As discussed below, all of the factors above support entry of default judgment
against Defendants.

B. Jurisdiction and Venue

32. This Court possesses jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 6c(a) of
the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(a) (2012), which authorizes the CFTC to seek injunctive and other
relief in a United States district court against any person whenever it shall appear to the
CFTC that such person has engaged in any act or practice that violates the Act or
Regulations. The Court possesses jurisdiction over Cifuentes and Wee because they reside in
this District and committed the violations of the Act and Regulations alleged in the
Complaint within this District, and over CFM because it is the alter ego of Cifuentes and
Wee, it conducted business in this District, and it maintained addresses in this District.

33. Venue properly lies with this Court pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act,

7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(e) (2012), because the acts and practices in violation of the Act and
Regulations occurred within this District.
C. The Complaint Has Adequately Pled All Four Causes of Action
34. In considering a motion for default judgment, the Court takes ââthe factual

allegations of the complaint, except those relating to the amount of damages . . . as true.âââ

Teamsters Pension Fund of Phila. & Vicinity v. Am. Helper, Inc., 2011 WL 4729023, at *2
(D.N.J. Oct. 5, 2011) (quoting DIRECTV, Inc. v. Pepe, 431 F.3d 162, 165 n.6 (3d Cir. 2005)).
As described below, the Complaint has adequately pled all four asserted causes of action.

i. Cifuentes and Wee Violated Section 4b(a)(2)(A)-(C) of the Act and Regulation
5.2(b) (Fraud in Connection with Forex Transactions)

35. Section 4b(a)(2)(A) and (C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6b(a)(2)(A), (C) (2012),
prohibits any person or entity from cheating, defrauding, or misleading another person in
connection with off-exchange commodity futures or forex contracts. Section 4b(a)(2)(A)-(C)
of the Act applies to forex transactions as if they were futures contracts. Section
2(c)(2)(C)(iv) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(c)(2)(C)iv) (2012).

36. Plaintiff may establish a violation of Section 4b(a)(1)(A) and (C) of the Act
by showing that Defendants made a material misrepresentation, misleading statement, or
deceptive omission with scienter. CFTC v. Rosenberg, 85 F. Supp. 2d 424, 447 (D.N.J.
2000). Scienter âis an âintent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud,â and it may be shown either
by conscious behavior or recklessness.â CFTC vy. Equity Fin. Grp. LLC, 572 F.3d 150, 159
(3d Cir. 2009) (quoting Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U.S. 185, 193 (1976)). A statement

eee

or Omission is material if âââa reasonable investor would consider it important in deciding
whether to make an investment.â Rosenberg, 85 F. Supp. 2d at 447 (quoting Saxe v. E.F.
Hutton & Co., Inc., 789 F.2d 105, 109 (2d Cir. 1986)). Account balances and profits
âconstitute information that a reasonable investor would consider important in trading
commodity futures... .â Id. at 448.

37. Section 4b(a)(2)(B) of the Act prohibits the creation of false reports or

statements in connection with off-exchange futures or forex contracts. âDelivering, or

-10-
causing the delivery of, false account statements to customers relating to forex trades...
constitutes a violation of Section 4b(a)(2)(B) of the Act.â CFTC vy. Total Call Grp., 2012
WL 1642196, at *7 (E.D. Tex. Mar. 30, 2012).

38. Regulation 5.2(b) makes it unlawful, in connection with an off-exchange retail
forex transaction, to use the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce to
(1) cheat or defraud or attempt to cheat or defraud any person; (2) willfully make a false
report or statement; or (3) willfully deceive any person by any means.

39. The facts of the Complaint, taken as true for purposes of the instant motion,
adequately allege that Cifuentes and Wee, through CFM, acted with scienter by intentionally
making material misrepresentations and omissions to pool participants to entice them to
deposit funds with Defendants, and then misappropriated those funds for their own benefit.

AO. To conceal their fraud, Defendants created and sent to pool participants via e-
mail and otherwise fabricated account and performance statements that falsely reflected
massive trading gains. (See Gomersall Decl. J 41-42 & Ex. K (fabricated account
statements)). Contrary to Defendantsâ misrepresentations, little if any trading occurred, no
profits were made, and Defendants misappropriated pool participantsâ funds. (See Gomersall
Decl. {| 16-19, 28-42).

41. The allegations of the Complaint adequately state claims against Defendants
for violating Section 4b(a)(2)(A)-(C) of the Act and Regulation 5.2(b). See CFTC v. Siegel,
2014 WL 7404537, at *6 (D.N.J. Dec. 30, 2014) (entering default judgment for CFTC
because â[c]ourts have held that misappropriation of pool participant fundsâ violates Section

4b of the Act); see also Total Call Grp., 2012 WL 1642196, at *7 (delivery of false forex

-ll-
Case 2:16-cv-06167-ES-JAD Document 12 Filed 04/20/18 Page 12 of 26 PagelD: 258

trading account statements violates Section 4b(a)(2)(B) of the Act); CFTC v. Yu, 2012 WL
3283430, at *5 (N.D. Cal. Aug, 10, 2012) (use of the telephone and e-mail to commit forex
fraud violates Regulation 5.2(b)).

ii. CFM Violated Section 40(1)(A) and (B) of the Act and Regulation 4.41(a)
(Fraud by a Commodity Pool Operator)

42. Section 40(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 60(1) (2012), makes it unlawful for a
commodity pool operator (âCPOââ) to use any means or instrumentality of interest commerce
to (A) employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud a pool participant; or (B) engage in a
transaction, practice, or course of business that operates as a fraud or deceit upon a pool
participant.

43, Regulation 5.4, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 5.4 (2016), states that Part 4 of the Regulations,
17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 4.1 â 4.41 (2016), applies to any person required to register as a CPO pursuant
to Part 5 of the Regulations related to off-exchange forex transactions, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 5.1 -
5.25 (2016).

44, Regulation 4.41(a), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 4.41(a) (2016), makes it unlawful for any
CPO, or any principal of a CPO, to publish or distribute materials that (1) employ any device,
scheme, or artifice to defraud a pool participant; or (2) involve any transaction, practice, or
course of business which operates as a fraud or deceit upon a pool participant.

45. During the Relevant Period CFM, through Cifuentes and Wee, acted as a CPO
by soliciting, accepting, or receiving funds from the public while engaged in a business that
is of the nature of an investment trust, syndicate, or similar form of enterprise, for the
purpose of, among other things, trading in off-exchange leveraged or margined forex

contracts. Cifuentes and Wee acted as associated persons of a CPO because they were

_12-
Case 2:16-cv-06167-ES-JAD Document 12 Filed 04/20/18 Page 13 of 26 PagelD: 259

partners, officers, employees, consultants, or agents of a CPO in a capacity that involved the
solicitation of funds, securities, or property for participation in a commodity pool.

46. During the Relevant Period CFM, through Cifuentes and Wee, violated
Section 40(1)(A) and (B) of the Act and Regulation 4.41(a) by making material
misrepresentations and omissions about the CFM pool to pool participants, by fabricating
account statements, and by misappropriating pool participantsâ funds.

47. The Complaint allegations that support Plaintiffâs forex fraud claims under
Section 4b(a)(2)(A)-(C) of the Act also support Plaintiffâs Section 40(1)(A) and (B) fraud
claims. See CFTC v. Driver, 877 F. Supp. 2d 968, 978 (C.D. Cal. 2012), aff'd 585 Fed.
Appâx 366 (9th Cir. 2014) (âThe same intentional or reckless misappropriations,
misrepresentations, and omissions of material fact violative of section 4b of the Act... also
violate section 40(1)(A)-(B) of the Act.ââ)

iii. CFM Violated Sections 2(c)(2)(iii)(D(cc) and 4m(1) of the Act and

Regulation 5.3(a)(2)(i) (Failure to Register as a Commodity Pool
Operator)

A8. Section 2(c)(2)(C)Gi)()(cc) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(c)2)(C)~ii) (cc)
(2012), makes it unlawful for any person, unless registered with the Commission, to operate
or solicit funds for any pooled investment vehicle that is not an eligible contract participant
(âECPââ) in connection with leveraged or margined forex transactions entered into with a
person who is not described in Section 2(c)(2)(B)@)(D(aa) â (ff) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.

Â§ 2(c)(2)(B)@)CD (aa) â (ff) (2012).
49. At no time during the Relevant Period did CFM qualify as an ECP. See

Section 1a(18) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1a(18) (2012).

50. Section 4m(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6m(1) (2012), prohibits an unregistered
CPO from using any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce in connection with its
business as a CPO. Regulation 5.3(a)(2)q), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 5.3(a)(2)G) (2016), requires forex
CPOs to register with the Commission.

51. During the Relevant Period CFM, through Cifuentes and Wee, violated
Sections 2(c)(2)(C)(ii1)(1)(cc) and 4m(1) of the Act and Regulation 5.3(a)(2)(i) by soliciting
funds for a pooled vehicle that transacted in off-exchange leveraged or margined retail forex
transactions without first registering with the Commission as a CPO.

iv. Cifuentes and Wee Violated Section 4k(2) of the Act and Regulations 3.12
and 5.3(a)(2)(ii) (Failure to Register as Associated Persons of a
Commodity Pool Operator)

52. Section 4k(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6k(2) (2012), and Regulation
5.3(a)(2)(Gi), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 5.3(a)(2)(i1) (2016), require any person associated with a CPO as an
officer, employee, or agent, in any capacity involving the solicitation of funds for
participation in a commodity pool, including a commodity pool that trades in retail forex
transactions, to register with the Commission. Regulation 3.12, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 3.12 (2016),
prohibits any person from acting as an associated person of a CPO unless registered as such
with the Commission.

53. During the Relevant Period Cifuentes and Wee violated Section 4k(2) of the
Act and Regulations 3.12 and 5.3(a)(2)(i1) by acting as officers and employees of, and by
soliciting funds for, the CFM pool without being registered with the Commission as
associated persons of a CPO. (See Gomersall Decl. J 8 & Ex. B (NFA certificates of non-

registration)).

vy. CFM is Liable for the Conduct of Cifuentes and Wee

54. Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(a)(1)(B) (2012), and Regulation
1.2, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.2 (2016), impose liability on a business association for the acts and
omissions of its agents made within the scope of their employment or office. CFM is liable
for Cifuentesâs and Weeâs violations of the Act and Regulations alleged in the Complaint
because Cifuentes and Wee were at all relevant times acting as agents of CFM.

Vi. Cifuentes and Wee are Liable for CFMâs Conduct

55. Section 13(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13c(b) (2012), imposes liability on
controlling persons for the acts and omissions of the entity those persons control (â[a]ny
person who, directly or indirectly, controls any person who has violated any provision of this
Act ... may be held liable for such violation . . . to the same extent as such controlled person.
In such action, the Commission has the burden of proving that the controlling person did not
act in good faith or knowingly induced, directly or indirectly, the acts or acts constituting the
violation.â) Cifuentes and Wee are liable for CFMâs conduct because CFM is an alter ego of
Cifuentes and Wee, who were the only officers of CFM and at all times directed and
controlled CFM.

56. or knowingly induced, directly or indirectly, the acts or acts constituting the
violation.ââ)

D. Default Judgment is Proper
57. The Court, in its sound discretion, has determined that default judgment is

proper and should be entered against Defendants.

_15-
2.l6-cv-O61607-ES-JAD Document i2 Fied O4/20/18 Page 16 of 26 PageiD: 262
58. Default judgment is proper because it will prevent further prejudice to

Plaintiff. As a result of Defendantsâ failure to answer the Complaint, Plaintiff âhas incurred
additional costs, has been unable to move forward with the case, and has been delayed in
receiving relief.â Electromagnetic Techs. Indus., Inc. vy. CCOM, 2015 WL 3879691, at *2
(D.N.J. June 22, 2015) (granting motion for default judgment). Absent default judgment,
Plaintiff will continue to be prejudiced by being hindered from fulfilling its congressional
mandate of enforcing the Act. See SEC vy. Fortitude Grp., Inc., 2017 WL 818604, at *2
(W.D. Pa. Feb. 10, 2017) (granting SECâs motion for default judgment because SEC would
âbe prejudiced by its inability to effectively enforce federal securities lawsâ if motion were
denied).

59. Default judgment is proper because Defendants have no meritorious defense
to the action. By failing to respond to the action, Defendants have âput forth no evidence or
facts containing any information that could provide the basis for a meritorious defense.â
HICA Educ. Loan Corp. v. Surikov, 2015 WL 273656, at *3 (D.N.J. Jan. 22, 2015) (granting
motion for default judgment). As nothing on the face of the Complaint indicates that
Defendants have a meritorious defense, default judgment is proper. See, e.g., Interpool, Inc.
v. Four Horsemen, Inc., 2017 WL 1284766, at *4 (D.N.J. Mar. 24, 2017) (granting motion
for default judgment).

60. Default judgment is proper because Defendants are presumed to be culpable
for their failure to respond to this action. See, e.g., Electromagnetic Techs., 2015 WL

3879691, at *2 (â[W]here Defendant has failed to respond, there is a presumption of

-16-
culpability.â) Culpability is also presumed because Defendants have failed to respond
âwithout providing any reasonable explanation.â Jnterpool, 2017 WL 1284766, at *4.

61. Accordingly, the Court enters default judgment against Defendants and orders
the relief set forth below.

IV. PERMANENT INJUNCTION

62. Section 6c(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(a) (2012), authorizes the
Commission to seek, and the Court to impose, injunctive relief against any person whenever
it shall appear to the CFTC that such person has engaged in any act or practice that violates
the Act or Regulations.

63. The ââultimate testââ for entry of an injunction under the Act ââis whether the
defendantâs past conduct indicates that there is a reasonable likelihood of further violations in
the future.ââ Siegel, 2014 WL 7404537, at *9 (quoting CFTC v. Wilshire Inv. Mgmt. Corp.,
531 F.3d 1339, 1346 (11th Cir. 2008)). Future violations of the Act or Regulations âmay be
inferred, or even presumed, from past unlawful conduct, and the absence of proof to the
contrary.â CFTC vy. Am. Metals Exch. Corp., 693 F. Supp. 168, 171 (D.N.J. 1988) (citing
CFTC v. Hunt, 591 F.2d 1211, 1220 (7th Cir. 1979)).

64. The scope of injunctive relief can be tailored to meet the circumstances of the
violations shown. For example, upon the CFTCâs showing of a violation, courts have
entered permanent injunctions against future violations of the Act. See, e.g., Rosenberg, 85
F. Supp. 2d at 455 (permanently enjoining defendants âfrom future violations ofâ provisions
of the Act). Courts have also permanently enjoined defendants from registering with the

CFTC and engaging in any commodity-related activity. See, e.g., Wilshire, 531 F.3d at 1346

_17-
Case 2:16-cv-06167-ES-JAD Document 12 Filed 04/20/18 Page 18 of 26 PagelD: 264

(upholding the district courtâs permanent injunction prohibiting the defendants from
âengaging in any commodity-related activityâ).

65. As set forth above, the well-pleaded facts of the Complaint and the facts set
forth in the Declaration of Patricia Gomersall establish that Defendantsâ unlawful conduct
makes it highly likely that they will be repeat violators unless permanently restrained by this
Court.

66. As alleged, Defendants knowingly stole all of the money entrusted to them by
spending it on themselves or passing it to other victims, often within a day of the funds
clearing their accounts. Rather than admit their wrongdoing, Defendants took pains to
conceal their fraud by, among other things, fabricating documents, making false statements,
and making âPonziâ-like payments to pool participants. Injunctive relief is appropriate in
these circumstances. See Rosenberg, 85 F. Supp. 2d at 454 (granting CFTCâs motion for
permanent injunction because defendantsâ misappropriation of customer funds was
âegregiously fraudulent conductâ that made future violations of the Act likely).

67. As shown above, the well-pleaded facts set forth in the Complaint and the
Gomersall Declaration establish that:

(a) Defendants violated Sections 2(c)(2)(C)ai)(1)(cc), 4b(a)(2)(A)-(C), 4k, 4m(1),

and 40(1)(A) and (B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 2(c)(2)(C)Gi(D)(cc), 6b(a)(2)(A)-
(C), 6k, 6m(1), and 60(1)(A) and (B) (2012); and Regulations 3.12, 4.41(a),
5.2(b), and 5.3(a)(2)(), (ii), 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 3.12, 4.41(a), 5.2(b), and 5.3(a)(2)()

and (41) (2016); and

-18-
Case 2:16-cv-06167-ES-JAD Document 12 Filed 04/20/18 Page 19 of 26 PagelD: 265

(b) there is a reasonable likelihood that Defendants will continue to violate the Act
and Regulations unless permanently restrained and enjoined by this Court. The
intentional and egregious nature of Defendantsâ fraudulent conduct warrants
permanent injunctive relief, including registration and trading bans.

68. Accordingly, Defendants are permanently restrained, enjoined, and prohibited

from directly or indirectly:

(a) Engaging in conduct that violates Sections 2(c)(2)(C)a11)(1)(cc),
Ab(a)(2)(A)-(C), 4k, 4m(1), and 40(1)(A) and (B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.

Â§Â§ 2(c)(2)(C)ai)()(cc), 6b(a)(2)(A)-(C), 6k, 6m(1), and 60(1)(A) and (B) (2012);

and Regulations 3.12, 4.41(a), 5.2(b), and 5.3(a)(2)(i) and (11), 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 3.12,

4.41(a), 5.2(b), and 5.3(a)(2)() and (11) (2016);

(a) trading on or subject to the rules of any registered entity (as that term
is defined in Section la(40) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ la(40) (2012));

(b) entering into any transaction involving âcommodity interestsâ (as that
term is defined in Regulation 1.3(yy), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.3(yy) (2014)) for their own
personal account or for any account in which they have a direct or indirect interest;

(c) having any commodity interests traded on their behalf;

(d) controlling or directing trading for or on behalf of any other person or
entity, whether by power of attorney or otherwise, in any account involving
commodity interests;

(e) soliciting, receiving, or accepting any funds from any person for the

purpose of purchasing or selling any commodity interests;

-19-
2:160-cv-OG107-ES-JAD Document 12 led O4/2O/18 Page 20 of 26 PageiD: 266
(f) applying for registration or claiming exemption from registration with

the Commission in any capacity, and engaging in any activity requiring registration or
exemption from registration with the Commission, except as provided for in
Regulation 4.14(a)(9), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 4.14(a)(9) (2016);

(g) acting as a principal (as that term is defined in Regulation 3.1(a), 17
C.F.R. Â§ 3.1(a) (2016)), agent, or any other officer or employee of any person
registered, exempted from registration, or required to be registered with the
Commission, except as provided for in Regulation 4.14(a)(9), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 4.14(a)(9)
(2016);

(h) Engaging in any business activities related to commodity interests.

V. RESTITUTION AND CIVIL MONETARY PENALTY

A. Restitution

69. Section 6c(d)(3)(A) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(d)(3)(A) (2012), authorizes
the Commission to seek, and the Court to impose, equitable remedies for violations of the
Act, including ârestitution to persons who have sustained losses proximately caused by such
violation (in the amount of such losses). Courts calculate restitution âas the difference
between what Defendants obtained and the amount customers have already received back.â
CFTC vy. Ross, 2014 WL 6704572, at *3 (N.D. Ill. Nov. 26, 2014). See also CFTC v. Leben,
2016 WL 7354359, at *9 (D.S.C. Aug. 5, 2016) (ârestitution is determined by calculating the
total amount of funds solicited from victims of the fraud by a defendant, less any funds
returned to the victims by defendant.ââ)

70. Defendantsâ illegal conduct caused at least 24 pool participants to incur net

losses totaling $457,120, which reflects the total funds Defendants fraudulently solicited
($590,000) minus the funds they stole from some pool participants and passed to other pool
participants in the form of âPonziâ-like payments ($132,880). (See Gomersall Decl. {J 27,
36 & Ex. I).

71. Accordingly, Defendants are ordered to pay, on a joint and several basis,
restitution in the amount of $457,120 (four hundred fifty-seven thousand, one hundred
twenty dollars), plus post-judgment interest thereon (the âRestitution Obligationâ). Post-
judgment interest shall accrue beginning on the date of entry of this Order and shall be
determined pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1961 (2012).

72. The Court appoints the National Futures Association (âNFAâ) as Monitor to
distribute payments made against the Restitution Obligation to Defendantsâ pool participants.
The Monitor shall collect restitution payments from Defendants and make distributions as set
forth below. Because the Monitor is acting as an officer of this Court in performing these
services, NFA shall not be liable for any action or inaction arising from NFAâs appointment
as Monitor, other than actions involving fraud.

73. Defendants shall make Restitution Obligation payments under this Order to
the Monitor in the name âCifuentes/Wee Restitution Fundâ and shall send such payments by
electronic funds transfer, or by U.S. postal money order, certified check, bank cashierâs
check, or bank money order, to the Office of Administration, National Futures Association,
300 South Riverside Plaza, Suite 1800, Chicago, Illinois 60606, accompanied by a cover
letter identifying Defendants and the name and docket number of this proceeding.

Defendants shall simultaneously transmit copies of the cover letter and the form of payment

to the Chief Financial Officer, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Three Lafayette
Centre, 1155 21st Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20581.

74. The Monitor shall oversee the Restitution Obligation and shall have the
discretion to determine the manner of distribution of such funds in an equitable fashion to
Defendantsâ pool participants identified by the CFTC, or may defer distribution until such
time as the Monitor deems appropriate. In the event that the amount of Restitution
Obligation payments to the Monitor are of a de minimis nature such that the Monitor
determines that the administrative cost of making a distribution to eligible pool participants is
impractical, the Monitor may, in its discretion, treat such restitution payments as civil
monetary penalty payments, which the Monitor shall forward to the CFTC pursuant to the
instructions for civil monetary penalty payments set forth below.

75. Defendants shall cooperate with the Monitor as appropriate to provide such
information as the Monitor deems necessary and appropriate to identify Defendantsâ pool
participants to whom the Monitor, in its sole discretion, may determine to include in any plan
for distribution of any Restitution Obligation payments. Defendants shall execute any
documents necessary to release funds that they hold in any repository, bank, investment, or
other financial institution, wherever located, in order to make partial or total payment toward
the Restitution Obligation.

76. The Monitor shall provide the CFTC at the beginning of each calendar year
with a report detailing the disbursement of funds to Defendantsâ pool participants during the
previous year. The Monitor shall transmit this report accompanied by a cover letter

identifying the name and docket number of this proceeding to the Chief Financial Officer,

Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street, N.W.,

77. The amounts payable to each pool participant shall not limit the ability of any
pool participant to prove that a greater amount is owed from Defendants or any other person
or entity, and nothing herein shall be construed in any way to limit or abridge the rights of
any pool participant that exist under state or common law.

78. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 71, each pool participant of
Defendants who suffered a loss is explicitly made an intended third-party beneficiary of this
Order and may seek to enforce this Order to obtain satisfaction of any portion of the
Restitution Obligation that has not been paid by Defendants, to ensure continued compliance
with any provision of this Order, and to hold Defendants in contempt for any violations of
any provision of this Order.

79. To the extent that any funds accrue to the U.S. Treasury for satisfaction of the
Restitution Obligation, such funds shall be transferred to the Monitor for disbursement in
accordance with the procedures set forth above.

B. Civil Monetary Penalty

80. Section 6c(d)(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(d)C1) (2012), and Regulation
143.8(a)(4)G1)(B), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 143.8(a)(4)(1)(B) (2016), authorize the Commission to seek,
and the Court to impose, a civil monetary penalty of triple Defendantsâ monetary gain from
each violation of the Act or Regulations, or $167,728 per violation, whichever is greater.

81. The Court considers numerous factors in determining an appropriate civil

monetary penalty under the Act, including (1) whether Defendantsâ illegal acts violated core

23 -
provisions of the Act; (2) whether Defendants acted with scienter; (3) the consequences
resulting from Defendantsâ violations; (4) the financial benefits to Defendants; and (4) the
harm to Defendantsâ customers. See Wilshire, 531 F.3d at 1346; see also CFTC v. Yorkshire
Grp., Inc., 2016 WL 8256380, at *6 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 19, 2016).

82. Courts routinely award significant civil monetary penalties in cases involving
fraud. See, e.g., CFTC v. Onsa, 2014 WL 2960345, at *1 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 20, 2014) (entering
civil monetary penalty of triple defendantsâ gain in commodity pool fraud case due to âthe
egregiousness of the defendantsâ intentional conductâ); see also CFTC v. SK Madison
Commodities, LLC, 2014 WL 3887755, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. June 9, 2014) (entering default
judgment and ordering a civil monetary penalty of âtriple the amount misappropriatedâ
where defendants âcommitted repeated violations of core provisions of the[Act] and
Regulations.â); CFTC v. Rolando, 589 F. Supp. 2d 159, 174 (D. Conn. 2008) (âobtaining
customer funds and then hiding [defendantâs] true conduct from his customers were serious
violations of the Act . . .that strike at the very core of the Act's regulatory system,â requiring
ââa substantial civil monetary penalty.ââ)

83. Defendantsâ conduct warrants the imposition of a significant monetary
penalty. Cifuentes and Wee, through CEM, committed repeated violations of the core
antifraud provisions of the Act and Regulations that caused significant monetary losses to
pool participants. In fraudulently soliciting approximately $590,000 in pool participantsâ
funds, Cifuentes and Wee spent hundreds of thousands of dollars of their victimsâ money on
personal expenses such luxury vehicles, jewelry, and clothing. (See Gomersall Decl. J 28-

39 & Exs. I, J).

24 -
2 io-cv-O6167-ES-JAD Document i2 Filed O4/20/18 Page 25 of 26 PageiD
84. Given Defendantsâ intentional and egregious conduct, the Court believes that

a civil monetary penalty reflecting triple the funds Defendants fraudulently misappropriated
($590,000) is proper to deter future fraudulent schemes in violation of the Act and
Regulations. This penalty is authorized by Section 6c(d)(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-
1(d)(1) (2012), and Regulation 143.8(a)(4)Gi)(B), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 143.8(a)(4)Gi)(B) (2016).

85. Accordingly, Defendants are ordered to pay, on a joint and several basis, a
civil monetary penalty in the amount of $1,770,000 (one million, seven hundred seventy
thousand dollars), plus post-judgment interest thereon (âCMP Obligationâ). Post-judgment
interest shall accrue beginning on the date of entry of this Order and shall be determined
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1961 (2012).

86. Defendants shall pay the CMP Obligation by electronic funds transfer, U.S.
postal money order, certified check, bank cashierâs check, or bank money order. If payment
is to be made other than by electronic funds transfer, then the payment shall be made payable
to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and sent to the address below:

proceeding. Defendants shall simultaneously transmit copies of the cover letter and the form

VI. MISCELLANOUS PROVISIONS

87. Partial Satisfaction: Acceptance by the CFTC or the Monitor of any partial
payment of the Restitution Obligation or the CMP Obligation shall not be deemed a waiver
of Defendantsâ obligation to make further payments pursuant to this Order, or a waiver of the
CFTCâs right to seek to compel payment of any remaining balance.

88.  Injunctive and Equitable Relief Provisions: The injunctive and equitable
relief provisions of this Order shall be binding upon Defendants, upon any person under their
authority or control, and upon any person who receives actual notice of this Order, by personal
service, e-mail, facsimile or otherwise insofar as he or she is acting in active concert or
participation with Defendants.

89. Continuing Jurisdiction of this Court: This Court shall retain jurisdiction of
this action to ensure compliance with this Order and for all other purposes related to this
action, including any motion by Defendants to modify, or for relief from, the terms of this
Order.
