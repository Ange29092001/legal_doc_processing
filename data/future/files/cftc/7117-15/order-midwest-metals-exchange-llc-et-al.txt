ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTIONS 6(c) AND 6(d) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, AS AMENDED,
MAKING FINDINGS AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

I.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (ââCommissionâ or âCFTCâ) has reason to
believe that from in or about July 16, 2011 through March 2013 (the ârelevant periodâ), Midwest
Metals Exchange, LLC (âMidwestâ) and its controlling person, Brian Steven Ekasala
(âEkasalaâ) (collectively âRespondentsâ), violated Section 4(a) of the Commodity Exchange Act
(âActâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6(a) (2012). Therefore, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the
public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted to determine
whether Respondents engaged in violations set forth herein, and to determine whether any order
should be issued imposing remedial sanctions.

I.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Respondents have
submitted an Offer of Settlement (âOfferâ), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Without admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, Respondents consent to
the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 6(c) and 6(d) of the
Commodity Exchange Act, Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (âOrderâ) and
acknowledge service of this Order.â

 

' Respondents consent to the entry of this Order and to the use of these findings in this

proceeding and in any other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission
is a party; provided, however, that Respondents do not consent to the use of the Offer, or the
findings or conclusions in this Order consented to in the Offer, as the sole basis for any other
proceeding brought by the Commission, other than in a proceeding in bankruptcy or to enforce
(Footnote continued)

 
III,
The Commission finds the following:
A, SUMMARY

During the relevant period, Respondents violated Section 4(a) of the Act by offering to
enter into, entering into, confirming the execution of, and conducting an office and business in
the United States for the purpose of soliciting, accepting orders for, and otherwise dealing in
illegal, off-exchange retail commodity transactions. Specifically, the transactions were financed
precious metals transactions with individual investors. Ekasala is directly liable for such
violations, and he is also liable as the controlling person of Midwest. For these transactions,
Midwest received commissions and fees totaling $322,852.71.

B. RESPONDENTS

Midwest Metals Exchange, LLC is a Florida limited liability company formed in
January 2010 and it has been inactive since September 2014. Its principal place of business was
Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Midwest was a telemarketing firm that solicited retail customers to
invest in financed precious metals transactions. Midwest has never been registered with the
Commission in any capacity. |

Brian Steven Ekasala is a resident of Lake Worth, Florida, Ekasala was the owner,
operator, and controlling person of Midwest. Ekasala was intermittently registered with the
Commission as an associated person between 1992 and 2008.

Cc, OTHER RELEVANT ENTITY

Hunter Wise Commodities, LLC (âHunter Wiseâ) was formed as a California limited
liability company in July 2007 but was converted to a Nevada limited liability company in
October 2010. It held itself out on its website as âa physical commodity trading company,
wholesaler, market maker, back-office support provider, and finance company.â During the
relevant period, Hunter Wise executed and confirmed the execution of retail commodity
transactions involving gold, silver, platinum, palladium, and copper throughout the United States
using a network of telemarketing solicitors, such as Midwest, that it referred to as âdealers.â

D. FACTS

During the relevant period, Midwest was a telemarketing firm that solicited retail
customers to engage in financed precious metals transactions, Although Midwest also offered
precious metals and coins on a fully paid basis, the vast majority of its business was in financed

 

the terms of this Order. Nor do Respondents consent to the use of the Offer or this Order, or the
findings or conclusions in this Order consented to in the Offer, by any other party in any other
proceeding.

 
precious metals transactions. This Order relates to the financed precious metals transactions
executed through Hunter Wise.

Midwest telemarketers conducted nearly all of their solicitations by telephone. Ekasala,
the controlling person of Midwest, directly solicited customers of his own and supervised other
telemarketers involved in customer solicitations, When soliciting customers for financed
precious metals transactions executed through Hunter Wise, Ekasala and the other Midwest
telemarketers represented that to purchase a specific quantity of metal, the customer was required to
deposit thirty percent of the total metal value. Midwest represented that the customer would
receive a loan for the remaining percentage (e.g., 70%), and that the customer would have to pay
a finance charge on the loan. In addition, for each metal purchase, Midwest charged customers a
sales commission that ranged as high as thirty percent on the total metal value and a mark-up
on the spot price of the subject metal.

If the customer agreed to the transaction, Midwest confirmed the transaction and
directed the customer to send Midwest a lump sum payment, which represented the deposit on
the value of the total metal purchased, the commission amount, and the mark-up amount.

Upon receipt of those funds, Midwest sent the funds in their entirety to Hunter Wise, Hunter
Wise then remitted the commission and fees due back to Midwest. During the relevant period,
Midwest received $322,852.71 in commissions and fees for the retail financed precious metals
transactions the firm executed through Hunter Wise.

Neither Midwest nor Hunter Wise bought, sold, loaned, stored, or transferred any
physical metals for these financed precious metals transactions. Likewise, neither Midwest,
nor Hunter Wise actually delivered any precious metals to any customers. Instead, Hunter
Wise managed exposure on these transactions using derivatives in margin trading accounts
with several entities. CFTC v. Hunter Wise Commodities, LLC, No, 12-81311-CIV, 749 F.3d

IV.
LEGAL DISCUSSION
A, Relevant Statutory Background

Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010,
Public Law 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376 (2010) ("the Dodd-Frank Act") amended the Commodity
Exchange Act to add, among other things, new authority over certain leveraged, margined, or
financed retail commodity transactions, including authority to prohibit fraud in connection with
such transactions.

Section 742(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act added Section 2(c)(2)(D) to the Act.â Section
2(c)(2)(D) broadly applies to any agreement, contract, or transaction in any commodity that is
entered into with, or offered to (even if not entered into with), a non-eligible contract

 

* Section 2(c)(2)(D) of the Act became effective July 16, 2011.

 
participant ("non-ECP") or non-eligible commercial entity on a leveraged or margined basis,
or financed by the offeror, the counterparty, or a person acting in concert with the offeror or
counterparty on a similar basis. 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(c)(2)(D)(i). Section 2(c)(2)(D) further provides
that such an agreement, contract, or transaction shall be subject to Sections 4(a), 4(b), and 4b
of the Act "as if the agreement, contract, or transaction was a contract of sale of a commodity
for future delivery.â 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(c)2)(D)Giii).

Section 2(c)(2)(D)(it) of the Act, excepts certain transactions from Section 2(c)(2)(D).
Section 2(c)(2)(D)qi)(I])(aa) excepts a contract of sale that "results in actual delivery within
28 days or such other longer period as the Commission may determine by rule or regulation
based upon the typical commercial practice in cash or spot markets for the commodity
involved."* Section 2(c)(2)(D)(ii)(III)(bb) excepts a contract of sale that creates an
enforceable obligation to deliver between a seller and a buyer that have the ability to deliver
and accept delivery, respectively, in connection with the line of business of the seller and
buyer.

The Commission has stated that the determination of whether "actual delivery" has
occurred within the meaning of Section 2(c)(2)(D)(ii)(I1D(aa) requires a consideration of
evidence beyond the four corners of the contract documents. This interpretation of the
statutory language is based on Congress's use of the word "actual" to modify "delivery" and
on the legislative history of Section 2(c)(2)(D)Gi)(ID) (aa). Consistent with this interpretation,
in determining whether actual delivery has occurred within 28 days, the Commission employs
a functional approach and examines how the agreement, contract, or transaction is marketed,
managed, and performed, instead of relying solely on language used by the parties in the
agreement, contract, or transaction.â Unless the Commission provides otherwise, the 28 days
for actual delivery is 28 days from the date the agreement, contract, or transaction is confirmed
to the buyer or seller, typically, a retail customer.

 

* As is relevant to this matter, Section 1a(18)(xi) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ La(18)(xi) (2012),
defines an individual eligible contract participant as a person who has amounts invested on a
discretionary basis, the aggregate of which is in excess of $10,000,000, or which is in excess
of $5,000,000 and who enters into the agreement, contract, or transaction in order to manage
the risk associated with an asset owned or liability incurred, or reasonably likely to be owned
or incurred, by the individual.

* The Commission has not adopted any regulations permitting a longer actual delivery period
for any commodity pursuant to Section 2(c)(2)(D)Gi)(1D(aa) of the Act. Accordingly, the 28
day actual delivery period set forth in this provision remains applicable to all commodities.

> See Retail Commodity Transactions Under Commodity Exchange Act, 76 Fed, Reg. 77,670
(Dec. 14, 2011)

 
Other than these exceptions, Congress did not express any intent to limit the reach of
Section 2(c)(2)(D). Rather, in enacting the statute Congress expressed its intent that Section
2(c)(2)(D) should be applicable to a broad range of agreements, contracts, and transactions.

Section 2(c)(2)(D) of the Act applies to all agreements, contracts, and transactions
entered into with, or offered to, non-ECPs on a leveraged or margined basis, or financed by
the offeror, the counterparty, or a person acting in concert with the offeror or counterparty on a
similar basis, as those terms are commonly used in the industry,

B. The Commission's Jurisdiction

Respondents offered precious metals transactions to, and entered into such transactions
with, persons who were not eligible contract participants or eligible commercial entities.
Generally, Respondents' customers were unsophisticated, individual investors who did not
meet the $10 million discretionary investment threshold to be considered ECPs. Moreover,
Respondents offered and entered into such transactions on a margined or leveraged basis, or
financed by Midwest or Hunter Wise, which acted in concert with Respondents. Respondentsâ
retail financed precious metals transactions fall squarely within the Commission's jurisdiction
under Section 2(c)(2)(D) of the Act.

Respondents' retail financed precious metals transactions executed through Hunter
Wise did not result in actual delivery to the customer. As found by the district court and
affirmed by the Eleventh Circuit in Hunter Wise, Hunter Wise had no actual metal to deliver.
Hunter Wise, Case No. 9:12-cy-81311-DMM, slip op. at 12-14, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35770
(S.D. Fla., Feb. 19, 2014) (order granting summary judgment); U.S. CFTC vy. Hunter Wise
Commodities, LLC, 749 F.3d 967, 982 (1 1" Cir, 2014). Respondents' transactions are not
excepted from the Commission's jurisdiction under Section 2(c)(2)(D)Gi)(HD of the Act.

C, Respondents Violated Section 4(a) of the Act: legal, Off-Exchange Transactions

As stated above, retail commodity transactions within the scope of Section 2(c)(2)(D)
of the Act are subject to enforcement under Section 4(a) of the Act, among other provisions, as
if such transactions are commodity futures contracts. Section 4(a) of the Act makes it unlawful
for any person to offer to enter into, enter into, execute, confirm the execution of, or conduct
an office or business in the United States for the purpose of soliciting, or accepting any order
for, or otherwise dealing in any transaction in, or in connection with, a commodity futures
contract, unless such transaction is made on or subject to the rules of a board of trade that has
been designated or registered by the CFTC as a contract market or derivatives transaction
execution facility for the specific commodity.

Respondents offered to enter into, entered into, and confirmed the execution of retail
financed precious metals transactions. Respondents also conducted an office and business in
the United States for the purpose of soliciting, accepting orders for, and otherwise dealing in
retail financed precious metals transactions. None of the retail financed precious metals
transactions were conducted on or subject to the rules of a board of trade that has been

 
designated or registered by the CFTC as a contract market or derivatives transaction execution
facility for precious metals. Respondents therefore violated Section 4(a) of the Act.

D. Midwest is Liable for the Violations of its Agents

Midwest is liable for the violations of its agents, including Ekasala. Under Section
2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C, Â§ 2(a)(1)(B) (2012), as well as Regulation 1.2, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.2
(2013), a principal is strictly liable for the violations of its agents made within the scope of the
agents' employment. Rosenthal & Co. v. CFTC, 802 F.2d 963, 966 (7th Cir. 1986). Ekasala,
along with other Midwest telemarketers, were agents of Midwest, and in the scope of their
employment they violated Section 4(a) of the Act. Midwest is therefore liable for these
violations.

E. Ekasala Is Liable as the Controlling Person Under Section 13(b) of the Act for
Midwest's Violations

Ekasala is directly liable for violations of Section 4(a) of the Act. In addition, Ekasala
directly controlled Midwest and directly and knowingly induced Midwest's conduct
constituting violations of the Act; therefore, pursuant to Section 13(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.

Â§ 13c(b) (2012), Ekasala is liable for Midwest 's violations of Section 4(a) of the Act. Section
13(b) of the Act states that a controlling person of an entity is liable for the violations of that
entity, provided that the controlling person knowingly induced, directly or indirectly, the
violations, or provided that the controlling person did not act in good faith. "A fundamental
purpose of Section [13(b)] is to allow the Commission to reach behind the corporate entity to
the controlling individuals of the corporation and to impose liability for violations of the Act
directly on such individuals as well as the corporation itself." CFTC v. R.J. Fitzgerald & Co.,
Inc., 310 F.3d 1321, 1334 (11th Cir. 2002) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted),
cert, denied, 543 U.S. 1034 (2004).

To establish controlling person liability under Section 13(b), the Division must show
both (1) control; and (2) lack of good faith or knowing inducement of the acts constituting the
violation. Jn re First Natâl Trading Corp., [1992-1994 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep.
(CCH) Â¥ 26,142 at 41,787 (CFTC Jul. 20, 1994), affd without opinion sub nom. Pick v.
CFTC, 99 P.3d 1139 (6th Cir. 1996). To establish the first element, control, a defendant must
possess general control over the operation of the entity principally liable. See, eg, RJ
Fitzgerald, 310 F.3d at 1334 (recognizing an individual who "exercised the ultimate choice-
making power within the firm regarding its business decisions" as a controlling person).
Evidence that a defendant is an officer, founder, principal, or the authorized signatory on the
company's bank accounts indicates the power to control a company. In re Spiegel, [1987-1990
Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) 24,103 at 34,767 (CFTC Jan. 12, 1988). The
Division must also show that a defendant possessed specific control, which is "the power or
ability to control the specific transaction or activity upon which the primary violation was
predicated." Monieson v CFTC, 996 F.2d 852, 860 (7th Cir. 1993) (internal quotation marks
and citation omitted). The defendant does not need to participate in or benefit from the
wrongdoing; the issue is whether the defendant has the power to address the illegal conduct.

 
/d. (finding that, in a trade allocation case, the fact that the defendant could fire or discipline
responsible employees, end the placement of orders without numbers as soon as the defendant
knew of it, or order a full investigation was sufficient to show specific control).

With respect to control, Ekasala was the owner and operator of Midwest. He managed
the day-to-day operations, hired employees, supervising the solicitation of retail customers and
engaging in solicitations himself. Ekasala was the ultimate decision maker and controlled all
aspects of Midwestâs business. Ekasala had both general control over Midwest and specific
control over the conduct underlying Midwest's violations, i.e., Midwest offering to enter into,
entering into, and confirming the execution of retail financed precious metals transactions, and
Midwest conducting an office and business in the United States for soliciting, accepting, and
otherwise dealing in retail financed precious metals transactions.

In addition to control, the Division must show the controlling person knowingly
induced, directly or indirectly, the acts constituting the violation or did not act in good faith.
To show knowing inducement, the Division must show that a defendant had actual or
constructive knowledge of the core activities that constituted the violation and allowed the
activities to continue. Jn re Spiegel, [1987-1990 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH)
at 34,767. To show lack of good faith, the Division must show that a defendant did not have
an adequate system of internal supervision, or that a defendant did not enforce such system
with reasonable diligence. Monieson, 996 F.2d at 860.

Ekasala had actual knowledge that Midwest's business was in off-exchange, retail
financed precious metals transactions, because it was the basic nature or essence of the firmâs
business activities. He also allowed the business to continue, Thus, Ekasala knowingly
induced the conduct in violation of Section 4(a) of the Act. Moreover, Ekasala also did not act
in good faith, because he failed to have in place an adequate supervisory system to ensure that
the off-exchange leveraged precious metals transactions that Midwest Metals pitched to
customers were fully compliant with the requirements of the CEA. Therefore, in addition to
being directly liable for his personal violations of Section 4(a) of the Act, he is liable as a
controlling person for Midwest Metalsâ violations of Section 4(a).
