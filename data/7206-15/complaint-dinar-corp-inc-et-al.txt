~ COMPLAINT FOR PERMANENT INJUNCTION, CIVIL MONETARY PENALTIES,
AND OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF

Plaintiff, United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“Commission”), by its

attorneys, alleges as follows:

fraudulent scheme involving the offering of agreements, contracts or transactions in off-
exchange foreign currency (“forex”) on a leveraged, margined, or financed basis to retail
customers who were not eligible contract participants (““ECPs’”) and that do not result in actual

delivery of ‘forex within two (2) days of the transaction date(s). Defendants, who have never

illegal, off-exchange retail forex transactions.
2. Tayeh created and operates DCI and Monex NV, business entities that he uses to
facilitate the Defendants’ fraudulent activities and that act as the counterparty(s) in the subject
agreements, contracts or transactions in forex. Defendants operate their fraudulent scheme via
the Internet through the use of the website www. dinarcorp.com (“website”), by offering, and
entering into, transactions in forex with non-ECP retail customers that are leveraged, margined
or financed by the Defendants, and that result in actual delivery of forex — if at all - within
periods of not less than fifteen (15) days and as much as one hundred twenty (120) days
following the date of the transaction(s). |

3. In furtherance of the fraudulent scheme, Tayeh, individually and on behalf of DCI
and Monex NV, made, and continues to make, material misrepresentations and omit material
_ facts in solicitations to actual and prospective customers via the website, including but not
limited to: (a) representing that DCI operates a “fully licensed and fully compliant licensed
money services business” but failing to disclose that DCI has been served with cease and desist
orders in the states of Texas and Illinois for operating without required licenses; (b) representing
that DCI and Monex NV provide the “best price guaranteed” and the “best prices up front all the
time” but failing to disclose that the forex transactions they offer to retail customers include
' significant finance charges; (c) failing to disclose that DCI and Monex NV are each operating as
a registered foreign exchange dealer (“RF ED”) without being registered with the Commission as
required; and (d) failing to disclose that Tayeh is acting as an associated person (“AP”) of an
RFED(s) without being registered with the Commission as required.

4. By virtue of this conduct and the further conduct described herein, the Defendants
have engaged, are engaging, or are about to engage in acts and practices in violation of Section

4b(a)(2)(A) and (C) of the Commodity Exchange Act (the “Act”), as amended, 7 U.S.C.

VL FACTS

A. The Transactions in Forex

25, The Defendants, through their website, offer to enter into, and enter into,
transactions in forex with retail customers who are not ECPs by offering to act as the
counterparty to transactions in Vietharnese Dong and/or Iraqi Dinar. As the sole officer and
controlling person of both DCI and Monex NV, Tayeh is responsible for the content of the
website both individually, and as the agent of DCI and Monex NV.

26. Under the caption “Dinar Corp., Inc., Securing Your Future,” the Defendants,
through their website, offer customers transactions in forex utilizing a variety of financing |
options, which customers cari choose by selecting the “Dinarcorp15,” “Dinarcorp 45,”
“Dinarcorp60+,” “Dinarcorp90,” or the “Dinarcorp120+Max” options displayed on the website.

27. Each of the above payment plans are financed by the Defendants, acting as the
counterparty, and none of the payment plans offered to customers result in actual delivery of
forex within 2 days of the transaction(s). Instead, retail customers receive their forex, ifat all,
over periods of not less than fifteen (15) days, and up to one hundred twenty (120) days,

following the date of the transaction in forex.

28. For éexaniple, the Defendants’ “Dinar Corp 120+ Max” option, as described on the
website, offers actual and prospective customers a “five payment program” that “allows clients
to lock in their rate for a duration of 120 days and to submit their entire payment within a 120
day period.” The first payment is characterized as a “non-refundable Purchase Payment” of ten

percent (10%) of the total transaction amount. The second payment is due thirty (30) days later,

-8-
and the third, fourth and fifth payments are due in subsequent thirty (30) day intervals. The last,

and fifth payment, comprises sixty percent (60%) of the purchase price. If customers miss.a
payiment, the entire first payment is forfeited. |

29. Customers are offered a variety of options as to the amount of the transaction in
forex they may choose to enter into with the Defendants, each of which carries a significant

. financing charge included within the transaction. For example, if a customer chooses to enter
into a transaction nominally involving one million dinars, the customer would be charged a total
of One Thousand Fifty Dollars ($1,050.00). At the current exchange rate of approximately One
U.S. dollar ($1.00) for 1,163 Iraqi Dinars, or Eight Hundred Sixty Dollars ($860) for 1 million
Iraqi Dinars, the transaction offered by the Defendants includes an undisclosed finance charge of
approximately twenty-two percent (22%).

30. | Customers enter into transactions in forex with the Defendants by submitting an
online account application through the website.

31. | Once a customer agrees to enter into a transaction in forex with the Defendants,
the customer is advised that the Defendants only accept money orders or cashier’s checks as
payment. Customers are directed to make their funds payable not to DCI, but to “My Monex,
Inc.”

B. The Fraudulent Scheme
32. The Defendants solicit transactions in forex by omitting, and misrepresenting,
material ‘facts in their solicitations to actual and prospective customers.
33. The Defendants represent to actual and prospective customers via their website

that DCI is a: “Licensed Money Services Business...fully registered and fully compliant.” These

representations are false. The Defendants are barred from conducting business as a “money

=9-
services business” in Texas and Illinois for failing to comply with the relevant laws of those
states, and none of the Defendants are registered as required with the Commission.

34, The Defendants also omit from their communications with prospective and actual
customers other material facts. Thtough the website, the Defendants represent that DCI has the
“(Best Prices Guaranteed...no special codes, no secret discount, just best prices up front all the
time.” However, Defendants fail to advise customers of material facts regarding the true cost of
the transactions offered by the Defendants, including but not limited to, that the transactions
include an undisclosed finance charge of up to twenty-two (22%) percent of the overall cost of
each transaction.

35. Through the website, the Defendants further represent to actual and prospective
customers that “[DCI] does not offer services to or ship to residents of Illinois or Arkansas.”
However, nowhere on the website do the Defendants advise actual or prospective customers that
the states of Illinois and Texas have issued cease and desist orders against DCI, barring it from
conducting business in those states due to DCI’s failure to comply with those states’ licensing
requirements prior to conducting business therein.

36. The Defendants fail to disclose additional material facts to prospective and actual
customers, including but not limited to: that DCI, Monex NV and Monex AL are not registered
as RFEDs as required by federal law; b) that Tayeh is not registered as an AP of an RFED(s) as
required by federal law; and c) that the Defendants’ are conducting an illegal business absent
such registrations.

37. The online account application does not seek any information about prospective

customers’ net worth or customers’ business need for foreign currency.

-10-
38. The online account application does not inquire as to whether a prospective
customer is an ECP or about a prospective customer’s savings and investments. The online
account application does not inquire if a prospective customer has assets in excess of $5 million.

39. | Upon information and belief, few, if any, of the Defendants’ retail customers are
ECPs. None of the transactions in forex offered by the Defendants involve a security that is not
a security futures product.

C. Failure to Register with Commission

40. Throughout the relevant period, DCI and Monex NV solicit and/or accept orders
from customers who are not ECPs to enter into agreements, contracts or transactions in forex,
which are financed by the Defendants.

41. Thus, DCI and Monex NV are each acting as an RFED and continue to do so by
soliciting or accepting orders from customers who are not ECPs to engage in agreements, —
contracts or trasactions in forex which are financed by the Defendants.

42. As of the date of the filing of this Complaint, neither DCI nor Monex NV have
registered with the Commission as an RFED, in violation of Regulation 5.3(a)(6)(i), 17 C.F.R.
§ 5.3(a)(6)@) (2014).

43, Throughout the rélevant period, Tayeh has been the sole officer of both DCI and
Monex NV; therefore, he has been an AP of both DCI and Monex NV because he is a partner,
officer or employee, acting in a capacity that involves the solicitation or acceptance of retail
fotéx customers’ orders, or the supervision of any person or persons so engaged.

44. __ As of the date of the filing of this Complaint, Tayeh has not registered with the

Commission as an AP of RFEDs DCI and/or Monex NV, in violation of Regulation 5.3(a)(6)(ii),

17 CER. § 5.3(a)(6)(ii) (2014).

-11-
45.  Atno time during the relevant period has DCI or Monex NV been exempt from
the requirement to register as an RFED.

46.  Atnotime during the relevant period has Tayeh been exempt from the
requirement to register as an AP of an RFED.

D. Relief Defendants Received Funds To Which They Have No Legitimate
Claim

47, Throughout the relevant period, Defendarits have worked with Hudson, and
caused Hudson to create and operate Monex AL, for the purpose of negotiating cashier’s checks
and money orders made payable by customers to “My Monex, Inc.,” in bank accounts opened by
Hudson in the name of Monex AL, at various banks within this District, with Hudson as a
signatory on each account.

48. | However, all of these cashier’s checks and money order were made payable to
Monex NV, not Monex AL. Therefore, as the sole officer of Monex AL, Hudson knew at the
time of each such deposit that none of these cashier’s checks and money orders should have. been
deposited into the bank accounts in the name of Monex AL, and that neither Hudson nor Monex
AL had a legitimate claim to the customers’ funds.

49. Defendants have sent millions of dollars of customer’s cashier’s checks and/or
money orders to Hudson at his home in Dothan, Alabama.

50. After Hudson deposits customers’ cashier’s checks and money orders made
payable to Monex NV into bank accounts carried in the name of Monex AL, Hudson then remits
customer funds back to Tayeh and entities he created and/or controls, less five percent (5%)

retained by Hudson and Monex AL as a purported “processing fee.”

-12-
51. Upon information and belief, Hudson and. Monex AL have no legitimate claim to
the customer funds they hold, or the “processing fees” they have collected, all of which were

obtained as a result of the Defendaiits’ fraudulent conduct.
