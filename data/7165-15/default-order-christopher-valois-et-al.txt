Commodities Trading LLC (“Churchhill”) (collectively “Defendants”). For the
reasons stated below, the Commission’s Application is GRANTED and an Order
of Permanent Injunction together with civil monetary penalties and restitution
relief is contained herein.’
I, BACKGROUND

On January 28, 2015, the Commission filed a Complaint for Injunctive and
Other Equitable Relief and Penalties Under the Commodity Exchange Act
(“Complaint”) alleging that Defendants violated the Commodity Exchange Act
(“Act”), as amended, 7 U.S.C § | ef seg. (2012). The Commission’s Complaint
alleges that Defendants solicited, obtained and/or mananged $737,000 from six
customers. According to the Commission’s Complaint, a portion of these funds
were to used to purchase precious metals and a portion was to be traded in futures
trading accounts. The Commision’s Complaint alleges that Defendants defrauded
their customers by claiming that they were purchasing precious metals on behalf of
some of the customers, when they were not; misrepresenting profit potential and
risk of loss associated with the trading of commodity futures contracts and
precious metals; and misappropriating customer funds. Additionally, the

Commission’s Complaint alleges that Defendants were not registered with the

 

* Having read and considered the papers presented by the Commission, the Court finds this

matter appropriate for disposition without a hearing. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 78; Local Rule 7-15.
Accordingly, the hearing set for May 4, 2015 at 1:30 p.m. is hereby vacated and off calendar.

Commission as commodity trading advisors (“CTAs”) as required, and therefore,
unlawfully traded customer funds in managed futures accounts.
Il. PROCEDURAL HISTORY

On January 28, 2015, the Commission filed its Complaint. On January 30,
2015, this Court entered an Ex Parte Statutory Restraining Order freezing
Defendants’ assets, prohibiting the destruction of, or prevention of CFTC access to
Defendants’ books and records, and providing for other relief. (Dkt. No. 25). On
February 13, 2015, this Court entered an Order of Preliminary Injunction, finding
that there is good cause to believe that the Defendants have engaged, are engaging,
or are about to engage in conduct in violations of the Act, and preliminarily
enjoining Defendants from directly or indirectly violating Sections 4(a) and
4b(a)(2)(A) and (C), 7 U.S.C. § 6(a), 6b(a)(2)(A) and (C) (2012), and from
engaging in activities subject to the Commission’s jurisdiction. (Dkt. No. 33).

The Commission properly served Defendants with a summons and the
Complaint on February 3, 2015. On that date, the Commission served Valois and
Wong via personal service (Dkt. Nos. 28, 30); and completed service upon Bertram
and Churchhill by serving summons upon Valois. (Dkt. No. 29). Defendants failed
to answer, plead, or otherwise respond to the Complaint within 21 days and on
February 25, 2015, this Court entered a default against the Defendants pursuant to
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (“F.R.Civ.P.”) Rule 55(a) for failure to defend and
failure to comply with the Court’s orders. (Dkt. No. 34). The Court instructed the

Commission to file a motion for default judgment at its earliest convenience and to
set a hearing date in accordance with local rules 6-1 and 55-1. Jd.

The Court has carefully considered the Complaint, the factual allegations
which are well-pled and hereby taken as true, and the Commission’s Application
and the Memorandum and Exhibits in support thereof. Having been fully advised
and familiar with the record in this matter, the Court hereby enters findings of fact
and conclusions of law, and issues a final order of permanent injunction,
restitution, a civil monetary penalty, and other equitable relief pursuant to Section
6c of the Act, as amended, 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1, as set forth herein.

HI. FINDINGS OF FACT
A. Parties

The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an independent federal
regulatory agency charged by Congress with the responsibility for administering and
enforcing the provisions of the Act, 7 U.S.C. §§ 1 et seq., and the Commission’s
Regulations promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. §§ 1.1 et seg. (2014).

Christopher Valois resides in Irvine, California. Valois was registered with
the Commission intermittently between 1998 and 2009 as a CTA, introducing
broker (“IB”) and associated person (“AP”). However, since August 2009, Valois
has not been registered with the Commission in any capacity. In August 2010, the
National Futures Association (“NFA”), the self-regulatory organization designated
by Plaintiff CFTC to register futures industry professionals, permanently barred

Valois from NFA membership for making deceptive and misleading sales
solicitations, using misleading and deceptive promotional material, and
unauthorized trading of customer accounts, among other things. In the NFA’s
decision to permanently bar Valois, it found that “Valois has no regard for the
[futures] regulatory structure . . . and poses a threat to customer protection.”

Cynthia Wong resides in Irvine, California. Wong was never been
registered with the Commission in any capacity. Wong is married to Valois.
Wong formed Bertram Trade and operated it with Valois.

Bertram Trade LLC is a California limited liability company which had a
business address of 7 Cobalt Drive, Dana Point, California 92629 from March
2009 to October 2011. Valois and Wong formed Bertram Trade in March 2009
and shut it down in approximately October 2011. During that period Valois and
Wong controlled Bertram Trade and were responsible for Bertram Trade’s
operations, solicitation of clients, and receipt and use of customer funds. Bertram
Trade maintained a website at www.bertramtrade.com during the same time
period. Bertram Trade offered leveraged investments in precious metals to retail
customers. Bertram Trade has never been registered with the Commission in any
capacity.

Churchhill Commodities Trading LLC is a California limited liability
company which has used a business address of 17266 Candleberry, Irvine,
California 92612 since March 2012. Valois and Wong formed Churchill in March

2012 after shutting Bertram down. During that period Valois controlled Churchhill
and was responsible for its operations, solicitation of clients, and receipt and use of
customer funds. Churchill’s website at www.churchillcommoditiestrading.com is
identical to Bertram Trade’s former website and until recently was still active.
Churchill has never been registered with the Commission in any capacity.

B. Defendants’ Conduct

In 2010, the NFA barred Defendant Valois from NFA membership for
defrauding customers. Valois and his wife, Wong, subsequently formed Bertram
Trade, and then Churchhill, through which they fraudulently solicited, managed or
obtained $737,000 from six customers.

Customers tendered $352,500 of those funds ostensibly to purchase
leveraged purchase precious metals through Bertram Trade and Churchhill. The
customer funds went into bank accounts that Valois and Wong controlled.

Defendants claimed, through the Bertram Trade and Churchill websites, to
buy, store and insure leveraged precious metals for customers and claimed that
customers could access the precious metals at any time. However, Defendants did
not provide any precious metals to customers. Of the $352,500 invested for the
purpose of purchasing precious metals, customers received only $8,100 back, and
no customer ever received any precious metals. Instead, Defendants used the
overwhelming majority of the funds—$344,400—to pay their personal expenses
and Bertram Trade’s and Churchhill’s business and operational expenses.

One of Valois and Wong’s customers was a 73 year old retiree (“Stenlund”),
who lost over $400,000 in retirement funds investing in precious metals and
managed futures with them. Valois and Wong solicited Stenlund to purchase
precious metals and to trade futures by emphasizing the profitability of both.
However, Stenlund never received any precious metals and his futures accounts
suffered nearly complete losses. Neither Valois nor Wong ever informed Stenlund
about the losses in, and status of, his accounts. When Stenlund ran out of money to
invest, a Bertram Trade account executive who worked with Stenlund threatened
and harassed Stenlund and his wife.

Defendants unlawfully traded another $384,500 of customer funds in
managed futures accounts. In addition to these customers, Valois attempted to
obtain funds from another customer (“DeRoze”) to trade futures on DeRoze’s
behalf. Valois told DeRoze the funds would be traded in a friend’s name so that
Valois could “get around” the NFA ban, and Valois also directed DeRoze not to
cooperate with any federal regulatory inquiries into his conduct. Defendants were
not registered as commodity trading advisors, as required, to trade customer funds
in managed futures accounts.

IV. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
A. Jurisdiction and Venue are Proper
This Court possesses jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 6c of

the Act, as amended, 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1, which authorizes the Commission to seek

injunctive and other relief against any person whenever it shall appear to the
Commission that such person has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in
any act or practice constituting a violation of the Act or any rule, regulation, or
order thereunder. Defendants have engaged, are engaging, or are about to engage
in acts or practices that constitute a violation of the Act and Commission
Regulations.

Venue properly lies with this Court pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act,

7 U.S.C. § 13a-1(e)}, because Defendants reside in and transacted business within
this district and the acts and practices in violation of the Act occurred, are
occurring, or are about to occur, within this district.

B. Entry of Default Judgment Against Defendants is Appropriate

After a party’s default has been entered, the party who sought the default
may file a motion requesting the entry of a default judgment. Fed. R.Civ.P. Rule
55(b)(2). See also Ring Central, Inc. v. Quimby, 711 F. Supp. 2d 1048, 1057 (N.D.
Cal. 2010). The decision to grant a motion for default judgment is within the
sound discretion of the district court. Fed. R.Civ.P. 55(b); Aldabe v. Aldabe, 616
F.2d 1089, 1092 (9th Cir.1980).

The Ninth Circuit has identified seven factors courts should consider when
determining whether to grant a default judgment: (1) the possibility of prejudice to
plaintiff; (2) the merits of plaintiffs substantive claim; (3) the sufficiency of the
complaint; (4) the sum of money at stake in the action; (5) the possibility of a

dispute concerning the material facts; (6) whether the default was due to excusable
neglect, and; (7) the strong policy underlying the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
favoring decisions on the merits. Eitel v. McCool, 782 F.2d 1470, 1471-72 (9th
Cir.1986). Failure to make a timely answer to a properly served complaint will
justify the entry of a default judgment. Benny v. Pipes, 799 F.2d 489, 492 (9th Cir.
1986).

In a default, the well-pled factual allegations of the complaint, except those
relating to the amount of damages, will be taken as true. Geddes v. United Fin.
Group, 559 F.2d 557, 560 (9th Cir. 1977) (citing Pope v. United States, 323 U.S. 1,
12 (1944); Flaks v. Koegel, 504 F.2d 702, 707 (2d Cir. 1974)). A default judgment
may be entered without a hearing on damages, however, when the amount claimed
is liquidated or capable of ascertainment from the definite figures contained in the
documentary evidence or in detailed affidavits. See, e.g. Franchise Holding II,
LLC v. Huntington Rest. Group, Inc., 375 F.3d 922, 929 (9th Cir. 2004); Davis v.
Fendler, 650 F.2d 1154, 1161 (9th Cir. 1981). Thereafter, the judgment entered by
default is treated as a conclusive and final adjudication of the issues necessary to
justify the relief awarded. Danning v. Lavine, 572 F.2d 1386, 1388 (9th Cir. 1978)
(citing Thompson, 114 U.S. at 113-14; Geddes v. United Fin. Group, 559 F.2d 557
(9th Cir. 1977)).

The Commission’s Complaint contains well-pled allegations that establish
the necessary elements for each cause of action against the Defendants.

Defendants were served with the pleadings, yet have failed to participate in any
aspect of this litigation, and the Commission’s interest in enforcing the Act would
be prejudiced if such default judgment is not entered. Further, as supported by the
Commission’s Application and Memorandum In Support of Application For Entry
of Default Judgment and documents referenced therein, entry of this judgment is
warranted.

C. Violations of the Commodity Exchange Act

The well-pled allegations of the Complaint establish that Defendants

violated certain provisions of the Act and the Regulations and that a reasonable
likelihood of a future violation exists. Therefore, the issuance of the permanent
injunctive relief requested by the Commission is justified.

1. Defendants Violated Section 4(a) of the Act By Offering and
Entering Into, Off-Exchange Precious Metals Transactions

Section 4(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 6(a), as applied to retail commodity
transactions, makes it illegal for any person to offer to enter into, enter into,
execute, confirm the execution of, or conduct any office or business anywhere in
the United States for the purpose of soliciting, or accepting any order for, or
otherwise dealing in retail commodity transactions unless the transactions are
conducted on a regulated exchange.

Valois and Wong operated businesses (Bertram Trade and Churchhill) in the
United States through which they obtained $352,500 from customers for the

purpose of soliciting and accepting orders for retail commodity transactions,

specifically precious metals transactions. Defendants’ precious metals transactions
were not conducted on a regulated exchange and no customers ever received any
precious metals. Therefore, Defendants offer and entry into these transactions
violated Section 4(a) of the Act.

2. Defendants Violated Section 4b(a) of the Act By Defrauding
Customers

Section 4b(a) of the Act, in pertinent part, prohibits any person from
cheating, defrauding or deceiving any other person in or in connection with the
offering or entering into retail commodity transactions. Section 4b(a) of the Act
prohibits fraud in connection with retail commodity transactions under Section
4b(a)(2)(A) and (C) as well as fraud in connection with commodity futures
contracts under Section 4b(a)(1)(A) and (C). Fraud under Section 4b(a) of the Act
may be proven by misrepresentations or omission of material fact or by
misappropriation. To establish misrepresentation and omission liability under
Section 4b(a) of the Act, the Commission must prove that: (1) a misrepresentation,
misleading statement, or omission was made; (2) with scienter; and (3) that the
misrepresentation, statement or omission was material. CFTC v. R.J. Fitzgerald &
Co., Inc., 310 F.3d 1321, 1328 (11th Cir. 2002), cert. denied, 125 S.Ct. 808 (2004)
(citations omitted). Misappropriating customer funds also violates Section
4b(a)(2)(A) and (C). See, e.g., CFTC v. Noble Wealth Data Info. Servs., Inc., 90 F.
Supp. 2d 676, 687 (D. Md. 2000) (defendants violated Section 4b(a)(2)(i) and (iii)

(the predecessor to 4b(a)(2)(A) and (C)) by diverting investor funds for operating

expenses and personal use), aff'd, CFTC v. Baragosh, 278 F.3d 319 (4th Cir.), cert.
denied, 537 U.S. 950 (2002).

Here Defendants violated Section 4b(a) of the Act by knowingly or with
reckless disregard for the truth or falsity, misrepresenting and omitting material |
facts to customers, including falsely representing that they bought, stored, insured,
and would provide customers with precious metals; misrepresented the likelihood
of profit and failed to disclose losses incurred in the trading commodity futures
contracts in managed futures accounts; and misappropriated customer funds.
Therefore, Defendants fraudulent misconduct and misappropriation of customer
money violated Sections 4b(a)(1)(A),(C) and 4b(a)(2)(A),(C) of the Act.

3. Valois and Wong Violated Section 4m(1) of the Act By Operating
As Unregistered Commodity Trading Advisors

Section 4m(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 6m(1), makes it unlawful for any CTA
to make use of the mails or any means of the instrumentalities of interstate
commerce in connection with its business as a CTA unless registered under the
Act. A CTA is any person who, for compensation or profit, engages in the
business of advising others either directly or through publications, writings or
electronic media, as to the value or the advisability of trading in any contract of
sale of a commodity for future delivery ... or for compensation or profit, and as
part of a regular business, issues or promulgates analyses or reports concerning any

of the activities referred to above. Section la(12) of the Act, 7U.S.C. § la(i2).

Defendants Valois and Wong violated Section 4m(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
§ 6m(1), by, while making use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of
interstate commerce and for compensation or profit, trading $384,500 of customer
funds in managed futures accounts without being registered with the Commission
as CTAs. Therefore, Valois and Wong managed futures accounts for customers
without the required registration in violation of Section 4m(1) of the Act.

4. Valois and Wong Violated Section 40(1)(A) and (B) of the Act by
Engaging in CTA Fraud

Section 40(1)(A) and (B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 60(1)(A),(B), makes it
unlawful for a CTA to make use of the mails or any means or instrumentalities of
interstate commerce, directly or indirectly to (A) employ any device, scheme, or
artifice to defraud any client or prospective client; or (B) to engage in any
transaction or course of business which operates as a fraud or deceit upon any
client or prospective client.

Defendants Valois and Wong violated Section 40(1)(A) and (B) of the Act,
by, while acting as a CTA over managed futures accounts, knowingly or with
reckless disregard for the truth or falsity, misrepresenting and omitting material
facts to customers, including misrepresenting the likelihood of profit, failing to
disclose losses incurred in trading commodity futures accounts, and
misappropriating customer funds. Therefore, Valois and Wong engaged in fraud
and misappropriation while operating as CTAs in violation of Section 40(1)(A) and

(B) of the Act.

5. Controlling Person and Principal-Agent Liability

Valois controlled Bertram Trade and Churchhill, directly or indirectly, and
did not act in good faith or knowingly induced, directly or indirectly, Bertram
Trade’s and Churchhill’s act or acts in violation of the Act; therefore, pursuant to
Section 13(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 13c(b) (2012), Valois is liable for Bertram
Trade’s and Churchhill’s respective violations of Sections 4(a), 4b(a)(1)(A) and
(C), 4b(a)(2)(A) and (C), 4m(1) and 40(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. §§ 6(a),
6b(a)(1)(A),(C), 6b(a)(2)(A),(C), 6m(1), and 60(1) (2012).

Wong controlled Bertram Trade, directly or indirectly, and did not act in
good faith or knowingly induced, directly or indirectly, Bertram Trade’s act or acts
in violation of the Act; therefore, pursuant to Section 13(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. §
13c(b) (2012), Wong is liable for Bertram Trade’s violations of Sections 4(a),
4b(a)(1)(A) and (C), 4b(a)(2)(A) and (C), 4m(1) and 40(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
§§ 6(a), 6b(a)(1)(A),(C), 6b(a)(2)(A),(C), 6m(1), and 60(1) (2012).

The foregoing acts, omissions, and failures of Valois and Wong occurred
within the scope of their employment, office, or agency with Bertram Trade and
Churchhill; therefore, pursuant to Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.

§ 2(a)(1)(B) (2012), and Regulation 1.2, 17 C.F.R. § 1.2 (2014), Bertram Trade
and Churchhill are liable for Valois’ and Wong’s acts, omissions, and failures in

violation of Sections 4(a), 4b(a)(1)(A) and (C), 4b(a)(2)(A) and (C), 4m(1) and

D. Permanent Injunction

Section 6c(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 13a-1(a), authorizes district courts to
issue injunctions for violations of the Act upon a proper showing by the
Commission. To make a proper showing, the Commission must establish that a
person violated and Is likely to continue violating the Act, the latter of which may
be inferred from past unlawful conduct. CFTC v. Co Petro Marketing Group, Inc.,
680 F.2d 566, 583 (9th Cir. 1981); CFTC v. British American Commodity Options
Corp., 560 F.2d 135 at 142 (2™ Cir. 1977). The Commission has adequately
demonstrated that Defendants engaged in fraud, unregistered CTA activity, and
misappropriation of customer funds, and that there is a reasonable likelihood of
future violations.

OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF
