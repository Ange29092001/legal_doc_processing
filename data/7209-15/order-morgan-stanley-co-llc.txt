ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTIONS 6(c) AND 6(d) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, MAKING
FINDINGS AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

I,

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“Commission”) has reason to believe that
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC (“Morgan Stanley” or “Respondent”) violated Commission
Regulations 22.9 and 166.3. Therefore, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public
interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted to determine
whether Respondent engaged in the violations set forth herein and to determine whether any
order should be issued imposing remedial sanctions.

IT.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Respondent has
submitted an Offer of Settlement (“Offer”), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Without admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, Respondent consents to
the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 6(c) and 6(d) of the
Commodity Exchange Act, Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (“Order”) and
acknowledges service of this Order.!

 

' Respondent consents to the entry of this Order and to the use of these findings in this proceeding and in
any other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party; provided,
however, that Respondent does not consent to the use of the Offer, or the findings or conclusions in this
Order consented to in the Offer, as the sole basis for any other proceeding brought by the Commission,
other than in a proceeding in bankruptcy or to enforce the terms of this Order. Nor does Respondent
consent to the use of the Offer or this Order, or the findings or conclusions in this Order consented to in
the Offer, by any other party in any other proceeding.
Il.
The Commission finds the following:
A. SUMMARY

On numerous days from March 12, 2013 to March 7, 2014, Morgan Stanley failed to hold
sufficient US Dollars in segregated accounts in the United States on behalf of cleared swaps
customers to meet all US Dollar obligations to those customers, as specified in Regulations
1.49(b)(1) and (e), in violation of Regulation 22.9(a). During a longer period, from November 8,
2012 to on or about April 8, 2014, Morgan Stanley did not have in place adequate procedures to
ensure that it complied with Regulation 22.9(a), in violation of Regulation 166.3.

B. RESPONDENT

Morgan Stanley is a financial services firm, organized under the laws of Delaware, which
is registered with the Commission as an FCM, provisionally registered with the Commission as a
swap dealer, and registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission as a broker-dealer.
Morgan Stanley’s principal office is in New York, New York. Among other things, Morgan
Stanley executes and clears customer transactions in commodity futures, swaps, stocks, and
options in the United States and worldwide.

C. FACTS

From March 12, 2013 to March 7, 2014, on numerous days, Morgan Stanley failed to
hold sufficient US Dollars in segregated accounts in the United States to meet all of its US
Dollar obligations to cleared swaps customers. On those dates, Morgan Stanley held the amount
of the US Dollar deficits in Euros and other currencies, rather than in US Dollars, when its
cleared swaps customers did not deposit such funds in or request conversion to those currencies,
and when funds did not accrue to the customers in those currencies as a result of cleared swaps
carried through Morgan Stanley, to the extent of such accruals. The size of Morgan Stanley’s
US Dollar deficits ranged from approximately $5 million to approximately $265 million, at times
representing more than ten percent of the amount that the firm was obligated to maintain in US
Dollars for cleared swaps customers. Because Morgan Stanley held the amount of the US Dollar
deficits in Euros and other currencies, it did not have a shortfall in overall cleared swaps
customer collateral. Nonetheless, on the days at issue, Morgan Stanley did not maintain
sufficient US Dollars in segregation to meet its US Dollar obligations to cleared swaps
customers, in violation of Regulation 22.9(a).

From November 8, 2012 to on or about April 8, 2014, Morgan Stanley did not have in
place adequate procedures to comply with the currency denomination requirements for holding
cleared swaps customer collateral as required by Regulation 22.9(a), and Morgan Stanley did not
train and supervise its personnel to ensure compliance with Regulation 22.9(a). On or about
April 8, 2014, Morgan Stanley learned of its failure to comply with Regulation 22.9(a) from a
routine financial examination conducted by the Financial and Regulatory Surveillance
Department of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (“CME”). Morgan Stanley promptly
investigated the deficiencies and implemented procedures to ensure that it would maintain
sufficient US Dollars to satisfy its requirements for holding cleared swaps customer collateral.

2
Morgan Stanley also promptly reported the deficiencies to the Commission and cooperated with
the Division of Enforcement in its investigation relating to this proceeding.

IV.
LEGAL DISCUSSION
A. Failure to Maintain Sufficient US Dollars for Cleared Swaps Obligations

In relevant part, Regulation 22.9(a) provides, subject to Regulation 22.9(b), that FCMs
“may hold Cleared Swaps Customer Collateral in the denominations, at the locations and
depositories, and subject to the segregation requirements specified in [Regulation 1.49].” 17

C.F.R. § 22.9(a).?

Regulation 1.49(b)(1) provides that “a [FCM’s] obligations to a customer shall be
denominated: (i) [iJn the United States dollar; (ii) [i]n a currency in which funds were deposited
by the customer or were converted at the request of the customer, to the extent of such deposits
and conversions; or (iii) [i]n a currency in which funds have accrued to the customer as a result
of trading conducted on a designated contract market, to the extent of such accruals.” See also
Regulation 22.9(b) (providing that ‘‘a [FCM’s] obligations to a Cleared Swaps Customer may be
denominated in a currency in which funds have accrued to the Cleared Swaps Customer as a
result of a Cleared Swap carried through such [FCM], to the extent of such accruals”).

Additionally, Regulation 1.49(e) provides that an FCM “must, as of the close of each
business day, hold in segregated accounts... [s]ufficient United States dollars, held in the
United States, to meet all United States dollar obligations.” 17 C.F.R. § 1.49(e)(1)().

Morgan Stanley’s US Dollar deficits on the numerous days at issue represented US
Dollar obligations to the firm’s cleared swaps customers that were improperly maintained in
non-US Dollar currencies. As of the close of business on each of those days, Morgan Stanley
did not hold sufficient US Dollars in segregated accounts in the United States to meet all of its
US Dollar obligations to its cleared swaps customers. By holding portions of its US Dollar
obligations in other currencies, Morgan Stanley failed to comply with these requirements of
Regulation 1.49. See In the Matter of Interactive Brokers LLC, CFTC Docket No. 13-19 (Apr. 9,
2013) (finding that FCM violated Regulation 1.49(b) and (e) by holding portions of its US Dollar
obligations to futures customer in other currencies, even when the firm had sufficient excess
segregated funds overall). Respondent thereby violated Regulation 22.9(a), 17 C.F.R. § 22.9(a).

B. Failure to Diligently Supervise
Commission Regulation 166.3, 17 C.F.R. § 166.3, requires that —
Each Commission registrant, except an associated person who has no

supervisory duties, must diligently supervise the handling by its partners,
officers, employees and agents (or persons occupying a similar status or

 

* Regulation 22.9 became effective April 9, 2012, and all parties were required to comply by
November 8, 2012. See Protection of Cleared Swaps Customer Contracts and Collateral, 77 Fed.
Reg. 6,336 (Feb. 7, 2012) (codified at 17 C.F.R. pt. 22).

performing a similar function) of all commodity interest accounts carried,
operated, advised or introduced by the registrant and all other activities of
its partners, officers, employees and agents (or persons occupying a
similar status or performing a similar function) relating to its business as a
Commission registrant.

A violation under Regulation 166.3 is an independent violation for which no underlying violation
is necessary. See In re Collins, [1996-1998 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH)
q 27,194 at 45,744 (CFTC Dec. 10, 1997).

A violation of Regulation 166.3 is demonstrated by showing either that (1) the
registrant’s supervisory system was generally inadequate; or (2) the registrant failed to perform
its supervisory duties diligently. In re Murlas Commodities, (1994-1996 Transfer Binder]
Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) ¥ 26,485 at 43,161 (CFTC Sept. 1, 1995); In re GNP Commodities,
Inc., [1990-1992 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) { 25,360 at 39,219 (CFTC
Aug. 11, 1992) (providing that, even if an adequate supervisory system is in place, Regulation
166.3 can still be violated if the supervisory system is not diligently administered), aff'd sub
nom. Monieson v. CFTC, 996 F.2d 852 (7th Cir. 1993); In re Paragon Futures Ass'n, [1990-
1992 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) { 25,266 at 38,850 (CFTC Apr. 1, 1992)
(“The focus of any proceeding to determine whether Rule 166.3 has been violated will be on
whether [a] review [has] occurred and, if it did, whether it was diligent.”); Samson Refining Co.
v. Drexel Burnham Lambert, Inc. [1987-1990 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH)

{ 24,596 at 36,566 (CFTC Feb. 16 1990) (noting that, under Regulation 166.3, an FCM has a
“duty to develop procedures for the detection and deterrence of possible wrongdoing by its
agents”) (internal quotation omitted). Evidence of violations that “should be detected by a
diligent system of supervision, either because of the nature of the violations or because the
violations have occurred repeatedly,” is probative of a failure to supervise. Jn re Paragon
Futures, J 25,266 at 38,850. See in the Matter of Interactive Brokers LLC, CFTC Docket No.
13-19 (Apr. 9, 2013) (finding that firm violated Regulation 166.3 by failing to have procedures
in place to ensure compliance with, among other provisions, the currency denomination
requirements for customer protection under Regulation 1.49).

Throughout the period from November 8, 2012 (the compliance date for the cleared
swaps customer collateral rules) to at least April 8, 2014 (when the violations of Regulation
22.9(a) were discovered), Morgan Stanley did not have procedures in place to ensure compliance
with Regulation 22.9(a), 17 C.F.R. § 22.9(a), and the firm did not train and supervise its
personnel to ensure compliance with this rule. Morgan Stanley thereby failed to supervise
diligently its officers, employees, and agents and did not have sufficient procedures in place to
detect and deter the violations of the Regulations found herein, in violation of Regulation 166.3,
17 C.F.R. § 166.3.
