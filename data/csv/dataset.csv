<h1>CFTC Obtains $2.5 Million Judgment for Fraudulent Solicitation and Misappropriation of Funds From Commodity Pool Participants</h1>

<p style=""margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt""><span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif""><b><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"">Washington, DC â</span></b><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;""> The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois entered a Consent Order for Permanent Injunction on January 8th against defendant <b>Richard D. Carter</b> of Illinois in connection with a $1.76 million commodity pool fraud operated by <b>Blue Guru</b>,<b> LLC</b>.Â Â  </span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt"">Â </p>

<p style=""margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt""><span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"">The order requires Carter to pay restitution totaling $838,642 and a civil monetary penalty of $1,760,022. The order also imposes permanent trading and registration bans on Carter and prohibits him from violating provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act as charged. Th<span style=""color:#1f497d"">e</span> order stems from a CFTC Complaint filed on January 12, 2018 [CFTC Press Release <a href=""https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/pr7672-18"" style=""color:blue; text-decoration:underline"">7672-18</a>], which charged Carter, co-defendant Mark R. Slobodnik, and Blue Guru, LLC with fraud, misappropriation, and failing to register with the CFTC.Â  </span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt"">Â </p>

<p style=""margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt""><span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"">The order finds that from April 2014 to January 2018, Carter willfully misrepresented material facts to Blue Guru pool participants and prospective pool participants concerning the profitability of their participation interests in the commodity pool. Among other misrepresentations, Carter stated that pool funds would be used to trade futures, including the Dow Jones E-mini and the S&amp;P 500 E-mini contracts on the CME, when, in fact, defendants used less than two-thirds of the $1.76 million they received for trading. According to the order, Carter informed prospective participants that they would earn 8% per year on their investment plus 50% of any gross net trading profits, and he issued false account statements reflecting illusory quarterly gains.

THE PARTIES AGREE AND THE COURT HEREBY FINDS:

A. Findings of Fact
The Parties To This Consent Order

14. _ââ Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an independent federal
regulatory agency that is charged by Congress with administering and enforcing the Act and the
Regulations.

15. Defendant Richard D. Carter (âCarterâ) is a resident of Mundelein, Illinois, and
was a senior trader and a principal of Blue Guru. He has never been registered with the
Commission in any capacity. However, Carter was a registered representative with the
Securities Exchange Commission (âSECâ) from 1992 until 2005, when he was barred from
acting as a broker or otherwise associating with any National Association of Securities Dealer
(âNASDâ) member for, among other things, circumventing a heightened supervision plan by
hiding the fact that he was the representative effecting trades on certain customer accounts. Jn re
Carter, NASD No. E8A2004064504 (Dec. 28, 2005) (consent letter). Carterâs registration as a
securities salesperson in Illinois also was revoked by the Illinois Secretary of State Securities
Department in 2006 based on this conduct. Jn re Carter, Ill. Secây of State Sec. Dept. No.
0600133 (July 28, 2006). Carter was also the subject of an SEC fraud action in 2010 for his role
in perpetrating a microcap fraud. In that matter, Carter was ordered to pay a $100,000 fine and
was permanently barred from serving as an officer or director of any entity registered or required
to file reports with the SEC and was further barred from participating in any offer of penny
stock. SEC v. Carter, No. 1:10-cv-06145 (N.D. Ill. Apr. 12, 2012 and Oct. 1, 2012), ECF Nos.

Solicitation of Participants

17. Carter and Slobodnik established Blue Guru in April 2014, and began soliciting
and accepting funds for Blue Guru shortly thereafter.

18. | Blue Guru was structured as a commodity pool (âPoolââ). Prospective and actual
participants were advised that Blue Guru would use their money to trade Dow Jones E-mini
futures and S&P 500 E-mini futures on the CME and distributed a âConfidential Private
Placement Memorandumâ (âPPMâ), which stated that âwe intend to use the proceeds of the
Offering for buying and selling futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.â

19. As described in the PPM, participation interests in the Pool were structured in the
form of 12-month âNotes,â with âthe principal amount will be paid at maturity, unless earlier
redeemed, and interest will be accrued and paid annually . . . at the rate of 8.0% (eight percent)
per annum, with a payout of 50% (fifty-percent) of the gross net profit from trading profits.â

20. The âRisk Factorsâ section of the PPM states âWe currently collaborate with
various trading firms and have developed a proprietary model for trading the financial markets.â
It also states âwe are subject to Commodity Trading regulationsâ and that âwe will be
substantially dependent upon our officers, specifically, Mr. Mark Slobodnik and Mr. Richard
Carter, who have significant experience in our business, to carry out our business plan.â

The âBusinessâ section of the PPM states that âTrades will be made in an Omnibus account and
profits and losses are placed into member accounts on a percentage basis.â

21. Carter solicited relatives, friends, business associates, and others to invest in Blue
Guru by various means, including in-person communication, word-of-mouth, and chat rooms.
Carter did not inform some or all participants or prospective participants that he had been

sanctioned by the SEC, the State of Illinois, and the NASD, and as part of his NASD sanctions, he
OAD A â Prams srmamnt #8: O93 Ear:
ae ae PPE TESS y Tr es io

Bok fd 5 pee ae s

Ca WASROASE PERL GGL TR. Leet PoP AA,

was barred from ever associating with an NASD member or serving as an officer or director of a
securities firm.

22. During solicitations of participants, Carter willfully or recklessly made material
misrepresentations about Blue Guru. Carter falsely told participants and prospective participants
that the funds that they invested would be used to trade commodity futures contracts in a pool
account at a registered FCM located in Chicago (âFCM Aâ). Carter also told participants and
prospective participants that Blue Guruâs strategy was to be flat at the end of each trading day
meaning that there would be little or no risk carried overnight. He also represented that
participantsâ returns were allocated from the Blue Guru pool account at FCM A to separate
participant sub-accounts also carried at FCM A at the end of each trading day.

23. | However, FCM A did not carry any Blue Guru account identified as holding
pooled interests or any sub-accounts for Blue Guru participants.

24. During the Relevant Time, Carter and Slobodnik solicited and _ received
$1,763,848 from thirty-four participants to invest in accordance with a Subscription Agreement
with Blue Guru. Less than two thirds of those funds were used for trading. Some participantsâ
funds were used to pay for the redemptions of others.

25. | Blue Guru maintained four proprietary accounts at FCM A; none was opened as a
pool account, and none was profitable. In aggregate, the four accounts received deposits totaling
$1,100,000, sustained $501,000 in trading losses, paid $62,000 in exchange and clearing fees,
and processed $526,000 in withdrawals, leaving an ending balance of $8,308.09 as of December

31, 2017.

Failure to Trade and Misappropriation of Funds

26. Contrary to the terms of the PPM and Subscription Agreements for Blue Guru,
Carter and Slobodnik did not trade all of the funds that participants invested in Blue Guru, a
portion of which were misappropriated by Carter.

27. Specifically, Carter misappropriated $586,674.25 of participantsâ funds and used
these funds to pay personal expenses, including a down payment on his home, retail purchases,
gym memberships, and restaurant meals.

28. Losses in the four proprietary accounts at FCM A totaled $500,669.92. Carterâs
trading in the four accounts or trades done at Carterâs direction resulted in losses of
$251,968.09. Thus, Carter was responsible for $251,968.09 of the trading losses incurred in the
four accounts. However, Carter advised Blue Guru participants that their funds were earning
consistent trading profits.

29. During the Relevant Time, Carter willfully or recklessly issued or instructed
others to issue false quarterly account statements via email to at least twenty participants in the
Pool that falsely reported the value of participantsâ interests, and falsely reported that the Pool
was increasing in value every quarter when in fact it was not.

30. When participants attempted to withdraw their initial capital or reported profits
from Blue Guru, Carter ignored their demands, engaged in delay tactics, and lied about
conditions that purportedly prevented him from making disbursements. For example, when
certain participants sought to withdraw their funds, Carter told them they would make more
money if they maintained their funds with Blue Guru for even greater returns in the future.
Carter assured one participant that his funds âwere up 10% for the quarterâ when the participant

expressed concern that Carter was not returning his funds upon his request. Carter made this

deliberately false statement at a time that he knew that neither he nor Slobodnik were trading
particpantsâ funds and therefore were producing no returns.
B. Conclusions of Law

Jurisdiction and Venue

31. | This Court possesses jurisdiction over this action pursuant 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1331
(2012) (codifying federal question jurisdiction) and 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1345 (2012) (providing that U.S.
district courts have original jurisdiction over civil actions commenced by the United States or by
any agency expressly authorized to sue by Act of Congress). Section 6c(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
Â§ 13a-1(a) (2012), provides that the Commission may bring actions for injunctive relief or to
enforce compliance with the Act or any rule, regulation, or order thereunder in the proper district
court of the United States whenever it shall appear to the Commission that any person has
engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a violations of any
provision of the Act or any rule, regulation, or order thereunder.

32. | Venue properly lies with this Court pursuant to 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(e), because
Defendant Carter resides in this jurisdiction and the acts and practices in violations of the Act
occurred within this District.

Fraud by Misappropriation and Misrepresentations

33. | By the conduct described above, Carter cheated and defrauded, or attempted to
cheat and defraud, and willfully deceived, or attempted to deceive, participants by, among other
things, willfully or recklessly:

(a) misappropriating participantsâ funds; and
(b) making material misrepresentations and omitting material facts to

prospective and actual participants, including that:
(i) participant funds would be used to trade commodity futures
contracts in a pool account(s) at FCM A;
(ii) participants were earning consistent profits on their investments;
(iii) participants were guaranteed to earn profits of at least 8%, annual
returns and receive 50% of gross net trading profits, when Carter
did not use some or all of participantsâ investments to trade and
had no basis for making these statements; and
(iv) refusing to allow participants to withdraw their funds,
in violations of Section 4b(a)(1)(A) and (C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6b(a)(1)(A), (C) (2012).
Fraud by False Statements
34. By the conduct described above, Carter willfully or recklessly issued or caused to
be issued false quarterly account statements via email to participants in Blue Guru that disguised
his, Slobodnikâs and Blue Guruâs misappropriation of funds and misrepresented the profitability
and value of participantsâ respective interests in Blue Guru in violations of Section 4b(a)(1)(B) of
the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6b(a)(1)(B).

Fraud by a Commodity Pool Operator and Associated Person of a Commodity Pool
Operator

35. By the conduct described above, Blue Guru acted as a commodity pool operator
(âCPOâ) as defined in part by Section la(11)(A)(i)() of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1a(11)(A)G)(D
(2012), in that it engaged in a business that is of the nature of an investment trust, syndicate or
similar form of enterprise operated for the purpose of trading in commodity interests, including
commodity futures, and in connection therewith, solicited, accepted and received funds from

others for the purpose of trading in commodity interests.

10
36. By the conduct described above, Carter acted as an associated person (âAPâ) of
Blue Guru, as defined in part by Regulation 1.3, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.3 (2019), by soliciting funds for
the Pool and handling participant monies while being associated with Blue Guru as a partner,
officer, employee, consultant, or agent (or person occupying a similar status or performing
similar functions).

37. As set forth above, Carter, while acting as an AP of a CPO, and Blue Guru, while
acting as a CPO, defrauded and deceived participants of Blue Guru by using the mails or any
other means of interstate commerce in violations of Section 40(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
Â§ 60(1)(2012) by among other things:

(a) misappropriating participantsâ funds; and
(b) making material misrepresentations and omitting material facts to
prospective and actual participants.

Failure to Register as a CPO

38. | By the conduct described above, Blue Guru engaged in activities as a CPO
without the benefit of registration as a CPO, and in connection therewith used the mails or other
means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce, in violations of Section 4m(1) of the Act,
7 U.S.C. Â§ 6m(1)(2012).

Failure to Register as an AP and Allowing Unregistered APs to Remain Associated
with a CPO

39. By the conduct described above, Carter violated Section 4k(2) of the Act,
7 U.S.C. Â§ 6k(2) (2012), in that he acted as an AP of Blue Guru without the benefit of
registration as an AP of a CPO. By the conduct described above, Blue Guru violated 7 U.S.C.
Â§ 6k(2) of the Act in that, acting as a CPO, it allowed Carter to act as an AP when it knew or

should have known that Carter was not registered as an AP.

Derivative Liability

40. Carter controlled Blue Guru, directly or indirectly, and did not act in good faith or
knowingly induced, directly or indirectly, Blue Guruâs act or acts in violations of the Act; therefore,
pursuant to Section 13(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13c(b) (2012), Carter is liable for Blue Guruâs
violations of 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6b(a)(1)(A)-(C), 6(b)(a)(1)(B), 60(1), 6m(1), and 6(k)(2).

41. Unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, there is a reasonable likelihood that
Carter will continue to engage in the acts and practices alleged in the Complaint and in similar

acts and practices in violations of the Act and Regulations.

IV. PERMANENT INJUNCTION

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT:

42. Based upon and in connection with the foregoing conduct, pursuant to Section 6c
of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2012), Carter is permanently restrained, enjoined and prohibited

(a) in connection with any order to make, or the making of, any contract of
sale of any commodity in interstate commerce or for future delivery that is
made, or to be made, on or subject to the rules of a designated contract
market, for or on behalf of any other person, (A) cheating or defrauding or
attempting to cheat or defraud such other person; (B) willfully making or
causing to be made to such other person any false report or statement, or
willfully entering or causing to be entered for such other person any false
record; or (C) willfully deceiving or attempting to deceive such other
person, in violations of Section 4b(a)(1)(A)-(C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
Â§ 6b(a)(1)(A)-(C) (2012);

(b) â using the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce,
directly or indirectly, as a CPO or an AP of a CPO, to (A) employ any
device, scheme, or artifice to defraud any participant; or (B) engage in any
transaction, practice, or course of business that operates as a fraud or
deceit upon any participant, in violations of Section 40(1) of the Act,
7 U.S.C. Â§ 60(1) (2012);

(c) failing to register as a CPO, in violations of Section 4m(1) of the Act,
7 U.S.C. Â§ 6m(1) (2012); and

Â§ 1a(38) (2012)), registered, exempted from registration or required to be
registered with the Commission except as provided for in Regulation
4.14(a)(9), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 4.14(a)(9) (2019).

V. RESTITUTION AND CIVIL MONETARY PENALTY

44. Defendant Carter shall pay restitution in the amount of eight hundred thirty eight

thousand, six hundred forty two dollars and thirty four cents ($838,642.34) (âRestitution

Obligationâ), representing the customer losses that he caused through trading and

13
misappropriation of participant funds in connection with such violations, plus post-judgment
interest. Post-judgment interest shall accrue on the Restitution Obligation beginning on the date
of entry of this Consent Order and shall be determined by using the Treasury Bill rate prevailing
on the date of entry of this Consent Order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1961 (2012).

45. Defendant Carter is currently the defendant in a criminal action charging him, in
part, for the misconduct that is at issue in this matter. See United States v. Carter, Case No.
1:18-cr-00154 (N.D. Ill. filed May 10, 2018) (âCriminal Actionâ). For amounts disbursed to
participants by Carter as a result of satisfaction of any restitution ordered in the Criminal Action,
Defendant Carter shall receive a  dollar-for-dollar credit against the Restitution
Obligation. Within ten days of disbursement in the Criminal Action to participants paid by
Carter, Carter shall, under a cover letter that identifies the name and docket number of this
proceeding, transmit to the Chief Financial Officer, Commodity Futures Trading Commission,
Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20581, and the Office of
Administration, National Futures Association, 300 South Riverside Plaza, Suite 1800, Chicago,
Illinois 60606, copies of the form of payment to those participants.

46. To effect payment of the Restitution Obligation and the distribution of any
restitution payments to participants by Defendant Carter, the Court appoints the National
Futures Association (âNFAâ) as Monitor (âMonitorâ). The Monitor shall receive restitution
payments from Carter and make distributions as set forth below. Because the Monitor is acting
as an officer of this Court in performing these services, the NFA shall not be liable for any action
or inaction arising from NFAâs appointment as Monitor, other than actions involving fraud.

47. Carter shall make Restitution Obligation payments under this Consent Order to

the Monitor in the name âRichard D. Carter Restitution Fundâ and shall send such Restitution

14
Obligation payments by electronic funds transfer, or by U.S. postal money order, certified check,
bank cashierâs check, or bank money order, to the Office of Administration, National Futures
Association, 300 South Riverside Plaza, Suite 1800, Chicago, Illinois 60606, under cover letter
that identifies the paying Defendant and the name and docket number of this proceeding.
Defendant Carter shall simultaneously transmit copies of the cover letter and the form of
payment to the Chief Financial Officer, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Three
Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20581.

48. The Monitor shall oversee the Restitution Obligation and shall have the discretion
to determine the manner of distribution of such funds in an equitable fashion to participants
identified by the Commission or may defer distribution until such time as the Monitor deems
appropriate. In the event that the amount of Restitution Obligation payments to the Monitor are
of a de minimis nature such that the Monitor determines that the administrative cost of making a
distribution to eligible participants is impractical, the Monitor may, in its discretion, treat such
restitution payments as civil monetary penalty payments, which the Monitor shall forward to the
Commission following the instructions for civil monetary penalty payments set forth in
paragraph 55 below.

49. Carter shall cooperate with the Monitor as appropriate to provide such
information as the Monitor deems necessary and appropriate to identify the participants to whom
the Monitor, in its sole discretion, may determine to include in any plan for distribution of any
Restitution Obligation payments. Carter shall execute any documents necessary to release funds
that he has in any repository, bank, investment or other financial institution, wherever located, in

order to make partial or total payment toward the Restitution Obligation.

Bs)
50. | The Monitor shall provide the Commission at the beginning of each calendar year
with a report detailing the disbursement of funds to Blue Guruâs participants during the previous
year. The Monitor shall transmit this report under a cover letter that identifies the name and
docket number of this proceeding to the Chief Financial Officer, Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20581.

51. The amounts payable to each participant shall not limit the ability of any
participant from proving that a greater amount is owed from Carter or any other person or entity,
and nothing herein shall be construed in any way to limit or abridge the rights of any participant
that exist under state or common law.

52. Pursuant to Rule 71 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, each participant of
Blue Guru who suffered a loss is explicitly made an intended third-party beneficiary of this
Consent Order and may seek to enforce obedience of this Consent Order to obtain satisfaction of
any portion of the restitution that has not been paid by Defendant Carter to ensure continued
compliance with any provision of this Consent Order and to hold Carter in contempt for any
violations of any provision of this Consent Order.

53. To the extent that any funds accrue to the U.S. Treasury for satisfaction of
Carterâs Restitution Obligation, such funds shall be transferred to the Monitor for disbursement
in accordance with the procedures set forth above.

B. Civil Monetary Penalty

54. Carter shall pay a civil monetary penalty in the amount of one million, seven
hundred and sixty thousand, twenty two dollars and seventy five cents ($1,760,022.75) (âCMP
Obligationâ), plus post-judgment interest. Post-judgment interest shall accrue on the CMP

Obligation beginning on the date of entry of this Consent Order and shall be determined by using

16
the Treasury Bill rate prevailing on the date of entry of this Consent Order pursuant to 28 U.S.C.
Â§ 1961 (2012).

55. Carter shall pay his CMP Obligation by electronic funds transfer, U.S. postal
money order, certified check, bank cashierâs check, or bank money order. If payment is to be
made other than by electronic funds transfer, then the payment shall be made payable to the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission and sent to the address below:

simultaneously transmit copies of the cover letter and the form of payment to the Chief Financial
Officer, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street,
NW, Washington, D.C. 20581.

C. Provisions Related to Monetary sanctions

56. Partial Satisfaction: Acceptance by the Commission or the Monitor of any partial
payment of Carterâs Restitution Obligation or CMP Obligation shall not be deemed a waiver of
his obligation to make further payments pursuant to this Consent Order, or a waiver of the

Commissionâs right to seek to compel payment of any remaining balance.

ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO SECTION 6(c) AND (d) OF
THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, MAKING FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING
REMEDIAL sanctions

I. INTRODUCTION

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionââ) has reason to believe that
from December 2014 to April 2016 (âRelevant Periodâ), Daewoo Securities Co. Ltd. (âDaewoo
Securitiesâ), subsequently acquired by Mirae Asset Securities (now known as Mirae Asset
Daewoo Co., Ltd.) (âRespondentâ or âMiraeââ) after the Relevant Period, violated
Section 4c(a)(5)(C) of the Commodity Exchange Act (âActâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6c(a)(5)(C) (2012).
Therefore, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest that public
administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted to determine whether Daewoo
Securities engaged in the violations set forth herein and to determine whether any order should
be issued imposing remedial sanctions.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Mirae has submitted an
Offer of Settlement (âOfferâ), which the Commission has determined to accept. Without
admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, Mirae consents to the entry of
this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Section 6(c) and (d) of the Commodity Exchange
Act, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial sanctions (âOrderâ), and acknowledges service
of this Order.â

 

' Respondent consents to the use of the findings of fact and conclusions of law in this Order in this proceeding and
in any other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party or claimant, and agrees
that they shall be taken as true and correct and be given preclusive effect therein, without further proof. Respondent
does not consent, however, to the use of this Order, or the findings or conclusions herein, as the sole basis for any
other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party or claimant, other than: a
proceeding in bankruptcy or receivership; or a proceeding to enforce the terms of this Order. Respondent does not
consent to the use of the Offer or this Order, or the findings or conclusions in this Order, by any other party in any
other proceeding.
Il. FINDINGS
The Commission finds the following:
A. SUMMARY

During the Relevant Period, Daewoo Securities, which Mirae later acquired, by and
through one of its traders (âTrader Aâ), engaged in the disruptive trading practice of âspoofingâ
(i.e., bidding or offering with the intent to cancel the bid or offer before execution) in the E-mini
S&P 500 Index futures contract (the âE-Miniâ) traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
(âCMEâ), a designated contract market owned and operated by CME Group Inc. The disruptive
trading violated Section 4c(a)(5)(C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6c(a)(5)(C) (2012).

In accepting the Offer, the Commission recognizes Miraeâs cooperation during the
Division of Enforcementâs (âDivisionâ) investigation of this matter. The Commission
specifically notes that Miraeâs cooperation is being recognized in the form of a reduced civil
monetary penalty.

B. RESPONDENT

Mirae Asset Daewoo Co., Ltd., formerly known as Mirae Asset Securities Co. Ltd.,
which acquired Daewoo Securities after the Relevant Period, is a brokerage and investment
banking firm in the Republic of Korea (âKoreaâ). During the Relevant Period, Daewoo
Securities engaged in proprietary futures contract trading in the United States through traders,
including Trader A, in its Seoul office.

OF FACTS
1, Daewoo Securitiesâ Spoofing

During the Relevant Period, Daewoo Securities employed Trader A in Seoul, Korea.
Trader Aâs duties included placing orders for futures contracts, including the E-Mini contract, on
the CME. During the Relevant Period, on behalf of Daewoo Securities and within the scope of
his employment at Daewoo Securities, Trader A placed numerous orders for the E-Mini contract
with the intent to cancel those orders before execution.

One strategy Trader A employed involved three steps. First, Trader A entered one or
more disproportionally large ordersâthat he intended to cancelâon one side of the market (the
âSpoof Orderâ). Trader A placed the Spoof Orders with the intention of giving a misleading
impression of market depth and inducing other market participants to trade opposite the orders.
Second, capitalizing on the increased buying or selling interest that the Spoof Orders created,
Trader A placed a small orderâthat he intended to executeâon the opposite side of the market
(the âGenuine Orderâ). Third, within seconds of the Genuine Order being filled, Trader A
cancelled the Spoof Order before it was filled.
2. Miraeâs Cooperation

Immediately upon learning of the Divisionâs investigation into conduct engaged in by an
employee of Daewoo Securities, which Mirae had acquired, Mirae began cooperating with the
Divisionâs investigation. As part of that cooperation, Mirae voluntarily produced documents and
provided important information and analysis at the Divisionâs request. In addition, Mirae hired
U.S. counsel to conduct an internal review, which included reviewing documents and
interviewing and meeting with more than a dozen Mirae Representatives in Seoul. Also as part
of its review, Mirae hired an expert to analyze Trader Aâs trading activity. Mirae completed its
investigation and data analysis in a timely fashion, which expedited the completion of the
Divisionâs investigation.

Due to Miraeâs cooperation, the civil monetary penalty imposed by the Commission has
been reduced from the otherwise applicable penalty.

IU. LEGAL DISCUSSION
A. Spoofing in violations of Section 4c(a)(5)(C) of the Act

Section 4c(a)(5)(C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6c(a)(5)(C) (2012), makes it unlawful for
âTa|ny person to engage in any trading, practice, or conduct on or subject to the rules of a
registered entity that .. . is, is of the character of, or is commonly known to the trade as,
âspoofingâ (bidding or offering with the intent to cancel the bid or offer before execution).â See
also United States v. Coscia, 866 F3d 782, 792-93 (7th Cir. 2017) (holding that because the Act
clearly defines spoofing, it provides adequate notice of prohibited conduct), cert denied, 138 S.
Ct. 1989 (2018). As described above, Daewoo Securities, by and through Trader A, entered bids
or offers on a registered entity with the intent to cancel the bids or offers before execution in
violations of Section 4c(a)(5)(C) of the Act.

B. Mirae Is Vicariously Liable for the Acts of Daewoo Securities, Which It Acquired
After the Relevant Period

Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(a)(1)(B) (2012), and Commission Regulation
(âRegulationâ) 1.2, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.2 (2019), provide that the act, omission, or failure of any
official, agent, or other person acting for any individual, association, partnership, corporation, or
trust within the scope of his or her employment or office shall be deemed the act, omission, or
failure of such individual, association, partnership, corporation, or trust. Principals are strictly
liable for the actions of their agents under Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act and Regulation 1.2. See
Dohmen-Ramirez v. CFTC, 837 F.2d 847, 857-58 (9th Cir. 1988); Rosenthal & Co. v. CFTC,
802 F.2d 963, 966-67 (7th Cir. 1986); CFTC v. Byrnes, 58 F. Supp. 3d 319, 324 (S.D.N.Y.
2014).

Trader A engaged in the conduct described herein within the scope of his employment
with Daewoo Securities, which was subsequently acquired by Mirae; therefore, pursuant to
Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act and Regulation 1.2, Mirae, as successor to Daewoo Securities, is
liable for Trader Aâs acts, omissions, and failures in violations of Section 4c(a)(5)(C) of the Act.
A,

B.

assigns, agents or employees under its authority or control shall take any action or
make any public statement on behalf of Respondent denying, directly or
indirectly, any findings or conclusions in this Order or creating, or tending to
create, the impression that this Order is without a factual basis; provided,
however, that nothing in this provision shall affect Respondentâs: (i) testimonial
obligations; or (ii) right to take legal positions in other proceedings to which the
Commission is not a party. Respondent and its successors and assigns shall
comply with this agreement, and shall undertake all steps necessary to ensure that
all of its agents and/or employees under its authority or control understand and
comply with this agreement.

Cooperation, in General: Respondent shall cooperate fully and expeditiously with
the Commission, including the Division, in this action, and in any current or
future Commission investigation or action related thereto. Respondent shall also
cooperate with the Commission in any investigation, civil litigation, or
administrative matter related to, or arising from, the subject matter of this action.
As part of such cooperation, Respondent agrees to do the following for a period of
two years from the date of the entry of this Order, or until all related
investigations and litigation are concluded, including through the appellate review
process, whichever period is longer:

1. Preserve all records relating to the subject matter of this proceeding,
including, but not limited to, audio files, electronic mail, other
communications, and trading records;

li. Subject to applicable laws and regulations, comply fully, promptly,
completely, and truthfully with all inquiries or requests for information

materials, execute affidavits or declarations, and provide a corporate
representative to testify completely and truthfully at depositions, trial, and
other judicial proceedings, when requested to do so by Division Staff;

6
iv. Subject to applicable laws and regulations, use its best efforts to produce
any current (as of the time of the request) officer, director, employee, or
agent of Respondent, regardless of the individualâs location and at such a
location that minimizes Commission travel expenditures, to provide
assistance at any trial, proceeding, or Commission investigation related to
the subject matter of this proceeding, including but not limited to, requests
for testimony, depositions, and/or interviews, and to encourage them to
testify completely and truthfully in any such proceeding, trial, or
investigation; and

V. Subject to applicable laws and regulations, use its best efforts to assist in
locating and contacting any prior (as of the time of the request) officer,
director, employee, or agent of Respondent.

3. Partial Satisfaction: Respondent understands and agrees that any acceptance by
the Commission of any partial payment of Respondentâs CMP Obligation shall
not be deemed a waiver of its obligation to make further payments pursuant to this
Order, or a waiver of the Commissionâs right to seek to compel payment of any
remaining balance.

4. Change of Address/Phone: Until such time as Respondent satisfies in full its
CMP Obligation as set forth in this Order, Respondent shall provide written
notice to the Commission by certified mail of any change to its telephone number
and mailing address within ten calendar days of the change.

The provisions of this Order shall be effective as of this date.

ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTION 6(c) AND (d) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT,
MAKING FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL sanctions

OL INTRODUCTION

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ) has reason to believe that
from at least July 2012 through March 2017 (âRelevant Periodâ), Propex Derivatives Pty Ltd.
(âPropexâ) violated Section 4c(a)(5)(C) of the Commodity Exchange Act (âActâ), 7 U.S.C.

Â§ 6c(a)(5)(C) (2018). Therefore, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest
that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted to determine whether Propex
engaged in the violations set forth herein and to determine whether any order should be issued
imposing remedial sanctions.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Propex has submitted an
Offer of Settlement (âOfferâ), which the Commission has determined to accept. Without
admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, except to the extent that Propex
admits those findings in any related action against Propex by, or any agreement with, the United
States Department of Justice (âDOJâ) or any other governmental agency or office, Propex
consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Section 6(c) and (d) of the
Commodity Exchange Act, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial sanctions (âOrderââ), and
acknowledges service of this Order.â

 

' Propex consents to the use of the findings of fact and conclusions of law in this Order in this proceeding and in any
other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party or claimant, and agrees that
they shall be taken as true and correct and be given preclusive effect therein, without further proof. Propex does not
consent, however, to the use of this Order, or the findings or conclusions herein, as the sole basis for any other
proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party or claimant, other than: a proceeding
in bankruptcy or receivership; or a proceeding to enforce the terms of this Order. Propex does not consent to the use
of the Offer or this Order, or the findings or conclusions in this Order, by any other party in any other proceeding.

1
I. FINDINGS
The Commission finds the following:
A. SUMMARY

During the Relevant Period, Propex, by and through a Propex trader (âTrader Aâ),
engaged in thousands of instances of the disruptive trading practice known as âspoofingâ
(bidding or offering with the intent to cancel the bid or offer before execution) in the E-mini
S&P 500 futures contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (âCMEâ), a futures
exchange and designated contract market which is owned and operated by CME Group Inc. This
conduct violated Section 4c(a)(5)(C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6c(a)(5)(C) (2018).

B. RESPONDENT

Propex Derivatives Pty Ltd. is a proprietary trading firm headquartered in Australia.
Trader A traded on behalf of Propex for approximately nine yearsâa time period covering all of
the spoofing conduct described herein. Propex has never been registered with the Commission.

Cc. FACTS
1. Spoofing

During the Relevant Period, Trader A engaged in proprietary trading in commodity
futures markets on behalf of Propex. On thousands of occasions during the Relevant Period,
Trader A placed bids and offers for E-mini S&P 500 futures contracts with the intent to cancel
the bids and offers before execution. Trader Aâs spoofing activity involved the placement of one
or more orders that Trader A wanted to get filled (âGenuine Order(s)â), on one side of the
market, typically consisting of one or more passive orders for fewer than fifty contracts
collectively; and on the opposite side of the market, placement of one or more orders that Trader
A intended to cancel before execution (âSpoof Order(s)â), typically consisting of one or more
passive orders for, collectively, five times as many contracts as the Genuine Order(s). Generally,
Trader A canceled the Spoof Order(s) shortly after placing them, and often after his Genuine
Order(s) were filled.

Trader A traded in Propexâs trading accounts and shared trading profits with Propex.
Trader Aâs spoofing benefitted Propex financially while also inflicting harm on the markets and
other market participants, causing $464,300 in market losses.

2. Remediation

Propex represents that since this conduct occurred it has engaged in remedial efforts.
Among other things, Propex retained an independent consultant in March 2018 to review its
policies and procedures and updated those policies following the consultantâs recommendations;
developed and implemented an automated trade surveillance system, which includes surveillance
for manipulative and deceptive trading such as spoofing; assigned an experienced, senior
executive to review automated trade surveillance alerts; and established periodic compliance
training for all traders, as well as Propexâs leadership.

Ul LEGAL DISCUSSION
A. Spoofing in violations of Section 4c(a)(5)(C) of the Act

Section 4c(a)(5)(C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6c(a)(5)(C) (2018), makes it unlawful for
âTalny person to engage in any trading, practice, or conduct on or subject to the rules of a
registered entity that .. . is, is of the character of, or is commonly known to the trade as,
âspoofingâ (bidding or offering with the intent to cancel the bid or offer before the execution).â
See, e.g., United States v. Coscia, 866 F.3d 782, 792-93 (7th Cir. 2017) (holding that because the
Act clearly defines spoofing, it provides adequate notice of prohibited conduct), cert denied,
138 S. Ct. 1989 (2018).

As described above, during the Relevant Period, Propex, by and through the acts of
Trader A, placed bids and offers for futures contracts listed on CME, a registered entity, with the
intent to cancel those bids and offers before they were executed. By engaging in this conduct,
Propex violated Section 4c(a)(5)(C) of the Act. See CFTC v. Oystacher, 203 F. Supp. 3d 934,
942 (N.D. Ill. 2016) (denying motion for judgment on the pleadings, holding that allegations of
placing âboth bids and offers with the intent to cancel those bids or offers before executionâ
constitutes âtrading behavior [that] falls within the Spoofing Statuteâs defined prohibitionâ).

B. Propex Is Liable for the Acts of Its Agent

Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(a)(1)(B) (2018), and Regulation 1.2,
17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.2 (2019), provide that â[t]he act, omission, or failure of any official, agent, or other
person acting for any individual, association, partnership, corporation, or trust within the scope
of his employment or office shall be deemed the act, omission, or failure of such individual,
association, partnership, corporation, or trust.â Pursuant to Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act and
Regulation 1.2, strict liability is imposed on principals for the actions of their agents. See, e.g.,
Dohmen-Ramirez & Wellington Advisory, Inc. v. CFTC, 837 F.2d 847, 857-58 (9th Cir. 1988);
Rosenthal & Co. v. CFTC, 802 F.2d 963, 966 (7th Cir. 1986); CFTC v. Byrnes, 58 F. Supp. 3d
319, 324 (S.D.N.Y. 2014).

Trader A engaged in the conduct described herein within the scope of his agency with
Propex; therefore, pursuant to Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act and Regulation 1.2, Propex is liable
for those acts, omissions, and failures in violations of the provisions of the Act and Regulations
cited above.

IV. FINDINGS OF violations

Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that, during the Relevant Period, Propex
violated Section 4c(a)(5)(C), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6c(a)(5)(C) (2018).

The Restitution Obligation will be offset by the amount of any restitution payment made
pursuant to the DPA. Propex shall provide proof of any payment under the DPA,

Kansas City, MO 64112

The Commission appoints the National Futures Association (âNFAâ) to receive payments
of restitution and any post-judgment interest from Propex and handle the distribution of
payments to any persons designated to receive restitution. As provided in the DPA, DOJ
will serve as the claims administrator with respect to the restitution payment received
pursuant to the DPA and shall have sole discretion to determine how the restitution
payment will be disbursed. The NFA shall receive such payment into an account
designated the âPropex Victim Compensation Settlement Fund.â Because the NFA is not
being specially compensated for these services, and these services are outside the normal
duties of the NFA, it shall not be liable for any action or inaction arising from its
appointment in this matter other than actions involving fraud.

Propex shall pay a civil monetary penalty in the amount of four hundred sixty-two
thousand, two hundred seventy-one dollars ($462,271), plus post-judgment interest
(âCMP Obligationâ). Post-judgment interest shall accrue on the CMP Obligation
beginning on the date following entry of this Order and shall be determined by using the
Treasury Bill rate prevailing on the date of the entry of this Order pursuant to 28 U.S.C.
Â§ 1961.

Propex shall satisfy the CMP Obligation by making payments as follows: $154,091 to be
paid within one year of the entry of this Order; $154,090 to be paid within two years of
the entry of this Order; and $154,090 to be paid within three years of the entry of this
Order. Payments shall be deemed made on the date they are received by the Commission
or DOJ. Post-judgment interest will be waived for any amounts paid in compliance with
the above deadlines.

The CMP Obligation will be offset by the amount of any criminal monetary penalty paid
pursuant to the DPA. Propex shall provide (to the persons and addresses listed below)
proof of any payment under the DPA, including the case name(s) and number(s) in
connection with which such payment has been made, and the amount by which the CMP
Obligation is to be reduced, within ten days of making such payment.
Propex shall pay any portion of the CMP Obligation that has not been offset and any
post-judgment interest by electronic funds transfer, U.S. postal money order, certified
check, bank cashierâs check, or bank money order. If payment is to be made other than
by electronic funds transfer, the payment shall be made payable to the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission and sent to the address below:

agents, or employees under its authority or control shall take any action or make
any public statement denying, directly or indirectly, any findings or conclusions
in this Order or creating, or tending to create, the impression that this Order is
without a factual basis; provided, however, that nothing in this provision shall
affect Propexâs: (i) testimonial obligations; or (ii) right to take legal positions in
other proceedings to which the Commission is not a party. Propex and its
successors and assigns shall comply with this Order, and shall undertake all steps
necessary to ensure that all of its agents and/or employees under its authority or
control understand and comply with this agreement.

2, Disgorgement: Propex agrees to pay disgorgement in the amount of seventy-three
thousand, four hundred twenty-nine dollars ($73,429) (âDisgorgement
Obligationâ), plus post-judgment interest, according to the payment terms above.
Post-judgment interest shall accrue on the Disgorgement Obligation beginning on

Propex shall pay any portion of the Disgorgement Obligation that has not been
offset and any post-judgment interest by electronic funds transfer, U.S. postal
money order, certified check, bank cashierâs check, or bank money order. If
payment is to be made other than by electronic funds transfer, the payment should
be made payable to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and sent to the
address below:

Order, the entire outstanding balance of the CMP Obligation and Disgorgement

Cooperation with the Commission: Propex shall cooperate fully and
expeditiously with the Commission, including the Division, in this action and in

other judicial proceedings, when requested to do so by Division staff;

d. Use its best efforts to produce any current (as of the time of the request)
officer, director, employee, or agent of Propex, regardless of the

travel expenditures, to provide assistance at any trial, proceeding, or
Commission investigation related to the subject matter of this proceeding,

director, employee, or agent of Propex.

Partial Satisfaction. Propex understands and agrees that any acceptance by the
Commission of partial satisfaction of Propexâs Restitution Obligation, CMP
Obligation, or Disgorgement Obligation shall not be deemed a waiver of its
obligation to make further payments pursuant to this Order or a waiver of the
Commissionâs right to seek to compel payment of any remaining balance.

Change of Address: Until such time as Propex satisfies in full its Restitution
Obligation, CMP Obligation, and Disgorgement Obligation as set forth in this
Order, Propex shall provide written notice to the Commission by certified mail of
any change to its telephone number and mailing address within ten days of the
change.
7. Remediation: As set forth above, Propex represents that it has already undertaken
and continues to undertake remedial measures to enhance its policies, procedures,

The provisions of this Order shall be effective as of this date.

By the Commission.

White pooled the participantsâ funds in his personal bank and trading accounts and deposited only a portion of the pooled funds into commodity interest trading accounts. From 2014 to 2018, White traded pool participantsâ funds in two commodity interest accounts, both in his own name. In the first account, there were at least 31 months in which no trading occurred, and the account was closed with a total cumulative loss of $687. In the second account, opened in April 2018, trading occurred in only one month and ended with a cumulative loss of $308.</span></span></span></p>

For example, White failed to disclose that his trading had actually resulted in a net loss and that the highest monthly profit he had earned was roughly $934. Additionally, White created and delivered monthly account statements to at least two pool participants, which falsely represented that he engaged in trading every month, that his trading was profitable, and that participants were earning positive returns on their deposits.</span></span></span></p>

This amount was far greater than any commissions that White and MWGF could have claimed on the minor, sporadic profits generated by his trading.</span></span></span></p>

ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTION 6(c) AND (d) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, MAKING
FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL sanctions

I. INTRODUCTION

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ) has reason to believe that
during the period of at least February 2014 through July 2018 (âRelevant Periodâ), Matthew R.
White (âWhiteâ) and M.W. Global Futures LLC (ââMWGFââ) (together, âââRespondentsââ) violated
Sections 4b(a)(1), 4m(1), and 40(1) of the Commodity Exchange Act (âActâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§
6b(a)(1), 6m(1), 60(1) (2012), and that White also violated Section 4k(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
Â§ 6k(2) (2012). Therefore, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest that
public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted to determine whether White and
MWGEF engaged in the violations set forth herein and to determine whether any order should be
issued imposing remedial sanctions.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Respondents have
submitted an Offer of Settlement (âOfferâ), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Without admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, except to the extent that
Respondent White admits those findings in connection with any agreement with the United States
Attorneyâs Office for the Western District of Washington, Respondents consent to the entry of this
Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Section 6(c) and (d) of the Commodity Exchange Act,
Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial sanctions (âOrderâ) and acknowledge service of this
Order,

 

' Respondents consent to the use of the findings of fact and conclusions of law in this Order in this proceeding and
in any other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party or claimant, and agrees
that they shall be taken as true and correct and be given preclusive effect therein, without further proof.

Respondents do not consent, however, to the use of this Order, or the findings or conclusions herein, as the sole
basis for any other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party or claimant, other
than: a proceeding in bankruptcy or receivership; or a proceeding to enforce the terms of this Order. Respondents
do not consent to the use of the Offer or this Order, or the findings or conclusions in this Order, by any other party in
any other proceeding.
Il. FINDINGS

The Commission finds the following:
A. SUMMARY

White, individually from at least February 2014 to October 2017, and MWGF, from
October 2017 to July 2018 by and through the actions of White, violated Sections 4b(a)(1) and
4o(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6b(a)(1), 60(1) (2012), by fraudulently soliciting, receiving and
holding approximately $1.284 million for a pooled investment vehicle trading commodity futures
contracts. In doing so, White acted as an unregistered commodity pool operator (âCPOâ).
Beginning in October 2017, MWGEF, by and through White, acted as an unregistered CPO and
White acted as an unregistered Associated Person (âAPâ) of MWGF. Thus, White and MWGF
violated Section 4m(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6m(1) (2012), and White violated Section 4k(2) of
the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6k(2) (2012).

In accepting Respondentsâ Offer, the Commission recognizes the Respondentsâ
cooperation with the Division of Enforcementâs (âDivisionâ) investigation of this matter and
notes that Respondentsâ cooperation is reflected in the form of a reduced civil monetary penalty.

B. RESPONDENTS

Matthew R. White resides in Cocoa Beach, Florida. He has never been registered with
the Commission in any capacity.

M.W. Global Futures LLC was a Florida limited liability company formed in March
2015 with its principal place of business in Tampa, Florida. White was the sole officer,
employee, or agent of MWGF. MWGEF was dissolved in January 2019. MWGEF has never been
registered with the Commission in any capacity.

Cc. FACTS

During the Relevant Period, White and MWGEF solicited, received and held
approximately $1.284 million from six individuals (âpool participantsâ) residing in Florida and
Washington for the purpose of trading commodity futures contracts, including U.S. Treasury
futures contracts trading on a designated contract market operated by CME Group Inc. From
October 2017 to July 2018, White solicited and received funds from at least one participant in the
name of MWGF. The pool participants consisted of Whiteâs family members and acquaintances.
White pooled the participantsâ funds in his personal bank and trading accounts. White deposited
only a portion of the pooled funds into commodity interest trading accounts.

From 2014 to 2018, White traded in two commodity interest accounts, both in his own
name. The first account was opened in February 2014 with a registered Futures Commission
Merchant (âFCMâ), FCM A. In this account, White deposited a total of approximately $91,500

2
in pool participant funds From February 2014 to May 2018, there were at least thirty-one
months in which White did no trading in the account held at FCM A. The account was closed in
May 2018 with a total cumulative loss of $687 through trading and fees.

In April 2018, White opened an account at FCM B and deposited, via wire transfer from
his personal bank account, a total of $112,000 in pool participant funds. He engaged in trading
in this account in only one month and ended with a cumulative loss of $308 through trading and
fees. The account was closed in September 2018.

During the Relevant Period, White made false or misleading statements to prospective
and current pool participants, and omitted material facts, regarding the profitability of his
commodity futures trading. For example, in October 2017, during both a telephone call and an
in-person meeting to solicit Participant A to invest with MWGF, White stated that his futures
trading had been very successful and that Participant A could expect returns of 12% per month.
In the same month, White also sent to Participant A by U.S. Mail promotional materials that
represented the average annual return on investment for MWGF was 16.25%. White failed to
disclose that, in fact, from February 2014 through September 2017 his trading had resulted in a
net loss and the highest monthly profit he had earned was $93.70 in a trading account holding
approximately $64,000. The promotional material stated that MWGF âcharges a flat commission
rate of 20% with no commission charge if there is a losing month.â The promotional material
included a purported client account statement which indicated that trading occurred on the
majority of days in August 2016, the client earned a total monthly profit of over $4,800, and the
client paid over $1,200 as commission to MWGF. White omitted the material fact that White
actually engaged in no trading in August 2016 and earned no profits. Finally, the promotional
material also falsely represented that White was a member of the Chicago Board of Trade
(âCBOTâ). Whiteâs misrepresentations and omissions induced participants to deposit and
continue to maintain investment funds with White and MWGF.

White created and delivered to at least two pool participants, via email and U.S. Mail,
monthly account statements which falsely represented that he engaged in trading every month,
his trading was profitable, and the participants were earning positive returns on their investments.
In fact, White engaged in trading during only thirty-seven of the fifty-eight months his two
trading accounts were open, produced only minimal profits, and ended with a net loss in both of
his accounts. In monthly statements for months in which White did trade, he significantly
inflated the amount of profits earned. For example, White mailed an April 2018 monthly
statement that showed Participant A earned $3,311.44, when Whiteâs total trading that month
earned a net profit of just $31.25. The false account statements, which led pool participants to
believe that their investments were earning substantial profits, induced at least two participants to
deposit additional funds with White and MWGFE.

During the Relevant Period, White used means or instrumentalities of interstate
commerce in connection with his and MWGFâs business as CPOs. White communicated with
current and prospective pool participants via email and telephone; collected funds from pool
participants by check, ACH, or wire transfer; transferred pool funds between an MWGF bank
account, his personal bank account, and his personal trading accounts via ACH and wire transfer;
and delivered monthly account statements to pool participants via email and U.S. Mail.

we
Of the approximately $1.284 million collected from pool participants, MWGF and White
repaid over $400,000 and lost a total of $995 in his two trading accounts through trading or
trading fees. During the Divisionâs investigation, White repaid an additional $602,000 to pool
participants. White misappropriated $281,970.97 in pool participant funds and diverted most of
them for personal expenses, such as credit card payments, auto loan payments, and rent
payments. This amount was far greater than any commissions that White and MWGF could have
claimed on the minor, sporadic profits generated by Whiteâs trading.

During the course of the Divisionâs investigation, Respondent White cooperated with the
Divisionâs investigations. White voluntarily provided supplementary documents and summaries
relating to his activities and proactively identified key information to the Division, including
providing the Division a complete list of pool participants (several of which the Division had not
yet identified), their locations, and an accounting of the amounts and dates of their deposits and
withdrawals. White also voluntarily produced several years of monthly statements for his
personal bank accounts, thus streamlining the Divisionâs investigation. Whiteâs cooperation
resulted in material assistance to the Divisionâs investigation and saved the Division considerable
time and resources in carrying out its investigation.

Il. LEGAL DISCUSSION
A. White and MWGF Violated Section 4b(a)(1) of the Act

During the Relevant Period, in connection with commodity futures transactions made or
to be made on or subject to the rules of a designated contract market, for or on behalf of others
who provided funds to the Respondents for the purpose of trading commodity futures, White
cheated, defrauded, or attempted to cheat or defraud such persons in regard to orders or contracts
or the disposition or execution of orders or contracts, or in regards to any act of agency
performed by White with respect to such orders or contracts, in violations of Section 4b(a)(1)(A)-
(C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6b(a)(1)(A)-(C) (2012). To establish liability for fraud, the
Commission must prove: â(1) the making of a misrepresentation, misleading statement, or a
deceptive omission; (2) scienter; and (3) materiality.â CFTC v. R.J. Fitzgerald & Co., 310 F.3d
1321, 1328 (11th Cir. 2002). Scienter is met when respondentâs conduct involves âhighly
unreasonable omissions or misrepresentations . . . that present a danger of misleading
[customers] which is either known to the [respondent] or so obvious that [respondent] must have
been aware of it.â Jd. âA representation or omission is âmaterialâ if a reasonable investor would
consider it important in deciding whether to make an investment.â Jd. at 1328-29.
Misappropriation of customersâ monies also violates Section 4b of the Act. See In re Slusser,
CFTC No. 94-14, 1999 WL 507574, at *12 (July 19, 1999) (affirming finding that respondents
violated Section 4b of the Act by surreptitiously retaining money in their own bank accounts
what should have been traded on behalf of the investors), aff'd in relevant part sub nom. Slusser
v. CFTC, 210 F.3d 783 (7th Cir. 2000); CFTC v. Morse, 762 F.2d 60, 62 (8th Cir. 1985)
(recognizing that defendantâs use of customer funds for personal expenses violated Section 4b of
the Act).

During the Relevant Period, White made affirmative misrepresentations to prospective
and current pool participants regarding his trading, performance history, and profitability and
failed to disclose the actual results of his trading. White touted his trading success in at least one

4
conversation with a prospective pool participant. White created and delivered to pool
participants promotional material and monthly account statements that falsely represented pooled
funds were being successfully traded and that participantsâ investments were earning generally
consistent and positive monthly returns. In fact, White did not deposit all of the pool
participantsâ funds into trading accounts, he did not trade in every month, he did not have
positive returns in every month that he traded, and overall his accounts suffered net losses.
Whiteâs false representations and omissions regarding his trading and trading results were
material because a reasonable investor would find them important in making an investment
decision. See CFTC v. Noble Wealth, 90 F.Supp.2d 676, 686-687 (D. Md. 2000) (âIndeed,
misrepresentations concerning profit and risk go to the heart of a customerâs investment decision
and are therefore material as a matter of law.â (citation omitted)). Additionally, White
misappropriated pooled funds for personal and non-trading related expenses and failed to
disclose his misappropriations.

White acted with scienter because he conducted all trading of the pooled funds and had
access to trading statements for his commodity interest accounts. White was necessarily aware
that his trading was not successful every month that he traded, the monthly profits earned were
very small, and that his accounts suffered net losses. White knew or recklessly disregarded the
fact that his oral and written representations to the contrary were false. Thus, White violated
Section 4b(a)(1) of the Act.

From October 2017 to July 2018, White engaged in the foregoing acts within the scope of
his employment, office, or agency with MWGF. Therefore, pursuant to Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the
Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(a)(1)(B) (2012), and Commission Regulation (âRegulationâ) 1.2, 17 C.F.R. Â§
1.2 (2018), MWGF is liable for Whiteâs violations of Section 4b(a)(1).

B. White and MWGF Violated Section 40(1) of the Act

White, individually from at least February 2014 to October 2017, and MWGF, from
October 2017 through July 2018 by and through the actions of White, acted as CPOs by
soliciting, accepting, or receiving funds from participants in a pooled investment trust, syndicate,
or similar form of enterprise and for the purpose of trading in commodity interests, including
U.S. Treasury futures. See Section la(11) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1a(11) (2012). From October
2017 to July 2018, White acted as an AP of a CPO by soliciting and collecting funds from
prospective pool participants and trading commodity futures contracts with the pooled
investment funds. See Section 4k(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6k(2) (2012).

Section 40(1)(A) and (B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 60(1)(A), (B) (2012), makes it unlawful
for a CPO or an AP of a CPO, by the use of the mails or any instrumentality of interstate
commerce, directly or indirectly, to employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud any client
or participant or prospective client or participant, or to engage in any transaction, practice, or
course of business which operates as a fraud or deceit upon any pool participant or prospective
pool participant. Section 40(1)(A) and (B) prohibits both registered and unregistered CPOs from
making misrepresentations or omissions regarding futures transactions. Cf In re R&W Tech.
Servs., Ltd., CFTC No. 96-3, 1999 WL 152619 (Mar. 16, 1999) (prohibiting fraud by an
unregistered CTA who sold trading systems to the public), aff'd in relevant part, R&W Tech.
Servs., Ltd. v. CFTC, 205 F.3d 165, 170 (Sth Cir. 2000).

5
The same conduct that constitutes violations of Section 4b(a)(1)(A) and (B) of the Act, as
described above, also constitutes violations of Section 4o(1) of the Act. See, e.g., CFTC v
Skorupskas, 605 F. Supp. 923, 932-33 (E.D. Mich. 1985). However, proof of scienter is not
required under Section 40(1)(B) of the Act. In re Kolter, CFTC No. 93-19, 1994 WL 621595, at
*7 (Nov. 8, 1994). While using the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, namely the US.
Mail, email messages, and electronic bank transactions, White, acting as a CPO and, from
October 2017 to July 2018, as an AP of a CPO, knowingly or recklessly made false statements of
material fact to prospective and current pool participants, sent false statements to pool
participants, and misappropriated pool funds. Thus, White violated Section 40(1) of the Act.

From October 2017 to July 2018, White engaged in the foregoing acts within the scope of
his employment, office, or agency with MWGF. Therefore, pursuant to Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the
Act and Regulation 1.2, MWGF is liable for Whiteâs violations.

C. White and MWGE Violated Section 4m(1) of the Act

Section 4m(l) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6m(1) (2012), makes it unlawful for any CPO to use
the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce in connection with the CPOâs
business, without being registered with the Commission, subject to certain exceptions and
exemptions not relevant here. Section la(11) of the Act defines a CPO, in relevant part, as any
person âengaged in a business that is of the nature of a commodity pool, investment trust,
syndicate, or similar form of enterprise, and who, in connection therewith, solicits, accepts, or
receives from others, funds, securities, or property . . . for the purpose of trading in commodity
interests.â

As described above, White, individually from at least February 2014 to October 2017,
and MWGF, from October 2017 to July 2018 by and through the actions of White, acted as
CPOs and used means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce in connection with their CPO
business by soliciting and collecting over $1.284 million from six persons for a pooled
investment vehicle to trade U.S. Treasury futures contracts on a designated contract market.
Beginning in October 2017, White engaged in the foregoing acts within the scope of his
employment, office, or agency with MWGF. Therefore, pursuant to Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act
and Regulation 1.2, MWGF is liable for Whiteâs actions. Because White and MWGEF engaged in
this conduct without being registered with the Commission as CPOs, White and MWGF violated
Section 4m(1) of the Act.

D. White Violated Section 4k(2) of the Act
Section 4k(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6k(2) (2012), provides that:

It shall be unlawful for any person to be associated with a
commodity pool operator as a partner, officer, employee,
consultant, or agent (or any person occupying a similar status or
performing similar functions), in any capacity that involves (i) the
solicitation of funds, securities, or property for a participation in a
commodity pool or (ii) the supervision of any person or persons so
engaged, unless such person is registered with the Commission
under this Act as an associated person of such commodity pool
operator.

As described above, from October 2017 to July 2018, White was associated with MWGF and
acted on its behalf in soliciting and collecting funds from at least one participant whose funds
were pooled in an investment vehicle trading commodity futures contracts on a designated
contract market. Because White was not registered with the Commission as an AP of MWGF,
White violated Section 4k(2) of the Act.

VI. ORDER

Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT:

A.

Respondent White shall cease and desist from violating Sections 4b(a)(1), 4k(2), 4m(1),
and 40(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6b(a)(1), 6k(2), 6m(1), 60(1) (2012).

Respondent MWGEF and its successors and assigns shall cease and desist from violating
Sections 4b(a)(1), 4m(1), and 40(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6b(a)(1), 6m(1), 60(1) (2012).

Respondents shall pay, jointly and severally, a civil monetary penalty of two hundred
thousand dollars ($200,000) (âCMP Obligationââ) within ten days of the date of the entry
of this Order. If the CMP Obligation is not paid in full within ten days of the date of
entry of this Order, then post-judgment interest shall accrue on the CMP Obligation
beginning on the date of entry of this Order and shall be determined by using the
Treasury Bill rate prevailing on the date of entry of this Order pursuant to 28 U.S.C.

Â§ 1961 (2012).

Respondents shall pay the CMP Obligation and any post-judgment interest by electronic
funds transfer, U.S. postal money order, certified check, bank cashierâs check, or bank
money order. If payment is to be made other than by electronic funds transfer, then the
payment shall be made payable to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and sent
to the address below:

MMAC/ESC/AMK326

Commodity Futures Trading Commission
Division of Enforcement

6500 S. MacArthur Blvd.

Oklahoma City, OK 73169

(405) 954-6569 office

(405) 954-1620 fax
9-AMC-AR-CFTC@faa.gov

If payment is to be made by electronic funds transfer, Respondents shall contact Marie
Thorne or her successor at the above address to receive payment instructions and shall
fully comply with those instructions. Respondents shall accompany payment of the CMP
Obligation with a cover letter that identifies the paying Respondent and the name and

9
docket number of this proceeding. The paying Respondent shall simultaneously transmit
copies of the cover letter and the form of payment to the Chief Financial Officer,
Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street,
N.W., Washington, DC 20581.

Respondents shall pay, jointly and severally, restitution in the amount of eight hundred
eighty-three thousand nine hundred seventy four dollars and thirty-three cents
($883,974.33), (âRestitution Obligationâ), within ten days of the date of the entry of this
Order. The Restitution Obligation shall be immediately reduced by payments already
made by Respondents to pool participants, totaling six hundred two thousand three
dollars and thirty-six cents ($602,003.36). Respondentsâ remaining Restitution
Obligation is two hundred eighty-one thousand nine hundred seventy dollars and ninety-
seven cents ($281,970.97). If the Restitution Obligation is not paid in full within ten days
of the date of entry of this Order, then post-judgment interest shall accrue on the
Restitution Obligation beginning on the date of entry of this Order and shall be
determined by using the Treasury Bill rate prevailing on the date of entry of this Order
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1961 (2012).

To effect payment by Respondents and the distribution of restitution to Respondentsâ
customers, the Commission appoints the NFA as âMonitor.â The Monitor shall receive
payments of the Restitution Obligation and any post-judgment interest from

Respondents and make distributions as set forth below. Because the Monitor is not being
specially compensated for these services, and these services are outside the normal duties
of the Monitor, it shall not be liable for any action or inaction arising from its
appointment as Monitor other than actions involving fraud.

Respondents shall make their payments of the Restitution Obligation and any post-
judgment interest under this Order in the name of the âM.W. Global Futures LLCâs
Settlement Fundâ and shall send such payments by electronic funds transfer, or U.S.
postal money order, certified check, bank cashierâs check, or bank money order to the
Office of Administration, National Futures Association, 300 South Riverside Plaza, Suite
1800, Chicago, Illinois 60606, under a cover letter that identifies the paying Respondent
and the name and docket number of this proceeding. The paying Respondent shall
simultaneously transmit copies of the cover letter and the form of payment to the Chief
Financial Officer, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Three Lafayette Centre,
1155 21st Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20581.

The Monitor shall oversee Respondentsâ Restitution Obligation and shall have the
discretion to determine the manner of distribution of funds in an equitable fashion to the
Respondentsâ customers or may defer distribution until such time as the Monitor may
deem appropriate. In the event that the amount of payments of the Restitution Obligation
to the Monitor are of a de minimis nature such that the Monitor determines that the
administrative cost of making a restitution distribution is impractical, the Monitor may, in
its discretion, treat such restitution payments as civil monetary penalty payments, which
the Monitor shall forward to the Commission, as discussed below. To the extent any
funds accrue to the U.S. Treasury for satisfaction of Respondentsâ Restitution Obligation,
such funds shall be transferred to the Monitor for disbursement in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this Order.

10
Respondents are permanently prohibited from, directly or indirectly, engaging in trading
on or subject to the rules of any registered entity (as that term is defined in Section 1a(40)
of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1a(40) (2012)), and all registered entities shall refuse them trading
privileges; and

Respondents and their successors and assigns shall comply with the following conditions
and undertakings set forth in the Offer:

1,

Public Statements: Respondents agree that neither they nor any of their
successors and assigns, agents or employees under their authority or control shall
take any action or make any public statement denying, directly or indirectly, any
findings or conclusions in this Order or creating, or tending to create, the
impression that this Order is without a factual basis; provided, however, that
nothing in this provision shall affect Respondentsâ: (i) testimonial obligations; or
(11) right to take legal positions in other proceedings to which the Commission is
not a party. Respondents and their successors and assigns shall comply with this
agreement, and shall undertake all steps necessary to ensure that all of their agents
and/or employees under their authority or control understand and comply with
this agreement.

Respondents agree that they shall never, directly or indirectly:

a. Enter into any transactions involving âcommodity interestsâ (as that
term is defined in Regulation 1.3, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.3 (2019)), for
Respondentsâ own personal accounts or for any accounts in which
Respondents have a direct or indirect interest;

b. Have any commodity interests traded on Respondentsâ behalf;

C. Control or direct the trading for or on behalf of any other person or
entity, whether by power of attorney or otherwise, in any account
involving commodity interests;

d. Solicit, receive, or accept any funds from any person for the
purpose of purchasing or selling any commodity interests;

e. Apply for registration or claim exemption from registration with the
Commission in any capacity, and engage in any activity requiring such
registration or exemption from registration with the Commission
except as provided for in Regulation 4.14(a)(9), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 4.14(a)(Q9)
(2019); and/or

f. Act as a principal (as that term is defined in Regulation 3.1(a), 17
C.F.R. Â§ 3.1(a) (2019)), agent or any other officer or employee of any
person (as that term is defined in Section 1a(38) of the Act), registered,
required to be registered, or exempted from registration with the
Commission except as provided for in Regulation 4.14(a)(9).

1]
3, Cooperation with Monitor: Respondents shall cooperate with the Monitor as
appropriate to provide such information as the Monitor deems necessary and
appropriate to identify Respondentsâ customers, whom the Monitor, in its sole
discretion, may determine to include in any plan for distribution of any restitution
payments. Respondents shall execute any documents necessary to release funds
that they have in any repository, bank, investment or other financial institution,
wherever located, in order to make partial or total payment toward the Restitution
Obligation.

4, Partial Satisfaction: Respondents understand and agree that any acceptance by
the Commission of any partial payment of Respondentsâ CMP Obligation shall
not be deemed a waiver of their obligation to make further payments pursuant to
this Order, or a waiver of the Commissionâs right to seek to compel payment of
any remaining balance.

5. Change of Address/Phone: Until such time as Respondents satisfy in full their
Restitution Obligation and CMP Obligation as set forth in this Order,
Respondents shall provide written notice to the Commission by certified mail of
any change to their telephone number and mailing address within ten calendar
days of the change.

 

The provisions of this Order shall be effective as of this date.

By the Commission.

<h1>New York Federal Court Orders Defendants to Pay More Than $595,000 for Forex Solicitation Fraud and Misappropriation</h1>

<p style=""margin-bottom:13px""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""line-height:115%""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><b><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""line-height:115%""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"">Washington, DC </span></span></span></b><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""line-height:115%""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"">â The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced that the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered an order of consent judgment against <b>Jason Amada</b> and his company <b>Amada Capital Management LLC</b>, both of New York, finding they fraudulently solicited more than $680,000 from 18 clients to open individually managed off-exchange foreign currency (forex) accounts and misappropriated client funds.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:13px""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""line-height:115%""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""line-height:115%""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"">The order requires the defendants to pay $596,700 in restitution to defrauded clients and prohibits them from engaging in conduct that violates certain provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations. The order also permanently bans the defendants from registering with the CFTC, claiming an exemption from registration, and trading in CFTC-regulated markets. The judgment resolves a CFTC enforcement case filed on August 29, 2018. (See CFTC Press Release No.Â <a href=""https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/7778-18""><span style=""color:blue"">7778-18</span></a>).</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

The defendants also regularly provided clients with false account statements showing profitable trading, when the defendants actually had engaged in only limited, unsuccessful forex trading and used the vast majority of client funds to make cash withdrawals or to pay for business or personal expenses, including restaurant meals, rent, and fantasy sports bets. Additionally, the defendants failed to register with the CFTC as required under the Commodity Exchange Act and Commission regulations.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

Jason Amada</i>, Indictment No. 3017-2018 and Superior Court Information 3046-2019 (N.Y. Sup. Ct.)]. On November 21, 2019, Amada was sentenced to three to six years in prison.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers and to ensure that wrongdoers are held accountable.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

1. The Parties to this Consent Order

15. Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an independent federal

Regulations. The Commission is headquartered at 1155 21st Street N.W., Washington, DC

20581.

16. Defendant Amada Capital Management LLC, (a/k/a Amada Capital Markets,
ACM Capital Markets, and Evolution FX Trading) is a New York entity with its last known
place of business at 110-33 72nd Avenue, Suite 1A, Forest Hills, New York 11375. ACM has
never been registered with the Commission in any capacity.

17. Defendant Jason Amada is a resident of New York, New York and is the sole
owner and sole managing member of ACM and operated its websites. Amada has never been
registered with the Commission in any capacity.

2. ACM and Amada Fraudulently Solicited Client Funds for Managed Forex
Accounts and Misappropriated Those Funds for Personal Use.

18. | Between at least October 2013 and continuing to at least December 2018 (the
âRelevant Periodâ), ACM, an unregistered commodity trading advisor, and Amada, an
unregistered associated person of ACM, fraudulently solicited and accepted over $400,000 from
at least seventeen clients for the purpose of trading off-exchange foreign currency contracts
(âforexâ).

19. In addition to accepting money from clients directly, Defendants fraudulently
solicited at least one client (âClient Aââ) to open an individually managed forex trading account
through a Retail Foreign Exchange Dealer (âRFEDâ) that ACM and Amada managed on behalf
of the client.

20. Defendantsâ clients were neither eligible commercial entities (âECEâ), nor
eligible contract participants (âECPâ), as defined in Section 1a(17) and (18) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
Â§ 1a(17), (18) (2018).

21. Defendants represented to clients that they would use the funds to trade

individually managed forex accounts opened in the clientsâ names.
as

wy
ps
forest

22. Defendants represented that they had years of profitable trading experience on
behalf of clients.

23. These representations were false as Defendants have no record of profitable forex
trading. Instead, ACM is nothing more than a sham company built to misappropriate client
funds for personal use.

24. Once ACM or Amada received funds from clients, they often withdrew the funds
as cash. Otherwise, Defendants primarily used clientsâ funds for personal expenses such as
restaurant meals, rent, fantasy sports websites, and unrelated business expenses. Defendants
used only a small portion of client funds for forex trading and, despite claims to the contrary,
Defendants never segregated the funds. Defendantsâ limited forex trading was unprofitable
overall.

25. For example, on January 1, 2015, Amada had a beginning balance of $11.23 in his
bank account at Urban Upbound Credit Union (âUrban Accountâ). On March 12, 2015, Amada
received a wire for $5,000 from Client B for the purpose of Defendants managing a forex
account on Client Bâs behalf. The next day, Amada withdrew $2,000 in cash and issued a
cashierâs check to himself for $3,000. During this time, Amada had no other transactions in his
Urban Account.

26. Defendants regularly provided clients with false account statements showing
profitable trading on the clientsâ behalf. There is no record of Amada or ACM ever engaging in
profitable forex trading. Defendants also used the false account statements to solicit additional
funds from clients.

27. For example, on March 27, 2018, Client C gave Amada a check for $10,000 to

open an individually managed forex account. Defendants then provided Client C with periodic,
un
co
pod

false account statements showing consistent profits in Client Câs trading account. Based on
these statements showing profitable returns, Defendants solicited additional funds from Client C.
Client C wrote ACM a check for $20,000 on July 14, 2018. On November 6, 2018âafter
Amada was released on bail in the Criminal ActionâAmada solicited additional funds from
Client C, again claiming that Defendants had placed profitable trades in Client Câs forex account.
Client C wrote Amada a check for $20,000 on November 6, 2018, for the purpose of providing
additional capital to fund her individually managed trading account. Forex trading account
statements that Client C received from Defendants reflected the additional deposits in her
account. These account statements, however, falsely claimed that Defendants had profitably
traded forex on Client Câs behalf.

28. Defendants also provided periodic payments to certain clients. In connection with
these payments, Defendants claimed the payments represented profits from the trading on the
clientâs behalf. In reality, the payments were Ponzi payments, derived from funds provided by
other clients.

29. In total, between October 2013 and March 14, 2019, Defendants obtained over
$400,000 from clients and returned only a portion of the funds in the form of Ponzi payments.
Through a combination of misappropriation and trading losses, Defendants caused $317,202 in

losses to clients that provided money directly to them.

3. Defendants Fraudulently Solicited a Client for a Managed Forex Account
with a Foreign RFED.
30. Defendants fraudulently solicited at least one client to open a managed forex

account with a foreign Registered RFED by misrepresenting, among other things, Client Aâs risk
of loss associated with forex trading. Specifically, Defendants made false statements to Client A

that they would implement a hedging strategy to protect Client Aâs funds from loss, that
. oN ta ea ~ oe ey

Defendants had significant and profitable experience trading forex for clients, and that Client Aâs
account would be opened through a registered RFED, which could legally enter into retail forex
transactions with U.S. customers under the Act and Regulations.

31. Defendants did not disclose to Client A that Defendants would ultimately receive
commissions for trades placed in Client Aâs account, whether or not the trades were profitable.
Defendants then used some of the commissions generated through trading Client Aâs account to
reimburse Client Aâs account in an attempt to cover up the mounting lossesâall without
informing Client A of the losses or reimbursements.

32. Despite their promises to trade conservatively and guarantees against loss,
Defendants engaged in excessive, speculative, and unauthorized trading, which caused Client A
to lose $279,498.20 in less than two months of trading.

a. Defendants Made Misrepresentations Concerning the Risk of Loss
Associated with Forex Trading and Defendantsâ Profitable Trading
History Qualifications.

33. In May 2015, Amada met Client A through a social networking website. During
their initial interactions, Amada stated that he was a licensed, professional currency trader.
Client A was physically present in New York City. Amada and Chent A met in person on at
least one occasion and also communicated via email, text, and telephone on other occasions.

34. Onor around July 30, 2015, because of Amadaâs representations that he was a
professional currency trader, Client A sought advice from Amada concerning money she needed
to convert from Euros to U.S. Dollars for the purchase of real estate in New York City.

35. Client A told Amada that she had a low risk tolerance for the conversion of funds
because the money would be needed to pay for property Client A was under contract to

purchaseâwith a closing date in or around January 2016. Client A informed Amada that losing
un
co
pod

more than 1% of the money would jeopardize the property transaction and potentially result in
the loss of the down payment.

36. | Amada stated that he had another client âin a similar situationâ and suggested that
Client A open an account with an RFED to implement a hedging strategy and avoid âtransfer
feesâ that would otherwise be charged by a bank to convert the money from Euros to U.S.
Dollars. Amada also sent a link directing Client A to ACMâs website, which provided additional
information concerning ACMâs offering of managed forex accounts for clients, including claims
that ACM had achieved year-to-date client profits of 99%. Through these initial discussions, and
later communications, Amada solicited Client A to open a retail forex account in which
Defendants would exercise discretionary authority.

37. | Amadaâs representations were false.

38. First, Amada was not âlicensed.â Amada has never been registered with the
Commission even though he knew that the broad solicitation of the public, through ACMâs
website, for managed forex accounts, required registration. In February 2014, the Commissionâs
Division of Enforcement sent a letter to Amada notifying him that he was required to be
registered with the Commission as a commodity trading advisor (âCTAâ) because he was
soliciting clients for individually managed forex accounts through his website. Rather than
register as required by the Act and Regulations, Amada shut down his website.

39. Second, Amada did not manage any accountsâwhether owned by him or by
ACM clientsâthat experienced profitable trading results, let alone anywhere near the 99%
claimed on ACMâs website.

40, Third, Amada never intended to execute a hedging strategy on behalf of Client A.

The trading he executed in Client Aâs account was inconsistent with any purported hedging

aia
NaC LO Me AR

strategy; in fact, the trading was so speculative in nature that Defendantsâ trading lost
approximately 92% of Client Aâs funds after only nine days of trading.

41. Also, despite knowing that Client A was a U.S. citizen, Amada directed Client A
to use her foreign-issued passport to open a managed forex account at a foreign, unregistered
RFEDâfalsely representing that it was merely a division of a U.S. entity that was for clients
âthat have Euro based funds.â He also told Client A that the foreign RFED had âtighter spreadsâ
for the traders that would allow him to better implement his âhedgingâ strategy.

42. Amada directed Client A to open her account with the foreign RFED because its
registered, U.S.-based affiliate would not permit Amada to generate and receive commissions as
an introducing broker without being registered with the Commission. Also, the foreign RFED
permitted greater leverage for trading than the registered U.S.-based affiliate, which
consequently permitted riskier trading to occur in that account.

43. Amada also failed to disclose that the foreign RFED at which Client A opened her
account was not registered with the Commission, and was therefore not permitted to serve as the
counterparty for retail forex transactions with U.S. customers.

44, On September 6, 2015, relying on Amadaâs misrepresentations, Client A entered
into a Money Management Agreement (âMMAâ) with Defendants. Among other things, the
MMaA stated that Amada would have discretionary authority to execute forex transactions on
Client Aâs behalf. The agreement also recited Client Aâs maximum loss target of 1% and that
Amada âwill adjust the position size and risk management accordingly to stay within these
guidelines.â The MMA, however, was never provided to the foreign RFED.

45, On September 6, 2015, Client A also signed a Managed Account Authorization,

Limited Power of Attorney (âPOAâ) with the foreign RFED. By its terms, the POA authorized a

money manager, namely, Amadaâs father, to place trades in Client Aâs account. Even though the
POA nominally authorized Amadaâs father to trade Client Aâs account, Amada actually directed
the trading. The POA also indicated that the money manager would receive, as compensation,
20% of the profits form the managed account.

46. Amada was not identified in the POA filed with the RFED. When Client A
questioned Amada about his father being listed on the POA, Amada told her that it was a family
business, that is was just a formality, and that Amada would be the one conducting all the trading
in the account. Client A did not have any interaction with Amadaâs father until after she closed
the trading account in November 2015.

47. Amadaâs name, however, did not appear on official documents filed with the
foreign RFED because Amada was taking steps to hide, on paper, his involvement in Client Aâs
account because the RFED had rejected Amadaâs previous applications to become a money
manager.

48. Nonetheless, Amada directed all account activity through communications with at
least one of the RFEDâs employees.

b. Defendants Did Not Disclose that They Would Receive Commissions
from the Trading in Client Aâs Account, Regardless of Profitability.

49. On August 19, 2015, Amadaâs mother entered into an Introducing Broker
Agreement with the same foreign RFED. By the terms of this agreement, the foreign RFED
established a control account (âControl Accountâ) in the name of Amadaâs mother for the
purpose of earning commissions based on the trading activity of customers she introduced to the
foreign RFED.

50. The foreign RFED treated Client Aâs account as an account introduced by

Amadaâs mother. The foreign RFED paid commissions to the Contro] Account based on trading

in Client Aâs account that was executed by Amada using his fatherâs Money Manager Account.
Client Aâs account was the only account associated with the Control Account.

51. Amada directed and performed all actions related to the formation of the Control
Account and its transfer of funds through communications with at least one of the RFEDâs
employees.

52. Amada did not disclose to Client A the existence of the Control Account or that
the Control Account would receive commissions for trades placed in Client Aâs account, whether
or not the trading was profitable.

c. Defendants Engaged in Speculative Trading and Covered up the
Losses by Hiding Reimbursements Sent from the Control Account.

53. On September 15, 2015, Client A funded the account with a deposit of
â¬249,121.99 ($280,000). Amada began trading forex in Client Aâs account the same day.
Rather than execute a hedging strategy for Client Aâs Euro-based funds, as Amada claimed he
would, he began speculating on the movement of forex currencies by trading both the U.S.
Dollar and the Euro currencies against multiple foreign currencies, including the Japanese Yen,
New Zealand Dollar, Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar, and Swiss Franc.

54. Between September 15, 2015 and September 23, 2015, Client Aâs account
suffered approximately â¬230,000 ($258,000) in lossesâapproximately 92% of the accountâs
value. Over this same period, the Control Account received approximately â¬95,000 ($106,000)
in fees from trading Client Aâs account.

55. | To cover up his enormous trading losses, on September 21, 2015, Amada
requested that the RFED return â¬50,000 ($56,000) to Client A from the Control Account. On

September 23, 2015, the RFED completed the transfer from the Control Account to Client A.

 

* All U.S. Dollar values are approximated based on exchange rates in place at the time of the conduct.

12
Between September 23, 2015 and September 30, 2015, Amada lost an additional â¬62,889
($70,000)âthe remaining funds from Client Aâs initial deposit, plus most of the â¬50,000
($56,000) transferred from the Control Account. In just the first two weeks of tradingâbetween
September 15, 2015 and September 30, 2015âthe Control] Account received â¬136,158.89
($153,000) in commissions from Amadaâs trading of Client Aâs accountâbased on an initial
deposit of about â¬250,000 ($280,000).

56. Over the remaining time the account stayed open, Amada made an additional five
requests for the RFED to refund fees from the Control Account to Client A to hide the significant
losses in the account. Amada directed the RFED to make the following transfers from the
Control Account to Client A:

of ACMâs clientsâ or prospective clientsâ discretionary accounts without being registered with
Commission as an AP of ACM.

79. When Amada failed to register with the Commission as an AP, he was acting

24. Sometime in 2014, Jousef transitioned the âLive Trading Roomâ to a website
called globaltradercom.com, but the educational videos remained accessible on the fiuturesfx.ca
website. Both websites referred to each other. At globaltraderoorm.com, Jousef continued to
represent himself as a CTA who âtrades his live account in front of studentsâ in âhis live trading
room sessions at FuturesFX.ca and GlobalTradeRoom.corm.â

25. Both the firturesix.ca and globaltradercom.com websites were available to and
accessed by Members, including a Member who resides within this District.

from approximately 300 FuturesFX Members in both the United States and other countries.

Defendantsâ Conduct Regarding Live Trading
31. As part of their marketing strategy, Defendants offered Members access to a

âLive Trading Room.â
 

6 1:19-cv-08409-PAE Document2a Filed O4/22/e0 Page 8 of BS

32. Om the futuresfx.ca website, Defendants advertised â3 LIVE trading roomsâ and
posted numerous testimonials that described live trading taking place in the âLive Trading
Room,â including the following:

a. âTWie get to hear and see Hive trades happening all the time. Being able to
see and take live entries with very tight stops can help a trader immensely.
Futures FX has also launched their new GTR (Global Trade Room) and if one
were inclined, you could attend a Live Trade Room around the clock in all major
time zones... .ââ

b. âNeedless to say, after doing research, watching his videos, and
witnessing Simon use the Price Magnet indicator to trade live in his live trade
room, | discovered that Simon was not engaging in any hyperbole.â

c. âSimon is the REAL DEAL. Simon is a certified CTA. Simon trades
LIVE in front of you. You see his LIVE CHART with his actual account, and

you see him placing the actual trades.â

d. âWhat is unique about the room is Simon trades a LIVE account right in
front of the room.â

@. âSimon trades his account live and we all see it.â

33. Jousef also indicated on his futuresfx.ca website that he trades outside the âLive
Trading Roomâ by stating the following: âIt is not an easy task to trade and teach at the same
time therefore my students understand when | miss good trades. [ do however trade beyond
(Live Trading Room] hours to reach my personal profit targets.â

34. At globaltraderoom.com, Jousetâs personal biography states that âhe trades his
live account in front of students and teaches the exact same strategies and tape reading methods
he used during live trading competitions daily during his live trading room sessions at
FuturesFx.ca and GlobalTradeRoom.com.â

35, Globaltraderoom.com also inchides an image of booklets and CDs with the
âGlobal Trade Roomâ label, which advertise, among other things, âReal Live Trading in

2 Different Sessions,â and âLive Trading every day in Real Time with live accounts.â
 

6 1:19-cv-08409-PAE Document28 Filed O4/22/e0 Page 9 of BS

36. Members who registered to access a free trial âLive Trading Roomâ received an
email from Jousef which included the following statement describing a âLiveâ trading room
session at globaltradercom.com: âPlease be advised that the trades being called are in a live
account with real money so your entries may differ.â During the free trial âLiveâ ade room
sessions, Members also heard Jousef indicate that he was executing actual trades in a live
account.

37, Jousef, however, never traded live in the âLive Trading Reomâ at either
futuresfx.ca or globaltraderoom.com during the Relevant Period. All of his trades were either
hypothetical or simulated. He did not disclose to Members that all of bis trades in the âLive
Trading Roomâ were either hypothetical or simulated.

38.  Jousef admitted that he never traded in a live account outside the âLive Trading
Roomâ and never traded live during the Relevant Period.

Defendantsâ Conduct Regarding Performance, Profitability, and Risk of Loss

39. Defendants made false statements to Members regarding the performance,
profitability, and risk of loss when using their Trading System, as set forth below.

40. In a description of their trading methodology at the futuresfx.ca website,
Defendants described one method as being âabout 80% winner.â On the globaltraderoom.com
website, Defendants described their trading system as â[a] Guaranteed Winning Formula.â

41. Defendants also advertised âSwing Trade Recommendationsâ where they cited
specific instances of historical trades where Jousef earned profits described in terms of both
specific dollar amounts and âticksâ which refer to a specific price increment.

42.  âGlobaltraderoom.com included spreadsheets that purported to describe âGTRâs

Performance Track Recordâ in 2014 and parts of 2015. Those spreadsheets showed profits in
2ase P:o-cv-Ol840G-PAE Document 28 F

 

OU22/20 Page LO of 29

dollar figures, including the representation that total profits in 2014 were $308,160, in addition to
a statement that read: âThese results are with a live account with real money. Your results may
vary.â
43, in his âLive Trading Room,â Jousef also described trading where the majority of
his trades were profitable.
44, At the globaltraderoom.com website, there is a section called âFree Money.â
a. lt begins with the following: âIs there really such a thing as free money?

Yes. Does free money really exist? Yes. So what's the catch? No catch.
What's it cost? Absolutely nothing.â

4

b This section. goes on to compare the â[t}housands of daytrading rooms
with outrageous, unproven, and unverified hypesâ to the âhonestâ and
âtrustworthyâ Global Trade Room, which â[h]as been trading live in front of
students every day since 2005. A live account. By a Hoensed CTA... . Simon
Jousef, owner and head trader at Global TradeRoom.com has been trading his live
account in front of students every day since 2005,â
c. This âFree Moneyâ section goes on to claim that, had a prospective
student taken every trade called out during the free live trading room session at
globaltraderoom.com in 2014, that investor would have earned 2 640% return on
investment.

45. In at least one email advertisement to a prospective Member, Jousef represented
that the âLive Room avg. over 120 ticks a dayâ and it includes the following quote: â[H]avenât
had a losing week in the last 12 months!â

45, However, every reference to performance, profitability, and risk of loss were not
true because Jousef admitted that he never traded live in an actual trading account during the

Relevant Period.

Jousefâs Statements to NEA and Defendantsâ
Representations Regarding Jousefâs Background

47, The National Futures Association (âNFAâ), which is designated by the CFTC as a

registered futures association pursuant to Section 17 of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 21 (2018), is a self-

10

regulatory organization for the U.S. derivatives industry. The CFTC delegated to the NFA
responsibilities regarding CTA registration. To be registered with the Commission as a CTA, an
applicant must not only satisfy the NFAâs registration requirements, but aiso submit annual
updates with the NFA.

48. On February 8, 2007, Jousef incorporated Canada, Inc. which did business as
FuturesFX. On June 6, 2007, Jousef registered Canada, Inc. with the Commission asa CTA.
However, pursuant to Jousefâs voluntary application for dissolution, Canada, Inc. was dissolved
on December 7, 2013, and thus was no longer registered with the Commission as a CTA as of
that date.

43, After Canada, Inc.âs dissolution, Jousef received notices from the NFA on behalf
of the Commission to provide updates on Canada, Inc.âs CTA registration. These notices clearly
indicate that Canada, Inc. is the registrant.

50. On August 14, 2014, after Canada, Inc. was dissolved, Jousef filed an annual
CTA registration update for Canada, Inc. with the NFA indicating that Canada, Inc. remained a
Canadian corporation and that Jousef remained the President of Canada, Inc.

51. On June 26, 2015, Jousef filed another annual CTA registration update for
Canada, Inc. with the NFA indicating that Canada, Inc. remained a Canadian corporation and
that Jousef remained the President of Canada, Ine.

52. Even after Canada, Inc. was no longer a viable business entity and, therefore, no
longer a CTA, and notwithstanding that Jousef had never been registered with the Commission
asa CTA or in any other capacity, Jousef continued to represent himself as a CTA, including on

the futuresfx.ca and globaltraderoom.com websites, during the Relevant Period.

experience, a âMaster Trader,â the âHead Trader,â and as someone who was âvoted as one of the
top five traders in the world,â despite the fact that he admitted that he never traded live during
the âLive Trading Room.â

Defendants Failed to Make the Required Disclesures

54. During the Relevant Period, Defendants placed testimonials on the futuresfx.ca
and globaltraderoorn.com websites, as well as on email advertisements, without prominently
disclosing that such testimonials may not be representative of the experience of other Members,
or that such testirnonials were not guarantees of future performance.

55. During the Relevant Period, Defendants referred to the performance and
profitability of simulated or hypothetical trades, but they did not prominently disclose that such
results were the result of simulated or hypothetical trades.

56. On globaltradercom.comâs âPerformance Track Recordâ section, Defendants
described their performance as the result of trades âwith a live account with real money.â
Although they included a general disclosure about hypothetical or simulated performance, they
did not state that their performance results were hypothetical or simulated.

<h1>CFTC Orders Trader and His Firm to Pay $150,000 for Wash Sales</h1>

The order requires Khorrami and CIM to pay a civil monetary penalty of $150,000. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:13px""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""line-height:115%""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"">According to the order, Khorrami, on behalf of CIM, engaged in multiple wash sales and non-competitive transactions for accounts held by a client of CIM. These transactions involved foreign currency, crude oil, and gold futures contracts. Specifically, on February 8, 2018, Khorrami placed simultaneous buy and sell orders in six different CME futures contracts. Initially, the orders were at different bid and offer prices, but after being unable to fill the orders, Khorrami repeatedly modified the orders until the bid and offer prices matched. This resulted in a series of pre-arranged cross trades in contracts for crude oil, British Pound, Euro FX, Swiss Franc, and Japanese Yen. In total, respondents made six non-competitive prearranged trades. </span></span></span></span></p>

Today, CME issued a Notice of Disciplinary Action in which Khorrami agreed to pay a fine of $30,000 and serve a 10-day suspension arising out of the wash sales and non-competitive transactions that are the subject of the order. </span></span></span></span></p>

ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTION 6(c) AND (d) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, MAKING
FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL sanctions

I. INTRODUCTION

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionââ) has reason to believe that
in February 2018 (âRelevant Periodâ), Mehran Khorrami (âKhorramiâ) and Cayley Investment
Management, LLC (âCIMâ) (collectively, âRespondentsââ) violated Section 4c(a)(I) and (2) of
the Commodity Exchange Act (âActâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6c(a)(1), (2) (2018), and Commission
Regulation (âRegulationâ) 1.38(a), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.38(a) (2019). Therefore, the Commission
deems it appropriate and in the public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and
hereby are, instituted to determine whether Respondents engaged in the violations set forth
herein and to determine whether any order should be issued imposing remedial sanctions.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Respondents have
submitted an Offer of Settlement (âOfferâ), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Without admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, Respondents consent to
the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Section 6(c) and (d) of the Commodity
Exchange Act, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial sanctions (âOrderââ), and acknowledge
service of this Order.'

 

' Respondents consent to the use of the findings of fact and conclusions of law in this Order in this proceeding and
in any other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party or claimant, and agree
that they shall be taken as true and correct and be given preclusive effect therein, without further proof.

Respondents do not consent, however, to the use of this Order, or the findings or conclusions herein, as the sole
basis for any other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party or claimant, other
than: a proceeding in bankruptcy or receivership; or a proceeding to enforce the terms of this Order. Respondents
do not consent to the use of the Offer or this Order, or the findings or conclusions in this Order, by any other party in
any other proceeding.
II. FINDINGS
The Commission finds the following:
A. SUMMARY

During the Relevant Period, Khorrami, on behalf of CIM, engaged in wash sales in
violations of Section 4c(a)(1) and (2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6c(a)(1), (2) (2018). Khorrami entered
bids and offers of similar quantities in the same futures product for trading accounts that had the
same beneficial owner and which were intended to and did in fact offset each other upon
execution. By intentionally entering these offsetting orders in this manner and achieving the
goal of having these bids and offers offset each other upon execution, Khorrami negated the risk
or price competition incidental to an open and competitive marketplace and thus engaged in
noncompetitive transactions in violations of Regulation 1.38(a), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.38(a) (2019).

B. RESPONDENTS

Respondent CIM is a Delaware limited liability company with its principal place of
business in Great Neck, New York. CIM is registered with the Commission as a Commodity
Pool Operator and a Commodity Trading Advisor.

Respondent Khorrami is a principal of CIM and is registered with the Commission as an
Associated Person of CIM. Khorrami is the founder and sole owner of CIM.

C. FACTS

During the Relevant Period, Khorrami, on behalf of CIM, engaged in multiple wash and
non-competitive transactions for accounts held by a beneficial owner that was a client of CIM.
These transactions involved futures products such as British Pound, Euro FX, Swiss Franc, and
Japanese Yen futures traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (âCMEâ), crude oil futures
traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (ââNYMEXââ), and gold futures traded on the
Commodity Exchange Inc. (ââCOMEXââ). CME, NYMEX, and COME X are all designated
contract markets owned and operated by CME Group, Inc. (âCME Groupâ).

Specifically, on February 8, 2018, Khorrami placed simultaneous buy and sell orders in
six different futures contracts. Initially, CIM placed orders at different bid and offer prices, but
after being unable to fill the orders, Khorrami repeatedly modified the orders until the bid and
offer prices matched. This resulted in a series of pre-arranged cross trades in the Crude Oil,
British Pound, Euro FX, Swiss Franc, and Japanese Yen contracts. In total, Respondents made
six noncompetitive prearranged trades. Respondents crossed 73 lots of British Pound, 193 lots of
Euro FX, 104 lots of Japanese Yen, 92 lots of Swiss Franc, 70 lots of Gold, and 6 lots of Crude
Oil.
Ht. LEGAL DISCUSSION

A. Respondents Entered into Wash Sales in violations of Section 4c(a)(1) and (2) of the
Act

Section 4c(a)(1) and (2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6c(a)(1), (2) (2018), in part, makes it
âunlawful for any person to offer to enter into, enter into, or confirm the execution of a
transactionâ that âis of the character of, or is commonly known to the trade as, a âwash sale.ââ A
wash sale is a form of fictitious sale. In re Gimbel, CFTC No. 84-40, 1988 WL 232267, at *1
(Apr. 14, 1988), aff'd as to liability sub nom. Gimbel vy. CFTC, 872 F.2d 196 (7th Cir. 1989).
âT]he Commission also remains of the view that transactions initiated with an intent to avoid
bona fide trading transactions that result in a âwashâ of the constituent positions are wash sales

under Section 4c(a)(A) without regard to the motivation for the particular transaction.â Jd. at *4
n.6.

To establish that a wash sale has occurred, it must initially be demonstrated that the
transaction at issue achieved a wash result. The Commission may demonstrate that the trades
resulted in a wash by showing: â(1) the purchase and sale (2) of the same delivery month of the
same futures contract (3) at the same (or a similar) price.â Wilson v. CFTC, 322 F.3d 555, 559
(8th Cir. 2003) (citing In re Gilchrist, CFTC No. 83-58, 1991 WL 83518, at *9 (Jan. 25, 1991)).

In addition to the factors enumerated in Gilchrist, intent must be proven to establish a
violations of Section 4c of the Act. See, e.g., Reddy v. CFTC, 191 F.3d 109, 119 (2d Cir. 1999).
The intent to negate risk or price competition and avoid a bona fide market position can be
inferred from prearrangement, or âfrom the intentional structuring of a transaction in a manner to
achieve the same result as prearrangement.â Jn re Three Eight Corp., CFTC No. 88-33, 1993
WL 212489, at *7n.15 Jun. 16, 1993) (citing In re Collins, CFTC No. 77-15, 1986 WL 66165,
at *5 (Apr. 4, 1986), revâd on other grounds sub nom. Stoller v. CFTC, 834 F.2d 262 (2d Cir.
1987)). The placement of offsetting orders to buy and sell, while simultaneously taking steps to
âenhance the likelihood that the buy and sell orders would be filled at the same or a similar
priceâ is persuasive evidence that the trader intends to negate risk and price competition.
Collins, CFTC No. 77-15, 1986 WL 66165, at *5 (Apr. 4, 1986); see also In re Piasio, CFTC
No. 97-9, 2000 WL 1466069 (Sept. 29, 2000) (finding customer who placed paired buy and sell
orders, with specific pricing and loss limitation instructions, âstructured orders to negate riskâ
and thus had intent to violate Section 4c), aff'd sub nom. Piasio v. CFTC, 54 Fed. Appâx 702 (2d
Cir. 2002).

Khorrami entered offsetting orders for the purchase and sale of the same delivery month
of the same futures contract that achieved wash results. Additionally, Khorrami knowingly
entered into the purchase and sale of these futures contracts for the purpose of negating market
risk. In doing so, Khorrami violated Section 4c(a)(1) and (2) of the Act by entering into
transactions of the character of, and commonly known as, wash sales.

Khorrami engaged in the foregoing acts within the scope of his employment, office, or
agency with CIM. Therefore, pursuant to Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(a)()(B)
(2018), and Regulation 1.2, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.2 (2019), CIM is liable for Khorramiâs violations of
Section 4c(a)(1) and (2) of the Act.
B. Respondent Executed Noncompetitive Trades in violations of Commission
Regulation 1.38(a)

Regulation 1.38(a), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.38(a) (2019), requires that all purchases and sales of
commodity futures be executed âopenly and competitively.â The purpose of this requirement is
to ensure that all trades are executed at competitive prices and that all trades are directed into a
centralized marketplace to participate in the competitive determination of the price of futures
contracts. Noncompetitive trades are also a type of fictitious sale because they negate the risk
incidental to an open and competitive market. In re Fisher, CFTC No. 93-2, 2004 WL 584216,
at *3 n.11 (Mar. 24, 2004); see also In re Copersucar Trading A.V.V., CFTC No. 17-22, 2017
WL 3588915, at *3-4 (Aug. 15, 2017) (consent order) (structuring and transferring positions
between proprietary accounts constituted violations of Regulation 1.38 (a)).

Because Khorrami structured and entered the offsetting orders with the intent that they
would offset Proposed Respondentsâ original bids or offers and negate risk, the executions of
these orders were not open and competitive. Thus, because he engaged in noncompetitive trades,
Khorrami violated Regulation 1.38(a).

Khorrami engaged in the foregoing acts within the scope of his employment, office, or
agency with CIM. Therefore, pursuant to Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(a)()(B)
(2018), and Regulation 1.2, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.2 (2019), CIM is liable for Khorramiâs violations of
Regulation 1.38(a).

<p class=""CxSpMiddle""><span style=""line-height:normal""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"">The order requires Alper to pay restitution totaling $352,901, plus a civil monetary penalty of the same amount. The order also imposes permanent trading and registration bans on Alper and prohibits him from violating provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act and Commission regulations, as charged. The order stems from a CFTC complaint filed on October 24, 2019, which charged Alper with fraud, misappropriation, and engaging in prohibited activities as a commodity trading advisor. [See CFTC Press Release No. </span></span><a href=""https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8061-19"" style=""color:blue; text-decoration:underline""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"">8061-19</span></span></a><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"">]</span></span></span></p>

<p class=""CxSpMiddle""><span style=""line-height:normal""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"">The order finds that beginning in late 2015 and lasting until October of 2019, Alper fraudulently solicited members of the public to trade futures and foreign currency (forex) contracts through managed accounts.Â  To solicit customer funds, Alper made material misrepresentations and omissions, including that he was an experienced and successful trader who controlled a large-dollar trading account at a UK-based trading firm. Additionally, Alper never opened trading accounts for his customers as promised, but instead misappropriated virtually all of the funds provided to him to pay his own personal expenses, including, among other things, international travel, restaurant bills, and car rentals. To conceal his misappropriation, Alper sent false statements to his customers reporting profits in the fictitious accounts and lied to customers about conditions that purportedly prevented him from honoring their withdrawal requests.</span></span></span></p>

<p class=""CxSpMiddle""><span style=""line-height:normal""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"">The CFTC cautions that orders requiring repayment of funds to victims may not result in the recovery of any money lost because the wrongdoers may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers and to ensure that wrongdoers are held accountable.</span></span></span></p>

<p class=""CxSpMiddle""><span style=""line-height:normal""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"">The CFTC thanks and acknowledges the assistance of the UK Financial Conduct Authority.</span></span></span></p>

THE COURT HEREBY FINDS:
YOOES220SS Hoccunaeat2Ss1 Ail#ecOGSI27220 Aeaiecccobi22

 

A. FINDINGS OF FACT

The Parties to This Consent Order
17. Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an independent federal
regulatory agency that is charged by Congress with administering and enforcing the Act and the
Regulations.
18. Defendant Eyal Alper is an individual who resides in Tarrytown, New York.

Alper has never been registered with the CFTC.

Defendant Fraudulently Solicited Customers

19. From at least late 2015 through October 2019 (the âRelevant Periodâ), Alper
solicited at least thirteen (13) customers to trade futures contracts and/or retail forex through
accounts managed by him. Alperâs solicitations occurred primarily in telephone conversations
with customers; however, in some instances, Alper met face-to-face with customers.

20. During the course of his solicitations, Alper stated or implied to customers that he
was an experienced and successful trader. He told at least one customer that he had been trading
for five to seven years and that after losing money early in his career, he had not had a down
month in many years and that he had experienced double digit growth. He stated to another
customer that he had taken an account of approximately $40,000 and grown that into $400,000.

21. In fact, Alper had not had an active or even a funded futures or retail forex trading
account at any domestic futures commission merchant (âFCMâ) or retail foreign exchange dealer
(âRFEDâ) since at least as far back as January 2014.

22. â Alper also stated or implied to customers that he controlled a large-dollar trading

account at FxPro, a UK-based trading firm; he told some customers that the account was over $1

1.
Geasd/71Poerv0GSS22C5S Doocunaat2231 AlbecOSS027220 Feagesoob222

million. Alper told customers that because of the size of his account, he was able to open sub-
accounts on their behalf under his master account.

23. In fact, Alper never had an account or any subaccounts at FxPro, and it has been
the policy at FxPro since 2010 not to accept accounts from U.S. customers.

24. â Alper told customers that if they invested their money with him, he would put that
money into a sub-account under his master account at FxPro and trade futures contracts and/or
retail forex on a discretionary basis on their behalf. Alper said that he would charge a
commission of approximately thirty percent (30%) of any profits achieved. In addition, Alper
offered at least some customers a cash bonus on top of their profits if they kept their money with
Alper for at least six months.

25. On the basis of Alperâs representations, at least thirteen customers sent money to
Alper to trade on their behalf during the Relevant Period. Alper instructed customers to send
their funds not to FxPro, but directly to him, via check, wire, bank transfer, or direct deposit.
Customersâ funds were deposited to bank accounts controlled by Alper.

26. In soliciting customers, Alper made no attempt to determine if they were eligible
contract participants (âECPsâ) under Section 1a(18)(A)(xi) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1a(18)(A)(xi)

(2018). In fact, most, if not all, of Alperâs customers were not ECPs.

Defendant Misappropriated Customer Funds

27. Alper never transferred any of the funds received from his customers into
subaccounts at FxPro or into accounts at any domestic FCM or RFED for trading futures or retail
forex. Contrary to the representations made to his customers, Alper misappropriated his
customersâ funds and used them to pay for his personal expenses. For example, during the

Relevant Period, Alper made numerous cash withdrawals from a bank account into which
Gaeed/71PecrvOSS32205S Mipocuneat2esl AlbecOGS027220 Heage7/ob222

customer funds had been deposited, as well as numerous transfers from that account to his
personal bank account. In addition, Alper used the funds in that bank account to pay for, among
other things, international travel, restaurants, and car rentals.

28. â Specifically, Alper misappropriated $352,901.03 of customersâ funds and used
these funds to pay personal expenses, including, among other things, international travel,

restaurants, and car rentals.

Defendant Issued False Statements to Customers

29. To conceal his misappropriation, Alper sent false statements to his customers
which purported to show that their accounts were making profits. These statements consisted of
screenshots sent to customers via text message which purported to show the customerâs balance,
equity, margin level, and gains/losses on various trades of futures contracts and/or retail forex.
The statements did not contain the name of FxPro on them; nor did they contain an account
number. Indeed, Alper never provided his customers with their account numbers. The
statements were not dated; nor did they provide the date on which the purported trades listed
âwere made.

30. Despite the fact that no customer funds were ever transferred to FxPro, the
statements sent to customers showed that their accounts were making profits. On the basis of
these false statements, Alper calculated and claimed his commission from his customers. Rather
than take his commission from the purported profits made by his customersâ accounts, Alper
convinced some of his customers to send additional funds to his bank account to pay his
commission. During the Relevant Period, Alper received $352,901.03 from customers in

principal and commission payments.
Geasd/71Poerv0OSS22C5S Doocunaet22s1 AlbecOSs027220 Feaecseob222

When Customers Sought to Withdraw Funds from Their Accounts,

Defendant Made Further Misrepresentations to Cover Up His
Misappropriation

31. At various times during the Relevant Period, at least nine customers sought to
withdraw funds from their accounts. In some instances, Alper failed to respond at all to a
customerâs request. In other instances, Alper responded with various false excuses as to why he
could not immediately comply with the request. Among the excuses that Alper made to
customers as to why he could not comply with their withdrawal requests were that: (1) the
Securities and Exchange Commission was auditing his books; (2) his accounts were frozen; and
(3) the money was stuck overseas. Alper continued either to ignore customersâ withdrawal
requests or to make excuses to customers until they gave up on getting their money back. Alper
has never returned any money to any of these nine customers in response to their requests for
withdrawals.

Â§ 5.2(b)(1) and (3).

38. By the conduct described above, Alper willfully or recklessly issued or caused to

10
Gaeed/71 Pecrv0SS8a20SS MpocuneateEsl AlbecOGS027220 Heagelllobh22

misrepresented the profitability and value of customersâ accounts, in violations of 7 U.S.C.

Â§ 6b(a)(2)(B) and 17 C.F.R. Â§ 5.2(b)(2).

violations of Section 40(1)(A) and (B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. & 60(1)(A) and (B)
(2018)

39. 7 U.S.C. Â§ 60(1)(A) and (B), in relevant part, makes it unlawful for a commodity
trading advisor (âCTAâ), by use of the mails or any other means or instrumentality of interstate
commerce, directly or indirectly, to: (A) employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud any
customer; or (B) engage in any transaction, practice, or course of business that operates as a

be registered, or exempted from registration.

42. Section 1a(12) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1a(12) (2018), defines a CTA as any person
who for compensation or profit, engages in the business of advising others as to the value or
advisability of trading in, among other things, futures contracts or retail forex transactions.
Similarly, Regulation 5.1(e)(1), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 5.1(e)(1) (2019), defines a CTA as âany person who
exercises discretionary trading authority or obtains written authorization to exercise discretionary
trading authority over any account for or on behalf of any person that is not an [ECP] in
connection with retail forex transactions.â

43. In the case of an individual, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1a(18)(A)(xi) defines an ECP to mean a
person âacting for its own account . . . who has amounts invested on a discretionary basis, the

aggregate of which is in excess of â (I) $10,000,000; or (II) $5,000,000 and who enters into the

agreement, contract, or transaction in order to manage the risk associated with an asset owned or
liability incurred, or reasonably likely to be owned or incurred, by the individual.â

44. â By the conduct described above, Alper acted as a CTA as defined in part by
7U.S.C. Â§ 1a(12) (2018), in that, for compensation or profit, he engaged in the business of
advising others as to the value or advisability of trading in, among other things, futures contracts
or retail forex transactions. Similarly, by the conduct described above, Alper acted as a CTA as
defined by Regulation 5.1(Â¢)(1), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 5.1(e)(1) (2019), in that he exercised discretionary
trading authority or obtained written authorization to exercise discretionary trading authority
over accounts for or on behalf of persons who were not ECPs in connection with retail forex
transactions.

45, As set forth above, Alper, while acting as CTA, through use of the mails or other
means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce, directly or indirectly employed a device,
scheme, or artifice to defraud customers and engaged in transactions, practices, or courses of
business that operated as a fraud or deceit upon customers, by among other things:

(a) misappropriating customersâ funds;
(b) making material misrepresentations and omitting material facts to
prospective and actual customers; and
(c) making, causing to be made, and distributing reports or statements to

violations of Regulation 4.36(a), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 4.30(a) (2019)

46. 17 C.E.R. Â§ 4.30(a) prohibits a CTA, whether registered, required to be registered,
or exempted from registration, from soliciting, accepting, or receiving from an existing or
prospective customer funds in the CTAâs name to purchase, margin, or guarantee any
commodity interest of the customer.

47. By the conduct described above, Alper violated 17 C.F.R. Â§ 4.30(a), in that he
solicited, accepted, and received funds from customers in his own name for the purpose of
purchasing, margining, guaranteeing, or securing futures contracts and/or retail forex contracts

fog them.

Need for Injunction

Vv. RESTITUTION AND CIVIL MONETARY PENALTY
A. Restitution

51. Alper shall pay restitution in the amount of three hundred fifty-two thousand, nine
hundred one dollars and three cents ($352,901.03) (âRestitution Obligationâ), representing the
customer losses that he caused through misappropriation of customer funds in connection with
such violations, plus post-judgment interest. Post-judgment interest shall accrue on the
Restitution Obligation beginning on the date of entry of this Consent Order and shall be
determined by using the Treasury Bill rate prevailing on the date of entry of this Consent Order
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1961 (2018).

32. To effect payment of the Restitution Obligation and the distribution of any
restitution payments to customers by Alper, the Court appoints the National Futures Association
(âNFAâ) as Monitor (âMonitorâ). The Monitor shall receive restitution payments from Alper
and make distributions as set forth below. Because the Monitor is acting as an officer of this
Court in performing these services, the NFA shall not be liable for any action or inaction arising
from NFAâs appointment as Monitor, other than actions involving fraud.

53. Alper shall make Restitution Obligation payments under this Consent Order to the

Monitor in the name âEyal Alper Restitution Fundâ and shall send such Restitution Obligation

15
Gaeed/71 Pecrv0SS3a205S Mpocuneateeel AlbecOGSI27220 Heagel Beobh22

payments by electronic funds transfer, or by U.S. postal money order, certified check, bank
cashierâs check, or bank money order, to the Office of Administration, National Futures
Association, 300 South Riverside Plaza, Suite 1800, Chicago, Illinois 60606, under cover letter
that identifies the paying Defendant and the name and docket number of this proceeding. Alper
shall simultaneously transmit copies of the cover letter and the form of payment to the Chief
Financial Officer, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st
Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20581.

54. The Monitor shall oversee the Restitution Obligation and shall have the discretion
to determine the manner of distribution of such funds in an equitable fashion to participants
identified by the Commission or may defer distribution until such time as the Monitor deems
appropriate. In the event that the amount of Restitution Obligation payments to the Monitor are
of a de minimis nature such that the Monitor determines that the administrative cost of making a
distribution to eligible customers is impractical, the Monitor may, in its discretion, treat such
restitution payments as civil monetary penalty payments, which the Monitor shall forward to the
Commission following the instructions for civil monetary penalty payments set forth in Part V.
B. below.

55. Alper shall cooperate with the Monitor as appropriate to provide such information
as the Monitor deems necessary and appropriate to identify the customers to whom the Monitor,
in its sole discretion, may determine to include in any plan for distribution of any Restitution
Obligation payments. Alper shall execute any documents necessary to release funds that he has
in any repository, bank, investment or other financial institution, wherever located, in order to

make partial or total payment toward the Restitution Obligation.
Gaeed/71 Pecrv0SS3a205S MpocuneateEel AlbecOGS027220 Heagel Y/obh22

56. | The Monitor shall provide the Commission at the beginning of each calendar year
with a report detailing the disbursement of funds to Alperâs customers during the previous year.
The Monitor shall transmit this report under a cover letter that identifies the name and docket
number of this proceeding to the Chief Financial Officer, Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20581.

The order requires Gain UK to pay a $250,000 civil monetary penalty, to disgorge $241,671, and to cease and desist from any further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) or CFTC regulations, as charged.Â Â Â Â Â Â  </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

Gain UK accepted customers who used U.S. mailing addresses in account applications and provided documents such as lease agreements, utility bills, and health-insurance enrollment letters suggesting that they were located in the United States. Furthermore, one customer informed a Gain UK employee that she was a student at a U.S. university when questioned about her account application and U.S. mailing address. Nevertheless, Gain UK failed to register as an RFED as required.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

Specifically, Gain UK failed to detect warning signs of the underlying fraudulent conduct by an unregistered CTA who solicited the retail forex customer to open an account with Gain UK. For example, a Gain UK employee had extensive communications with the unregistered CTA and was aware that the CTA had been rejected from managing accounts with Gain UK and its affiliates because the CTA may have been soliciting managed accounts through social media and a website without registering with the CFTC. Despite the unregistered CTA not being named on any of the account documents, the CTA had extensive communications with Gain UKâs employee about creating the account, directed the trading in it, and refunded commissions to the customer to reimburse significant trading losses. Due to the unregistered CTAâs fraudulent conduct, the customer suffered approximately $280,000 in losses while Gain UK earned $241,671.Â Â  </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTION 6(c) AND (d) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, MAKING
FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL sanctions

I. INTRODUCTION

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ) has reason to believe that
from on or about February 6, 2014 to March 8, 2019 (âRelevant Periodââ), Gain Capital UK
Limited (âGain UKâ or âRespondentâ), acting through Gain Capital Forex.com UK Limited until
its business operations were integrated into Gain UK on October 6, 2017, violated Section
2(c)(2)(C)G1)(1)(aa) of the Commodity Exchange Act (âActâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(c)(2)(C)Gi1)(1)(aa)
(2018), and Commission Regulations (âRegulationsâ) 5.3(a)(6)() and 166.3, 17 C.F.R.

Â§Â§ 5.3(a)(6)(1), 166.3 (2019) promulgated thereunder. Therefore, the Commission deems it
appropriate and in the public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are,
instituted to determine whether Respondent engaged in the violations set forth herein and to
determine whether any order should be issued imposing remedial sanctions.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Respondent has
submitted an Offer of Settlement (âOfferâ), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Without admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, Respondent consents to
the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Section 6(c) and (d) of the Commodity
Exchange Act, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial sanctions (âOrderâ) and acknowledges
service of this Order.â

 

' Respondent consents to the use of the findings of fact and conclusions of law in this Order in this proceeding and
in any other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party or claimant, and agrees
that they shall be taken as true and correct and be given preclusive effect therein, without further proof. Respondent
does not consent, however, to the use of this Order, or the findings or conclusions herein, as the sole basis for any
other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party or claimant, other than: a
proceeding in bankruptcy or receivership; or a proceeding to enforce the terms of this Order. Respondent does not
consent to the use of the Offer or this Order, or the findings or conclusions in this Order, by any other party in any
other proceeding.
II. FINDINGS
The Commission finds the following:
A. SUMMARY

From at least February 6, 2014 to March 8, 2019 (âRelevant Periodâ), Gain UK, without
being registered with the Commission as a retail foreign exchange dealer (âRFEDâ), accepted a
limited number of customers who were located in the United States and not Eligible Contract
Participants (âECPsââ) to open retail forex accounts. Gain UK also failed to diligently supervise
the handling of an account for one of the non-ECP customers (âCustomer Aââ) that was managed
by an unregistered commodity trading advisor (âTrading Advisorâ). A Gain UK employee
learned that Trading Advisor was required to be registered, and Gain UK failed to detect several
warning signs that Trading Advisor was defrauding Customer A.

B. RESPONDENT

Gain Capital UK Limited is an unregistered RFED located in London, England. During
the Relevant Period, Gain Capital Forex.com UK Limited was an unregistered RFED located in
London, England until its business operations were integrated into Gain UK on October 6, 2017.

C. FACTS

1. Gain UK Accepted Orders for Forex Transactions from Non-ECP
Customers Located in the United States.

During the Relevant Period, Gain UK acted as a counterparty to non-ECP customers who
were located in the United States in connection with leveraged retail forex transactions while not
being registered as an RFED. Gain UK had a policy to prevent non-ECP customers located in
the United States from opening retail forex accounts. Despite that policy, however, a limited
number of customers (who provided Gain UK with information that suggested the customers
were located in the United States) succeeded in opening accounts with Gain UK. For example,
some retail forex customersâafter identifying U.S. mailing addresses on account applicationsâ
provided Gain UK with documents such as lease agreements, utility bills, and health-insurance
enrollment letters further suggesting that the customers were located in the United States.
Similarly, Customer A (who provided a copy of her foreign government issued identification that
matched the primary non-U.S. address on her account application) listed a U.S. mailing address
and telephone number on her account application, and when asked by a Gain UK employee,
informed Gain UK that she was a student at a university in the United States. Gain UK,
nonetheless, permitted her to open a retail forex account.

2. Gain UK Failed To Diligently Supervise the Handling of a Retail Forex
Account of a Non-ECP Customer Located in the United States.

Gain UK failed to diligently supervise the handling of Customer Aâs retail forex account.
First, as relevant here, Trading Advisorâand acting through his companyâsolicited
Customer A, to open an individually managed forex trading account with Gain UK. During the
account opening process, Trading Advisor communicated with a Gain UK employee about
Customer Aâs account. Even though Customer A was located in the United States, Trading
Advisor directed her to open a managed forex account with Gain UKâbased in part on
communications Trading Advisor had with the Gain UK employee, who advised Trading
Advisor how Customer A could open a retail forex account with Gain UK. The employee was
aware that Trading Advisor had been rejected from managing accounts with Gain UK, as well as
its affiliates, because Trading Advisor may have been soliciting managed accounts through
social media and a website while not being registered with the Commission. The employee,
however, assisted Trading Advisor in establishing Trading Advisorâs father as the nominal
account manager and Trading Advisorâs mother as the nominal introducing broker, even though
Customer A listed Trading Advisorâs entity as the account manager on her application. And,
despite Trading Advisor not being named on any of the account documents, Trading Advisor had
extensive communications with Gain UKâs employee about Customer Aâs account, including
about creating it, directing the trading in it, and refunding commissions to it to reimburse
significant trading losses. Gain UK failed to promptly detect these discrepancies.

Second, Gain UK permitted Trading Advisorâs mother to earn commissions based on the
trading in Customer Aâs accountâpurportedly being managed by Trading Advisorâs fatherâ
without regard to the trading profits earned for Customer A. When Customer Aâs account
incurred over $250,000 in losses within the first few weeks of opening, Trading Advisor
requested that some of the commissions earned be refunded to Customer Aâs account to
compensate the customer for some of the trading losses. Even though the rermbursement of
commissions was escalated to Gain UKâs compliance department, Gain UK did not perform an
adequate investigation into the account activity and failed to detect the extensive
communications between Trading Advisor and Gain UKâs employee. Due to Trading Advisorâs
fraudulent conduct, Customer A suffered approximately $280,000 in losses and Gain UK earned
$241,671.

Hil. LEGAL DISCUSSION

A. Gain UK Failed To Register as an RFED in violations of
Section 2(c)(2)(C)(iii)(D(aa) of the Act and Regulation 5.3(a)(6)(i).

The Commissionâs registration requirements for commodity professionals are a
cornerstone of the regulatory framework enacted by Congress to protect the public. See
CFTC v. British Am. Commodity Options Corp., 560 F.2d 135, 139-40 (2d Cir. 1977); see
also CFTC v. Savage, 611 F.2d 270, 280 (9th Cir. 1979). Failure to register 1s a serious
offense, and not a mere technical violations. CFTC v. Heritage Capital Advisory Servs.,
[1980-1982 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) J 21,627 at 26,387 (N.D. Ill. Nov.
8, 1982).

Section 2(c)(2)(C)(i11)()(aa) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(c)(2)(C) aii) (1) (aa) (2018),
states that a person shall not âsolicit or accept ordersâ for an agreement, contract, or
transaction in foreign currency âfrom any person that is not an eligible contract participantâ
without being âregistered in such capacity as the Commissionâ requires. Section
1a(18)(A)(x1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1a(18)(A)(xi) (2018), defines an ECP, in relevant part, as an
individual who has amounts invested on a discretionary basis, the aggregate of which exceeds
$10 million, or $5 million if the individual enters into the transaction to manage the risk
associated with an asset owned or liability incurred, or reasonably likely to be owned or incurred,
by the individual.

Regulation 5.1, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 5.1(h)(1) (2019), defines RFED as âany person that is, or
that offers to be, the counterparty to a retail forex transactionâ with someone that is not an
ECP. Regulation 5.3(a)(6)(), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 5.3(a)(6)G) (2019), requires any person that meets
the definition of RFED to register with the Commission. See, e.g., CFTC v. Interforex, 11-
cv-6203, 2012 WL 1190900, at *3 (N.D. Ill. Feb. 2, 2012) (consent order); In re Forex
Capital Markets Ltd., CFTC No. 11-18, 2011 WL 3418343, at *1 (Aug. 3, 2011) (consent
order).

During the Relevant Period, Gain UK acted as an RFED without registering with the
Commission. It was the counterparty to customers located in the United States, who were
not ECPs, in connection with leveraged retail forex transactions.

B. Gain UK Failed To Diligently Supervise the Handling of a Customerâs Retail Forex
Account in violations of Regulation 166.3.

Regulation 166.3, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 166.3 (2019), requires â[e]ach Commission registrant,
except an associated person who has no supervisory duties,â to âdiligently supervise the
handling .. . of all commodity interest accounts carried, operated, advised or introduced by
the registrant.â Under Regulation 166.3, a registrant has a âduty to develop procedures for
the âdetection and deterrence of possible wrongdoing by its agents.ââ Samson Refining Co.
v. Drexel Burnham Lambert, Inc., CFTC No. 82-R448, 1990 WL 282783, at *11 (Feb. 16,
1990) (quoting Lobb v. JT McKerr & Co., CFTC No. 85-R185, 1989 WL 242384, at *11
(Dec. 14, 1989)). Regulation 166.1 defines âCommission registrantâ as used in Part 166 as
âany person who is registered or required to be registered with the Commission.â Because
Gain UK was ârequired to be registeredâ during the Relevant Period, it was also subject to
Regulation 166.3âs supervision requirements.

A violations of Regulation 166.3 is established by showing either that: (1) the
registrantâs supervisory system was generally inadequate, or (2) the registrant failed to
perform its supervisory duties diligently. In re FCStone, LLC, CFTC No. 15-21, 2015
WL 2066891, at *3 (May 1, 2015) (consent order) (citing In re Murlas Commodities,
CFTC No. 85-29, 1995 WL 523563 (Sept. 1, 1995)). So, even if proper procedures are in
place, a supervisory violations may occur if a registrant fails to implement those
procedures, or fails to ensure that its agents follow those procedures. See, e.g., In re GNP
Commodities, CFTC No. 89-1, 1992 WL 201158, at *17 (Aug. 11, 1992) (providing that,
even if an adequate supervisory system is in place, Regulation 166.3 can still be violated if
the supervisory system is not diligently administered and stating that âa proper
determination of a FCMâs supervisory diligence must remain sensitive to the particular
facts and circumstances that influenced the design and execution of the system at issueââ),
aff'd sub nom. Monieson v. CFTC, 996 F.2d 852 (7th Cir. 1993).

Further, a violations of Regulation 166.3 is an independent violations for which no
underlying violations is necessary. FCStone, 2015 WL 2066891, at *3. Instead, evidence
of underlying violations that âshould be detected by a diligent system of supervision, either
because of the nature of the violations or because the violations have occurred repeatedlyâ
is probative of a failure to diligently supervise. CFTC v. Sidoti, 178 F.3d 1132, 1137 (11th
Cir. 1999) (defendant was liable for failure to diligently supervise because he âknew of
specific instances of misconduct yet failed to take reasonable steps to correct the
problemsâ).

Gain UK violated Regulation 166.3 by failing to follow its procedures when it did
not promptly detect the warning signs of Trading Advisorâs fraudulent conduct toward
Customer A. Among other things, Gain UK did not investigate when Customer A listed a
different account manager on her account application than the account manager listed on the
power of attorney form. Furthermore, Gain UK did not detect that Trading Advisorâwho
Gain UK previously rejected from serving as an account managerâwas directly connected
to the entity Customer A listed in her account application and that Trading Advisor had
extensive communications with its employee about Customer Aâs account. And when
Trading Advisor requested that commissions be refunded to cover losses in Customer Aâs
account, Gain UK did not adequately investigate the account activity. Trading Advisorâs
fraudulent conduct caused Customer A to lose approximately $280,000 in less than two
months of trading. Gain UK earned $241,671 in connection with its failure to diligently
supervise the handling of Customer Aâs account.

IV. FINDINGS OF violations
Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that, during the Relevant Period, Gain UK
violated Section 2(c)(2)(C)aii)(1)(aa) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(c)(2)(C) (1) (aa) (2018), and
Regulations 5.3(a)(6)(i) and 166.3, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 5.3(a)(6)G), 166.3 (2019).

            <div class=""field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item""><p style=""margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:10px""><span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""background:white""><span style=""vertical-align:baseline""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif""><b><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"">Washington, D.C. </span></b><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"">â The Commodity Futures Trading CommissionÂ today announced that the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a consent order for permanent injunction and other equitable relief against defendant <b>Brett G. Hartshorn</b> of Sarasota, Florida, finding, among other things, that he fraudulently solicited at least 13 individuals to trade off-exchange foreign currency derivatives (âforexâ) and misappropriated funds of at least two of those clients.Â  </span><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"">The order requires that he pay restitution of $890,000 and imposes permanent trading and registration bans.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:10px""><span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""background:white""><span style=""vertical-align:baseline""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"">The order findsâand Hartshorn admitsâthat from at least June 18, 2008 to in or around 2014, Hartshorn fraudulently solicited at least 13 individuals, including members of his church, as well as individuals in the local community, to trade off-exchange forex.Â  According to the order, Hartshorn falsely told most, if not all, of his clients that he had traded forex profitably on behalf of himself and others, that his clients could expect substantial profits if they permitted him to trade forex on their behalf, and that he would limit the risk of loss. In reality, Hartshorn repeatedly employed risky trading strategies and suffered significant trading lossesâoften creating devastating single-day lossesâon behalf of his clients. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:10px""><span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""background:white""><span style=""vertical-align:baseline""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"">The order finds that Hartshorn failed to disclose to clients that under his so-called âprofitâ sharing agreement with clients, he could be, and often was, compensated even as his clients lost money trading. The order also finds that Hartshorn misappropriated the funds of at least two clients and failed to disclose that misappropriation to his other clients.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""background:white""><span style=""vertical-align:baseline""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"">The order further finds that Hartshorn failed to register as a commodity trading advisor (CTA) as required under the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations and that he violated various CTA requirements, including failing to produce certain documents to the CFTC that he was required to maintain. This order resolves the CFTCâs case against Hartshorn that was filed in the Southern District of New York in 2016.

5. No Further Charges

If the Court accepts this plea agreement, the United States

complies with the provisions of USSG Â§3E1.1 (b) and all terms of this Plea

defendant understands that this recommendation or request is not binding on the
Court, and if not accepted by the Court, the defendant will not be allowed to

withdraw from the plea.

defendant certifies that defendant does hereby admit that the facts set forth below
are true, and were this case to go to trial, the United States would be able to prove
those specific facts and others beyond a reasonable doubt.

FACTS

From 2007 to in or around 2014 (the âRelevant Periodâ), Hartshom
fraudulently solicited numerous clients to invest in off-exchange foreign currency

ona leveraged, margined, or financed basis (âforexâ or âforeign currencyâ).

i

Defendant's Initials 4 att
Cas@ 520. 0602 BG EH SER DocimentiinFiÃ©d 0 H24/205/ PAGS 1 Pat Pagalp 15

During the Relevant Period, Hartshom fraudulently solicited more than
$900,000 from at least 13 individuals, Hartshorn accumulated trading losses of
over $794,000 for clients, and he received commissions totaling more than
$112,000 in connection with the fraud. Hartshorn also misappropriated more
than $57,000 of client funds.

Hartshorn typically met his victims at church or socially in his local
community. Hartshorn willfully told his clients, falsely, that he had successfully
traded foreign currency for both himself and others, but he never disclosed to
clients that he had actually suffered losses â often large single-day losses â when
trading foreign currency on behalf of other clients.

Hartshorn also willfully told clients, falsely, that he would trade their funds
in a manner te limit the risk of loss, failing to disclose his actual pattern and
history of employing risky trading strategies and incurring trading losses on behalf
of clients.

Often, Hartshorn engaged in trading strategies that resulted in margin calls
in client accounts because the account equity became too low to support the
margin requirement for open positions resulting from trades placed by Hartshorn.
âWhen these margin calls occurred, the margin calls resulted in the liquidation of

open trades and the realization of trading losses.

Hartshorn entered into a purported âprofitâ sharing arrangement with
clients but failed to disclose to clients that under that arrangement, Hartshorn
could earn fees even as the clientsâ forex investments incurred losses.

Hartshorn willfully told multiple clients, falsely, that their accounts were
performing profitably when Hartshorn knew that the clientsâ funds had been
depleted by trading losses, fees, and withdrawals by Hartshorn into Hartshornâs
personal bank account.

Hartshorn knew that all of the false statements referred to above were false
at the time he made them to clients, and those statements were material in that a
reasonable investor would have considered the statements important in deciding
whether to invest.

In addition, Hartshorn misappropriated for his own personal benefit funds
that had been entrusted to him by clients for the purpose of trading forex.
Hartshom never disclosed this misappropriation to his clients.

Hartshom, for compensation or profit, advised others as to the value or
advisability of trading forex and exercised discretionary trading authority over
accounts for or on behalf of his individual clients in connection with retail forex
transactions. Hartshorn held himself out to the public as a commodity trading
advisor, including by soliciting clients to use their funds to trade foreign currency

and to give Hartshorn discretionary authority to trade forex on their behalf.

Nevertheless, Hartshorn has never been registered with the U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in any capacity (nor was he
eligible for any registration exemption) and has not distributed disclosure
documents to clients as required by CFTC Regulation 431,17 C.F.R. Â§ 4.31. In
addition, Hartshorn solicited, accepted, or received funds from clients in
Hartshorn's name, and failed to produce certain required records to the CFTC in
violations of CFTC recordkeeping regulations.

None of the individual clients solicited by Hartshorn were eligible contract
participants, as defined by Section 1a(18)(A){xi) of the Commodity Exchange
Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ La(18)(A)(xi).

On November 7, 2018, Hartshorn was interviewed by agents of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation.

In that interview, Hartshorn stated that investor funds were always placed
in their respective investment account by the investor.

Hartshorn further stated that while he had direct access to investor
accounts for trading, he never had the ability to withdraw any of those funds for
personal use.

Hartshorn further stated that he never misappropriated any investor

money.

Moreover, Hartshorn stated that he never used any investor money for
personal reasons.

These statements to the FBI were willful and materially false.

In fact, multiple clients entrusted Hartshorn with their funds for the
purpose of trading foreign currency, rather than placing the funds in their own
respective trading accounts.

Furthermore, Hartshorn placed the funds that had been entrusted to him by
multiple clients into his personal bank account (and transferred the funds or a
portion thereof into his personal trading account); consequently, Hartshorn did
have the ability to withdraw those funds for personal use.

Moreover, Hartshorn did misappropriate the funds of certain clients.

The order also finds that Butler misled customers that he would deposit each customer payment of $5,000 or more into separate customer trading accounts, and Butler would, for a fee, manage and trade binary options on behalf of customers. Rather than trade customer funds as promised, Butler instead misappropriated most, if not all, funds for his own personal benefit, including spending tens of thousands of dollars on jewelry, purchases at an electronics store, and retail gift cards.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

and civil monetary penalty. The findings and conclusions in this Consent Order

THE PARTIES AGREE AND THE COURT HEREBY FINDS:
A. FINDINGS OF FACT
1. The Parties To This Consent Order

17. Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an
independent federal regulatory agency charged by Congress with the
administration and enforcement of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1-26 (2018), and the
Regulations promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1-190 (2019).

18. Defendant Aaron B. Butler is an individual who, from at least March
16, 2017 through February 21, 2018 (the âRelevant Periodâ), resided in Muscle
Shoals, Alabama. During the Relevant Period, Butler was the sole founder,
principal director and officer of NCI, an Alabama corporation that Butler formed
on or about June 24, 2016 with the same principal address as Butler in Muscle
Shoals, Alabama. During the Relevant Period, Butler controlled all aspects of NCI
including the day-to-day operations, marketing and trading decisions, and, at all
times during the Relevant Period, Butler acted as the sole agent for NCI. In
particular, during the Relevant Period, Butler, in his individual capacity as well as
on behalf of NCI, solicited members of the public to participate in one of two

schemes concerning trading commodity interests in binary options, primarily
Case 3:19-cv-01792-LCB Document 13 Filed 06/16/20 Page 7 of 30

involving foreign exchange traded currencies (âforexâ), on the North American
Derivatives Exchange (âNadexââ). Therefore, Butler held and exercised direct and
indirect control over NCI. Butler and NCI have never been registered with the
Commission in any capacity.

2. Butlerâs Pooled And Managed Accounts Schemes

 

19. During the Relevant Period, Butler, in his individual capacity as well
as on behalf of NCI, solicited $305,000 from more than 70 members of public to
participate in one of two schemes concerning trading binary options on Nadex, a
U.S.âbased, retailâfocused, online binary options exchange.

20. In the first scheme, Butler misrepresented that for customer deposits
of between $500 and $5,000, Butler, in his individual capacity and on behalf of
NCI, would pool that customerâs funds with other customer funds in a single
trading account at Nadex (the âPooled Schemeââ). Butler, acting as the trader for
the commodity pool operator (âCPOâ), NCI, would use those funds to trade binary
options for the benefit of the pool and its participants.

21. Inthe second scheme, Butler misrepresented that for each customer
deposit of $5,000 or more, Butler, in his individual capacity and on behalf of NCI,
would put the customerâs funds in separate customer trading accounts at Nadex
(the âManaged Accounts Schemeââ). Butler, as a commodity trading advisor

(âCTAâ), would manage and trade binary options for each customer account.
Case 3:19-cv-01792-LCB Document 13 Filed 06/16/20 Page 8 of 30

Further, Butler told customers that he would take a percentage of the profits as
compensation for managing and trading their funds.

22. Rather than trade customer funds as promised, Butler misappropriated
all customer funds for his personal benefit, and then mislead customers in order to
conceal his misappropriation.

3. Butlerâs Material Acts, Misrepresentations And Omissions To Solicit
Customers And Perpetuate The Two Schemes

23. In furtherance of the fraudulent schemes and during the Relevant
Period, Butler made material misrepresentations and omissions and created
fabricated financial statements in order to solicit customers, perpetuate the two
schemes, and hide his misappropriation.

i. Butlerâs Material Misrepresentations In Contract Guaranteeing To
Return Principal If No Profit Earned

24. First, Butler, in his individual capacity and on behalf of NCI, provided
contracts to prospective customers. Depending on if the customer executed a six
month or twelve month contract, Butler, among other things, guaranteed to return
the customersâ initial deposit of funds if no profit was earned from trading at the
end of the first six months or twelve months after execution of the contract.

25. For example, the six month contract which was entitled âNegus
Capital,â stated that Butler, on behalf of NCI, was ârequired to present the

[customer a] six-month trading [update]â on the profitability of their investment
from the date the customer first invested, and that if, at the end of the first six
months Butler did not have a profit, he, on behalf of NCI, âw[ould] be required to
return the [] investment to the [customer].â (Emphasis original).

26. Customers for both the Pooled Scheme and Managed Accounts
Scheme executed these contracts.

27. Thereafter, Butler, in his individual capacity and on behalf of NCI, did
not trade any customer funds and no profit was realized even though six months or
twelve months had passed since execution of the contracts. Therefore, Butler, on
behalf of NCI, was obligated to return to customers their funds pursuant to the
terms of the contracts. However, despite customer requests to Butler to return their
funds at the expiration of the contracts, Butler did not return those funds.

ii. Butlerâs Material Misrepresentations About His Trading Experience
And Track Record

28. Second, Butler, in his individual capacity and on behalf of NCI,
misrepresented his trading experience on Nadex and track record with respect to
trading commodities and, in particular, binary options on Nadex.

29. For example, Butler represented to customers that he had been trading
binary options for years on Nadex and was very profitable having made millions of
dollars from his trading. In reality, however, Butler traded very little in the past on
Nadex and was, for the most part, unprofitable. Specifically, Butler opened a

Nadex account in his name in 2014. From 2014 and continuing through the
Relevant Period, Butler funded that account with approximately $910. During this
time, no customer funds from Butlerâs two schemes were used to fund that
account. Further, during this time, Butler traded and lost approximately $720 in
that account.

iii. Butlerâs Material Misrepresentations About Profits

30. Third, Butler, in his individual capacity and on behalf of NCI, made
numerous material misrepresentations to customers about their supposed trading
profits.

31. For example, when Butler was soliciting prospective customers for
funds in both schemes, he told customers that depending on how much the
customer deposited, the customer could earn profits in the six- to seven-figure
range as aresult of his trading. Butler also posted supposed account statements
showing purported payouts to prior customers of Butler and NCI on a private
Facebook Group/Page he controlled. These account statements were fabricated
and, were created by Butler to induce customers to deposit funds with him and
NCI.

iv. Butlerâs Material Misrepresentations About Investment Growth

32. Fourth, Butler, in his individual capacity and on behalf of NCI,
created and distributed false growth reports to customers that purportedly showed

that the funds the customers had deposited with Butler and NCI were growing (i.e.,

10
profiting) at exceptional rates for both schemes. In reality, however, these growth
reports were false since Butler and NCI did not use customer funds to trade binary
options for either of the schemes; rather, Butler misappropriated them for his
personal benefit.
vy. Butlerâs Material Misrepresentations Concerning Nadex Statements
33. Fifth, Butler, in his individual capacity and on behalf of NCI, created
and distributed false Nadex statements to their customers of both schemes that
supposedly showed Butler requesting that Nadex transfer hundreds of thousands of
dollars from Butlerâs and NCIâs Nadex accounts to Butlerâs and NCIâs bank
accounts. In reality, however, Butler and NCI never had hundreds of thousands of
dollars in accounts at Nadex.
vi. Butlerâs Material Misrepresentations Concerning Bank Statements
34. Sixth, Butler, in his individual capacity and on behalf of NCI, created
and distributed false bank statements to their customers of both schemes that
purportedly showed Butler and NCI paying hundreds of thousands of dollars from
these bank accounts to supposedly other of Butlerâs and NCIâs customers. These
supposed payments were used by Butler, in his individual capacity and on behalf
of NCI, to show that customers were making profits because of Butlerâs and NCIâs
successful trading at Nadex. In reality, however, Butler and NCI never paid any

such returns to their customers.

11
Case 3:19-cv-01792-LCB Document 13 Filed 06/16/20 Page 12 of 30

vil. Butlerâs Material Omissions That He And NCI Would Not Trade
Customer Funds Or Misappropriate Funds

35. Seventh, Butler, in his individual capacity and on behalf of NCI,
failed to disclose to customers that he and NCI would not use customer funds from
the Pooled Scheme and Managed Accounts Scheme to trade binary options.

Butler, in his individual capacity and on behalf of NCI, also failed to disclose to
customers that he and NCI would misappropriate those funds for Butlerâs personal
benefit.

4. Customers Provide Funds To Butler And NCI To Trade Binary Options

36. Once prospective customers decided to trade binary options through
Butler and NCI, they were instructed to provide funds to Butler and NCI by
sending the funds directly to Butler.

37. For example, some customers provided funds to Butler and NCI by:
(1) using PayPal; (2) wiring funds across state lines to bank accounts in the name
of Butler; or (3) sending cashierâs checks, personal checks, and cash to Butler and
NCI which were deposited directly into Butlerâs bank accounts.

38. As aresult of Butlerâs solicitations, in his individual capacity and on
behalf of NCI, more than 70 people, including but not limited to Alabama residents
located within this District, provided Butler and NCI $305,000 in amounts ranging
from $1,000 to $20,000. These funds were to be used for the specific purpose of
trading binary options.

12
Case 3:19-cv-01792-LCB Document 13 Filed 06/16/20 Page 13 of 30

5. Butler And NCI Did Not Trade Customer Funds But Rather
Misappropriated Them For Butlerâs Personal Use

 

39. Despite receiving these funds from customers for the purpose of
trading binary options, during the Relevant Period, Butler, in his individual
capacity and on behalf of NCI, misappropriated those customersâ funds for
Butlerâs personal benefit. For example, Butler spent most of the monies that he
and NCI received on travel, entertainment, personal items, and jewelry in venues
located in Alabama and other states for Butlerâs benefit. Such purchases included
approximately $34,833.13 at various jewelry stores in Alabama and other states.
Butler also spent approximately $1,800 purchasing Toys âRâ Us gift cards.
Additionally, Butler spent over $11,000 at Apple stores.

40. During the Relevant Period, several customers, who had provided
funds to Butler and NCI to trade on their behalf, requested to make withdrawals
from their accounts with Butler and NCI. Butler, in his individual capacity and on
behalf of NCI, refused to return those funds.

6. Butlerâs Invention That Government Authorities Froze His And NCIâs
Accounts In Order To Perpetuate Fraud

 

41. As Butler, in his individual capacity and on behalf of NCI, failed to
return customer funds, customers began to post messages to the Facebook
Group/Page Butler controlled that were critical of Butler and NCI, questioning the

validity of their representations and promises.

13
Case 3:19-cv-01792-LCB Document 13 Filed 06/16/20 Page 14 of 30

42. Inresponse, Butler subsequently blocked on social media, including
the Facebook Group/Page, those customers seeking a refund of their money and
alleged that he was unable to make any refunds to those customers because his and
NCIâs bank and trading accounts had been âfrozenâ by government authorities
including the Commission.

43. Atno time during or any time after the Relevant Period has any
government authority, including the Commission, frozen any of Butlerâs and NCIâs
bank or trading accounts.

44.  Butlerâs statements about the supposed freeze were made by him with
the intent to deceive customers and conceal and perpetuate his fraud.

B. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. Jurisdiction and Venue

 

45. The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 6c of
the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2018), which provides that whenever it shall appear to

that district courts have original jurisdiction over civil actions commenced by the
United States or by any agency expressly authorized to sue by Act of Congress).

46. Venue properly lies with this Court pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the
Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(e) (2018), because Butler, in his individual capacity and on
behalf of NCI, transacted business in this District, and certain transactions, acts,
and practices alleged in the Complaint occurred, are occurring, and/or are about to
occur within this District.

2. Butler Committed Options Fraud

47. Section 4c(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6c(b) (2018), makes it unlawful

person, directly or indirectly: (a) to cheat or defraud or attempt to cheat or defraud

15

customers, in connection with Butlerâs trading binary options on his customersâ
behalf by, among other things, intentionally or recklessly: (1) misappropriating
customer funds; (2) making material misrepresentations about his trading
experience, track record, profitability, and that he, in his individual capacity and on
behalf of NCI, would actually trade binary options on Nadex; and (3) creating and
distributing to customers fabricated financial statements.

50. By the conduct described in paragraphs 17 through 44 above, Butler
held and exercised direct and indirect control over NCI and either did not act in
good faith or knowingly induced any potential violations by NCI of 7 U.S.C.

Â§ 6c(b) and 17 C.F.R. Â§ 32.4.

51. Each misappropriation, misrepresentation, omission of material fact,

and false statement, including but not limited to those specifically identified herein,

16
Case 3:19-cv-01792-LCB Document 13 Filed 06/16/20 Page 17 of 30

3. Butler Committed CTA Fraud
52. Section 40(1)(A)-(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 60(1)(A)-(B) (2018),

among other things, prohibits CTAs whether registered with the Commission or
not, by use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce,
directly or indirectly, from employing devices, schemes or artifices to defraud any
client or participant or prospective client or participant, or engaging in transactions,
practices, or courses of business which operate as a fraud or deceit upon any client
or participant or prospective client or participant.

53. By the conduct described in paragraphs 17 through 44 above, Butler,
in his individual capacity and on behalf of NCI, violated 7 U.S.C. Â§ 60(1)(A)-(B)
of the Act while acting in his capacity as a CTA for the Managed Accounts
Scheme, because he, among other things, intentionally or recklessly:

(1) misappropriated customer funds; (2) made material misrepresentations about
his trading experience, track record, profitability, and that he, in his individual
capacity and on behalf of NCI, would actually trade binary options on Nadex; and
(3) created and distributed to customers fabricated financial statements.

57. Section 1(a)(12) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1a(12) (2018) defines a CTA,
in relevant part, as âany person who, for compensation or profit, engages in the

purported trading of the Managed Accounts Schemeâs customers.

59. By the conduct described in paragraphs 17 through 44 above, Butler
used the mails or other means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce in

connection with the Managed Accounts Schemeâs business.

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT:

61. Based upon and in connection with the foregoing conduct, pursuant to

violations of 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6c(b), 6m(1), and 60(1)(A)-(B) (2018) and 17 C.F.R.

Â§ 32.4 (2019).

62. Butler is also permanently restrained, enjoined, and prohibited from

is defined by Section la(40) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1a(40) (2018));

b. Entering into any transactions involving âcommodity interestsâ (as
that term is defined in Regulation 1.3, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.3 (2019)), for
accounts held in the name of Butler or NCI or for accounts in which
Butler or NCI has a direct or indirect interest;

c. Having any commodity interests traded on Butlerâs or NCIâs behalf;

19
d. Controlling or directing the trading for or on behalf of any other

4.14(a)(9).
V. RESTITUTION AND CIVIL MONETARY PENALTY
A. Restitution
63. Butler shall pay restitution in the amount of three hundred and five
thousand dollars ($305,000.00) (âRestitution Obligationâ), representing the gains

he received in connection with the violations described herein, plus post-judgment

20
interest. However, should NCI be found liable in connection with the Complaint
and is ordered to pay restitution for its misconduct, then the Restitution Obligation
in this Consent Order will become joint and several with any restitution ordered
against NCI.

64. Post-judgment interest shall accrue on the Restitution Obligation
beginning on the date of entry of this Consent Order and shall be determined by
using the Treasury Bill rate prevailing on the date of entry of this Consent Order
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1961 (2018).

65. To effect payment of the Restitution Obligation and the distribution of
any restitution payments to customers of Butler and NCI, the Court appoints the
National Futures Association (âNFAââ), a self-regulatory organization for the U.S.
derivatives industry that the CFTC designated as a registered futures association,
as Monitor (âMonitorâ). The Monitor shall receive restitution payments from
Butler and make distributions as set forth below. Because the Monitor is acting as
an officer of this Court in performing these services, the NFA shall not be liable
for any action or inaction arising from NFAâs appointment as Monitor, other than
actions involving fraud.

66. Butler shall make Restitution Obligation payments under this Consent
Order to the Monitor in the name âCFTC v. Aaron B. Butler, et al. -â

Settlement/Restitution Fund.â Butler shall send such Restitution Obligation

21
payments by electronic funds transfer, or by U.S. postal money order, certified
check, bank cashierâs check, or bank money order, to the Office of Administration,
National Futures Association, 300 South Riverside Plaza, Suite 1800, Chicago,
Illinois 60606 under cover letter that identifies him as the paying Defendant and
the name and docket number of this proceeding. Butler shall simultaneously
transmit copies of the cover letter and the form of payment to the Chief Financial
Officer, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155
21st Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20581 and James Deacon, Senior Trial
Attorney, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Division of Enforcement,
1155 21* Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20581.

67. The Monitor shall oversee the Restitution Obligation and shall have
the discretion to determine the manner of distribution of such funds in an equitable
fashion to customers of Butler and NCI identified by the Commission or may defer
distribution until such time as the Monitor deems appropriate. In the event that the
amount of Restitution Obligation payments to the Monitor are of a de minimis
nature such that the Monitor determines that the administrative cost of making a
distribution to eligible customers is impractical, the Monitor may, in its discretion,
treat such restitution payments as civil monetary penalty payments, which the
Monitor shall forward to the Commission following the instructions for civil

monetary penalty payments set forth in Part V.B. below.

22
68. Butler shall cooperate with the Monitor as appropriate to provide such

The judgment also imposes permanent trading and registration bans on the defendants and prohibits them from violating provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act, as charged. This judgment resulted from a CFTC complaint filed on September 9, 2019 that charged the defendants with fraud, misappropriation, and failing to register with the Commission as required. [See CFTC Press Release No. <a href=""https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8004-19"" style=""color:blue; text-decoration:underline"">8004-19</a>] The court found that the defendantsâ failure to respond to the complaint amounts to an admission of the complaintâs allegations.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

On June 19, 2020, he was sentenced to 24 months in prison and ordered to pay more than $950,000 in restitution. [See <i>U.S. v. Carducci</i>, 6:19-cr-00469-BHH (D.S.C.)]</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""border:none windowtext 1.0pt; font-size:12.0pt; padding:0in""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"">As alleged in the complaint, s</span></span><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"">tarting in at least August 2016, defendants fraudulently solicited and misappropriated money from at least 30 individuals for pooled trading in retail foreign exchange (forex). In addition, between August 2016 and September 2018, the defendants received at least $1.1 million from pool participants for commodity pools that would purportedly trade forex. However, the defendants never traded forex on behalf of pool participants, but instead misappropriated the majority of funds to pay Carducciâs personal expenses and to support his lavish lifestyle. Defendants concealed the fraud by issuing false account statements to participants.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"">In order to entice potential participants to deposit funds with them, the defendants falsely represented that, among other things, they had a history of making large profits from trading forex and they maintained a forex trading account with a registered foreign exchange dealer that held $12 million under defendantsâ management. The defendants also falsely asserted that that they would trade forex on behalf of pool participants that would yield profits of up to 18% per month without suffering any losses. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p class=""MsoNoSpacing""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"">Additionally, the defendants falsely claimed that pool participants could withdraw their funds upon request. In actuality, they ignored pool participantsâ withdrawal requests and lied about the conditions that purportedly prevented the return of participantsâ funds. The defendants also sent<span style=""border:none windowtext 1.0pt; padding:0in""> fraudulent account statements to pool participants claiming they were making money from forex trading when no trades were ever executed.</span> </span></span></span></span></p>

The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers and to ensure the wrongdoers are held accountable.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING
COMMISSION,
Plaintiff, 19-cv-8351 (PKC)
-against- DEFAULT JUDGMENT
DOMINICK VINCENT CARDUCCI and VOS
CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, LLC,
Defendants.
=< xX

CASTEL, U.S.D.J.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCFTCâ) filed the Complaint in this
action on September 9, 2019. (Docket # 3.) The CFTC filed affidavits of service stating that the
summons and complaint were personally served on defendant Dominick Carducci on October 5,
2019, and that Vos Capital Management, LLC (âVosâ) was served through an agent on September
13, 2019. (Docket # 10, 11.) Defendants have not appeared in this case, and on November 5,
2019, the Clerk of Court issued Certificates of Default as to both defendants. (Docket # 30, 31.)
The CFTC represents that on June 19, 2020, Carducci was sentenced in the District of South
Carolina to 24 monthsâ imprisonment and restitution totaling more than $900,000 in connection

with the same scheme that is the subject of this case. United States v. Carducci, 19 Cr. 469 (BHH)

 

(D.S.C.) (Docket # 55).
The CFTC moved for entry of default judgment on January 23, 2020. (Docket #
34.) Because defendants have not answered or appeared, the motion for entry of default judgment

is granted.
Case 1:19-cv-08351-PKC Document 45 Filed 06/23/20 Page 2 of 9

âIt is an âancient common law axiomâ that a defendant who defaults thereby admits
all âwell-pleadedâ factual allegations contained in the complaint.â City of New York v. Mickalis
Pawn Shop, LLC, 645 F.3d 114, 137 (2d Cir. 2011) (quoting Vermont Teddy Bear Co. v. 1-800
Beargram Co., 373 F.3d 241, 246 (2d Cir. 2004)). The allegations of the Complaint are therefore
deemed to have been admitted by the defendants. Because the default amounts to an admission of
the Complaintâs allegations, the Court need not engaged in the fact-finding exercise proposed by
the CFTC.

As a consequence of defendantsâ default, the following relief is ordered:

I. Permanent Injunctive Relief.

1. Pursuant to Section 6c of the Commodity Exchange Act (the âActâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§
13a-1 (2018), Carducci is permanently restrained, enjoined and prohibited from directly or
indirectly engaging in conduct in violations of Sections 4b(a)(2)(A)-(C), 40(1),
2(c)(2)(C)i)(1)(cc), and 4k(2) of the Act and Regulations 5.2(b) and 5.3(a)(2)(11).

2. Pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2018), VOS Capital is
permanently restrained, enjoined and prohibited from directly or indirectly engaging in conduct in
violations of Sections 4b(a)(2)(A)-(C), 40(1), 2(c)(2)(C)ai)(1)(cc), and 4m(1) of the Act and
Regulations 5.2(b) and 5.3(a)(2)(1).

3. Defendants are permanently restrained, enjoined and prohibited from, directly or
indirectly:

a. Trading on or subject to the rules of any registered entity (as that term is
defined by Section 1a(40) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1a(40) (2018));
b. Entering into any transactions involving âcommodity interestsâ (as that

term is defined in Regulation 1.3(yy), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.3(yy) (2019)), for
Case 1:19-cv-08351-PKC Document 45 Filed 06/23/20 Page 3 of 9

accounts held in the name of any Defendant or for accounts in which any
Defendant has a direct or indirect interest;

C. Having any commodity interests traded on any Defendantâs behalf;

d. Controlling or directing the trading for or on behalf of any other person or
entity, whether by power of attorney or otherwise, in any account involving
commodity interests;

â¬. Soliciting, receiving, or accepting any funds from any person for the
purpose of purchasing or selling of any commodity interests;

f. Applying for registration or claiming exemption from registration with the
Commission in any capacity, and engaging in any activity requiring such
registration or exemption from registration with the Commission except as
provided for in Regulation 4.14(a)(9), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 4.14(a)(9) (2019); and

g. Acting as a principal (as that term is defined in Regulation 3.1(a), 17
C.F.R. Â§ 3.1(a) (2019)), agent, or any other officer or employee of any
person registered, exempted from registration, or required to be registered
with the Commission except as provided for in Regulation 4.14(a)(9), 17
C.F.R. Â§ 4.14(a)(Q9).

II. Restitution and Civil Monetary Penalties.

 

A. Restitution.
1. Pursuant to Section 6c(d)(3)(A) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(d)(3)(A) (2018),
Carducci and VOS Capital shall pay, jointly and severally, restitution in the amount of $953,875

(the âRestitution Obligationâ). Ifthe Restitution Obligation is not paid immediately, post-
judgment interest shall accrue on the Restitution Obligation beginning on the date of entry of this
Order and Default Judgment (this âOrderâ) and shall be determined by using the Treasury Bill rate
prevailing on the date of entry of this Order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1961.

2. To effect payment of the Restitution Obligation and the distribution of any
restitution payments to Defendantsâ customers, the Court appoints the National Futures Association
(âNFAâ) as Monitor (âMonitorâ). The Monitor shall collect restitution payments from Defendants
and make distributions as set forth below. Because the Monitor is acting as an officer of this Court
in performing these services, NFA shall not be liable for any action or inaction arising from NFAâs
appointment as Monitor, other than actions involving fraud.

3. Defendants shall make Restitution Obligation payments, and any post-judgment
interest payments, under this Order to the Monitor in the name âDominick Vincent Carducci and
VOS Capital Management, LLC â Restitution Fundâ and shall send such Restitution Obligation
payments by electronic funds transfer, or by U.S. postal money order, certified check, bank
cashierâs check, or bank money order, to the Office of Administration, National Futures
Association, 300 South Riverside Plaza, Suite 1800, Chicago, Illinois 60606 under cover letter that
identifies the paying Defendants and the name and docket number of this proceeding. Defendants
shall simultaneously transmit copies of the cover letter and the form of payment to the Chief
Financial Officer, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st
Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20581.

4. The Monitor shall oversee the Restitution Obligation and shall have the discretion
to determine the manner of distribution of such funds in an equitable fashion to Defendantsâ Pool
Participants identified by the Commission or may defer distribution until such time as the Monitor
deems appropriate. In the event that the amount of Restitution Obligation payments to the Monitor

are of a de minimis nature such that the Monitor determines that the administrative cost of making
Case T:19-cy-GQR8R351-PkKeE anrimernr JR Ever OB/FRIO Pane SS af a
Naw CANS atin ie WOR TU Ne LAPEER ER Sra? POESSD AA ASA cade Ae Po CALANS ao AR
u

a distribution to eligible pool participants is impractical, the Monitor may, in its discretion, treat
such restitution payments as civil monetary penalty payments, which the Monitor shall forward to
the Commission following the instructions for civil monetary penalty payments set forth in Section
II.B below.

5. Defendants shall cooperate with the Monitor as appropriate to provide such
information as the Monitor deems necessary and appropriate to identify Defendantsâ Pool
Participants to whom the Monitor, in its sole discretion, may determine to include in any plan for
distribution of any Restitution Obligation payments. Defendants shall execute any documents
necessary to release funds that they have in any repository, bank, investment or other financial
institution, wherever located, in order to make partial or total payment toward the Restitution
Obligation.

6. The Monitor shall provide the Commission at the beginning of each calendar year
with a report detailing the disbursement of funds to Defendantsâ Pool Participants during the
previous year. The Monitor shall transmit this report under a cover letter that identifies the name
and docket number of this proceeding to the Chief Financial Officer, Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20581, and David
W. MacGregor, Chief Trial Attorney, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 140 Broadway,
19th Floor, New York, NY 10005.

7. The amounts payable to each Pool Participant shall not limit the ability of any
participant from proving that a greater amount is owed from Defendants or any other person or
entity, and nothing herein shall be construed in any way to limit or abridge the rights of any

customer that exist under state or common law.
Case 1:19-cv-08351-PKC Document 45 Filed 06/23/20 Page 6 of 9

8. Pursuant to FRCP 71, each Pool Participant who suffered a loss is explicitly made
an intended third-party beneficiary of this Order and may seek to enforce obedience of this Order to
obtain satisfaction of any portion of the restitution that has not been paid by Defendants to ensure
continued compliance with any provision of this Order and to hold Defendants in contempt for any
violations of any provision of this Order.

9. To the extent that any funds accrue to the U.S. Treasury for satisfaction of
Defendantsâ Restitution Obligation, such funds shall be transferred to the Monitor for disbursement
in accordance with the procedures set forth above.

10. Defendants will obtain a dollar-for-dollar credit against this Restitution Obligation
as a result of any restitution payments made by Carducci in connection with the case captioned

United States v. Carducci, 19 Cr. 469 (BHH) (D.S.C.).

 

B. â Civil Monetary Penalty.

11. Pursuant to Section 6c(d)(1)(A) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(d)(1)(A) (2018),
Defendants shall, jointly and severally, pay a civil monetary penalty in the amount of $2,861,625
(the âCMP Obligationâ), which is equivalent to triple the monetary gain to Defendants from their
violationsâ1.e., three times the gross amount of Pool Participant funds obtained by Defendants less
the amount of funds returned to Pool Participants. If the CMP Obligation is not paid immediately,
then post-judgment interest shall accrue on the CMP Obligation beginning on the date of entry of
this Order and shall be determined by using the Treasury Bill rate prevailing on the date of entry of
this Order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1961.

12. Defendants shall pay their CMP Obligation by electronic funds transfer, U.S.

postal money order, certified check, bank cashierâs check, or bank money order. If payment is to
Case 1:19-cv-08351-PKC Document 45 Filed 06/23/20 Page 7 of 9

be made other than by electronic funds transfer, then the payment shall be made payable to the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission and sent to the address below:

Commodity Futures Trading Commission Division of Enforcement
6500 S. MacArthur Blvd.

HQ Room 181

Oklahoma City, OK 73169

(405) 954-6569 office

(405) 954-1620 fax

9-AMC-AR-CFTC@faa.gov

 

If payment by electronic funds transfer is chosen, Defendants shall contact Marie
Thorne or her successor at the address above to receive payment instructions and shall fully
comply with those instructions. Defendants shall accompany payment of the CMP Obligation
with a cover letter that identifies the paying Defendant and the name and docket number of this
proceeding.

Defendants shall simultaneously transmit copies of the cover letter and the form of
payment to the Chief Financial Officer, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Three
Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20581, and David W. MacGregor,
Chief Trial Attorney, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 140 Broadway, 19th Floor, New
York, NY 10005.

III. Miscellaneous Provisions.

 

1. Acceptance by the Commission or the Monitor of any partial payment of
Defendantsâ Restitution Obligation or CMP Obligation shall not be deemed a waiver of their
obligation to make further payments pursuant to this Order, or a waiver of the Commissionâs
right to seek to compel payment of any remaining balance.

2. The injunctive and equitable relief provisions of this Order shall be binding upon

Defendants, upon any person under the authority or control of any Defendant, and upon any
Case 1:19-cv-08351-PKC Document 45 Filed 06/23/20 Page 8 of 9

person who receives actual notice of this Order, by personal service, email, facsimile or

4. Until such time as Defendants satisfy in full their Restitution Obligation and
CMP Obligation as set forth in this Order, Defendants shall provide written notice to the
Commission by certified mail of any change to their telephone number and mailing address
within ten calendar days of the change.

5. If any provision of this Order or if the application of any provision or
circumstance is held invalid, then the remainder of this Order and the application of the provision

to any other person or circumstance shall not be affected by the holding.

<h1>CFTC Charges New Mexico Resident with Fraud in Long-Running Ponzi Scheme</h1>

<p style=""margin:0in 0in 10pt""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""line-height:115%""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><b><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""line-height:115%""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"">Washington, DC</span></span></span></b><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""line-height:115%""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;""> â The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced it has filed a civil enforcement action in the District of New Mexico against defendant <b>Douglas Lien</b> (d/b/a <b>Westend Investments</b>) of Santa Fe, New Mexico, charging him with fraud and failing to register with the CFTC.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin:0in 0in 10pt""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""line-height:115%""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""line-height:115%""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"">According to the complaint, starting in at least 2002, Lien solicited and accepted funds from friends and acquaintances for the purpose of trading commodity futures contracts, primarily U.S. Treasury bond futures. The complaint alleges that since at least September 2014, Lien accepted at least $827,650 from his clients, issued periodic account statements showing false trading profits, and reported more than $1.6 million in profits on annual tax forms he issued to clients. In reality, during that time, Lien made no deposits into his futures trading account and placed only three trades in commodity futures contracts, for a combined loss of approximately $200, according to the complaint. The complaint also alleges that Lien misappropriated client funds, using them to pay other clients, in the manner of a Ponzi scheme, and for management fees he charged based on false trading profits. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin:0in 0in 10pt""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""line-height:115%""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""line-height:115%""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"">The complaint further alleges that throughout 2019, several of Lienâs clients have requested the return of their funds, but Lien has strung clients along with false excuses. According to the complaint, Lien falsely advised clients that a broker placed client funds in long-term investments that Lien cannot access without incurring penalties, when, in fact, no client funds are, or were, locked up in such investments. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin:0in 0in 10pt""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""line-height:115%""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""line-height:115%""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"">Additionally, the complaint charges that Lien acted in a capacity requiring him to register with the CFTC and that he failed to do so.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin:0in 0in 10pt""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""line-height:115%""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""line-height:115%""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"">In its continuing litigation, the CFTC seeks restitution to defrauded investors, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, civil monetary penalties, permanent trading and registration bans, and a permanent injunction against further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act, as charged.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW MEXICO

 

COMMODITY FUTURES
TRADING COMMISSION,

Plaintiff, Case No:

Vv.

DOUGLAS LIEN, individually and d/b/a Hon.

 

WESTEND INVESTMENTS,

Defendant.

 

 

COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, CIVIL MONETARY
PENALTIES, AND OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF

 

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCFTCâ or âCommissionââ), an
independent federal agency, by and through its attorneys hereby alleges as follows:

I. INTRODUCTION

1. Between at least September 2014 and the present (âRelevant Periodâ), Defendant
Douglas Lien (âLienââ), individually and doing business as (âd/b/aâ) Westend Investments,
fraudulently accepted funds from friends and acquaintances, telling them he would trade their
funds in U.S. Treasury bond futures contracts in individual accounts. Throughout the Relevant
Period, Lien issued to clients periodic account statements and annual tax forms that showed
profits. But in late 2018, Lien began to evade client requests for their funds. He told at least one
client that before having surgery in late 2018, he placed client funds under management with a
broker at a futures commission merchant (âFCMâ) in Chicago (âFCM Aâ), where the funds are

locked up in long-term investments.
Mase P:19-cv-O1153 Bocurnent 1 Filed 12/O@/19 Page Satis

2. In reality, Lienâs clientsâ funds are not locked up in long-term investments at
FCM A. During the Relevant Period, Lien accepted at least $827,650 from clients but did not
trade those funds in commodity futures contracts, as promised. Instead, during the Relevant
Period, Lien made no deposits into his futures trading account at FCM A, the only FCM at which
Lien maintained a futures trading account during the Relevant Period, and placed only three
trades in commodity futures contracts, for a combined loss of approximately $200. His futures
trading account maintained a balance of approximately $25,000 from at least January 31, 2013,
until March 2019, when he withdrew $23,000, and his account balance was approximately
$1,880 as of August 2019.

3. During the Relevant Period, Lien made material misrepresentations to his clients
about trading their funds in commodity futures contracts and about the location of their funds,
issued clients false account statements and tax forms that showed fictitious trading profits, and
misappropriated client funds.

4. By engaging in this conduct and the conduct further described herein, Lien has
engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in certain violations of the Commodity Exchange Act
(âActâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1-26 (2012). Specifically, Lien has engaged, is engaging, or is about to
engage in violations of Section 4b(a)(1)(A)-(C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6b(a)(1)(A)-(C) (2012),
which makes it unlawful to cheat or defraud or attempt to cheat or defraud another person, to
willfully make or cause to be made false statements to another person, and to willfully deceive or
attempt to deceive another person in connection with commodity futures. Furthermore, by
accepting funds from clients to margin, guarantee, or secure commodity futures trades, Lien

acted as a futures commission merchant (âFCMâ) without being registered with the CFTC,
Mase P:19-cv-O1153 Docurnent 1 Filed 12/O@/19 Page 2oafis

escaping regulatory scrutiny into his activities and violating Section 4d(a)(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
Â§ 6d(a)(1) (2012).

5. Unless immediately restrained and enjoined by this Court, Lien is likely to
continue engaging in the acts and practices alleged in this Complaint, and funds he fraudulently
obtained may be misappropriated or otherwise dissipated. Accordingly, the CFTC brings this
action pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2012), to enjoin Lienâs unlawful acts
and practices and to compel his compliance with the Act. The CFTC also seeks civil monetary
penalties and remedial ancillary relief, including restitution to defrauded clients, disgorgement,
pre- and post-judgment interest, and such other equitable relief as this Court may deem necessary
and appropriate.

I. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

6. Jurisdiction. This Court has jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1331
(2012) (codifying federal question jurisdiction) and 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1345 (2012) (providing that U.S.
district courts have original jurisdiction over civil actions commenced by the United States or by
any agency expressly authorized to sue by Act of Congress). In addition, Section 6c(a) of the
Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(a) (2012), provides that US. district courts have jurisdiction to hear
actions brought by the Commission for injunctive and other relief or to enforce compliance with
the Act whenever it shall appear to the Commission that any person has engaged, is engaging, or
is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a violations of any provision of the Act or
any rule, regulation, or order thereunder.

7. Venue. Venue properly lies with this Court pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act,
7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(e) (2012), because Lien transacted business in this District, and certain of the
acts and practices in violations of the Act have occurred, are occurring, or are about to occur

within this District, among other places.

Hil. PARTIES

8. Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an independent federal
regulatory agency charged by Congress with administering and enforcing the Act and CFTC
Regulations (âRegulationsâ), 17 C.F.R. pts. 1-190 (2019).

9. Defendant Douglas Lien resides in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Lien has never been
registered with the CFTC in any capacity.

10. | Westend Investments is a business name Lien used, including in one of his email
addresses and in account agreements with clients. Lien did not formally incorporate Westend
Investments or form it as a limited liability company, nor did Lien maintain any futures trading
accounts in the name of Westend Investments at any FCM registered with the CFTC. Westend
Investments has never been registered with the CFTC in any capacity.

IV. LIENâS LONG-RUNNING FRAUD

11. Lien maintains a futures trading account in his own name at FCM A, an FCM
registered with the CFTC. Lien originally opened his trading account at a different registered
FCM (âFCM Bâ) in 2001, and Lienâs original account opening paperwork includes a November
25, 2001, letter to FCM B signed by Lien that states, âthis is to confirm that all the funds in my
account are my own and will be traded only at my discretion.â Lienâs account was ultimately
acquired by FCM A in 2012, and his personal trading account has remained open there since,
including throughout the Relevant Period.

12. Starting in at least 2002, Lien solicited and accepted funds from friends and
acquaintances for the purpose of trading their funds in commodity futures contracts, primarily
U.S. Treasury bond futures.

13. Lien did not disclose to clients or prospective clients that he was not registered

with the CFTC as an FCM.
Mase P:19-cv-O1153 Bocurnent 1 Filed 12/O@/19 Page Satis

14. Lien typically entered into an account agreement with each new client on
letterhead stating âDouglas Lienâ or âDouglas Lien / westend investments.â A typical agreement
stated that the clientâs funds would be traded, that Lien would reinvest monthly income by
adding it to client equity, and that Lienâs fee would be 15% of net trading profits each month,
calculated as gross trading profits minus broker commissions. No provision in the agreement
gave Lien the right to receive any other fees or funds from the clientâs account.

15. Until approximately 2010 or 2011, Lien instructed clients to wire funds to a bank
account in the name of âDouglas Lien / westend investmentsâ at a bank in Santa Fe, New
Mexico. After that, and during the Relevant Period, Lien instructed clients to wire funds to an
account in Lienâs name at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. ending in 8968.

16. Lien socialized with his clients over the years, even inviting some of his clients to
vacation with him and his wife on a private family-owned island near Marthaâs Vineyard, and
many of Lienâs clients viewed him as a friend.

17. For years, including during the Relevant Period, Lien led his clients to believe
that he profitably traded their funds, including by issuing clients periodic account statements and
annual tax forms showing profits.

18. Lien typically emailed or hand delivered to his clients account statements on a
monthly or quarterly basis. Client account statements were usually sent as Word documents on
letterhead stating âDouglas Lien.â The statements were individualized and reflected account
balances, profits, deposits or withdrawals, Lienâs 15% management fees, and sometimes
corrections or adjustments to prior statements. Lien typically included market commentary in his
statements, and he sometimes added personal notes to clients about health, family, vacation

plans, and other topics.
Mase P:19-cv-O1153 Docurnent 1 Filed 12/O@/19 Page Goafis

19. Lien also emailed or hand delivered to his clients annual tax forms, primarily
handwritten Form 1099s, showing profits of as much as hundreds of thousands of dollars. The
tax forms typically listed as the payer name âDouglas H. Lien,â and some of them included as a
descriptor âRegulated Futures Contracts.â As with the periodic account statements, each tax
form was individualized, reporting only a single clientâs profits.

20. For example, in March 2016, Lien emailed Client A an account statement for the
month of January 2016. The statement reported a month-end account balance of $2,502,609,
monthly âTrade/Investmentâ profits of $22,797, and Lienâs 15% management fee on those
profits, totaling $3,552. Lienâs commentary in the statement included a congratulatory statement
to Client A for exceeding a $2.5 million balance: âYou finally made it. (I think I should have a
silver â not Gold â pin made for you that signifies that you are now a member of a very select
club.).â The following year, Lien emailed Client A a handwritten Form 1099 that reported his
2016 profit as $235,615 and included the description âRegulated Futures Contracts.â

21. Lien accepted at least $827,650 funds from clients during the Relevant Period,
and he reported more than $1.6 million in profits on tax forms he issued to clients during the
Relevant Period.

22. However, at least during the Relevant Period, the account statements and tax
forms that Lien sent his clients did not reflect Lienâs actual futures trading results, but instead
showed fake trading profits and management fees that Lien charged on those fake profits.

23. Lien maintained a trading account balance of approximately $25,000 from at least
January 31, 2013, shortly after FCM A acquired Lienâs account, until March 2019. During the
Relevant Period, Lien made no deposits into his trading account and placed only three trades:

two trades in U.S. Treasury bond futures in 2017 and one trade in mini-corn futures in 2019,
Mase P:19-cv-O1153 Bocurnent 1 Filed 12/O@/19 Page Fotis
resulting in a combined net loss of approximately $200. In March 2019, Lien withdrew $23,000
of his account balance with instructions to wire the funds to a bank account in his name at
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. ending in 8968. Lienâs current account balance at FCM A is
approximately $1,880.

24. During the Relevant Period, Lien maintained no other futures trading accounts in
his name at FCM A or any other FCM registered with the CFTC, nor did he maintain any futures
trading accounts in the name of âWestend Investmentsâ at any FCM registered with the CFTC.

25. Throughout 2019, several of Lienâs clients have requested the return of all or a
portion of their funds. While Lien has returned some of the funds requested, he has failed to
disclose to clients that on multiple occasions, he paid clients using funds he received from other
clients, in the manner of a Ponzi scheme, or using funds he obtained from equity lines of credit,
and not using funds from clientsâ own account balances or trading profits. He has otherwise
strung clients along with false excuses or simply ignored them.

26. For example, in 2019, Clients A and B requested funds from their accounts. Lien
paid them a portion of the funds they requested in April 2019 using funds obtained from another
client, in the manner of a Ponzi scheme, without disclosing the source of those funds. As of mid-
June, Clients A and B had still not received the remainder of the funds they had requested. At
various points, including on approximately April 24, May 25, and June 18, 2019, Lien sent
Client A emails in which he blamed his delay in returning their funds in part on a change in
brokers, claiming that his old broker had left for another brokerage job and that his new broker
did not understand instructions delivered over the phone. These representations were false. No

FCM A broker managed funds for Lien or his clients during the Relevant Period.
Mase P:19-cv-O1153 Docurnent 1 Filed 12/O@/19 Page Batis

27. Lien also told at least one of his clients that, prior to having heart surgery in
August 2018, he placed client funds under management with an FCM A broker, who had placed
the funds in long-term investments that Lien could not access without incurring penalties. These
representations were also false. Neither Lienâs nor his clientsâ funds are, or were, locked up in
long-term investments at FCM A.

28. At least during the Relevant Period, Lien misappropriated client funds, including
client funds he used to pay other clients and management fees that he charged based on fake
trading profits.

and in connection therewith, âaccepts any money, securities, or property (or extends credit in lieu
thereof) to margin, guarantee, or secure any trades or contracts that result or may result
therefrom.â

<h1>CFTC Orders HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. Pay $1.6 Million Penalty for Spoofing In the Precious Metals Futures Markets</h1>

<h3>CFTC recognizes HSBCâs Cooperation and Substantial Assistance in the Investigation</h3>

<p><b>Washington, DC</b>Â - The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today issued an Order filing and settling charges againstÂ <b>HSBC Securities (USA) Inc</b>. (HSBC) for engaging in numerous acts of spoofing with respect to certain futures products in gold and other precious metals traded on the Commodity Exchange, Inc. (COMEX). The Order finds that HSBC engaged in this activity through one of its traders based in HSBCâs New York office.</p>

<p>The Order requires HSBC to pay a civil monetary penalty of $1.6 million, to cease and desist from violating the Commodity Exchange Actâs prohibition against spoofing, and to take specified steps to implement and strengthen their training, systems, and controls to detect and deter spoofing by HSBC personnel in the futures markets. In accepting HSBCâs offer of settlement, the CFTC recognizes the bankâs cooperation during the Division of Enforcementâs investigation of this matter.</p>

<p><b>CFTCâs Director of Enforcement Comments</b></p>

<p>James McDonald, the CFTCâs Director of Enforcement, commented: âSpoofing poses a significant threat to the integrity of our markets and to law-abiding market participants.Â  Thatâs why the CFTC is committed to vigilantly investigating and prosecuting this sort of misconduct.Â  While we expect market participants to adhere to the rules and regulations governing market conduct, this case also serves as an example of the value of substantial cooperation when wrongdoing is discovered.Â  HSBC cooperated throughout this investigation, and benefitted from its cooperation in the form of a substantially reduced penalty.â</p>

<p>The Order specifically finds that from at least July 16, 2011, through August 2014, HSBC, by and through one of its traders, engaged in spoofing with respect to certain futures products in gold and other precious metals traded on COMEX. Specifically, the Order finds that the trader placed orders for futures contracts in precious metals, primarily gold, with the intent to cancel before their execution. The traderâs spoofing strategy frequently involved placing a relatively small bid or offer with the intent to execute that order (Resting Order) and, prior to the execution of the Resting Order, placing a larger order (or multiple orders), which the trader intended to cancel before execution, on the opposite side of the same market (Spoof Order). Generally, the trader would receive a partial or complete fill of the Resting Order and cancel the Spoof Order before it was filled. The Order finds that this spoofing conduct violated the Commodity Exchange Act.</p>

<p>The CFTC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigations, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Inc., and the UK Financial Conduct Authority.</p>

<p>This case is brought in connection with the CFTC Division of Enforcementâs Spoofing Task Force, and the staff members responsible for this case are Katie Rasor, Lara Turcik, Brandon Wozniak, Alben Weinstein, Candice Aloisi, Patryk J. Chudy, Lenel Hickson, Jr. and Manal M. Sultan.</p>

ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTION 6(c) AND (d) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, MAKING
FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL sanctions

I.
INTRODUCTION

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ) has reason to believe that
HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., (ââHSBCâ or âRespondentââ) has violated Section 4c(a)(5)(C) of the
Commodity Exchange Act (the âActâ or âCEAââ), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6c(a)(5)(C) (2012). Therefore, the
Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest that public administrative
proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted to determine whether Respondent engaged in the
violations set forth herein and to determine whether any order should be issued imposing
remedial sanctions.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Respondent has
submitted an Offer of Settlement (âOfferâ), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Without admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, Respondent consents to
the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 6(c) and 6(d) of the
Commodity Exchange Act, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial sanctions (âOrderâ), and
acknowledges service of this Order.â

 

' Respondent consents to the use of these findings and conclusions in this Order in this proceeding and in any other
proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party or claimant, and agrees that they shall
be taken as true and correct and be given preclusive effect therein, without further proof. Respondent does not
consent, however, to the use of this Order, or the findings or conclusions herein, as the sole basis for any other
proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party, other than a proceeding in
bankruptcy or receivership or a proceeding to enforce the terms of this Order. Respondent does not consent to the
II.
FINDINGS
The Commission finds the following:
A. SUMMARY

From at least July 16, 2011, through August 2014, (the âRelevant Periodâ), HSBC, by
and through one of its traders (âTrader Aââ), engaged in the disruptive trading practice of
âspoofingâ (bidding or offering with the intent to cancel the bid or offer before execution) with
respect to certain futures products in gold and other precious metals (âPrecious Metalsââ) traded
on the Commodity Exchange, Inc. (âCOMEXââ). This spoofing conduct violated Section
4c(a)(5)(C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6c(a)(5)(C) (2012).

** ** ** ** **

In accepting the Respondentâs Offer, the Commission recognizes the Respondentâs
significant cooperation with the Division of Enforcementâs (âDivisionââ) investigation of this
matter, which is explained in more detail below. The Commission notes that Respondentâs
cooperation and remediation is reflected in the form of a substantially reduced penalty.

B. RESPONDENT

HSBC is an indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC Holdings PLC, a global
banking and financial services company headquartered in London. Throughout the Relevant
Period, HSBC maintained its principal office in New York and, in the course of its business
activities, traded futures contracts in the United States. HSBC has been registered with the
Commission as a futures commission merchant (âFCMâ) since 1980.

C. FACTS
1. HSBCâs Disruptive Trading

During the Relevant Period, a number of traders, including Trader A, were employed in
HSBCâs New York office. As part of his duties, Trader A placed orders and entered into
transactions for futures contracts in Precious Metals, which were traded on the COMEX, a
futures exchange and designated contract market which is owned and operated by CME Group,
Inc. (âCMEâ). Trader A made a market for precious metals derivatives products and traded
futures principally to hedge customer orders with the aim of profitably managing his deskâs
overall position.

On numerous occasions during the Relevant Period, Trader A placed orders for futures
contracts in Precious Metals, primarily gold, with the intent to cancel before their execution.
Trader Aâs spoofing strategy frequently involved placing a relatively small bid or offer with the

 

use of the Offer or this Order, or the findings or conclusions in this Order, by any other party in any other
proceeding.
intent to execute that order (the âResting Orderââ) and, prior to the execution of the Resting
Order, placing a larger order (or multiple orders), which Trader A intended to cancel before
execution, on the opposite side of the same market (the âSpoof Orderâ). Generally, Trader A
would receive a partial or complete fill of the Resting Order and cancel the Spoof Order before it
was filled.

2. HSBCâs Cooperation and Remediation

Before and during the course of the Divisionâs investigation of potential misconduct in
the precious metals market, HSBC, and where appropriate its affiliates: conducted an internal
review, including analyzing the trading activity of certain traders for potential spoofing
misconduct; substantially assisted the Divisionâs investigation by proactively expanding its
internal review; identified Trader Aâs misconduct, and promptly reported it to the Division;
promptly took appropriate personnel measures with regard to Trader A; and provided important
information and analysis to the Division, which helped the Division to efficiently and effectively
carry out its investigation.

HSBC has represented that it also initiated an overhaul of its systems and controls and
implemented a variety of enhancements to detect and deter similar misconduct. HSBC has
further represented that, as part of this process, HSBC revised its policies, updated its training,
and updated its electronic monitoring and surveillance practices to detect and deter potential
spoofing misconduct and other manipulative trading.

Hl.
LEGAL DISCUSSION

A. Spoofing in the Precious Metals Futures Markets, in violations of Section 4c(a)(5)(C)
of the Act

Section 4c(a)(5)(C) of the Act makes it unlawful for â[a]ny person to engage in any
trading, practice, or conduct on or subject to the rules of a registered entity that .. . is, is of the
character of, or is commonly known to the trade as, âspoofingâ (bidding or offering with the
intent to cancel the bid or offer before execution).â 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6c(a)(5)(C) (2012); see also
United States v. Coscia, No. 16-3017, 2017 WL 3381433, at *7 (7th Cir. Aug. 7, 2017) (holding
that because the CEA clearly defines spoofing, it provides adequate notice of prohibited
conduct).

As described above, Trader A entered numerous bids or offers on a registered entity with
the intent to cancel the bids or offers before execution, in violations of Section 4c(a)(5)(C) of the
Act. See, e.g., In re Posen, CFTC No. 17-20, 2017 WL 3216576, at *2 (July 26, 2017) (consent
order) (finding that manual trader âentered into thousands of bids or offers on a registered entity
with the intent to cancel the bids or offers before execution in violations of Section 4c(a)(5)(C) of
the Actâ); CFTC v. Oystacher, 203 F. Supp. 3d 934, 942 (N.D. Ill. 2016) (denying motion for
judgment on the pleadings, holding that allegations of placing âboth bids and offers with the
intent to cancel those bids or offers before executionâ constitutes âtrading behavior [that] falls
within the Spoofing Statuteâs defined prohibitionâ); CFTC v. Nav Sarao Futures Ltd., No. 15-
3398, 2016 WL 8257513, at *10 (N.D. Ill. Nov. 14, 2016) (consent order) (finding that
defendants engaged in spoofing techniques by, among other things, ââplac[ing] tens of thousands
of bids and offers for the E-Mini S&P contract with the intent of cancelling those bids and offers
before execution (i.e., Spoof Orders)ââ); CFTC v. Khara, No. 15-CV-03497, ECF 35 at 6
(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 31, 2016) (consent order) (finding that âDefendants . . . engaged in unlawful
disruptive trading practices or conduct in the gold and silver futures markets . . . that were, were
of the character of, or were commonly known to the trade as âspoofingâ (bidding and offering
with the intent to cancel the bid or offer before execution).ââ).

B. Respondent HSBC Is Liable for the Acts of Its Agent

Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(a)(1)(B) (2012), and Regulation 1.2, 17
C.F.R. Â§ 1.2 (2017), provide that â[t]he act, omission, or failure of any official, agent, or other
person acting for any individual, association, partnership, corporation, or trust within the scope
of his employment or office shall be deemed the act, omission, or failure of such individual,
association, partnership, corporation, or trust.â Pursuant to Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act and
Commission Regulation 1.2, strict liability is imposed on principals for the actions of their
agents. See, e.g., Rosenthal & Co. v. CFTC, 802 F.2d 963, 966 (7th Cir. 1986); Dohmen-
Ramirez & Wellington Advisory, Inc. v. CFTC, 837 F.2d 847, 857-58 (9th Cir. 1988); CFTC v.
Byrnes, 58 F. Supp. 3d 319, 324 (S.D.N.Y. 2014).

Trader A engaged in the conduct described herein within the course and scope of his
employment; therefore, pursuant to Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act and Regulation 1.2, Respondent is
liable for the acts, omissions, and failures of Trader A in violations of the provisions of the Act and
Commission Regulations cited above.

IV.
FINDINGS OF violations

Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that, during the Relevant Period, the
Respondent violated Section 4c(a)(5) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6c(a)(5)(C) (2012).

reasonably promptly review such reports and follow up as necessary to determine
whether spoofing activity has occurred.

attempted manipulation, to be given to all employees trading on behalf of
Respondent or other affiliated entities who submit any orders on futures markets,
and their supervisors.

Cooperation with the Commission: Respondent shall cooperate fully and
expeditiously with the Commission, including the Commissionâs Division of
Enforcement, in this action, and in any current or future Commission
investigation or action related thereto. Respondent shall also cooperate in any
investigation, civil litigation, or administrative matter related to, or arising from,
this action. As part of such cooperation, Respondent agrees to:

 

i. preserve and produce to the Commission in a responsive and prompt
manner, as requested by the Divisionâs staff, all non-privileged
documents, information, and other materials wherever located, including
but not limited to audio files, electronic communications, and trading
records and data, in the possession, custody, or control of Respondent;

ii. comply fully, promptly, completely, and truthfully, subject to any legally
recognized privilege, with any inquiries or requests for information and
documents;

ii. identify and authenticate relevant documents and other evidentiary
materials, execute affidavits or declarations, and provide a corporate
representative to testify completely and truthfully at depositions, trial, and
other judicial proceedings, when requested to do so by the Divisionâs staff;

iv. use its best efforts to produce any current (as of the time of the request)
officer, director, employee, or agent of Respondent, regardless of the
individualâs location, and at such a location that minimizes Commission
travel expenditures, to provide assistance at any trial, proceeding, or
Commission investigation related to the subject matter of this proceeding,
including but not limited to, requests for testimony, depositions, and/or
interviews, and to encourage them to testify completely and truthfully in
any such proceeding, trial, or investigation; and

v. subject to applicable laws and regulations, use its best efforts to assist in
locating and contacting any prior (as of the time of the request) officer,
director, employee, or agent of Respondent.

5. Partial Satisfaction: Respondent understands and agrees that any acceptance by
the Commission of any partial payment of Respondentâs CMP Obligation shall
not be deemed a waiver of its obligation to make further payments pursuant to this
Order, or a waiver of the Commissionâs right to seek to compel payment of any
remaining balance.

 

6. Change of Address/Phone: Until such time as Respondent satisfies in full its
CMP Obligation as set forth in this Order, Respondent shall provide written
notice to the Commission by certified mail of any change to its telephone number
and mailing address within ten (10) calendar days of the change.

 

D. Based on the nature of the violations; the findings made, and the sanctions, conditions,
and undertakings imposed in the Order; and the facts and representations in Respondentâs
Request Letter, the Commission advisesâ that, under the circumstances, disqualification
under Rule 262(a) of Regulation A and Rule 506(d)(1) of Regulation D of the SEC, 17

 

* Rule 506(d)(1)(iii)(B) disqualifies an issuer from relying on the private offering exemptions provided for in Rule
506 if they or certain related parties are âsubject to a final order of . . . [inter alia] the U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission . . . that: . . . [c]onstitutes a final order based on a violations of any law or regulation that
prohibits fraudulent, manipulative, or deceptive conduct.â Rule 506(d)(2)(iii), however, provides that
disqualification âshall not applyâ if the CFTC âadvises in writingâ that disqualification under Rule 506(d)(1)
âshould not arise as a consequence of such order.â See also 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 262(a)(3)(ii), (b)(3) (parallel provisions
under Regulation A); SEC, Exemptions to Facilitate Intrastate and Regional Securities Offerings, 81 Fed. Reg.
83,494, 83,545 (Nov. 21, 2016) (stating that disqualification under Rule 504 arises âabsent a waiver or other
exception provided in Rule 506(d)â).
C.F.R. Â§Â§ 230.262(a), 230.506(d)(1) (2017), should not arise as a consequence of this
Order.

The Commission notes that if the facts are different from those represented, or
Respondent fails to comply with the terms of the Order, the Commission may, in its
discretion, revisit its advice that disqualification should not arise. The Commission
reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to withdraw or otherwise revoke or further
condition its advice under those circumstances.

The provisions of this Order shall be effective as of this date.

By the Commission.

Commodity Futures Trading Commission

* In providing this advice, the Commission considered factors similar to those considered by the SEC when it issues
waivers of disqualification under Regulation A and Regulation D. The SEC grants waivers where an applicant has
shown âgood cause and... if the [SEC] determines that it is not necessary under the circumstances that an
exemption be denied,â 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 230.262(b)(2), 230.506(d)(2)(ii), based on its analysis of how the identified
misconduct bears on the applicantâs fitness to participate in offerings exempted under Regulation A and Regulation
D. See SEC, Div. of Corp. Fin., Waivers of Disqualification Under Regulation A and Rules 505 and 506 of
Regulation D, bttps://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/guidance/disqualification-waivers.shtml; SEC, Div. of Corp.
Fin., Rule 504 of Regulation D: A Small Entity Compliance Guide for Issuers,

https://www.sec. gov/divisions/corpfin/guidance/rule504-issuer-small-entity-compliance.html. The SEC considers
the following primary factors in determining whether to grant a waiver request: (i) the nature of the violations and
whether it involved the offer or sale of securities; (ii) whether the violations required scienter; (iii) who was
responsible for the misconduct; (iv) what was the duration of the misconduct; (v) what remedial steps have been
taken; and (vi) the impact on the party seeking a waiver and third parties if a waiver is denied. Respondentâs
Request Letter addressed these factors in the context of this Order.

The Commission considers these factors in the context of the markets it regulates, and also takes into account
whether it determined that a statutory disqualification under the Act should arise solely based on the misconduct
found herein and leading to disqualification under Regulation A and Regulation D. The Commission is guided by
waivers granted by the SEC in prior cases involving similar facts and circumstances. See, e.g., In re JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A., Securities Act Release No. 9993, 2015 WL 9256636 (Dec. 18, 2015) (SEC order determining that
good cause had been shown that it was not necessary to deny reliance on the exemption under Rule 506 of
Regulation D, where disqualification had been triggered by a CFTC order relating to JPMCBâs failure to adequately
disclose certain conflicts of interest to clients); In re UBS AG, Securities Act Release No. 9787, 2015 WL 2395516
(May 20, 2015) (SEC order determining that good cause had been shown that it was not necessary to deny reliance
on the exemption under Rule 506, where disqualification had been triggered by a criminal guilty plea relating to FX
benchmark manipulation and noting the entry of parallel CFTC orders); Jn re Barclays PLC, Securities Act Release
No. 9786, 2015 WL 2395515 (May 20, 2015) (SEC order determining that good cause had been shown that it was
not necessary to deny reliance on the exemption under Rule 506 where disqualification had been triggered by a
CFTC order relating to FX benchmark and ISDAFIX manipulation); see also, e.g., Piper Jaffray & Co., SEC No-
Action Letter, 2015 WL 4451053 (July 20, 2015) (SEC no-action letter determining that good cause had been shown
that it was not necessary to deny reliance on the exemptions under Regulation A and Rule 506 of Regulation D,
where disqualification had been triggered by an SEC order, and applying the same factors to consideration of waiver
for both exemptions).

<h1>CFTC Charges Andre Flotron with Spoofing and Engaging in a Deceptive and Manipulative Scheme in the Precious Metals Futures Markets</h1>

<p><b>Washington, DC</b>Â â The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) announced the filing of a civil enforcement action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut againstÂ <b>Andre Flotron</b>, of Switzerland, charging him with engaging in a manipulative and deceptive scheme and spoofing in the precious metals futures markets on a registered entity.</p>

<p><b>CFTCâs Director of Enforcement Comments</b></p>

<p>James McDonald, the CFTCâs Director of Enforcement, commented: âSpoofers unlawfully inject false information into the market that is intended to trick law-abiding market participants into trading at distorted prices that improperly benefit the spoofer. As this case shows, the CFTC is committed to pursuing the individuals responsible for spoofing in our markets.â</p>

<p>The CFTC Complaint alleges that from approximately August 2008 through November 2013, while employed as a precious metals trader at Bank A, Flotron engaged in manipulative or deceptive acts and practices by âspoofingâ (bidding or offering with the intent to cancel the bid or offer before execution) on an ongoing basis.Â  Specifically, the Complaint alleges that Flotron placed large orders to buy or sell precious metals futures contracts that he intended to cancel before execution.Â  The Complaint alleges that Flotron placed these âspoof ordersâ on the opposite side of the market from smaller orders that he intended to execute.Â  According to the Complaint, Flotron placed the large spoof orders to send false signals of increased demand or increased supply designed to trick other market participants into executing on his smaller orders, or recklessly disregarded that the spoof orders would send such false signals to market participants.</p>

<p>The CFTC Complaint also alleges that, in or about 2008, Flotron was the primary person assigned to train another trader at Bank A. In the course of this training, Flotron taught the other trader how to spoof.</p>

<p>In its continuing civil litigation, the CFTC seeks, among other relief, civil monetary penalties, disgorgement, and a permanent injunction against future violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC Regulations, as charged.</p>

<p>The CFTC thanks and acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the CME Group.</p>

<p>This case is brought in connection with the CFTC Division of Enforcementâs Spoofing Task Force, and the staff members responsible for this case are Sam Wasserman, David Oakland, Brandon Wozniak, Alben Weinstein, Patryk J. Chudy, Lenel Hickson, Jr., and Manal M. Sultan.</p>

Plaintiff, Civil Action No. 18-158
ECF Case
V.
ANDRE FLOTRON, JURY TRIAL DEMANDED
Defendant,

 

 

COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, CIVIL MONETARY
PENALTIES, AND OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF

Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCFTCâ) alleges as follows:

I. SUMMARY

1. Beginning in at least August 2008 through at least November 2013 (the âRelevant
Periodâ), Defendant Andre Flotron (âFlotronââ) engaged in a manipulative and deceptive scheme
in the precious metals futures markets on a registered entity. As part of this scheme, Flotron
engaged in manipulative or deceptive acts and practices by âspoofingâ (bidding or offering with
the intent to cancel the bid or offer before execution) on an ongoing basis. On numerous
occasions, Flotron placed a visibly small order for COMEX gold or silver futures contracts that
he wanted to get filled (the âGenuine Orderâ) and entered a larger order for the same contract on
the opposite side of the book that he intended to cancel before execution (the âSpoof Orderâ). In
placing these Spoof Orders, Flotron intentionally sent false signals of increased demand or

increased supply designed to trick other market participants into executing against his Genuine

Orders, or Flotron recklessly disregarded that the Spoof Orders would send such false signals to
market participants.

2. By virtue of this conduct, as further alleged herein, from approximately July 2011
through at least November 2013, Flotronâs trading practices described above violated Section
4c(a)(5)(C) of the Commodity Exchange Act (the âActâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6c(a)(5)(C) (2012).

3. By virtue of this conduct, as further alleged herein, from approximately August
2011 through at least November 2013, Flotron engaged in acts and practices that violated Section
6(c)(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 9(1) (2012), and Commission Regulation (âRegulationâââ)
180.1(a)(1) and (3), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 180.1(a)(1), (3) (2017).

4. Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1
(2012), to enjoin Flotronâs violative acts and practices and to compel Flotronâs compliance with
the Act. In addition, Plaintiff seeks civil monetary penalties and such other equitable relief,
including but not limited to disgorgement, as this Court deems necessary and appropriate.

If. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

5. This Court has jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1331 (2012)
(federal question jurisdiction) and 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1345 (2012), which provides that district courts
have original jurisdiction over civil actions commenced by the United States or by any agency
expressly authorized to sue by Act of Congress. Section 6c(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(a)
(2012), authorizes the Commission to seek injunctive relief against any person whenever it shall
appear to the Commission that such person has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in
any act or practice constituting a violations of any provision of the Act or any rule, regulation or

order thereunder.
Case 3:18-cv-00158 Document1 Filed 01/26/18 Page 3 of 21

6. Venue properly lies with this Court, pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
Â§ 13a-1(e) (2012), because Flotron is found in this District or transacted business in this District.
Venue is also proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1391(c)(3).

Hil. PARTIES

7. Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an independent federal
regulatory agency that is charged by Congress with the administration and enforcement of the
Act and Regulations promulgated thereunder.

8. Defendant Andre Flotron was employed by Bank A as a trader from at least
2008 to January 2014. For the duration of this time period, Flotron was employed as a trader and
in a managerial capacity, overseeing other precious metals traders at Bank A, including but not
limited to those based in Bank Aâs Stamford, Connecticut offices. Flotron has never been
registered with the Commission. Flotron is a Swiss national domiciled in Switzerland. He is
currently, however, in the United States and must remain here pending trial pursuant to this
Courtâs order in United States v. Flotron, 17-cr-00220.

IV. FACTS

A. Market Fundamentals

9. A Futures Contract is an agreement to purchase or sell a commodity for delivery
or cash settlement in the future at a specified price. A futures contract traded on an exchange has
standard, non-negotiable contract specifications.

10. An âOrder,â in the context of electronic exchange trading, is a request submitted
to an exchange to buy (that is, âbidââ) or sell (that is, âofferââ?) a certain number of a specified
futures contract. An order is for one or more contracts. Contracts may also be called ââlots,â
among other things. Orders are entered into the exchangeâs Order Book. When one or more

contracts in an order are bought or sold, that is a âfillâ (or a âtradeâ or âexecutionâ). At any time

3
before the order is fully filled, the trader can âcancelâ the order. When an order is canceled, the
contracts that have not yet been bought or sold are pulled from the Order Book.

11. When a âbuyâ or âsellâ order is submitted to an exchangeâs electronic trading
system, the order becomes part of the Order Book. In the Order Book, each trader can view the
aggregate number of contracts that all traders are actively bidding or offering at a given price
level. The best-bid level, or first-bid level, is the highest price at which someone is willing to
buy. The best-offer level, or first-offer level, is the lowest price at which someone is willing to
sell. The bid-ask spread is the difference between those two prices.

12. Traders can view the aggregate resting contracts and orders up to the tenth-bid
and tenth-offer levels. This combined bid and offer information is often referred to as the visible
Order Book and represents the visible market depth. Traders often rely on information in the
Order Book to make trading decisions.

13. Order Book Balance refers to the numeric relationship between the number of
pending visible contracts offered and the number of pending visible contracts bid. Many market
participants rely on the information contained in the Order Book and consider it when making
trading decisions. For instance, if the aggregate size and number of sell orders significantly
outweighs the total aggregate size and number of buy orders, market participants may believe
that the Order Book Balance indicates that supply is exceeding demand and a price drop is
imminent. Accordingly, they may decide to place orders to sell.

14. Commodity Exchange, Inc. (ââCOMEXââ) is a futures exchange located in New
York, New York. COMEX is a designated contract market for trading futures and options under

the Act. COMEX is owned and operated by CME Group, Inc. (âCME Groupâ), which is a
OP eS FO Th ps ae a FO
wiser mo APE by OUT
fads A PERL ae AE Sk.

Delaware corporation with its headquarters in Chicago, Illinois. CME Groupâs COMEX lists for
trading gold futures, silver futures, and other precious metals contracts.

15. COMEX Gold Contract is regularly traded on Globex (CMEâs electronic trading
system) for delivery during the current calendar month, the next two calendar months, any
February, April, August, and October falling within a 23-month period, and any June and
December falling within a 72-month period beginning with the current month. One contract unit
is equal to 100 troy ounces. The COMEX Gold Contract is generally referred to herein as âGold
Futures.â

16. COMEX Silver Contract is regularly traded for delivery during the current
calendar month, the next two calendar months, any January, March, May, and September falling
within a 23-month period, and any July and December falling within a 60-month period
beginning with the current month. One contract unit is equal to 5,000 troy ounces. The COMEX
Silver Contract is generally referred to herein as âSilver Futures.â

17. Tick refers to the minimum price fluctuation for a particular futures contract. The
minimum price fluctuation for Gold Futures is $.10 per troy ounce. The minimum price
fluctuation for Silver Futures is $.005 per troy ounce.

18. Globexâs matching algorithm applies a First-In-First-Out (âFIFOââ) principle to
orders at the same level of the Order Book. For example, if there are multiple orders sitting at
the level of the best bid, and an offer is then placed at that same level, the bids will be filled in
the order that they were placed. Modifications to price or quantity will move the order to the

back of the queue.

B. Flotronâs Manipulative and Deceptive Scheme

19. During the Relevant Period, Flotron engaged in an ongoing practice of spoofing.
Flotron entered comparatively large orders for precious metals futures contracts, which he
intended to cancel before execution (Spoof Orders), opposite smaller orders for precious metals
futures contracts, which he desired to execute (Genuine Orders). Flotron entered the Spoof
Orders with the intent to send false signals to market participants about the balance of the Order
Book and trick market participants into transacting on his Genuine Orders, or, at the very least,
with reckless disregard for the fact that his Spoof Orders would send such false signals to market
participants.

20. For example, from time to time, Flotron would enter a Genuine Order for less
than 10 lots and, usually within 30 seconds thereafter, place a Spoof Order of 20 or more lots on
the other side of the Order Book. More specifically, Flotron often placed the larger, Spoof
Orders in an amount where the digits were the same (e.g., 22 lots, 33 lots, 44 lots, 55 lots, 99
lots, 111 lots). Typically, Flotronâs Spoof Orders were placed at least one tick behind the best
price so as to reduce the likelihood of them being filled.

21. At times, in the event Flotronâs initial Genuine Order was filled, he would then
place a series of additional small Genuine Orders while the Spoof Order was still pending.
These additional Genuine Orders tended to be at the same price as the initial Genuine Order.
Moreover, the additional small Genuine Orders were, at times, placed in rapid succession,
indicating that Flotron sometimes used an automated tool that conditioned the placement of an
additional order on a prior one being filled.

22. Upon placement of a Spoof Order, Flotron intended to cancel it before execution.

The cancellation usually occurred after his Genuine Order or series of Genuine Orders was filled.
23. When his Genuine Order was a buy order, Flotronâs Spoof Order was an offer to
sell. In placing these Spoof Orders to sell, Flotron intended to send market participants a false
signal of greater supply to create the impression that the price would likely decline and trick
market participants into transacting on his Genuine Order to buy, or acted with reckless disregard
that the Spoof Orders would send such false signals to market participants.

24. When Flotronâs Genuine Order was an offer to sell, Flotronâs Spoof Order was a
buy order. In placing these Spoof Orders to buy, Flotron intended to send market participants a
false signal of greater demand to create the impression that the price would likely rise and trick
market participants into transacting on his Genuine Order to sell, or acted with reckless disregard
that the Spoof Orders would send such false signals to market participants.

25. In placing the Spoof Orders, Flotron gave market participants the false impression
that he actually wanted to buy or sell the number of contracts in the orders when, in reality, he
did not.

26. Flotron engaged in the manipulative and deceptive scheme by spoofing to trick
other market participants into executing against his Genuine Ordersâto cause his Genuine
Orders to be filled sooner, at a better price, or in larger quantities than they otherwise would.

27. Flotron knew or recklessly disregarded that the Spoof Orders would create a false
impression of Order Book Balance and result in misinformation, thereby luring market
participants to trade based on Flotronâs spoofing. The risk that the Spoof Orders could mislead
other market participants into believing there was genuine interest in purchasing or selling the
specified number of contracts represented by Flotronâs Spoof Orders was so obvious that Flotron
must have been aware of it. He knew that his Spoof Orders would appear in the Order Book and

that traders often considered Order Book Balance information in making trading decisions.
Case 3:18-cv-00158 Document1 Filed 01/26/18 Page 8 of 21

Thus, Flotron was, at least, reckless with respect to the danger that his Spoof Orders would
mislead other market participants.
C. Flotron Spoofed and Taught a Subordinate How To Spoof

28. In or about July 2008, Trader A began working on Bank Aâs precious metals
trading desk in Stamford, Connecticut. For approximately Trader Aâs first two months on the
desk in Stamford, Flotron was the primary person assigned to train Trader A. Trader A sat next
to Flotron in Bank Aâs Stamford office and observed Flotronâs trading practices.

29. During Trader Aâs training, Flotron gave Trader A instructions on how to spoof
and demonstrated spoofing for Trader Aâs benefit. Specifically, Flotron explained that Trader A
should place an order Trader A wanted filled and that such an order should be broken up, or
âiceberged,â such that only a small piece of it was visible to the market at a time. Flotron further
explained that Trader A should then place a large, fully visible, âspoofâ order on the opposite
side of the market in an effort to trick market participants (including algorithmic traders) into
transacting on his Genuine Order. Trader A learned from Flotron to cancel the âspoofâ order
after the Genuine Order was hit (or lifted), so that the Spoof Order would not get filled.

30. During the period in which he was training Trader A in Stamford, Flotron
spoofed. For example, on August 29, 2008, at 13:10:15.5 36,! Flotron placed a 7-lot Genuine
Order to buy December-delivery Gold Futures at $836.40. The 7-lot Genuine Order remained
pending for approximately ten seconds, at which point Flotron placed a 44-lot Spoof Order to
sell at $836.80 that he intended to cancel before execution. Less than two-tenths of a second
after Flotron placed the 44-lot Spoof Order, the 7-lot Genuine Order was filled in its entirety.

Flotron then placed a series of three additional 7-lot Genuine Orders to buy and then one 5-lot

 

All times referred to herein are Eastern Time.

8
Case 3:18-cv-00158 Documenti1 Filed 01/26/18 Page 9 of 21

Genuine Order to buy that were all filled over the next two seconds at either $836.40 or $836.30.
Approximately two seconds after the 5-lot buy order was filled, Flotron cancelled the 44-lot
Spoof Order to sell in its entirety.

31. While on Bank Aâs precious metals desk in Stamford, and in accordance with the
training he received from Flotron, Trader A spoofed. For example, on October 9, 2008, at
8:42:49.115, Trader A placed a 3-lot order to sell December-delivery Gold Futures at $889.50.
This 3-lot Genuine Order remained pending for over six minutes without getting filled. At
8:49:18.528, Trader A entered a 40-lot Spoof Order to buy December-delivery Gold Futures at
$888.50 that he intended to cancel before execution. At 8:49:49.258, Trader Aâs 3-lot order to
sell was still pending, so he placed another Spoof Order to buyâthis time of 20 lotsâat
$889.00, five ticks higher than his original Spoof Order to buy. Less than three seconds later,
Trader Aâs 3-lot Genuine Order to sell began to be filled. Trader A then placed a series of other
small sell orders at $889.50 that were also filled over the next several seconds. At 8:50:16.626,
Trader A cancelled his 20-lot Spoof Order in its entirety. At 8:52:02.264, after he placed and
was filled on a series of even more small sell orders at $889.50, Trader A also cancelled his 40-
lot Spoof Order in its entirety.

D. Examples of Flotronâs Scheme Continuing Through 2013

32. Flotron continued to engage in a regular practice of spoofing in the manner
described above through 2013, including but not limited to the following occasions. With each
Spoof Order he placed, Flotron intended to, or acted with reckless disregard that it would, send a
false signal of increased supply or a false signal of increased demand to market participants.
Flotron placed each Spoof Order with the intent to, or with reckless disregard that it would, trick

market participants into transacting on his Genuine Order(s) and cause his Genuine Orders to be
filled sooner, at a better price, or in larger quantities that they otherwise would. His pattern, as
evidenced below, of placing Spoof Orders that were always canceled after his Genuine Orders
were filled demonstrates that he always intended to cancel those Spoof Orders prior to execution.

I. September 6, 2011 Spoofing

33. On September 6, 2011, at approximately 5:06:32.3, Flotron placed a 1-lot
Genuine Order to buy December-delivery Gold Futures at $1893.70 and a 1-lot Genuine Order to
buy the same contract at $1893.60. The 1-lot bid at $1893.70 was the best bid at the time of
placement.

34. Approximately two and a half seconds later, at 5:06:35.057, Flotron placed a 33-
lot Spoof Order to sell at $1894.30 that he intended to cancel before execution. His 33-lot order

to sell was three ticks away from the best offer at the time of placement.

35. Both of Flotronâs 1-lot buy orders were filled less than one tenth of a second
thereafter.
36. Over the next six seconds, Flotron (either manually or through an automated

trading tool he controlled) placed a series of fourteen additional 1-lot Genuine Orders to buy that
were filled at either $1893.60 or $1893.70.

37. At 5:06:43.251, Flotron cancelled his 33-lot Spoof Order to sell in its entirety.

2. June 28, 2012 Spoofing

38. On June 28, 2012, at 13:26:33.786, Flotron placed a 1-lot Genuine Order to buy
August-delivery Gold Futures at $1550.10. At the time, $1550.10 was the best bid in the market.
The price, however, moved away from Flotronâs bid over the next eight seconds, trading as high

as $1550.40.

10
39. At 13:26:39.028, Flotron placed another 1-lot Genuine Order to buy August-
delivery Gold Futures at $1550.20.

AO. At 13:26:42.415, with both genuine buy orders still pending, Flotron placed a 55-
lot Spoof Order to sell August-delivery Gold Futures at $1550.50 that he intended to cancel
before execution.

41. Flotronâs 55-lot sell order was two ticks away from the best offer at the time it
was placed.

42. Flotronâs 1-lot buy order at $1550.20 was filled less than one-hundredth of a
second after the placement of the Spoof Order. And his initial 1-lot buy order at $1550.10 was
filled approximately one second later.

43. At 13:26:53.313, approximately three seconds after the last in a series of
additional small genuine buy orders was filled, Flotron cancelled his 55-lot Spoof Order to sell in
its entirety.

3. February 15, 2013 Spoofing

44, On February 15, 2013, at 5:59:28.544, Flotron placed a 1-lot Genuine Order to
buy March-delivery Silver Futures at $30.180. At the time of placement, this Genuine Order was
at the best price level, but not the first in the queue.

45. The Genuine Order sat pending for over four seconds, at which point Flotron
placed a 55-lot Spoof Order to sell March-delivery Silver Futures at $30.190 that he intended to
cancel before execution.

46. At the time of placement, the Spoof Order to sell was one tick away from the best

offer.

11
47. At the time Flotron placed the 55-lot Spoof Order, the total visible sell-side order

volume was 116 lots. His Spoof Order, therefore, increased the visible sell-side volume by

almost 50%.
A8. Less than one-tenth of a second later, Flotronâs Genuine Order was filled.
49. Less than four-tenths of a second after this fill, Flotron (either manually or

through an automated trading tool he controlled) placed a series of four additional 1-lot Genuine
Orders at $30.180 that were filled in quick succession (within 1.5 seconds).

50. Flotron cancelled the 55-lot Spoof Order to sell less than two seconds after the
fourth additional 1-lot Genuine Order was filled.

4. July 1, 2013 Spoofing

51. On July 1, 2013, at 10:11:06.151, Flotron placed at 1-lot Genuine Order to sell
August-delivery Gold Futures at a price of $1238.50. At the time of placement, the order was
two ticks away from the best offer in the Order Book (and there were seven lots better offered).
Over the next seventeen seconds, several lots traded but none at a price higher than $1238.30.

52. At 10:11:23.173, with his 1-lot sell order still pending at $1238.50, Flotron placed
a 111-lot Spoof Order to buy August-delivery Gold Futures at $1237.90 that he intended to
cancel before execution.

53. At the time he placed this 111-lot Spoof Order to buy, it was three ticks below the
best bid.

54. At the time Flotron placed the 111-lot Spoof Order to buy, the visible volume on
the offer side of the Order Book was 127 lots and the visible volume on the buy side of the Order

Book was 119 lots. Therefore, Flotronâs 111-lot Spoof Order converted an Order Book that had

12
been relatively balanced into one in which there was almost twice as much volume bid as there
was offered.

55. Within 1.2 seconds of the placement of the 111-lot Spoof Order to buy, the
market moved two ticks up, filling Flotronâs 1-lot sell order at $1238.50 and a subsequent 1|-lot
sell order at $1238.60.

56. Over the next 29 seconds, the market fluctuated between $1238.80 and $1238.30;
Flotronâs 111-lot Spoof Order to buy was at least four ticks away from the last trade.

57. At 10:11:53.227, the price dropped to $1238.20 and at 10:11:54.543 it dropped to
$1238.10, only two ticks away from Flotronâs 111-lot Spoof Order.

58. Less than one second after the price dropped to $1238.10 and approached his 111-
lot Spoof Order, Flotron cancelled his 111-lot Spoof Order in its entirety.

59. Within one-hundredth of a second of Flotron cancelling his 111-lot Spoof Order
to buy, the market traded at $1237.90âthe price at which his 111-lot Spoof Order had been.

60. In short, Flotron never intended for the 111-lot order to be executed; he cancelled
it as it became likely that itâor some portion of itâwould get filled.

5. October 14, 2013 Spoofing

61. On October 14, 2013, at 8:26:47.706, Flotron entered a 5-lot Genuine Order to
buy December-delivery Gold Futures contracts at a price of $1284.80. At the time of placement
it was the best bid; the best offer was at $1284.90.

62. Less than one second later, at 8:26:48.474, with his 5-lot bid still pending, Flotron
placed a 55-lot Spoof Order to sell December-delivery Gold Futures contracts at a price of

$1285.10 that he intended to cancel before execution.

13
63. At the time he placed this 55-lot Spoof Order to sell, it was two ticks from the
best offer.

64. At the time Flotron placed the 55-lot Spoof Order to sell, there was a total volume
of 89 lots visible on the sell side of the Order Book and none of the five best offer levels
contained a total volume of more than nine lots. The visible volume on the buy side of the Order
Book was 85 lots and none of the five best bid levels contained a total volume of more than nine
lots. Therefore, Flotronâs 55-lot order turned an Order Book that had been relatively balanced
into one in which there was over 60% more volume on the visible sell side of the book than on
the visible buy side. Moreover, the size of Flotronâs offer was more than three times the total
volume at any other visible price level.

65. At 8:26:49.466, less than one second after he placed the 55-lot Spoof Order at
$1285.10, Flotronâs 5-lot buy order was filled at $1284.80.

66. Following this fill, Flotron immediatelyâwithin a few tenths of a secondâplaced
(either manually or through an automated trading tool he controlled) a series of three additional
5-lot Genuine Orders to buy and one additional 1-lot Genuine Order to buy that were filled at
$1284.70 and $1284.80 in quick succession (within the next second).

67. When the market started to move back up toward Flotronâs 55-lot Spoof Order to
sell, he cancelled it. Specifically, at 8:26:52.720, the best bid went from $1284.60 (where it had
been for about 1.5 seconds) to 1284.90, only two ticks from Flotronâs 55-lot offer. Flotron
cancelled the 55-lot Spoof Order to sell in its entirety less than four-tenths of a second later.

68. Flotron cancelled the 55-lot Spoof Order as it became more likely that itâor

some portion of itâwould get filled.

14
6. October 17, 2013 Spoofing

69. On October 17, 2013, Flotron placed three disproportionately large Spoof Orders
in a span of two and a half minutes, each of which he intended to cancel before execution.

70. At 11:13:35.407, Flotron placed a 55-lot Spoof Order to sell December-delivery
Gold Futures at $1319.40 that he intended to cancel before execution. At the time it was placed,
the best offer stood one tick away, at $1319.30. The best bid was $1319.10. By volume, the 55-
lot sell order was equal to nearly 60% of the entire visible buy-side order volume. It was also
more than twice as large as the total volume at any other level in the visible Order Book.

71. Approximately one-tenth of a second after placing the 55-lot Spoof Order to sell,
Flotron placed a 1-lot Genuine Order to buy December-delivery Gold Futures at $1319.20, one
tick higher than the previous best bid. The genuine buy order was filled immediately. About 10
seconds later, after getting filled on six more successive 1-lot bids at $1319.20, Flotron cancelled
the 55-lot Spoof Order to sell in its entirety.

72. At 11:13:55.778, Flotron placed another 1-lot Genuine Order to buy at $1319.20.
At the time of placement, it was the best bid in the market. The best offer at the time was
$1319.30.

73. Despite being the best bid, the 1-lot order sat in the Order Book unfilled for over
4 seconds, at which point Flotron placed a 77-lot Spoof Order to sell at $1319.50 that he
intended to cancel before execution.

74. Just prior to placement of the 77-lot order, the total visible sell-side order volume
was 119 lots and the total visible buy-side order volume was 93 lots. The 77-lot Spoof Order,

therefore, increased the total visible sell-side volume by over 60%.

15
75. One millisecond after the placement of the 77-lot order, Flotronâs 1-lot Genuine
Order to buy was filled at $1319.20.

76. Flotron (either manually or through an automated trading tool he controlled)
subsequently placed six successive 1-lot Genuine Orders to buy at $1319.20, five of which were
filled. The sixth sat at the top of the Order Book for six seconds, at which point Flotron
modified the price of his 77-lot Spoof Order from $1319.50 to $1319.40.

77. Approximately 2.4 seconds after this downward modification, the sixth 1-lot buy
order was filled.

78. At 11:14:26.516, the market traded up to $1319.30, just one tick away from the
77-\ot order that Flotron intended to cancel before execution.

79. Flotron cancelled the 77-lot order in its entirety at 11:14:31.086.

80. At 11:15:33.964, Flotron placed a 1-lot Genuine Order to buy at $1319.10. At the
time this order was placed, it was one tick away from the best bid. The best offer was $1319.30.

81. At 11:15:37.060, Flotron placed a 99-lot Spoof Order to sell at $1319.60 that he
intended to cancel before execution. At the time it was placed, the 99-lot order was four ticks
away from the best offer. At the time, the entire volume on the visible buy side of the Order
Book was only 107 lots, the entire volume on the sell side was only 84 lots, and no single price
level in the entire visible Order Book contained an order volume of greater than 17 lots.
Flotronâs 99-lot Spoof Order more than doubled the volume on the sell side of the Order Book.

82. No trades occurred in the market for the next four seconds.

83. At 11:15:41.248, Flotron modified his 99-lot sell order down one tick, to
$1319.50. Less than one second later, Flotronâs 1-lot Genuine Order to buy at $1319.10 was

filled. Flotron (either manually or through an automated tool he controlled) placed four

16
additional 1-lot Genuine Orders at $1319.10 in succession. Three were filled immediately. The
fourth sat pending for four seconds, at which point Flotron modified his 99-lot order down one
tick again to $1319.40. Less than two seconds later, the fourth 1-lot buy order was filled at
$1319.10.

84. Again, Flotron placed four additional 1-lot Genuine Orders to buy at $1319.10,
three of which were filled over approximately the next four seconds. After the fourth 1-lot buy
order had been pending for about three seconds, the volume on the buy side of the Order Book
significantly increased. Specifically, 60 lots were added to the buy-side volume in the course of
a second. The market price immediately went up to $1319.20, only two ticks away from
Flotronâs 99-lot Spoof Order that he did not want to be filled.

85. Approximately one second after the price went up Flotron cancelled the 99-lot
Spoof Order in its entirety.

<h1>CFTC Charges Trader Krishna Mohan with Spoofing and Engaging in a Manipulative and Deceptive Scheme</h1>

<h3>CFTC Seeks Permanent Injunction, Civil Monetary Penalties, Disgorgement, and Trading and Registration Bans</h3>

<p><b>Washington, DC</b>âThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced the filing of a federal court enforcement action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas againstÂ <b>KrishnaÂ Mohan</b>Â of New York City, New York, charging him with spoofing (bidding or offering with the intent to cancel before execution) and engaging in a manipulative and deceptive scheme in the E-mini Dow ($5) futures contract market on the Chicago Board of Trade and the E-mini NASDAQ 100 futures contract market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.</p>

<p><b>CFTCâs Director of Enforcement Comments</b></p>

<p>James McDonald, the CFTCâs Director of Enforcement, stated: âAs alleged here, over just a multi-week period, the Defendant placed tens of thousands of spoof orders in some of our most heavily traded markets. The Defendant placed these fake orders to trick market participants into trading with him at a better price than he otherwise could have obtained. As this case shows, the CFTC is dedicated to identifying those responsible for spoofing in our markets and holding them accountable.â</p>

<p>The CFTC Complaint alleges that, as part of his manipulative and deceptive scheme, from at least November 25, 2013 to DecemberÂ 17,Â 2013, Mohan repeatedly engaged in manipulative or deceptive acts or practices by spoofing in accounts owned by his former employer, a proprietary trading firm. The Complaint further alleges that Mohan executed his scheme by placing at least one iceberg order (whose order quantity is only partially visible in the order book) on one side of the market that he intended to execute and separately placing one or more fully visible orders on the opposite side of the market that he intended to cancel before execution (spoof orders). In placing his spoof orders, Mohan intentionally or recklessly sent false signals of increased supply or demand designed to trick market participants into executing against the orders he wanted filled.</p>

<p>Additionally, according to the Complaint, Mohanâs Google Drive folder contained documents describing certain spoofing strategies. For example, one such document references a âSmart Stuffing book (order cancel replace),â which would:</p>

<p>âallow [the] trader to control which side they want to show [the] bluffâ and explained that â[a]ll those [bluff] orders are not mean[t] to be traded.â</p>

<ul></ul><p>As alleged in the Complaint, Mohan carried out his scheme through a pattern of conduct that was designed to benefit financially from market participantsâ reactions to his spoof orders, which he intended to cancel. Mohan engaged in the pattern approximately 1,500 times, which included more than 36,000 discrete instances of spoofing.</p>

<p>In its continuing litigation, the CFTC seeks civil monetary penalties, permanent registration and trading bans, disgorgement, and a permanent injunction against further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations, as charged.</p>

<p>The CFTCâs Enforcement Division acknowledges and thanks the staff of the Market Regulation Department of the CME Group, the U.S. Department of Justice, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation for their assistance.</p>

<p>This case is brought in connection with the CFTC Division of Enforcementâs Spoofing Task Force, and the staff members responsible for this case are Peter Riggs, Rebecca Jelinek, Rachel Hayes, Allison Sizemore, Stephen Turley, Joyce Brandt, Christopher Reed, and Charles Marvine.</p>

COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,
CIVIL MONETARY PENALTIES, AND OTHER RELIEF

Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCFTCâ) alleges as follows:
I. SUMMARY

1. From at least November 25, 2013 to December 17, 2013 (the âRelevant Periodâ),
defendant Krishna Mohan (âMohanâ) engaged in a manipulative and deceptive scheme while
placing orders for and trading futures contracts on at least two registered entities. In furtherance
of the scheme, Mohan repeatedly engaged in manipulative or deceptive acts and practices by
âspoofingâ (bidding or offering with the intent to cancel the bid or offer before execution). On
tens of thousands of occasions during the Relevant Period, Mohan placed orders to buy or sell
futures contracts that he intended to cancel before execution at the time the orders were placed.
In doing so, Mohan intentionally or recklessly sent false signals of increased supply or demand
designed to trick market participants into executing against the orders he wanted filled.

2. By virtue of this conduct, as further alleged herein, Mohan engaged in acts and

practices that violated Sections 4c(a)(5)(C) and 6(c)(1) of the Commodity Exchange Act (âActâ),

7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6c(a)(5)(C), 91) (2012), and CFTC Regulation (âRegulationâ) 180.1(a)(1) and (3),
17 C.F.R. Â§ 180.1(a)(1), (3) (2017).

3. The CFTC brings this action pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1
(2012), to enjoin Mohanâs violative acts and practices and to compel Mohanâs compliance with
the Act and Regulation. In addition, the CFTC seeks civil monetary penalties and such other
relief, including but not limited to disgorgement and trading and registration prohibitions, as this
Court deems necessary or appropriate.

I. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4, This Court has jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1331 (2012)
(federal question jurisdiction) and 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1345 (2012), which provides that district courts
have original jurisdiction over civil actions commenced by the United States or by any agency
expressly authorized to sue by Act of Congress. Section 6c(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-I(a)
(2012), authorizes the CFTC to seek injunctive relief in any proper district court of the United
States against any person whenever it shall appear to the CFTC that such person has engaged, is
engaging, or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a violations of any provision of
the Act or any rule, regulation, or order thereunder.

5. Venue properly lies with this Court pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act, because
Mohan transacted business in the Southern District of Texas, and acts and practices in violations
of the Act and Regulation occurred in this District.

Ht. PARTIES
6. Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading Commission is the independent federal

regulatory agency charged by Congress with the administration and enforcement of the Act and
Case 4:18-cv-00260 Document1 Filed in TXSD on 01/28/18 Page 3 of 25

Regulations promulgated thereunder. The CFTC is headquartered at 1155 21st Street, NW,
Washington, DC 20581.

7. Defendant Krishna Mohan is an individual with a last known address in New
York City, New York. From approximately August 2010 to March 26, 2014, Mohan was
employed by a proprietary trading firm (the âTrading Firmâ) as a quantitative trader. Mohan has
never been registered with the CFTC.

IV. OTHER RELEVANT PARTIES

8. The Chicago Board of Trade (âCBOTââ) is a commodity exchange located at
141 W. Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois 60604. CBOT is registered with the CFTC as a
designated contract market.

9. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (âCMEâ) is a commodity exchange located
at 20 S. Wacker Street, Chicago, Illinois 60606. CME is registered with the CFTC as a
designated contract market and a swap execution facility.

10. CME Group Ine. (âCME Groupâ) is a Delaware corporation with its principal
place of business in Chicago, Illinois. CME Group is the holding company that owns and
operates the CBOT and CME.

Vv. FACTS
A. Futures Trading Background

11. A futures contract is an agreement to purchase or sell a financial instrument or
physical commodity for delivery or cash settlement in the future at a specified price. A futures
contract traded on an exchange has standard, non-negotiable contract specifications.

12. The E-mini Dow ($5) futures contract (âE-mini Dow contractâ) is traded on

CBOT. There are four E-mini Dow contract months: March, June, September, and December.

ORS Se LG Fa OG LS LEE PRET ER Preihbeea GPP ob ASSES OPP Ub A ao rv eklite Sb Lab lo
pet

The E-mini Dow contract is cash settled so no delivery of the stocks that make up the underlying
index takes place.

13. The value of the E-mini Dow contract is the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index
multiplied by five dollars. The price is quoted in index points, and the minimum price change,
commonly called a âtick,â that is allowed during a trading session is one index point. For
example, if a trader wished to place an order above the last-traded E-mini Dow contract price of
24802 points, that trader would have to place the order at 24803 points or higher.

14. The E-mini NASDAQ 100 futures contract (âE-mini NASDAQ contractâ) is
traded on CME. There are four E-mini NASDAQ contract months: March, June, September,
and December. The E-mini NASDAQ contract is cash settled so no delivery of the stocks that
make up the underlying index takes place.

15. The value of the E-mini NASDAQ contract is the NASDAQ 100 Index multiplied
by twenty dollars. The price is quoted in index points and the minimum price change, or tick,
allowed during a trading session is one-quarter of an index point (.25). For example, if a trader
wished to place an order above the last-traded E-mini NASDAQ contract price of 6292.25
points, that trader would have to place the order at 6292.50 points or higher.

16. | Both the E-mini Dow contract and the E-mini NASDAQ contract trade nearly 24
hours per day from 5:00 PM Central Time on Sunday night to 4:00 PM Central Time on Friday
afternoon, except for a 15-minute window each day when trading halts from 3:15 PM to 3:30 PM
Central Time. The trading day for the E-mini Dow contract and the E-mini NASDAQ contract
generally consists of two trading sessions: the daytime session and the overnight session. The
daytime session runs from 8:30 AM to 3:15 PM Central Time and the overnight session begins

after the 15-minute trading halt and runs from 3:30 PM to 8:29:59 AM Central Time the next

day. The daytime session corresponds with, but does not perfectly overlap, the trading day for
the stocks that make up the underlying indices, which runs from 8:30 AM to 3:00 PM Central
Time on the NYSE and NASDAQ exchanges.

17. Anâorder,â in the context of electronic exchange trading, is a request submitted
to an exchange to buy (âbidâ) or sell (âofferâ or âaskâ) a certain number of a specified futures
contract. An order is for one or more contracts. Contracts may also be called âlots,â among
other things. Orders are entered into the exchangeâs order book. Contracts available for
execution in the order book are sometimes referred to as âworking lots.â. When there exists both
a willing buyer and seller for a contract at a given price, a transaction occurs and is referred to as
a âfillâ (or a âtradeâ or âexecutionâ). At any time before the order is fully filled, the trader can
âcancelâ the order. When an order is canceled, the contracts that have not yet been bought or
sold are pulled from the order book.

18. Each trader can view the aggregate number of contracts and number of orders that
all traders are actively bidding or offering at a given price level. Only the total numbers of
orders and contracts at various price levels are visible, not the number of traders or identities of
the traders who placed the orders. The best-bid level, or first-bid level, is the highest price at
which someone is willing to buy. The best-ask level, or first-ask level, is the lowest price at
which someone is willing to sell. The bid-ask spread is the difference between these two prices.

19. Traders can view the aggregate resting contracts and orders up to the tenth-bid
and tenth-ask levels. This combined bid and ask information is often referred to as the visible
order book and represents the visible market depth. Traders often consider information in the

order book when making trading decisions.

20. An âiceberg order,â also known as a hidden quantity order, is an order type
offered by certain designated contract markets on electronic trading platforms whose order
quantity (1.e., number of contracts) is only partially visible in the order book to other market
participants. For example, if a trader places an iceberg order to buy forty contracts, he or she
may choose to display only one contract (or any other quantity up to the total quantity of the
iceberg order may be selected by the trader) in the order book, thereby hiding the remaining
thirty-nine contracts from view in the order book.

21. An âaggressive orderâ is an order that crosses the bid-ask spread. On the buy side
of the market, an aggressive buy order is placed at the best-ask price or higher so, put simply, it
is an offer to buy at a price that another trader is currently willing to sell. On the sell side of the
market, an aggressive sell order is placed at the best-bid price or lower so, put simply, it 1s an
offer to sell at a price that another trader is currently willing to buy. Accordingly, aggressive
orders are guaranteed to execute, at least partially, immediately after being placed.

22. A âpassive order,â on the other hand, does not give up the spread in price. On the
buy side of the market, a passive buy order is placed at the best-bid price or lower; so, put
simply, it is an offer to buy at a price that is lower than the price that other traders are currently
willing to sell. On the sell side of the market, a passive sell order is placed at the best-ask price
or higher; so, put simply, it is an offer to sell at a price that is higher than the price that other
traders are currently willing to buy. Passive orders rest for at least some amount of time after
being placed and are not guaranteed to execute.

23. The E-mini Dow contract and E-mini NASDAQ contract are traded electronically
on the CME Globex trading system (âGlobexâ). Globex employs a matching algorithm to match

bids and offers for execution. The matching algorithm for the E-mini Dow contract and E-mini
Case 4:18-cv-00260 Document1 Filed in TXSD on 01/28/18 Page 7 of 25

NASDAQ contract is known as âFIFO,â which denotes first-in, first-out. Under the FIFO
method, orders on the same side of the market (1.e., the buy side or the sell side) and at the same
price are filled based on time priority. For example, if two buy orders are placed passively at the
same bid price of 6292.50, and then an aggressive offer to sell one contract at 6292.50 enters to
market, the buy order that was placed first will have one contract fill against the sell order. Thus,
as a general rule, the order that was placed first trades first, irrespective of the orderâs size. An
exception to this rule applies to iceberg ordersâwith iceberg orders, once the visible quantity is
completely filled, the replenishment quantity goes to the back of the time priority queue.

B. Mohanâs Manipulative and Deceptive Scheme

24. | Mohan began working at the Trading Firm as a quantitative trader in
approximately August 2010. In this role, he traded futures contracts on behalf of the Trading
Firm on U.S. exchanges during the Relevant Period, including with one or more counterparties
residing in the Southern District of Texas.

25. Prior to 2013, Mohan provided technical trading support to a team of traders at
the Trading Firm and worked on the development of algorithmic trading programs and semi-
automatic trading tools. In mid-2013, Mohan began learning to trade futures contracts manually.
By early November 2013, Mohan was fully engaged in manually trading futures contracts on
behalf of the Trading Firm. Mohan connected to Globex through the Trading Firmâs trade
servers, which implemented the Trading Firmâs trading control infrastructure called âGeneric
Trading Infrastructure.â During the Relevant Period, at least three Globex Operator IDs (Tag
50s IDs) were registered to Mohan and used by him to place trades at CBOT and CME. In

addition, during the Relevant Period, Mohan used the login ID âkmohanâ to first access the

to Globex.

26. SuperGUI provided the Trading Firmâs manual traders various tools designed to
significantly decrease the amount of time (and computer mouse clicks) required to execute
trading strategies. These tools included, among other things, the ability to: modify personal
default settings (to, for example, set automatic display quantities for iceberg orders); pre-set left
and right computer mouse buttons to defined contract order sizes; input orders by clicking price
levels on a trading ladder screen; utilize features such as an order splitter, which placed multiple
randomly-sized orders at once; or automate repetitive tasks via pre-programmed hotkeys.

27. During the Relevant Period, Mohan engaged in a manipulative and deceptive
scheme, in which he repeatedly spoofed the E-mini Dow contract and the E-mini NASDAQ
contract markets while placing orders for, and trading futures contracts through, accounts owned
by the Trading Firm (the âSchemeâ). As part of this Scheme, Mohan repeatedly utilized
December 2013 and March 2014 E-mini NASDAQ contracts and December 2013 and March
2014 E-mini Dow contracts.

28. Mohanâs Scheme consisted of the following observed pattern: (1) on one side of
the market, placement of at least one passive iceberg order, showing a small visible quantity to
the market, (âGenuine Order(s)ââ); (2) on the opposite side of the Genuine Order, placement of
one or more fully-visible passive order(s)âoften several randomly-sized orders placed using the
order splitter toolâwith the intent to cancel before execution (âSpoof Order(s)â); (3) the
Genuine Order(s) and the Spoof Order(s) are available for execution at the same time; (4) at the
time he placed one or more of the Spoof Orders, Mohanâs total number of visible working lots

placed on the Spoof Order side of the market is at least nine times greater than Mohanâs total

npr

number of visible working lots on the Genuine Order side of the market; and (5) at the placement
of at least one of the Spoof Order(s), Mohanâs number of working lots placed on the opposite
side of the Genuine Order increases by at least forty contracts compared to the number of
working lots present on the opposite side of the Genuine Order at the placement of the Genuine
Order.

29. Instances of this pattern that last no longer than sixty seconds (as measured from
placement of the first Genuine Order to the cancellation or complete execution of the last
Genuine Order) are classified as âEvents.â The pattern is often repeated sequentially on one side
of the market (e.g., with a Genuine Order(s) to buy at or below the current bid) and then on the
other side (e.g., with a Genuine Order(s) to sell at or above the current ask), and the Genuine
Orders may overlap in time. Instances where the Genuine Orders on opposite sides overlap in
time are grouped together as a single âEvent.â Collectively, âGenuine Order(s)â and âSpoof
Order(s)â are referred to as âEvent Orders.â

30. Mohanâs Scheme was designed to benefit financially from market participantsâ
reactions to his Spoof Orders. The following is a simplified explanation of how his Scheme was
intended to work, using a hypothetical example of a Spoof Order on the buy side. A large Spoof
Order to buy would result in an increase in demand in the order book (e.g., create or add to an
order book imbalance in which orders to buy outweigh orders to sell). This increase would be
visible to other market participants and may lead them to conclude that the price is likely to rise.
This conclusion, in turn, would impact market participantsâ decisions, including prompting some
to attempt to purchase contracts before the predicted rise in price happens. In such a case, these
participants would place aggressive orders to buy (1.e., at a higher price than the currently resting

bids in the market), making execution of orders resting on the opposite side of the Spoof Order
id

more likely. Finally, these bids would enable orders on the opposite side of the Spoof Orderâ
such as Mohanâs Genuine Ordersâto fill sooner, at a better price, or in larger quantities than
they otherwise would.

31. During the Relevant Period, as part of the ongoing Scheme, Mohan engaged in
approximately 1,500 Events. As part of those Events, Mohan entered about 2,400 Genuine
Orders and 36,300 Spoof Orders, with most of the Spoof Orders, according to the pattern alleged
herein, quickly being cancelled.

32. Mohan intended to cancel the Spoof Orders before execution, and often did so
after his Genuine Orders were filled. The predictable sequence inherent in Mohanâs spoofing
pattern demonstrates that Mohan was not reacting to market changes when he canceled the Spoof
Orders; rather, he was carrying out a predetermined strategy that was not dependent on market
conditions.

33. By engaging in the Scheme as described herein, Mohan entered Spoof Orders
intending either to intentionally send a false signal to the market that he actually wanted to buy
or sell the number of contracts specified in the Spoof Orders, or while recklessly disregarding the
fact that entering his Spoof Orders would send such a false signalâa signal that injected false
information about supply and demand into the market that could affect market activity. Mohan
engaged in this Scheme to trick other market participants into executing against his Genuine
Orders on the opposite side of the marketâto fill sooner, at a better price, or in larger quantities
than they otherwise would. Mohan knew or recklessly disregarded that the Spoof Orders would
create the false appearance of market depth and result in misinformation, thereby luring market
participants to trade based on Mohanâs spoofing. The risk that the Spoof Orders could mislead

other market participants into believing there was genuine interest in purchasing or selling the
id

specified number of contracts represented by Mohanâs Spoof Orders was so obvious that Mohan
must have been aware of it. He knew that his Spoof Orders would appear in the order book and
that traders often consider order-book information in making trading decisions; thus, Mohan was,
at least, reckless with respect to the danger that his Spoof Orders would mislead other market
participants.

34. | Mohan frequently canceled his Spoof Orders, only to quickly replace them with
Genuine Orders on the same side of the market as the cancelled Spoof Orders. Mohan placed
more than 450 Genuine Orders within one second or less of the cancelation of a Spoof Order(s)
and on the same side of the market as the canceled Spoof Order(s). Moreover, approximately
80% of these Genuine Orders were placed at the exact same price as the Spoof Order that was
cancelled just one second or less before, which further demonstrates Mohanâs intent to trade only
Genuine Orders.

35. In some instances, after using his Scheme to establish a position, Mohan then
used his Scheme on the other side of the market to offset the position he just established. For
example, Mohan would cancel his Spoof Orders (that were fully visible), only to quickly replace
them with Genuine Orders (placed as icebergs) followed by Spoof Orders (that were fully
visible) opposite the newly-placed Genuine Order (and thus opposite the Spoof Orders that he
had just canceled).

36. | Although Mohanâs Spoof Orders were visible to the rest of the market, his
identity as the originator of those orders was not. Only the total number of orders and contracts
at various price levels are visible, not the number of traders or identities of the traders who

placed the orders. Accordingly, Mohan knew that other market participants could not see that
id

the same trader had placed both the Spoof Orders and the Genuine Orders, which might have
tipped off market participants that his Spoof Orders were not bona fide.

37. Mohan concealed the size of his Genuine Orders from the rest of the market by
placing them as iceberg orders. This allowed Mohan to reveal only a small portion of his true
interest to the marketâtypically only one contractâwhile at the same time showing significant
interest on the spoof side of the market. Mohan utilized the iceberg order feature with his
Genuine Orders in order to conceal the increased supply or demand associated with his Genuine
Orders from the market. Mohan did this because the Schemeâs success depended on other
traders believing there was increased supply or demand on the spoof side of the market, not the
genuine side.

38. To further disguise his activity to the market, Mohan routinely made use of an
order splitter tool in SuperGUI to place multiple Spoof Orders at once. Mohan used the order
splitter to place approximately 99.3% of the Spoof Orders he placed in the E-mini Dow contract
market and approximately 99.8% of the Spoof Orders he placed in the E-mini NASDAQ contract
market. Mohan utilized the order splitter in order to engineer the appearance that his order
placement activity was actually originating from multiple sources and in randomized amounts
(signaling increased supply or demand from multiple sources), when in fact all of the additional
increase in supply or demand associated with the Spoof Orders placed via the order splitter
originated with Mohan.

39. Trading overnight was a key component of Mohanâs Scheme and indicative of his
wrongful intent. Mohan carried out his Scheme nearly 95% of the time during overnight
sessions, when trading volume and volatility were substantially decreased. As a result, Mohan

was able to use smaller spoofing orders (with concomitant lower financial risk) to provoke the
id

market reactions he desired. Moreover, because of the reduced volume and volatility in the
overnight sessions, Mohanâs Spoof Orders were more likely to have their desired impactâto
make an execution of the Genuine Order more likely.

AO. Mohanâs efforts to avoid execution of his Spoof Orders were successful. This is
reflected in the vastly diverging fill ratios corresponding with Mohanâs Genuine Orders and
Spoof Orders. Mohan placed approximately 2,400 Genuine Orders during the Relevant Period.
Of those, about 39% of the contracts associated with the Genuine Orders were filled. By
contrast, less than 1% of the contracts associated with the approximately 36,300 Spoof Orders
were filled.

Al. The stark contrast in fill ratios of his Spoof Orders and Genuine Orders is even
more indicative of his illegal intent when put in context of the differing order types he used to
place Spoof and Genuine Orders. As a baseline, whether an order (such as Mohanâs Spoof
Orders) is filled is not dependent on its size; rather, orders at the same price level execute
according to time priority under the FIFO matching algorithm. Iceberg orders (such as Mohanâs
Genuine Orders), on the other hand, execute incrementally by their visible quantity under the
FIFO matching algorithm; meaning, after the visible quantity is executed, a new portion of the
iceberg becomes visible to the market and that visible amount goes to the end of the queue.
Consequently, the Genuine Orders, placed as icebergs, were less likely to fully execute (as
compared to a non-iceberg order placed at the same time) given their treatment under the FIFO
matching algorithm, which sent newly visible portions of the iceberg to the back of the queue
following an execution on a previously visible portion. The Spoof Orders, on the other hand,

were not subject to such a limitation under the matching algorithm. Yet, despite this additional
limitation, the fill ratios show that the Genuine Orders executed frequently, whereas the Spoof
Orders did not.

A2. During the Relevant Period, Mohan tended to cancel his Spoof Orders quickly
after getting filled on a Genuine Order. Mohan canceled approximately 60% of Spoof Orders
placed at the first level of the order book within one second or less of the last fill of the Genuine
Order. He cancelled approximately 84% of Spoof Orders placed at the first level of the order
book within two seconds or less of the last fill of his Genuine Order. Indeed, the closer Mohanâs
Spoof Orders were to the top of the order book (and thus the more likely to be at risk of being
filled), the quicker he cancelled those Spoof Orders following the last fill on the Genuine Order.

43. | Mohan placed his Spoof Orders in a manner to avoid being filled by placing them
behind existing orders, typically at the first or second level of the order book, and by limiting
their duration. During the Relevant Period, the median duration of Mohanâs Spoof Orders in E-
mini Dow contracts was 1.7 seconds, compared with 7.5 seconds for his Genuine Orders and 8.3
seconds for his non-Event Orders. Similarly, the median duration of Mohanâs Spoof Orders in
E-mini NASDAQ contracts was 1.9 seconds, compared with 7.7 seconds for his Genuine Orders
and 4.6 seconds for his non-Event Orders. This disparity in duration between Mohanâs Spoof
Orders and non-spoof orders further indicates his intent to cancel the Spoof Orders before
execution.

44. Mohanâs Spoof Orders comprised a substantial portion of the total working lots in
the E-mini Dow and E-mini NASDAQ market order books during the Relevant Period. For
example, half of Mohanâs Spoof Orders at the best-bid/offer level in the E-mini Dow market
comprised at least 87% of the contracts available at that level and half of Mohanâs Spoof Orders

at the best-bid/offer level in the E-mini NASDAQ markets comprised at least 85% of the
id

contracts available at that level. Despite representing such a significant portion of the E-mini
Dow and E-mini NASDAQ market order books, Mohanâs Spoof Orders rarely executedâfurther
demonstrating that Mohan did not intend for his Spoof Orders to trade.

45. Mohanâs Scheme frequently worked as planned; that is, his Spoof Orders tricked
other market participants into executing against his Genuine Orders. However, there were times
that Mohanâs Genuine Orders continued to sit, unfilled, even after he placed and canceled his
Spoof Orders; thus, not all of the Events resulted in executions of Mohanâs Genuine Orders. See
infra Section C., iv., 455. Still, the fill ratio associated with Mohanâs Genuine Orders was
approximately thirty-nine times higher than that associated with his Spoof Orders, again
demonstrating the differing intent behind his Spoof Orders and Genuine Orders.

46. | Mohanâs Google Drive folder contained documents describing certain spoofing
strategies. For example, one such document references a âSmart Stuffing book.(order cancel
replace),â which would:

allow trader to control which side they want to show bluff. trader decide each
level how many contracts should be put in. and contracts should be break into
multiple smaller contracts in random size which overall average order size match
with the entire books average size. we can also add 30,40,50 contracts into the
book to mimic market makers. never throw easily detected size like 100/200/250
or 60s like 9ner.

Only put bluffing orders in when book exceed 400 contract. and flipped for more than
500 ms.

every 10 second add 1 lot in the existing order and minus | lot to make sure every order
of ours will be at the back of the queue. make a butt called (refresh bluffing)

All those orders are not mean to be traded. if for any reason some one flush big size and
bluff order get filled, order will be sent out immediately to the price it get filled try to
scratch out.

C. Examples of Mohanâs Scheme

47. | Mohanâs Scheme is illustrated in the four Events set forth below. Detailed trade

data associated with these Events is provided in Exhibits A-D to this Complaint.
i. November 27, 2013âDecember 2013 E-Mini Dow Contract

A8. Mohanâs trading in the morning of November 27, 2013, constitutes an Event
pursuant to his Scheme. See Ex. A (displaying detailed trade data). At 8:05:39.461 AM Central
Time (denoted in hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds), Mohan placed an iceberg order to
buy forty E-mini Dow contracts (displaying only one contract to the market) at the second-bid
level (first Genuine Order). At 8:05:40.703 AM, Mohan placed multiple orders, via an order
splitter, to collectively sell forty E-mini Dow contracts at the second-ask level (first group of
Spoof Orders). The first group of Spoof Orders caused the total number of contracts then resting
at the second-ask level to more than quadruple. Only 630 milliseconds after entering his first
group of Spoof Orders, at 8:05:41.333 AM, Mohanâs first Genuine Order began to trade. Within
two milliseconds, or by 8:05:41.335 AM, all forty contracts of the first Genuine Order were
filled. Having completely filled the first Genuine Order, Mohan then proceeded to cancel the
first group of Spoof Orders at 8:05:42.684 AM, just over one second after the first Genuine
Order was fully filled and less than two seconds after he placed his first group of Spoof Orders.

A9. Less than a second later, Mohan immediately repeated his spoofing pattern on the
other side of the market. At 8:05:43.565 AM, Mohan placed an iceberg order to sell forty E-mini
Dow contracts (again displaying only one contract to the market) at the best-ask level (second
Genuine Order). Approximately one and one-half seconds later, at 8:05:45.024 AM, Mohan
placed multiple orders, via an order splitter, to collectively buy forty E-mini Dow contracts at the

second-bid level (second group of Spoof Orders). The second group of Spoof Orders nearly
tripled the number of contracts then resting at that level of the order book. At 8:05:45.117 AM,
only ninety-three milliseconds after he placed the second group of Spoof Orders, Mohanâs
second Genuine Order began to trade, with fourteen of the forty contracts filling by 8:05:46.239
AM. At 8:05:46.239 AM, Mohan placed another group of orders, via an order splitter, to
collectively buy forty E-mini Dow contracts at the best-bid level (third group of Spoof
Orders). The third group of Spoof Orders caused the total number of contracts at that level of the
order book to more than quadruple. One millisecond after placing the third group of Spoof
Orders, at 8:05:46.240 AM, the second Genuine Order resumed trading and its twenty-six
remaining contracts instantly filled by 8:05:46.241 AM. Having completely filled the second
Genuine Order, Mohan then proceeded to cancel the third group of Spoof Orders at 8:05:47.085
AM and the second group of Spoof Orders at 8:05:47.421 AM. Mohanâs cancellation of the
third group of Spoof Orders came less than one second after the second Genuine Order was fully
filled and less than one second after he placed the third group of Spoof orders. Mohanâs
cancellation of the second group of Spoof Orders came less than one and one-half seconds after
the second Genuine Order was fully filled and less than two and one-half seconds after he placed
the second group of Spoof orders.
ii. December 2, 2013âDecember 2013 E-mini NASDAQ Contract

50. Mohan executed his Scheme in the early morning of December 2, 2013, in the E-
mini NASDAQ contract. See Ex. B. At 3:01:50.862 AM Central Time, Mohan placed an
iceberg order to buy forty E-mini NASDAQ contracts (with only one contract visible to the
market) at the best-bid level (first Genuine Order). Approximately ten seconds later, at the
second-ask level, Mohan placed two groups of orders, both groups via an order splitter, to

collectively sell eighty E-mini NASDAQ contracts at 3:02:00.909 AM (first group of Spoof

Orders) and 3:02:01.327 AM (second group of Spoof Orders). Together, the two groups of
Spoof Orders caused the total number of contracts then resting at that level of the order book to
more than quadruple. At 3:02:02.279 AM, approximately one second after he placed the second
group of Spoof Orders, the first Genuine Order began to trade and completely filled within four
milliseconds by 3:02:02.283 AM. Having completely filled the first Genuine Order, Mohan then
proceeded to cancel both the first group of Spoof Orders and the second group of Spoof Orders
at 3:02:02.735 AM through 3:02:02.736 AM, less than a half-second after the first Genuine
Order was fully filled. Mohan cancelled the first group of Spoof Orders and the second group of
Spoof Orders less than two seconds after he placed both groups of orders.

51. | Almost two seconds later, Mohan repeated his spoofing pattern on the other side
of the market. At 3:02:04.670 AM, Mohan placed an iceberg order to sell 40 E-mini NASDAQ
contracts (with one contract showing to the market) at the best-ask level (second Genuine Order).
Approximately six seconds later, at 3:02:11.103 AM, Mohan placed multiple orders, via an order
splitter, to collectively buy forty E-mini NASDAQ contracts at the best-bid level (third group of
Spoof Orders). The third group of Spoof Orders caused the total number of contracts then
resting at that level of the order book to more than triple. The second Genuine Order
immediately began to trade at 3:02:11.104 AM, filling in full five milliseconds later at
3:02:11.109 AM. Having completely filled the second Genuine Order, Mohan then proceeded to
cancel the third group of Spoof Orders between 3:02:11.878 AM and 3:02:11.879 AMâless
than one second after the second Genuine Order fully filled and less than one second after he

placed the third group of Spoof Orders.
ii. December 9, 2013âDecember 2013 E-mini NASDAQ Contract

52. A third example containing Genuine Orders on both sides of the market occurred
in the overnight session of December 9, 2013. See Ex. C. At 5:27:41.553 AM Central Time,
Mohan placed an iceberg order to buy forty E-mini NASDAQ contracts (showing only one
contract to the market) at the best-bid level (first Genuine Order). Just over one second later, at
5:27:42.713 AM, Mohan placed multiple orders, via an order splitter, to collectively sell forty E-
mini NASDAQ contracts at the second-ask level (first group of Spoof Orders). The first group
of Spoof Orders caused the total number of contracts then resting at that level of the order book
to increase five-fold. At 5:27:43.225 AM, approximately a half-second after placing the first
group of Spoof Orders, Mohan placed another group of orders, via an order splitter, to
collectively sell forty E-mini NASDAQ contracts at the best-ask level (the second group of
Spoof Orders). The second group of Spoof Orders caused the total number of futures contracts
then resting at that level of the order book to increase by over seven-fold. At 5:27:43.228 AM,
just three milliseconds after placing the second group of Spoof Orders, Mohanâs first Genuine
Order began to trade and seventeen of the forty contracts filled within 284 milliseconds. At
5:27:44.208 AM, Mohan canceled the second group of Spoof Orders less than one second after
the first Genuine Order was partially filled and less than one second after he placed the second
group of Spoof Orders. Mohan then cancelled the first group of Spoof Orders (which was higher
in the order book and at less risk of execution) just over a second later, at 5:27:45.480 AM. The
cancellation of the first group of Spoof Orders occurred just under two seconds after the last fill
of the first Genuine Order and less than three seconds after he placed the first group of Spoof

Orders.
53. At 5:27:44.772 AM, just over one second after trading into a long position of
seventeen contracts in the E-mini NASDAQ contract (i.e., the seventeen contract buy side fill
that began at 5:27:43.228 AM referenced above in 4 52), Mohan placed an iceberg order to sell
seventeen E-mini NASDAQ contracts (with one contract showing to the market) at the best-ask
level (second Genuine Order). At 5:27:46.505 AM, Mohan placed multiple orders, via an order
splitter, to collectively buy forty E-mini NASDAQ contracts at the second-bid level (third group
of Spoof Orders). The third group of Spoof Orders caused the total number of contracts then
resting at the second-bid level to more than quadruple. Only 328 milliseconds later, at
5:27:46.833 AM, Mohan placed another group of orders, via an order splitter, to collectively buy
forty E-mini NASDAQ contracts at the best-bid level (fourth group of Spoof Orders). The fourth
group of Spoof Orders caused the total number of contracts then resting at that level of the order
book to more than quadruple. The second Genuine Order began to trade at 5:27:46.834 AM,
filling in full one millisecond later at 5:27:46.835 AM. At 5:27:47.568 AM, Mohan canceled
both his first Genuine Order (with twenty-three contracts remaining unsold) and his fourth group
of Spoof Orders, less than one second after the second Genuine Order was fully filled and less
than one second after he placed the fourth group of Spoof Orders. He canceled his third group of
Spoof Orders at 5:27:47.976 AM, just over one second after the second Genuine Order was fully
filled and just under one and one-half seconds after he placed the third group of Spoof Orders.

54. As part of a CME investigation regarding Mohanâs spoofing, CME staff
questioned Mohan about this particular Event during a recorded interview. Mohan refused to
answer any questions related to this Event, including specific questions about whether he
intended to cancel the orders described above before execution. Mohan similarly refused to

answer questions regarding other examples of order placement activity that CME staff showed to
him during the interview. Mohan also refused to answer questions on related subjects, such as
his order splitter usage, the purpose of his iceberg order usage, and the cancellation rates
associated with his order placement activity.
iv. December 3, 2013âDecember 2013 E-mini NASDAQ Contract

55. Mohanâs trading in the early morning hours of December 3, 2013, shows an Event
that did not result in execution of the Genuine Order, contrary to Mohanâs plan. See Ex. D. At
2:34:47.807 AM Central Time, Mohan placed an iceberg order to buy forty E-mini NASDAQ
contracts (showing only one to the market) at the best-bid level (Genuine Order). Approximately
one second later, at 2:34:48.887 AM, he placed multiple orders, via an order splitter, to
collectively sell forty E-mini NASDAQ contracts at the best-ask level (first group of Spoof
Orders) and quickly canceled the first group of Spoof Orders 712 milliseconds later. Between
2:34:50.767 AM and 2:34:50.768, Mohan then placed another group of orders, via an order
splitter, to collectively sell forty E-mini NASDAQ contracts at the second-ask level (second
group of Spoof Orders), followed 455 milliseconds later, at 2:34:51.223 AM, by yet another
group of orders, via an order splitter, to collectively sell forty E-mini NASDAQ contracts at the
best-ask level (third group of Spoof Orders). At 2:34:51.847 AM, Mohan canceled his third
group of Spoof Orders only 624 milliseconds after placing them; and, at 2:34:52.407 AM, he
canceled his second group of Spoof Orders less than two seconds after placing them. Mohan let
his Genuine Order rest slightly longer, but canceled it in full at 2:34:53.062 AM, just over five

seconds after he placed it.

<h1>CFTC Charges Jiongsheng Zhao with Spoofing and Engaging in a Manipulative and Deceptive Scheme</h1>

<p><b>Washington, DC</b>Â â The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced the filing of a federal court enforcement action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against DefendantÂ <b>Jiongsheng Zhao</b>, of Australia, charging him with spoofing and engaging in a manipulative and deceptive scheme in the E-mini S&amp;P 500 futures contract market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).</p>

<p>The CFTC Complaint alleges that from at least July 2012 through at least March 2017, Zhao repeatedly engaged in manipulative or deceptive acts and practices by âspoofingâ (bidding or offering with the intent to cancel the bid or offer before execution). On thousands of occasions, Zhao placed an order that he wanted to execute and thereafter entered a larger order on the opposite side of the market that he intended to cancel before execution. In placing these larger spoof orders, Zhao intentionally or recklessly sent false signals of increased supply or demand designed to trick market participants into executing against the orders he wanted filled.</p>

<p><b>CFTCâs Director of Enforcement Comments</b></p>

<p>James McDonald, the CFTCâs Director of Enforcement, stated: By injecting false information into our markets, spoofers gain an unfair advantage over law-abiding market participants, thereby hindering competition and undermining the integrity of our markets. Thatâs why the CFTC is committed to identifying this type of misconduct and holding the responsible individuals accountable.â</p>

<p>As alleged in the Complaint, Zhao carried out his scheme through a pattern of conduct that was designed to reap financial benefits from market participantsâ reactions to his larger orders, which he intended to cancel before execution. Zhao engaged in the pattern approximately 2,300 times, which included 3,100 discrete instances of spoofing.</p>

<p>In its continuing litigation, the CFTC seeks civil monetary penalties, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, trading and registration bans, and a permanent injunction against further violations of the federal commodities laws, as charged.</p>

<p>The CFTC thanks and acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the CME, and the Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission.</p>

<p>This case is brought in connection with the CFTC Division of Enforcementâs Spoofing Task Force, and the staff members responsible for this action are Laura Brookover, Allison Sizemore, Jordon Grimm, Carlin Metzger, Joyce Brandt, Christopher Reed, and Charles D. Marvine.</p>

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS

 

EASTERN DIVISION
COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING : CIVIL ACTION NO. 1:18-cv-00620
COMMISSION,
PLAINTIFF, : JURY DEMANDED
V.
JIONGSHENG ZHAO,
DEFENDANT.

 

COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,
CIVIL MONETARY PENALTIES, AND OTHER RELIEF

Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCFTCâ) alleges as follows:

I. SUMMARY

1. From at least July 2012 through at least March 2017 (the âRelevant Periodâ),
Defendant Jiongsheng Zhao (âZhaoâ) engaged in a manipulative and deceptive scheme while
placing orders for and trading futures contracts on a registered entity. In furtherance of this
scheme, Zhao repeatedly engaged in manipulative or deceptive acts and practices by âspoofingâ
(bidding or offering with the intent to cancel the bid or offer before execution). On thousands of
occasions, Zhao placed an order that he wanted to execute and thereafter entered a larger order
on the opposite side of the market that he intended to cancel before execution. In placing these
larger spoof orders, Zhao intentionally or recklessly sent false signals of increased supply or

demand designed to trick market participants into executing against the orders he wanted filled.

We TAR ke ah TA OA PS LE OP

2. By virtue of this conduct, as further described herein, Zhao has engaged in acts and
practices that violate Sections 4c(a)(5)(C) and 6(c)(1) of the Commodity Exchange Act (âActâ),
7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6c(a)(5)(C), 9(1) (2012), and Commission Regulation (âRegulationâ) 180.1(a)(1)
and (3), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 180.1(a)(1), (3) (2017).

3. The CFTC brings this action pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1
(2012), to enjoin Zhaoâs violative acts and practices and to compel Zhaoâs compliance with the
Act and Regulation. In addition, the CFTC seeks civil monetary penalties and such other relief,
including but not limited to disgorgement and trading and registration prohibitions, as the Court
deems necessary and appropriate.

Hf. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1331 (2012) (federal
question jurisdiction) and 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1345 (2012), which provides that district courts have
original jurisdiction over civil actions commenced by the United States or by any agency
expressly authorized to sue by Act of Congress. Section 6c(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(a)
(2012), authorizes the Commission to seek injunctive relief in any proper district court of the
United States against any person whenever it shall appear to the Commission that such person
has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a violations of
any provision of the Act or any rule, regulation or order thereunder.

5. Venue properly lies with this Court pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act, because
Zhao transacts business in the Northern District of Illinois, and the acts and practices in violations
of the Act and Regulation have occurred within this District.

Hil. THE PARTIES

6. Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading Commission is the independent federal

regulatory agency charged by Congress with the administration and enforcement of the Act and
Case: 1:18-cv-00620 Document #: 1 Filed: 01/28/18 Page 3 of 17 PagelD #:3

rules, regulations, and orders thereunder. The CFTC is headquartered at 1155 21st Street, NW,
Washington, DC 20581.

7. Defendant Jiongsheng Zhao is a resident of New South Wales, Australia. Zhao has
been employed by a proprietary trading firm (the âTrading Firmâ) as a trader for nearly nine
years. Zhao has never been registered with the CFTC.

IV. OTHER RELEVANT ENTITIES

8. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (âCMEâ) is a commodity exchange located at
20 S. Wacker Street, Chicago, Illinois 60606. It is registered with the CFTC as a designated
contract market and a swap execution facility.
9. CME Group Inc. (âCME Groupâ) is a Delaware corporation with its principal place
of business in Chicago, Illinois. CME Group is the holding company that owns CME.
Vv. FACTS

A. Futures Trading Background

10. A futures contract is an agreement to purchase or sell a commodity for delivery or
cash settlement in the future at a specified price. A futures contract traded on an exchange has
standard, non-negotiable contract specifications.

11. The E-mini S&P 500 Index futures contract (the âES contractâ) is traded on CME, a
registered entity. There are four ES contract delivery months: March, June, September, and
December. The ES contract is cash settled so no delivery of the stocks that make up the
underlying index takes place.

12. The ES contract trades 24 hours per day from 5:00 PM Central Time on Sunday
night to 4:00 PM Central Time on Friday afternoon, except for a 15-minute window each day
when trading halts. The trading day for the ES contract is commonly regarded as consisting of

two trading sessions: the daytime session and the overnight session. The daytime session

corresponds with open-outcry trading at the CME and runs from 8:30 AM to 3:15 PM Central
Time. The overnight session begins after the 15-minute trading halt and runs from 3:30 PM to
8:29:59 AM Central Time the next day. The daytime session corresponds with, but does not
perfectly overlap, the trading day for the stocks that make up the underlying index, which runs
from 8:30 AM to 3:00 PM Central Time on the NYSE and NASDAQ exchanges.

13. The value of the ES contract is the S&P 500 stock index multiplied by fifty dollars.
The price of the ES contract is quoted in index points, and the minimum price change allowed
during a trading session is one-quarter of an index point (0.25); thus, if a trader wished to place
an order above the last traded ES contract price of 2648.25 points, that trader would have to
place the order at 2648.50 points or higher. This minimum price change is commonly called a
âtick.â

14. An âorder,â in the context of electronic exchange trading, is a request submitted to
an exchange to buy (that is, âbidâ) or sell (that is, âofferâ or âaskâââ) a certain number of a
specified futures contract. An order is for one or more contracts. Contracts may also be called
âlots,â among other things. Orders are entered into the exchangeâs order book. When there
exists both a willing buyer and seller for a contract at a given price, a transaction occurs and is
referred to as a âfillâ (or a âtradeâ or âexecutionâ). At any time before the order is fully filled,
the trader can âcancelâ the order. When an order is canceled, the contracts that have not yet been
bought or sold are pulled from the order book.

15. Each trader can view the aggregate number of contracts and orders that all traders are
actively bidding or offering at a given price level. Only the total numbers of orders and contracts
at various price levels are visible, not the identities of the traders who placed the orders. The

best-bid level, or first-bid level, is the highest price at which someone is willing to buy. The

best-ask level, or first-ask level, 1s the lowest price at which someone is willing to sell. The bid-
ask spread is the difference between those two prices.

16. Traders can view the aggregate resting contracts and orders up to the tenth-bid and
tenth-ask levels. This combined bid and ask information is often referred to as the visible order
book and represents the visible market depth. Traders often consider information in the order
book when making trading decisions.

17. An âaggressiveâ order is an order that crosses the bid-ask spread. On the buy side of
the market, an aggressive buy order is placed at the best-ask price or higher so, put simply, it is
an offer to buy at a price that another trader is currently willing to sell. On the sell side of the
market, an aggressive sell order is placed at the best-bid price or lower so, put simply, it 1s an
offer to sell at a price that another trader is currently willing to buy. Accordingly, aggressive
orders are guaranteed to execute, at least partially, immediately after being placed.

18. A âpassiveâ order, on the other hand, does not give up the spread in price. On the
buy side of the market, a passive buy order is placed at the best-bid price or lower so, put simply,
it is an offer to buy at a price that is lower than the price that other traders are currently willing to
sell. On the sell side of the market, a passive sell order is placed at the best-ask price or higher,
so, put simply, it is an offer to sell at a price that is higher than the price that other traders are
currently willing to buy. Passive orders rest for at least some amount of time after being placed
and are not guaranteed to execute.

19. The ES contract is traded electronically on the CME Globex trading system
(âGlobexâââ). Globex employs a matching algorithm to match bids and offers for execution. The
matching algorithm for the ES market is known as âFIFO,â which denotes first-in, first-out.

Under the FIFO method, orders on the same side of the market (i.e., the buy side or sell side) and
Case: 1:18-cv-00620 Document #: 1 Filed: 01/28/18 Page 6 of 17 PagelD #:6

at the same price are filled based on time priority; thus, with a few exceptions not pertinent here,
the order that was placed first trades first, irrespective of the orderâs size.

B. Zhaoâs Manipulative and Deceptive Scheme

20. Zhao has worked as a trader at the Trading Firm for nearly nine years. In this role,
he trades futures contracts on U.S. and international exchanges. Zhao does not trade on behalf of
any party other than the Trading Firm. He shares any profits generated from his trading with the
Trading Firm. Zhaoâs direct supervisor is the Trading Firmâs CEO.

21. During the Relevant Period, Zhao engaged in a manipulative and deceptive scheme
(the âSchemeââ) that consisted of the following general pattern: (1) placing one or more passive
small orders (that is, fewer than fifty contracts) on one side of the market, which he intended to
execute (âGenuine Ordersâ); (2) placing one or more passive large orders (that is, fifty contracts
or more) on the opposite side of the market, within two minutes of placing the Genuine Order
and while the Genuine Order is still pending, which he intended to cancel (âSpoof Ordersâ);

(3) reaching at least a five-to-one total contract size imbalance between his Spoof Orders and
Genuine Orders, respectively; and (4) canceling the Spoof Orders within two seconds after they
were placed. Each instance of this pattern comprises a single âEvent.â Collectively, âGenuine
Ordersâ and âSpoof Ordersâ are referred to as âEvent Orders.â

22. Zhaoâs Scheme was designed to benefit financially from market participantsâ
reactions to his Spoof Orders. The following is a simplified explanation of how his Scheme was
intended to work, using a hypothetical example of a Spoof Order on the buy side. A large Spoof
Order to buy would result in an increase in demand in the order book (1.e., create or add to an
order book imbalance in which orders to buy outweigh orders to sell). This increase would be
visible to other market participants and may lead them to conclude that the price is likely to rise.

This conclusion, in turn, would impact market participantsâ decisions, including prompting some

to attempt to purchase contracts before the predicted rise in price happens. In such a case, these
participants would place aggressive orders to buy (1.e., at a higher price than the currently resting
bids in the market), making execution of orders resting on the opposite side of the Spoof Order
more likely. Finally, these bids would enable orders on the opposite side of the Spoof Orderâ
including Zhaoâs Genuine Ordersâto sell sooner, at a better price, or in larger quantities than
they otherwise would.

23. Zhao carried out his Scheme on the ES contract market traded on CME. For some or
all of the Relevant Period, Zhao traded manually, by submitting orders, cancelations, and
modifications using a computer mouse or keyboard.

24. During the Relevant Period, as part of the ongoing Scheme, Zhao engaged in
approximately 2,300 Events. As part of those Events, Zhao entered about 2,300 Genuine Orders
and 3,100 Spoof Orders, with all of the Spoof Orders, according to the pattern described herein,
quickly being canceled.

25. Zhao intended to cancel the Spoof Orders before execution, and often did so after his
Genuine Orders were filled. The predictable sequence inherent in Zhaoâs spoofing pattern,
which he engaged in thousands of times, demonstrates that Zhao was not reacting to market
changes when he canceled the Spoof Orders; rather, he was carrying out a predetermined
strategy that was not dependent on market conditions.

26. By engaging in the Scheme as described herein, Zhao entered Spoof Orders either to
intentionally send a false signal to the market that he actually wanted to buy or sell the number of
contracts specified in the Spoof Orders, or while recklessly disregarding the fact that entering his
spoof orders would send such a false signalâa signal that injected false information about

supply and demand into the market that could affect market activity. Zhao engaged in this

Scheme to trick other market participants into executing against his Genuine Orders on the
opposite side of the marketâallowing them to fill sooner, at a better price, or in larger quantities
than they otherwise would. Zhao knew or recklessly disregarded that the Spoof Orders would
create the false appearance of market depth and result in misinformation, thereby luring market
participants to trade based on Zhaoâs spoofing. The risk that the Spoof Orders could mislead
other market participants into believing there was genuine interest in purchasing or selling the
specified number of contracts represented by Zhaoâs Spoof Orders was so obvious that Zhao
must have been aware of it. He knew that his Spoof Orders would appear in the order book and
that traders often consider order-book information in making trading decisions; thus, Zhao was,
at least, reckless with respect to the danger that his Spoof Orders would mislead other market
participants.

27. Although Zhaoâs Spoof Orders were visible to the rest of the market, his identity as
the originator of those orders was not. Only the total numbers of orders and contracts at various
price levels are visible, not the number of traders or identities of the traders who placed the
orders. Accordingly, Zhao knew that other market participants could not see that the same trader
had placed both the Spoof Orders and the Genuine Orders, which might have tipped off market
participants that his Spoof Orders were not bona fide.

28. Trading overnight was a key component of Zhaoâs Scheme and indicative of his
wrongful intent. Zhao carried out his Scheme more than 99% of the time during overnight
sessions, when trading volume and volatility were substantially decreased. As a result of the
reduced volume and volatility depth during overnight sessions, Zhao was able to use smaller

Spoof Orders (with concomitant lower financial risk) to provoke the market reactions he desired.

29. The near-perfect correlation between Zhaoâs Scheme and his use of overnight
sessions cannot be explained by his residing in Australia, where the overnight session largely
occurs during daylight hours. Setting the Scheme aside, Zhao often traded during daytime
sessions, which overlaps with nighttime in Australia. Indeed, nearly one-third of Zhaoâs non-
Event orders (1.e., orders that were not part of the Scheme) were placed during daytime sessions;
thus, Zhaoâs focus on carrying out his Scheme almost exclusively during overnight sessions 1s
indicative of his wrongful intent.

30. Further, Zhaoâs trading pattern shows he avoided placing large Spoof Orders when
they were more likely to execute. Had Zhao actually wanted to trade the quantities in his Spoof
Orders, he would have placed similar-size orders during daytime sessions, when trading volume
was higher and the larger quantities were more likely to execute; however, he did not. As
reflected in the table below, during the Relevant Period, Zhao placed only about 2% of his large
orders (both Spoof and non-Spoof) during daytime sessions. By contrast, Zhao placed about
29% of his small orders during daytime sessions; thus, Zhao avoided placing large orders when
they had better chances of executing, but he did not similarly curtail his small orders. This
further indicates that large order sizes were not an aspect of Zhaoâs legitimate trading. Rather,
they were part of a scheme to mislead market participants by falsely signaling increased supply

or demand for the purpose of luring market participants to trade based on his spoofing.

31. Zhaoâs Scheme frequently worked as planned; that is, his Spoof Orders tricked other
market participants into executing against his Genuine Orders. However, there were times that
Zhaoâs Genuine Orders continued to sit, unfilled, even after he placed and canceled his Spoof
Orders; thus, not all of the Events resulted in executions of Zhaoâs Genuine Orders. Still, Zhaoâs
Genuine Orders seldom terminated in cancelations, again demonstrating the differing intent
behind his Spoof and Genuine Orders. Even though, by definition, 100% of Spoof Orders
terminated with at least a partial cancelation, the same was true for only about 22% of the
Genuine Orders. The difference is that Zhao wanted his Genuine Orders to execute.

32. Zhao also took steps to protect his Spoof Orders from execution. For example, he
canceled the Spoof Orders almost immediately after placing them; their median cancelation time
was 737 milliseconds, as illustrated in the table below. By contrast, on those rarer occasions
when Zhao canceled his Genuine Orders, the median cancelation time was 106 seconds. This
means that Zhao allowed his Genuine Orders to rest prior to cancelation for a much longer period
than his Spoof Orders. The consistently fast cancelation times for Zhaoâs Spoof Orders reflect

his intent to cancel them from the outset.

33. Zhaoâs efforts to avoid execution of his Spoof Order were successful. This is
reflected in vastly diverging rates in which Zhaoâs Genuine and Spoof Orders were partially or
fully filled (the âhit rateâ). As reflected in the table below, Zhao placed approximately 2,300
Genuine Orders during the Relevant Period. Of these, about 79% were hit. By contrast, less
than 1% of the approximately 3,100 Spoof Orders were hit. Thus, Zhaoâs Genuine Orders were
about 180 times more likely to be hit. As a general matter, whether an order is hit is not
dependent on its size; rather, orders at the same price level execute according to time priority
under the FIFO matching algorithm. Here, the stark contrast in hit rates results from differences
in the ordersâ relative competitiveness, over which Zhao had control, and illustrates his success

in avoiding execution of his Spoof Orders.

Case: 1:18-cv-00620 Document #: 1 Filed: 01/28/18 Page 12 of 17 PagelD #:12

34. The use of large orders was a hallmark of Zhaoâs Scheme; he rarely placed large
orders otherwise. He placed about 3,800 large orders during the Relevant Period; 82% of those
were placed pursuant to the Scheme as Spoof Orders. By contrast, Zhao placed about 62,700
small orders during the Relevant Period. Only about 4% of these orders fell within the Scheme
as Genuine Orders. Zhaoâs limited use of large order sizes, nearly always as part of the Scheme
and not as part of a legitimate trading strategy, is indicative of his illegal conduct. He primarily
used large orders to send false signals of increased supply or demand to market participants.

C. Examples of Zhaoâs Scheme

35. Zhaoâs Scheme 1s illustrated in the three Events set forth below. Detailed trade data
associated with these Events is provided in Exhibit A to this Complaint.

I. Event Example 1: April 15, 2013

36. Zhaoâs trading in the early morning of April 15, 2013 constitutes an Event pursuant
to his Scheme. See Ex. A at 1â8 (displaying detailed trade data). At 1:11:16.287 AM Central
Time (denoted in hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds), Zhao placed an order to sell one
contract (the Genuine Order) at the best-ask level. See id. at 1, row 2. About ten seconds later,
at 1:11:25.537 AM, Zhao placed an order to buy 151 contracts at the best-bid level (the first
Spoof Order). See id. at 2, row 33. The first Spoof Order doubled the number of contracts then
resting at that level of the order book, but the order was not at risk of executing until the 151
contracts resting ahead of it executed or were withdrawn. Zhaoâs first Spoof Order did not
immediately induce execution of his Genuine Order, and he canceled it at 1:11:26.240 AM (only
703 milliseconds after placing it). See id. at 2, row 47. A short time later, Zhao tried again. At
1:11:33.363 AM, he placed an order to buy 171 contracts at the best-bid level (the second Spoof
Order), more than doubling the number of contracts resting at that level of the order book. See

id. at 3, row 89. This time, Zhaoâs Genuine Order executed at 1:11:33.366 AM, immediately

after the second Spoof Order was placed. See id. at 4, row 103. He then canceled his second
Spoof Order at 1:11:34.161 AM, within 798 milliseconds of placing it. See id. at 8, row 252.

2. Event Example 2: March 5, 2014

37. Zhaoâs trading in the final hours of March 5, 2014 shows an Event that did not result
in execution of the Genuine Order, contrary to Zhaoâs plan. See Ex. A at 9-12. At 22:44:12.924
PM Central Time, Zhao placed an order to buy one contract (the Genuine Order) at the best-bid
level. See id. at 9, row 2. Three seconds later, at 22:44:15.720 PM, Zhao placed an order to sell
201 contracts (the Spoof Order) at the best-ask level. See id. at 9, row 15. Zhaoâs Spoof Order
was nearly 2.5 times the size of the combined orders then resting at that price level of the order
book, but it was not at risk of executing until the 82 contracts resting ahead of it executed or
were withdrawn. Zhaoâs Genuine Order did not immediately execute. Zhao canceled his Spoof
Order at 22:44:16.394 PM, only 674 milliseconds after placing it. See id. at 10, row 40. He let
his Genuine Order rest longer, but canceled it as well at 22:44:40.533 PM, about half a minute
after placing it. See id. at 12, row 97.

3. Event Example 3: March 21, 2016

38. A third example occurred on March 21, 2016. See Ex. A at 13-18. At 7:31:28.726
AM Central Time, Zhao placed an order to sell 11 contracts (the Genuine Order) at the best-ask
level. See id. at 13, row 2. About five seconds later, at 7:31:33.645 AM, Zhao placed an order
to buy 82 contracts (the Spoof Order) at the best-bid level. See id. at 13, row 441. The Spoof
Order was over half the size of the combined orders then resting at that price level, but 1t was not
at risk of executing until the 153 contracts resting ahead of it executed or were withdrawn.
Almost immediately, at 7:31:33.980 AM and 7:31:33.981 AM, Zhaoâs Genuine Order executed

through one trade of one and one trade of ten contracts. See id. at 13, rows 456 & 458. Zhao

then canceled his Spoof Order at 7:31:34.389 AM, just 744 milliseconds after placing it. See id.

<h1>CFTC Charges Jitesh Thakkar and Edge Financial Technologies, Inc. with Aiding and Abetting Spoofing and Manipulative and Deceptive Scheme</h1>

<p><b>Washington, DC</b>Â â The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced the filing of a federal court enforcement action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, chargingÂ <b>Jitesh ThakkarÂ </b>of Naperville, Illinois, and his company,Â <b>Edge Financial Technologies, Inc.</b>(Edge), with aiding and abetting spoofing and a manipulative and deceptive scheme in the E-mini S&amp;P futures contract market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (E-mini S&amp;P).</p>

<p><b>CFTCâs Director of Enforcement Comments</b></p>

<p>James McDonald, the CFTCâs Director of Enforcement, stated: âIn its effort to root out spoofing from our markets, the CFTC will work vigorously to hold accountable not only the individuals who engage in the spoofing, but also those who produce and sell the tools designed to spoof. The CFTC appreciates the innovative promise of financial technology in our markets, but when those technologies are designed to violate the law, the Division of Enforcement will step in to protect our markets and market participants from that unlawful activity.â</p>

<p>According to Complaint, Thakkar is the president of Edge and has over eighteen years of experience programming custom software applications for the trading industry. In OctoberÂ 2011, Trader A, who cooperated with the CFTC in the course of this investigation, reached out to Thakkar and asked Thakkar and Edge to design and develop a custom trading software application that would help Trader A spoof (bidding or offering with the intent to cancel before execution) and inject false information into the market regarding supply and demand for the E-mini S&amp;P. Thakkar, along with Edge programmers working at Thakkarâs direction, worked closely with Trader A to meet Trader Aâs desired specifications.</p>

<p>The CFTC Complaint alleges that Trader A repeatedly engaged in thousands of manipulative or deceptive acts and practices by spoofing. The Complaint further alleges that Thakkar and Edge aided and abetted Trader Aâs spoofing by designing and developing for Trader A the custom trading software application he requested, which included a âBack-of-Bookâ function that Thakkar and Edge understood Trader A would use to engage in spoofing.</p>

<p>According to the Complaint, Thakkar and Edge designed the Back-of-Book function with two features that helped Trader A spoof: First, the Back-of-Book function, when enabled, automatically and continuously modified Trader Aâs order at a particular price level by one lot. Under the rules of the order matching system in place for the E-mini S&amp;P, these one-lot modifications repeatedly moved Trader Aâs order behind the orders of other market participants, where Trader Aâs orders were less likely to result in executed trades. Second, the Back-of-Book function, when enabled, immediately and automatically cancelled Trader Aâs order at a particular price level as soon as any portion of his order was executed. Together, these features designed by Thakkar and Edge enabled Trader A to place and leave large orders in the E-mini S&amp;P at multiple price levels that appeared to be genuine orders, but which Trader A intended to and did cancel before execution. Thakkar and Edgeâs application allowed Trader A to send false signals of supply and demand for the E-mini S&amp;P and trick other market participants into reacting to these false signals.</p>

<p>According to the Complaint, Trader A used the Back-of-Book function to spoof in the E-mini S&amp;P at least between January 30, 2013 and October 30, 2013. The Complaint alleges that because Thakkar and Edge aided and abetted Trader A by designing and developing the Back-of-Book function, they are responsible for Trader Aâs spoofing and manipulative or deceptive acts and practices using the Back-of-Book function from January 30, 2013 through October 30, 2013.</p>

<p>In its continuing litigation, the CFTC seeks civil monetary penalties, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, trading and registration bans, and a permanent injunction against future violations of the federal commodities laws, as charged.</p>

<p>The CFTC thanks and acknowledges the assistance of the CME Group, U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>

<p>This case is brought in connection with the CFTC Division of Enforcementâs Spoofing Task Force, and the staff members responsible for this action are Margaret Aisenbrey, Allison Sizemore, Carlin Metzger, Joyce Brandt, Thomas Simek, and Charles Marvine.</p>

Defendants.

 

COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELDER, CIVIL MONETARY PENALTOIOS, AND
OTHER KOUPTABLE RELIEF

Plaintiff Commodity Putures Trading Commission CCPTCâ) alleges as follows:
E, SUMMARY

1, From at least January 30, 2013 through October 30, 2013, Trader A engaged in
âspoofingâ Chidding or offering with the intent to cancel the bid or offer before execution), and
employed a manipulative and deceptive scheme, involving the E-mini S&P 500 futures near
month contract (E-mini S&Pâ) listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Inc. (âCMEâ). As
part of this scheme, Trader A used a custom trading software application that contained a
function called âBack of Book.â This Back-of-Book function helped Trader A place orders that
he intended to cancel before execution (Spoof Ordersâ) by minimizing the chance that these
Spoof Orders would result in executed trades before Trader A could cancel them.

2. Defendant Jitesh Thakkar (""Thakkarâ), a computer programmer, and his
company, Edge Pinancial Technologies, Inc. (âEdgeâ), designed and developed the custom

trading software application for Trader A, including the Back-of-Book function beginning in fall

of 2011 and continuing through 2015 (the âRelevant Periodâ). Thakkar and Edge designed the
Back-of-Book function with two features that were designed to help Trader A place Spoof
Orders. First, the Back-of-Book function continually modified Trader Aâs Spoof Orders so that
these Spoof Orders remained at the back of the order queue at each price level on the CME
Globex trading system (Globexâ), where they were less likely to be executed. Second, the
Back-of-Book function automatically canceled Trader Aâs entire Spoot Order as soon as any
portion of his Spoof Order was hit or lifted by another market participant. Using the Back-otf-
Book function, Trader A was able to place large Spoof Orders, often at or near the best bid or
offer, that injected false information about supply and demand for the E-mini S&P and tricked
other market participants into trading based on Trader Aâs spoofing.

3, When Thakkar and Edge designed the Back-of-Book function for Trader A, they
understood that Trader A would use the Back-of-Book function to engage m spoofing and myect
false information into the market about supply and demand for the E-mini S&P.

4. By designing the Back-of-Book function with the intent to help Trader A engage
in spoofing, Thakkar and Edge aided and abetted Trader Aâs spooting and his manipulative and
deceptive scheme. Thakkar and Edge are thus responsible as if they were prmecipals under
Section 13{a)} of the Commodity Exchange Act (âActâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§ [3cla}) (2012), for Trader Aâs
violations of Sections 4c(ay(S)y(C) and 6(c)(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. $8 6c(a), 9C1), (3) (2012), and
Commission Regulation (Regulationâ)180. t(a)(1) and (3), 17 CLPLR. Â§ 180. PCa), G) (2017).

5. The CFTC brings this action pursuant to Section 6c(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-
Ia} (2012), to enjom Thakkarâs and Edgeâs unlawful acts and practices and to compel their
comphance with the Act and Regulation. In addition, the CFTC seeks civil monetary penalties

and such other equitable relief as this Court deems necessary or appropriate.

HY. FACTS

A. The E-mini S&P Market

Li. The E-mini S&P is traded on CME, a registered entity. Trading in the E-mini
S&P is conducted electronically via Globex. On Gicbex, traders have the ability to enter,
modify, and cancel orders in a matter of milliseconds through a computer portal that accesses the
Globex platform.

12. An âorder,â mm the context of electronic exchange trading, is a request submitted
to an exchange to buy (âbidâ) or sell offerâ or âaskââ) a certain number of a specified futures
contract. An order is for one or more contracts. Contracts may also be called âlots,â among
other things. When an order to âbuyâ or âsellâ futures contracts ts placed on Giobex, the order
becomes part of the exchangeâs order book. When one or more contracts in an order are bought
or sold, the result is an executed trade. A buy order or bid that results in an executed trade is said
to be âhit.â A sell order or offer that results in an executed trade is said to be âlifted.â

13. The order book displays the total order volume at ten price levels on both the buy
and sell sides of the market to all traders. The first-bid, or best-bid, level in the order book ts the
highest price at which someone ts willing to buy. The first-offer, or best-offer, level in the order

book is the lowest price at which someone is willmg to sell. Globex functions such that all of the

4
orders at the best bid or best offer price level must be traded Chitâ or âliftedâ) before any orders
at the next available best bid or offer price can be traded.

14, Traders can view the aggregate number of contracts being bid or offered at each
of the ten price levels on the buy or sell side of the market, but it is typically not possible for
market participants to identity individual orders within the order book. This combined bid and
offer information is often referred to as the visible order book and represents the visible market
depth. Traders often consider information in the order book when making trading decisions.

tS. For the E-Mini S&P, Globex utilizes a âfirst in, first outâ matching system for
determining which orders within a given price level are matched, or executed against, another
order. This matching system places orders at the same price level in a queue, arranged from first
received to last received, meaning orders later in the queue are less likely to result in executed
trades. During the Relevant Period, the Globex âfirst in, first outâ matching systern dictated that
if the quantity of an order was increased (but not if uf was decreased) that order would be moved
to the back of the queue at that price fevel, as if it were an entirely new order.

%. At Trader Aâs Request, Thakkar and Edge Designed and Developed the
Back-of-Book Function To Help Trader A Engage in Spoofing

16. Thakkar and Edge designed and developed the Back-of-Book function to exploit
the Globex matching system and help Trader A place Spoof Orders in the E-mini S&P. At
Trader Aâs request, Thakkar and Edge designed the Back-of-Book function with two features.
First, the Back-of-Book function, when enabled, automatically and continuously modified Trader
Aâs order at a particular price level down and then up by one lot whenever a certain number of
contracts were placed at the same price level after Trader Aâs Spoof Order entered the market.
ach time the function automatically modified Trader Aâs order up by one lot, Trader Aâs order

was moved by the Globex matching system to the back of the queue behind the orders of other
tnarket participants at that price level, where Trader Aâs orders were less likely to be executed.
Second, the Back-of-Book function, when enabled, immediately and automatically cancelled
Trader Aâs order at a particular price level as soon as any portion of his order was hit or lifted by
another market participant. These features of the Back-of-Book function enabled Trader A to
place and leave large orders in the E-mini S&P at various price levels, including at or near the
best bid or offer, that appeared to other market participants to be genuine orders, while
minimizing the risk that these large orders would be hit or lifted before Trader A could cancel
them. This allowed Trader A to send false signals of supply and demand for the E-mini S&P and
induce other market participants to react to these false signals.

17. Thakkar and Edge began designing and developing a custom trading software
application for Trader A that included the Back-of-Book function in October ZO11 after Trader A
reached out to Thakkar for help. Beginning in October 2011, Thakkar and Trader A
communicated by phone, emails, and web meetings to discuss Trader Aâs specific requirements
for the application, including the Back-of-Book function. In these communications, Trader A
was unpressed by Thakkarâs and Edgeâs experience with programming trading software
applications,

18. Beginning with an email on October 12, 2011 and in subsequent communications,
Trader A asked Thakkar to design and develop within the custom trading software application
several custom order types he could use to place orders to buy and sell the E-mini S&P. These
order types included âJoinâ and âJoin Sideâ orders. Trader A explained to Thakkar that the Join
order type should automatically place either a bid or an offer order for the specified quantity
whenever either the price level that had been the best offer became the best bid or the price level

that bad been the best bid became the best offer. As Trader A described to Thakkar âSo if T

placed a 300 fot JOIN on the bid at 51 and it is trading 53-54. Tf either the 33 Bid or the 54 Offer
is traded out then my 300 will appear at the same tume at S1.â

19, Trader A explained to Thakkar that the Join Side order type should automatically
place a bid if the price level that had been the best offer became the best bid, and automatically
place an offer sf the price level that had been the best bid became the best offer. As Trader A
stated to Thakkar, â... in the above example the 300 lot will only jom the S51 bid if the 54 offer is
traded and the price goes 54 Bid.â

20, Trader 4 told Thakkar that for both the Jom and Join Side order types he wanted
the custom trading application to include a check box that when selected applied the Back-of-
Book function to the Join and Jom Side order types. Trader A toid Thakkar that he wanted the
Back-of-Book function to include two features. First, Trader A explained to Thakkar in the
October 12, 2011, email that:

âPor both of the above order types we need to have the option to

keep the order at the back of the book... we will have to make it

that the order is increased by | every time an order greater than say

20 lots is placed. Thuis value may be subject to change.â
Trader A told Thakkar that he planned to use the Back-of-Book function to trade the E-mini
S&P. Thakkar understood that under the Globex matching system for the E-mini S&P,
increasing an order by one lot would move an order to the back of the queue al a particular price
level in the E-Mint S&P order book. The Back-of-Book Spoof Order would not be hit or lifted
until after all the visible orders ahead of the Back-of-Book Spoof Order at that price level were
filled.

24. Second, Trader A told Thakkar that if an order placed with the Back-of-Book
function was hit or lifted by an order placed by another market participant, the Back-of-Bock

function would immediately and automatically cancel the remaining, unfilled portion of Trader
Aâs order before it could be hit or lifted by another order. Trader A specified to Thakkar in an
email on November 4, 2011, that for orders placed with the Back-of-Book function, â[t]he order
is deleted when the first clip is hit inte it, whether that chp is a i lot or LOO lot.â

22. Trader A requested that Thakkar and Edge include this automatic cancellation
feature to make it easier for him to cancel the Jom and Jom Side orders he placed with the Back-
of-Book function, before any of these orders resulted in an executed trade. According to Trader
A, he always intended to cancel any Join or Join Side order he placed with the Back-of-Book
function enabled.

23. Begimnime in October 2011, Thakkar and Edge designed and developed the Back-
of-Book function to meclude these two features. Thakkar directed Edge employees to begin work
on the programming, and he oversaw their progress. In a document Thakkar emailed to Trader A
on November 10, 2011, Thakkar explained his understanding of the features that Trader A had
requested and told Trader A that that he and Edge were designing the custom trading software
application to function exactly as described:

e âTf âBack-of-Bookâ option is checked, based on the threshold gty (assume the
default value 10 is used), the app will increase/decrease the order qty by | lot
(after this ... order is activated) every time new lots more than 10 (exclude 10} are
placed on this order. Example: another 10+ qty order comes, change to 299,
another 10+ gty order comes, change to 300. Keep changing between 299 or
300.â
Â® âTfand only i âBack of the bookâ option is checked for this... order, upon partial

fill event, unfilled qty will be deleted.â
24. Thakkar provided the initial version of the custom trading software application to
Trader A on November 16, 2011. Trader A responded that â[o]verall, fm quite unpressed and
excited with it.â

25. After November 16, 2011, Thakkar and Edge continued to further design and
develop the custom trading software application to improve tts operation and address problems
raised by Trader A. Thakkar participated in several web meetings with Trader A in which
Thakkar had the opportunity to observe Trader Aâs trading of the E-mini S&P and hear Trader A
explain how he wanted the Back-of-Book function to operate.

20, Thakkar sent Trader A updated versions of the custom trading software
application on December 14, 2011, and again on January 10, 2012. Between January and May of
2012, Thakkar, and other Edge programmers working at Thakkarâs direction, continued to
communicate with Trader A and make modifications to the operation of the application,
including the Back-of-Book function.

af, Thakkar and Edge designed and developed the Back-of-Book function in order to
help Trader A place Spoof Orders and inject false mformation regarding supply and demand for
the E-mini S&P into the market. Throughout the design and development of the Back-of-Book
function, Phakkar understood that Trader A imtended to use the Back-of-Book function to place
Spoot Orders. Thakkar knew that Trader A wanted orders placed with the Back-of-Book
function always to remain behind other orders at a particular price level, minimizing the chance
that Trader Aâs orders would result in executed trades. Based on Trader Aâs request that the
Back-of-Book function immediately and automatically cancel any order placed with the Back-of-
Book function as soon a5 any portion of that order was hit or lifted by an order from another

market participant, Thakkar understood that Trader A intended to cancel these Back-of-Book
orders before they resulted in an executed trade. Thakkar further understood that together, these
two features of the Back-of-Book function would help Trader A send false signals of supply and
demand for the E-mini S&P to other market participants by giving Trader A a way to place and
leave large orders which appeared to other market participants to be genuine orders, but which
Trader A intended to cancel before they resulted in executed trades.

25, Based on his experience working with traders to design and develop trading
software applications, Thakkar knew and understood that market participants consider
information in the order book when making trading decisions. Thakkar further knew and
understood that market participants would react to the false signals communicated by the Spoot
Orders Trader A intended to place with the Back-of-Book function and use that information in
making trading decisions. Thakkar and Edge designed and developed the Back-of-Book
function to heip Trader A accomplish his goal of tricking other market participants and lurmg
therm into making decisions and executing trades based on the false signals communicated by his
Spoof Orders.

29, Thakkarâs understanding that Trader A intended to use the Back-of-Book function
to place Spoof Orders is reflected in the contract between Edge and Trader A that Thakkar
prepared and sent to Trader A on or around January 25, 2012. In this contract, Thakkar
sipmmarized the various functions and features that Edge would program into the custom trading
software application, including the Back-of-Book function. In the contract, Thakkar noted that
âhe [Trader A] doesnât want to be hit on the join ordersâ placed with the Back-of-Book function.
Trader A agreed to this contract and signed it electronically sometime on or around January 25,

2012. Thakkar signed the contract on behalf of Edge.
30. in his communications with Thakkar regarding his requirements for the custom
trading software application, Trader A gave Thakkar examples of how he wanted the various
functions, mchiding the Back-of-Book function, to operate. In those examples he gave to
Thakkar, Trader A consistently referenced order sizes of approximately 300 contracts. Thakkar
understood that Trader A planned to use the Back-of-Book function to place orders of
approximately 300 contracts in the E-mini S&P order book order that Trader A did not want to
be hit or lifted on.

34. Thakkar also understood that Trader A wanted to conceal the behavior of the
orders that he placed with the Back-ol-Book function from other traders in the market. Trader A
asked Thakkar to design the Back-of-Book function so that it did not move Trader Aâs order to
the back of the queue every time another market participant placed an order at that price level,
but only when the new order exceeded a certain minimum quantity. Trader A told Thakkar that
increasing and decreasing the size of his order by one lot every time a new order was placed
âstarted to look a little strange with 1 lots changing all the time, so we will have to make tt that
the order is mcreased by | every time an order greater than say 20 lots is placed. This value may
be subject to change.â

32, Thakkar recognized that the custom trading software application he designed and
developed for Trader A, mmcliding the Back-of-Book function, was a powerful tool containing
functions and features that would be useful and valuable for other traders. As a result, Thakkar
sought to capitalize on it. Thakkar and Edge initially offered to design and develop the
application âfor a fixed price of $12,500 for the projects, with rights to resell the app. This is
sort of below cost for us, but we would do uf in hopes to make money by selling i to other

customers.â Thakkar later increased the price of the application to $24,200 in the January 25,
2012 contract between Trader A and Edge, which incorporated additional specifications from
Trader A, but reserved in that contract âall rights to modify, use or sell any cade, or derivative
work in any form.â

33. During the time when Thakkar and Edge designed and developed the Back-of-
Book function for Trader A, Thakkar was knowledgeable regarding the various strategies used
by high frequency and algorithmic traders. Thakkar was also familiar with how these trading
strategies could affect and did affect trading in futures markets, including the potential for certaim
trading strategies to cause disruptions to orderly trading in futures markets. During the time
when Thakkar and Edge designed and developed the Back-of-Book function for Trader A,
Thakkar understood and was familiar with the practice of spoofing. Beginning in March 2012,
Thakkar participated in the CFTCâs Technology Advisory Committee's Subcommittee on High
Frequency Trading. The Subcommittee on High Prequency Trading was formed to analyze and
develop recommendations regarding the definition of high frequency trading in the context of the
larger universe of automated trading. In this capacity, Thakkar participated in a working group
consisting of representatives from a variety of firms in the trading industry, as well as CPPC
staff. One of the topics addressed by the working group in which Thakkar participated was
trading practices and strategies that used high frequency trading techniques, including spoofing.

C. Trader A Used the Back-of-Book Function To Engage in Spoofing

34. Trader A used the Back-of-Book function developed by Thakkar and Edge to
place Spoof Orders at various price levels of the visible order book for the E-mini S&P,
including at the best bid or the best offer. Trader A used the Back-of-Book function to place
Spoof Orders in the visible E~-mim S&P order book, where they appeared to be genuine orders

and tricked other traders into thinking that Trader A actually wanted to buy or sell the number of
contracts specified in these Spoof Orders. Trader A intended to cancel these Spoof Orders
before they resulted in executed trades.

33, By placing these Spoof Orders with the Back-of-Book function, Trader A
minimized the chance that these Spoof Orders would be hit or lifted by other market participants
and was able to automatically cancel these Spoof Orders before they resulted in executed trades.
The purpose of the Spoof Orders Trader A placed with the Back-of-Book function was to place
large orders in the visible E-mini S&P order book to affect prices, but minimize the chances that
such orders would result in executed trades. The Back-of-Book function helped Trader A inject
false information into the market regarding supply and/or demand for the E-mini S&P and lure
other market participants into reacting to this false information. Trader A was thus able to trick
other market participants into executing against orders he placed on the opposite side of the
market-âallowing Trader A to profit, mitigate potential losses, and/or liquidate pasitions al more
favorable prices than were otherwise available without the use of the Back-of-Book Program.

36. Trader A used the Back-of-Book function to engage in spoofing in the E-mini
contract between at least January 30, 2013 and October 30, 2013.

37. For example, on February 22, 2013, at approximately 10:17:07 CST, Trader A
placed a 722-lot Back-of-Book Spoof Order to buy at 150400 in the Marchi3 E-nsini S&P
contract (the 150400 Spoof Order}. The 150400 Spoof Order was at the third-best bid and jomed
2,034 other lots at that level. The Back-of-Book function designed and developed by Thakkar
and Edge automatically modified this order, switching between 722 and 723 lots a total of 25
times and returning to the end of the queue of outstanding buy orders on the CME at 150400
each time it increased its volume by one lot. As a result, this Back-of-Book Spoof Order

remaimed on the market, unexecuted, for nearly two minutes. By the time Trader A canceled the
order, the 150400 Spoof Order was at the best bid and made up nearly forty percent of total order
quantity at that price level. While the 150400 Spoof Order was on the market, Trader A placed a
376-lot sell order at the price of [50450 and was filled.

38. In another instance, on Pebruary 25, 2013, at approximately 12:48:52 CST,
Trader A used the Back-of-Book function to place three 796-lot Spoof Orders to sell the
Marchi3 E-mini S&P contract. These Back-of-Book Spoot Orders were placed at prices of
130459 (150450 Spoof Order), 150475 (150475 Spoof Order), and 150500 (150500 Spoof
Order). At the time Trader A placed these orders, the 150450 Spoof Order was at the best offer,
or level 1 of the order book and comprised 49 percent of the 1,634 total lots in the order book at
that level. The 150475 Spoof Order was placed at the third best offer, or level 3 of the order
book, and comprised 34 percent of the 2,357 total lots in the order book at that level. The
150508 spoof order was placed at the fourth best offer, or level 4 of the order book, and
comprised 39 percent of the 2,043 total Lots im the order book at that level. Over the next several
seconds, the Back-of-Book function designed and developed by Thakkar and Edge automatically
modified each of these orders. Specifically, the 150450 Spoof Order was modified 13 times,
flipping back and forth between 796 and 797 lots, ensuring that it remained behind other offers
in the queue and stayed on the market, unexecuted, for approximately 12 seconds, until Trader A
canceled the order. The 150475 Spoof Order was modified LO tomes, flipping back and forth
between 796 and 797 lots, ensuring that it remained behind other offers in the queue and stayed
on the market, unexecuted, for approximately 24 seconds, until Trader A cancelled the order
(after that price level had become the best offer on the market}. The [50500 Spoof Order was

D. Thakkar and Edge Continued To Support Trader Aâs Custom Trading Software
Application Through 2015

AO. Edge and Thakkar continued to develop, troubleshoot, and improve the custom
trading software application and communicate with Trader A in 2012 and 2013. During this
time, Trader A continued to communicate with Thakkar regarding his use of the Back-of-Book
function to place orders in the E-mini S&P that he intended to cancel before they resulted in
executed trades. For example, on October 24, 2012, Trader A complained to Thakkar that
automatic cancellation feature of the Back-of-Book function was not working properly: âIst
click cancel doesnât work on Join/Join Side â I have been hit numerous clips and the order
doesnât pull.ââ Thakkar agreed to perform additional programming work for Trader A to ensure

that this feature was operating as Trader A wanted. Thakkar himself tested the automatic

15
cancellation feature of the Back-of-Book function and told Trader A on November 19, 2012, that
he could not reproduce the issues Trader A had encountered.

Al, Alter February 2013, Thakkar and Edge remained available to help Trader A with
the operation and further development of the custom trading software application. In December
2014, Trader A told Thakkar that he had taken a six-month break from trading but now needed
help from Thakkar and Edge because the application had stopped working. At this time, Trader
A sought hetp from Thakkar and Edge to restore all the functions of the application, including
the Back-of-Book function. Thakkar and Edge agreed to continue to design and develop the
application to restore Trader Aâs ability to use ut, including the Back-of-Bock function. In
December 2014, Thakkar sent Trader A a new version of the application again that Thakkar
belheved fixed the problem identihed by Trader A. Trader A responded that it snl did not work
and that he was âgetting screwed here without the app.â

Ae. After receiving the new version of the custom trading software application from
Thakkar on December 14, 2014, Trader A continued to communicate to Thakkar his urgent
request for further design and development of the application, at one point saying âLreally need a
working version for this morning trading in the US, am used to having the app available and it is
costing me not having tt in these volatile markets.â Thakkar and Edge concluded that the
problems Trader A was encountering resulted from an mcompatibiity between the original
version of the application designed by Thakkar and Edge and subsequent updates to the trading
plattorm software Trader A used to access the Globex trading platform. Thakkar informed
Trader A that further developing the application so that Trader A could use it with the new
version of his trading platform software would require additional programming by Edge

employees.

16
43. At Trader Aâs request, Thakkar and Edge further designed and developed the

custom trading software application in December 2014 and January 2015 in order to provide
Trader A with working version of the application. Thakkar sent Trader A new versions of the
application on at least December 16, 2014 and January 5, 6, 9, and [5 of 2015. Trader A
continued to make additional requests to Thakkar and Edge for further modifications to the
application, emailing Thakkar after receiving another new version of the application on January
15, 2015, that âI really canât afford to be without the app when its [sic] this volatile.â Shortly
thereafter, upon information and belief, Thakkar sent the application again.

44, On or around March 30, 2015, Thakkar and Edge billed Trader A approximately
$4,000 dollars for approximately 35.5 hours of additional design and development work by
Thakkar and Edge in December 2014 and January 2015.

abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, or procured the commission of the acts constituting
violations of Section 4c(ay(3 )(C) of the Act committed by Trader A or acted in combination or

(2012), Edge and Thakkar are therefore responsible as if they were principals for Trader Aâs
violations of Section 4c(ay5)(C) of the Act from Tanuary 30, 2013, through October 30, 2013.

omission, or failure of any official, agent, or other person acting for any corporation within the
scope of his employment shall be deemed an act of the corporation. Because the actions of
Thakkar and the actions of other Edge employees who helped design and develop the Back-of-
Book function at Thakkarâs direction were within the scope of their employment with Edge,
Edge is lable for their acts constituting violations of the Act pursuant to Section 2(ai(i KB) of
the Act.

30, Thakkar controlled Edge, directly or indirectly, and did not act in good faith or
knowingly induced, directly or indirectly, the acts of Edge that constitute violations alleged in
this alleged in this Count; therefore, pursuant to Section 13(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ E3cth)

51. Each and every imstance between January 30, 2013, and October 30, 2013, that
Trader A placed Spoof Orders for the E-mini S&P using the Back-of-Book function constitutes a
separate and distinct violations of Section 4c(aySHC) of the Act for which Thakkar and Edge are

responsible as if they were principals under Section 13(a) of the Act.

<h1>CFTC Charges James Vorley and Cedric Chanu with Spoofing and Engaging in a Deceptive and Manipulative Scheme in the Precious Metals Futures Markets</h1>

<p><b>Washington, DC</b>Â â The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) announced the filing of a civil enforcement action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois againstÂ <b>James Vorley</b>, a U.K. resident, andÂ <b>Cedric Chanu</b>, a United Arab Emirates resident, charging them with spoofing and engaging in a manipulative and deceptive scheme in the precious metals futures markets.</p>

<p><b>CFTCâs Director of Enforcement Comments</b></p>

<p>James McDonald, the CFTCâs Director of Enforcement, commented: âSpoofing undermines the integrity of our markets and gives those engaging in the unlawful conduct an unfair advantage over law-abiding market participants. The CFTC is committed to identifying and prosecuting this type of misconduct. As this case shows, the CFTC will aggressively pursue not only companies but also individuals who engage in this type of misconduct in our markets.â</p>

<p>The CFTC Complaint alleges that beginning in at least May 2008 and continuing through at least July 2013, while employed at a large financial institution, Vorley and Chanu engaged in a manipulative and deceptive scheme while placing orders and trading in the precious metals futures markets on a registered entity.Â  Specifically, in furtherance of the scheme, Vorley and Chanu repeatedly engaged in manipulative or deceptive acts and practices by spoofing (bidding or offering with the intent to cancel the bid or offer before execution).Â  On numerous occasions, Vorley and/or Chanu placed orders for COMEX gold, silver, platinum or palladium futures contracts that they wanted to get filled (Genuine Order) and entered orders for the same contract on the opposite side of the market that they intended to cancel before execution (Spoof Order).Â  In placing these Spoof Orders, Defendants Vorley and Chanu intentionally or recklessly sent false signals of increased supply or demand to trick market participants into executing against the Genuine Orders Vorley and Chanu wanted to get filled. Vorley and Chanu also engaged in spoofing in coordination with other traders on the precious metals desk and taught another trader on the desk how to spoof.</p>

<p>In its continuing civil litigation, the CFTC seeks, among other relief, civil monetary penalties, disgorgement, and a permanent injunction against future violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC Regulations, as charged.</p>

<p>The CFTC thanks and acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the CME Group, and the UK Financial Conduct Authority.</p>

<p>This case is brought in connection with the CFTC Division of Enforcementâs Spoofing Task Force, and staff members responsible for this case are Katie Rasor, Brandon Wozniak, Alben Weinstein, Patryk J. Chudy, Lenel Hickson, Jr., and Manal M. Sultan.</p>

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS

 

 

EASTERN DIVISION
COMMODITY FUTURES
TRADING COMMISSION
Lo. CIVIL ACTION NO: 18-cv-00603

Plaintiff,
â Hon.
JAMES VORLEY and CEDRIC CHANU,

Defendants, JURY TRIAL DEMANDED

 

 

COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, CIVIL MONETARY
PENALTIES AND OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF

Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCFTCâ) alleges as follows:

I. SUMMARY

1. Beginning in at least May 2008 and continuing through at least July 2013 (the
âRelevant Periodâ), Defendants James Vorley (âVorleyâ) and Cedric Chanu (âChanuââ) engaged
in a manipulative and deceptive scheme (the âSchemeââ) while placing orders and trading in the
precious metals futures markets on a registered entity. Specifically, in furtherance of the
Scheme, Vorley and Chanu repeatedly engaged in manipulative or deceptive acts and practices
by âspoofingâ (bidding or offering with the intent to cancel the bid or offer before execution).
On numerous occasions, Vorley and/or Chanu placed orders for COMEX gold, silver, platinum
or palladium futures contracts that they wanted to get filled (the âGenuine Orderâ) and entered
orders for the same contract on the opposite side of the market that they intended to cancel

before execution (the âSpoof Orderâ). In placing these Spoof Orders, Defendants Vorley and
Chanu intentionally or recklessly sent false signals of increased supply or demand to trick market
participants into executing against the orders Vorley and Chanu wanted to get filled.

2. By virtue of this conduct, as further alleged herein, from approximately July 2011
through at least July 2013, Defendants Vorley and Chanu engaged in acts and practices that
violated Section 4c(a)(5)(C) of Commodity Exchange Act (âActâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6c(a)(5)(C)
(2012).

3. By virtue of this conduct, as further alleged herein, from approximately August
2011 through at least July 2013, Defendants Vorley and Chanu engaged in acts and practices that
violated Section 6(c)(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 9(1) (2012) and Commission Regulation
(âRegulationâ) 180.1(a)(1) and (3), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 180.1(a)(1), (3) (2017).

4. Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1
(2012), to enjoin Vorleyâs and Chanuâs violative acts and practices and to compel Vorleyâs and
Chanuâs compliance with the Act. In addition, Plaintiff seeks civil monetary penalties and such
other equitable relief, including but not limited to disgorgement, as this Court deems necessary
and appropriate.

If. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

5. This Court has jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1331 (federal
question jurisdiction) and 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1345, which provides that district courts have original
jurisdiction over civil actions commenced by the United States or by any agency expressly
authorized to sue by Act of Congress. Section 6c(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(a) (2012),
authorizes the Commission to seek injunctive relief against any person whenever it shall appear
to the Commission that such person has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in any act or
practice constituting a violations of any provision of the Act or any rule, regulation or order

thereunder.
Case: 1:18-cv-00603 Document #: 1 Filed: 01/26/18 Page 3 of 19 PagelD #:3

6. Venue properly lies with this Court, pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
Â§ 13a-1(e) (2012), because Vorley and Chanu transacted business in this District, or the acts and
practices in violations of the Act have occurred within this District. Venue is also proper pursuant
to 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1391(c)(3).

Hil. PARTIES

7. Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an independent federal
regulatory agency that is charged by Congress with the administration and enforcement of the
Act and Regulations promulgated thereunder.

8. Defendant James Vorley was employed by Bank A as a trader from at least 2008
to March 2015. For the duration of this time period, Vorley was employed as a trader on the
precious metals desk in London at Bank A. Vorley has never been registered with the
Commission. Vorley is a U.K. national domiciled in the U.K.

9. Defendant Cedric Chanu was employed by Bank A as a trader from at least
2008 to December 2013. From at least 2008 to May 2011, Chanu was employed as a trader on
the precious metals desk in London at Bank A. In May 2011, Chanu moved to the precious
metals desk in Singapore at Bank A, where he remained a trader until December 2013. Chanu

has never been registered with the Commission. Chanu is a French national domiciled in the

 

United Arab Emirates.
IV. FACTS
A. Market Fundamentals
10. A Futures Contract is an agreement to purchase or sell a commodity for delivery

or cash settlement in the future at a specified price. A futures contract traded on an exchange has

standard, non-negotiable contract specifications.
a a
. nN rder, in the context of electronic excnange trading, 1s a request submitte

to an exchange to buy (that is, âbidââ) or sell (that is, âofferâ or âaskââ) a certain number of a
specified futures contract. An order is for one or more contracts. Contracts may also be called
âlots,â among other things. Orders are entered into the exchangeâs Order Book. When one or
more contracts in an order are bought or sold, that is a âfillâ (or a âtradeâ or âexecutionâ). At
any time before the order is fully filled, the trader can âcancelâ the order. When an order is
cancelled, the contracts that have not yet been bought or sold are pulled from the Order Book.

12. An âIceberg Orderâ is a type of order that traders could place on an exchange. In
an Iceberg Order, the total amount of the order was divided into a visible portion of a certain pre-
set quantity that was visible to other market participants, and a portion of the order, 1.e. the
remainder of the order, that was not. Whenever the visible portion of the order was filled, the
same, pre-set quantity of the remaining, hidden portion automatically became visible; this
process repeated until the entire order was either executed or cancelled.

13. When a âbuyâ or âsellâ order is submitted to an exchangeâs electronic trading
system, the order becomes part of the Order Book. In the Order Book, each trader can view the
aggregate number of contracts that all traders are actively bidding or offering at a given price
level. The best-bid level, or first-bid level, is the highest price at which someone is willing to
buy. The best-ask level, or first-ask level, is the lowest price at which someone is willing to sell.
The bid-ask spread is the difference between those two prices.

14. Traders can view the aggregate contracts and orders up to the tenth-bid and tenth-
ask levels. This combined bid and ask information is often referred to as the visible order book
and represents the visible market depth. Traders often rely on information in the order book to

make trading decisions.
15. Order Book Balance refers to the numeric relationship between the number of
pending visible contracts offered and the number of pending visible contracts bid. Many market
participants rely on the information contained in the Order Book and consider it when making
trading decisions. For instance, if the aggregate size and number of sell orders significantly
outweighs the total aggregate size and number of buy orders, market participants may believe
that the Order Book Balance indicates that supply is exceeding demand and a price drop is
imminent. Accordingly, they may decide to place orders to sell.

16. Commodity Exchange, Inc. (ââCOMEXââ) is a futures exchange located in New
York, New York. COMEX is a designated contract market for trading futures and options under
the Act. COMEX is owned and operated by CME Group, Inc. (âCME Groupâ), which is
financial and commodity derivatives exchange based in Chicago, Illinois. CME Groupâs
COMEX lists for trading gold futures, silver futures and other precious metals contracts.

17. | New York Mercantile Exchange (âNYMEXâââ) is a futures exchange located in
New York, New York. NYMEX is a designated contract market for trading futures and options
under the Act. NYMEX is owned and operated by CME Group. NYMEX lists for trading in
platinum futures, palladium futures and other precious metals contracts.

18. Globex is CMEâs electronic trading system, located in the Northern District of
Illinois.

19. COMEX Gold Contract is regularly traded on Globex for delivery during the
current calendar month, the next two calendar months, any February, April, August, and October
falling within a 23-month period, and any June and December falling within a 72-month period
beginning with the current month. One contract unit is equal to 100 troy ounces. The COMEX

Gold Contract is generally referred to herein as âGold Futures.â

20. COMEX Silver Contract is regularly traded on Globex for delivery during the
current calendar month, the next two calendar months, any January, March, May, and September
falling within a 23-month period, and any July and December falling within a 60-month period
beginning with the current month. One contract unit is equal to 5,000 troy ounces. The COMEX
Silver Contract is generally referred to herein as âSilver Futures.â

21. NYMEX Platinum Contract is regularly traded on Globex for delivery during
the current calendar month, the next two calendar months, and any March, June, September, and
December within a 15-month period beginning with the current month. One contract unit is
equal to 50 troy ounces. The NYMEX Platinum Contract is generally referred to herein as
âPlatinum Futures.â

22. NYMEX Palladium Contract is regularly traded on Globex for delivery during
the current calendar month, the next two calendar months, and any March, June, September, and
December falling within a 15-month period beginning with the current month. One contract unit
is equal to 100 troy ounces. The NYMEX Palladium Contract is generally referred to herein as
âPalladium Futures.â

23. Tick refers to the minimum price fluctuation for a particular futures contract. The
minimum price fluctuation for Gold Futures is $.10 per troy ounce. The minimum price
fluctuation for Silver Futures is $.005 per troy ounce.

24. Globexâs matching algorithm applies a First-In-First-Out (âFIFOââ) principle to
orders at the same level of the Order Book. For example, if there are multiple orders sitting at
the level of the best bid, and an offer is then placed at that same level, the bids will be filled in
the order that they were placed. Modifications to price or quantity will move the order to the

back of the queue.

B. Vorley And Chanu Engaged In A Manipulative And Deceptive Scheme By Spoofing,
And Taught A Subordinate How To Spoof

25. During the Relevant Period, Bank A, together with its subsidiaries and affiliates,
was one of the largest global banking and financial services companies in the world. Bank A had
operations in the United States and around the world. Bank A operated a global commodities
trading business that included the trading of precious metals futures contracts. Bank Aâs primary
precious metals futures trading desks were located in Singapore, London and New York.

26. During the Relevant Period, Vorley and Chanu engaged in the Scheme, which
followed the general pattern set forth herein. Vorley and Chanu, both individually and in
coordination with each other and other traders at Bank A, manually placed Spoof Orders for
precious metals futures contracts with the CME through Globex, which they intended to cancel
before execution, opposite Genuine Orders for precious metals futures contracts, which they
desired to execute. Typically, the Genuine Orders were Iceberg Orders and the Spoof Orders
were not. For example, Vorley and Chanu would enter Genuine Orders as Iceberg Orders with
small quantities visible to the market, and within a short time thereafter, placed visibly larger
Spoof Orders on the other side of the Order Book. Vorleyâs and Chanuâs Spoof Orders were
often placed within 5 ticks behind the best price so as to reduce the likelihood of them being
filled. The Spoof Orders also were typically at least 10 lots, and were often placed and cancelled
within a 5 second window.

27. Vorley and Chanu intended to cancel the Spoof Orders before execution, and
often did so after their Genuine Orders were filled.

28. Vorley and Chanuâs Scheme involved sending false signals to the market that they
wanted to buy or sell the number of contracts in their Spoof Orders. In reality, Vorley and

Chanu did not want their Spoof Orders to execute; rather, at the time they placed the Spoof

Orders, Vorley and Chanu intended to cancel them before execution. Vorley and Chanu used the
Spoof Orders as a means of tricking other market participants into executing against their
Genuine Orders.

29. Vorley and Chanuâs Scheme was designed to benefit financially from market
participantsâ reactions to their Spoof Orders. The following is a simplified explanation of how
their Scheme was intended to work, using a hypothetical example of a Spoof Order on the buy
side. A large Spoof Order to buy would result in an increase in demand in the order book (i.e.,
create or add to an order book imbalance in which orders to buy outweigh orders to sell). This
increase would be visible to other market participants and may lead them to conclude that the
price is likely to rise. This conclusion, in turn, would impact market participantsâ decisions,
including prompting some to attempt to purchase contracts before the predicted rise in price
happens. In such a case, these participants would place aggressive orders to buy (.e., at a higher
price than the currently resting bids in the market), making execution of orders resting on the
opposite side of the Spoof Order more likely. Finally, these bids would enable orders on the
opposite side of the Spoof Orderâincluding Vorley and Chanuâs Genuine Ordersâto sell
sooner, at a better price, or in larger quantities than they otherwise would.

30. By engaging in the Scheme as described herein, Vorley entered Spoof Orders to
intentionally send a false signal to the market that he actually wanted to buy or sell the number of
contracts specified in the Spoof Orders, or did so while recklessly disregarding the fact that
entering his Spoof Orders would send such a false signalâa signal that injected false
information about supply and demand into the market that could affect market activity. Vorley
engaged in this Scheme to trick other market participants into executing against his or his

colleaguesâ Genuine Orders on the opposite side of the marketâallowing them to fill sooner, at a

better price, or in larger quantities than they otherwise would. Vorley knew or recklessly
disregarded that the Spoof Orders would create the false appearance of market depth and result
in misinformation, thereby luring market participants to trade based on Vorleyâs spoofing. The
risk that the Spoof Orders could mislead other market participants into believing there was
genuine interest in purchasing or selling the specified number of contracts represented by
Vorleyâs Spoof Orders was so obvious that Vorley must have been aware of it. He knew that his
Spoof Orders would appear in the Order Book and that traders often consider order-book
information in making trading decisions; thus, Vorley was, at least, reckless with respect to the
danger that his Spoof Orders would mislead other market participants.

31. By engaging in the Scheme as described herein, Chanu entered Spoof Orders to
intentionally send a false signal to the market that he actually wanted to buy or sell the number of
contracts specified in the Spoof Orders, or did so while recklessly disregarding the fact that
entering his Spoof Orders would send such a false signalâa signal that injected false
information about supply and demand into the market that could affect market activity. Chanu
engaged in this Scheme to trick other market participants into executing against his or his
colleaguesâ Genuine Orders on the opposite side of the marketâallowing them to fill sooner, at a
better price, or in larger quantities than they otherwise would. Chanu knew or recklessly
disregarded that the Spoof Orders would create the false appearance of market depth and result
in misinformation, thereby luring market participants to trade based on Chanuâs spoofing. The
risk that the Spoof Orders could mislead other market participants into believing there was
genuine interest in purchasing or selling the specified number of contracts represented by
Chanuâs Spoof Orders was so obvious that Chanu must have been aware of it. He knew that his

Spoof Orders would appear in the Order Book and that traders often consider order-book
Case: 1:18-cv-00603 Document #: 1 Filed: 01/26/18 Page 10 of 19 PagelD #:10

information in making trading decisions; thus, Chanu was, at least, reckless with respect to the
danger that his Spoof Orders would mislead other market participants.

32. In or about July 2009, Bank A hired Trader A onto Bank Aâs precious metals
trading desk in Singapore. Trader A remained a trader on the desk until approximately February
2012. Over his several months on the desk, Trader A observed Vorley and Chanuâs trading.â
Specifically, Trader A observed Vorley and Chanu spoof. According to Trader A, the trading
patterns described above in paragraph 26 were consistent with spoofing.

33. Trader A explained the Scheme in an electronic chat with Trader B, a trader at
another financial institution, Bank B, on March 28, 2011. At approximately 10:54 p.m. Trader
A said: âbasically 1 sold out... just by having fake bids . . . [in] the futures . . . 1 just spam bids
below ...to clear my offer.â The âfake bidsâ and âspam bidsâ that Trader A referred to were
Spoof Orders. Shortly before making those statements, Trader A placed a Genuine Order as an
Iceberg Order to sell at 10:43:34 p.m. in Silver Futures for 20 lots, with | lot as the visible
quantity. After that order failed to continue filling for 2 minutes and 30 seconds, Trader A began
quickly placing and cancelling a series of 21 Spoof Orders to buy for a total of 220 lots in order
to get his sell order filled. The Spoof Orders were typically cancelled within | or 2 seconds. At
10:54:12 p.m. Trader A filled the 20"" contract of his original sell order and cancelled the
remaining Spoof Orders.

34. During the period that Vorley and Chanu were teaching Trader A how to spoof,
Vorley and Chanu frequently spoofed. For example, on March 16, 2011, Vorley wrote to

another trader at Bank A that he was âspoofing it up... ahem ahem.â On that day, Vorley was

 

1 The bankâs trading technology enabled traders on the precious metals desk to see each otherâs
trading activity in real time across all three desk locations.
2 Unless otherwise noted, times referenced are in the Central time zone.

10
attempting to fill a 56-lot Genuine Order as an Iceberg Order to sell with | lot showing in Gold
Futures. Immediately after placing the 56-lot sell order at 6:03:21 a.m., Vorley placed 12 buy
Spoof Orders over the following 5 seconds each for 10 lots, for a total of 120 lots that were
subsequently cancelled within | to 2 seconds each. The Genuine Order continued to fill during
and after the cancellation of the Spoof Orders.

35. In addition to placing Spoof Orders to get their own Genuine Orders filled, as part
of their Scheme, Vorley and Chanu also placed Spoof Orders to help fill Genuine Orders placed
by each other as well as by other traders at Bank A, including Trader A. At other times, Trader
A would place Spoof Orders to help Vorley, Chanu or other traders at Bank A get their Genuine
Orders filled. This frequently happened when one of the traders would notice that a colleagueâs
Genuine Order had âstalled,â 1.e., failed to fully fill shortly after being placed. When that
happened, Vorley, Chanu, Trader A or other traders on the desk would âhelpâ their colleague by
placing Spoof Orders opposite the stalled Genuine Order to create the false appearance of market
depth and book pressure and result in misinformation designed to induce a market participant to
fill the Genuine Order when that market participant otherwise might not have done so.

36. Chanu discussed the Scheme with another trader on the desk at Bank A, Trader C,
in an electronic chat dated January 28, 2009. Shortly after Trader C placed Spoof Orders to help
Chanu attempt to fill his Genuine Order, Trader C said to Chanu âso glad i could help... got
that up 2 bucks .. . hahahahah.â He continued: âthat does show u how easy it is to manipulate
so[me]times.ââ Chanu replied âyeah yeah of course.â Trader C continued: âthat was alot of
clicking,â referring to the process of placing a series of Spoof Orders and quickly cancelling
them. Chanu replied: âbasically you tricked alkll [sic] the algorythm,â referring to the fact that

Trader Câs Spoof Orders had sent a false signal to the market and deceived other market

11
participants into transacting based on the false information, thereby allowing Chanu to obtain a
favorable execution of the Genuine Order. Trader C stated â1 know how to âgameâ this stuffâ
and Chanu replied âTHAT IS BRILLIANT.â Trader C continued: â[I] f..k the mkt around a lot
... not alot of people had it figgied out . . . that[â]s why 1 love electronic trading.â

37. In another example, on November 3, 2010, Trader A was attempting to sell 400
Gold Futures contracts but was not getting all of his Genuine Order (placed as an Iceberg Order)
filled, even after dropping the price. Seeing that Trader A needed a fill, Vorley and Chanu
placed a series of Spoof Orders to buy that they then cancelled after approximately two seconds
each, in an effort to help Trader A fill his Genuine Order. Specifically, Vorley submitted and
cancelled 29 buy orders at 10 contracts each. Following this activity, Trader A writes in an
electronic chat to Vorley âclassic jam it... tricks from the master.â

38. Vorley, Chanu and the other traders on the desk continued their Scheme into
2012. For example, on January 6, 2012 at 1:59:04.221, Trader A placed a 20 lot, Gold Futures
Genuine Order to sell as an Iceberg Order with 1 lot visible to the market. The Genuine Order
executed 13 lots after approximately 6 seconds, but then stalled. After stalling for approximately
8 seconds, Chanu placed 9 Spoof Orders to buy starting at 1:59:18.668, 8 for 10 lots and one for
50 lots, for a total of 130 lots. Chanu cancelled all of these orders in less than 5 seconds. One
second after Chanu finished cancelling all of his Spoof Orders, Trader A received a 1-lot fill on
his Genuine Order.

39. On June 6, 2012 at 1:26:57.520, Vorley placed a 30 lot, Gold Futures Genuine
Order to sell as an Iceberg Order with 1 lot visible to the market. The order immediately
executed 20 lots, however, it stalled for almost 12 seconds. Chanu then placed 8 Spoof Orders to

buy, 10 lots each, for a total of 80 lots starting at 1:27:09.320 in order to spoof the market.

12
Case: 1:18-cv-00603 Document #: 1 Filed: 01/26/18 Page 13 of 19 PagelD #:13

While most of the Spoof Orders were pending, 8 additional lots of Vorleyâs Genuine Offer
executed. Chanu placed and cancelled each of the Spoof Orders within 5 seconds. Shortly after
Chanu finished cancelling his Spoof Orders, Vorleyâs remaining 2 lots of his Genuine Order
executed so that he was fully filled.

C. Vorley And Chanu Continued Their Manipulative and Deceptive Scheme Through
2013

I. January 28, 2013 Spoofing

AO. Vorley and Chanu continued their Scheme into 2013. For example, on January
28, 2013, at approximately 15:32:43.198, Vorley placed a 34-lot Genuine Order as an Iceberg
Order to show 1 lot to the market, to buy Gold Futures at $1655.20.

Al. After approximately 30 seconds during which the Genuine Order did not fill, at
15:33:12.415, Vorley placed a 110-lot Spoof Order, to sell Gold Futures at $1655.70 that he
intended to cancel before execution. The 110-lot order was placed 3 ticks away from the best
offer at the time of placement.

42. Before the Spoof Order was placed, the market was relatively balanced, with 13%
more offers than bids. As a result of the Spoof Order, the market became one where there were
96% more offers than bids.

43. Approximately | second after the Spoof Order to sell was placed, the Genuine
Order to buy begins to fill rapidly, | lot at a time, until all 34 lots fill over the course of a few
milliseconds.

44. Approximately 1.6 seconds after the last lot of the Genuine Order filled, Vorley
cancelled the 110-lot Spoof Order to sell in its entirety. That Spoof Order was on the market for

an overall time of just under 3 seconds.

45. On May 23, 2013, at 1:05:45.122, Chanu placed a 96-lot Genuine Order that was
an Iceberg Order showing 1 lot to the market to buy June delivery Gold Futures at $1374.10. At
the time, $1374.10 was 5 ticks off of the best bid in the market.

46. The Genuine Order continued to sit unfilled and then at 01:07:55.630, Chanu
placed a 100-lot Spoof Order 2 ticks away from the best offer to sell June delivery Gold Futures
at $1374.60, which he intended to cancel before execution.

47. Just before placing the 100-lot Spoof Order, the visible volume on the offer side
was 62 contracts with no price level exceeding 15 contracts. Chanuâs 100-lot offer more than
doubled the visible volume on the offer side and almost doubled the visible bid volume.

A8. Chanuâs 1-lot Genuine Order to buy at $1374.10 was filled approximately 1.2
seconds after the placement of his 100-lot Spoof Order to sell, after pending in the market for
over 2 minutes.

49. At 01:07:57.865, a half second after filling his Genuine Order, Chanu cancelled
his 100-lot Spoof Order in its entirety.

3. June 2, 2013 Spoofing

50. On June 2, 2013, at 19:52:13.056, Chanu placed a 50-lot Genuine Order that was
an Iceberg Order showing 1 lot to the market to sell August-delivery Gold Futures at $1395.60.
At the time of placement, the Genuine Order was at the best price level.

51. The Genuine Order sat pending for over 3 minutes, at which point Chanu placed a
100-lot Spoof Order to buy August-delivery Gold Futures at $1395.3 that he intended to cancel

before execution.

52. At the time of placement, the Spoof Order to buy was | tick away from the best
bid.

53. At the time Chanu placed the 100-lot Spoof Order, the total visible buy-side order
volume was 116 lots. His Spoof Order, therefore, increased the visible sell-side volume by
almost 50%.

54. Almost immediately, Chanuâs Genuine Order filled 3 contracts.

55. Approximately | second later, Chanu cancelled his 100-lot Spoof Order in its
entirety.

4. July 9, 2013 Spoofing

56. On July 9, 2013, at 15:51:59.661, Vorley placed a 50-lot Genuine Order as an
Iceberg Order showing | lot to the market, to sell Gold Futures at $1247.00.

57. Almost immediately, 10 lots of the sell order filled. Then approximately 5
seconds passed without further fills, so Vorley placed a 100-lot Spoof Order to buy Gold Futures
at $1246.80 that he intended to cancel before execution.

58. At the time the Spoof Order was placed, the market was slightly imbalanced, with
58% more bids than offers. As a result of the Spoof Order, the market became one where the
Order Book had 207% more bids than offers.

59. Almost immediately after the Spoof Order to buy was placed, within 3
milliseconds, 8 additional lots filled from the Genuine Order.

60. Less than a second after the 8"" lot of the Genuine Order to sell was filled, Vorley
cancelled the 100-lot Spoof Order to buy in its entirety. The Spoof Order was on the market for

approximately 7 tenths of a second.

<h1>CFTC Orders Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. to Pay $70 Million Penalty for Attempted Manipulation of U.S. Dollar ISDAFIX Benchmark Swap Rates</h1>

<p><b>Washington, DC</b>Â â The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today issued an Order filing and settling charges againstÂ <b>Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.</b>Â (DBSI) for attempted manipulation of the ISDAFIX benchmark and requiring DBSI to pay a $70 million civil monetary penalty.</p>

<p>The CFTC Order finds that over a five-year period, beginning in at least January 2007 and continuing through May 2012 (the Relevant Period), DBSI made false reports and through the acts of multiple traders attempted to manipulate the U.S. Dollar International Swaps and Derivatives Association Fix (USD ISDAFIX), a leading global benchmark referenced in a range of interest rate products, to benefit its derivatives positions, including positions involving cash-settled options on interest rate swaps.</p>

<p><b>CFTCâs Enforcement Director Comments</b></p>

<p>James McDonald, CFTC Director of Enforcement, commented: âThis action reflects the CFTCâs continued and vigilant commitment to protect those who rely on the integrity of critical financial benchmarks. There is no room in our markets for manipulationâwe will continue to work hard to stamp it out, wherever we find it.â</p>

<p>During the Relevant Period, USD ISDAFIX was set each day in a process that began at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time with the capture and recording of swap rates and spreads from a U.S. based unit of a leading interest rate swaps broking firm (âSwaps Brokerâ).Â </p>

<p>ISDAFIX rates and spreads are published daily and are meant to indicate the prevailing mid-market rate, at a specific time of day, for the fixed leg of a standard fixed-for-floating interest rate swap.Â  They are issued in several currencies and are published for various maturities of U.S. Dollar-denominated swaps.Â  The most widely used USD ISDAFIX rates and spreads, and the ones at issue in this Order, are those that are intended to indicate the prevailing market rate as of 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time. The 11:00 a.m. USD ISDAFIX rate is used for the cash settlement of options on interest rate swaps, or swaptions, and as a valuation tool for certain other interest rate products.</p>

<p>The Order finds that certain DBSI options and/or swaps traders understood and employed two primary means in their attempts to manipulate USD ISDAFIX rates: trading attempted manipulation and submission attempted manipulation.Â </p>

<p><b>Trading Attempted Manipulation</b></p>

<p>According to the Order, DBSI attempted to manipulate the USD ISDAFIX by bidding, offering, and executing transactions in targeted interest rate products, including swap spreads and U.S. Treasuries at or near the critical 11:00 a.m. fixing time to affect rates on the electronic interest rate swap screen known as the â19901 screenâ and thereby increase or decrease the Swaps Brokerâs reference rates and influence the final published USD ISDAFIX.Â  As evidenced in recorded calls and electronic communications, DBSI traders talked about âpushingâ or âmovingâÂ  the fix, or âgetting the printâ at a price, to benefit DBSIâs positions.</p>

<p>In order to effect these goalsâthrough communications involving multiple DBSI traders, on more than one DBSI trading desk, spanning several yearsâDBSI Swap traders would tell the Swaps Broker their need for a certain swap level at 11:00 a.m. or their need to have the level moved up or down.Â  On at least one occasion, the Swaps Broker expressed the need to know how much âammoâ certain DBSI traders had to use in order to move the screen at 11:00 a.m.</p>

<p>On February 28, 2007, for example, the Swaps Broker told a DBSI Swaps trader: âI had to do what I had to do to keep âem down, rightâ¦We got the printâ¦50 is not going to hold it.âÂ  As this conversation demonstrates, the Swaps Broker fully understood that the DBSI trader wanted to keep the price down and get the print that would benefit DBSIâs position.</p>

<p><b>DBSI Traders Knew Their Conduct Was Illegal</b></p>

<p>The Order finds, further, that DBSI traders knew their conduct in attempting to manipulate the USD ISDAFIX was illegal. On one occasion, when a DBSI Swaps trader stated to a broker, âI really have no desire to ever trade equities. Itâs just a field day for the feds,â the broker responded: âthis will be over soon as well and if they ever figured out exactly how pricing happened through [the Swaps Broker] on a daily basis a lot ofÂ  people would actually do jail time.âÂ </p>

<p><b>Submission Attempted Manipulation</b></p>

<p>The Order also finds that on certain days in which DBSI had a trading position settling or resetting against the USD ISDAFIX, certain DBSI Swaps Desk employees responsible for making USD ISDAFIX submissions (the âSubmitterâ or âSubmittersâ) attempted to manipulate the final published USD ISDAFIX rates by submitting rates that were false, misleading, or knowingly inaccurate because they purported to reflect DBSIâs honest view of the true costs of entering into an interest rate swap in particular tenors, but in fact reflected tradersâ desire to move USD ISDAFIX higher or lower in order to benefit DBSIâs positions.Â  Submitters made false submissions for DBSI by skewing the rates and spreads submitted to the Swaps Broker in the direction that could have moved the USD ISDAFIX setting to benefit DBSIâs trading positions.Â </p>

<p>DBSI memorialized its manipulative submissions conduct in a Swap Desk Guide, authored by a Submitter, which stated that: âSwap dealer desks submit 11 a.m. levels of rate and spreads for option striking purposes.Â  The options desk may ask for specific levels.âÂ  The then-Head of the Swaps Desk at DBSI understood that if an Options trader asked the Swaps Desk for specific levels and the Submitter complied with that request, that would be wrong because that would be âfixing the rate.âÂ </p>

<p>*Â  *Â  *Â  *Â  *Â  *</p>

<p>DBSI has taken specified steps to implement and strengthen its internal controls and procedures relating to the fixing of interest-rate swaps benchmarks, including measures to detect and deter trading or other conduct potentially intended to manipulate directly or indirectly swap rates, including benchmarks based on interest-rate swaps and to ensure the integrity of the fixing of any interest-rate swap benchmark.</p>

<p>In the Order, the Commission advised that, under the circumstances, disqualification from making certain offerings should not arise under Rule 262(a) of Regulation A and Rule 506(d)(1) of Regulation D of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§Â 230.262(a), 230.506(d)(1) (2017), as a consequence of the Order.Â  In offering this advice, the Commission considered factors similar to those used by the SEC when it considers waivers of disqualification under Regulation A and Regulation D, as well as the previous waivers granted by the CFTC and the SEC in prior CFTC actions.Â  Finally, the Commissionâs advice is consistent with the guidance provided by the SEC in connection with its issuance of Rule 506, which states that the provision âunder which disqualification does not apply if the regulator issuing the relevant order determines that Rule 506 disqualification is not necessary under the circumstances, strikes an appropriate balance,â because â[i]t allows the relevant authorities to determine the impact of their orders and conserves [SEC] Commission resources (which might otherwise be devoted to consideration of waiver applications) in cases where the relevant authority determines that disqualification from Rule 506 offerings is not warranted.âÂ  Disqualification of Felons and Other âBad Actorsâ From Rule 506 Offerings, 78 FR 44730, 44748 (July 24, 2013, effective Sept. 23, 2013).Â  The CFTC is committed to working together with the SEC on these issues of mutual concern.</p>

<p>In accepting the Bankâs offer, the Commission recognizes DBSIâs cooperation with the Division of Enforcementâs investigation in this matter. The Commission recognizes that DBSI provided important information to the Division that helped the Division undertake its investigation efficiently and effectively.Â  The Commission also recognizes that DBSI commenced significant remedial action to strengthen the internal controls and policies relating to all benchmarks, including ISDAFIX.Â </p>

<p>The CFTC thanks and acknowledges the assistance of the UK Financial Conduct Authority and the Newark, New Jersey, Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation for their assistance in this matter.</p>

<p>The following staff members assisted in this case: Candice Aloisi, Jason Fairbanks, Jordon Grimm, David MacGregor, Mark A. Picard, David C. Newman, K. Brent Tomer and James Wheaton.</p>

<p>CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Janine M. Gargiulo, Trevor Kokal, Steven I. Ringer, Lenel Hickson, Jr., and Manal M. Sultan.</p>

Il.

The Commission finds the following:

A. Summary

Beginning at least as early as January 2007 and continuing through May 2012 (the
âRelevant Periodâ), DBSI, by and through certain of its traders, attempted to manipulate the U.S.
Dollar International Swaps and Derivatives Association Fix (ââUSD ISDAFIX,â âISDAFIX,â or
the âbenchmarkââ), a leading global benchmark referenced in a range of interest rate products, to
benefit its derivatives positions, including positions involving cash-settled options on interest
rate swaps.

ISDAFIX rates and spreads are published daily and are meant to indicate the prevailing
mid-market rate, at a specific time of day, for the fixed leg of a standard fixed-for-floating
interest rate swap.â They are issued in several currencies. USD ISDAFIX rates and spreads are
published for various maturities of U.S. Dollar-denominated swaps, including l-year to 10-years,
15-years, 20-years, and 30-years. The most widely used USD ISDAFIX rates and spreads, and
the ones at issue in this Order, are those that are intended to indicate the prevailing market rate as
of 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time. The 11:00 a.m. USD ISDAFIX rate is used for the cash settlement
of options on interest rate swaps, or swaptions, and as a valuation tool for certain other interest
rate products.

During the Relevant Period, USD ISDAFIX was set each day in a process that began at
11:00 a.m. Eastern Time with the capture and recording of swap rates and spreads from a U.S.
based unit of a leading interest rate swaps broking firm (âSwaps Brokerâ). Swaps Broker
disseminated rates and spreads captured in this snapshot as references to a panel of banks. This
reference point taken at 11:00 was sometimes referred to as the âfixâ or âprintâ by traders and
brokers. These reference rates and spreads (which were calculated using swap spread trade data
from Swaps Broker, U.S. Treasuries electronic trade data from Swaps Broker, and Eurodollar
futures data at or around 11:00 a.m.) were disseminated by Swaps Broker to the panel banks.
The panel banks then made submissions to Swaps Broker. Each bankâs submission was
supposed to reflect the midpoint of where that dealer would itself offer and bid a swap to a dealer
of good credit as of 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time. Most banks on the panel, including DBSI, usually
submitted Swaps Brokerâs reference rates and spreads as captured in the snapshot. As a result,
after an averaging of the submissions, the reference rates and spreads became the published USD
ISDAFIX almost every day.

However, on certain days in which DBSI had a trading position settling or resetting
against the USD ISDAFIX, DBSI attempted to manipulate USD ISDAFIX by making false
submissions for DBSI as a panel bank to Swaps Broker, skewing the rates and spreads submitted
in the direction that could have moved the USD ISDAFIX setting to benefit the Bankâs trading
positions. A bankâs derivatives trading positions or profitability are not legitimate or permissible
factors on which to base submissions in connection with a benchmark. Yet on multiple
occasions during the Relevant Period, certain DBSI traders caused DBSI to make USD ISDAFIX

 

Tn 2014, the administration of ISDAFIX changed, and a new version of the benchmark is published under a
different name by a new administrator using a different methodology.

submissions higher or lower for the purpose of benefitting positions priced or valued against the
benchmark, including swaption and other option positions. On these occasions, DBSIâs USD
ISDAFIX submissions constituted false, misleading, or knowingly inaccurate reports because
they purported to reflect DBSIâs honest view of the true costs of entering into a standard fixed-
for-floating interest rate swap in particular tenors, but in fact reflected tradersâ desire to move
USD ISDAFIX higher or lower in order to benefit DBSIâs positions. These submissions were
false, misleading, or knowingly inaccurate because they did not report where DBSI would itself
bid or offer interest rate swaps to a dealer of good credit absent a desire to manipulate USD
ISDAFIX, but rather reflected prices that were more favorable to the Bank on specific positions.

In addition to making false submissions, DBSI attempted to manipulate the USD
ISDAFIX by bidding, offering, and executing transactions in targeted interest rate products,
including swap spreads and U.S. Treasuries at or near the critical 11:00 a.m. fixing time, with the
intent to affect the reference rates and spreads captured by Swaps Broker that Swaps Broker
disseminated to submitting banks, and thereby to affect the published USD ISDAFIX.
Communications of this type involved multiple DBSI traders on more than one DBSI trading
desk and spanned several years.

During the Relevant Period, the Bank had inadequate controls and procedures in place
related to the submission process and trading around the 11:00 a.m. fixing. Because of the lack
of these controls and procedures, DBSIâs traders and DBSI submitters (âSubmittersâ) freely and
repeatedly engaged in attempts to manipulate the USD ISDAFIX, which the Bank failed to
detect and/or deter. For example, when an attempted manipulation was brought to the attention
of supervisors at the Bank overseeing the submission process, no corrective or remedial action
was taken.

In accepting the Bank's offer, the Commission recognizes Respondentâs cooperation with
the Division of Enforcementâs (the âDivisionââ) investigation in this matter. The Commission
recognizes that DBSI provided important information to the Division that helped the Division
undertake its investigation efficiently and effectively. The Commission also recognizes that
DBSI commenced significant remedial action to strengthen the internal controls and policies
relating to all benchmarks, including ISDAFIX. Accordingly, the civil monetary penalty
imposed on DBSI reflects the level of cooperation DBSI provided during the course of its
investigation.

C. Facts
1. USD ISDAFIX Setting

ISDAFIX rates and spreads are benchmarks that indicate prevailing market rates for
âplain vanillaâ interest rate swaps.â The 11:00 a.m. USD ISDAFIX was set during the Relevant
Period using a combination of swap spread trade data from Swaps Broker,â U.S. Treasuries
electronic trade data from Swaps Broker, Eurodollar futures, and submissions from a panel of
swap dealer banks, including DBSI.

The Swaps Brokerâs medium-term USD swaps desk (âMTS Deskââ) functioned much like
a traditional futures trading pit. Brokers on the desk sat (or stood) together and each serviced a
number of major swap dealer banks, to whom they were connected throughout the trading day by
direct phone lines and speaker boxes. The brokers communicated their clientsâ bids and offers
by open outcry to the entire MTS Desk and all of the brokers simultaneously. Any client could
accept a bid or offer. Once a broker confirmed that a client was âhittingâ a bid, âliftingâ an offer,
or was otherwise âdoneâ in a designated notional amount (either a minimum default amount or a
greater amount), the trade between the counterparties was executed and the counterparties
received a confirmation of the trade.

The Swaps Broker published a live feed of transaction data for USD interest rate swap
spreads, swap rates, and U.S. Treasury yields and prices to an electronic screen, known as the
â19901 screen,â accessible through a subscription-based market news service. The 19901 screen
reflected the levels at which those products were trading through the MTS Desk (for swap
spreads and swap rates) and the Swaps Brokerâs proprietary electronic bond trading platform (for
U.S. Treasuries). The levels displayed on the 19901 screen for swap spreads were manually
controlled by an employee of the Swaps Broker, known colloquially as the âscreen guyâ or
âscreen operator,â who would toggle the levels up or down based on the swap spread trading
activity that occurred before him on the MTS Desk. The 19901 screen is a reference used widely
throughout the financial industry by swap dealer banks, hedge funds, asset managers, businesses,
and other participants in interest rate markets. During the Relevant Period, levels displayed on
the 19901 screen at precisely 11:00 a.m. were critical because they were used to set USD
ISDAFIX.

 

* The term âswapâ is defined in Section 1a(47) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1a(47) (2012). An interest rate swap is
generally an exchange of fixed payments for floating payments, wherein one party to a swap pays a fixed rate on a
set notional amount (the party who âpays fixedâ is said to have âboughtâ the swap, or is âlongâ the swap) and the
other party pays a floating rate generally tied to three-month LIBOR (the party who âreceives fixedâ is said to have
âsoldâ the swap, or is âshortâ the swap). The âmaturityâ or âtenorâ of a swap refers to the number of years over
which counterparties exchange payments.

* An interest rate swap spread trade consists of a fixed-for-floating interest rate swap and an offsetting trade in U.S.
Treasuries of the same tenor, which allows a party to hedge part of the interest rate risk associated with the fixed-
for-floating swap. The difference in basis points between the U.S. Treasury yield and the swap rate constitutes the
âspreadâ quoted in a spread trade. The party who âreceives fixedâ in a swap and sells U.S. Treasuries to hedge is
âshortâ spreads or has âsoldâ spreads, while a party who âpays fixedâ in a swap and buys Treasuries to hedge is
âlongâ spreads or has âboughtâ spreads.
To set USD ISDAFIX rates for the 2-year through 30-year maturities, the Swaps Broker
first generated reference rates and spreads from the snapshot of 11:00 a.m. screen prices,
reflecting either the last traded spread or the mid-point between the most recent executable bid
and offer. The Swaps Brokerâs reference rates, for all maturities except the 1-year, were the sum
of the reference spread and the 19901 screenâs U.S. Treasury yield in the corresponding
maturity. To generate the l-year reference rate (for which there was no associated swap spread),
the Swaps Broker utilized a combination of Eurodollar futures yields (based on trading on
CMEâs Globex platform) and broker âsentiment,â which was intended to reflect prevailing rates
for 1-year swaps based on trading though the Swaps Brokerâs short-term swaps desk.

Minutes after the 11:00 a.m. snapshot of the 19901 was taken, the Swaps Broker
distributed its reference rates and spreads to a panel of fourteen or more contributing banks,
which either accepted and submitted the reference rates and spreads as their own or submitted
adjusted levels. Each bank, including DBSI, was expected to submit âthe mean of where that
dealer would itself offer and bid a swap in the relevant maturity for a notional equivalent amount
of US $50 million or whatever amount is deemed market size in that currency for that tenor to an
acknowledged dealer of good credit in the swap market.ââ Banks could change the prices for all
rates and spreads across all maturities in their submissions, or change any subset, including any
single rate or spread. Alternatively, a panel bank could make no submission at all. After a
quorum of contributing banks made their submissions, a calculation agent eliminated the highest
and lowest submissions (known as âtopping and tailingâ) and averaged the remaining
submissions. The submission and calculation process was generally completed in the half hour
following 11:00 a.m., after which the results were accessible to the public through a
subscription-based news service.

In practice, most panel banks, often including DBSI, accepted the Swaps Brokerâs
reference rates and spreads as their default submissions. Thus after âtopping and tailing,â the
Swaps Brokerâs reference rates and spreads usually became the final published USD ISDAFIX
benchmarks. However, as noted below, on multiple occasions during the Relevant Period, DBSI
submitted a rate or spread higher or lower than Swaps Brokerâs reference rates or spreads or
traded at 11:00 a.m. on certain days that DBSI had a derivatives position settling or resetting
against USD ISDAFIX in an attempt to benefit that derivatives position.

2. DBSIâs Role in USD ISDAFIX Setting

Throughout the Relevant Period, DBSI was one of the panel banks that submitted rates
and spreads for the determination of USD ISDAFIX. DBSIâs Interest Rates Swaps Desk
(âSwaps Deskâ) employees made DBSIâs daily USD ISDAFIX submissions. The Swaps Desk
was a market-making desk that traded, among other products, fixed-for-floating interest rate
swaps. The Swaps Desk acted as counterparty to external clients as well as internal DBSI desks
in a variety of interest rate swap transactions. Other DBSI desks (such as the Options Desk and
Exotics Desk) also transacted and held, among other products, swaption positions. The Swaps
Desk was located in close proximity to the Options Desk.

rates-derivatives/isdafix (last accessed Nov. 22, 2017).

 

 
During the Relevant Period, DBSI either had no or inadequate internal controls or
procedures, written or otherwise, regarding how USD ISDAFIX should be determined or
monitored. ISDAFIX Submitters, for example, received no formal training on making ISDAFIX
submissions, and the Bank did not require submissions to be documented during the Relevant
Period.

3. DBSIâs Positions with Exposure to USD ISDAFIX

Throughout the Relevant Period, DBSI traders, attempted to manipulate USD ISDAFIX,
as discussed more fully below, to maximize profit (or minimize loss) for the DBSI desks trading
cash-settling swaptions and other related financial products in connection with periodic
payments (referred to as âresetsââ) associated with certain interest rate options. The DBSIâs
Options Desk, in coordination with the Swaps Desk, attempted to manipulate USD ISDAFIX in
order to benefit derivatives positions, by increasing their payments from counterparties or
decreasing payments to counterparties in cash-settled interest rate swaptions.

A swaption can be exercised by âphysicalâ delivery of the underlying swap or by cash
settlement. A swaption that expired âin-the-moneyâ would usually physically settle. Swaption
cash settlements denominated in U.S. Dollars are typically calculated based on USD ISDAFIX
rates according to a formula which measures the difference between the relevant USD ISDAFIX
rate on the expiry date and the strike rate of the swaption. Attempts to move USD ISDAFIX
rates in DBSIâs favor, if successful, would hurt the Bankâs counterparties in cash settlement, as
well as any other market participants who had positions referencing USD ISDAFIX on a given
day that were directionally equivalent to DBSIâs counterparty in the same maturity. A small
movement of the benchmark higher or lower (e.g., one basis point or less) could result in
meaningful gain for the Bank on its swaption cash settlements.

In any cash-settling swaption, the Options Deskâs incentive to push the USD ISDAFIX
higher or lower depended on (1) whether DBSI was the owner (buyer) or seller of the swaption
and (2) whether the swaption conferred the right to pay or receive the fixed rate in the underlying
swap.

4. Means Employed in Attempts to Manipulate USD ISDAFIX

Certain DBSI options and/or swaps traders understood and employed two primary means
in their attempts to manipulate USD ISDAFIX rates:

Â¢ First, the relevant DBSI Swaps Desk employees responsible for making USD
ISDAFIX submissions (the âSubmitterâ or âSubmittersâ) attempted to manipulate the
final published USD ISDAFIX rates by submitting rates that deviated from Swaps
Brokerâs reference rates in order to benefit positions held by the Bank.

* Second, certain DBSI traders bid, offered, and/or executed swap spreads and/or U.S.
Treasuries, (at times in one or both of these products) at or around 11:00 a.m. to affect
rates on the 19901 screen and thereby increase or decrease Swaps Brokerâs reference
rates and spreads and influence the final published USD ISDAFIX.
Whichever the means employed, the goal was the sameâto move USD ISDAFIX in the
direction that favored DBSI on specific trading positions at the expense of its counterparties.

a. DBSIâs False, Misleading, or Knowingly Inaccurate Submissions

DBSI attempted to manipulate USD ISDAFIX by making false, misleading, or
knowingly inaccurate submissions to Swaps Broker concerning swap rates and spreads.

On multiple occasions during the Relevant Period, DBSI submitted a rate or spread
higher or lower than Swaps Brokerâs reference rates or spreads. DBSI would change its
submissions from the prepopulated numbers when it had a special motive to do so.

During the Relevant Period, DBSI Submitters knew about the positions of DBSI traders
from three sources: first, the Submitters were able to see the swaption positions of the Options
traders on their computers; second, Submitters learned about the positions of the Options traders
directly from the Options traders; and third, the Submitters sat close enough to the Options Desk
to hear the Options traders talk about their positions. With this knowledge, the Submitters on the
Swaps Desk at DBSI attempted to manipulate the ISDAFIX.

On October 29, 2010, for example, an Options trader acknowledged on a recorded phone
line that the Submitters at DBSI knew about the positions of the DBSI Options traders. This was
further corroborated by a Submitter, a DBSI Swaps trader, who confirmed that on October 29,
2010, he knew about an Options traderâs position, understood how he could manipulate the
ISDAFIX to benefit that position, and then changed DBSIâs ISDAFIX submission to benefit that
position. The Submitter in fact lowered DBSIâs rates submission to attempt to benefit DBSIâs
cash-settled swaption on this date.

During the Relevant Period, DBSI memorialized its manipulative conduct of making
false, misleading, or knowingly inaccurate submissions through a Swap Desk Guide (the
Guideâ), which was authored by a Submitter. The Guide states the following:

Swap dealer desks submit 11 a.m. levels of rate and spreads for option striking
purposes. The options desk may ask for specific levels.

The language in the Guide instructs the Submitters to submit rates and spreads at a
targeted level or price sought by the Options traders. This instruction is both improper and
illegal because the prices sought by the Options traders were sought to benefit their positions.
The then-Head of the Swaps Desk at DBSI, for example, confirmed that if an Options trader
asked the Swaps Desk for specific levels and the Submitter complied with that request, that
would be wrong because that would be âfixing the rate.â

As reflected in the Guide and the conduct of DBSIâs traders and Submitters, DBSIâs
changes in its USD ISDAFIX submissions were not made to reflect the mean of where DBSI
would itself bid or offer the swap in the relevant maturity, but rather the changes were made in
many instances to benefit certain derivatives positions held by DBSI. Indeed, DBSI traders
requested submissions that deviated from Swaps Brokerâs reference rates and spreads on certain

days when they had an interest (1.e., if DBSI had a cash-settling swaption or other derivatives
position tied to USD ISDAFIX).
As stated above, a Submitter confirmed that on October 29, 2010, he lowered DBSIâs
ISDAFIX submission to attempt to benefit DBSIâs cash-settled swaption on this date. This was
not an isolated or one-off attempt to manipulate the ISDAFIX to benefit a DBSI position.
Another example occurred on June 7, 2010, a day when DBSI was cash settling a 2-year $4
billion swaption. DBSI would receive higher payments from its counterparty if the 2-year
ISDAFIX benchmark set lower. On that same day, the DBSI Submitter lowered DBSIâs rates
submission by 0.5 basis points to attempt to benefit that cash-settled swaption to the detriment of
DBSIâs client and counterparty.

There is no doubt that DBSI Submitters understood that when a request was made to
change a submission the request was to benefit an underlying position of the Bank. For example,
then-Head of the Swaps Desk confirmed that he understood that when an Options trader asked a
Submitter to make submissions that were different than what the Submitter would otherwise
normally do, that the Options trader was âtrying to influence somethingâ because of his
âeconomic interestâ in the submission.

b. DBSIâs Improper Trading Conduct

In addition to making false submissions in an effort to influence the final setting of USD
ISDAFIX benchmarks, DBSI on multiple occasions attempted to manipulate USD ISDAFIX by
bidding, offering, or trading swap spreads and U.S. Treasuries at and around Swaps Brokerâs
11:00 a.m. snapshot, in a manner designed to move USD ISDAFIX rates in a direction that
would benefit the Bank.Â® DBSI traders told the Swaps Broker the direction they wanted the
Swaps Broker to move the ISDAFIX to benefit their positions tied to the ISDAFIX.

As evidenced in a series of recorded calls and electronic communications between a
DBSI trader and the Swaps Broker trading on behalf of DBSI, DBSI traders talked about
âpushingâ or âmovingâ the fix in a direction to benefit the Bankâs positions or âgetting the
printâ at a price that would benefit the Bankâs position. In order to affect these strategies, DBSI
Swap traders would tell the Swaps Broker their need for a certain swap level at 11:00 a.m. or
their need to have the level moved up or down. For example, in the Swaps Brokerâs recorded
words to a DBSI Swaps trader, on February 28, 2007, he stated: âI had to do what I had to do to
keep âem down, right...We got the print...50 is not going to hold it.â This conversation
demonstrates that the Swaps Broker fully understood that the DBSI trader wanted to keep the
price down and get the print that would benefit the position of the DBSI Swaps trader.

In another telling example of the mindset of DBSI Traders, on December 3, 2008, shortly
before 11:00 a.m., in a recorded conversation between a DBSI Swaps trader and the Swaps
Broker, the DBSI Swaps trader makes it clear that he understands that you push prices to benefit

 

Â° DBSI traders referred to trades that they made around 11:00 a.m. for risk management purposes as hedging. When
DBSI's derivative products cash-settled, reset, or otherwise fixed to a benchmark, changes in the desksâ risk
positions could potentially cause traders to seek hedging trades, depending on a variety of factors, including the risk
profile of other positions and whether the desk wanted to keep any resulting risk. Likewise, with internal ISDAFIX
trades between desks, the desk taking on new risk, depending on a variety of factors, might have a reason or desire
to hedge. Irrespective of whether the DBSI traders had an interest in hedging, the traders engaged in attempted
manipulation when they placed bids and offers or executed trades around 11:00 a.m. with the improper intent to
move the USD ISDAFIX rate in DBSI's favor.
your positions and only hedge when no one else is willing to âplay the game.â The actual
conversation is as follows:

Swaps Broker: Right, listen, if thereâs no activity.

DBSI Swaps trader: Yeah?

Swaps Broker: What do you want to do there?

DBSI Swaps trader: What do you mean if thereâs no activity?

Swaps Broker: If thereâs no activity, you know...

DBSI Swaps trader: There will be some activity.

Swaps Broker: Ok.

DBSI Swaps trader: Yeah.

Swaps Broker: Not from you, /âm talking about if no one else wants to play the
game. (Emphasis added.)

DBSI Swaps trader: Oh, then what? I mean I'll be showing prices, Pll be showing
offers.

Swaps Broker: Ok but what sort of level do you want to push it to?

DBSI Swaps trader: I mean, I donât know it depends.

Swaps Broker: It depends who comes into play. If no one comes into play, whatâs
going to suit you? (Emphasis added.)

DBSI Swaps trader: Oh, I donât know, I mean I have risk, so Iâm trying to hedge that
risk, if like, â'm not going to say âoh I want,â I canât, I just have
risk so Iâm just going to try to hedge it.

Swaps Broker: Oh, alright.

During the Relevant Period, DBSIâs traders used various means in attempts to move USD

ISDAFIX higher or lower to benefit their derivatives trading positions. For example, in order to
âget 2s downâ by trading, a trader must sell 2-year swap spreads lower than the current market
mid-swap spread indicated on the 19901 screen. Likewise, âgetting 10s higherâ for example
involves buying 10-year swap spreads higher than the current mid-swap spread indicated on the
19901 screen. In attempts to push the USD ISDAFIX higher or lower, DBSI traders were
willing, at times, to buy higher or sell lower than the market required, or traded at times when
they otherwise would not have, because they expected to benefit their cash settlements to an
extent that would likely exceed, but at least cover, any resulting trading losses incurred through
such trading.
The manipulative trading by DBSI traders typically involved a communication from a
DBSI trader to the Swaps Broker to trade in a certain direction. These directional instructions
demonstrated the DBSI traderâs desire to move price levels in an attempt to manipulate USD
ISDAFIX. For example, on November 10, 2008, just prior to 11:00 a.m. a DBSI Swaps trader
informed the Swaps Broker he wanted the â10 yr lowerâ and the Swaps Broker responded âk.â
On this day in order to attempt to effectuate this manipulation, DBSI sold 10-year swap spreads
and bought U.S. treasuries, both of which would have would have a downward impact on where
the 10-year rate set.

In each of the following examples, the DBSI trader communicates to the Swaps Broker
the direction he wants to move the USD ISDAFIX. The Swaps Broker then trades swap spreads
and/or U.S. treasuries on behalf of the DBSI trader to move the setting of the USD ISDAFIX
either higher or lower to benefit the DBSI traderâs underlying cash-settled swaption:

On July 28, 2008, DBSI was settling two 5-year swaptions with an aggregate
notional value of $350 million; DBSIâs payments to its counterparty would be
lower if the 5-year USD ISDAFIX benchmark settled higher. That day, DBSI
Swaps trader complained to Swaps Broker on a recorded line about his buying of
5-year swap spreads not moving the 5-years so Swaps Broker told the DBSI
Swaps trader that he was âtrying to get this stuff, this print done.â On that day,
DBSI bought 5-year swap spreads through that Swaps Broker, which would have
had an upward impact on where the 5-year rate set.

On August 26, 2008, DBSI was cash settling a 5-year $300 million swaption;
DBSI would receive a higher payment from its counterparty if the 5-year USD
ISDAFIX benchmark set lower. On a recorded line that day, DBSI Swaps trader
told Swaps Broker that he needs âa lower print.. if I can get it at the fixing.â On
that day, DBSI sold 5-year swap spreads and bought 5-year U.S. treasuries before
11 a.m., which would have had a downward impact on the setting of the 5-year
USD ISDAFIX rate.

On October 2, 2008, DBSI was cash settling a 10-year $1 billion swaption;
DBSIâs_ payment to its counterparty would be lower if the 10-year USD
ISDAFIX benchmark set higher. That day, the Swaps Broker asked the DBSI
trader on a recorded line: âwhat am I doing, lifting them up?â On that day, DBSI
âlifted upâ or bought 10-year swap spreads, which would have had an upward
impact on where the 10-year rate set.

On May 26, 2009, DBSI was cash settling 7-year swaptions with a combined
notional value of $500 million; DBSIâs payments to its counterparties would be
lower if the 7-year ISDAFIX benchmark set lower. That day, in order to prepare
for the manipulative conduct, DBSI Swaps trader told Swaps Broker shortly
before 11:00 a.m. in a recorded conversation, âI have a set on 7s.â At
approximately 11:02 a.m., the same DBSI trader asked the Swaps Broker in an
electronic communication âwhat is going out as the suggestion for the poll?â and
in a self-congratulatory response the Swaps Broker said â22.75...we did it.â At
approximately 11:13 a.m., a DBSI Options trader sent the following electronic

10
communication to the same DBSI Swaps Trader and the then-Head of the Options
Desk detailing the steps taken to attempt to effectuate this manipulation: âwe cash
settled w/[another bank] but bot into the fix to push the rate.ââ Indeed, on this
same day, DBSI bought 7-year U.S. treasuries before 11 a.m. and sold 7-year
swap spreads through Swaps Broker, both of which would have had a downward
impact on where the 7-year rate set. On April 30, 2010, DBSI was cash settling a
portion of a 2-year $2 billion swaption; DBSI would receive a higher payment
from its counterparty if the 2-year USD ISDAFIX benchmark set lower. That
day, Swaps Broker asked the DBSI Swaps trader on a recorded line if he wanted
him to âhitâ the 2-years âdownâ and the DBSI Swaps trader responded, âOK,
yeah, yours 2.â"" On that day, DBSI sold 2-year swap spreads and bought 2-year
U. S. Treasuries before 11 a.m., both of which would have had a downward
impact on where the 2-year rate set.

On June 7, 2010, DBSI was cash settling a 2-year $4 billion swaption; DBSI
would receive higher payments from its counterparty if the 2-year ISDAFIX
benchmark set lower. In an electronic communication, , DBSI Swaps trader told
Swaps Broker âIâm going to be selling some 2y spreads at | lam; pls be ready.â
DBSI bought 2-year U.S. Treasuries before 11 a.m. and sold 2-year swap spreads
through Swaps Broker, both of which would have had a downward impact on
where the 2-year rate set.

* On October 29, 2010, DBSI was cash settling 5-year swaptions it bought with a
combined notional value of $4 billion; DBSI would receive higher payments from
its counterparties if the 5-year ISDAFIX benchmark set lower. That day, DBSI
Swaps trader told another DBSI trader that the Options Desk had â4bn 5s with [a
client] coming off at 11am (probably another 2bn away frm them). Basically
means they will be selling the shIt out of 5s at any yield below 119.â DBSI
bought 5-year U.S. Treasuries before 11 a.m. and sold 5-year swap spreads
through Swaps Broker, both of which would have had a downward impact on
where the 5-year rate set. Also, on this same date, as explained above, a DBSI
Submitter intentionally lowered DBSIâs rates submission to attempt to benefit
DBSIâs 5-year cash-settled swaption.

In addition to directing the Swaps Broker to trade in a certain direction to benefit their
positions, some DBSI swaps traders would identify DBSIâs target print and instruct the Swaps
Broker to hit that print in order to maximize their profits. In order to hit the target print, the
DBSI trader would be willing to spend their âammoâ to optimize their chances of getting their
desired screen result. For example, on August 13, 2009, the Swaps Broker needed to know how
much âammoâ he has to move the screen at 11 and stated, âin future tho mate like we did with
the ly that time I need to have an idea of ammo as I can only close screen initially.â (Emphasis
added.) The DBSI Swaps trader responded, âok. I will try and do a better job at that. But if â'm
saying 23.75 offer, I sell keep selling 50 lots. I canât get angry at you if you sell a bunch if I
keep saying offer on... just keep me updated on how many ive done.â

DBSI traders also knew their conduct in attempting to manipulate the USD ISDAFIX
was illegal. For instance, on May 11, 2011, a DBSI Swaps trader stated that âI really have no

11
desire to ever trade equities. Itâs just a field day for the feds.â A broker (âBrokerâ) from another
swaps broking firm responded, âthis will be over soon as well and if they ever figured out
exactly how pricing happened through [the Swaps Broker] on a daily basis a lot of people would
actually do jail time.â Approximately fifteen months later, there is another electronic exchange
between the same Broker from the swaps broking firm and a DBSI Trader who was also a former
Submitter as follows:

DBSI trader: Youâre one of the few still there at 4:45... What happened to NY?
Broker: This market is dying dude.
DBSI trader: Nau guys have licked ur n*** and have rolled over.
Broker: Go to bed dude.
DBSI trader: Some of us need to support some of you it seem. [Swaps Broker] gone.
Broker: But donât matter cause after libor, 19901 is next.
DBSI trader: Yes.
IV.
LEGAL DISCUSSION
A. Jurisdiction

As set forth below, Sections 6(c), 6(d), and 9(a)(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 9, 13b,
13(a)(2) (2012), have long prohibited attempted manipulation of the prices of, or false reporting
in regard to, any commodity in interstate commerce or for future delivery on or subject to the
rules of any registered entity. An interest rate benchmark, such as USD ISDAFIX, is a
commodity, see CEA Â§ 1a(QQ), (19), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1a), (19) (2012), and therefore may be subject
to illegal attempted manipulation, whatever the manipulative means may be.

Here, DBSIâs attempted manipulation is also proscribed by the Act for the separate
reason that the conduct involved swaps executed or traded on a Swaps Broker desk that operated
in practice as a âtrading facilityâ under the Act. See CEA Â§ 1a(51), 7 U.S.C. Â§ La(51) (2012)
(defining trading facility); see also former CEA Â§ 2(d)(1)(B), 2(g)(3), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(d)(1)(B),
2(g)(3) (2006; repealed 2011) (limiting jurisdictional exclusions to agreements, contracts, or
transactions not executed or traded on a trading facility).

Lastly, as a result of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of
2010 (âDodd-Frank Actâ), the Commission also has authority to initiate proceedings and impose
sanctions for a broader range of manipulative conduct and false reporting, including in
connection with any swap. See Sections 6(c)(1), 6(c)(1)(A), 6(c)(3), 6(d), 9(a)(2) of the Act, and
Regulations 180.1(a) and 180.2, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 180.1(a), 180.2 (2017). The Relevant Period
encompasses conduct that occurred after the passage and effective date of the Dodd-Frank Act.

12
B. Respondent Attempted To Manipulate USD ISDAFIX

Section 9(a)(2) of the Act makes it unlawful for â[a]ny person to manipulate or attempt to
manipulate the price of any commodity in interstate commerce, or for future delivery on or
subject to the rules of any registered entity.ââ With respect to conduct on or after July 16, 2011,
amended Section 9(a)(2) of the Act also makes it unlawful to manipulate or attempt to
manipulate the price of âany swap.â

For conduct prior to August 15, 2011, former Section 6(c) and 6(d) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
Â§Â§ 9, 13b (2006; amended 2011), authorized the Commission to serve a complaint and impose,
among other things, civil monetary penalties and cease and desist orders if the Commission âhas
reason to believe that any person .. . has manipulated or attempted to manipulate the market
price of any commodity, in interstate commerce, or for future delivery on or subject to the rules

of any registered entity, . . . or otherwise is violating or has violated any of the provisions of [the]
Act.â

For conduct occurring on or after August 15, 2011, the Commission is authorized to serve
a complaint and impose penalties and orders with regard to attempted manipulation in violations
of the broader amended provisions of Section 6(c)(1) and 6(c)(3) of the Act and the Regulations
implementing those provisions. See CEA Â§Â§ 6(c)(4)(A), 6(d).

Section 6(c)(1) and 6(c)(1)(A) of the Act and Regulation 180.1 prohibit the use or
attempted use of any manipulative device, including false reporting, in connection with any swap
or contract of sale of any commodity in interstate commerce, or for future delivery, and
Regulation 180.1(a) makes it âunlawful .. . , directly or indirectly, in connection with any swap,
or contract of sale of any commodity in interstate commerce, or contract for future delivery on or
subject to the rules of any registered entity, to... (1) [uJse... or attempt to use... any
manipulative device; (2) [m]Jake, or attempt to make, any untrue or misleading statement of a
material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made
not untrue or misleading; (3) [e]ngage, or attempt to engage, in any act, practice, or course of
business, which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person; or, (4) [d]eliver
or cause to be delivered, or attempt to deliver or cause to be delivered, for transmission through
the mails or interstate commerce, . . . a false or misleading or inaccurate report concerning . . .
market information or conditions that affect or tend to affect the price of any commodity in
interstate commerce.â

Section 6(c)(3) of the Act prohibits the attempted manipulation of the price of any
commodity in interstate commerce and Regulation 180.2 makes it âunlawful . . . directly or
indirectly, to... attempt to manipulate the price of any swap, or of any commodity in interstate
commerce, or for future delivery on or subject to the rules of any registered entity.â

To prove attempted manipulation under Sections 9(a)(2) and 6(c)(3) of the Act and
Commission Regulation 180.2, the following two elements are required: (1) an intent to affect
market price, and (2) an overt act in furtherance of that intent. See In re Hohenberg Bros. Co.,
CFTC No. 75-4, 1977 WL 13562, at *7 (Feb. 18, 1977). To prove the intent element of
attempted manipulation, the respondent must have âacted (or failed to act) with the purpose or
conscious object of causing or effecting a price or price trend in the market that did not reflect

13
the legitimate forces of supply and demand.â Jn re Ind. Farm Bureau Coop. Assân, CFTC No.
75-14, 1982 WL 30249, at *7 (Dec. 17, 1982). â[W]hile knowledge of relevant market
conditions is probative of intent, it is not necessary to prove that the accused knew to any
particular degree of certainty that his actions would create an artificial price. /t is enough to
present evidence from which it may reasonably be inferred that the accused âconsciously
desire[d] that result, whatever the likelihood of that result happening from his conduct.â Id.
(emphasis added) (quoting United States v. U.S. Gypsum Co., 438 U.S. 442, 445 (1978)). A
profit motive may also be evidence of intent, although profit motive is not a necessary element of
an attempted manipulation. See In re DiPlacido, CFTC No. 01-23, 2008 WL 4831204, at *29
(Nov. 5, 2008) (citing In re Hohenberg Bros. Co., CFTC No. 75-4, 1977 WL 13562, at *8), aff'd
sub, nom. DiPlacido v. CFTC, 364 Fed. Appâx 657 (2d Cir. 2009). It is also not necessary that
there be an actual effect on price. See CFTC v. Amaranth Advisors, L.L.C., 554 F. Supp. 2d 523,
533 (S.D.N.Y. 2008).

1. Respondent Attempted To Manipulate USD ISDAFIX Through False,
Misleading, or Knowingly Inaccurate Submissions

As evidenced by certain electronic communications, testimony of then-current and
former DBSI employees, and DBSIâs USD ISDAFIX submissions themselves, certain DBSI
traders specifically intended to affect the rate at which USD ISDAFIX was set by making false,
misleading, or knowingly inaccurate submissions to Swaps Broker for inclusion in the
calculation of the daily rates. During the Relevant Period, DBSI submitted market information,
specifically rates that were supposed to reflect the mean of where DBSI would itself offer and
bid a USD denominated swap in the relevant maturity to an acknowledged dealer of good credit,
to Swaps Broker that were used as part of the process for determining the daily USD ISDAFIX
rate for the various maturities. However, rather than submitting rates and spreads that reflected
DBSIâs honest view of the true costs of entering into a standard USD interest-rate swap in
particular maturities, DBSI knowingly made submissions with the intent to move USD ISDAFIX
rates higher or lower in order to benefit DBSIâs trading positions. Through its false, misleading,
or knowingly inaccurate submissions, DBSI attempted to manipulate USD ISDAFIX for
numerous tenors.

The DBSI tradersâ requests for certain rates to be submitted which would benefit their
trading positions, and the submissions resulting from those requests, constituted overt acts in
furtherance of the tradersâ intent to affect USD ISDAFIX. By doing so, the DBSI traders
engaged in acts of attempted manipulation in violations of Section 9(a)(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
Â§13(a)(2) (2012); Sections 6(c) and 6(d) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 9, 13b (2006), for conduct
occurring prior to August 15, 2011; and Sections 6(c)(1), 6(c)(1)(A), 6(c)(3) and 6(d) of the Act,
7TUS.C. Â§Â§ 9(1), 93), 13b (2012), and Regulations 180.1(a) and 180.2, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 180.1(a),
180.2 (2017), for conduct occurring on or after August 15, 2011.

2. Respondent Attempted To Manipulate USD ISDAFIX Through Improper
Trading Conduct

As evidenced by the communications among certain DBSI employees and between
certain DBSI employees and their brokers, as well as certain trading conduct, DBSI traders
specifically intended to manipulate USD ISDAFIX by placing bids or offers or executing trades

14
in the moments leading into 11:00 a.m. designed in a manner, including timing and pricing, to
increase or decrease swap spreads and/or U.S. Treasuries at 11:00 a.m., with the intent to affect
levels reported on the 19901 screen and USD ISDAFIX fixings. Moreover, the evidence reflects
that certain traders intended such trading conduct to affect the fixings in order to benefit DBSIâs
trading positions against its counterparties.

The DBSI tradersâ bids, offers, and executed trades in the moments leading into 11:00
a.m., which were intended to manipulate USD ISDAFIX, as well as the tradersâ communications
with each other and with their Swaps Broker brokers to plan and execute this trading conduct,
constituted overt acts in furtherance of their intent to manipulate USD ISDAFIX. By doing so,
the DBSI traders engaged in acts of attempted manipulation in violations of Section 9(a)(2) of the
Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13(a)(2) (2012); Sections 6(c) and 6(d) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 9, 13b (2006), for
conduct occurring prior to August 15, 2011; and Sections 6(c)(1), 6(c)(1)(A), 6(c)(3) and 6(d) of
the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 9(1), 9(3), 13b (2012), and Regulations 180.1(a) and 180.2, 17 C.F.R.
Â§Â§$180.1(a), 180.2 (2017), for conduct occurring on or after August 15, 2011.

C. Respondent Made False, Misleading, or Knowingly Inaccurate Reports Concerning
USD ISDAFIX in violations of Section 9(a)(2) of the Act

In addition to the prohibition on attempted manipulation contained in Section 9(a)(2) of
the Act, that provision also makes it unlawful for any person âknowingly to deliver or cause to
be delivered for transmission through the mails or interstate commerce by telegraph, telephone,
wireless, or other means of communication false or misleading or knowingly inaccurate reports
concerning crop or market information or conditions that affect or tend to affect the price of any
commodity in interstate commerce.â See also United States v. Brooks, 681 F.3d 678, 703-05
(Sth Cir. 2012) (affirming the district courtâs conviction of defendants for false reporting of
natural gas trades in violations of the Act and finding that ââit is âclear beyond a reasonable doubt
that a rational juryâ would have found that the Defendants-Appellants had knowledge that their
reports affected or tended to affect the price of natural gasâ); United States v. Valencia, 394 F.3d
352, 354-57 (Sth Cir. 2004) (reversing and remanding to the district court and holding that the
knowledge requirement of the reporting prong of Â§ 9(a)(2) applies to the false or misleading
character of the reports, as well as to delivery and inaccuracy); CFTC v. Johnson, 408 F. Supp.
2d 259, 267 (S.D. Tex. 2005) (finding that the facts alleged in the CFTCâs complaint adequately
stated a claim against the defendants for the delivery of knowingly inaccurate information).

During the Relevant Period, DBSI, through electronic and telephonic transmission of
information to Swaps Broker, on multiple occasions, knowingly delivered or caused to be
delivered the Bankâs USD ISDAFIX submissions through the mails or interstate commerce.
DBSIâs submissions were also delivered through the mails or interstate commerce through daily
dissemination and publication globally, including throughout the United States, of the official
published rates for USD ISDAFIX, as determined by averaging the submissions of DBSI and
other panel banks after âtopping and tailing.â Data on submissions themselves were also
disseminated. DBSIâs daily USD ISDAFIX submissions contained market information
concerning the mean of where DBSI would itself offer and bid a swap in the relevant maturity to
an acknowledged dealer of good credit in the swap market absent intent to manipulate USD
ISDAFIX. Such market information affected or tended to affect the prices of commodities in

15
interstate commerce, including the daily fixing rates for USD ISDAFIX, as well as the on-
exchange interest rate swap futures and other financial instruments which relied upon those rates.

During the Relevant Period, DBSIâs USD ISDAFIX submissions on multiple occasions
constituted false, misleading, or knowingly inaccurate reports because they purported to reflect
DBSIâs honest view of the true costs of entering into a standard fixed-for-floating interest rate
swap in particular tenors, but in fact on multiple occasions reflected tradersâ desire to move USD
ISDAFIX higher or lower in order to benefit their positions.

By using these impermissible factors in making its USD ISDAFIX submissions and
without disclosing that it based its submissions on these impermissible factors, DBSI conveyed
false, misleading, or knowingly inaccurate information that the rates it submitted were based on
the prices at which DBSI would offer and bid swaps to an acknowledged dealer of good credit in
the swaps market absent intent to manipulate USD ISDAFIX. Moreover, certain DBSI
employees knew that DBSIâs USD ISDAFIX submissions contained false, misleading, or
knowingly inaccurate information. By such conduct, Respondent violated Section 9(a)(2) of the
Act.

D. Respondent Is Liable for the Acts of Its Agents

Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(a)(1)(B) (2012), and Regulation 1.2,
17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.2 (2017), provide that â[t]he act, omission, or failure of any official, agent, or other
person acting for any individual, association, partnership, corporation, or trust within the scope
of his employment or office shall be deemed the act, omission, or failure of such individual,
association, partnership, corporation, or trust.â Pursuant to Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act and
Regulation 1.2, strict liability is imposed on principals for the actions of their agents. See, e.g.,
Dohmen-Ramirez & Wellington Advisory, Inc. v. CFTC, 837 F.2d 847, 857-58 (9th Cir. 1988);
Rosenthal & Co. v. CFTC, 802 F.2d 963, 966 (7th Cir. 1986); CFTC v. Byrnes, 58 F. Supp. 3d
319, 324 (S.D.N.Y. 2014).

DBSIis liable for the acts, omissions, and failures of any traders, managers, and
Submitters who acted as its employees and/or agents in the conduct described above.
Accordingly, as set forth above, DBSI violated Section 9(a)(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13(a)(2)
(2012); Sections 6(c) and 6(d) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. $Â§ 9, 13b (2006), for conduct occurring prior
to August 15, 2011; and Sections 6(c)(1), 6(c)(1)(A), 6(c)(3) and 6(d) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§
9(1), 9(3), 13b (2012), and Regulations 180.1(a) and 180.2, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 180.1(a), 180.2 (2017),
for conduct occurring on or after August 15, 2011.

16
V.

the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13(a)(2) (2012); Sections 6(c) and 6(d) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 9, 13b (2006), for
conduct occurring prior to August 15, 2011; and Sections 6(c)(1), 6(c)(1)(A), 6(c)(3) and 6(d) of the Act,

18
Represents that it has already undertaken certain steps intended to make
reasonable efforts to ensure the integrity of interest-rate swap benchmarks,
including, but not limited to, the following:

1.

Respondent has conducted a global review of risks relating to benchmark-
related activities, including the processes and controls governing its
participation in benchmark rates, including USD ISDAFIX.

Respondent enhanced procedures and controls relating to its participation
in USD ISDAFIX, including, but not limited to, the following:

a.

In 2011, Respondent completed a risk assessment of the USD ISDAFIX
submissions process and recommended various enhancements, which
were implemented shortly thereafter, including the daily recording of
submissions on a network drive accessible only to those involved in the

submissions process and the drafting of new operating procedures for
USD ISDAFIX submissions;

In 2013, Respondent also placed USD ISDAFIX submissions under the

oversight of an independent risk management group that conducted daily
post-submission reviews as well as broader cross-functional management
reviews to discuss submissions for ISDAFIX and other benchmark rates;

Respondent transitioned to a fully automated system for USD ISDAFIX
submissions in 2013, which transmitted submissions to the benchmark
collection agent based on live prices from DBSIâs internal electronic
systems and prohibited DBSI traders from accessing the USD ISDAFIX
submissions screen; and

Respondent withdrew from USD ISDAFIX (and all other ISDAFIX
benchmarks to which it still contributed) in April 2014.

Further, Respondent has enhanced policies, procedures, and controls relating to
participation in benchmarks as follows:

a.

Establishment in 2014 of an expanded independent control function, the
Benchmark and Index Control Group, to monitor benchmark activities
and to provide guidance on policies, best practices, and controls design
related to benchmarks;

Implementation of procedures designed to detect and prevent potential
manipulation of benchmark rates, including daily pre- and post-
submission reviews and daily monitoring of exposure to benchmark

fixings by independent control functions;

Enhanced surveillance of tradersâ electronic and oral communications;

19
d. Development of a trade surveillance program designed to identify and
escalate potentially unusual trading patterns, including for products tied
to the setting of benchmarks;

e. Benchmark training for traders, submitters, supervisors, and others who
are involved in or rely on benchmark fixings, tailored to the employeeâ s
role and responsibilities;

f. Establishment of an internal audit team dedicated exclusively to auditing
benchmark-related activities;

g. Annual risk assessments to tailor and refine individualized controls for
benchmarks susceptible to manipulation and to which Respondent is
exposed;

h. Establishment of governance bodies to oversee benchmark activities,

including the Benchmark and Index Council, which is responsible for
addressing global benchmark strategy and serves as the central escalation
point for issues related to benchmarks; and

1. Promulgation of policies and procedures to guide employees in
connection with benchmark contributions, including, but not limited to, a
Global Benchmark Policy, issued in January 2013 and applicable to all
employees, and specific guidelines for particular benchmarks.

4. Respondent has also initiated broad improvements to firm-wide business
practices and systems and controls, including, but not limited to, the following:

a. Defining a set of core values and beliefs which it embedded into
various business and personnel practices, including a revised Code
of Business Conduct and Ethics prescribing minimum standards of
ethical business conduct for employees in their interactions with
each other and external stakeholders; and

b. Engaging in significant efforts to strengthen the role and visibility of
Compliance, including by increasing Complianceâs presence on the
trading floor, expanding its representation on management committees,
increasing Complianceâs budget and headcount, and further integrating
Compliance into hiring, promotion, and compensation decisions.

Upon consideration, the Commission has determined to accept the Offer.

or unlawful activity relating to the fixing of any benchmark based
on interest-rate swaps with escalation to compliance and legal, and
with reporting of material matters to the executive management of
DBSI and the Commission, as appropriate; the Respondent shall

22
maintain the record basis of the handling of each such matter for a
period of three years.

Within 120 days of the entry of this Order, the Respondent shall make a
report to the Commission, through the Division, concerning its
remediation efforts prior to and since the entry of this Order. Within 365
days of the entry of this Order, the Respondent shall submit a report to the

COOPERATION WITH THE COMMISSION

In this action, and in any investigation or other action instituted by the
Commission related to the subject matter of this action, Respondent shall
cooperate fully and expeditiously with the Commission, including the
Division. As part of such cooperation, Respondent agrees to do the
following for a period of three (3) years from the date of the entry of this
Order, or until all related investigations and litigations in which the
Commission, including the Division, is a party, are concluded, including
through the appellate review process, whichever period is longer:

a. Preserve all records relating to the subject matter of this

location, and at such location that minimizes Commission travel
expenditures, to provide assistance at any trial, proceeding, or
Commission investigation related to the subject matter of this

depositions, and/or interviews, and to encourage them to testify

23
completely and truthfully in any such proceeding, trial, or

f. Subject to applicable laws and regulations, make its best efforts to

designate an agent located in the United States of America to receive all
requests for information pursuant to these Undertakings, and shall provide
notice regarding the identity of such Agent to the Division upon entry of
this Order. Should the Bank seek to change the designated agent to
receive such requests, notice of such intention shall be given to the
Division fourteen (14) days before it occurs. Any person designated to
receive such request shall be located in the United States of America.

PROHIBITED OR CONFLICTING UNDERTAKINGS

Should the Undertakings herein be prohibited by, or be contrary to, the
provisions of any obligations imposed on Respondent by any presently
existing, or hereinafter enacted or promulgated laws, rules, regulations, or
regulatory mandates, then Respondent shall promptly transmit notice to
the Commission (through the Division) of such prohibition or conflict, and
shall meet and confer in good faith with the Commission (through the
Division) to reach an agreement regarding possible modifications to the
Undertakings herein sufficient to resolve such inconsistent obligations. In
the interim, Respondent will abide by the obligations imposed by the laws,
rules, regulations, and regulatory mandates. Nothing in these
Undertakings shall limit, restrict or narrow any obligations pursuant to the
Act or the Commissionâs Regulations promulgated thereunder, including,
but not limited to, Regulations 1.31 and 1.35, 17 C.F.R.Â§Â§ 1.31, 1.35
(2017), in effect now or in the future.

PUBLIC STATEMENTS

Respondent agrees that neither it nor any of its successors and assigns,
agents, or employees under its authority or control shall take any action or
make any public statement denying, directly or indirectly, any findings or
conclusions in this Order or creating, or tending to create, the impression
that this Order is without a factual basis; provided, however, that nothing
in this provision shall affect Respondentâs (1) testimonial obligations, or
(11) right to take positions in other proceedings to which the Commission is
not a party. Respondent and its successors and assigns shall undertake all
steps necessary to ensure that all of its agents and/or employees under its
authority or control understand and comply with this agreement.

24
5. PARTIAL SATISFACTION

Respondent understands and agrees that any acceptance by the
Commission of partial payment of Respondentâs CMP Obligation shall not
be deemed a waiver of its obligation to make further payments pursuant to
this Order, or a waiver of the Commissionâs right to seek to compel
payment of any remaining balance.

D. Based on the nature of the violations; the findings made, and the sanctions,
conditions, and undertakings imposed in the Order; and the facts and
representations in DBSIâs Request Letter, the Commission advisesâ that, under
the circumstances, disqualification under Rule 262(a) of Regulation A and Rule
506(d)(1) of Regulation D of the SEC, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 230.262(a), 230.506(d)(1)
(2017), should not arise as a consequence of this Order.Â®

 

7 Rule 506(d)(1)(iii)(B) disqualifies an issuer from relying on the private offering exemptions provided for in Rule
506 if they or certain related parties are âsubject to a final order of . . . [inter alia] the U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission . . . that: . . . [c]onstitutes a final order based on a violations of any law or regulation that
prohibits fraudulent, manipulative, or deceptive conduct.â Rule 506(d)(2)(iii), however, provides that
disqualification âshall not applyâ if the CFTC âadvises in writingâ that disqualification under Rule 506(d)(1)
âshould not arise as a consequence of such order.â See also 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 262(a)(3)(ii), (b)(3) (parallel provisions
under Regulation A); SEC, Exemptions to Facilitate Intrastate and Regional Securities Offerings, 81 Fed. Reg.
83,494, 83,545 (Nov. 21, 2016) (stating that disqualification under Rule 504 arises âabsent a waiver or other
exception provided in Rule 506(d)â).

* In providing this advice, the Commission considered factors similar to those considered by the SEC when it issues
waivers of disqualification under Regulation A and Regulation D. The SEC grants waivers where an applicant has
shown âgood cause and ... if the [SEC] determines that it is not necessary under the circumstances that the
exemptions be denied,â Â§Â§ 17 C.F.R. 230.262(b)(2), 230.506(d)(2)(ii), based on its analysis of how the identified
misconduct bears on the applicantâs fitness to participate in offerings exempted under Regulation A and Regulation
D. See SEC, Div. of Corp. Fin., Waivers of Disqualification Under Regulation A and Rules 505 and 506 of
Regulation D, https://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/guidance/disqualification-waivers.shtml; SEC, Div. of Corp.
Fin., Rule 504 of Regulation D: A Small Entity Compliance Guide for Issuers,
https://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/guidance/rule504-issuer-small-entity-compliance.html. The SEC considers
the following primary factors in determining whether to grant a waiver request: (i) the nature of the violations and
whether it involved the offer or sale of securities; (ii) whether the violations required scienter; (ii) who was
responsible for the misconduct; (iv) what was the duration of the misconduct; (v) what remedial steps have been
taken; and (vi) the impact on the party seeking a waiver and third parties if a waiver is denied. Respondentâs
Request Letter addressed these factors in the context of this Order.

 

 

The Commission considers these factors in the context of the markets it regulates, and also takes into account
whether it determined that a statutory disqualification under the Act should arise solely based on the misconduct
found herein and leading to disqualification under Regulation A and Regulation D. The Commission is guided by
waivers granted by the SEC in prior cases involving similar facts and circumstances. See, e.g., In re JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A., Securities Act Release No. 9993, 2015 WL 9256636 (Dec. 18, 2015) (SEC order determining that
good cause had been shown that it was not necessary to deny reliance on the exemption under Rule 506 of
Regulation D, where disqualification had been triggered by a CFTC order relating to JEMCBâs failure to adequately
disclose certain conflicts of interest to clients); Jn re UBS AG, Securities Act Release No. 9787, 2015 WL 2395516
(May 20, 2015) (SEC order determining that good cause had been shown that it was not necessary to deny reliance
on the exemption under Rule 506, where disqualification had been triggered by a criminal guilty plea relating to FX
benchmark manipulation and noting the entry of parallel CFTC orders); In re Barclays PLC, Securities Act Release
No. 9786, 2015 WL 2395515 (May 20, 2015) (SEC order determining that good cause had been shown that it was

25
The Commission notes that if the facts are different from those represented, or
DBSI fails to comply with the terms of the Order, the Commission may, in its
discretion, revisit its advice that disqualification should not arise. The
Commission reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to withdraw or otherwise
revoke or further condition its advice under those circumstances.

The provisions of this Order shall be effective as of this date.
By the Commission.

not necessary to deny reliance on the exemption under Rule 506 where disqualification had been triggered by a
CFTC order relating to FX benchmark and ISDAFIX manipulation); see also, e.g., Piper Jaffray & Co., SEC No-
Action Letter, 2015 WL 4451053 (July 20, 2015) (SEC no-action letter determining that good cause had been show
that it was not necessary to deny reliance on the exemptions under Regulation A and Rule 506 of Regulation D,
where disqualification had been triggered by an SEC order, and applying the same factors to consideration of waiver
for both exemptions).
