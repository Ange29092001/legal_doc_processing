Mobile Telesystems Pjsc and Its Uzbek Subsidiary Enter into Resolutions of $850 Million with the
Department of Justice for Paying Bribes in Uzbekistan

Former General Director of MTSâs Uzbek Subsidiary and Former Uzbek Official Charged in Bribery and Money
Laundering Scheme Totaling Almost $1 Billion

Moscow-based Mobile TeleSystems PJSC (MTS), the largest mobile telecommunications company in Russia and an issuer of publicly traded
securities in the United States, and its wholly owned Uzbek subsidiary, KOLORIT DIZAYN INK LLC (KOLORIT), have entered into resolutions with
the Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and agreed to pay a combined total penalty of $850 million to resolve
charges arising out of a scheme to pay bribes in Uzbekistan. In addition, charges were unsealed today against a former Uzbek official who is
the daughter of the former president of Uzbekistan and against the former CEO of Uzdunrobita LLC, another MTS subsidiary, for their
participation in a bribery and money laundering scheme involving more than $865 million in bribes from MTS, VimpelCom Limited (now VEON)
and Telia Company AB (Telia) to the former Uzbek official in order to secure her assistance in entering and maintaining their business
operations in Uzbekistanâs telecommunications market.

Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman of the
Southern District of New York, Special Agent in Charge Raymond Villanueva of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcementâs Homeland Security
Investigations (HSI) Washington, D.C. and Chief Don Fort of IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS-Cl) made the announcement.

Gulnara Karimova, 46, a citizen of Uzbekistan, was charged in an indictment filed in the Southern District of New York on March 7 with one
count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. Karimova is a former Uzbek official who allegedly had influence over the Uzbek governmental
body that regulated the telecom industry. Bekhzod Akhmedov, 44, a citizen of Uzbekistan and the former Uzbek executive, was charged in the
same indictment with one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), two counts of violating the FCPA, and one
count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. Karimovaâs and Akhmedovâs case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood of the
Southern District of New York.

âGulnara Karimova stands accused of exploiting her official position to solicit and accept more than $865 million in bribes from three publicly
traded telecom companies, and then laundering those bribes through the U.S. financial system,â said Assistant Attorney General Benczkowski.
âThe indictment and corporate resolution announced today, together with two prior corporate resolutions involving bribes allegedly paid to
Karimova, demonstrate the Departmentâs comprehensive approach to foreign corruption: we will aggressively pursue both corrupt foreign
officials and the companies and individuals who bribe them in order to gain unfair business advantages, and we will do everything we can to
keep the proceeds of that corruption out of the U.S. financial system.â

âThis is the third installment in a trilogy of cases arising from an almost $1 billion bribery scheme that reached the highest echelons of the
Uzbekistan government and was orchestrated by some of the largest telecommunications companies in the world,â said U.S. Attorney Berman.
âBy funneling multimillion-dollar bribe payments through the U.S. financial system, the companies and individual defendants corruptly tried to
tip the global economy in their favor and line their own pockets. But they are now paying the price. Today, my Office and our law enforcement
partners are sending a bold, unequivocal message that the U.S. financial system is not in business to enable foreign bribery or money
laundering. This Office stands ready to prevent, prosecute, and penalize foreign corrupt practices wherever in the world we find them.â

âCorruption of this level and reach poisons our integrity as a participant in the global marketplace,â said HSI Washington Special Agent in
Charge Villanueva. âThanks to our skillful and collaborative investigators at HSI and the IRS-Cl, Karimova and Ahkmedovâs exploitive crimes will
be presented before the just eye of our courts and no longer will such corruption be permitted to metastasize across our borders.â

âWith the increase in globalization and ease with which funds can be moved, criminals think their financial transactions cannot be trackedâbut
they would be wrong,â said IRS-Cl Chief Fort. âWe will continue to investigate violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act to ensure our
countryâs financial institutions are not used for devious purposes. We are committed to aggressively pursuing all who engage in corruption,
money laundering, and bribery for their own personal gain and at the expense of the U.S. government.â

According to the indictment against Karimova and Akhmedov, in or around the early 2000s, they agreed that Akhmedov would solicit and
facilitate corrupt bribe payments from telecommunications companies seeking to enter the Uzbek market. In exchange, Karimova allegedly
used her influence over Uzbek authorities to help the telecommunications companies obtain and retain lucrative business opportunities in the
Uzbek telecommunications market. In total, Akhmedov conspired with the telecom companies and others to pay Karimova more than $865
million in bribes, and Akhmedov and Karimova conspired with others to launder and conceal those funds to, from and through bank accounts in
the United States, in order to promote the ongoing bribery scheme, the indictment alleges.

The charges in the indictment are merely allegations, and the defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt
in a court of law.

MTS entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the Department of Justice in connection with a criminal information filed yesterday in
the Southern District of New York charging the company with one count of conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery and books and records

provisions of the FCPA and one count of violating the internal controls provisions of the FCPA. KOLORIT pleaded guilty to a one-count criminal
information filed in the Southern District of New York, charging the company with conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery and books and records
provisions of the FCPA. Pursuant to its agreement with the department, MTS agreed to pay a total criminal penalty of $850 million to the United
States, including a $500,000 criminal fine and $40 million in criminal forfeiture that MTS agreed to pay on behalf of KOLORIT. MTS also agreed
to the imposition of an independent compliance monitor for a term of three years and to implement rigorous internal controls and cooperate
fully with the Departmentâs ongoing investigation, including its investigation of individuals such as Akhmedov and Karimova. The case against
MTS and KOLORIT is assigned to U.S. District Judge J. Paul Oetken of the Southern District of New York.

In related proceedings, MTS reached a settlement with the SEC. Under the terms of its agreement with the SEC, MTS agreed to pay a $100
million civil penalty. Consistent with Coordination of Corporate Resolution Penalties in Parallel and/or Joint Investigations and Proceedings
Arising from the Same Misconduct (Justice Manual 1-12.100), the Department of Justice agreed to credit the civil penalty paid to the SEC as part
of its agreement with MTS. Thus, the combined total amount of criminal and regulatory penalties paid by MTS and KOLORIT to U.S. authorities
will be $850 million.

According to the companiesâ admissions, MTS and KOLORIT, through various managers and employees within MTS, MTSâs Uzbek subsidiaries
Uzdunrobita LLC and KOLORIT, and other affiliated entities, paid approximately $420 million in bribes to Karimova, who had influence over the
Uzbek governmental body that regulated the telecom industry. The bribes were paid on multiple occasions between 2004 and 2012 so that
MTS could enter the Uzbek market through the acquisition of Uzdunrobita and so that Uzdunrobita could gain valuable telecom assets and
continue operating in Uzbekistan. The companies admittedly structured and concealed the bribes through payments to shell companies that
members of MTSâs and Uzdunrobitaâs management knew were beneficially owned by Karimova. MTS and Uzdunrobita also acquired KOLORIT,
knowing that the price MTS and Uzdunrobita paid was inflated, in order to bribe Karimova in exchange for Uzdunrobitaâs continuing to operate
in Uzbekistan. Uzdunrobita made payments to purported charities and for sponsorships to entities related to Karimova. The Uzbek government
expropriated Uzdunrobita in 2012 as a result of MTSâs, Uzdunrobitaâs and KOLORITâs failure to meet Karimovaâs demands for additional
payments.

A number of factors contributed to the Departmentâs criminal resolution with the companies, including (1) the companies did not voluntarily
disclose; (2) the companiesâ level of cooperation and remediation was lacking, not proactive; (3) the nature and seriousness of the office,
including $420 million in bribes to a high-level Uzbek official; and (4) the mitigating factors present in this case, including that the Uzbek
government expropriated the companiesâ telecommunications assets in Uzbekistan, resulting in no realized pecuniary gain to the companies as
a result of the misconduct.

The resolution, reached in coordination with the SECâs resolution, marks the third such resolution by a major international telecommunications
provider for bribery in Uzbekistan. On Feb. 18, 2016, Amsterdam-based VimpelCom and its Uzbek subsidiary, Unitel LLC, entered into
resolutions with the Department of Justice and admitted to a conspiracy to make more than $114 million in bribery payments to Karimova
between 2006 and 2012. On Sept. 21, 2017, Stockholm-based Telia and its Uzbek subsidiary, Coscom LLC, also entered into resolutions with
the Department and admitted to a conspiracy to make more than $331 million in bribery payments to Karimova. The investigation has thus far
yielded a combined total of over $2.6 billion in global fines and disgorgement, including over $1.3 billion in criminal penalties to the United
States. In related actions, the Department has also filed civil complaints seeking the forfeiture of more than $850 million held in bank accounts
in Switzerland, Belgium, Luxembourg and Ireland, which constitute bribe payments made by MTS, VimpelCom and Telia, or funds involved in the
laundering of those corrupt payments to Karimova.

 

The IRS-Cl and HSI are investigating the cases as part of the IRS Global Illicit Financial Team in Washington, D.C. Assistant Chief Ephraim
Wernick and Senior Litigation Counsel Nicola J. Mrazek of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Edward Imperatore
and Daniel Noble of the Southern District of New York are prosecuting the case against MTS and KOLORIT. Assistant Chief Wernick and Trial
Attorney Elina Rubin-Smith of the Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Imperatore and Noble are prosecuting the case against Karimova
and Akhmedov. Trial Attorney Michael Khoo of the Criminal Divisionâs Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section (MLARS) is prosecuting
the forfeiture case with substantial assistance from former MLARS Trial Attorney Marie M. Dalton, now an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Western
District of Washington.

Law enforcement authorities in Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, France, Ireland, Isle of Man, Latvia, Luxembourg, Norway, the Netherlands,
Switzerland, Sweden and the United Kingdom have provided valuable assistance in this case. The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International
Affairs provided significant assistance as well. The SEC referred the matter to the Department and also provided extensive cooperation and
assistance.

The Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice
Department's FCPA enforcement efforts can be found at www. justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Thursday, December 29, 2016

General Cable Corporation Agrees to Pay $20 Million Penalty for Foreign Bribery Schemes in Asia
and Africa

General Cable Corporation, a Kentucky-based manufacturer and distributor of cable and wire, entered into a non-prosecution agreement and
agreed to pay a $20 million penalty, reflecting a 50 percent reduction off the bottom of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines fine range, to resolve the
governmentâs investigation into improper payments to government officials in Angola, Bangladesh, China, Indonesia and Thailand to corruptly
gain business in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), announced Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of the Criminal
Division and Assistant Director Stephen Richardson of the FBIâs Criminal Investigative Division.

âGeneral Cable paid bribes to officials in multiple countries in a scheme that involved a high-level executive of the company and resulted in
profits of more than $50 million worldwide,â said Assistant Attorney General Caldwell. âBut General Cable also voluntarily self-disclosed this
misconduct to the government, fully cooperated and remediated. This resolution demonstrates the very real upside to coming in and
cooperating with federal prosecutors and investigators. It also reflects our ongoing commitment to transparency.â

âIn 2015, International Corruption Squads across the country were formed to address the national and international implications of foreign
corruption,â said Assistant Director Richardson. âThis settlement is an example of the exceptional efforts of those dedicated squads and
investigators. The FBI looks forward to continuing to work with our law enforcement partners to address corruption, no matter how big or
small.â

According to General Cableâs admissions, some parent-level and subsidiary-level employees, including executives, knew that some of its foreign
subsidiaries used third-party agents and distributors to make corrupt payments to foreign officials in order to obtain and retain business. In one
case the foreign subsidiary made corrupt payments directly to foreign officials. The corrupt conduct began in 2002. In 2011, when employees
from a General Cable subsidiary expressed concerns to regional and parent-level executives that commission payments were being used for
improper purposes, including potentially bribery, General Cable nevertheless failed to implement and maintain a system of internal accounting
controls designed to detect and prevent such corruption and otherwise illegal payments.

According to admissions by General Cable made in connection with the resolution, these payments were discussed openly in email messages.
For example, in June 2012, a sales agent in Bangladesh emailed an executive and other employees of General Cableâs subsidiary in Thailand
and said that a portion of the money that the Thailand subsidiary paid the sales agent would âbe shared by decision makers in [the] customer,
concerned higher ups in [the] Ministry[,] and some top executives at [the] bidder.â In May 2013, the executive, who had become an executive
at General Cable in December 2012, approved a payment to the Bangladeshi sales agent. In addition, in 2011, the same executive, who was at
that time working at General Cableâs Thailand subsidiary, informed a General Cable executive that payments to a distributor in Thailand were
being used for corrupt purposes. General Cable did not investigate those payments, which continued to be made.

Between 2002 and 2013, General Cable subsidiaries paid approximately $13 million to third-party agents and distributors, a portion of which
was used to make unlawful payments to obtain business, ultimately netting the company approximately $51 million in profits.

General Cable entered into a non-prosecution agreement and agreed to pay a criminal penalty of $20,469,694.80 to resolve the matter. As part
of the agreement, General Cable has agreed to continue to cooperate with the department in any ongoing investigations and prosecutions
relating to the conduct, including of individuals, to enhance its compliance program and to report to the department on the implementation of
its enhanced compliance program.

The department reached this resolution based on a number of factors, including that General Cable voluntarily and timely disclosed the conduct
at issue, fully cooperated in the investigation and fully remediated. General Cableâs cooperation included conducting a thorough internal
investigation; making regular factual presentations and proactively providing updates to the Fraud Section; voluntarily making foreign-based
employees available for interviews in the United States; producing documents, including translations, to the Fraud Section from foreign
countries in ways that did not implicate foreign data privacy laws; collecting, analyzing and organizing voluminous evidence and information for
the Fraud Section; identifying, investigating and disclosing conduct to the Fraud Section that was outside the scope of its initial voluntary self-
disclosure; and, by the conclusion of the investigation, providing to the Fraud Section all relevant facts known to it, including information about
individuals and third parties involved in the misconduct. General Cable also took extensive remedial measures, including taking employment
action against 13 employees who participated in the misconduct, resulting in their departure from the company, and terminating its
relationships with 47 third-party agents and distributors who participated in the misconduct. Based on these actions and other considerations,
the company received a non-prosecution agreement and an aggregate discount of 50 percent off of the bottom of the U.S. Sentencing
Guidelines fine range.

In related proceedings, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a cease and desist order against General Cable, whereby
General Cable agreed to pay approximately $55 million in disgorgement to the SEC, including prejudgment interest. Thus, the combined
penalties and disgorgement paid by General Cable is approximately $75.75 million. The Fraud Section appreciates the cooperation and
assistance provided by the SEC in this matter.

The FBI's International Corruption Squad in Washington, D.C., investigated the case. The department appreciates the cooperation and
assistance provided by the U.S. Attorneyâs Office of the Eastern District of Kentucky in this matter. Trial Attorneys Christopher Cestaro and
Lorinda Laryea of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section prosecuted the case. The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs also provided
substantial assistance in this matter.
The Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the
departmentâs FCPA enforcement efforts can be found at www. justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.

For example, in June 2012, a sales agent in Bangladesh emailed an executive and other employees of General Cableâs subsidiary in Thailand and said that a portion of the money that the Thailand subsidiary paid the sales agent would âbe shared by decision makers in [the] customer, concerned higher ups in [the] Ministry[,] and some top executives at [the] bidder.â In May 2013, the executive, who had become an executive at General Cable in December 2012, approved a payment to the Bangladeshi sales agent. In addition, in 2011, the same executive, who was at that time working at General Cableâs Thailand subsidiary, informed a General Cable executive that payments to a distributor in Thailand were being used for corrupt purposes. General Cable did not investigate those payments, which continued to be made.

Between 2002 and 2013, General Cable subsidiaries paid approximately $13 million to third-party agents and distributors, a portion of which was used to make unlawful payments to obtain business, ultimately netting the company approximately $51 million in profits.

General Cable entered into a non-prosecution agreement and agreed to pay a criminal penalty of $20,469,694.80 to resolve the matter. As part of the agreement, General Cable has agreed to continue to cooperate with the department in any ongoing investigations and prosecutions relating to the conduct, including of individuals, to enhance its compliance program and to report to the department on the implementation of its enhanced compliance program.

The department reached this resolution based on a number of factors, including that General Cable voluntarily and timely disclosed the conduct at issue, fully cooperated in the investigation and fully remediated. General Cableâs cooperation included conducting a thorough internal investigation; making regular factual presentations and proactively providing updates to the Fraud Section; voluntarily making foreign-based employees available for interviews in the United States; producing documents, including translations, to the Fraud Section from foreign countries in ways that did not implicate foreign data privacy laws; collecting, analyzing and organizing voluminous evidence and information for the Fraud Section; identifying, investigating and disclosing conduct to the Fraud Section that was outside the scope of its initial voluntary self- disclosure; and, by the conclusion of the investigation, providing to the Fraud Section all relevant facts known to it, including information about individuals and third parties involved in the misconduct. General Cable also took extensive remedial measures, including taking employment action against 13 employees who participated in the misconduct, resulting in their departure from the company, and terminating its relationships with 47 third-party agents and distributors who participated in the misconduct. Based on these actions and other considerations, the company received a non-prosecution agreement and an aggregate discount of 50 percent off of the bottom of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines fine range.

In related proceedings, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a cease and desist order against General Cable, whereby General Cable agreed to pay approximately $55 million in disgorgement to the SEC, including prejudgment interest. Thus, the combined penalties and disgorgement paid by General Cable is approximately $75.75 million. The Fraud Section appreciates the cooperation and assistance provided by the SEC in this matter.

The FBI's International Corruption Squad in Washington, D.C., investigated the case. The department appreciates the cooperation and assistance provided by the U.S. Attorneyâs Office of the Eastern District of Kentucky in this matter. Trial Attorneys Christopher Cestaro and Lorinda Laryea of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section prosecuted the case. The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs also provided substantial assistance in this matter.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Friday, July 28, 2017

Chairman of a Macau Real Estate Development Company Convicted on All Counts for Role in
Scheme to Bribe United Nations Ambassadors to Build a Multi-Billion Dollar Conference Center

Yesterday, a federal jury convicted the chairman of a real estate development company for his role in a scheme to bribe United Nations
ambassadors to obtain support to build a conference center in Macau that would host, among other events, the annual United Nations Global
South-South Development Expo.

Acting Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Blanco of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, Acting U.S. Attorney Joon H. Kim of the
Southern District of New York, Assistant Director in Charge William F. Sweeney, Jr. of the FBIâs New York Field Office and Chief Don Fort of
Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation (IRS-Cl) made the announcement.

After a four week trial, Ng Lap Seng, a/k/a âDavid Ng,â 69, of Macau, China, was convicted of two counts of violating the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act, one count of paying bribes and gratuities, one count of money laundering and two counts of conspiracy. No sentencing date has
been set.

âThe defendantâs corrupt activities were all the more egregious and shameful as he tried to hide his bribes as philanthropy,â said Acting
Assistant Attorney General Blanco. âCorruption is a disease that has a corrosive effect on the rule of law everywhere and harms good people
throughout the world. The Department is steadfast in its mission to aggressively investigate and prosecute bribery in all its forms, and
vigorously protect the rule of law.â

âIn his unbridled pursuit of even greater personal fortune, billionaire Ng Lap Seng corrupted the highest levels of the United Nations,â said
Acting U.S. Attorney Kim. âThrough bribes and no show jobs, Ng turned leaders of the league of nations into his private band of profiteers. Ngâs
journey from a Macau real estate mogul to convicted felon should serve as a cautionary tale to all tempted to follow his path. If you bring
corruption to New York - whether to the State Capitol in Albany or to the halls of the U.N. General Assembly - your journey may very well end in
a Manhattan federal courtroom, with a unanimous jury announcing your guilt.â

âNgâs bribery scheme began at the intersection where business and intergovernmental matters overlap,â said Assistant Director in Charge
Sweeney, Jr. He may have thought this was a good place to start, but itâs doubtful this was the ending he had in mind. This case is nothing more
than an example of corruption in its purest form, and weâve proven once again that no individual or organization is powerful enough to be
immune from prosecution.â

âToday's conviction is a result of untangling a global labyrinth of complex financial transactions used by Ng to facilitate bribes to foreign
officials,â said Chief Fort. âIRS-Cl has become a trusted leader in pursuit of those who use corruption as their business model to circumvent the
law. Cl is committed to maintaining fair competition, free of corrupt practices, through a dynamic synthesis of global teamwork and our robust
financial investigative talents.â

According to the evidence presented at trial, Ng, the chairman of the Sun Kian Ip Group, conspired with and paid bribes to Francis Lorenzo, a
former UN Ambassador from the Dominican Republic, and John W. Ashe, the late former Permanent Representative of Antigua and Barbuda to
the UN and the 68th President of the UN General Assembly (âUNGAâ). With the assistance of Jeff C. Yin, an accountant and co-conspirator who
worked with Ng and others and previously pleaded guilty, Ng orchestrated a scheme with the principal objective of obtaining the formal support
of the UN for a multi-billion dollar facility that Ng hoped to build in Macau using the Sun Kian Ip Group (the âMacau Conference Centerâ). Ng
wanted the Macau Conference Center to serve as a location for meetings, discussions, forums, and other events associated with the UN. In
particular, he wanted it to serve as the permanent home of the annual âGlobal South-South Development Expo,â which is run by the UN Office
for South-South Cooperation, and is hosted in a different country or city every year.

The trial evidence further showed that Ng bribed Ambassador Ashe and Ambassador Lorenzo (together, the âAmbassadorsâ) in exchange for
their agreement to use their official positions to advance Ngâs interest in obtaining formal UN support for the Macau Conference Center. As the
evidence demonstrated at trial, Ng paid the Ambassadors in a variety of forms. For example, Ng appointed Ambassador Lorenzo as the
President of South-South News, a New York-based organization â funded by Ng â which described itself as a media platform dedicated to
advancing the implementation of the UNâs Millennium Development Goals, a set of philanthropic goals. Ng provided bribe payments to
Ambassador Lorenzo through South-South News by transmitting payments from Macau to a company in the Dominican Republic affiliated with
Ambassador Lorenzoâs brother (the âDominican Companyâ). Through South-South News, Ng also made payments to Ambassador Ashe,
including to Ambassador Asheâs wife, who was paid in her capacity as a âconsultantâ to South-South News, and to an account that Ambassador
Ashe had established, purportedly to raise money for his role as President of UNGA. Ng also provided bribes through cash and wire payments to
the Ambassadors.

According to the trial evidence, one of the actions that the Ambassadors took in exchange for bribe payments, to advance Ngâs objectives, was
to submit an official document to the then-UN Secretary-General in support of the Macau Conference Center (the âUN Documentâ). The UN
Document claimed that there was a need to build the Macau Conference Center to support the UNâs global development goals. Ambassador
Ashe, aided by Ambassador Lorenzo, initially submitted the UN Document to the UNGA in or about late February 2012. More than a year later,
at Ngâs behest, the Ambassadors revised the UN Document to refer specifically to Ngâs company, the Sun Kian Ip Group, as a partner in the
Macau Conference Center project. The UN Document requested that the Secretary-General circulate the UN Document âas a document of the
sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly,â under a specific item of the official UNGA agenda. The Secretary-General followed this request,
thereby making the UN Document an official part of the UNGA record.
Five other defendants have been charged in this matter. Co-conspirators Lorenzo, Yin and Heidi Hong Piao have pleaded guilty and are awaiting
sentencing. Shiwei Yan has pleaded and was sentenced to 20 months in prison. Co-defendant Ashe passed away in 2016 and the charges
against him were dismissed.

This case was investigated by the FBI and IRS-ClI. Trial Attorney David A. Last of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S.
Attorneys Daniel C. Richenthal, Janis M. Echenberg and Douglas S. Zolkind of the Southern District of New York are prosecuting the case.

Och-Ziff Capital Management Admits to Role in Africa Bribery Conspiracies and Agrees to Pay
$213 Million Criminal Fine

Och-Ziff Enters into Three-Year Deferred Prosecution Agreement; Subsidiary Pleads Guilty to Conspiracy to Violate the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act

A New York-based alternative investment and hedge fund manager, Och-Ziff Capital Management Group LLC (Och-Ziff), and its wholly-owned
subsidiary, OZ Africa Management GP LLC (OZ Africa), entered into resolutions to resolve criminal charges and agreed to pay a criminal penalty
of more than $213 million in connection with a widespread scheme involving the bribery of officials in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
and Libya.

Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General David Bitkower of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Robert L. Capers of the
Eastern District of New York, Assistant Director in Charge William F. Sweeney Jr. of the FBIâs New York Field Office and Chief Richard Weber of
the Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation (IRS-Cl) New York Field Office made the announcement.

âThis case marks the first time a hedge fund has been held to account for violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act,â said Principal Deputy
Assistant Attorney General Bitkower. âIn its pursuit of profits, Och-Ziff and its agents paid millions in bribes to high-level officials across Africa.
By exposing corruption in this industry, the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section continues to root out wrongdoing of all types in the financial
sector.â

âOch-Ziff, one of the largest hedge funds, positioned itself to profit from the corruption that is sadly endemic in certain parts of Africa, including
in Libya, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Chad and Niger,â said U.S. Attorney Capers. âDespite knowing that bribes were being paid to
senior government officials, Och-Ziff repeatedly funded corrupt transactions. One Och-Ziff employee was so bold as to order the removal of
language from their African joint ventureâs internal audit report that called for an investigation of suspected bribery payments by a business
partner. Todayâs corporate resolutions, which include a more than $213 million criminal penalty and an independent compliance monitor, hold
Och-Ziff accountable for placing profits above the law and will help ensure that the conduct brought to light here never happens again at this
company.â

âGaining the upper hand in a business venture by engaging in corrupt practices is bribery in its purest form,â said Assistant Director in Charge
Sweeney. âDoing so with the intention of influencing a foreign official in his or her capacity is nothing short of corruption. In this scheme,
payments of millions of dollars were paid out to senior officials within certain parts of Africa in exchange for access to profitable investment
opportunities. This type of behavior canât and won't be tolerated. | commend the investigators and prosecutors who continue to work together
at home and abroad to vigorously enforce the law within the confines of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.â

âToday's plea and deferred prosecution agreement result from the unraveling of complex financial transactions orchestrated by Och-Ziff Capital
Management Group LLC and its subsidiary to facilitate illegal payments to foreign government officials,â said Chief Weber. âIRS-ClI will continue
to investigate pervasive bribery schemes used by corporations in the pursuit of attractive international investment opportunities.â

Och-Ziff entered into a deferred prosecution agreement in connection with a criminal information charging the company with two counts of
conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), one count of falsifying its books and records and
one count of failing to implement adequate internal controls. Pursuant to its agreement with the department, Och-Ziff agreed to pay a total
criminal penalty of $213,055,689. Och-Ziff also agreed to implement rigorous internal controls, retain a compliance monitor for a term of three
years and cooperate fully with the departmentâs ongoing investigation, including its investigation of individuals.

OZ Africa pleaded guilty to a one-count criminal information filed today and assigned to U.S. District Judge Nicholas G. Garaufis of the Eastern
District of New York, charging the company with a conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA. Sentencing has been scheduled
for March 29, 2017.

In related proceedings, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a cease and desist order against Och-Ziff Capital Management
Group LLC and OZ Management LP, whereby Och-Ziff agreed to pay approximately $199 million in disgorgement to the SEC, including
prejudgment interest. Thus, the combined total amount of U.S. criminal and regulatory penalties paid by Och-Ziff is approximately $412 million.

The DRC Bribery Scheme

According to the companiesâ admissions, in late 2007, Och-Ziff employees began discussions with a businessman operating in the DRC about
entering into a partnership based on special access to lucrative investment opportunities in the DRC involving the countryâs diamond and
mining sectors. Och-Ziff employees learned that the businessman gained access to these attractive investment opportunities by making
corrupt payments to senior government officials in the DRC, the companies admitted. According to the plea agreement, between 2008 and
2012, Och-Ziff entered into several DRC-related transactions in conjunction with the businessman, understanding that Och-Ziffâs funds would be
used, in part, to pay substantial sums of money to high-ranking DRC officials to secure access to, and preference for, the investment
opportunities. In late 2008, after an Och-Ziff employee was alerted that an audit of the businessman's records revealed payments to DRC
officials, that employee instructed that any references to those payments be removed from a final report of the audit, the companies admitted.
According to the plea agreement, the businessman paid tens of millions of dollars in bribes to DRC officials in exchange for investment
opportunities that resulted in more than $90 million in profits for Och-Ziff.
The Libya Bribery Scheme

Och-Ziff also admitted that, beginning in 2007, it engaged a third-party agent to assist the company in securing an investment from the Libyan
Investment Authority (LIA), that countryâs sovereign wealth fund, knowing the agent would need to pay bribes to Libyan officials. The agent was
engaged without formal approval or any due diligence, according to court documents. The company admitted that, beginning in February 2007,
the agent worked on behalf of Och-Ziff to obtain an asset placement from the LIA, including setting up a meeting between a senior Och-Ziff
employee and the Libyan official empowered to make investment decisions for the LIA. According to court documents, in late November 2007,
Och-Ziff received a $300 million investment from the LIA into the companyâs hedge funds. Och-Ziff admitted that it subsequently entered into
an agreement to pay the agent a âfinderâs feeâ of $3.75 million, knowing that all or a portion of the fees would be paid to Libyan officials in
return for their assistance in obtaining the LIAâs investment. In addition, Och-Ziff admitted that it falsified its books and records and attempted
to conceal and disguise the bribes paid through the agent by paying the âfinderâs feeâ through a sham consulting agreement.

Internal Controls Failures and Falsified Books and Records

Och-Ziff also failed to implement and maintain adequate internal accounting controls, which allowed its employees, agents and business
partners to misappropriate assets, the company admitted. As a result of its failure to conduct due diligence on its partners and the lack of
financial controls, Och-Ziff failed to prevent bribe payments from being made in the DRC, Libya, as well as in Chad and Niger, where an Och-Ziff
joint venture made mining-related investments, according to admissions in court documents.

The Corporate Resolutions

The department entered into this resolution in part due to Och-Ziffâs failure to voluntarily self-disclose the companiesâ misconduct to the
department. The resolution also reflects the seriousness of the companiesâ conduct, including the high value of the bribes paid to foreign
officials and the involvement of a high level employee within Och-Ziff. Notwithstanding, the criminal penalty reflects a 20 percent reduction off
the bottom of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines fine range because of Och-Ziffâs cooperation with the governmentâs investigation.

* * *

In connection with the governmentâs investigation, Samuel Mebiame, 43, a Gabonese national, was charged on Aug. 16, 2016, with conspiring
to bribe foreign government officials to obtain mining rights in Chad, Niger and Guinea. According to the criminal complaint, Mebiame allegedly
worked as a âfixerâ for a mining company owned by a joint venture between Och-Ziff and an entity incorporated in Turks and Caicos. The
complaint alleges that Mebiame paid bribes to high-ranking government officials in Niger and Chad to obtain mining rights for the joint venture.
The charges against Mebiame are merely allegations, and he is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.

The FBI's New York Field Office and IRS-Clâs New York office are investigating the case. The department appreciates the significant cooperation
and assistance provided by the SEC in this matter. The Swiss Federal Office of Justice, the British Virgin Islands Central Authority, the Maltese
judicial authorities and authorities in Jersey and Guernsey also provided assistance.

Assistant Deputy Chief Leo Tsao and Trial Attorney James P. McDonald of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys
James P. Loonam, Jonathan P. Lax and David Pitluck of the Eastern District of New Yorkâs Business and Securities Fraud Section are prosecuting
the case. The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs also provided significant assistance.

In related proceedings, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a cease and desist order against Och-Ziff Capital Management Group LLC and OZ Management LP, whereby Och-Ziff agreed to pay approximately $199 million in disgorgement to the SEC, including prejudgment interest. Thus, the combined total amount of U.S. criminal and regulatory penalties paid by Och-Ziff is approximately $412 million.

The DRC Bribery Scheme
According to the companiesâ admissions, in late 2007, Och-Ziff employees began discussions with a businessman operating in the DRC about entering into a partnership based on special access to lucrative investment opportunities in the DRC involving the countryâs diamond and mining sectors. Och-Ziff employees learned that the businessman gained access to these attractive investment opportunities by making corrupt payments to senior government officials in the DRC, the companies admitted. According to the plea agreement, between 2008 and 2012, Och-Ziff entered into several DRC-related transactions in conjunction with the businessman, understanding that Och-Ziffâs funds would be used, in part, to pay substantial sums of money to high-ranking DRC officials to secure access to, and preference for, the investment opportunities. In late 2008, after an Och-Ziff employee was alerted that an audit of the businessman's records revealed payments to DRC officials, that employee instructed that any references to those payments be removed from a final report of the audit, the companies admitted.
According to the plea agreement, the businessman paid tens of millions of dollars in bribes to DRC officials in exchange for investment opportunities that resulted in more than $90 million in profits for Och-Ziff.

The Libya Bribery Scheme
Och-Ziff also admitted that, beginning in 2007, it engaged a third-party agent to assist the company in securing an investment from the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA), that countryâs sovereign wealth fund, knowing the agent would need to pay bribes to Libyan officials. The agent was engaged without formal approval or any due diligence, according to court documents. The company admitted that, beginning in February 2007, the agent worked on behalf of Och-Ziff to obtain an asset placement from the LIA, including setting up a meeting between a senior Och-Ziff employee and the Libyan official empowered to make investment decisions for the LIA. According to court documents, in late November 2007, Och-Ziff received a $300 million investment from the LIA into the companyâs hedge funds. Och-Ziff admitted that it subsequently entered into an agreement to pay the agent a âfinderâs feeâ of $3.75 million, knowing that all or a portion of the fees would be paid to Libyan officials in return for their assistance in obtaining the LIAâs investment. In addition, Och-Ziff admitted that it falsified its books and records and attempted to conceal and disguise the bribes paid through the agent by paying the âfinderâs feeâ through a sham consulting agreement.

Internal Controls Failures and Falsified Books and Records
Och-Ziff also failed to implement and maintain adequate internal accounting controls, which allowed its employees, agents and business partners to misappropriate assets, the company admitted. As a result of its failure to conduct due diligence on its partners and the lack of financial controls, Och-Ziff failed to prevent bribe payments from being made in the DRC, Libya, as well as in Chad and Niger, where an Och-Ziff joint venture made mining-related investments, according to admissions in court documents.

The Corporate Resolutions
The department entered into this resolution in part due to Och-Ziffâs failure to voluntarily self-disclose the companiesâ misconduct to the department. The resolution also reflects the seriousness of the companiesâ conduct, including the high value of the bribes paid to foreign officials and the involvement of a high level employee within Och-Ziff. Notwithstanding, the criminal penalty reflects a 20 percent reduction off the bottom of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines fine range because of Och-Ziffâs cooperation with the governmentâs investigation.

* * *
In connection with the governmentâs investigation, Samuel Mebiame, 43, a Gabonese national, was charged on Aug. 16, 2016, with conspiring to bribe foreign government officials to obtain mining rights in Chad, Niger and Guinea. According to the criminal complaint, Mebiame allegedly worked as a âfixerâ for a mining company owned by a joint venture between Och-Ziff and an entity incorporated in Turks and Caicos. The complaint alleges that Mebiame paid bribes to high-ranking government officials in Niger and Chad to obtain mining rights for the joint venture.
The charges against Mebiame are merely allegations, and he is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.

The FBI's New York Field Office and IRS-Clâs New York office are investigating the case. The department appreciates the significant cooperation and assistance provided by the SEC in this matter. The Swiss Federal Office of Justice, the British Virgin Islands Central Authority, the Maltese judicial authorities and authorities in Jersey and Guernsey also provided assistance.

Assistant Deputy Chief Leo Tsao and Trial Attorney James P. McDonald of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys James P. Loonam, Jonathan P. Lax and David Pitluck of the Eastern District of New Yorkâs Business and Securities Fraud Section are prosecuting the case.

Former Embraer Sales Executive Pleads Guilty to Foreign Bribery and Related Charges

A former sales executive of Embraer S.A. (Embraer), a Brazilian-based manufacturer of aircraft, pleaded guilty today in connection with a
scheme to pay bribes to a high-level foreign government official in exchange for assistance in securing Embraerâs sale of aircraft to Saudi
Arabiaâs national oil company.

Acting Assistant Attorney General John P. Cronan of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, Acting U.S. Attorney Joon H. Kim of the Southern
District of New York, Assistant Director Stephen E. Richardson of the FBIâs Criminal Investigative Division and Special Agent in Charge Robert F.
Lasky of the FBIâs Miami Field Office made the announcement.

Colin Steven, 61, a U.K. citizen residing in the United Arab Emirates, was charged by information filed today in the Southern District of New York
with one count of violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA, one count of wire fraud, one
count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, one count of money laundering, one count of conspiracy to launder money and one count of making a
false statement. Steven pleaded guilty to all of those counts before U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan of the Southern District of New York. A
sentencing date has not been scheduled yet. The Court set a control date of June 21, 2018.

As part of his plea, Steven, a former vice president of sales & marketing in Embraerâs Executive Jets Division, admitted that he engaged ina
scheme to have Embraer pay bribes to a foreign official in exchange for assistance in getting an aircraft sales contract with favorable terms
awarded to Embraer; retained a kickback as part of the scheme; and lied to law enforcement officials about his kickback.

Steven consented to the filing of the information, which alleged that Embraer was in negotiations with Saudi Arabiaâs national oil company over
a potential aircraft sale when Steven and the foreign official devised an arrangement whereby the foreign official would guarantee that Embraer
would win a contract and that the contract would involve new rather than used aircraft in exchange for approximately $1.5 million in bribe
payments. In early 2010, Saudi Arabiaâs national oil company awarded Embraer a contract for three new aircraft, valued at approximately $93
million. The information further alleged that he arranged to disguise the bribes as commissions to a South African company that was owned in
part by Steven's personal friends. The South African company transferred the bulk of the bribe proceeds to the foreign officialâs intermediary
but, at Stevenâs direction, paid a portion of the bribe proceeds to Steven.

In pleading guilty, Steven admitted that he executed, and conspired with others to execute, the bribery and kickback schemes; laundered and
conspired to launder the proceeds of those schemes through the South African company and lied to U.S. law enforcement about the kickback.

The guilty plea entered today follows the execution in October 2016 of a deferred prosecution agreement between the Department and
Embraer, under which Embraer agreed to pay a $107 million penalty to the Department as part of a $205 million global resolution to
investigations by the Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission and Brazilian authorities related to corrupt conduct in several
countries, including Saudi Arabia. The agreement acknowledged Embraerâs cooperation with the investigations. With the cooperation of U.S.
authorities, Brazilian authorities have charged 11 individuals for their alleged involvement in Embraerâs misconduct in the Dominican Republic.
Saudi Arabian authorities have charged two individuals for their alleged involvement in Embraerâs misconduct in Saudi Arabia.

The FBI's International Corruption Squads, based in Miami, Florida, and Los Angeles, California, investigated the case. Trial Attorneys John-Alex
Romano and Nikhila Raj and Assistant Chief David Johnson of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Cooper
of the Southern District of New York, are prosecuting the case. The Fraud Section appreciates the cooperation and assistance provided by the
SEC in this matter.

The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs provided significant assistance in this matter. The Department also appreciates the
cooperation and assistance provided by authorities in Brazil, the Dominican Republic, South Africa and Switzerland in this matter.

In 2015, the FBI formed International Corruption Squads across the country to address national and international implications of foreign
corruption.

Former President of Transportation Company Found Guilty of Violating the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act and Other Crimes

The former president of Transportation Logistics Inc. (TLI), a Maryland-based transportation company that provides services for the
transportation of nuclear materials to customers in the United States and abroad, was found guilty today for his role in a scheme to bribe an
official at a subsidiary of Russiaâs State Atomic Energy Corporation and on related fraud and conspiracy charges.

Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Department's Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Robert K. Hur of the District of
Maryland and Assistant Director in Charge Timothy R. Slater of the FBIâs Washington Field Office and Inspector General Teri L. Donaldson of the
U.S. Department of Energyâs Office of Inspector General (DOE-OIG) made the announcement.

After a three-week trial, Mark Lambert, 56, of Mount Airy, Maryland, was found guilty of four counts of violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act (FCPA), two counts of wire fraud, and one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA and commit wire fraud. Sentencing has been scheduled
for March 9, 2020, before U.S. District Judge Theodore D. Chuang of the District of Maryland, who presided over the trial.

According to the evidence presented at trial, Lambert participated in a scheme to bribe Vadim Mikerin, a Russian official at JSC Techsnabexport
(TENEX), a subsidiary of Russiaâs State Atomic Energy Corporation and the sole supplier and exporter of Russian Federation uranium and
uranium enrichment services to nuclear power companies worldwide, in order to secure contracts with TENEX. The trial evidence demonstrated
that, over the course of years, Lambert conspired with others at TLI to make the corrupt and fraudulent bribery and kickback payments to
Mikerin through offshore bank accounts associated with shell companies, at Mikerinâs direction. In order to conceal the bribe payments,
Lambert and his co-conspirators caused fake invoices to be prepared, purportedly from TENEX to TLI, that described services that were never
provided, and then Lambert and others caused TLI to wire the corrupt payments for those purported services to shell companies in Latvia,
Cyprus and Switzerland.

The trial evidence further showed that Lambert and other members of the conspiracy used code words like âlucky figures,â âLF,â âlucky
numbersâ and âcakeâ to describe the payments in emails to the Russian official at an alias, personal email account under the name âMarvin
Jodel.â The evidence at trial also demonstrated that Lambert and his co-conspirators caused TLI to overbill TENEX by building the cost of the
bribe payments into their invoices, and TENEX thus overpaid for TLIâs services in order to fund the bribes paid to Mikerin.

This case is being investigated by the FBIâs Washington Field Office and DOE-OIG. Assistant Chief Vanessa A. Sisti and Trial Attorney Derek J.
Ettinger of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney David |. Salem of the District of Maryland are prosecuting the case.

Chairman of Macau Real Estate Development Company Sentenced to Prison for Role in Scheme to
Bribe United Nations Ambassadors to Build A Multi-Billion Dollar Conference Center

The chairman of a real estate development company was sentenced today to 48 months in prison and three years of supervised release for his
role in a scheme to bribe United Nations ambassadors to obtain support to build a conference center in Macau that would host, among other
events, the annual United Nations Global South-South Development Expo.

Acting Assistant Attorney General John P. Cronan of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman of the
Southern District of New York, Assistant Director in Charge William F. Sweeney Jr. of the FBIâs New York Field Office and Special Agent in Charge
James D. Robnett of the IRS Criminal Investigationâs (IRS-Cl) New York Field Office made the announcement.

Ng Lap Seng, aka âDavid Ng,â 69, of Macau, China, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Vernon S. Broderick of the Southern District of New
York. In addition to his prison sentence, Judge Broderick ordered Ng to pay a $1 million fine and $302, 977 in restitution to the United Nations.
He also ordered a forfeiture money judgment of $1.5 million in forfeiture. Ng must report to the U.S. Marshals Service by July 10 to start his
prison sentence. Ng was convicted on July 27, 2017, after a five-week trial of two counts of violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, one
count of paying bribes and gratuities, one count of money laundering and two counts of conspiracy.

âCorruption at any level of government undermines the rule of law and cannot be tolerated,â said Acting Assistant Attorney General Cronan.
âBut corruption is especially corrosive when it occurs at an international body like the United Nations. By paying bribes to two U.N.
ambassadors to advance his interest in obtaining formal support for the Macau conference center project, Ng Lap Seng tried to manipulate the
functions of the United Nations. The sentence handed down today demonstrates that those who engage in corruption will pay a heavy price
and serves as a reminder that no one stands above the law.â

âBillionaire Ng Lap Seng corrupted the highest levels of the United Nations in pursuit of a multibillion-dollar real estate deal in Macau,â said U.S.
Attorney Berman. âNg exploited a center for international diplomacy as an instrument for his greedy intentions. This Office is committed to
policing official corruption wherever it may be found.â

âGaining the upper hand in a business venture by engaging in corrupt practices is bribery in its purest form. Today, Ng Lap Seng has learned
the price he will have to pay for his actions,â said Assistant Director in Charge Sweeney. â| commend the investigators and prosecutors who
continue to work together at home and abroad to vigorously enforce the law within the confines of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.â

âNo matter if money is funneled through New York corporations or transferred offshore, IRS-Cl is always ready to follow the money,â said IRS-Cl
Special Agent-in-Charge Robnett. âTodayâs sentencing shows that IRS-Cl is committed to rooting out public corruption by investigating
individuals who misuse their positions of public trust for personal financial gain.â

According to the evidence presented at trial, Ng, the chairman of the Sun Kian Ip Group, conspired with and paid bribes to Francis Lorenzo, a
former UN Ambassador from the Dominican Republic, and John W. Ashe, the late former Permanent Representative of Antigua and Barbuda to
the UN and the 68th President of the UN General Assembly (UNGA). With the assistance of Jeff C. Yin, an accountant and co-conspirator who
worked with Ng and others and previously pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud the United States, Ng orchestrated a scheme with the
principal objective of obtaining the formal support of the UN for a multi-billion dollar facility that Ng hoped to build in Macau using the Sun Kian
Ip Group (the âMacau Conference Centerâ). Ng wanted the Macau Conference Center to serve as a location for meetings, discussions, forums,
and other events associated with the UN. In particular, he wanted it to serve as the permanent home of the annual âGlobal South-South
Development Expo,â which is run by the UN Office for South-South Cooperation, and is hosted in a different country or city every year.

The trial evidence showed that Ng bribed Ambassador Ashe and Ambassador Lorenzo (together, the âAmbassadorsâ) in exchange for their
agreement to use their official positions to advance Ngâs interest in obtaining formal UN support for the Macau Conference Center. As the
evidence demonstrated at trial, Ng paid the Ambassadors in a variety of forms. For example, Ng appointed Ambassador Lorenzo as the
President of South-South News, a New York-based organization â funded by Ng â which described itself as a media platform dedicated to
advancing the implementation of the UNâs Millennium Development Goals, a set of philanthropic goals. Ng provided bribe payments to
Ambassador Lorenzo through South-South News by transmitting payments from Macau to a company in the Dominican Republic affiliated with
Ambassador Lorenzoâs brother (the âDominican Companyâ). Through South-South News, Ng also made payments to Ambassador Ashe,
including to Ambassador Asheâs wife, who was paid in her capacity as a âconsultantâ to South-South News, and to an account that Ambassador
Ashe had established, purportedly to raise money for his role as President of UNGA.

According to the trial evidence, one of the actions that the Ambassadors took in exchange for bribe payments, to advance Ngâs objectives, was
to submit an official document to the then-UN Secretary-General in support of the Macau Conference Center (the âUN Documentâ). The UN
Document claimed that there was a need to build the Macau Conference Center to support the UNâs global development goals. Ambassador
Ashe, aided by Ambassador Lorenzo, initially submitted the UN Document to the UNGA in or about late February 2012. More than a year later,
at Ngâs behest, the Ambassadors revised the UN Document to refer specifically to Ngâs company, the Macau Real Estate Development
Company, as a partner in the Macau Conference Center project. The UN Document requested that the Secretary-General circulate the UN
Document âas a document of the 66"" session of the General Assembly,â under a specific item of the official UNGA agenda. The Secretary-
General followed this request, thereby making the UN Document an official part of the UNGA record.

Five other defendants have been charged in this matter. Lorenzo and Heidi Hong Piao pleaded guilty to various charges, including bribery, and
are awaiting sentencing. Jeff C. Yin pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the United States and was sentenced to seven months in prison.
Shiwei Yan pleaded guilty to bribery and was sentenced to 20 months in prison. Co-defendant Ashe passed away in 2016 and the charges
against him were dismissed.

This case was investigated by the FBI and IRS-Cl. The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs provided significant assistance.
Assistant Chief David A. Last of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Daniel C. Richenthal, Janis M. Echenberg, and
Douglas S. Zolkind of the Southern District of New York are prosecuting the case.

The Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice
Department's FCPA enforcement efforts can be found at www. justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.

âBillionaire Ng Lap Seng corrupted the highest levels of the United Nations in pursuit of a multibillion-dollar real estate deal in Macau,â said U.S.
Attorney Berman. âNg exploited a center for international diplomacy as an instrument for his greedy intentions. This Office is committed to policing official corruption wherever it may be found.â
âGaining the upper hand in a business venture by engaging in corrupt practices is bribery in its purest form. Today, Ng Lap Seng has learned the price he will have to pay for his actions,â said Assistant Director in Charge Sweeney. â| commend the investigators and prosecutors who continue to work together at home and abroad to vigorously enforce the law within the confines of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.â
âNo matter if money is funneled through New York corporations or transferred offshore, IRS-Cl is always ready to follow the money,â said IRS-Cl Special Agent-in-Charge Robnett. âTodayâs sentencing shows that IRS-Cl is committed to rooting out public corruption by investigating individuals who misuse their positions of public trust for personal financial gain.â
According to the evidence presented at trial, Ng, the chairman of the Sun Kian Ip Group, conspired with and paid bribes to Francis Lorenzo, a former UN Ambassador from the Dominican Republic, and John W. Ashe, the late former Permanent Representative of Antigua and Barbuda to the UN and the 68th President of the UN General Assembly (UNGA). With the assistance of Jeff C. Yin, an accountant and co-conspirator who worked with Ng and others and previously pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud the United States, Ng orchestrated a scheme with the principal objective of obtaining the formal support of the UN for a multi-billion dollar facility that Ng hoped to build in Macau using the Sun Kian Ip Group (the âMacau Conference Centerâ). Ng wanted the Macau Conference Center to serve as a location for meetings, discussions, forums, and other events associated with the UN. In particular, he wanted it to serve as the permanent home of the annual âGlobal South-South Development Expo,â which is run by the UN Office for South-South Cooperation, and is hosted in a different country or city every year.

The trial evidence showed that Ng bribed Ambassador Ashe and Ambassador Lorenzo (together, the âAmbassadorsâ) in exchange for their agreement to use their official positions to advance Ngâs interest in obtaining formal UN support for the Macau Conference Center. As the evidence demonstrated at trial, Ng paid the Ambassadors in a variety of forms. For example, Ng appointed Ambassador Lorenzo as the President of South-South News, a New York-based organization â funded by Ng â which described itself as a media platform dedicated to advancing the implementation of the UNâs Millennium Development Goals, a set of philanthropic goals. Ng provided bribe payments to Ambassador Lorenzo through South-South News by transmitting payments from Macau to a company in the Dominican Republic affiliated with
Ambassador Lorenzoâs brother (the âDominican Companyâ). Through South-South News, Ng also made payments to Ambassador Ashe, including to Ambassador Asheâs wife, who was paid in her capacity as a âconsultantâ to South-South News, and to an account that Ambassador Ashe had established, purportedly to raise money for his role as President of UNGA.

According to the trial evidence, one of the actions that the Ambassadors took in exchange for bribe payments, to advance Ngâs objectives, was to submit an official document to the then-UN Secretary-General in support of the Macau Conference Center (the âUN Documentâ). The UN Document claimed that there was a need to build the Macau Conference Center to support the UNâs global development goals. Ambassador Ashe, aided by Ambassador Lorenzo, initially submitted the UN Document to the UNGA in or about late February 2012. More than a year later, at Ngâs behest, the Ambassadors revised the UN Document to refer specifically to Ngâs company, the Macau Real Estate Development Company, as a partner in the Macau Conference Center project. The UN Document requested that the Secretary-General circulate the UN Document âas a document of the 66"" session of the General Assembly,â under a specific item of the official UNGA agenda. The Secretary- General followed this request, thereby making the UN Document an official part of the UNGA record.

Five other defendants have been charged in this matter. Lorenzo and Heidi Hong Piao pleaded guilty to various charges, including bribery, and are awaiting sentencing. Jeff C. Yin pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the United States and was sentenced to seven months in prison.
Shiwei Yan pleaded guilty to bribery and was sentenced to 20 months in prison. Co-defendant Ashe passed away in 2016 and the charges against him were dismissed.

This case was investigated by the FBI and IRS-Cl. The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs provided significant assistance.
Assistant Chief David A. Last of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Daniel C. Richenthal, Janis M. Echenberg, and Douglas S. Zolkind of the Southern District of New York are prosecuting the case.

The Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice Department's FCPA enforcement efforts can be found at www. justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Thursday, January 12, 2017

Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc. Agrees to Pay $17.4 Million to Resolve Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
Charges

Subsidiary Agrees to Plead Guilty to Violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act

Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc. (Zimmer Biomet), an Indiana-based manufacturer of orthopedic and dental implant devices, has agreed to pay a
$17.4 million criminal penalty in connection with a scheme to pay bribes to government officials in Mexico and for violations of the internal
controls provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) involving the companyâs operations in Mexico and Brazil. Zimmer Biomet had
been in breach of a 2012 deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with the department resolving an earlier investigation into FCPA violations
committed by Biomet Inc., which became part of Zimmer Biomet in 2015.

Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division and Assistant Director Stephen Richardson of the
FBIâs Criminal Investigative Division made the announcement.

âZimmer Biomet had the opportunity to avoid criminal charges but its misconduct allowed the bribes to continue,â said Assistant Attorney
General Caldwell. âZimmer Biomet is now paying the price for disregarding its obligations under the earlier deferred prosecution agreement. In
appropriate circumstances the department will resolve serious criminal conduct through alternative means, but there will be consequences for
those companies that refuse to take these agreements seriously.â

âZimmer Biomet failed to rectify their misconduct and get back on track in compliance with the law, and now they are facing the consequences
of their corrupt actions,â said Assistant Director Richardson. âThe FBI will not stand idly by when companies operate outside the law and
attempt to play by different rules in the marketplace. We remain vigilant and committed to holding those accountable who disregard the rule of
law in the United States.â

According to admissions made in the resolution documents, even after the 2012 DPA between the department and Biomet, the company
knowingly and willfully continued to use a third-party distributor in Brazil known to have paid bribes to government officials on Biometâs behalf.
Biomet also failed to implement an adequate system of internal accounting controls at the companyâs subsidiary in Mexico, despite employees
and executives having been made aware of red flags suggesting that bribes were being paid. By failing to require appropriate due diligence and
documentation and contracts for payments to third parties, Biomet allowed its Mexican subsidiary, Biomet 3i Mexico S.A. de C.V. (3i Mexico), to
pay bribes to Mexican customs officials through customs brokers and sub-agents so 3i Mexico could import contraband dental implants into
Mexico. Importing those products into Mexico violated Mexican law because they lacked proper registration or labeling.

Zimmer Biomet entered into a three-year DPA tin connection with a superseding criminal information, filed today in the District of Columbia,
charging the company with failing to implement a system of effective internal accounting controls. Pursuant to its agreement with the
department, Zimmer Biomet agreed to pay a $17.4 million criminal penalty and retain an independent corporate compliance monitor for three
years.

JERDS Luxembourg Holding S.ar.|. JERDS), an indirect subsidiary of Zimmer Biomet, agreed to plead guilty to a one-count criminal information,
also filed in the District of Columbia, charging it with causing Biomet to violate the books and records provisions of the FCPA through the actions
of 3i Mexico, a wholly-owned subsidiary of JERDS. The plea agreement is subject to court approval. The case was assigned to Senior U.S. District
Judge Reggie B. Walton of the District of Columbia and the change of plea is scheduled to take place on Jan. 13, 2017 at 3:45 p.m.

In related proceedings, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a cease and desist order against Zimmer Biomet whereby the
company agreed to pay to the SEC disgorgement of $6.5 million including pre-judgment interest and $6.5 million as a civil penalty.

The Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section reached this resolution based on a number of factors, including that Zimmer Biomet was in breach of the
2012 DPA between Biomet and the department. That agreement resolved an earlier investigation by the department into violations of the FCPA
committed by Biomet, including the bribery of government officials in Argentina, Brazil and China as well as the falsification of the companyâs
financial records to conceal the true nature of the bribe payments. Pursuant to the 2012 DPA, Biomet had been required to retain an
independent compliance monitor. The monitorâs term was extended for one year in 2015, due to both the bribery in Brazil and Mexico and the
fact that the Zimmer Biomet compliance program did not meet the requirements of the 2012 DPA. At the conclusion of the extended period, the
independent monitor was unable to certify that the companyâs compliance program satisfied the requirements of the 2012 DPA and the
department notified Zimmer Biomet that it was deemed to be in breach of the agreement. Zimmer Biomet fully cooperated with the current
investigation and provided to the Fraud Section all relevant facts known to the company, including information about individuals involved in the
misconduct. Nevertheless, because Zimmer Biomet failed to implement an effective compliance program and committed additional crimes
while under a DPA and monitorship, the current DPA requires Zimmer Biomet retain an independent compliance monitor for a term of three
years.

The FBI's International Corruption Squad in Washington, D.C., investigated the case. Assistant Chief Tarek J. Helou and Trial Attorney John
Borchert of the Fraud Section prosecuted the case. The Office of International Affairs also provided substantial assistance in this matter.

The Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the

departmentâs FCPA enforcement efforts can be found at www. justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.

Five Individuals Charged in Foreign Bribery Scheme Involving Rolls-Royce Plc and Its U.S.
Subsidiary

Charges were unsealed today against two former executives of Rolls-Royce plc and its subsidiaries (Rolls-Royce), a former Rolls-Royce
employee, a former intermediary for Rolls-Royce in Kazakhstan and an executive of an international engineering consulting firm - all for their
alleged participation in a scheme to pay bribes to foreign government officials for the benefit of a U.S.-based Rolls-Royce subsidiary, including
to secure a contract to supply equipment and services to power a gas pipeline from Central Asia to China.

Acting Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Blanco of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Benjamin C. Glassman of the
Southern District of Ohio, Inspector in Charge Regina Faulkerson of the U.S. Postal Inspection Serviceâs Criminal Investigations Group, Assistant
Director Stephen E. Richardson of the FBIâs Criminal Investigative Division and Assistant Director in Charge Andrew W. Vale of the FBIâs
Washington Field Office made the announcement.

Petros Contoguris, 70, a citizen of Greece residing in Turkey, was charged by an indictment filed in the Southern District of Ohio on Oct. 12, and
unsealed today, with one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), one count of conspiracy to launder money,
seven counts of violating the FCPA and 10 counts of money laundering. Contoguris is believed to be outside of the United States. James Finley,
66, a citizen of the United Kingdom residing in Taiwan, pleaded guilty on July 28, before Chief Judge Edmund A. Sargus Jr. of the Southern
District of Ohio, to one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA and one count of violating the FCPA. Aloysius Johannes Jozef Zuurhout, 53, of the
Netherlands; Andreas Kohler, 53, of Austria; and Keith Barnett, 48, of Houston, Texas, each pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate
the FCPA before Chief Judge Sargus on June 13; June 6; and Dec. 20, 2016, respectively.

âThe charges announced today against executives, employees, and third parties affiliated with Rolls-Royce, is another example of the Criminal
Divisionâs commitment to holding individuals - and not just corporations - accountable for violating the FCPA,â said Acting Assistant Attorney
General Blanco. âThanks to the coordinated efforts by our prosecutors and agents - working closely with their counterparts in Brazil and at the
United Kingdomâs Serious Fraud Office, among others - these defendants, many of whom reside overseas, will face justice in this case, which
represents another important step towards leveling the playing field for all ethical and honest businesses.â

âThe charges unsealed today reflect the determination and ability of the United States to investigate and prosecute individuals who engage in
foreign corrupt business practices, regardless of how sophisticated or far-flung the scheme may be,â said U.S. Attorney Glassman. âWe can and
will follow the evidence wherever it leads - from Columbus to Kazakhstan and beyond.â

âThis type of sophisticated fraud scheme can cause immeasurable economic losses to competitive markets around the world,â said Inspector in
Charge Faulkerson. âAnyone who engages in deceptive practices should know they will not go undetected and will be held accountable. The
U.S. Postal Inspection Service has an extensive history of successfully investigating complex fraud and corruption cases. The collaborative
investigative work conducted by Postal Inspectors and our domestic and international law enforcement partners illustrates our efforts to protect
the United States and the international marketplace.â

âTodayâs indictment and guilty pleas reveal that those associated with this corruption did knowingly conspire to break the law for their own
personal gain,â said Assistant Director Richardson. âNo one is above the law, so let todayâs announcement be a warning to those who may try to
perpetrate a similar scheme that the FBI will aggressively pursue those who attempt to bribe foreign officials for an unfair advantage in the
global marketplace.â

âTodayâs charges demonstrate the immense capabilities of the FBIâs Washington Field Office international corruption program and the global
impact of the anti-corruption program,â said Assistant Director in Charge Vale. âThe FBI is committed to holding accountable those who disrupt
the level playing field to which companies in the United States and around the world are entitled.â

According to the indictment and informations unsealed today, Contoguris, the founder and chief executive officer of Gravitas & CIE.
International Ltd. (Gravitas); Finley, a former senior executive in energy at Rolls-Royce; Barnett, a former regional director in energy at Rolls-
Royce; Zuurhout, a former energy sales employee at Rolls-Royce; and Kohler, a managing director at an international engineering and
consulting firm, and others, allegedly conspired to pay bribes to foreign officials in exchange for directing business to Rolls-Royce Energy
Systems Inc. (RRESI). RRESI was a U.S.-based indirect subsidiary of Rolls-Royce plc, the United Kingdom-based manufacturer and distributor of
power systems for the aerospace, defense, marine and energy sectors.

The indictment alleges that Contoguris, working with employees of an international engineering consulting firm (Technical Advisor), including
Kohler, devised a scheme with Rolls-Royce executives and employees, including Zuurhout, Barnett and Finley, whereby Rolls-Royce would pay
kickbacks to the Technical Advisor employees, and bribes to at least one foreign official, and disguise these payments as commissions to
Contogurisâs company, Gravitas, in exchange for helping Rolls-Royce win contracts with Asia Gas Pipeline LLP (AGP).

According to the indictment, AGP was created to build and connect a gas pipeline between Central Asia and China, and the Technical Advisor
purported to provide independent engineering consulting advice and other services to AGP. The indictment further alleges that after AGP
awarded Rolls-Royce a contract in November 2009, worth approximately $145 million, Rolls-Royce made commission payments to Gravitas, and
Contoguris then passed a portion of those commission payments onto the Technical Advisor employees knowing that they would share that
money with a foreign official consistent with their corrupt agreement.

In pleading guilty, Finley, Barnett and Zuurhout admitted that they each participated in a conspiracy, going as far back as approximately 1999
and continuing into 2013, to engage commercial advisors who would use their commission payments from Rolls-Royce to bribe foreign officials
in a number of countries to help Rolls-Royce secure an improper advantage and obtain and retain business with foreign governments and
instrumentalities across the globe.

The charges announced today follow the announcement on Jan. 17, of a deferred prosecution agreement with Rolls-Royce plc and a more than
$800 million total penalty as part of a global resolution to investigations by the Department of Justice and U.K. and Brazilian authorities related
to the corrupt conduct. The agreement acknowledged Rolls-Royceâs cooperation in this case, including with the Departmentâs investigation into
individuals, and significant remedial measures.

An indictment is merely an allegation and all defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a
court of law.

The U.S. Postal Inspection Service and the FBI's International Corruption Squad in Washington, D.C., investigated the case. In 2015, the FBI
formed International Corruption Squads across the country to address national and international implications of foreign corruption. Trial
Attorneys Kevin R. Gingras and Vanessa Snyder and Assistant Chief Ephraim Wernick of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section, and Assistant U.S.
Attorneys Michael J. Marous and Jessica Kim of the Southern District of Ohio are prosecuting the case.

The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs provided significant assistance in this matter. The United Kingdomâs Serious Fraud Office
provided significant cooperation and assistance in this matter, as did law enforcement colleagues in Brazil, which both coordinated with the
Department to reach simultaneous resolutions with Rolls-Royce. The Department also thanks its law enforcement colleagues in Austria,
Germany, the Netherlands, Singapore and Turkey.

The Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice
Department's FCPA enforcement efforts can be found at www. justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Thursday, May 24, 2018

Former Armenian Ambassador and a Russian National Charged in Foreign Bribery and Money
Laundering Scheme

Two employees of an international engineering consulting firm were charged in a superseding indictment filed today for their alleged
participation in a scheme to launder bribe payments to foreign government officials for the benefit of a Columbus, Ohio-based subsidiary of
Rolls-Royce plc, to secure a contract to supply equipment and services to power a gas pipeline from Kazakhstan to China.

Acting Assistant Attorney General John P. Cronan of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Benjamin C. Glassman of the
Southern District of Ohio, Acting Inspector in Charge Nicole Davis of the U.S. Postal Inspection Serviceâs Criminal Investigations Group, Assistant
Director Christopher Hacker of the FBIâs Criminal Investigative Division and Special Agent in Charge Matthew J. DeSarno of the FBIâs Washington
Field Office Criminal Division made the announcement.

Azat Martirossian, 62, a citizen of Armenia, and Vitaly Leshkov, 50, a citizen of Russia, were charged by a superseding indictment filed in the
Southern District of Ohio with one count of conspiracy to launder money and 10 counts of money laundering. Petros Contoguris, 70, a citizen of
Greece, was also charged on these counts, as well as one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), and seven
counts of violating the FCPA. Contoguris previously had been charged on all of these counts in an indictment that was filed on Oct. 12, 2017
and unsealed on Nov. 7, 2017. Martirossian, Leshkov, and Contoguris are believed to be residing outside the United States.

âThe charges announced today against Azat Martirossian and Vitaly Leshkov further demonstrate the Criminal Divisionâs unwavering resolve to
prosecute those who facilitate corruption and launder illicit proceeds,â said Acting Assistant Attorney General Cronan. âThanks to the
coordinated efforts by our prosecutors and agentsâworking closely with their counterparts throughout the worldâthese defendants will face
prosecution for their allegedly corrupt schemes.â

âThe charges filed today reflect the continued determination of the United States to prosecute those who engage in foreign corrupt business
practices,â said U.S. Attorney Glassman. âInternational actors should think twice before executing bribery schemes because the United States
can and will discover and prosecute such schemes and their perpetrators.â

âThe U.S. Postal Inspection Service has a long history of successfully investigating complex fraud and corruption cases,â said Acting Inspector in
Charge Davis. âCorruption and bribery schemes such as this involving international corporations and conspirators are not victimless crimes.
This type of conduct can damage competitive domestic and international markets, and cause immeasurable economic losses both here in the
United States and around the world. Anyone who engages in deceptive practices like this should know they will not go undetected and will be
held accountable, regardless of where they are. The collaborative investigative work on this case conducted by Postal Inspectors and our
domestic and international law enforcement partners illustrates our efforts to protect the United States and the international marketplace.â

âThe allegations outlined today exemplify how a small group of individuals, who knowingly engage in illegal payments in an attempt to advance
businesses dealings, create an uneven global marketplace,â said Acting Assistant Director Hacker. âThe FBI with our partners continues to work
these important cases in order to remove the notion that bribery, through backroom deals, is an acceptable way of doing business. This
investigation demonstrates the importance of international cooperation amongst law enforcement in combatting fraud and money laundering
ona global basis.â

âTodayâs charges serve as a reminder of the important role the FBI plays in rooting out international corruption,â said FBI Special Agent in
Charge DeSarno. âNo one is above the law, so let todayâs announcement be a warning to those who may try to perpetrate a similar scheme
that the FBI will work with global partners in its mission to detect and prevent corrupt business practices, and we will continue to hold those who
attempt to take advantage of international markets accountable.â

According to the superseding indictment, Contoguris, the founder and chief executive officer of Gravitas & CIE. International Ltd. (Gravitas),
former Rolls-Royce employees and executives, and others, allegedly conspired to pay bribes to foreign officials in exchange for directing
business to Rolls-Royce Energy Systems Inc. (RRESI). RRESI was a U.S.-based subsidiary of Rolls-Royce plc, the United Kingdom-based global
manufacturer and distributor of power systems for the aerospace, defense, marine and energy sectors.

The superseding indictment alleges that Contoguris, working with employees of an international engineering consulting firm (Technical Advisor),
including Martirossian and Leshkov, devised and executed a scheme with Rolls-Royce executives and employees, whereby Rolls-Royce would
pay kickbacks to the Technical Advisor employees and bribes to at least one foreign official in Kazakhstan, and disguise these payments as
commissions to Contogurisâs company, Gravitas, in exchange for helping Rolls-Royce win contracts with Asia Gas Pipeline LLP (AGP).

According to the superseding indictment, AGP was created to build and connect a gas pipeline between Central Asia and China, and the
Technical Advisor purported to provide independent engineering consulting advice and other services to AGP. The superseding indictment
further alleges that after AGP awarded Rolls-Royce a contract in November 2009, worth approximately $145 million, Rolls-Royce made
commission payments to Gravitas, and Contoguris then passed a portion of those commission payments onto the Technical Advisor employees,
including Leshkov and Martirossian, knowing that a portion of that money would be shared with a foreign official consistent with their corrupt
agreement.

The charges announced today follow the Jan. 17, 2017 announcement of a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with Rolls-Royce plc and a
more than $800 million total penalty as part of a global resolution to investigations by the Department of Justice, U.K., and Brazilian authorities
related to the corrupt conduct. The charges also follow upon the Nov. 7, 2017 announcement, concerning Rolls-Royce former executives and
employees James Finley, Keith Barnett and Louis Zuurhout, and Technical Advisor employee Andreas Kohler, each of whom have entered guilty
pleas in connection with their respective roles in the bribery scheme. The DPA acknowledged Rolls-Royceâs cooperation in this case, including
with the Departmentâs investigation into individuals, and significant remedial measures.

An indictment is merely an allegation and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of
law.

The U.S. Postal Inspection Service and the FBI's International Corruption Squad in Washington, D.C., investigated the case. Trial Attorneys Kevin
R. Gingras and Vanessa Snyder of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys J. Michael Marous and Jessica Kim of the
Southern District of Ohio are prosecuting the case.

",--ERROR--,"May 24, 2018",Former Armenian Ambassador and a Russian National Charged in Foreign Bribery and Money Laundering Scheme.,"Two employees of an international engineering consulting firm were charged in a superseding indictment filed today for their alleged participation in a scheme to launder bribe payments to foreign government officials for the benefit of a Columbus, Ohio-based subsidiary of Rolls-Royce plc, to secure a contract to supply equipment and services to power a gas pipeline from Kazakhstan to China.

Acting Assistant Attorney General John P. Cronan of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Benjamin C. Glassman of the Southern District of Ohio, Acting Inspector in Charge Nicole Davis of the U.S. Postal Inspection Serviceâs Criminal Investigations Group, Assistant Director Christopher Hacker of the FBIâs Criminal Investigative Division and Special Agent in Charge Matthew J. DeSarno of the FBIâs Washington Field Office Criminal Division made the announcement.

Azat Martirossian, 62, a citizen of Armenia, and Vitaly Leshkov, 50, a citizen of Russia, were charged by a superseding indictment filed in the Southern District of Ohio with one count of conspiracy to launder money and 10 counts of money laundering. Petros Contoguris, 70, a citizen of Greece, was also charged on these counts, as well as one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), and seven counts of violating the FCPA. Contoguris previously had been charged on all of these counts in an indictment that was filed on Oct. 12, 2017 and unsealed on Nov. 7, 2017. Martirossian, Leshkov, and Contoguris are believed to be residing outside the United States.

âThe charges announced today against Azat Martirossian and Vitaly Leshkov further demonstrate the Criminal Divisionâs unwavering resolve to prosecute those who facilitate corruption and launder illicit proceeds,â said Acting Assistant Attorney General Cronan. âThanks to the coordinated efforts by our prosecutors and agentsâworking closely with their counterparts throughout the worldâthese defendants will face prosecution for their allegedly corrupt schemes.â
âThe charges filed today reflect the continued determination of the United States to prosecute those who engage in foreign corrupt business practices,â said U.S. Attorney Glassman. âInternational actors should think twice before executing bribery schemes because the United States can and will discover and prosecute such schemes and their perpetrators.â
âThe U.S. Postal Inspection Service has a long history of successfully investigating complex fraud and corruption cases,â said Acting Inspector in Charge Davis. âCorruption and bribery schemes such as this involving international corporations and conspirators are not victimless crimes.
This type of conduct can damage competitive domestic and international markets, and cause immeasurable economic losses both here in the United States and around the world. Anyone who engages in deceptive practices like this should know they will not go undetected and will be held accountable, regardless of where they are. The collaborative investigative work on this case conducted by Postal Inspectors and our domestic and international law enforcement partners illustrates our efforts to protect the United States and the international marketplace.â
âThe allegations outlined today exemplify how a small group of individuals, who knowingly engage in illegal payments in an attempt to advance businesses dealings, create an uneven global marketplace,â said Acting Assistant Director Hacker. âThe FBI with our partners continues to work these important cases in order to remove the notion that bribery, through backroom deals, is an acceptable way of doing business. This investigation demonstrates the importance of international cooperation amongst law enforcement in combatting fraud and money laundering ona global basis.â
âTodayâs charges serve as a reminder of the important role the FBI plays in rooting out international corruption,â said FBI Special Agent in Charge DeSarno. âNo one is above the law, so let todayâs announcement be a warning to those who may try to perpetrate a similar scheme that the FBI will work with global partners in its mission to detect and prevent corrupt business practices, and we will continue to hold those who attempt to take advantage of international markets accountable.â
According to the superseding indictment, Contoguris, the founder and chief executive officer of Gravitas & CIE. International Ltd. (Gravitas), former Rolls-Royce employees and executives, and others, allegedly conspired to pay bribes to foreign officials in exchange for directing business to Rolls-Royce Energy Systems Inc. (RRESI). RRESI was a U.S.-based subsidiary of Rolls-Royce plc, the United Kingdom-based global manufacturer and distributor of power systems for the aerospace, defense, marine and energy sectors.

The superseding indictment alleges that Contoguris, working with employees of an international engineering consulting firm (Technical Advisor), including Martirossian and Leshkov, devised and executed a scheme with Rolls-Royce executives and employees, whereby Rolls-Royce would pay kickbacks to the Technical Advisor employees and bribes to at least one foreign official in Kazakhstan, and disguise these payments as commissions to Contogurisâs company, Gravitas, in exchange for helping Rolls-Royce win contracts with Asia Gas Pipeline LLP (AGP).

According to the superseding indictment, AGP was created to build and connect a gas pipeline between Central Asia and China, and the Technical Advisor purported to provide independent engineering consulting advice and other services to AGP. The superseding indictment further alleges that after AGP awarded Rolls-Royce a contract in November 2009, worth approximately $145 million, Rolls-Royce made commission payments to Gravitas, and Contoguris then passed a portion of those commission payments onto the Technical Advisor employees, including Leshkov and Martirossian, knowing that a portion of that money would be shared with a foreign official consistent with their corrupt agreement.

The charges announced today follow the Jan. 17, 2017 announcement of a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with Rolls-Royce plc and a more than $800 million total penalty as part of a global resolution to investigations by the Department of Justice, U.K., and Brazilian authorities
related to the corrupt conduct. The charges also follow upon the Nov. 7, 2017 announcement, concerning Rolls-Royce former executives and employees James Finley, Keith Barnett and Louis Zuurhout, and Technical Advisor employee Andreas Kohler, each of whom have entered guilty pleas in connection with their respective roles in the bribery scheme. The DPA acknowledged Rolls-Royceâs cooperation in this case, including with the Departmentâs investigation into individuals, and significant remedial measures.

An indictment is merely an allegation and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.

The U.S. Postal Inspection Service and the FBI's International Corruption Squad in Washington, D.C., investigated the case. Trial Attorneys Kevin R. Gingras and Vanessa Snyder of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys J. Michael Marous and Jessica Kim of the Southern District of Ohio are prosecuting the case.

The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs provided significant assistance in this matter. The United Kingdomâs Serious Fraud Office provided assistance in this matter, as did law enforcement colleagues in Brazil, which both coordinated with the Department to reach simultaneous resolutions with Rolls-Royce. The Department also thanks its law enforcement colleagues in Austria, the Bahamas, Germany, the Netherlands, Singapore, Switzerland and Turkey.
