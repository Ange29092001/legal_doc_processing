Commission,
PLAINTIFF
V. ORDER
Robert S. Leben and Amy L. Leben,
DEFENDANTS","This matter comes before the Court on Plaintiff U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission’s (CFTC) motion for summary judgment, ECF No. 25, and Defendants Robert and
Amy Leben’s cross-motion for summary judgment, ECF No. 33. After careful consideration of
the applicable law, the evidence submitted by the parties, and the conduct to which Robert Leben
pled guilty in a related criminal case, the CFTC’s motion is granted and the Lebens’ cross-motion
is denied.
FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
In January 2014, the CFTC filed this lawsuit seeking a permanent injunction, civil
monetary penalty, restitution, and disgorgement of funds against the Lebens based on their
operation of a Ponzi scheme that defrauded twelve investors of more than $2,000,000. ECF No.
1. Specifically, the CFTC alleges the Lebens, through their company Structured Finance Group
(SFG), ran a fraudulent commodity pool in violation of certain provisions of the Commodity
Exchange Act (CEA) 7 U.S.C. §§ I et seg., and certain CFTC Regulations found at 17 C.F.R. §§
1.1 et seg. Id.
At the outset of the proceedings, the Court granted the CFTC’s motion for a temporary
restraining order and, thereafter, granted the parties’ consent motion for a preliminary injunction."
