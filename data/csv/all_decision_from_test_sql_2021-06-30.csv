Colliers’ internal accounting controls, fabricated documents, created fictitious email messages, and
lied to Colliers executives. Among other actions, Bahn falsely represented that the foreign

If entered by the court, the proposed judgment will require Defendant to forgive all of its outstanding loans—approximately $330 million in debt– for about 35,000 borrowers who currently have outstanding principal balances.

The CFPB’s complaint against Defendant alleged that ITT arranged for the Defendant's loans to be serviced and collected on after ITT had induced its students to take out the loans by a variety of unfair practices, including rushing students through financial aid appointments, using aggressive tactics, and in some cases, gaining unauthorized access to student accounts to sign students up for loans without permission.
