CFTC Orders Merrill Lynch Commodities, Inc. to Pay Approximately $25 Million for
Spoofing, Manipulation, and Attempted Manipulation in Precious Metals Futures

Washington, DC - The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today issued an Order filing and simultaneously
settling charges against Merrill Lynch Commodities, Inc. (MLCI), a provisionally registered swap dealer, for spoofing,
manipulation, and attempted manipulation over a six-year period with respect to certain precious metals futures
contracts traded on the Commodity Exchange, Inc. (COMEX).

The CFTC Order imposes monetary sanctions totaling approximately $25 million, which includes a civil monetary penalty
of $11.5 million dollars, over $2.3 million in restitution, and disgorgement of $11.1 million. The Order also requires MLCI
to cooperate with the CFTC in matters related to this action and the underlying conduct, and to comply with certain
obligations in connection with its corporate compliance program and reporting requirements.

CFTCâs Director of Enforcement Comments

James McDonald, CFTC Director of Enforcement, stated: âTodayâs enforcement action shows that the Commission
continues to aggressively pursue those who manipulate and spoof in our markets. If left unchecked, this sort of
misconduct can undermine the integrity of the price discovery process, harm law-abiding market participants, and
diminish confidence in our markets more generally. Thatâs why we will continue to keep our markets free from spoofing
and manipulation.â

The Order specifically finds that during the period from at least 2008 through 2014 certain traders at MLCI (Traders)
placed orders to buy and sell precious metals futures contracts with the intent to cancel the orders before execution.
According to the Order, the Tradersâ spoofing strategy frequently involved placing a relatively small bid or offer with the
intent to execute that order (the Genuine Order) and, prior to the execution of the Genuine Order, placing a larger order
(or multiple orders) on the opposite side of the same market with the intent to cancel the order or orders before
execution (the Spoof Order). Generally, the Traders would receive a partial or complete fill of the Genuine Order and
cancel the Spoof Order before it was filled. The Order further finds that the Traders engaged in this conduct with the
intent to manipulate market prices and ultimately did cause artificial prices. Moreover, as the Order finds, on occasion,
certain Traders acknowledged spoofing to affect prices. For example, in a November 16, 2010 electronic chat, a Trader
stated:

âguys the algos are really geared up in here. [I]f you spoof this it really moves... .â
The Order recognizes that MLCI provided substantial cooperation to CFTCâs Division of Enforcement which resulted in a
substantially reduced civil monetary penalty.

Today, the US Department of Justice also announced that the Fraud Section of the Criminal Division has entered into a
Non-Prosecution Agreement with MLCI in a parallel matter. Under the terms of the agreement, MLCI has agreed, among
other things, to pay $25 million, which represents the combined appropriate criminal fine, forfeiture, and restitution
amounts in that matter, to cooperate fully with the Fraud Section in any and all matters relating to the underlying
conduct, and to comply with certain obligations in connection with its corporate compliance program and reporting
requirements.

The CFTC thanks and acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation.

This case is brought in connection with the CFTC Division of Enforcementâs Spoofing Task Force, and the staff members
responsible for this matter are Brandon Wozniak, Lara Turcik, Candice Aloisi, Lenel Hickson, Jr., and Manal M. Sultan.

CFTC Orders Glencore Agriculture B.V. and Glencore Ltd. to Pay a $2 Million Penalty for
Exceeding Cotton Futures Position Limits, Transacting Illegal EFPs, and Submitting
Inaccurate Form 304s

Cotton Trading by Glencore Agriculture B.V. and Glencore Ltd. Was under Common Control
by Head of Glencore Cotton Trading

Washington, DC - The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today issued an order filing and settling charges
against Glencore Agriculture B.V., f/k/a Glencore Grain B.V. (Glencore B.V.), located in Rotterdam, the
Netherlands, and Glencore Ltd., located in Stamford, Connecticut, finding that on multiple trading days during May
2013, June 2013, May 2014, and June 2014, Glencore B.V. and Glencore Ltd. held net positions in the ICE Futures Cotton
No. 2 contracts (cotton futures) that, on an aggregated basis, exceeded the speculative position limits established by the
CFTC. In addition, the CFTC Order finds that on twenty-four occasions between January 2013 and November 2015,
Glencore B.V. and Glencore Ltd. executed exchange of futures for physical transactions (EFPs) opposite each otherâs
cotton futures trading accounts, even though their accounts were not independently controlled as required for such
transactions not to constitute illegal wash trades. And, on at least two occasions in 2013 and 2014, Glencore B.V.
submitted to the CFTC a Form 304 that failed to represent accurately all required information, including its short cash
sales commitments, according to the CFTC Order.

The CFTC Order requires Glencore B.V. and Glencore Ltd., jointly and severally, to pay a $2 million civil monetary penalty
and to cease and desist from further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC Regulations, as charged.

According to the CFTC Order, at all times relevant to the Order, Glencore centralized the management of its global cotton
business under the direction of a single trading manager (referred to in the Order as Head of Cotton), who oversaw
cotton operations across all Glencore entities. The Head of Cotton directly supervised cotton traders at Glencore B.V. and
was also the direct supervisor of Glencore Ltd.âs head cotton trader.

The CEA and CFTC Regulations set limits on the net long or net short position that any person may hold or control for
certain commodities, including a limit of 5,000 cotton futures for a single month, other than the spot month, exclusive of
bona fide hedging transactions. The CFTC Order finds that because Glencore B.V. and Glencore Ltd. operated their
cotton trading under the common control of Glencoreâs Head of Cotton, their cotton futures positions should have been
aggregated for purposes of complying with the Commissionâs position limits. When aggregated, the cotton futures
positions of Glencore B.V. and Glencore Ltd. exceeded 5,000 net contracts, exclusive of bona fide hedging transactions,
on multiple days during May 2013, June 2013, May 2014, and June 2014.

The CEA and CFTC Regulations permit noncompetitive trading, such as EFPs, only if such transactions are conducted in
accordance with rules of an exchange, such as the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), that are approved by the CFTC. At all
times relevant to this Order, ICE rules permitted the transaction of EFPs between independently controlled accounts.
However, the CFTC Order finds that Glencore B.V.âs and Glencore Ltd.âs cotton futures trading accounts were both
ultimately controlled by Glencoreâs Head of Cotton. As a result they were not independently controlled. Nevertheless,
between January 2013 and November 2015, Glencore B.V. and Glencore Ltd. executed twenty-four EFPs opposite one
anotherâs accounts, according to the CFTC Order.

The Order further states that CFTC Regulations require cotton merchants and dealers holding or controlling reportable
futures positions to file a monthly Statement of Cash Positions in Cotton (Form 304), as of the close of business on the
last Friday of the month. On the Form 304, entities report the composition of their fixed price cash position in cotton and
cotton products, including the quantity of open fixed price purchase and fixed price sale commitments. The CFTC Order
finds that Glencore B.V. filed two erroneous Form 304 reports with the CFTCâone on May 31, 2013 and a second on May
30, 2014âthat overstated the quantities of its fixed price cotton cash positions.

The CFTC thanks and acknowledges the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets for its assistance in this matter.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this action are James Deacon, Ilana Waxman, Laura
Brookover, Kara Mucha, John Buffington, James H. Holl, Ill, and Rick Glaser. The Division of Enforcement would like to
recognize the assistance of other CFTC staff: Janet Briner, Kelly Beck, Harry Hild, and Matthew Hunter.

CFTC Orders Former Hedge Fund Portfolio Manager to Pay More than $700,000 in
Monetary Sanctions for Fraudulently Mismarking Swaps

Washington, DC â The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today issued an Order filing and settling
charges against Swapnil Rege, a former portfolio manager for a Connecticut-based hedge fund registered with the CFTC
as a commodity pool operator (CPO), for fraudulently mismarking swap valuations to artificially inflate the profits of his
employerâs trading book in order to obtain an increased performance bonus.

The Order requires Rege to pay a $100,000 civil monetary penalty, as well as to disgorge the $600,000 performance
bonus he received (plus pre-judgment interest in the amount of $49,170.84). It also bans Rege from trading on or subject
to the rules of any CFTC-registered exchange or other CFTC-registered entity and from seeking registration with the CFTC
for at least three years, among other prohibitions.

CFTC Director of Enforcement Comments

James McDonald, CFTCâs Director of Enforcement, said: âWith this action, the Commission shows its continued
commitment to holding accountable individuals who engage in fraudulent conduct that undermines the integrity of our
markets. This Order also reflects the CFTCâs continued commitment to working in parallel with our enforcement partners
like the Securities and Exchange Commission to ensure that bad actors are identified and held accountable, even when
their misconduct stretches across multiple regulatorsâ jurisdictions.â

The Fraudulent Mismarking Scheme

The Order finds that from in or about June 2016 through April 2017, Rege engaged in a fraudulent scheme to mismark
the valuations of certain interest rate swaps in an attempt to artificially inflate the profitability of his trading in order to
earn a larger performance bonus. Rege accomplished his mismarking scheme in several ways, including by manipulating
the discount curve settings of the valuation model used by the CPO to mark its swaps and other related instruments, and
by using incorrect day count settings for fixed and floating legs of some swaps and swaptions to reduce or increase the
model value of future payments to or by the CPO. The Order also finds that Rege took steps to conceal his mismarking
scheme, including by asking counterpart traders at swap dealers used by the CPO to provide him with quotes to verify
the fraudulent model valuations. The Order finds that this conduct constituted fraud under the federal commodities
laws.

Related SEC Action

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also announced today that it filed and settled a related action against
Rege for aiding and abetting violations of the Investment Advisers Act by the fundâs investment adviser (the CFTC-
registered CPO was also registered with the SEC as an investment adviser). The SEC Order imposes disgorgement and
pre-judgment interest in amounts identical to the CFTC Order, as well as a $100,000 civil monetary penalty;
disgorgement amounts paid pursuant to the SEC Order shall offset (dollar-for-dollar) Regeâs obligation to pay
disgorgement under the CFTC Order.

CFTC Wins Judgment against Commodities Trader for Commodity Pool Fraud, Including
Misappropriating Funds

Washington, DC â The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) announced today that Defendant Mark R.
Slobodnik of Libertyville, Illinois, has been ordered to pay approximately $370,000 in fines in connection with a $1.76
million commodity pool fraud operated under the name Blue Guru, LLC.

Judge Manish Shah, of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, entered a Consent Order for Permanent
Injunction on November 9, 2018 that requires Slobodnik to pay restitution totaling $280,000, disgorge $45,342.44 of ill-
gotten gains and pay a civil monetary penalty of $45,342.44. The Order also imposes a five year trading and registration
ban on Slobodnik and prohibits him from violating provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act as charged.

The Order stems from a CFTC Complaint filed on January 12, 2018 (see CFTC Complaint and Press Release 7672-18),
which charged Slobodnik, a former member of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), and co-defendants Richard D.
Carter and Blue Guru, LLC with fraud, misappropriation and failing to register with the CFTC. The Order finds that from
April 2014 to the filing of the Complaint, Slobodnik willfully misrepresented material facts to participants and prospective
participants of Blue Guru concerning the profits they were making on their participation interests in the commodity pool.
Among the misrepresentations, Slobodnik told prospective and actual participants that Blue Guru would use their money
to trade futures, including the Dow Jones E-mini and the S&P 500 E-mini contracts on the CME, when, in fact, the
defendants used less than two-thirds of the $1.76 million they solicited and received for trading. According to the Order,
Slobodnik informed prospective participants that they would earn 8 percent per year on their investment plus 50 percent
of any gross net trading profits, and was present or aware of communications advising participants that their funds were
earning consistent trading profits. In fact, the Order finds that Slobodnik was responsible for approximately $249,000 of
the $501,000 in trading losses incurred by Blue Guru.

The Order also finds that Slobodnik misappropriated $45,342.44 of participantsâ funds and that when participants
requested to withdraw their funds from Blue Guru, Slobodnik and his partner ignored their demands, engaged in delay
tactics, and lied about conditions that purportedly prevented them from making disbursements.

Earlier in the litigation, Judge Shah entered an Order for Injunction, Civil Monetary Penalties, And Other Statutory and
Equitable Relief Against Defendant Blue Guru, LLC by default on May 1, 2018 and ordered Blue Guru to pay restitution of
$1,400,076.78, disgorgement of $1,400,076.78 and a civil monetary penalty of $4,200,230.34. The case remains
pending against Carter.

The CFTC cautions that Orders requiring repayment of funds to victims may not result in the recovery of any money lost
because the wrongdoers may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the
protection of customers and to ensure the wrongdoers are held accountable.

The CFTC thanks the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Northern District of Illinois and the Federal Bureau of Investigation for
their assistance.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this action are Susan Gradman, Joseph Patrick, Brigitte
Weyls, Scott Williamson and Rosemary Hollinger.

CFTC Charges Forex Trader and Firm with Fraud and Registration Violations

Washington, DCâThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today filed a federal court enforcement action in
the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Jason Amada of New York, New York, and Amada
Capital Management LLC (ACM), a New York entity owned and controlled by Amada. The CFTC Complaint charges
that, from at least February 2014 through at least November 2015, the Defendants fraudulently solicited potential clients
to open individually managed trading accounts for off-exchange foreign currency contracts (forex) and hid substantial
trading losses incurred as a result of Defendantsâ managed forex trading.

Specifically, the Complaint alleges that the Defendants fraudulently solicited clients for these accounts by, among other
things, misrepresenting Defendantsâ forex trading experience and profitability. In addition, the Complaint alleges that
the Defendants made the false claim that they would implement a hedging strategy that would prevent losses of more
than one percent. As further alleged, Defendants attempted to conceal mounting losses by transferring some of their
commissions into a clientâs account. The Complaint also alleges that the Defendants failed to register with the CFTC as
required.

In its continuing litigation, the CFTC seeks civil monetary penalties, permanent registration and trading bans,
disgorgement, and a permanent injunction against further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC
Regulations, as charged.

Related Criminal Charges

Today, the New York State Office of the Attorney General announced a criminal indictment charging Amada with Grand
Larceny in the Second Degree and a violation of the Martin Act, a New York State statute that prohibits, among other
things, the fraudulent sale of commodities products.

The CFTC appreciates the cooperation and assistance of the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority and the New
York State Office of the Attorney General.

Peter Riggs, Joyce Brandt, Christopher Reed, and Charles Marvine.

Federal Court Orders Husband and Wife Team and Their Company to Pay Defrauded
Customers More Than $1 Million in Connection with a Futures Trading Scheme

Washington, DC â The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) announced today that on December 27, 2018 a
Washington State federal court ordered Bellevue, Washington residents Sung Hong a/k/a Lawrence Hong or
Laurence Hong, his wife, Hyun Joo Hong a/k/a/ Grace Hong, and their company Pishon Holding LLC to pay more
than $1.25 million in restitution in connection with an enforcement action brought by the CFTC charging the defendants
with fraudulent solicitation and misappropriation involving futures contracts. In addition to the restitution, the Court
Order also imposes a permanent trading and registration ban on the Hongs and Pishon and prohibits them from violating
provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) as charged.

The Courtâs Order stems from a CFTC Complaint filed on June 1, 2017 in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of
Washington. [See CFTC Press Release 7569-17]. In the Order, Judge Marsha Pechman found that the Hongs and Pishon
misappropriated $1,259,317.77 from their customers. Additionally, the court found that the Hongs and Pishon
fraudulently solicited more than $11 million dollars from customers for the purpose of trading futures contacts. The court
further found that the Hongs and Pishon lied about, about among other things how much money they had under
management; Laurence Hongâs prior trading success; and how trading fees would be deducted from customer accounts.
At the same time, the Court Order found, the Hongs and Pishon failed to tell customers that Laurence Hong had been
imprisoned previously for 33 months in connection with wire fraud charges.

In a parallel criminal case filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, Laurence Hong
and Grace Hong pleaded guilty on March 27, 2018 and March 30, 2018, respectively, to multiple criminal counts. See
Case No. CR17-163TSZ. On October 11, 2018, Laurence Hong was sentenced to a 180-month prison term and Grace
Hong was sentenced to a 72-month prison term. The court ordered that the defendants also pay restitution in the
criminal matter. In recognition of the prior restitution award in the criminal matter, Judge Pechman ordered that the
defendants may offset their civil restitution obligation with payments in the criminal matter on a one-to-one basis.

The CFTC cautions victims that restitution orders may not result in the recovery of money lost because the wrongdoers
may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers and to
ensure the wrongdoers are held accountable.

The Division of Enforcement thanks the United States Attorney for the Western District of Washington and the FBI for
their invaluable assistance and cooperation.

The CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Kevin Samuel, Ilana Waxman, Kim Bruno,
Alison Wilson, and Rick Glaser.

Washington, D.C. - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced the filing of a civil enforcement
action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Eyal Alper of Tarrytown, New York, for
fraud and misappropriating funds.

CFTC Charges 10 Commodity Trading Advisors for Failing to Maintain NFA Memberships

September 03, 2020

Washington, D.C. â The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced the filing of charges against 10
commodity trading advisors (CTAs) for failing to obtain and maintain membership in a registered futures association
(RFA) as required by CFTC regulations. Compliance with this provision necessarily requires all registered CTAs to maintain
membership in the National Futures Association (NFA), which is the only RFA currently registered with the CFTC.

The 10 respondents named in the CFTCâs complaints are: Adale LLC, a California limited liability corporation; Amgad
Gayed Attia, a New York resident; Obie Lee Cole, an lowa resident; CWE USA LLC, a California limited liability
corporation; Suanne Fay Goldman, an Illinois resident; Griggs Research & Consulting Inc., an Indiana corporation;
JPR Inc., a Maryland corporation; Lewis Futures Management LLC, a Georgia limited liability corporation; McClelland
Capital Management Inc., a New York corporation; and Weiliang Shao, a Nevada resident.

âAs the sole registered futures association, NFA plays a critical role in the oversight of CFTC registrants,â said Division of
Enforcement Director James McDonald. âBut NFA can only do its part if registrants submit to its jurisdictional
requirements. Where registrants seek to skirt those rules, the CFTC will act to ensure compliance and to preserve NFAâs
ability to carry out its important oversight function. Our derivatives markets are better served, and the public is better
protected, by these important requirements.â

Case Background

The complaints charge that the respondents, though registered as CTAs, are violating CFTC Regulation 170.17, which
requires that every registered CTA, unless eligible for certain exemptions, must become and remain a member of at least
one RFA.

By failing to maintain membership with the NFA or assert a valid exemption from NFA membership, the respondents have
improperly avoided NFAâs industry self-regulation. The NFA is responsible, with CFTC oversight, for certain aspects of the
regulation of CTAs and other futures entities, including examining CTAsâ qualifications and proficiency, financial
condition, retail sales practices, and business conduct. Because the respondents have not maintained their membership
with NFA, it has had no jurisdiction to perform its vital self-regulatory functions with respect to the respondents.

In its enforcement action, the CFTC seeks an order directing the respondents to cease and desist from violating the
provision requiring membership in an RFA.

The CFTC thanks NFA for its cooperation and assistance.

The Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this action are Douglas Snodgrass, Elizabeth N. Pendleton, Scott R.
Williamson, Joan Manley, and Robert T. Howell.
