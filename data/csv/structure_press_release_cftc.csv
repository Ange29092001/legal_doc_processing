Federal Court Orders California Residents Christopher Valois and Cynthia Wong and Their
Companies to Pay over $1.1 Million for Fraud and Registration Violations

Washington DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced that Judge Cormac J.
Carney of the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered an Order of Default Judgment against
Defendants Christopher Valois and Cynthia Wong, both residents of Irvine, California, and their companies, Bertram
Trade LLC and Churchhill Commodities Trading LLC. The Order requires the Defendants jointly to pay restitution of
$448,371 and a $700,000 civil monetary penalty. The Order also imposes permanent trading and registration bans
against them.

The Order stems from a CFTC Complaint filed on January 28, 2015 (see CFTC Complaint and Press Release 7114-15),
charging the Defendants with precious metals and futures fraud, misappropriation, engaging in illegal off-exchange
precious metals transactions, and registration violations in violation of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC
Regulations.

The Order finds that Defendants Valois and Wong fraudulently solicited, managed, or obtained $737,000 from six
customers through Bertram Trade and Churchhill. The Order further finds that Defendants falsely advertised on the
companiesâ websites that they would to buy, store, and insure leveraged precious metals for customers and claimed that
customers could access the precious metals at any time. However, according to the Order, the Defendants did not
provide any precious metals to customers, and instead misappropriated over $340,000 of customersâ funds by using
customer funds for personal and business expenses. Further, the Order finds that Valois, who had been banned from
membership by the National Futures Association in 2010, and his wife, Wong, acted as unregistered commodity trading
advisors by managing over $380,000 of customer funds in managed futures accounts when they were never registered
with the CFTC to do so.

Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, leveraged transactions such as those
conducted by Defendants are illegal off-exchange transactions unless they result in actual delivery of metal within 28
days. According to the Order, the Defendants never actually delivered any precious metals to any of their customers.

The CFTC cautions victims that restitution orders may not result in the recovery of money lost because the wrongdoers
may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers and to
ensure the wrongdoers are held accountable.

The CFTC appreciates the cooperation of the National Futures Association in this matter.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Camille Arnold, Joseph Patrick, Robert Howell,
Scott Williamson, and Rosemary Hollinger.

CFTC Charges 10 Commodity Trading Advisors for Failing to Maintain NFA Memberships

September 03, 2020

Washington, D.C. â The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced the filing of charges against 10
commodity trading advisors (CTAs) for failing to obtain and maintain membership in a registered futures association
(RFA) as required by CFTC regulations. Compliance with this provision necessarily requires all registered CTAs to maintain
membership in the National Futures Association (NFA), which is the only RFA currently registered with the CFTC.

The 10 respondents named in the CFTCâs complaints are: Adale LLC, a California limited liability corporation; Amgad
Gayed Attia, a New York resident; Obie Lee Cole, an lowa resident; CWE USA LLC, a California limited liability
corporation; Suanne Fay Goldman, an Illinois resident; Griggs Research & Consulting Inc., an Indiana corporation;
JPR Inc., a Maryland corporation; Lewis Futures Management LLC, a Georgia limited liability corporation; McClelland
Capital Management Inc., a New York corporation; and Weiliang Shao, a Nevada resident.

âAs the sole registered futures association, NFA plays a critical role in the oversight of CFTC registrants,â said Division of
Enforcement Director James McDonald. âBut NFA can only do its part if registrants submit to its jurisdictional
requirements. Where registrants seek to skirt those rules, the CFTC will act to ensure compliance and to preserve NFAâs
ability to carry out its important oversight function. Our derivatives markets are better served, and the public is better
protected, by these important requirements.â

Case Background

The complaints charge that the respondents, though registered as CTAs, are violating CFTC Regulation 170.17, which
requires that every registered CTA, unless eligible for certain exemptions, must become and remain a member of at least
one RFA.

By failing to maintain membership with the NFA or assert a valid exemption from NFA membership, the respondents have
improperly avoided NFAâs industry self-regulation. The NFA is responsible, with CFTC oversight, for certain aspects of the
regulation of CTAs and other futures entities, including examining CTAsâ qualifications and proficiency, financial
condition, retail sales practices, and business conduct. Because the respondents have not maintained their membership
with NFA, it has had no jurisdiction to perform its vital self-regulatory functions with respect to the respondents.

In its enforcement action, the CFTC seeks an order directing the respondents to cease and desist from violating the
provision requiring membership in an RFA.

The CFTC thanks NFA for its cooperation and assistance.

The Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this action are Douglas Snodgrass, Elizabeth N. Pendleton, Scott R.
Williamson, Joan Manley, and Robert T. Howell.

CFTC Charges Florida Company Mintco LLC and Florida Residents Stuart Rubin and
Richard Q. Zimmerman with Engaging in Illegal, Off-Exchange Precious Metals
Transactions and Defrauding Customers

Washington, DC â The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced the filing of a civil
enforcement Complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida against Mintco LLC of Delray Beach,
Florida, and its principals Stuart Rubin of Fort Lauderdale and Richard Q. Zimmerman of Wellington, Florida. The
CFTC Complaint charges the Defendants with engaging in illegal and fraudulent off-exchange transactions in precious
metals with retail customers. The Complaint further alleges that Rubin and Zimmerman controlled Mintco and are liable
as controlling persons for Mintcoâs violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA).

According to the Complaint, from July 16, 2011 to the present, Mintco, by and through its employees, agents, or officers,
including Rubin and Zimmerman, unlawfully solicited low net worth retail customers through telemarketing and Mintcoâs
website to buy or sell stored precious metals such as gold, silver, platinum, and palladium on a fully paid or leveraged,
margined, or financed basis.

Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act), transactions of this
nature are unlawful unless they result in actual delivery of metals within 28 days of the purchase or sale, and unless the
retail customers have sufficient net worth to be considered eligible contract participants (ECPs). According to the
Complaint, Mintcoâs customers did not qualify as ECPs; Mintco did not itself acquire, deliver, and store any financed metal
on behalf of its customers; and the transactions did not result in actual delivery of metal to Mintco customers within the
28-day time-frame required by the Dodd-Frank Act. As a result, the Complaint alleges that the Defendantsâ precious
metals transactions constituted unlawful off-exchange retail commodity transactions. The Complaint also alleges that
Mintco was not registered as a Futures Commission Merchant, as required under the CEA to offer those transactions.

The Complaint further alleges that Mintco defrauded retail customers by misrepresenting and omitting to disclose
material facts regarding 1) the past performance of the precious metals it marketed, 2) the price that the metals would
need to reach for the customers to break even on their purchases, and 3) the nature of the relationship between Mintco
and retail customers. According to the Complaint, Mintco charged customers commissions and fees that totaled as much
as 37.5 percent of the customerâs investment and failed to inform customers that in excess of 80 percent of customers
who purchased stored precious metal from it failed to cover their storage costs, interest charges, and other fees and earn
a profit on their investments.

Finally, the Complaint alleges that Mintco contracted with a third party, Worth Group Inc. (Worth), to manage its
obligations. However, according to the Complaint, those financed precious metals transactions marketed by Mintco did
not result in actual delivery within the prescribed 28-day window. The CFTC sued Worth in the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of Florida in August 2013 (see CFTC Press Release 6666-13), charging Worth with engaging in illegal,
off-exchange precious metals transactions and other violations. On January 23, 2014, the District Court entered a
Consent Order of Preliminary Injunction enjoining Worth from violating anti-fraud provisions of the CEA.

In its continuing litigation against Mintco, Rubin, and Zimmerman, the CFTC seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains,
restitution for the benefit of customers, civil monetary penalties, permanent registration and trading bans, and a
permanent injunction from future violations of the CEA, as charged.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Jon J. Kramer, Susan B. Padove, Joy H.
McCormack, Jeffrey Gomberg, Elizabeth M. Streit, David A. Terrell, Scott R. Williamson, and Rosemary Hollinger.

Federal Court Orders New Mexico Man to Pay Over $10.3 Million for Defrauding
Commodity Futures Clients in Long-Running Ponzi Scheme

April 08, 2021

Washington, D.C. â The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced that the U.S. District Court for the
District of New Mexico entered a consent order for permanent injunction, monetary sanctions, and equitable relief
against Douglas Lien of Santa Fe, New Mexico. The court imposed more than $10.3 million in monetary sanctions and
relief for defendantâs wrongdoing, including his misappropriation of client money intended for futures trading. According
to the order, the defendant admitted to misappropriating the funds and issuing false account statements to conceal his
fraud for nearly 20 years.

The order requires that Lien pay restitution of $5,195,679 and a civil penalty of $5,195,679, and imposes permanent
trading and registration bans. The judgment resolves a CFTC enforcement case filed on December 9, 2019. [See CFTC
Press Release No. 8094-19]

Case Background

According to the order, Lien admits that from at least August 2000 until December 9, 2019, he solicited more than $14.2
million from 45 individuals to manage their trading in commodity futures, specifically U.S. Treasury Bond futures.
However, Lien did not invest the client funds, but instead operated a classic Ponzi scheme, using the money to pay other
clients. He also kept more than $3.5 million for so-called âmanagement feesâ he billed clients based on false trading
profits. In addition, Lien gave his clients inaccurate account statements, including erroneous annual IRS Form 1099s that
reported millions in fake profits. The order also states Lien failed to register as a futures commission merchant (FCM) to
legally solicit and accept money from commodity futures clients for futures trades.

The CFTC cautions that orders requiring repayment of funds to victims may not result in the recovery of any money lost
because the wrongdoers may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the
protection of customers and to ensure that wrongdoers are held accountable.

The CFTC appreciates the cooperation and assistance of the State of New Mexico Securities Division.

The Division of Enforcement staff responsible for this case are Bryan Hsueh, Susan B. Padove, David A. Terrell, Scott R.
Williamson, and Robert T. Howell.

CFTC Sues Forex Dealer for Registration and Disclosure Violations

JAFX, Ltd. Solicits U.S. Retail Customers to Trade Forex without Registering as a Retail

Washington, DC - The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) filed a civil enforcement action in the U.S.
District Court for the District of Utah against JAFX, Ltd. (JAFX), a/k/a JAFX, EOOD, of Sofia, Bulgaria and Kingstown, St.

and that it fails to provide customers with the required Risk Disclosure Statement.

Specifically, the CFTCâs Complaint, filed on July 27, 2018, charges that JAFX has been the counterparty to leveraged,
retail forex transactions for customers located in the United States, who are not Eligible Contract Participants (ECPs).

through JAFXâs website, as well as videos on YouTube, where JAFX is, or offers to be, the counterparty to each leveraged
retail forex transaction. Customers are directed to open trading accounts by submitting an online account application
through JAFXâs website, and JAFX encourages customers to access and trade their accounts via a mobile application,
according to the Complaint. U.S. customers allegedly may open an account with JAFX for as little as $100.

CFTC Wins Judgment against Commodities Trader for Commodity Pool Fraud, Including
Misappropriating Funds

Washington, DC â The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) announced today that Defendant Mark R.
Slobodnik of Libertyville, Illinois, has been ordered to pay approximately $370,000 in fines in connection with a $1.76
million commodity pool fraud operated under the name Blue Guru, LLC.

Judge Manish Shah, of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, entered a Consent Order for Permanent
Injunction on November 9, 2018 that requires Slobodnik to pay restitution totaling $280,000, disgorge $45,342.44 of ill-
gotten gains and pay a civil monetary penalty of $45,342.44. The Order also imposes a five year trading and registration
ban on Slobodnik and prohibits him from violating provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act as charged.

The Order stems from a CFTC Complaint filed on January 12, 2018 (see CFTC Complaint and Press Release 7672-18),
which charged Slobodnik, a former member of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), and co-defendants Richard D.
Carter and Blue Guru, LLC with fraud, misappropriation and failing to register with the CFTC. The Order finds that from
April 2014 to the filing of the Complaint, Slobodnik willfully misrepresented material facts to participants and prospective
participants of Blue Guru concerning the profits they were making on their participation interests in the commodity pool.
Among the misrepresentations, Slobodnik told prospective and actual participants that Blue Guru would use their money
to trade futures, including the Dow Jones E-mini and the S&P 500 E-mini contracts on the CME, when, in fact, the
defendants used less than two-thirds of the $1.76 million they solicited and received for trading. According to the Order,
Slobodnik informed prospective participants that they would earn 8 percent per year on their investment plus 50 percent
of any gross net trading profits, and was present or aware of communications advising participants that their funds were
earning consistent trading profits. In fact, the Order finds that Slobodnik was responsible for approximately $249,000 of
the $501,000 in trading losses incurred by Blue Guru.

The Order also finds that Slobodnik misappropriated $45,342.44 of participantsâ funds and that when participants
requested to withdraw their funds from Blue Guru, Slobodnik and his partner ignored their demands, engaged in delay
tactics, and lied about conditions that purportedly prevented them from making disbursements.

Earlier in the litigation, Judge Shah entered an Order for Injunction, Civil Monetary Penalties, And Other Statutory and
Equitable Relief Against Defendant Blue Guru, LLC by default on May 1, 2018 and ordered Blue Guru to pay restitution of
$1,400,076.78, disgorgement of $1,400,076.78 and a civil monetary penalty of $4,200,230.34. The case remains
pending against Carter.

The CFTC cautions that Orders requiring repayment of funds to victims may not result in the recovery of any money lost
because the wrongdoers may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the
protection of customers and to ensure the wrongdoers are held accountable.

The CFTC thanks the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Northern District of Illinois and the Federal Bureau of Investigation for
their assistance.

Weyls, Scott Williamson and Rosemary Hollinger.

CFTCâs Commodity Pool Fraud Advisory

The CFTC has issued several customer protection Fraud Advisories that provide the warning signs of fraud, including the
Commodity Pool Fraud Advisory, which warns customers about a type of fraud that involves individuals and firms, often
unregistered, offering investments in commodity pools.

Customers can report suspicious activities or information, such as possible violations of commodity trading laws, to the
CFTC Division of Enforcement via a Toll-Free Hotline 866-FON-CFTC (866-366-2382) or file a tip or complaint online.
",Release Number 7853-18,"December 6, 2018","CFTC Wins Judgment against Commodities Trader for Commodity Pool Fraud, Including. Misappropriating Funds.","Washington, DC — The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) announced today that Defendant Mark R.
 Slobodnik of Libertyville, Illinois, has been ordered to pay approximately $370,000 in fines in connection with a $1.76 million commodity pool fraud operated under the name Blue Guru, LLC.

Judge Manish Shah, of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, entered a Consent Order for Permanent Injunction on November 9, 2018 that requires Slobodnik to pay restitution totaling $280,000, disgorge $45,342.44 of ill- gotten gains and pay a civil monetary penalty of $45,342.44. The Order also imposes a five year trading and registration ban on Slobodnik and prohibits him from violating provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act as charged.

The Order stems from a CFTC Complaint filed on January 12, 2018 (see CFTC Complaint and Press Release 7672-18), which charged Slobodnik, a former member of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), and co-defendants Richard D.
 Carter and Blue Guru, LLC with fraud, misappropriation and failing to register with the CFTC. The Order finds that from April 2014 to the filing of the Complaint, Slobodnik willfully misrepresented material facts to participants and prospective participants of Blue Guru concerning the profits they were making on their participation interests in the commodity pool.
 Among the misrepresentations, Slobodnik told prospective and actual participants that Blue Guru would use their money to trade futures, including the Dow Jones E-mini and the S&P 500 E-mini contracts on the CME, when, in fact, the defendants used less than two-thirds of the $1.76 million they solicited and received for trading.

Federal Court Orders More than $1 Million in Restitution and Civil Monetary Penalties and
Permanently Bans Andrew Kurzbard and His Florida-Based Company, Guardian Asset
Group, LLC, for Engaging in Illegal, Off-Exchange Precious Metals Transactions

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced that Judge Kenneth A.
Marra of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida entered a Consent Order against Guardian Asset
Group, LLC (Guardian) of West Palm Beach, Florida, and its owner and principal, Andrew Kurzbard, with a last-known
address in Hacksneck, Virginia, finding that Guardian and Kurzbard engaged in illegal, off-exchange transactions in
precious metals with retail customers on a leveraged, margined, or financed basis.

The Order requires Guardian and Kurzbard, jointly and severally, to pay restitution of $434,413.54 and a $651,620.31
civil monetary penalty. The Order also imposes permanent trading and registration bans against Guardian and Kurzbard
and prohibits them from further violating the Commodity Exchange Act, as charged. The Order stems from a CFTC civil
enforcement action filed against Guardian and Kurzbard on September 30, 2015, charging them with engaging in illegal,
off-exchange precious metals transactions (see CFTC Complaint and Press Release 7257-15).

Courtâs Order Finds that Guardianâs Customers Paid It at Least $1.7 Million for Precious Metals
Transactions, Including over $434,000 in Commissions and Fees

According to the Order, from February 2012 through at least February 2013, Guardian, by and through its employees,
including Kurzbard, solicited retail customers by telephone to engage in leveraged, margined, or financed precious
metals transactions. During that period, Guardianâs customers paid at least $1.7 million to Guardian in connection with
precious metals transactions, and Guardian received commissions and fees totaling at least $434,413.54. The Order also
finds that Guardian accepted customer orders and funds and therefore acted as a Futures Commission Merchant without
registering as such with the CFTC.

Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, leveraged, margined, or financed
transactions, such as those conducted by Guardian, are illegal off-exchange transactions unless they result in actual
delivery of metals within 28 days. The Order finds that metals were never actually delivered in connection with the
leveraged, margined, or financed precious metals transactions made on behalf of Guardianâs customers.

The Order further finds that Guardian executed the illegal precious metals transactions through AmeriFirst
Management, LLC (AmeriFirst). The CFTC filed an enforcement action against AmeriFirst in July 2013, charging it and
other defendants with engaging in illegal, off-exchange precious metals transactions, and charging AmeriFirst with fraud
and other violations (see CFTC Press Release 6655-13, July 30, 2013).

On September 17, 2013, the Court entered a Consent Order resolving the CFTCâs claims against AmeriFirst, finding it
liable for illegal off-exchange precious metals transactions and fraud (see CFTC Press Release 6973-14, August 7, 2014).

The CFTC cautions victims that restitution orders may not result in the recovery of money lost because the wrongdoers
may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers to
ensure the wrongdoers are held accountable.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this action are James Humphrey, Elsie Robinson, Stephen
Turley, Thomas Simek, Peter Riggs, and Charles Marvine.

CFTC Charges California Resident Hannes Tulving, Jr., through his company, The Tulving
Company, Inc., with Misappropriation and Fraudulent Solicitation in a $17.8 Million
Precious Metals Scheme

At Least 381 Customers Nationwide Allegedly Defrauded in the Scheme

Washington, DC â The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today filed a civil Complaint against
Defendants Hannes Tulving, Jr. of Newport Beach, California, and his company, The Tulving Company, Inc., charging
them with fraudulent solicitation and misappropriation in connection with the precious metals markets. Neither
Defendant has ever been registered with the CFTC.

In its enforcement action, the CFTC alleges that the Defendants fraudulently offered contracts of sale of commodities in
interstate commerce, namely, contracts for the sale of gold, silver, platinum, and palladium bullion and coin (precious
metals). In offering these contracts, the Defendants obtained and misappropriated at least $17.8 million from at least
381 customers located throughout the United States for the purchase and sale of precious metals, according to the
Complaint.

In their solicitations, the Defendants allegedly made false and fraudulent representations, including that The Tulving
Company was a highly reputable, stable, and established precious metals firm that delivered precious metals to
customers; that it bought and sold in excess of $2.1 billion in precious metals from 1999 through March 2013; and that
precious metals were shipped quickly to customers after placement of orders and receipt of customer funds. These
representations were false, according to the Complaint.

The Defendants allegedly purchased and sold little or no precious metals with the funds they collected from customers.
Instead, according to the Complaint, the Defendants defrauded customers by lying to them and misappropriating their
funds for improper and unauthorized uses, including for the Defendantsâ own financial benefit.

To conceal their fraud, according to the Complaint, the Defendants made false and/or deceptive statements, including
falsely representing that (1) customers owned specific amounts of precious metals when, in fact, they did not, (2)
customers holdings in precious metals had significant value when, in fact, the non-existent holdings had no value
whatsoever, and (3) customers were realizing profits from their investments when, in fact, no profit whatsoever had been
realized.

In its continuing litigation, the CFTC seeks restitution to defrauded customers, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, a civil
monetary penalty, permanent registration and trading bans, and a permanent injunction against future violations of
federal commodities laws, as charged.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Luke B. Marsh, Richard Foelber, Dmitriy
Vilensky, and Paul G. Hayeck.

Federal Court Orders Husband and Wife Team and Their Company to Pay Defrauded
Customers More Than $1 Million in Connection with a Futures Trading Scheme

Washington, DC â The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) announced today that on December 27, 2018 a
Washington State federal court ordered Bellevue, Washington residents Sung Hong a/k/a Lawrence Hong or
Laurence Hong, his wife, Hyun Joo Hong a/k/a/ Grace Hong, and their company Pishon Holding LLC to pay more
than $1.25 million in restitution in connection with an enforcement action brought by the CFTC charging the defendants
with fraudulent solicitation and misappropriation involving futures contracts. In addition to the restitution, the Court
Order also imposes a permanent trading and registration ban on the Hongs and Pishon and prohibits them from violating
provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) as charged.

The Courtâs Order stems from a CFTC Complaint filed on June 1, 2017 in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of
Washington. [See CFTC Press Release 7569-17]. In the Order, Judge Marsha Pechman found that the Hongs and Pishon
misappropriated $1,259,317.77 from their customers. Additionally, the court found that the Hongs and Pishon
fraudulently solicited more than $11 million dollars from customers for the purpose of trading futures contacts. The court
further found that the Hongs and Pishon lied about, about among other things how much money they had under
management; Laurence Hongâs prior trading success; and how trading fees would be deducted from customer accounts.
At the same time, the Court Order found, the Hongs and Pishon failed to tell customers that Laurence Hong had been
imprisoned previously for 33 months in connection with wire fraud charges.

In a parallel criminal case filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, Laurence Hong
and Grace Hong pleaded guilty on March 27, 2018 and March 30, 2018, respectively, to multiple criminal counts. See
Case No. CR17-163TSZ. On October 11, 2018, Laurence Hong was sentenced to a 180-month prison term and Grace
Hong was sentenced to a 72-month prison term. The court ordered that the defendants also pay restitution in the
criminal matter. In recognition of the prior restitution award in the criminal matter, Judge Pechman ordered that the
defendants may offset their civil restitution obligation with payments in the criminal matter on a one-to-one basis.

The CFTC cautions victims that restitution orders may not result in the recovery of money lost because the wrongdoers
may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers and to
ensure the wrongdoers are held accountable.

The Division of Enforcement thanks the United States Attorney for the Western District of Washington and the FBI for

CFTC Charges Michigan Resident Jerry Stauffer with Commodity Pool Fraud and Other
Violations

Federal Court Issues Emergency Order Freezing Staufferâs Assets and
Protecting Books and Records

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced that Chief Judge Paul L.
Maloney, of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan issued an emergency Order freezing and
preserving the remaining pool participant assets under the control of Defendant Jerry Stauffer of Traverse City,
Michigan. The Order, entered under seal on February 25, 2015, also prohibits Stauffer from destroying books and records
and grants the CFTC immediate access to those records.

The Order arises out of a civil enforcement Complaint filed under seal by the CFTC on the same date, charging Stauffer
with fraudulently soliciting at least $968,000 from members of the public to trade foreign exchange (forex) ina
commodity pool, by among other things, guaranteeing pool participants a monthly return on their investment based on
profits purportedly earned from forex trading. The CFTC Complaint further alleges that Stauffer prepared and distributed
to pool participants false account statements showing huge profits, while at the same time he traded very little forex and
diverted pool participantsâ funds for his own use. In addition to fraud, the Complaint alleges that Stauffer illegally
operated a commodity pool.

In its continuing litigation, the CFTC seeks full restitution to defrauded pool participants, disgorgement of any ill-gotten
gains, the payment of appropriate monetary penalties, permanent registration and trading bans, and a permanent
injunction from future violations of federal commodities laws, as charged.

The CFTC appreciates the cooperation of the Civil Division of the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Western District of
Michigan and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter.

CFTC Orders UK Company to Pay Over $490,000 for Registration and Supervision
Violations

June 08, 2020

Washington, D.C. â The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today issued an order filing and settling charges
against Gain Capital UK Limited (Gain UK) of London, England for failing to register as a retail foreign exchange dealer
(RFED) and for supervision violations related to the handling of a customer account managed by an unregistered
commodity trading advisor (CTA). The order requires Gain UK to pay a $250,000 civil monetary penalty, to disgorge
$241,671, and to cease and desist from any further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) or CFTC regulations,
as charged.

The order finds that from at least February 6, 2014 to March 8, 2019, Gain UK acted as a counterparty to retail foreign
exchange (forex) customers who were located in the United States, without registering as an RFED as required by the
CEA and CFTC regulations. Gain UK accepted customers who used U.S. mailing addresses in account applications and
provided documents such as lease agreements, utility bills, and health-insurance enrollment letters suggesting that they
were located in the United States. Furthermore, one customer informed a Gain UK employee that she was a student ata
U.S. university when questioned about her account application and U.S. mailing address. Nevertheless, Gain UK failed to
register as an RFED as required.

The order also finds that Gain UK failed to diligently supervise the handling of the account of a retail forex customer who
was located in the United States. Specifically, Gain UK failed to detect warning signs of the underlying fraudulent conduct
by an unregistered CTA who solicited the retail forex customer to open an account with Gain UK. For example, a Gain UK
employee had extensive communications with the unregistered CTA and was aware that the CTA had been rejected from
managing accounts with Gain UK and its affiliates because the CTA may have been soliciting managed accounts through
social media and a website without registering with the CFTC. Despite the unregistered CTA not being named on any of
the account documents, the CTA had extensive communications with Gain UKâs employee about creating the account,
directed the trading in it, and refunded commissions to the customer to reimburse significant trading losses. Due to the
unregistered CTAâs fraudulent conduct, the customer suffered approximately $280,000 in losses while Gain UK earned
$241,671.

The CFTC thanks and acknowledges the assistance of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority.

The Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Nicholas Sloey, Rachel Hayes, Elsie Robinson,
Christopher Reed, Charles Marvine, and former staff member Peter Riggs.

CFTC Orders Commodity Pool Operator, CEO to Pay More Than $10 Million for Misleading
Statements, Supervision Failures

Portfolio Manager Charged with Fraud

Washington, D.C. â The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today issued an order filing and simultaneously
settling charges against Catalyst Capital Advisors LLC, of Huntington, New York, and its CEO, Jerry Szilagyi, for
materially misleading statements made by Catalyst and one of its portfolio managers, and for failing to implement an
adequate supervisory system to prevent such misstatements. Separately, the CFTC charged the portfolio manager,
Edward Walczak, of Madison, Wisconsin, with fraud in a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District
of Wisconsin.

The order requires Catalyst, a registered commodity pool operator, to pay a $1.3 million civil monetary penalty and
$8,908,481 in disgorgement (including pre-judgment interest). The order also requires Szilagyi to pay a $300,000 civil
monetary penalty. Catalyst and Szilagyi are ordered to cease and desist from further violations of the Commodity
Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC regulations, as charged.

âWe are committed to protecting investorsâincluding those who invest in our markets through mutual funds,â said CFTC
Director of Enforcement James McDonald. âAs this case shows, when companies or individuals make misleading
statements about the risks of investing in their productsâstatements that go to the heart of any investment decisionâ
they will be held accountable.â

Joshua Sterling, Director of the CFTC Division of Swap Dealer and Intermediary Oversight, added: âThe Commissionâs
disclosure requirements are a critical component of ensuring that commodity pool investors have the full protections
afforded to them and for promoting the integrity, resilience, and vibrancy of our markets. We will continue to support
Enforcementâs efforts to ensure that commodity pool operators play by the rules.â

The order finds that Catalyst and its agents made representations regarding risk management of the Catalyst Hedged
Futures Strategy Fund (the âfundâ) that were materially misleading. Specifically, Catalyst is found liable for the
misstatements of the fundâs portfolio manager regarding his management of the Fundâs risk, as well as Catalystâs
misrepresentations that stop-loss measures were in place to limit losses, when in fact no such measures existed.
Additionally, while Catalyst represented that a dedicated risk manager monitored the fundâs risk metrics daily, the risk
manager did not actually do so. The order concludes that Catalyst failed to implement or maintain adequate procedures
to ensure that those acting on its behalf did not make misrepresentations to investors or investment advisors. Finally,
the order finds Szilagyi liable as a control person for Catalystâs violations.

In the complaint filed against Walczak, the CFTC alleges that, from at least November 2014 to February 2017, Walczak
led investors or investment advisors to believe that the fund was a safer investment than it actually was. Among other
things, the complaint alleges that that Walczak falsely told investment advisors that he took specific steps to prevent the
fund from losing more than 8 percent of its value. The complaint alleges that Walczak routinely failed to hedge in the
manner he said he did, ultimately resulting in at least $500,000,000 of investor losses.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) today also issued an order filing and settling similar charges against
Catalyst and Szilagyi, and filed a complaint against Walczak in federal court. Per the terms of the CFTC and SEC orders,
each agency will give credit for monetary sanctions paid by Catalyst and/or Szilagyi to the other. Moreover, per the
terms of the SEC order, a Fair Fund will be established for the benefit of affected investors.

In its continuing civil litigation against Walczak, the CFTC seeks, among other relief, disgorgement of benefits from
violations of the CEA and CFTC regulations, restitution, civil monetary penalties, registration bans, and permanent
injunctions against future violations of the federal commodities laws, as charged.

The CFTC appreciates the cooperation and assistance of the SEC in this matter.
The Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Sam Wasserman, Michael Cazakoff, Candice

Aloisi, John Buffington, Lenel Hickson, Jr., and Manal M. Sultan.

CFTC Orders Florida Residents Isaiah Goldman and Brock Catronio and their Companies,
Paramount Metals Exchange, LLC and Paramount Credit, LLC, to Pay More than $2.5
Million in Sanctions for Engaging in Illegal, Off-Exchange Precious Metals Transactions

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today issued an Order filing and
simultaneously settling charges against Isaiah Goldman and Brock Catronio, individually, and their companies,
Paramount Metals Exchange, LLC and Paramount Credit, LLC (collectively Paramount), both of Delray Beach,
Florida, for engaging in illegal, off-exchange precious metals transactions. Goldman resides in Boca Raton, Florida, and
Catronio resides in Delray Beach.

The CFTC Order requires Goldman, Catronio, and Paramount jointly to pay restitution of $1,595,946 to their customers
and jointly to pay a $1 million civil monetary penalty. In addition, the Order imposes permanent registration and trading
bans on Goldman, Catronio, and Paramount.

The Order finds that, from December 2011 through February 2013, Goldman, Catronio, and Paramount solicited retail
customers to engage in outright cash purchases of precious metals, falsely claiming to sell and transfer title of physical
metals to customers and to arrange for the transfer and storage of the physical metals in independent depositories
where such metal was purportedly held on the customersâ behalf.

The Order states that unknown to Paramount customers, Goldman, Catronio, and Paramount instead treated the
customersâ transactions as financed purchases of metal in which the retail customer only paid a portion of the purchase
price and took out a loan for the balance of the purchase price. According to the Order, Paramountâs customers paid a
total of $3,306,032 and lost $1,595,946 of their funds to trading losses, commissions, interest charges, and other fees to
Paramount and another company. Goldman, Catronio, and Paramount received $853,279 of those commissions and fees.
Thus, the Order finds that, among other specific findings, Goldman, Catronio, and Paramount engaged in illegal, off-
exchange transactions and committed fraud, violating provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act.

Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, financed transactions such as those
conducted by Paramount, are illegal off-exchange transactions unless they result in actual delivery of metal within 28
days. According to the Order, Paramountâs retail financed precious metals transactions executed through Hunter Wise
Commodities LLC did not result in actual delivery to the customer. In addition, as explained in the CFTC Order, financed
transactions such as these must be executed on or subject to the rules of an exchange approved by the CFTC, which
Paramount did not do.

The CFTC cautions that restitution orders may not result in the recovery of money lost because the wrongdoers may not
have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers and to ensure
the wrongdoers are held accountable.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this action are Susan B. Padove, Heather Johnson, Elizabeth
M. Streit, Scott Williamson, and Rosemary Hollinger.

CFTC Orders CHS, Inc. and CHS Hedging, LLC to Pay $1 Million for Inaccurately Reporting
Positions in Corn and Soybeans

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today issued an Order filing and
simultaneously settling charges against CHS, Inc. (CHS), a cooperative corporation for failing to comply with its legal
obligation to submit accurate monthly CFTC Form 204 Reports, regarding the composition of CHSâs fixed price cash corn
and soybean purchases and sales, in violation of the reporting requirements in CFTC Regulation 19.01. CHS is based in
Inver Grove Heights, Minnesota.

The CFTCâs Order also filed and simultaneously settled charges against CHS Hedging, LLC (CHS Hedging) (formerly CHS
Hedging, Inc.), a CFTC-registered Futures Commission Merchant. CHS Hedging willfully aided and abetted CHSâs
violations and is liable for CHSâs violations, the CFTC Order finds. CHS Hedging is headquartered in St. Paul, Minnesota.

The CFTC Order requires CHS and CHS Hedging jointly to pay a $1 million civil monetary penalty and to cease and desist
from committing further violations of CFTC Regulation 19.01.

As the CFTC Order states, under CFTC Regulations all persons holding or controlling reportable futures and options
positions in certain agricultural commodities (including wheat, corn, oats, soybeans, soybean oil, and soybean meal) and
any part of which constitute bona fide hedging positions as defined in CFTC Regulation 1.3(z), are required to file CFTC
Form 204 reports showing the composition of their fixed price cash position in each such commodity hedged. According
to the Order, a purpose of the Form 204 report is to check compliance with speculative position limits by ensuring that
filers that classify their futures positions as hedging actually own or control offsetting cash positions.

The Order finds that during the period from at least January 2000 until May 2013, CHS held reportable positions in Form
204 commodities and was required to file Form 204 reports showing the quantities of the fixed price purchase and sale
open cash positions of such commodities it hedged. The Order further finds that during this same period, CHS Hedging,
on behalf of CHS, filed consistently incorrect Form 204 reports on a monthly basis with the CFTC that did not accurately
state the quantities of CHSâs fixed price cash positions of each such commodity it hedged.

Consistent with this filing, the CFTCâs Division of Market Oversight has issued an advisory regarding the obligation of
market participants to submit accurate Form 204 reports (see CFTC Staff Advisory No. 13-42, Obligation of Reportable
Market Participants to File CFTC Form 204 Reports, which is linked in CFTC Press Release 6639-13, July 8, 2013).

The Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this action are Jordon Grimm, Michelle Bougas, Andrew
Ridenour, Jennifer Diamond, James H. Holl Ill, Alison B. Wilson, and Rick Glaser. The Division of Market Oversight staff
members responsible for this matter are Matthew Hunter, Kenneth Danger, Harry Hild, Eugene Kunda, David Amato, and

CFTC Settles with TeraExchange LLC for Failing to Enforce Prohibitions on Wash Trading
and Prearranged Trading in Bitcoin Swap

Washington, D.C. - The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today issued an Order filing and simultaneously
settling charges against TeraExchange LLC (Tera), a provisionally registered Swap Execution Facility (SEF), for failing to
enforce its prohibition on wash trading and prearranged trading on the SEF platform. The CFTC Order requires Tera to
cease and desist from future violations relating to its obligations to enforce rules on trade practices. Tera is based in
Summit, New Jersey.

Specifically, the CFTC Order finds that Tera offered for trading on its SEF a non-deliverable forward contract based on the
relative value of the U.S. Dollar and Bitcoin, a virtual currency (the Bitcoin Swap). On October 8, 2014, the only two
market participants authorized at that time to trade on Teraâs SEF entered into two transactions in the Bitcoin Swap. The
transactions were for the same notional amount, price, and tenor, and had the effect of completely offsetting each other.
At the time, these were the only transactions on Teraâs SEF.

Tera arranged for the two market participants to enter into the transactions. Tera brought together the market
participants, telling one that the trade would be âto test the pipes by doing a round-trip trade with the same price in,
same price out, (i.e. no P/L [profit/loss] consequences) no custodian required,â according to the Order.

However, subsequent to the transactions, Tera issued a press release and made statements at a meeting of the CFTCâs
Global Markets Advisory Committee (GMAC) announcing the transactions, creating the impression of actual trading
interest in the Bitcoin swap. Neither Teraâs press release nor the statements at the GMAC meeting indicated that the
October 8 transactions were pre-arranged wash sales executed for the purpose of testing Teraâs systems.

As a provisionally registered SEF, Tera is required under the SEF Core Principles of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA)
and CFTC Regulations to enact and enforce rules prohibiting certain types of trade practices on the SEF, including wash
trading and prearranged trading. Teraâs rulebook, in fact, prohibited those practices.

The CFTC noted in the Order that â[t]hese facts should be distinguished from a situation where a SEF or other designated
contract market runs pre-operational test trades to confirm that its systems are technically capable of executing
transactions and, to the extent that these simulated transactions become publicly known, makes it clear to the public
that the trades do not represent actual liquidity in the subject market.â

The CFTC appreciates the assistance of the Division of Market Oversight.

The Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Andrew Ridenour, Kim Bruno, Daniel Jordan, and
Rick Glaser.

The CFTC Order requires Tera to cease and desist from future violations relating to its obligations to enforce rules on trade practices. Tera is based in Summit, New Jersey.

Specifically, the CFTC Order finds that Tera offered for trading on its SEF a non-deliverable forward contract based on the relative value of the U.S. Dollar and Bitcoin, a virtual currency (the Bitcoin Swap). On October 8, 2014, the only two market participants authorized at that time to trade on Tera’s SEF entered into two transactions in the Bitcoin Swap. The transactions were for the same notional amount, price, and tenor, and had the effect of completely offsetting each other.
 At the time, these were the only transactions on Tera’s SEF.

Tera arranged for the two market participants to enter into the transactions. Tera brought together the market participants, telling one that the trade would be “to test the pipes by doing a round-trip trade with the same price in, same price out, (i.e. no P/L [profit/loss] consequences) no custodian required,” according to the Order.

However, subsequent to the transactions, Tera issued a press release and made statements at a meeting of the CFTC’s Global Markets Advisory Committee (GMAC) announcing the transactions, creating the impression of actual trading interest in the Bitcoin swap. Neither Tera’s press release nor the statements at the GMAC meeting indicated that the October 8 transactions were pre-arranged wash sales executed for the purpose of testing Tera’s systems.

As a provisionally registered SEF, Tera is required under the SEF Core Principles of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC Regulations to enact and enforce rules prohibiting certain types of trade practices on the SEF, including wash trading and prearranged trading. Tera’s rulebook, in fact, prohibited those practices.

The CFTC noted in the Order that “[t]hese facts should be distinguished from a situation where a SEF or other designated contract market runs pre-operational test trades to confirm that its systems are technically capable of executing transactions and, to the extent that these simulated transactions become publicly known, makes it clear to the public that the trades do not represent actual liquidity in the subject market.”
The CFTC appreciates the assistance of the Division of Market Oversight.","The Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Andrew Ridenour, Kim Bruno, Daniel Jordan, and Rick Glaser.

CFTC Finds Former Trader David Liew Engaged in Spoofing and Manipulation of the Gold
and Silver Futures Markets and Permanently Bans Him from Trading and Other Activities
in CFTC-Regulated Markets

CFIC Recognizes Liewâs Cooperation and Substantial Assistance in the
Investigation, which Included Entering into a Cooperation Agreement
with the Division of Enforcement

Washington, DC â The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today issued an Order filing and settling
charges against David Liew for engaging in numerous acts of spoofing, attempted manipulation, and, at times,
manipulation of the gold and silver futures markets. Liew engaged in this unlawful conduct for more than two years while
he was employed as a junior trader on the precious metals desk for a large financial institution (Financial Institution 1).
The CFTC Order finds that Liew acted individually and in coordination with traders at Financial Institution 1 and with a
trader at another large financial institution.

In the Order, Liew admits the facts of his manipulation and spoofing activity and acknowledges that his conduct violated
the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and Commission Regulations.

The Order permanently bans Liew from trading commodity interests and requires him to comply with undertakings never
to engage in other commodity-interest related activities, including seeking registration, acting in a capacity requiring
registration, or acting as a principal, agent, officer or employee of any person registered, required to be registered or
exempt from registration.

In accepting Liewâs offer of settlement, the CFTC recognizes Liewâs cooperation during the Division of Enforcementâs
(Division) investigation of this matter, including his entry into a formal Cooperation Agreement with the Division, his
provision of substantial assistance to the investigation, and his undertaking to continue to cooperate with the
Commission, the Division and any other governmental agency in connection with the subject matter of this Order.

CFTCâs Director of Enforcement Comments

James McDonald, the CFTCâs Director of Enforcement, commented: âTodayâs enforcement action demonstrates that the
Commission will aggressively pursue individuals who manipulate and spoof in our markets. Todayâs action also shows
that while holding individuals accountable for their conduct, the Commission will give meaningful cooperation credit to
those who acknowledge their own wrongdoing, enter into a Cooperation Agreement and provide substantial assistance to
the Division in its investigations and enforcement actions against others who have engaged in illegal conduct.â

The Order specifically finds that from at least December 2009 through February 2012, Liew, on numerous occasions,
acting individually and in coordination with other traders on the precious metals trading desk of Financial Institution 1,
placed orders to buy or sell gold or silver futures contracts that he did not intend to execute at the time the orders were
placed (spoof orders). Generally, Liewâs spoof orders were placed in the futures market after another bid or offer was
placed on the opposite side of the same market. Liew placed his spoof orders with the intent to create the false
appearance that the market interest in buying or selling was greater than the actual market interest. Liew placed such
spoof orders with the intent to induce other market participants to fill Liewâs resting orders on the opposite side of the
market from his spoof orders. In engaging in the spoofing conduct, Liew also intended to manipulate, and at times
succeeded in manipulating the price of the relevant futures contract.

Separately, on certain occasions, Liew placed orders and executed trades with the intent of manipulating the market
price of gold and silver futures contracts for the purpose of triggering customersâ stop-loss orders. Liew coordinated this
trading with another precious metals trader at another large financial institution. The intent of triggering the customer
stop-loss orders was to allow the traders to buy precious metals futures contracts at artificially low prices or sell precious
metals futures contracts at artificially high prices.

Criminal Action

In addition, on June 1, 2017, Liew pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and spoofing. (U.S. v.
Liew, Case No. 17-CR-1 (N.D. Ill.).

The CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Katie Rasor, Neel Chopra, Lara Turcik, Sam
Wasserman, Bryan Bughman, Brandon Wozniak, Alben Weinstein, Patryk J. Chudy, Lenel Hickson, Jr., and Manal M.
Sultan.

CFTC Orders UBS to Pay $15 Million Penalty for Attempted Manipulation and Spoofing In
the Precious Metals Futures Markets

UBSâs Penalty Was Substantially Reduced in Recognition of Its Self-Reporting, Cooperation
and Remediation

Washington, DC â The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today issued an Order filing and settling
charges against UBS AG (UBS), requiring UBS to pay a $15 million civil monetary penalty and to undertake remedial
relief. The Order finds that from January 2008 through at least December 2013, UBS, by and through the acts of certain
precious metals traders on the spot desk (Traders), attempted to manipulate the price of precious metals futures
contracts by utilizing a variety of manual spoofing techniques with respect to precious metals futures contracts traded on
the Commodity Exchange, Inc. (COMEX), including gold and silver, and by trading in a manner to trigger customer stop-
loss orders.

CFTCâs Director of Enforcement Comments

James McDonald, the CFTCâs Director of Enforcement, commented: âTodayâs enforcement action demonstrates the
Commissionâs continued commitment to root out manipulation and spoofing in our markets. At the same time, this action
shows that the CFTC will recognize and reward market participants who self-report misconduct, cooperate in the
investigation, and remediate to fix the problems. Over the past year, the Division has worked to enhance its self-
reporting and cooperation program, including through the announcement of new cooperation advisories. The resolution
in this case, and the substantially reduced penalty for UBS, should send a strong signal to the market that the
Commission takes seriously the benefits of self-reporting and cooperation. In addition, todayâs actions reinforce the point
of our whole cooperation programâwhich is to identify and hold individuals accountable for misconduct, and not just the
companies that employ them.â

Further, as a reflection of the Divisionâs enhanced self-reporting and cooperation program, todayâs action shows that the
Commission will recognize and give meaningful credit to companies that substantially cooperate in our investigations and
proactively undertake remedial efforts.â

According to the Order, the Traders placed relatively large bids or offers with the intent to cancel before execution (spoof
orders) after another smaller bid or offer (resting orders) had been placed on the opposite side of the market. According
to the Order, the Traders placed their spoof orders with the intent to create the false appearance of market depth, which
the Traders believed and intended to create the impression of greater buying or selling interest than would have existed
otherwise. The Order finds that, in engaging in the misconduct, UBS, by and through the acts of the Traders, also
intended to manipulate the price of the relevant futures contract.

In addition, the Order finds that on certain other occasions between December 2009 through February 2012, UBS, by and
through the acts of one of the Traders, placed orders and executed trades to attempt to manipulate the price of precious
metals futures contracts in order to trigger customer stop-loss orders and obtain a profit on proprietary trading.

The Order finds that this conduct violated the Commodity Exchange Act and Commission Regulations and imposes a civil
monetary penalty of $15 million, orders UBS to cease and desist from further violations, and to take specified steps to
maintain and implement training programs and systems and controls to detect and deter spoofing by UBS personnel.
The Order recognizes that UBS self-reported the misconduct, cooperated with the investigation and proactively took
remedial steps. As a result, the civil monetary penalty imposed by the Commission has been substantially reduced.

The CFTC thanks and acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation,
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Inc. and the UK Financial Conduct Authority.

This case is brought in connection with the CFTC Division of Enforcementâs Spoofing Task Force, and the staff members

CFTC Orders Florida Man and His Company to Pay Over $397,000 in Connection with a
Digital Assets Solicitation Scheme

April 20, 2021

Washington, D.C. â The Commodity Futures Trading Commission announced today that it has issued an order filing
and settling charges against Jozef Gherman of Florida and J] Squared LLC, a Florida limited liability company, for
making misleading statements or omitting material facts in connection with soliciting more than $300,000 from over 40
individuals to invest in digital assets. Gherman was an employee and one of the founders of J Squared and was its
principal owner and CEO.

The order requires Gherman and J Squared to pay a $150,000 civil monetary penalty, with the amount to be paid by each
capped at $75,000, and any post-judgment interest. The order also requires Gherman and J Squared to pay $247,110 in
restitution, with the amount to be paid by each capped at $123,555, and any post-judgment interest. In addition, the
order imposes a 10-year ban on Gherman and J Squared from trading on or subject to the rules of any CFTC-registered
entity, and from engaging in any activities requiring registration with the CFTC.

âThe CFTC will continue to work to protect participants from false and misleading solicitation practices and hold those
engaging in such practices, including individuals, accountable,â said Acting Director of Enforcement Vincent McGonagle.

Case Background

According to the order, from at least June 2017 through at least June 2018, Gherman and J Squared solicited and
accepted funds in the form of digital currency and fiat cash from over 40 customers to trade virtual currencies, including
Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ether and other alternative coins.

They recklessly made false and misleading statements of material fact or omitted to state material facts which induced
individuals to invest with J Squared, invest additional funds with J Squared, or continue to hold their investments with J
Squared. They also made misleading statements regarding J Squaredâs growth and success as a company, its expanding
clientele, and its ability to be selective in acquiring customers. Furthermore, Gherman and J Squared recklessly made
materially false and misleading statements and omissions regarding the likelihood of profit and the risk of loss.
Customers suffered losses totaling over $247,000.

The CFTC cautions victims that restitution orders may not always result in the recovery of money lost, because
wrongdoers may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of
customers and to ensure wrongdoers are held accountable.

The Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Patrick Daly, Trevor Kokal, Christopher Giglio,
Yusuf Capar, Patryk J. Chudy, Lenel Hickson, Jr., and Manal M. Sultan.

CFTC Orders Pennsylvania Resident Robert M. McMahon to Pay $171,800 Civil Monetary
Penalty and Imposes Permanent Trading and Registration Bans for Engaging in Deceptive
Trade Allocation Scheme

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today issued an Order filing and
simultaneously settling charges against Robert M. McMahon of Mt. Pocono, Pennsylvania, for engaging in a deceptive
trading scheme involving Henry Hub Natural Gas Futures (NG) contracts, traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange
(NYMEX). The CFTC Order requires McMahon to pay a $171,800 civil monetary penalty and imposes permanent trading
and registration bans on him. The Order also requires McMahon to cease and desist from further violations of the
Commodity Exchange Act, as charged.

The Order finds that, in or about July 2010, McMahon engaged in a deceptive trading scheme that allocated to himself
futures contracts priced at better than market prices, while allocating to a customer futures contracts priced at worse
than market prices. To perpetuate the scheme, the customerâs NG orders were filled with noncompetitively executed
block trades, with McMahon taking the other side of the customerâs block trades. The Order further finds that these block
trades were executed at prices unfavorable to the customer but favorable to McMahon. Almost simultaneously, McMahon
executed for himself futures contracts on NYMEX at market prices that entirely offset his noncompetitively executed
block trades for a large profit. Further, according to the Order, with this structure â matching McMahon's
noncompetitively priced block trades almost immediately with offsetting, competitively priced market trades â the
scheme virtually guaranteed that McMahon profited, at the customerâs expense, on each block trade. On July 28, 2010,
McMahon improperly profited $171,800 from two such transactions, the Order finds.

The CFTC appreciates the assistance of the CME Group.

CFTC Charges California Resident Jason B. Scharf, His Worldwide Web of Companies, and
Florida-Based Affiliate Marketers Michael Shah and Zilmil, Inc. with $16 Million Binary
Options Fraud Scheme

CFTC Complaint Charges Numerous Companies, Including CIT Investments LLC, Brevspand EOOD, CIT
Investments Ltd., CIT Investments Ltd., and A & J Media Partners, Inc., with Participating in Massive Fraud

Federal Court Issues Emergency Order Freezing Assets of Scharf, Shah & Zilmil; Order Grants the CFTC
Immediate Access to Their Books and Records

Washington, DC - The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced that a federal district court
has unsealed a civil CFTC Complaint with the Middle District of Florida on July 10, 2017, charging Jason B. Scharf of
Valley Village, California, a worldwide web of companies he controlled, including CIT Investments LLC, a Nevada limited
liability corporation; Brevspand EOOD, a Bulgarian business entity; CIT Investments Ltd., a Marshall Islands business
entity; CIT Investments Ltd., an Anguillan business entity; and A & J Media Partners, Inc., a California corporation,
together with affiliate marketers Michael Shah and his company Zilmil, Inc., both of Jacksonville, Florida, with
unlawfully soliciting and accepting more than $16 million in connection with illegal binary options contracts. Scharf also
does business as Citrades.com and AutoTrading Binary.com, according to the Complaint.

In addition, the Complaint charges Scharf, Shah, and Zilmil with acting as Futures Commission Merchants (FCM) and
Commodity Trading Advisors (CTA) without being registered with the CFTC, as required.

On July 12, 2017, U.S. District Court Judge Brian J. Davis entered a Statutory Restraining Order freezing the assets of
Scharf, Shah, and Zilmil, prohibiting them from destroying their books and records, and granting the CFTC immediate
access to those records. The Court has scheduled a hearing for July 26, 2017 to determine whether to enter an order for
preliminary injunction against the Defendants and also to determine, among other things, whether the court should
continue the freeze on Defendantsâ assets.

James McDonald, the CFTCâs Director of Enforcement, stated:

The CFTC continues to be committed to rooting out and prosecuting binary options fraud in our markets. As alleged,
the fraudulent scheme here involved false claims of outsized profits, fake testimonials, and âguaranteed returns.â
And the scheme, as alleged, was massive, resulting in the misappropriation of over $16 million from more than
8,000 customers. This action should send a message to would-be fraudsters that the sort of conduct alleged here
will not be tolerated. We thank our international law enforcement partners for their assistance in this case.

Scharfâs Website Citrades.com Claims: âThe Most Profitable Click You Will Ever Make.â

Binary options are transactions that allow customers to make predictive trades as to whether the price of a certain
commodity will rise or fall by a certain date and time. As alleged in the CFTCâs Complaint, binary options must be traded
on a registered board of trade in order to be lawfully offered in the United States. The Complaint alleges that neither
Scharf, Shah, nor Zilmil executes transactions on a registered board of trade and none has ever been registered with the
CFTC in any capacity.

The Complaint alleges that since at least January 2014 and continuing to the present, Shah and Zilmil have attracted
potential customers through fraudulent ad campaigns to purchase binary options trading systems, and steer interested
customers to binary options websites like those operated by Scharf. According to the Complaint, Scharf and his
companies then fraudulently solicit customers to open binary options accounts with false claims of outsized profits and
âguaranteed returnsâ trading binary options, bolstered by fake testimonials of purportedly successful customers. The
Complaint further alleges that once customers fund binary options accounts, they do not get their money back. Instead,
the Complaint alleges that the funds are routed through numerous foreign corporations and overseas accounts before
being spent on business and personal expenses, and compensating Shah and Zilmil.

Misappropriation of Customer Funds

According to the Complaint, the Defendantsâ binary options scam has been extremely lucrative. As alleged, Scharf and

Federal Court Issues Emergency Order Freezing Assets of Scharf, Shah & Zilmil; Order Grants the CFTC. Immediate Access to Their Books and Records.","Washington, DC - The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced that a federal district court has unsealed a civil CFTC Complaint with the Middle District of Florida on July 10, 2017, charging Jason B. Scharf of Valley Village, California, a worldwide web of companies he controlled, including CIT Investments LLC, a Nevada limited liability corporation; Brevspand EOOD, a Bulgarian business entity; CIT Investments Ltd., a Marshall Islands business entity; CIT Investments Ltd., an Anguillan business entity; and A & J Media Partners, Inc., a California corporation, together with affiliate marketers Michael Shah and his company Zilmil, Inc., both of Jacksonville, Florida, with unlawfully soliciting and accepting more than $16 million in connection with illegal binary options contracts. Scharf also does business as Citrades.com and AutoTrading Binary.com, according to the Complaint.

In addition, the Complaint charges Scharf, Shah, and Zilmil with acting as Futures Commission Merchants (FCM) and Commodity Trading Advisors (CTA) without being registered with the CFTC, as required.

On July 12, 2017, U.S. District Court Judge Brian J. Davis entered a Statutory Restraining Order freezing the assets of Scharf, Shah, and Zilmil, prohibiting them from destroying their books and records, and granting the CFTC immediate access to those records. The Court has scheduled a hearing for July 26, 2017 to determine whether to enter an order for preliminary injunction against the Defendants and also to determine, among other things, whether the court should continue the freeze on Defendants’ assets.

James McDonald, the CFTC’s Director of Enforcement, stated:
The CFTC continues to be committed to rooting out and prosecuting binary options fraud in our markets. As alleged, the fraudulent scheme here involved false claims of outsized profits, fake testimonials, and “guaranteed returns.” And the scheme, as alleged, was massive, resulting in the misappropriation of over $16 million from more than 8,000 customers. This action should send a message to would-be fraudsters that the sort of conduct alleged here will not be tolerated. We thank our international law enforcement partners for their assistance in this case.

Scharf’s Website Citrades.com Claims: “The Most Profitable Click You Will Ever Make.”
Binary options are transactions that allow customers to make predictive trades as to whether the price of a certain commodity will rise or fall by a certain date and time. As alleged in the CFTC’s Complaint, binary options must be traded on a registered board of trade in order to be lawfully offered in the United States. The Complaint alleges that neither Scharf, Shah, nor Zilmil executes transactions on a registered board of trade and none has ever been registered with the CFTC in any capacity.

The Complaint alleges that since at least January 2014 and continuing to the present, Shah and Zilmil have attracted potential customers through fraudulent ad campaigns to purchase binary options trading systems, and steer interested customers to binary options websites like those operated by Scharf. According to the Complaint, Scharf and his companies then fraudulently solicit customers to open binary options accounts with false claims of outsized profits and “guaranteed returns” trading binary options, bolstered by fake testimonials of purportedly successful customers. The Complaint further alleges that once customers fund binary options accounts, they do not get their money back. Instead, the Complaint alleges that the funds are routed through numerous foreign corporations and overseas accounts before being spent on business and personal expenses, and compensating Shah and Zilmil.

Misappropriation of Customer Funds
According to the Complaint, the Defendants’ binary options scam has been extremely lucrative. As alleged, Scharf and his companies have misappropriated more than $16 million from at least 8,000 victims, most of them located in the United States.

In its continuing litigation, the CFTC seeks restitution to defrauded customer, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, civil monetary penalties, permanent registration and trading bans, and permanent injunctions from future violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC Regulations, as charged.

The CFTC cautions that Orders requiring repayment of funds to victims may not result in the recovery of any money lost because the wrongdoers may not have sufficient funds or assets.

CFTC Orders Goldman Sachs to Pay $120 Million Penalty for Attempted Manipulation of
and False Reporting of U.S. Dollar ISDAFIX Benchmark Swap Rates

Todayâs Action Is the CFTCâs Third Enforcement Action for the
Attempted Manipulation and False Reporting of ISDAFIX Benchmark
Rates

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) issued an Order today filing and settling
charges against The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., and Goldman, Sachs & Co. (collectively, Goldman or the Bank).
The Order finds that, beginning in January 2007 and continuing through March 2012 (the Relevant Period), Goldman
attempted, by and through certain of its traders in New York, on many occasions to manipulate and made false reports
concerning the U.S. Dollar International Swaps and Derivatives Association Fix (USD ISDAFIX), a global benchmark for
interest rate products. Goldmanâs unlawful conduct involved multiple traders, including the head of Goldmanâs Interest
Rate Products Trading Group in the United States, according to the CFTC Order.

The CFTC Order requires Goldman to pay a $120 million civil monetary penalty, cease and desist from further violations
as charged, and take specified remedial steps, including measures 1) to detect and deter trading intended to manipulate
swap rates such as USD ISDAFIX, 2) to ensure the integrity and reliability of the Bankâs benchmark submissions, and 3) to
improve related internal controls. The Order also requires the current supervisor responsible for oversight of various
United States interest-rate trading desks at Goldman to provide a certification as to, among other things, the
effectiveness of the internal controls and procedures undertaken and implemented by Goldman as a result of this
settlement.

âThis matter, the third enforcement action relating to the ISDAFIX benchmark, demonstrates the breadth of this kind of
misconduct across the industry, and within Goldman, the extent of the misconduct across trading desks and product
lines,â commented Aitan Goelman, the CFTCâs Director of Enforcement. Mr. Goelman further commented that âthe
Division will continue to be vigilant and aggressive in protecting the integrity of the ISDAFIX and other important
benchmarks relied upon by the markets.â

Goldman, through its traders, bid, offered, and executed transactions in interest rate swap spreads, U.S. Treasuries, and
Eurodollar futures contracts in a manner deliberately designedâin timing, price, and other respectsâto influence the
published USD ISDAFIX in order to benefit the Bank in its derivatives positions, according to the Order. In addition,
Goldman, through its employees making the Bankâs USD ISDAFIX submissions, also attempted to manipulate and made
false reports concerning USD ISDAFIX by skewing the Bankâs submissions in order to benefit the Bank at the expense of
its derivatives counterparties and clients.

USD ISDAFIX

ISDAFIX rates and spreads are among the leading benchmarks for interest rate swaps and related derivatives, indicating
the prevailing, daily market rate for the fixed leg of a standard fixed-for-floating interest rate swap in various currencies.
USD ISDAFIX rates and spreads are published daily (now under a different name and methodology) for various maturities
of U.S. Dollar-denominated swaps. The USD ISDAFIX rate is used for valuing cash settlement of options on interest rate
swaps, or swaptions, and as a valuation tool for a wide range of products across financial markets. For example, during
the Relevant Period, USD ISDAFIX was used in settlement of exchange-traded interest rate swap futures contracts and as
a component in the calculation of various constant maturity swaps, spreadlocks, proprietary interest rate indexes, and
other structured products. Many parties, including pension funds and local and state governments in the United States,
rely on such instruments based on USD ISDAFIX to hedge against changes in interest rates.

During the Relevant Period, USD ISDAFIX was set each day in a process that began at exactly 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time
with the capture and recording of swap rates and spreads from a U.S.-based unit of a leading interest rate swaps broking
firm, which disseminated the rates and spreads captured in this 11:00 a.m. âsnapshot,â âfix,â or âprintââas it was
referred to by traders and brokersâto a panel of banks including Goldman. The banks then made submissions to indicate
where they would each bid or offer interest rate swaps to a dealer of good credit.

Goldmanâs Unlawful Conduct to Benefit Derivatives Positions

As found in the Order, Goldman attempted to manipulate USD ISDAFIX through its trading at the 11:00 a.m. fixing as well
as by skewing the Bankâs submissions, in order to benefit a range of derivatives positions held by Goldman that were
priced or valued against the USD ISDAFIX benchmark.
Goldman traders bid, offered, and executed transactions of swap spreads, U.S. Treasuries, and Eurodollar futures
contracts at the critical 11:00 a.m. fixing time with the intent to affect the âprint,â i.e., the reference rates captured at
11:00 a.m. and sent to submitting banks, and thereby to affect the published USD ISDAFIX. As captured in emails and
audio recordings, when Goldman had derivatives positions settling or pricing against USD ISDAFIX, Goldman traders
discussed their intent to move USD ISDAFIX in whichever direction benefitted their positions. Goldman traders stated
their manipulative goals in plain language, such as directing their swap broker to âspend what you need, but make SURE
we get the print,â and even objected when their attempts to manipulate were not performed as inexpensively as
possible, such as when the former head of Goldmanâs swap trading desk complained, âI should control the screen without
having to given [sic] some loser another [trade].â

Among themselves, Goldman traders described trades based on the manipulated USD ISDAFIX as being based on the
âjacked price,â aS opposed to the âfair priceâ; remarked that other Goldman traders had âgamed the fixâ in order to
benefit related positions; and strategized how best to extract the âhigher valueâ of USD ISDAFIX cash settlements against
customers who lacked Goldmanâs view, as a major swap dealer, into the USD ISDAFIX setting process.

To complement these efforts, as found in the Order, on many occasions during the Relevant Period, Goldman traders
made USD ISDAFIX submissions higher or lower for the purpose of benefitting derivative positions priced or valued
against the benchmark. As the Order finds, these submissions by Goldman were false, misleading, or knowingly
inaccurate because they did not report where Goldman would itself bid and offer swaps absent a desire to manipulate the
USD ISDAFIX, but rather reflected prices that were more favorable to the Bankâs specific derivatives positions.

The Order describes multiple examples of each of these strategies for attempted manipulation and false reporting by
Goldman traders during the Relevant Period.

The Order notes that prior to the latter stages of the Divisionâs investigation, Goldmanâs cooperation was not satisfactory.
Goldman did not make certain productions as expeditiously as the Division expected and initially failed to produce
certain communications and documents that were potentially relevant to identifying misconduct. The Order recognizes
that Goldman took remedial action to improve internal controls and policies related to ISDAFIX and its successor
benchmark.

The CFTC thanks and acknowledges the assistance of the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority and the Newark, New Jersey
Field Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Candice Aloisi, Gates S. Hurand, Trevor Kokal,
David W. MacGregor, Chad E. Silverman (former staff), K. Brent Tomer, Lenel Hickson, Jr., and Manal M. Sultan.

The following staff members also assisted in this case: Jason Fairbanks, Jordon Grimm, David C. Newman, David W.
Oakland, Mark A. Picard, and James G. Wheaton.

CFTC Charges New York Man with Misappropriating Customer Funds Intended for Futures
and Forex Trading

Washington, D.C. - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced the filing of a civil enforcement
action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Eyal Alper of Tarrytown, New York, for
fraud and misappropriating funds.

The CFTCâs complaint charges Alper with defrauding members of the public by fraudulently soliciting them to trade
futures and/or forex contracts through accounts purportedly managed by Alper, and misappropriating at least $280,000
of the funds provided to him for these purposes.

According to the complaint, Alper improperly commingled the customersâ funds with his own funds, never opened trading
accounts for his customers as promised, and sent false statements to his customers reporting purported profits in the
fictitious accounts.

In its continuing litigation against Alper, the CFTC seeks restitution to defrauded customers, disgorgement of ill-gotten
gains, civil monetary penalties, permanent registration and trading bans, and a permanent injunction against future
violations of federal commodities laws, as charged.

The CFTC thanks and acknowledges the assistance of the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority.

CFTC Division of Enforcement Issues Advisory on Violations of the Commodity Exchange
Act Involving Foreign Corrupt Practices

Washington, DC - The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Division of Enforcement today announced an
Enforcement Advisory on self-reporting and cooperation for violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) involving foreign
corrupt practices. CFTCâs Enforcement Director James McDonald announced the new Advisory in remarks he made today at the
American Bar Associationâs National Institute on White Collar Crime.

âCombatting misconduct that affects our financial markets has truly become a team effort, and that is particularly true with
respect to foreign corrupt practices,â said McDonald. âWe at the CFTC will do our job as part of the team to identify this type of
misconduct in our markets and hold wrongdoers accountable, working closely with our enforcement partners domestically and
abroad. This new Enforcement Advisory provides further clarity surrounding the benefits of self-reporting misconduct, full
cooperation, and remediation in this context, and it reflects the enhanced coordination between the CFTC and our law
enforcement partners like the Department of Justice.â

Brian A. Benczkowski, Assistant Attorney General of the Department of Justiceâs Criminal Division, said âTogether with the
Departmentâs Corporate Enforcement Policy, CFTCâs Advisory on self-reporting and cooperation will make clear to companies the
significant benefits of voluntarily self-disclosing misconduct, fully cooperating with the governmentâs investigation, and
remediating the misconduct. We look forward to working in parallel with the CFTC in cases involving foreign corrupt practices, as
well as others.â

In prior Advisories, the Enforcement Division has made clear that it gives substantial credit for self-reporting and cooperation in
determining, among other things, the appropriate level of sanctions to impose or seek. With todayâs Advisory, the Enforcement
Division builds on that foundation to further incentivize individuals and companies to self-report misconduct, cooperate fully in
CFTC investigations and enforcement actions, and appropriately remediate to ensure the wrongdoing does not happen again.

Anyone with information about foreign corrupt practices in the commodities or derivatives markets can share that information
with the CFTC Whistleblower Office at whistleblower.gov. Whistleblowers are eligible to receive between 10 percent and 30
percent of the monetary sanctions collected. All whistleblower awards are paid from the CFTC Customer Protection Fund
established by Congress and financed entirely through monetary sanctions paid to CFTC by violators of the CEA. No money is
taken or withheld from those harmed to fund the program.

CFTC Orders Paris-Based SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale SA to Pay a $450,000 Penalty for Failing to
Timely Report Swap Transactions

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today issued an Order filing and
simultaneously settling charges against SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale SA (SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale) for failing to properly report certain
non-deliverable forward transactions to a swap data repository (SDR), and failing to timely report to an SDR a large
number of FX swap, FX forward, and non-deliverable forward transactions, in violation of the Commodity Exchange Act
(CEA) and CFTC Regulations. SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale is a swap dealer headquartered in Paris, France that has been
provisionally registered with the CFTC in that capacity since December 31, 2012.

The CFTC Order requires SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale to pay a $450,000 civil monetary penalty and to cease and desist from
committing further violations of the CEA and CFTC Regulations, as charged.

As stated in the Order, the accuracy and completeness of swap reporting are critical to the Commission's mission to
protect market participants and to ensure market integrity. In particular, the Order states that the CEA requires parties to
a swap transaction to report swap transaction information to a registered SDR in a timely manner, and requires swap
dealers to report swap transactions to an SDR within such time period as prescribed by the CFTC. The Order further
states that CFTC Regulations 43 and 45 specify requirements for real-time public reporting, public availability of swap
transaction and pricing data, and reporting of creation and continuation data to an SDR. According to the Order, the
reporting requirements are designed to enhance transparency, promote standardization, and reduce systemic risk.

The Order finds that in July 2014 SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale implemented a software update to its FX trading platform which led to
the trading platform incorrectly coding SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©raleâs counterparty as the reporting counterparty for certain FX
swap, FX forward, and non-deliverable forward transactions, which resulted in no reports being made to the SDR
regarding the swaps. According to the Order, SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale did not discover the error until January 2015, and it was
not until April 2015 that SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale was able to fix it. The Order finds that SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale initiated a project to
identify trades affected by the coding error and in September 2015 notified CFTC staff about its failure to report.
According to the Order, SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale back-loaded approximately 51,821 unreported transactions in October 2015
and in April and May 2016 made submissions to its SDR for approximately 2,024 non-deliverable forward transactions.

The Order recognizes that SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale cooperated with the CFTCâs investigation by self-reporting its errors,
undertaking an internal investigation, and taking remedial action to correct its reporting failures.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Diane M. Romaniuk, Ava Gould, Mary Elizabeth

CFTC Charges Forex Trader and Firm with Fraud and Registration Violations

Washington, DCâThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today filed a federal court enforcement action in
the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Jason Amada of New York, New York, and Amada
Capital Management LLC (ACM), a New York entity owned and controlled by Amada. The CFTC Complaint charges
that, from at least February 2014 through at least November 2015, the Defendants fraudulently solicited potential clients
to open individually managed trading accounts for off-exchange foreign currency contracts (forex) and hid substantial
trading losses incurred as a result of Defendantsâ managed forex trading.

Specifically, the Complaint alleges that the Defendants fraudulently solicited clients for these accounts by, among other
things, misrepresenting Defendantsâ forex trading experience and profitability. In addition, the Complaint alleges that
the Defendants made the false claim that they would implement a hedging strategy that would prevent losses of more
than one percent. As further alleged, Defendants attempted to conceal mounting losses by transferring some of their
commissions into a clientâs account. The Complaint also alleges that the Defendants failed to register with the CFTC as
required.

In its continuing litigation, the CFTC seeks civil monetary penalties, permanent registration and trading bans,
disgorgement, and a permanent injunction against further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC
Regulations, as charged.

Related Criminal Charges

Today, the New York State Office of the Attorney General announced a criminal indictment charging Amada with Grand
Larceny in the Second Degree and a violation of the Martin Act, a New York State statute that prohibits, among other
things, the fraudulent sale of commodities products.

CFTC Charges Florida Resident Neil Pecker and His Company, Vision Financial Partners,
LLC, with Fraud in Connection with Off-Exchange Binary Options and Registration
Violations

Pecker and Vision Allegedly Solicited Nearly $3 Million from More than
120 Clients in the United States and Canada, While Misappropriating
almost $2 Million of the Funds for Their Personal Use

Court Order Freezes Defendantsâ Assets and Protects Books and
Records

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced the filing of a civil
enforcement Complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, charging Defendants Neil Pecker of
Longwood, Florida, and his company Vision Financial Partners, LLC (Vision) of Deerfield Beach, Florida, with fraud in
connection with off-exchange binary options. The CFTC Complaint also charges Vision and Pecker with acting as a
Commodity Trading Advisor (CTA) and as an Associated Person of a CTA, respectively, without being registered with the
CFTC, as required.

The Complaint, filed under seal on February 16, 2016, also names as Relief Defendants Prometheus Enterprises,
Incorporated; Westward International Limited; Coucarin Holdings, Limited; all of Deerfield Beach, Florida; and
GDCM Trust of Las Vegas, Nevada, for allegedly receiving client funds without providing any legitimate services to
clients and without any interest or entitlement to such client funds.

Court Freezes Defendantsâ Assets

On February 19, 2016, U.S. District Court Judge James I. Cohn entered a Statutory Injunction freezing the assets of Pecker
and Vision, prohibiting them from destroying their books and records, and granting the CFTC immediate access to those
records.

The Complaint alleges that, from as early as October 2012 through the present, Vision, by and through its sole employee
and agent Pecker, and Pecker individually, have fraudulently solicited nearly $3 million from at least 120 members of the
public in the United States and Canada to trade off-exchange binary options by making misleading and false
misrepresentations and omissions of material facts to prospective and current clients. Furthermore, as alleged, the
Defendants misappropriated almost $2 million of client funds for their personal use in connection with their scheme by
transferring client funds to the Relief Defendants.

Binary options are options with discontinuous payoffs, either paying nothing or a considerable amount depending on the
satisfaction of some condition. According to the Complaint, Pecker and Vision failed to inform clients that their trading
accounts are with off-shore entities and that clients are unable to withdraw any funds from their binary options trading
accounts, including their principal investment, unless a minimum of trades occurred in their accounts. Pecker and Vision
also are alleged to have misappropriated and diverted almost $2 million of client funds to bank accounts in the names of
the Relief Defendants and for their own use. In addition to fraud, the Complaint charges that Pecker and Vision have
failed to register with the CFTC, as required.

In its continuing litigation, the CFTC seeks restitution to defrauded clients, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, civil
monetary penalties, permanent registration and trading bans, and a permanent injunction from future violations of the
Commodity Exchange Act, as charged.

The CFTC cautions victims that restitution orders may not result in the recovery of money lost because the wrongdoers
may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of clients to ensure
the wrongdoers are held accountable.

The CFTC thanks the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission, St. Vincent and the
Grenadines - Financial Services Authority, Ontario Securities Commission, New Brunswick Securities Commission,
Cayman Islands Monetary Authority, British Columbia Securities Commission, Alberta Securities Commission, and the
British Virgin Islands Financial Services Commission for their assistance in this matter.

CFTC Orders Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. to Pay $70 Million Penalty for Attempted
Manipulation of U.S. Dollar ISDAFIX Benchmark Swap Rates

Washington, DC - The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today issued an Order filing and settling charges
against Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. (DBSI) for attempted manipulation of the ISDAFIX benchmark and requiring
DBSI to pay a $70 million civil monetary penalty.

The CFTC Order finds that over a five-year period, beginning in at least January 2007 and continuing through May 2012
(the Relevant Period), DBSI made false reports and through the acts of multiple traders attempted to manipulate the U.S.
Dollar International Swaps and Derivatives Association Fix (USD ISDAFIX), a leading global benchmark referenced ina
range of interest rate products, to benefit its derivatives positions, including positions involving cash-settled options on
interest rate swaps.

CFTCâs Enforcement Director Comments

James McDonald, CFTC Director of Enforcement, commented: âThis action reflects the CFTCâs continued and vigilant
commitment to protect those who rely on the integrity of critical financial benchmarks. There is no room in our markets
for manipulationâwe will continue to work hard to stamp it out, wherever we find it.â

During the Relevant Period, USD ISDAFIX was set each day in a process that began at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time with the
capture and recording of swap rates and spreads from a U.S. based unit of a leading interest rate swaps broking firm
(âSwaps Brokerâ).

ISDAFIX rates and spreads are published daily and are meant to indicate the prevailing mid-market rate, at a specific
time of day, for the fixed leg of a standard fixed-for-floating interest rate swap. They are issued in several currencies and
are published for various maturities of U.S. Dollar-denominated swaps. The most widely used USD ISDAFIX rates and
spreads, and the ones at issue in this Order, are those that are intended to indicate the prevailing market rate as of
11:00 a.m. Eastern Time. The 11:00 a.m. USD ISDAFIX rate is used for the cash settlement of options on interest rate
swaps, or swaptions, and as a valuation tool for certain other interest rate products.

The Order finds that certain DBSI options and/or swaps traders understood and employed two primary means in their
attempts to manipulate USD ISDAFIX rates: trading attempted manipulation and submission attempted manipulation.

Trading Attempted Manipulation

According to the Order, DBSI attempted to manipulate the USD ISDAFIX by bidding, offering, and executing transactions
in targeted interest rate products, including swap spreads and U.S. Treasuries at or near the critical 11:00 a.m. fixing
time to affect rates on the electronic interest rate swap screen known as the â19901 screenâ and thereby increase or
decrease the Swaps Brokerâs reference rates and influence the final published USD ISDAFIX. As evidenced in recorded
calls and electronic communications, DBSI traders talked about âpushingâ or âmovingâ the fix, or âgetting the printâ ata
price, to benefit DBSIâs positions.

In order to effect these goalsâthrough communications involving multiple DBSI traders, on more than one DBSI trading
desk, spanning several yearsâDBSI Swap traders would tell the Swaps Broker their need for a certain swap level at 11:00
a.m. or their need to have the level moved up or down. On at least one occasion, the Swaps Broker expressed the need
to know how much âammoâ certain DBSI traders had to use in order to move the screen at 11:00 a.m.

On February 28, 2007, for example, the Swaps Broker told a DBSI Swaps trader: âI had to do what | had to do to keep âem
down, right...We got the print...50 is not going to hold it.â As this conversation demonstrates, the Swaps Broker fully
understood that the DBSI trader wanted to keep the price down and get the print that would benefit DBSIâs position.

DBSI Traders Knew Their Conduct Was Illegal

The Order finds, further, that DBSI traders knew their conduct in attempting to manipulate the USD ISDAFIX was illegal.
On one occasion, when a DBSI Swaps trader stated to a broker, âI really have no desire to ever trade equities. Itâs just a
field day for the feds,â the broker responded: âthis will be over soon as well and if they ever figured out exactly how
pricing happened through [the Swaps Broker] on a daily basis a lot of people would actually do jail time.â

Submission Attempted Manipulation

The Order also finds that on certain days in which DBSI had a trading position settling or resetting against the USD
ISDAFIX, certain DBSI Swaps Desk employees responsible for making USD ISDAFIX submissions (the âSubmitterâ or
âSubmittersâ) attempted to manipulate the final published USD ISDAFIX rates by submitting rates that were false,
misleading, or knowingly inaccurate because they purported to reflect DBSIâs honest view of the true costs of entering
into an interest rate swap in particular tenors, but in fact reflected tradersâ desire to move USD ISDAFIX higher or lower in
order to benefit DBSIâs positions. Submitters made false submissions for DBSI by skewing the rates and spreads
submitted to the Swaps Broker in the direction that could have moved the USD ISDAFIX setting to benefit DBSIâs trading
positions.
DBSI memorialized its manipulative submissions conduct in a Swap Desk Guide, authored by a Submitter, which stated
that: âSwap dealer desks submit 11 a.m. levels of rate and spreads for option striking purposes. The options desk may
ask for specific levels.â The then-Head of the Swaps Desk at DBS! understood that if an Options trader asked the Swaps
Desk for specific levels and the Submitter complied with that request, that would be wrong because that would be âfixing
the rate.â

DBSI has taken specified steps to implement and strengthen its internal controls and procedures relating to the fixing of
interest-rate swaps benchmarks, including measures to detect and deter trading or other conduct potentially intended to
manipulate directly or indirectly swap rates, including benchmarks based on interest-rate swaps and to ensure the
integrity of the fixing of any interest-rate swap benchmark.

In the Order, the Commission advised that, under the circumstances, disqualification from making certain offerings
should not arise under Rule 262(a) of Regulation A and Rule 506(d)(1) of Regulation D of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC), 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 230.262(a), 230.506(d)(1) (2017), as a consequence of the Order. In offering this advice,
the Commission considered factors similar to those used by the SEC when it considers waivers of disqualification under
Regulation A and Regulation D, as well as the previous waivers granted by the CFTC and the SEC in prior CFTC actions.
Finally, the Commission's advice is consistent with the guidance provided by the SEC in connection with its issuance of
Rule 506, which states that the provision âunder which disqualification does not apply if the regulator issuing the relevant
order determines that Rule 506 disqualification is not necessary under the circumstances, strikes an appropriate
balance,â because â[i]t allows the relevant authorities to determine the impact of their orders and conserves [SEC]
Commission resources (which might otherwise be devoted to consideration of waiver applications) in cases where the
relevant authority determines that disqualification from Rule 506 offerings is not warranted.â Disqualification of Felons
and Other âBad Actorsâ From Rule 506 Offerings, 78 FR 44730, 44748 (July 24, 2013, effective Sept. 23, 2013). The CFTC
is committed to working together with the SEC on these issues of mutual concern.

In accepting the Bankâs offer, the Commission recognizes DBSIâs cooperation with the Division of Enforcementâs
investigation in this matter. The Commission recognizes that DBSI provided important information to the Division that
helped the Division undertake its investigation efficiently and effectively. The Commission also recognizes that DBSI
commenced significant remedial action to strengthen the internal controls and policies relating to all benchmarks,
including ISDAFIX.

The CFTC thanks and acknowledges the assistance of the UK Financial Conduct Authority and the Newark, New Jersey,
Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation for their assistance in this matter.

",Release Number 7692-18,"February 1, 2018",CFTC Orders Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. to Pay $70 Million Penalty for Attempted. Manipulation of U.S. Dollar ISDAFIX Benchmark Swap Rates.,"Washington, DC - The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today issued an Order filing and settling charges against Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. (DBSI) for attempted manipulation of the ISDAFIX benchmark and requiring DBSI to pay a $70 million civil monetary penalty.

The CFTC Order finds that over a five-year period, beginning in at least January 2007 and continuing through May 2012 (the Relevant Period), DBSI made false reports and through the acts of multiple traders attempted to manipulate the U.S.
 Dollar International Swaps and Derivatives Association Fix (USD ISDAFIX), a leading global benchmark referenced ina range of interest rate products, to benefit its derivatives positions, including positions involving cash-settled options on interest rate swaps.

CFTC’s Enforcement Director Comments
James McDonald, CFTC Director of Enforcement, commented: “This action reflects the CFTC’s continued and vigilant commitment to protect those who rely on the integrity of critical financial benchmarks. There is no room in our markets for manipulation—we will continue to work hard to stamp it out, wherever we find it.”
During the Relevant Period, USD ISDAFIX was set each day in a process that began at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time with the capture and recording of swap rates and spreads from a U.S. based unit of a leading interest rate swaps broking firm (“Swaps Broker”).

ISDAFIX rates and spreads are published daily and are meant to indicate the prevailing mid-market rate, at a specific time of day, for the fixed leg of a standard fixed-for-floating interest rate swap. They are issued in several currencies and are published for various maturities of U.S. Dollar-denominated swaps. The most widely used USD ISDAFIX rates and spreads, and the ones at issue in this Order, are those that are intended to indicate the prevailing market rate as of 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time. The 11:00 a.m. USD ISDAFIX rate is used for the cash settlement of options on interest rate swaps, or swaptions, and as a valuation tool for certain other interest rate products.

The Order finds that certain DBSI options and/or swaps traders understood and employed two primary means in their attempts to manipulate USD ISDAFIX rates: trading attempted manipulation and submission attempted manipulation.

Trading Attempted Manipulation
According to the Order, DBSI attempted to manipulate the USD ISDAFIX by bidding, offering, and executing transactions in targeted interest rate products, including swap spreads and U.S. Treasuries at or near the critical 11:00 a.m. fixing time to affect rates on the electronic interest rate swap screen known as the “19901 screen” and thereby increase or decrease the Swaps Broker’s reference rates and influence the final published USD ISDAFIX. As evidenced in recorded calls and electronic communications, DBSI traders talked about “pushing” or “moving” the fix, or “getting the print” ata price, to benefit DBSI’s positions.

In order to effect these goals—through communications involving multiple DBSI traders, on more than one DBSI trading desk, spanning several years—DBSI Swap traders would tell the Swaps Broker their need for a certain swap level at 11:00 a.m. or their need to have the level moved up or down. On at least one occasion, the Swaps Broker expressed the need to know how much “ammo” certain DBSI traders had to use in order to move the screen at 11:00 a.m.

On February 28, 2007, for example, the Swaps Broker told a DBSI Swaps trader: “I had to do what | had to do to keep ‘em down, right...We got the print...50 is not going to hold it.” As this conversation demonstrates, the Swaps Broker fully understood that the DBSI trader wanted to keep the price down and get the print that would benefit DBSI’s position.

DBSI Traders Knew Their Conduct Was Illegal
The Order finds, further, that DBSI traders knew their conduct in attempting to manipulate the USD ISDAFIX was illegal.
 On one occasion, when a DBSI Swaps trader stated to a broker, “I really have no desire to ever trade equities. It’s just a field day for the feds,” the broker responded: “this will be over soon as well and if they ever figured out exactly how pricing happened through [the Swaps Broker] on a daily basis a lot of people would actually do jail time.”
Submission Attempted Manipulation
The Order also finds that on certain days in which DBSI had a trading position settling or resetting against the USD ISDAFIX, certain DBSI Swaps Desk employees responsible for making USD ISDAFIX submissions (the “Submitter” or “Submitters”) attempted to manipulate the final published USD ISDAFIX rates by submitting rates that were false, misleading, or knowingly inaccurate because they purported to reflect DBSI’s honest view of the true costs of entering into an interest rate swap in particular tenors, but in fact reflected traders’ desire to move USD ISDAFIX higher or lower in order to benefit DBSI’s positions.

CFTC Files Enforcement Action against Chinese National Yumin Li and BVI Company
Kering Capital Ltd. for Defrauding a CME Member in an Illegal Trading Scheme

Li and Kering Capital Charged with Defrauding Liâs Employer and
Misappropriation through a Scheme Involving Fictitious and Non-
Competitive Trading

Court Enters Restraining Order Freezing Defendantsâ Accounts and
Protecting Books and Records

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today filed a civil enforcement action
charging Defendants Yumin LI, a citizen of the Peopleâs Republic of China, and Kering Capital Ltd., a British Virgin
Islands (BVI) company owned by Liâs mother, with fraud, engaging in fictitious transactions, and trading
noncompetitively, in violation of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations. Neither Li nor Kering Capital has
ever been registered with the CFTC.

On July 2, 2015, the Honorable Sara L. Ellis, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, issued a restraining
Order freezing Defendantsâ trading accounts and prohibiting them from destroying documents and denying CFTC staff
access to books and records.

The CFTC Complaint, filed on July 1, 2015, alleges that Li was an employee of an individual with trading privileges on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). According to the Complaint, on six separate occasions over the course of seven
weeks between March 17, 2015 and May 6, 2015, Li and Kering Capital engaged in a series of unlawful money passes
involving the Eurodollar contract traded on the CMEâs electronic Globex platform. Li misappropriated approximately
$300,000 from her employer by trading the employerâs account noncompetitively against an account belonging to Kering
Capital that Li controlled, the Complaint charges.

Further, according to the Complaint, in each of the money passes Li placed an order for the Kering Capital account to buy
or sell a Eurodollar âbutterfly spreadâ at a certain quantity and at a certain price. She then placed a second order for her
employerâs account on the opposite side of the market in the same product for the same quantity and the same price.
After the orders were matched, Li entered into offsetting transactions to close out the position. As alleged, in each
instance, Li structured the transactions such that her employerâs account would always buy at higher prices and sell at
lower prices opposite the account Li controlled at Kering Capital, with the result that the Kering Capital account profited
and her employerâs account incurred a loss.

Li concentrated her trading in illiquid Eurodollar contracts with expiration dates that were five or more years beyond the
trade date, according to the Complaint. She also traded outside of regular CME trading hours so that there would be
fewer market participants trading, and she would have a better chance of matching her orders, according to the
Complaint.

According to the complaint, Kering Capital is a trading company formed in the BVI in November 2014 by Liâs mother, who
is its Chief Executive Officer and sole shareholder.

In its continuing litigation, the CFTC seeks restitution, civil monetary penalties, trading and registration bans, and a
permanent injunction against further violations of the federal commodities laws.

The CFTC thanks the CME Group, Inc. for its assistance in this matter.

The CFTC staff members responsible for this action are Lindsey Evans, Melissa Cavers, David Terrell, Venice Bickham,
Scott Williamson, and Rosemary Hollinger.

Federal Court in North Carolina Orders Tracy Lee Thomas and His Company, Marbury
Advisors Inc., to Pay More than $4.4 Million for Fraudulently Soliciting Customers

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) announced that Judge Loretta C. Biggs of
the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina entered an Order of Final Judgment by Default (Order)
against Defendants Tracy Lee Thomas (a/k/a Treyton L. Thomas, a/k/a Trayton L. Thomas, a/k/a Trey Thomas, a/k/a
Tray Thomas, a/k/a T.L. Thomas), formerly of Naples, Florida, and Marbury Advisors Inc. (Marbury), a Cayman Islands
corporation. The Courtâs Order finds that the Defendants had fraudulently solicited over $ 1.1 million from customers, lost
those funds trading, and provided customers with false reports or statements indicating their investments were
profitable.

The Courtâs Order, entered on April 11, 2017 and stemming from a CFTC complaint filed March 22, 2016 (see CFTC
Complaint and Press Release 7348-16), requires Thomas and Marbury, jointly and severally, to pay restitution of
$1,110,413 and a civil monetary penalty of $3,331,239, which represents triple the monetary gain to Defendants. The
Order also imposes permanent trading and registration bans and prohibits Defendants from further violations of the
Commodity Exchange Act, as charged.

The Courtâs Order finds that between February 2011 and August 2012, Defendants engaged in a fraudulent scheme by
soliciting approximately $1,189,000 from customers by misrepresenting they would invest in Treasury Bills on customersâ
behalf, misrepresenting Defendantsâ prior investment and trading success, and misrepresenting that Thomas, who was a
Managing Director of Marbury, would invest in a conservative manner. The Order also finds that Defendants failed to
disclose that they used customersâ funds to trade Chicago Mercantile Exchange E-mini S&P 500 futures contracts, and
Chicago Board of Trade 2-Year Treasury Note futures contracts.

According to the Order, Defendants also failed to disclose 1) the substantial risk of loss associated with futures trading,
and 2) the net losses Defendants sustained while trading futures.

Further, according to the Order, Thomas solicited his father-in-law by falsely representing that the Defendants were
successful in their prior business and trading activities and the funds would be used to invest in âsafeâ and
âconservativeâ T-Bills. The Order found that Thomasâ father-in-law made several investments with Defendants, wiring an
approximate total of $594,000 to an account controlled by Thomas and which he used to trade commodity futures
without disclosing this fact. The Order also finds that Defendants attempted to conceal their fraudulent conduct by
providing fabricated account statements to customers and to a bank where Thomas controlled a trust account owned by
his late father.

On November 22, 2016, in a related on-going matter, Thomas was indicted for fourteen counts of wire fraud in the U.S.
District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina (see U.S. v. Thomas, case no. 16-CR-298).

The CFTC cautions that orders requiring repayment of funds to victims may not result in the recovery of any money lost
because the wrongdoers may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the
protection of customers and to ensure wrongdoers are held accountable.

The CFTC thanks the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority for its assistance.

CFTC Orders Florida Company to Pay $75,000 for Registration Violations

July 20, 2020

Washington, D.C. â The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today issued an order filing and settling an
enforcement action against Southwest Group, LLC of Fort Myers, Florida for acting as an unregistered retail foreign
exchange dealer. The order requires Southwest Group to cease and desist from further violations of the Commodity
Exchange Act and CFTC regulations, as charged, and to pay a civil monetary penalty of $75,000.

The order finds that from April 2018 through September 2018, Southwest Group, through its website, offered transactions
in off-exchange foreign currency (forex) on a financed basis to retail customers located throughout the United States who
were ineligible contract participants. These retail forex transactions involved Vietnamese Dong or Iraqi Dinar.

According to the order, Southwest Group offered customers forex transactions by utilizing a âPremium + Layaway
Programâ financing option. This âprogramâ was financed by Southwest Group while acting as the counterparty to these
retail forex transactions. Instead of retail customers receiving their forex within two days of the transactions, it took 30 or
45 days.

The CFTC strongly urges the public to verify a companyâs registration with the CFTC before committing funds. If
unregistered, a customer should be wary of providing funds to that company. A companyâs registration status can be
found using NFA BASIC.

The Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Timothy J. Mulreany, Kassra Goudarzi, Paul G.
Hayeck, and George Malas.
