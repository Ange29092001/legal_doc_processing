ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF’S EX PARTE
MOTION FOR STATUTORY RESTRAINING ORDER AND SCHEDULING
PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION HEARING
THIS CAUSE is before the Court on Plaintiff's Ex Parte Motion for Statutory
Restraining Order and Motion for Preliminary Injunction (Doc.
-----------------
S-4; Motion), filed on
January 5, 2015.
-----------------
Simultaneously with the Motion, the United States Commodity Futures
Trading Commission (Plaintiff or CFTC) filed a Complaint for Injunctive Relief, Civil
Monetary Penalty, and Other Equitable Relief (Doc.
-----------------
S-3) against Defendants Allied Markets
LLC, Joshua Gilliland, and Chawalit Wongkhiao (collectively, Defendants).
-----------------
In the Motion,
the CFTC moves, pursuant to Section 6c(a) of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), 7
U.S.C.
-----------------
§ 13a-1(a) (2012), for an ex parte statutory restraining order freezing assets and
prohibiting the destruction of books, records, or other documents; and for an order requiring
Defendants to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not issue.
-----------------
The Court has considered the pleadings, declarations, exhibits, and memorandum
filed in support of the CFTC’s Motion, and now, being fully advised, finds as follows:
l. The Court possesses jurisdiction over the parties and over the subject matter
of this action pursuant to Section 6c of the CEA, 7 U.S.C.

§ 13a-1(e) (2012).
-----------------
as There is good cause to believe that Defendant Allied Markets LLC (“Allied
Markets”), by and through its agents, principals and control persons, Defendants Joshua
Gilliland and Chawalit Wongkhiao have engaged in, are engaging in, and may continue to
engage in violations of Sections 2(c)(2)(C)Gii)(D(cc), 4b(a)(2)(A) and (C), 4k(2), 4m(1), and

-----------------
4, The CFTC has presented evidence that, since at least January 2012,
Defendants fraudulently solicited more than $1 million from members of the public to
participate in a supposed commodity pool purportedly trading leveraged or margined retail
off-exchange foreign currency contracts, commonly known as “forex.” The CFTC has also
presented evidence that Defendants misappropriated pool participants’ funds to pay
Defendants Gilliland’s and Wongkhiao’s personal expenses.
-----------------
Additionally, the CFTC has
presented evidence that Defendants failed to register with the CFTC as required, failed to
segregate customer funds, and failed to operate the commodity pool as a separate entity, and
 
 
failed to accurately report or disclose the performance of the relevant investments, as
required by the CEA and CFTC Regulations.
-----------------
» There is good cause to believe that immediate and irreparable damage to the
Court’s ability to grant effective final relief in the form of monetary redress will occur from
the sale, transfer, assignment, or other disposition by Defendants of assets or records unless
Defendants are immediately restrained and enjoined by order of this Court;
6.
-----------------
There is good cause for entry of an order freezing assets owned, controlled,
managed, or held by or on behalf of, or for the benefit of, Defendants.

7: There is good cause for entry of an order prohibiting Defendants, their agents,
servants, employees, assigns, attorneys, and persons in active concert or participation with
Defendants, including any successor thereof, from destroying records and/or denying agents
of the CFTC immediate and complete access to Defendants’ books and records for inspection
and copying.

8.

Absent the entry of this order, Defendants would have the ability to dissipate

HILLMAN, District Judge
 
On September 27, 2013, the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission (hereafter, “Commission”) filed a complaint against
Defendants Michael J. Siegel, TOTE Fund LLC (hereafter, “TOTE”)
and MJS Capital Management LLC (hereafter, “MJS”) seeking
injunctive and other equitable relief, as well as the imposition
of restitution and civil monetary penalties, for violations of

-----------------
Defendants failed to respond to the complaint, and the
Commission thus requested a Clerk’s entry of default on January
31, 2014.

Thereafter, Defendants having failed to seek to
vacate the entry of default, the Commission filed the present

considered the complaint, the allegations of which are well-
pleaded and hereby taken as true, the Commission’s motion for

this Final Order of Default Judgment as to Defendants Siegel,
TOTE, and MJS and that there is no just reason for delay.

A.
-----------------
SUMMARY
Respondent violated Regulation 23,602, 17 C.F.R.
-----------------
§ 23.602 (2014), when it failed to
diligently supervise limited purpose traders (“LPTs”) in its Kansas City Energy Group (the
“KCEG”), failed to implement existing policies and procedures regarding discretionary trading,
and failed to enforce its own policies regarding the application of mark-ups to customer
transactions.
-----------------
Respondent has cooperated with the Division of Enforcement (“Division”) during its
investigation.
-----------------
In addition, Respondent has cooperated with, implemented, and continues to
implement several of the recommendations provided by the Division of Swap Dealer and
Intermediary Oversight (““DSIO”) during its review of Respondent’s internal controls.
-----------------
B. RESPONDENT
Respondent is registered with the Commission (NFA ID 0449652) as a swap dealer
(provisionally, effective December 31, 2012), Respondent is a subsidiary of INTL FCStone Inc.,
which is a financial services company incorporated in Delaware and headquartered in New York.
-----------------
INTL FCStone Inc. is a publicly held company traded on the NASDAQ,
C, FACTS
During the Relevant Period, Gregory Evans (“Evans”), then employed in Respondent’s
KCEG as an AP, entered into energy swap agreements on behalf of IFCS with its customers.
-----------------
He
also entered into futures trades on behalf of IFCS to hedge the risk from these swap agreements.
-----------------
He handled both discretionary accounts, an arrangement where a broker has power of attorney,
usually a written agreement to buy and sell without prior approval, and non-discretionary
accounts, an arrangement where a broker has to obtain prior approval to buy and sell a particular
contract.
-----------------
Evans engaged in thirty (30) unauthorized trades in a non-discretionary customer account
during the Relevant Period.
-----------------
Evans also applied large “reverse mark-ups” to bilateral swap
agreement transactions in order to disguise these unauthorized trades.
-----------------
“Reverse mark-ups” reference the price of a hedge contract entered into by IFCS, in
which it provided the customer with better prices than the actual prices at which Respondent
entered into the underlying hedge transactions, A reverse mark-up resulted in gains for
customers and corresponding losses for Respondent.
-----------------
This practice assisted Evans in disguising
his unauthorized trading and increasing his own compensation.
-----------------
, An “LPT” is a broker who performs both sales and trade execution functions, i.e.
-----------------
in
limited instances swaps traders were permitted to execute trades in IFCS’s name, and also hedge
those transactions with futures trades.
-----------------
Respondent failed to diligently supervise Evans and the other LPTs in the KCEG as it (1)
provided inadequate oversight of Evans and the other LPTs; (ii) lacked adequate policies and
procedures to ensure that discretionary trading of customer accounts was appropriate and
properly controlled; and (iii) failed to implement policies and procedures already in place.
-----------------
For example, LPTs often obtained verbal authorization to enter into discretionary trades,
although IFCS’s written compliance procedures required written authorization if an LPT
exercised discretion over customer trades, Moreover, IFCS did not have sufficient procedures or
controls in place to monitor discretionary trading during the Relevant Period.
-----------------
Although IFCS’s
policies and procedures provided for an individual with supervisory duties to work on the KCEG
“Swaps Sales desk,” LPTs’ trading activities were not closely or regularly monitored by
supervisors.
-----------------
Finally, Respondent failed to adequately monitor compliance with, and enforce, its
own procedures, which purported to require that mark-ups and reverse mark-ups applied to
customers be within a predetermined range.
-----------------
Respondent’s lack of supervision contributed to Evans engaging in unauthorized trading
for a period of several months without detection.
-----------------
Ultimately, however, the losses and resultant
pressure on Evans mounted, culminating with his July 21, 2013 resignation from IFCS.
-----------------
Respondent has been cooperative with DSIO throughout the course of its review and is
finalizing implementation of DSIO’s recommendations.
-----------------
Respondent reimbursed its customers
more than $1.2 million for the identified losses in their accounts.
-----------------
IFCS also suffered losses from
the reverse mark-ups Evans applied to customer accounts.

L PROCEDURAL HISTORY AND FINDINGS OF FACT""
This action arises out of fraudulent trading activity that Defendants David Christopher
Mayhew (“Mayhew”) and Ron Earl McCullough (“McCullough”) participated in both
individually and collectively.
-----------------
Between December 2008 and January 2012, the defendants
fraudulently solicited approximately 2.3 million dollars from at least eleven members of the
public.
-----------------
McCullough and Mayhew also used Travis Cox to both solicit funds from investors and
further their fraud.
-----------------
They represented to Cox that they were millionaires and that they had made
their money through foreign exchange, or “forex” trading.

Travis Cox a “partner” whereby they simultaneously defrauded him and used his trust in them to
further their fraud against other victims.
-----------------
The defendants’ basic scheme worked in the following manner: the “trader”
(McCullough, Mayhew, or Travis Cox) would approach a potential investor to solicit trade
money; they would entice potential investors by falsely promising high returns, falsely
guaranteeing the security of the investors’ principle, and misrepresenting the risks of trading.
-----------------
Once the defendants had the money, they would either use the funds for personal use or use the
funds to repay other investors, thereby creating the appearance of a successful trade and
furthering the fraud.
-----------------
By doing this, the defendants were able to get at least two customers to
reinvest with them.
-----------------
Over the course of the fraud, the defendants received approximately $2.03
million dollars from customers.
-----------------
The defendants lost $394,000 trading in Forex, misappropriated
$808,000 to repay investors, created the false appearance of profits, and misappropriated
$829,000 for personal use.

There is good cause to believe that immediate and irreparable damage to
the Court’s ability to grant effective final relief for pool participants in the form of
monetary redress will occur from the sale, transfer, assignment, or other

disposition by Defendant of assets or records unless Defendants are immediately
restrained and enjoined by Order of the Court.
-----------------
5.
-----------------
There is good cause for the Court to freeze assets owned, controlled,
managed, or held by or on behalf of, or for the benefit of Defendants, including
assets in accounts held by Maverick Investment Holdings, LLC (“MIH”).
-----------------
6.
-----------------
There is good cause for entry of an order prohibiting Defendants, their
agents, servants, employees, assigns, attorneys, and persons in active concert or
participation with Defendants, including any successor thereof, from destroying
records and/or denying agents of the Commission access to inspect and copy
records to ensure that Commission representatives have immediate and complete
access to those books and records.

7.
-----------------
There is good cause for the Plaintiff to conduct expedited discovery in
order to determine the full extent of Defendants’ alleged wrongdoing, locate
Defendants’ other pool participants, identify pool participant funds and other assets
of Defendants and clarify the source and whereabouts of various funds.
-----------------
8.
-----------------
Absent the entry of this statutory restraining order, Defendants are
likely to dissipate or transfer assets and destroy business records.

-----------------
This is a proper case for granting an ex parte statutory restraining
order to preserve the status quo, protect pool participants from loss and damage,

options contrary to Commission Regulations and by operating a facility for the trading or

Cc, Facts
Coinflip Conducted Activity Related to Illegal Commodity Options
Beginning in March 2014, Coinflip advertised Derivabit as a “risk management platform
,.. that connects buyers and sellers of standardized Bitcoin options and futures contracts.”
During this period, Coinflip designated numerous put and call options contracts as eligible for
trading on the Derivabit platform.’ For these contracts, Coinflip listed Bitcoin as the asset
underlying the option and denominated the strike and delivery prices in US Dollars.
-----------------
According
to the derivabit.com website, a customer could place orders by registering as a user and
depositing Bitcoin into an account in the user’s name.
-----------------
Premiums and payments of settlement of
the option contracts were to be paid using Bitcoin at a spot rate determined by a designated third-
party Bitcoin currency exchange.

Users had the ability to, and in fact did, post bids or offers for

III.
-----------------
The Commission finds the following:
A.
-----------------
SUMMARY
From at least 2011 through 2014, Respondents fraudulently obtained at least $113,400
from numerous individual and entity investors for the purpose of trading commodity futures in a
designated contract market in violation of the CEA, misrepresenting to investors that Phillips had
achieved past success trading futures when he had never actually done so.
-----------------
Respondents
misappropriated a large portion of investors’ funds for the personal use of Respondent Terry Lee
Phillips (“Phillips”), and misrepresented to investors that Phillips was achieving enormous
profits trading on their behalf when in fact he was either trading their funds for significant losses
or not trading at all.
-----------------
Most of the investors’ funds have not been returned.
-----------------
B. RESPONDENTS
Terry Lee Phillips is an individual residing in Indianapolis, Indiana.
-----------------
Phillips is the sole
principal and owner of Phillips Investment and CIC.
-----------------
Phillips has never been registered with the
Commission in any capacity.
-----------------
Phillips Investment & Trust, Inc. (“Phillips Investment”) is a limited liability company
organized in Indiana on or about June 3, 2013.
-----------------
Phillips Investment has never been registered
with the Commission in any capacity.
-----------------
Corporate I Communications & Technology Inc. (“CIC”) is a corporation organized in
Indiana on or about November 9, 2005.
-----------------
CIC has never been registered with the Commission in
any capacity,
C. FACTS
During the Relevant Period, Respondents solicited and accepted at least $113,400 from
13 individuals and entities for the purpose of trading commodity futures.
-----------------
Phillips misrepresented
to his investors that he had traded futures profitably in the past.
-----------------
In fact, Phillips knew that he had
never made any substantial profits trading futures.
-----------------
Between 2003 and 2011, Phillips opened at least five separate futures trading accounts
with various futures commission merchants (““FCMs”).
-----------------
The accounts were opened in the names
of business entities Phillips owned, including CIC.
-----------------
Phillips used these accounts to trade futures
contracts, including, most often, the E-Mini Dow Futures contract (YM).
-----------------
His trading was
consistently unprofitable.
-----------------
In fact, there were only two calendar months — February 2004 and
April 2010 — in which Phillips avoided trading losses, netting less than $500 profit combined in
those two months.
-----------------
By contrast, between October 2013 and March 2014, when Phillips traded the
 
the terms of this Order.
-----------------
Nor do Respondents consent to the use of the Offer or this Order, or the
findings or conclusions in this Order consented to in the Offer, by any other party in any other
proceeding.
-----------------
E-Mini Dow Futures contract in a sixth FCM account that he opened in the name of Phillips
Investment (the “Phillips Investment Trading Account”), Phillips’ trading resulted in losses of
tens of thousands of dollars, most of which Phillips had obtained from various investors.
-----------------
Examples of Respondents’ conduct are described below.
-----------------
In the fall of 2012, Phillips addressed an undergraduate college class at the invitation of
the instructor, who was acquainted with Phillips.
-----------------
Phillips described his business and day-trading
success to the class, inducing six students to give CIC cash and personal checks totaling $2,700,
and to sign contracts providing that Phillips would, through trading futures, generate profits of
$400 or more per student per day in exchange for a commission.
-----------------
Later, Phillips misrepresented
to the students that he had pooled their funds and generated tens of thousands of dollars in profits
trading on their behalf.
-----------------
In fact, Phillips did not actually engage in trading with their funds, and
was not making any other futures trading profits at that time.
-----------------
Beginning in late 2012, the college instructor provided CIC and Phillips Investment with
a total of $33,200, which included funds from a church charity and a trust benefitting his elderly
mother.
-----------------
Phillips deposited most of these funds in the Phillips Investment Trading Account.
-----------------
Phillips provided the college instructor with a fictitious account statement indicating he had
achieved large profits trading on the college instructor’s behalf.
-----------------
In reality, Phillips had lost a
large portion of the college instructor’s investment and was not making any futures trading
profits at the time.
-----------------
In August 2013, six friends and acquaintances of Phillips, all Indiana or Illinois residents,
formed an Indiana limited liability company (the “LLC Investor”) for the purpose of pooling
their funds so that Phillips could trade futures on their behalf.
-----------------
In September 2013, Phillips
Investment obtained $30,000 from the LLC Investor, some of which funds were deposited in the
Phillips Investment Trading Account.
-----------------
Phillips provided the LLC Investor with fictitious account
statements indicating that he had achieved large profits trading on the LLC Investor’s behalf.
-----------------
However, Phillips was not making any futures trading profits and had lost much of the funds
provided by the LLC Investor.
-----------------
Between August and December 2013, an Indiana resident acquainted with Phillips
provided Phillips Investment with a total of $35,000 for the purpose of trading futures.
-----------------
Some of
these funds were deposited in the Phillips Investment Trading Account.
-----------------
Phillips later provided
this individual with a fictitious account statement indicating that he had achieved tens of
thousands of dollars in profits.
-----------------
Phillips had lost a significant portion of this individual’s
investment and had not generated any profits trading futures.
-----------------
In every instance where Phillips provided false reports of profits to investors, he knew
that his statements did not accurately reflect his trading performance.
-----------------
|
Most of the funds Respondents illegally obtained from their investors—at least
$94,500-—have not been returned to investors, despite many inquiries by investors and demands
for repayment.

The Commission finds the following:
A.
-----------------
SUMMARY
Pursuant to Section 4s(f), 7 U.S.C.
-----------------
§ 6s(f) and Regulation 20.4 17 C.F.R.
-----------------
§ 20.4, Swap
Dealers that meet certain requirements are required to file daily large trader reports for reportable
positions in physical commodity swaps (“LTRs”), which are populated with specific data as
directed by the Commission.
-----------------
The LTRs must also conform to the form and manner for reporting
and submitting information as set forth in Regulation 20.7, 17 C.F.R.
-----------------
§ 20.7.
-----------------
During the Relevant Period, ANZ filed LTRs which failed to comply with certain
Commission requirements, On Jan. 2, 2014, the Commission’s Division of Market Oversight
issued a special call notice identifying multiple apparent instances of such noncompliance in
ANZ’s LTRs (“Special Call’).
-----------------
After receiving this Special Call, ANZ implemented changes to
its reporting procedures and submitted corrected historical reports.
-----------------
B. RESPONDENT
Respondent is headquartered in Australia and operates in various locations worldwide.
-----------------
Primarily in connection with its rates and foreign-exchange businesses, Respondent engages in
swap transactions with U.S.-based entities and has been registered with the Commission as a
Swap Dealer (“SD”) since January 2013.
-----------------
C. FACTS
Respondent registered as a Swap Dealer on January 29, 2013.
-----------------
Accordingly, during the
Relevant Period, Respondent was, required to submit LTRs in the form and manner determined
by the Commission.” Respondent submitted LTRs that routinely contained errors.
-----------------
For example,
errors identified in ANZ’s LTRs included the following: (1) prior to September 2013, the
Reports did not identify any underlying commodity; (2) throughout the relevant period, the
Reports routinely populated the field for “Commodity Reference Price” in a format other than
the one provided by the Commission publication: Large Trader Reporting for Physical
Commodity Swaps: Division of Market Oversight Guidebook for Part 20 Reports (“Part 20
Guidebook”); (3) in some cases, ANZ reported certain non-zero positions with a value of zero;
(4) throughout the relevant time period, ANZ reported its positions in units of the underlying
commodity rather than in futures contract equivalents; and (5) throughout the relevant time
period, ANZ submitted reports misidentifying counterparty positions as its own positions as the
principal.
-----------------
ANZ also failed to submit reports for certain days in July and September 2013.
 
, The Part 20 rules became effective on September 20, 2011.
-----------------
Following the promulgation of the Part 20
rules, the Commission’s Division of Market Oversight, through a series of no-action letters, provided temporary
relief from these reporting requirements and certain safe harbor provisions.
-----------------
However, by March 1, 2013, such relief
was no longer available and ANZ was required to be in full compliance with the Part 20 reporting requirements.
-----------------
Due to certain of these errors, ANZ was inaccurately reporting its positions.
-----------------
For
example, in its LTR for August 1, 2013 ANZ reported its positions with respect to CBOT corn in
units of the underlying commodity (i.e., in bushels of corn rather than in the equivalent number
of futures contracts, each of which represents 5,000 bushels of corn) and misidentified
counterparty positions as its own.
-----------------
Consequently, ANZ reported a position more than 5,000 times
its actual size.
-----------------
Accordingly, Respondent’s LTRs did not comply with the requirements
governing Part 20 Reports, which are set forth in Regulations 20.4 and 20.7, 17 C.F.R.
-----------------
§§ 20.4
and 20.7, in conjunction with further instructions provided in the Part 20 Guidebook.
-----------------
In accepting Respondent’s Offer, the Commission recognizes Respondent’s cooperation
in this matter.
-----------------
Throughout the Relevant Period, ANZ communicated with DMO regarding issues
with its LTRs.
-----------------
In communications during January 2014, in response to the Special Call,
Respondent represented to DMO that it had analyzed its past reports, and made modifications to
its reporting system as necessary to comply with its LTR reporting requirements.
-----------------
ANZ has self-
reported and corrected additional errors as they were identified, and submitted corrected
historical LTRs.

The Commission finds the following:
A.
-----------------
During the Relevant Period, McMahon engaged in a deceptive scheme to allocate to
himself futures contracts priced better than market prices, and to allocate to a customer futures
contracts priced worse than market prices.
-----------------
To perpetuate the scheme, the customer’s natural gas
futures orders would be filled with noncompetitively-executed block trades with McMahon
taking the other side of the customer’s block trades.
-----------------
The block trades were executed at prices
unfavorable to the customer but favorable to McMahon.
-----------------
At roughly the same time as the block
trades were executed, McMahon had executed for himself futures contracts on NYMEX at
market prices that entirely offset his noncompetitively-executed block trades with their better-
than-market prices.
-----------------
With this structure—matching McMahon’s noncompetitively priced block
trades almost immediately with offsetting, competitively priced market trades—the scheme
virtually guaranteed that McMahon profited, at the customer’s expense, on each block trade.
-----------------
On
July 28, 2010, McMahon improperly profited $171,800 from two such transactions.
-----------------
B. RESPONDENT
Robert M. McMahon is a resident of Mt.
-----------------
Pocono, Pennsylvania.
-----------------
Before and after the
Relevant Period, McMahon was registered with the Commission as an associated person,
During the Relevant Period, McMahon was not registered with the Commission in any capacity,
and McMahon’s application for registration as an associated person was pending.
-----------------
C, FACTS
Before the Relevant Period, McMahon worked at various entities for several years
trading commodities and commodity futures contracts and was registered with the Commission
as an associated person.
-----------------
In July 2010, he was no longer registered or employed by a registrant.
-----------------
During the Relevant Period, McMahon and a floor trading clerk engaged in a scheme that
worked as follows.
-----------------
First, the clerk placed with a floor broker an order for NYMEX Henry Hub
Natural Gas Futures Contracts in an amount desired by a customer.
-----------------
At roughly the same time
that order was executed, the clerk reported a noncompetitive block trade between McMahon and
the customer, buying and selling the same amount of natural gas futures contracts as in the order
placed with the floor broker, but at a worse price for the customer than the market prices.
-----------------
Pursuant to McMahon’s scheme, the clerk then allocated the market trades and the
offsetting side of the block trade to McMahon’s account, thus liquidating McMahon’s market
trades and block trades at a profit.
-----------------
The clerk also allocated the opposite side of the block trade to
the customer’s account, thus filling the customer’s order at a worse price for the customer than
the market prices.
-----------------
In this way, without disclosing the allocation scheme to the customer,
McMahon received the better than market prices for himself while worse than market prices
were received by the customer.
-----------------
findings or conclusions in this Order consented to in the Offer, by any other party in any other
proceeding.
-----------------
In particular, McMahon engaged in two such allocations on July 28, 2010.
-----------------
One
transaction involved a block trade between McMahon and the customer for 124 August 2010
futures contracts at better than market prices for McMahon and worse than market prices for the
customer.
-----------------
The other involved a block trade between McMahon and the customer for 196
September 2010 futures contracts at better than market prices for McMahon and worse than
market prices for the customer.
-----------------
At roughly the same time that each block trade was executed,
McMahon exactly offset his better than market-priced block trades against his market-priced
trades, thereby accruing $171,800 in profits with virtually no risk.
-----------------
Ii.

LEGAL DISCUSSION
McMahon Engaged in Trade-Practices Fraud
Section 4b(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
-----------------
§ 6b(a), applies to the futures contracts transactions
conducted by Respondent in this matter because they were in or in connection with the making
of contracts of sale of a commodity for future delivery made on or subject to the rules of a
designated contract market, namely NYMEX.
-----------------
In particular, Sections 4b(a)(1)(A) and (C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
-----------------
§ 6b(a)(1)(A) and (C),
make it unlawful
for any person, in or in connection with any order to make, or the making of, any contract
of sale of any commodity in interstate commerce or for future delivery that is made, or to
be made, on or subject to the rules of a designated contract market, for or on behalf of
any other person... (A) to cheat or defraud or attempt to cheat or defraud the other
person; [or] (C) willfully to deceive or attempt to deceive the other person by any means
whatsoever in regard to any order or contract or the disposition or execution of any order
or contract, or in regard to any act of agency performed, with respect to any order or
contract for... the other person....
-----------------
Causing deceptive allocation of favorable futures order fills to an account from which
one benefits violates Sections 4b(a)(1)(A) and (C).

TeraExchange LLC,
Respondent.
-----------------
Nene Newnes “ee ee”
 
I.
-----------------
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“Commission’’) has reason to believe that
TeraExchange, LLC (‘Tera’), a provisionally registered swap execution facility (“SEF”), has
violated Section 5h(f)(2) of the Commodity Exchange Act (“Act”), 7 U.S.C.
-----------------
§ 7b-3(1)(2) (2012),
and Commission Regulation (“Regulation’’) 37.203, 17 C.F.R.
-----------------
§ 37.203 (2014).
-----------------
The
Commission, therefore, deems it appropriate and in the public interest that a public
administrative proceeding be, and hereby is, instituted to determine whether Tera engaged in the
violations set forth herein and to determine whether any order should be issued imposing
remedial sanctions.
-----------------
Il.
-----------------
In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Tera has submitted an
Offer of Settlement (“Offer’’), which the Commission has determined to accept.
-----------------
Tera
acknowledges service of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 6(c) and 6(d) of
the Commodity Exchange Act, Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (“Order”). '
-----------------
' Tera consents to the entry of this Order, the use of these findings in this proceeding and
in any other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party;
provided, however, that Tera does not consent to the use of the Offer, or the findings in this
Order consented to in the Offer, as the sole basis for any other proceeding brought by the
Commission, other than a proceeding in bankruptcy or to enforce the terms of this Order.
-----------------
Nor
does Tera consent to the use of the Offer or this Order, or the findings consented to in the Offer
or this Order, by any other party in any other proceeding.
-----------------
III.","The Commission finds the following:
A.
-----------------
Summary
On October 8, 2014, two traders executed a transaction in a non-deliverable forward
contract based on the relative value of the U.S. Dollar and Bitcoin, a virtual currency (the
“Bitcoin swap”).
-----------------
Six minutes later, the two traders executed a fully offsetting transaction in the
Bitcoin swap for the same price and notional amount.
-----------------
As a result, the two transactions (the
“October 8 transactions”) constitute both wash trading and prearranged trading in violation of
Section 4c(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
-----------------
§ 6c(a) (2012).
-----------------
Tera arranged the two transactions with the understanding that the parties, who did not
know of each other’s identities, would execute “a round-trip trade with the same price in, same
price out (i.e.
-----------------
no P/L [profit/loss] consequences)[.
-----------------
]” Tera employees were on Skype calls with
the two traders as they executed the transactions.
-----------------
The two traders involved were the only market
participants on Tera’s SEF who had completed the membership process and had received trading
privileges on the SEF.
-----------------
On October 9, 2014, Tera issued a press release, stating that ““TeraExchange announced
today the first bitcoin derivative transaction to be executed on a regulated exchange.” Tera
intended for its press release and a related statement by its then-president to create the
impression of actual trading interest in the Bitcoin swap.
-----------------
Section 5h(f)(2)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
-----------------
§ 7b-3(f)(1) (2012) and Regulation 37.203(a), 17
C.F.R.
-----------------
§ 37.203(a) (2014), obligate Tera to establish and enforce rules prohibiting wash trading
and prearranged trading on the SEF.
-----------------
Instead, Tera actively arranged for the two traders to enter
into prearranged wash trades.
-----------------
B. Respondent
TeraExchange, LLC is a Delaware limited liability company, with its principal place of
business in Summit, New Jersey.
-----------------
Tera has been registered provisionally with the Commission as
a SEF since September 19, 2013, with its application for permanent SEF registration pending.
-----------------
C, Facts
Tera is operating a SEF pursuant to a grant of temporary registration by the
Commission’s Division of Market Oversight (“DMO”) effective September 19, 2013.
-----------------
Tera compiled a rulebook governing the operation of the SEF and trading on the SEF by
market participants.
-----------------
Tera requires all participants on its SEF to comply with the SEF’s rulebook.
-----------------
Tera’s rulebook states, in relevant part, that
“(njo Participant shall create fictitious transactions or wash transactions or
execute any such Order with knowledge of its nature.
-----------------
No Participant shall place
or accept Orders in the same Instrument where the Participant knows or
2
reasonably should know that the purpose of the Orders is to avoid taking a bona
fide market position exposed to market risk (transactions commonly known or
referred to as wash sales).”
On September 11, 2014, Tera filed with DMO a submission self-certifying the Bitcoin
swap for trading on its SEF.
-----------------
Tera began offering the Bitcoin swap for trading on September 12,
2014.
-----------------
Valuations of the Bitcoin swap are determined by reference to an index of bids, offers,
and executed transactions on a number of Bitcoin exchanges (the “Tera Bitcoin index”).
-----------------
Tera’s rulebook requires a market participant to complete an onboarding process,
including the completion of an exchange user license agreement (“EULA”), before being granted
membership and being allowed to trade any product on the Tera SEF.
-----------------
As of October 8, 2014,
only two market participants (“Firm A” and “Firm B”) had completed the onboarding processes
to trade on the Tera SEF.
-----------------
On October 7, 2014, an employee of Tera sent an email to an authorized trader for Firm
B (“Trader B”’), which had recently completed the onboarding process.
-----------------
The Tera employee
stated that Tera had “ta counterparty [Firm A] who would like to do a trade.” The Tera employee
said “we would like to test the pipes by doing a round-trip trade with the same price in, same
price out, (i.e.
-----------------
no P/L [profit/loss] consequences) no custodian required.” On a call that
afternoon with the Tera employee, Trader B agreed to the trade, scheduled for the following day.
-----------------
On the morning of October 8, 2014, Tera employees initiated Skype calls with both
Trader A and Trader B to walk them through the trade.
-----------------
At 9:22 a.m., Trader A initiated a
transaction to buy a Bitcoin swap with a notional amount of $500,000 at a defined price, which
Trader B accepted.
-----------------
Six minutes later, Trader A initiated a transaction to sell a Bitcoin swap with
a notional amount of $500,000 and at the same defined price, which Trader B also accepted.
-----------------
The two transactions on October 8 canceled each other out.
-----------------
The transactions were
offsetting, were intended to negate, and did negate, any market risk and achieved a “wash”
result.
-----------------
The transactions did not create any bona fide position in the Bitcoin swap.
-----------------
Further, Tera
did not charge a transaction fee or commission to either party, meaning that there were no
transaction costs associated with the two transactions,
On October 8, 2014, the National Futures Association (“NFA”) (which provides
regulatory services for Tera) and the CFTC’s Division of Market Oversight (“DMO”’) separately
contacted Tera regarding the two offsetting transactions.
-----------------
Tera told DMO and the NFA that the
purpose of the transactions was to “test the pipes.”
Nevertheless, on October 9, 2014, Tera issued a press release, stating that ““TeraExchange
announced today the first bitcoin derivative transaction to be executed on a regulated exchange.”
Tera employees forwarded drafts of the press release to Trader A and made some edits at his
request.” Also on October 9, 2014, Tera’s then-president appeared at a meeting of the
Commission’s Global Markets Advisory Committee (““GMAC”), where he stated that trades had
occurred in the Bitcoin swap the day before.
-----------------
The October 8 transactions were the only transactions in the Bitcoin swap executed on
the Tera SEF as of the date of this Order and provided an opportunity for Tera to state publicly
that trading in the Bitcoin swap had occurred.
-----------------
Tera intended for its press release and statements
at the GMAC to create the impression of actual trading interest in the Bitcoin swap.
-----------------
As a result,
neither Tera’s press release nor the statements at the GMAC indicated that the October 8
transactions were pre-arranged wash sales executed solely for the purpose of testing Tera’s
systems.
-----------------
These facts should be distinguished from a situation where a SEF or other designated
contract market runs pre-operational test trades to confirm that its systems are technically
capable of executing transactions and, to the extent that these simulated transactions become
publicly known, makes it clear to the public that the trades do not represent actual liquidity in the
subject market.
-----------------
D. Legal Discussion

-----------------
Compliance with SEF Core Principles
As a condition of registration, SEFs are obligated to comply with the SEF Core Principles
under the Act.
-----------------
Section 5h(f)(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
-----------------
§ 7b-3(f)(1) (2012).
-----------------
SEF Core Principle 2
requires that a SEF shall “establish and enforce trading, trade processing, and participation rules
that will deter abuses and have the capacity to detect, investigate, and enforce those rules[.

Section 5h(f)(2)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
-----------------
§ 7b-3(f)(2)(B) (2012).
-----------------
A Commission regulation providing additional guidance on compliance with SEF Core
Principle 2 requires SEFs to “prohibit abusive trading practices on its markets...

De Prohibition on Wash Trading and Prearranged Trading
Market participants are prohibited from engaging in “wash trading” and “prearranged
trading” in swaps under Section 4c(a) of the Act, which makes it unlawful to enter a transaction
that “is, is of the character of, or is commonly known to the trade as, a ‘wash sale’ or
‘accommodation trade’...or is a fictitious sale or is used to cause any price to be reported,
registered, or recorded that is not a true and bona fide price.” 7 U.S.C.
-----------------
§ 6c(a)(2).° Congress
 
; Following conversations with counsel for the Commission, Tera voluntarily removed the
October 9 press release from its website.
-----------------
: As relevant here, pursuant to Section 2(a)(1)(A) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
-----------------
§ 2(a)(1)(A) (2012)
the Commission has exclusive jurisdiction over “transactions involving swaps...traded or
executed on a... swap execution facility pursuant to section 5h”.
-----------------
In addition, the swap offered by
Tera is not subject to any exceptions to the CFTC’s jurisdiction.
-----------------
Regardless, Tera’s submission

enacted Section 4c(a) of the Act to prevent collusive trades conducted away from the market.

The Commission need not, however, prove both intent

TeraExchange, trading in the USD/Bitcoin Swap will be subject to compliance with the Act,
Regulations and the TeraExchange Rulebook[.

the Act, including the prohibitions on wash trading and pre-arranged trading under Section 4c(a)
of the Act, to trading in the Bitcoin swap.
-----------------
Section 4c(a) of the Act applies to transactions involving the purchase or sale of any
commodity for future delivery or swap that, inter alia, may be used to “hedge any transaction in
interstate commerce in the commodity|.
-----------------

swap may be used to hedge transactions in interstate commerce in Bitcoin.

-----------------
a The October 8 Transactions Constitute Wash Trading and Prearranged
Trading
The October 8 transactions in the Bitcoin swap constitute wash trading.
-----------------
Trader A and
Trader B effected a wash result by the purchase and sale of the same product with the same tenor
and notional amount for the same price.
-----------------
Trader A and Trader B entered into the transaction
with the knowledge that the transactions were designed to achieve a wash result in a manner that
negated risk, as demonstrated in the Tera employee’s October 7 email to Trader B that the trades
would have “no P/L consequences.” Because Trader A and Trader B were the only participants
in the Bitcoin swap market at the time of the transactions, neither bore any price risk as their
transactions would set the only prices in the market.
-----------------
Further, Trader A and Trader B, as facilitated by Tera employees, prearranged the two
October 8 transactions.
-----------------
Trader A and Trader B initiated the transactions “‘with the understanding
that it would be matched such that” the net financial result would be a nullity.
-----------------
While Trader A
and Trader B did not communicate directly with each other regarding the two transactions,
Tera’s involvement allowed Trader A and Trader B to prearrange the transactions while negating
any market risk.
-----------------
As a result, the October 8 transactions constitute both wash trading and prearranged
trading in violation of Section 4c(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
-----------------
§ 6c(a) (2012).
-----------------
, The tenor of a swap is the period of time that the swap is in effect.
-----------------
As such, tenor is
equivalent to the contract month of a futures contract.

4, Tera Failed to Deter, and in Fact Facilitated, Wash Trading and
Prearranged Trading in the Bitcoin Swap
Tera was obligated under Core Principle 2 to establish and enforce rules to prohibit wash
trading and prearranged trading on the SEF.
-----------------
Instead, Tera actively facilitated wash trading and
prearranged trading by bringing together two market participants with the express purpose of
entering into two offsetting transactions.
-----------------
Tera told Trader B that the transactions would be “‘a
round-trip trade with the same price in, same price out, (i.e.
-----------------
no P/L [profit/loss]
consequences)[.
-----------------
]” Further, Tera employees were on the telephone with both Trader A and
Trader B during the October 8 transactions to help walk the traders through the transactions.
-----------------
Tera also ensured that the two transactions would have no transaction costs by not
charging any fees to Trader A or Trader B. Tera assured Trader B that no custodian would be
required, meaning that neither party would be required to post collateral for the trades.
-----------------
By failing to enforce its rules against wash trading, and in fact actively arranging a wash
trade, Tera failed to comply with its obligations under SEF Core Principle 2 and Regulation
37.203(a), 17 C.F.R § 37.203(a) (2014).
-----------------
Further, as a result of the wash trading and prearranged
trading, Tera’s trading platform submitted reports of the two transactions to a swap data
repository which made the reports public.
-----------------
The reports of the two transactions created a
misleading impression of trading volume in the Bitcoin swap.”

FINDINGS OF VIOLATIONS
Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that Tera violated Section Sh(f)(2) of the
Act, 7 U.S.C.

ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTIONS 6(c) AND 6(d) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, AS AMENDED,
MAKING FINDINGS AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS
1
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“Commission”) has reason to believe that
on October 22, 2014, Barbara Cohen (“Cohen”) violated Section 6(c)(2) of the Commodity
Exchange Act, as amended (“Act”), 7 U.S.C.
-----------------
§ 9(2) (2012) and during the period from March
2012 to January 2013 (“2012-2013 period’) Cohen violated Commission Regulation 4.41(b), 17
C.F.R.
-----------------
§ 4.41(b) (2014), pursuant to § 13(b) of the Act, 7 USC §13c(b).
-----------------
Also, during the 2012-
2013 period, Pure Reason, LLC (“Pure Reason”) violated Regulation 4.41(b), 17 C.F.R.
-----------------
§
4.41(b) (2014).
-----------------
Therefore, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest that
public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted to determine whether Cohen and
Pure Reason (collectively, “Respondents”) engaged in the violations set forth herein and to
determine whether any order should be issued imposing remedial sanctions.
-----------------
Il.
-----------------
In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Respondents have
submitted an Offer of Settlement (“Offer”), which the Commission has determined to accept.
-----------------
Without admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, Respondents consent to
the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 6(c) and 6(d) of the
Commodity Exchange Act, as Amended, Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions
(“Order”) and acknowledge service of this Order.
-----------------
!
-----------------
Respondents consent to the entry of this Order and to the use of these findings in this proceeding and in
any other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party; provided,
however, that Respondents do not consent to the use of the Offer, or the findings or conclusions in this
Order consented to in the Offer, as the sole basis for any other proceeding brought by the Commission,
other than in a proceeding in bankruptcy or to enforce the terms of this Order.
-----------------
Nor do Respondents
 
TI.
-----------------
The Commission finds the following:
A.
-----------------
SUMMARY
In connection with the Commission’s investigation of Respondents, on October 22, 2014,
Cohen knowingly made false and misleading statements to Commission staff while testifying
under oath.
-----------------
Cohen falsely testified that she was authorized to trade and traded an account that
she never in fact traded or had any authority to trade.
-----------------
Further, during the 2012-2013 period, Pure Reason’s website, which was developed and
maintained by Cohen, promoted Pure Reason’s trading software by demonstrating profitable
trading results without disclosing that these results were based on hypothetical, and not actual,
trading.
-----------------
B. RESPONDENTS
Barbara Cohen, resides in Tarpon Springs, Florida.
-----------------
Cohen has been registered as an
associated person (“AP”) of Pure Reason since August 2007 and is an owner, principal and Chief
Operating Officer (“COO”) of Pure Reason.
-----------------
In addition, Cohen has been registered as an AP of
Vankar Trading Corporation (“Vankar’”) since May 2014, and is a branch manager and forex AP
of Vankar.
-----------------
Pure Reason, LLC, has been registered in Florida as a limited liability company since
September 2005, has its principal place of business in Tarpon Springs, Florida, and has been
registered with the Commission as a commodity trading advisor (“CTA”) since August 2007.
-----------------
C. FACTS
During the 2012-2013 period, Cohen developed and maintained a website on behalf of
Pure Reason, a registered CTA, to promote the sale of a software trading program and courses on
how to use the software.
-----------------
Cohen, a registered AP of Pure Reason, also is a principal, part owner,
and COO of Pure Reason.
-----------------
Cohen was the prime author of the software program sold by Pure Reason, taught a
number of classes offered by Pure Reason and represented on the website that she had traded
crude oil products.
-----------------
Through this software, customers received indicators of market trends in
such products as e-mini futures contracts, crude oil futures contracts and foreign currency
transactions.
-----------------
consent to the use of the Offer or this Order, or the findings or conclusions in this Order consented to in
the Offer, by any other party in any other proceeding.
-----------------
The website, which contained links to weekly promotional webinars, also contained
demonstrations of trading profits earned during these webinars using Pure Reason’s software
program.
-----------------
These profitable trading results, however, were based on hypothetical trades and there
was no disclaimer on the website or during the webinars that these were not actual trading
results.
-----------------
Cohen testified that she was aware that these profitable trade results were based on
hypothetical trades.
-----------------
False Statements Made To Commission
During the course of the Commission’s investigation of this matter, staff issued a demand
to Pure Reason to produce, in part, documents and/or other information substantiating claims on
Pure Reason’s website that Cohen had traded crude oil.
-----------------
In response, Pure Reason produced a
“Performance Summary” (“PS”) of a trading account from a futures commission merchant
(“FCM”) which according to counsel for Pure Reason and Cohen represented Cohen’s trading
history.
-----------------
The PS contained an account number but no account name.
-----------------
When staff contacted the
FCM for more information regarding this account, staff was informed that Cohen was not
associated with the account and was not authorized to trade the account.
-----------------
On October 22, 2014, Cohen testified, under oath, regarding the PS produced by Pure
Reason to Commission staff.
-----------------
Cohen testified that only she and her partner were authorized to
trade the account on the PS.
-----------------
When asked if the trades listed on the PS were trades she placed,
Cohen falsely testified, “Some.
-----------------
Not all.
-----------------
He [Cohen’s partner] traded, I traded, depending on the
day and the time and who was trading ...”- Commission staff further confirmed from Cohen’s
partner that neither he nor Cohen was authorized to trade the account reflected on the PS and that
he never in fact placed any trades for this account.
-----------------
iv.
-----------------
LEGAL DISCUSSION
A. Cohen Violated Section 6(c)(2) Of The Act
Section 6(c)(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
-----------------
§ 9(2) (2012), provides that it is unlawful “for any
person to make any false or misleading statement of a material fact to the Commission .
-----------------
.. or to
omit to state in any such statement any material fact that is necessary to make any statement of
material fact made not misleading in any material respect, if the person knew, or reasonably
should have known, the statement to be false or misleading.” During investigative testimony,
while under oath, Cohen made false and misleading statements to Commission staff regarding
her trading of an account that she never traded and that she never was authorized to trade.
-----------------
Cohen
knew or reasonably should have known that her statements were both false and misleading.
-----------------
Further, these statements were material because they went to the heart of a document that
Commission staff was analyzing pursuant to the Commission’s investigation of Respondents.
-----------------
B.","Pure Reason Violated Regulation 4.41(b)
Regulation 4.41(b), 17 C.F.R § 4.41(b), prohibits any person from presenting the
performance of any simulated or hypothetical commodity interest account, transaction or series
of transactions of a CTA unless the hypothetical disclaimer set forth in Regulation 4.41(b)(1)(i)
or (11) is disclosed.
-----------------
During the 2012-2013 period, Pure Reason, a registered CTA, promoted
profitable trading results from its software trading program on its website and webinars.
-----------------
These
profitable trading results, however, were based on hypothetical trades and there was no
disclaimer on the website or during the webinars that these were not actual trading results.
-----------------
By
this conduct, Pure Reason violated Regulation 4.41(b), 17 C.F.R § 4.41(b).
-----------------
CFTC v. Vartuli, 228
F.3d 94, 107 (2d Cir.
-----------------
2000) (phrasing and placement of disclosure appeared designed to mislead
and violated Regulation 4.41(b)).
-----------------
C, Derivative Liability
1.
-----------------
Cohen’s Controlling Person Liability
Cohen controlled Pure Reason and, as a controlling person, is liable for Pure Reason’s
violations of the Act and Regulations pursuant to Section 13(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
-----------------
§ 13c(b),
which provides that a person who, directly or indirectly, controls any person who has violated
any provision of the Act or any rule, regulation or order issued pursuant to the Act may be held
liable for such violation in any action brought by the Commission to the same extent as such
controlled person; the Commission has the burden of proving that the controlling person did not
act in good faith or knowingly induced, directly or indirectly, the act or acts constituting the
violation.

Section 4a(b)(2) of the Commodity Exchange Act (“Act”), 7 U.S.C.

Commission,
PLAINTIFF
V. ORDER
Robert S. Leben and Amy L. Leben,
DEFENDANTS
 
 
This matter comes before the Court on Plaintiff U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission’s (CFTC) motion for summary judgment, ECF No.
-----------------
25, and Defendants Robert and
Amy Leben’s cross-motion for summary judgment, ECF No.
-----------------
33.
-----------------
After careful consideration of
the applicable law, the evidence submitted by the parties, and the conduct to which Robert Leben
pled guilty in a related criminal case, the CFTC’s motion is granted and the Lebens’ cross-motion
is denied.
-----------------
FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
In January 2014, the CFTC filed this lawsuit seeking a permanent injunction, civil
monetary penalty, restitution, and disgorgement of funds against the Lebens based on their
operation of a Ponzi scheme that defrauded twelve investors of more than $2,000,000.
-----------------
ECF No.
-----------------
1.
-----------------
Specifically, the CFTC alleges the Lebens, through their company Structured Finance Group
(SFG), ran a fraudulent commodity pool in violation of certain provisions of the Commodity
Exchange Act (CEA) 7 U.S.C.
-----------------
§§ I et seg., and certain CFTC Regulations found at 17 C.F.R.
-----------------
§§
1.1 et seg.
-----------------
Id.
-----------------
At the outset of the proceedings, the Court granted the CFTC’s motion for a temporary
restraining order and, thereafter, granted the parties’ consent motion for a preliminary injunction.

ECF Nos.
-----------------
9, 15.
-----------------
These Orders prohibited the Lebens from, inter alia, trading or soliciting funds
to be traded on the commodity exchange.
-----------------
/d.
-----------------
In December 2014, the CFTC moved for summary judgment and a permanent injunction.
-----------------
ECF No.
-----------------
25.
-----------------
In support of its motion, the CFTC submitted sixty-one exhibits consisting of a
declaration from the special agent who investigated this matter, deposition transcripts, investment
contracts between the Lebens and investors (“Letter Agreements’’), emails, and bank records that
were collected during discovery.
-----------------
ECF Nos.
-----------------
25-1 through 25-61.
-----------------
In response to this motion, the
Lebens filed two affidavits that purport to create factual questions that would preclude granting
summary judgment to the CFTC.'
-----------------
ECF No.
-----------------
30-1.
-----------------
The Lebens also asserted they were not subject
to the provisions of the CEA because they were not actually running a commodity pool, and they
sought summary judgment on this ground.
-----------------
ECF No.
-----------------
33.
-----------------
The parties briefed these matters.
-----------------
ECF
Nos.
-----------------
27, 30, 32, 34, 35, and 38.
-----------------
The parties jointly sought to stay the case pending the resolution
of these motions, and the Court granted this request.
-----------------
ECF Nos.
-----------------
29, 31.
-----------------
On December 16, 2014, Robert Leben was indicted on fifteen counts of wire fraud under
 
' The Court notes that Robert Leben’s “affidavit” is neither sworn under the penalty of perjury nor
countersigned by the notary public named on the document.
-----------------
Moreover, Robert Leben
subsequently contradicted many of the assertions made in the “affidavit” when he pled guilty in a
criminal case arising from the same fraudulent conduct that gives rise to this case, discussed infra.
-----------------
The Court also notes the Lebens filed an affidavit signed by their agent who solicited investors,
Robert Semisch.
-----------------
ECF No.
-----------------
30-2.
-----------------
Mr. Semisch essentially attests that although the Letter
Agreements between SFG investors expressly state the “principal was secured for the full term,”
ECF No.
-----------------
30-3, the investors “understood” and were “aware” that their returns were actually based
on “best efforts.” ECF No.
-----------------
30-2 at {[ 4-8.
-----------------
Information concerning the investors’ understanding
and awareness is beyond personal knowledge of Mr. Semisch and, therefore, constitutes
inadmissible hearsay when presented in this form.
-----------------
See Fed.
-----------------
R. Evid.
-----------------
802.
-----------------
Moreover, Robert Leben
directly contradicted Mr. Semisch’s assertions when he admitted in the criminal matter that he
“guaranteed the investors’ principal” through the Letter Agreements.
-----------------
ECF No.
-----------------
42-3 at J 3(B).
-----------------
Therefore, Mr. Semisch’s affidavit fails to create a genuine question concerning the contractual
promises made by the Lebens to investors, and fails to create a genuine dispute concerning the
material facts asserted by the CFTC.

Robert Leben agreed to pay investors a rate of return of 8% to 16% a year, while
guaranteeing the investors’ principal by investing a portion in Treasury debt obligations.

The transactions were memorialized in Letter Agreements between SFG and investors.

* The remaining counts of the indictment were dismissed as a result of Robert Leben’s guilty plea.
-----------------
3 Though the criminal information does not name Robert Leben’s co-conspirators, the uncontested
evidence of record shows that he and Amy Leben jointly engaged in the fraudulent conduct that
gives rise to this action through their operation of SFG.
-----------------
Through his guilty plea, Robert Leben
admitted the fraud was committed through SFG.
-----------------
ECF No.
-----------------
42-3 at { 3(A).

Amy Leben testified
during her deposition that she was the sole owner of SFG and that she authorized Robert Leben to
run the company.
-----------------
ECF No.
-----------------
25-5 at 6.
-----------------
In his deposition, Robert Leben confirmed that Amy Leben
was SFG’s President, Vice President, Treasurer, and Secretary, and that they operated SFG out of
their house.

ECF No.

Further, Amy Leben admitted that she was the sole signatory
on the Merrill Lynch and Bank of America accounts that Robert Leben admitted were used to
divert the investor’s funds.

ECF No.
-----------------
25-5 at 13; ECF No.
-----------------
42-3 at { 3(C).
-----------------
In light of these facts,
and the additional evidence amassed by the CFTC, there is no basis to find a genuine issue of fact
that both Robert and Amy Leben engaged in the fraudulent conduct at issue here.

Rather than invest the money into AAA-rated U.S. Treasury debt obligations in the form of T-

LEGAL STANDARD
Summary Judgment
Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56, a party is entitled to summary judgment if
he “shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact” and that he “is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law.” A dispute is genuine “if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury
could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.” Anderson yv.

-----------------
As noted,
the Lebens did not respond to contest this argument.

After carefully reviewing the authorities
cited, the motions and memoranda from this case, and the relevant documents from the criminal
matter, the Court agrees that Robert Leben is precluded from relitigating the facts and issues he
admitted when he pled guilty because the elements of collateral estoppel are present here.

-----------------
DISCUSSION
In light of the standards set forth above, the Court has carefully considered the legal
authorities governing this matter and the evidence of record.
-----------------
When construing all facts and
reasonable inferences arising therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party as
required at this stage, the Court finds that the Lebens have presented insufficient evidence to
contradict the substantial evidence submitted by the CFTC.
-----------------
Moreover, as explained, Robert Leben
has now admitted to the fraudulent conduct that gives rise to this case by virtue of his guilty plea.
-----------------
Therefore, the Court concludes that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the
CFTC is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on each violation alleged.
-----------------
I.","Violations of the CEA and CFTC Regulations
In its supplemental brief, the CFTC asserts that Robert Leben’s admissions are sufficient
to show that he violated CEA §§ 6b(a)(1)(A)-(C), 60(1)(A) and (B), and 9(1), and 17 C.F.R.
-----------------
§
180.1(a)(1)-(3).
-----------------
ECF No.
-----------------
42 at 7.
-----------------
Additionally, the CFTC asserts that summary judgment should
be entered against Robert Leben on the remaining count against him—violation of CEA §§
6m(1)—for his failure to register as a commodity pool operator, and against Amy Leben on all
counts alleged, for the reasons set forth in its original motion and supporting memoranda.
-----------------
As
3:14-cv-00866-TLW _ Date Filed 08/05/16 Entry Number 44  ==Page 7 of 20
noted, the Lebens failed to contest the CFTC’s analysis concerning these violations in light of
Robert Leben’s guilty plea.
-----------------
The Court addresses each violation in turn below.
-----------------
a. CEA § 6b(a)(1)(A)-(C)
Under the CEA, it is unlawful for any person to (A) cheat or defraud or attempt to cheat or
defraud another person; (B) willfully to make or cause to be made to the other person any false
report or statement or willfully to enter or cause to be entered for the other person any false record;
or (C) willfully to deceive or attempt to deceive such other person by any means whatsoever, in
connection with any futures transaction.
-----------------
CEA §§ 6b(a)(1)(A)-(C).
-----------------
The evidence supports that the Lebens’ misappropriation of pool participants’ funds
violated §§ 6b(a)(1)(A) and (C).
-----------------
See CFTC v. Noble Wealth Data Info.
-----------------
Servs., Inc., 90 F. Supp.
-----------------
2d 676, 687 (D. Md.
-----------------
2000), aff'd in relevant part sub nom., CFTC v. Baragosh, 278 F.3d 319 (4th
Cir.
-----------------
2002) (defendant violated CEA § 6b by diverting investor funds for operating expenses and
personal use).
-----------------
By way of his guilty plea, Robert Leben admitted that SFG misappropriated at
least $2,000,000 in investor funds for the his personal use, while representing to investors that the
money would be used to purchase AAA-rated U.S. Treasury debt obligations and commodities.°
ECF No.
-----------------
42-3 at J 3(D).
-----------------
Instead, he used the money to purchase a house, vacations, a pool, an
irrigation system, a car, cosmetic surgery, to provide funds to family members, and to pay everyday
living expenses.
-----------------
/d.
-----------------
at { 3(C).
-----------------
Therefore, the Court concludes that the Lebens violated §§
6b(a)(1)(A) and (C) by misappropriating at least $2,000,000 in investor funds for their personal
use while representing to investors that the money would be used by SFG to purchase U.S.
Treasury debt obligations and commodities.
-----------------
© As noted, the uncontradicted evidence of record shows this conduct is attributable to both Robert
and Amy Leben because the fraudulent acts were committed through SFG, the company they
jointly ran out of their house.
-----------------
Robert Leben’s admissions in the criminal case also show that the Lebens violated §
6b(a)(1)(B).
-----------------
Delivering, or causing the delivery of, false statements or reports to pool participants
relating to transactions regulated by the CFTC constitutes a violation of CEA § 6b(a)(1)(B).
-----------------
See,
e.g., CFTC v. Weinberg, 287 F. Supp.
-----------------
2d 1100, 1108 (C.D.

misleading statements as to amount and location of investor money violated CEA §§ 6b); Noble
Wealth Data Info.
-----------------
Servs., 90 F. Supp.
-----------------
2d at 687.
-----------------
Robert Leben admitted that SFG distributed Letter
Agreements between SFG and investors wherein it agreed to pay investors a rate of return of 8%
to 16% a year, while guaranteeing the investors’ principal by investing a portion in Treasury debt
obligations.
-----------------
ECF No.
-----------------
42-3 at 7 3(B).
-----------------
As explained, these representations were false.
-----------------
Further,
these misrepresentations and omissions were material in that a reasonable pool participant would
want to know, among other things, the security of their principal investment and the annual returns
that were promised.
-----------------
Therefore, the Court concludes that the Lebens violated § 6b(a)(1)(B) by
distributing fraudulent and false material statements to investors.
-----------------
b. CEA § 9(1) and CFTC Regulation 180.1(a)(1)-(3)
It is unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, to use or employ any deceptive device
or contrivance in connection with, among other things, a futures contract.
-----------------
CEA § 9(1).
-----------------
In addition,
17 C.F.R.
-----------------
§180.1(a)(1)-(3) prohibits any person from intentionally or recklessly (1) using or
attempting to use any manipulative device, scheme or artifice to defraud; (2) making any untrue
or misleading statement or omission of material fact; and (3) engaging or attempting to engage in
any act or practice which operates as a fraud or deceit on any person.
-----------------
As stated, the Lebens misappropriated at least $2,000,000 in investor funds to personal use.
-----------------
ECF No.
-----------------
42-3 at J 3(D).
-----------------
Additionally, they distributed Letter Agreements between SFG and
investors wherein they agreed to pay investors a rate of return of 8% to 16% a year, while
 
guaranteeing the investors’ principal by investing a portion in Treasury debt obligations.
-----------------
ECF No.
-----------------
42-3 at { 3(B).
-----------------
The misappropriation of funds and issuance of false information concerning investors’
accounts constitute violations of CEA § 9(1) and 17 C.F.R.
-----------------
§180.1(a)(1)-@).
-----------------
See CFTC v. Global
Precious Metals Trading Co,.
-----------------
LLC, 2013 WL 5212237, at *5 (S.D.

Fla. Sept. 12, 2013) (defendant
violated CEA § 9(1) and 17 C.F.R.
-----------------
§ 180.1(a) by misappropriating funds and making
misrepresentations); CFTC v. Smithers, 2013 WL 4851684, at *8 (S.D.
-----------------
Fla. July 31, 2013) (same).
-----------------
Therefore, the Court concludes that the Lebens violated these provisions as well.
-----------------
c. CEA §§ 60(1)(A) and (B)
The CEA defines a Commodity Pool Operator (CPO) as any person who is:
engaged in a business that is of the nature of a commodity pool, investment trust,
syndicate, or similar form of enterprise, and who, in connection therewith, solicits,
accepts, or receives from others, funds, securities, or property, either directly or
through capital contributions, the sale of stock or other forms of securities, or
otherwise, for the purpose of trading in commodity interests, including any—
(1) commodity for future delivery, security futures product, or swap;
(II) agreement, contract, or transaction described in section 2(c)(2)(C)(i) of this title
or section 2(c)(2)(D)Q) of this title;
(III) commodity option authorized under section 6c of this title; or
(IV) leverage transaction authorized under section 23 of this title.
-----------------
CEA § la(11)G).
-----------------
Pursuant to CEA §§ 60(1)(A) and (B), it is unlawful for a CPO to use the mails
or any other means of interstate commerce to (1) employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud
any pool participant or prospective pool participant; or (11) engage in any transaction, practice or
course of business that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any pool participant or prospective pool
participant.
-----------------
The Lebens acted as CPOs by soliciting and accepting funds from investors who were
promised their funds would be invested in AAA-rated U.S. Treasury debt obligations and
commodities.
-----------------
ECF No.
-----------------
42-3 at J] 3(A)-(D).
-----------------
As explained, the Lebens [in their role as CPOs]
     
used interstate wire communications to defraud investors of at least $2,000,000 for their own
personal enrichment.
-----------------
ECF No.
-----------------
42-3 at] 2.
-----------------
Therefore, the Court concludes that the Lebens violated
the CEA §§ 60(1)(A) and (B).
-----------------
d. CEA § 6m(1)
Pursuant to CEA § 6m(1), it is unlawful for any CPO, unless registered, to make use of the
mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce in connection with its business.
-----------------
As
observed, the Lebens acted as CPOs and sent faxes and emails engaging in interstate commerce.
-----------------
ECE No.
-----------------
42-3 at Jf 3(A)-(D).
-----------------
Additionally, the Lebens admitted SFG was not registered with the
CFTC.
-----------------
ECF No.
-----------------
17 at J 13 (Lebens’ Answer).
-----------------
Therefore, the Court concludes that the Lebens
violated CEA § 6m(1).
-----------------
e. CFTC Regulation 4.20(b) and (c) (Amy Leben only)
Pursuant to 17 C.F.R.
-----------------
§ 4.20(b), all funds received by a CPO from a pool participant must
be accepted in the name of the pool, and the CPO may not accept funds in its own name.
-----------------
Under
17 C.F.R.
-----------------
§ 4.20(c), commodity pool funds may not be commingled with the funds of the CPO or
any other person.
-----------------
CFTC Investigator Michael Loconte submitted a declaration concerning his investigation
of the Lebens’ scheme.
-----------------
ECF No.
-----------------
25-1.
-----------------
He found that during the relevant period, Amy Leben
received funds from pool participants in accounts in her name.
-----------------
/d.
-----------------
at J 8 (Laconte Decl.).
-----------------
Investigator Loconte also uncovered that SFG accepted funds from pool participants and
transferred these funds to accounts owned or controlled by Amy Leben.
-----------------
/d.
-----------------
at { 9.
-----------------
Additionally, Robert Leben admitted through his guilty plea that he “diverted money for
their [Robert and Amy Leben’s] own use through accounts at Merrill Lynch and Bank of America,”
ECE No.
-----------------
42-3 at [ 3(C), and Amy Leben admitted during her deposition she was the sole signatory
10
     
on these accounts, ECF No.
-----------------
25-5 at 13.
-----------------
Therefore, the pool investor’s funds were commingled
with the Leben’s funds in violation of 17 C.F.R.
-----------------
§§ 4.20(b) and (c).
-----------------
f. Vicarious Liability for the Acts of the Lebens’ Agents
In its motion for summary judgment, the CFTC asserts that the Lebens are liable for the
acts of others, including Gary Bohlke and Robert Semisch, because they were agents of the Lebens
in the course of the Ponzi scheme.
-----------------
ECF No.
-----------------
25 at 30-31.
-----------------
The Lebens neither contested these
relationships, nor have they introduced sufficient evidence to create a genuine question on this
issue.
-----------------
Both the CEA and CFTC Regulations allow that a principal is vicariously liable for the
acts or omissions of his agent.
-----------------
CEA § 2(a)(1)(B) (stating that an “act, omission, or failure of any
official, agent, or other person acting for any individual, association, partnership, corporation, or
trust within the scope of his or her employment or office shall be deemed the act, omission, or
failure of such individual, association, partnership, corporation, or trust, as well as of such official,
agent, or other person’); 17 C.F.R.
-----------------
§ 1.2 (same).
-----------------
The acts of the Lebens’ agents occurred within the course and scope of their agency.
-----------------
Robert Leben testified during his deposition that Bohlke only disbursed funds at his direction and
instruction.
-----------------
ECF No.
-----------------
25-2 at 28.
-----------------
Likewise, Semisch referred his clients to SFG and communicated
the details of the “investment” on its behalf.
-----------------
ECF No.
-----------------
25-2 at 32-33; ECF No.
-----------------
25-7 at 28-29.
-----------------
Thus, Bohlke and Semisch acted as agents for the Lebens’ Ponzi scheme and, therefore, the Lebens
are liable as principals for their conduct pursuant to CEA § 2(a)(1)(B) and 17 C.F.R.
-----------------
§ 1.2.
-----------------
In sum, when the facts and reasonable inferences arising therefrom are viewed in the light
most favorable to the Lebens, there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the CFTC is
entitled to judgment as a matter of law on each count alleged.

SECTION 6(c) AND 6(d) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT,
MAKING FINDINGS AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS
I.
-----------------
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“Commission”) has reason to believe that
Simon Posen (“Posen” or “Respondent’’) violated Section 4c(a)(5)(C) of the Commodity
Exchange Act (“Act” or “CEA”), 7 U.S.C.
-----------------
§ 6c(a)(5)(C) (2012), from at least December 2011
through March 2015 (the “Relevant Period’).
-----------------
Therefore, the Commission deems it appropriate
and in the public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted to
determine whether Respondent engaged in the violations set forth herein and to determine
whether any order should be issued imposing remedial sanctions.
-----------------
Il.
-----------------
In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Respondent has
submitted an Offer of Settlement (“Offer’’) that the Commission has determined to accept.
-----------------
Without admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, Respondent consents to
the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Section 6(c) and 6(d) of the
Commodity Exchange Act, Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (“Order’’) and
acknowledges service of this Order.’
 
' Respondent consents to the entry of this Order and to the use of these findings in this proceeding and in any other
proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party; provided, however, that Respondent
does not consent to the use of the Offer or the findings or conclusions in this Order consented to in the Offer, as the
sole basis for any other proceeding brought by the Commission, other than a proceeding in bankruptcy or to enforce
the terms of this Order.
-----------------
Nor does Respondent consent to the use of the Offer or this Order, or the findings or
conclusions in this Order consented to in the Offer, by any other party in any other proceeding.
-----------------
II.","The Commission finds the following:
A.
-----------------
SUMMARY
During the period December 2011 through March 2015, Respondent engaged in the
disruptive practice of “spoofing” (bidding or offering with the intent to cancel the bid or offer
before execution) with respect to Crude Oil futures contracts traded on the New York Mercantile
Exchange (“NYMEX”) and Gold, Silver, and Copper Futures contracts traded on the Commodity
Exchange, Inc. ““COMEX’’).
-----------------
Posen’s spoofing orders, of which there were thousands during the
Relevant Period, violated Section 4c(a)(5)(C) of the Act.
-----------------
B. RESPONDENT
Simon Posen is a New York-based trader, who manually trades futures products on
NYMEX and COMEX.
-----------------
Posen is a member of NYMEX and COMEX, who during the Relevant
Period traded from home for his own account and was not employed by any corporate entity.
-----------------
Although he has previously held registrations as a floor trader and floor broker, Posen is not
currently registered with the Commission in any capacity.
-----------------
C. FACTS
Posen is a manual “point and click” trader who traded by computer from his New York
City apartment for his own account.
-----------------
He traded in futures markets, including Crude Oil, Gold,
Silver and Copper, during the period December 2011 through March 2015.
-----------------
Posen’s daily
activity volumes were at their highest during 2012 and were somewhat lower in late 2014 and
2015, after a hiatus in trading from February 2013 to August 2013.
-----------------
On a typical day, Posen
would enter hundreds of buy and sell orders in multiple products, with a focus on Crude Oil,
Gold, Silver, and Copper Futures contracts.
-----------------
Posen often traded during off-peak hours, when the
markets were less liquid, and would typically exit the market without holding onto any positions
at the end of his trading session each day.
-----------------
Posen repeatedly used the same trading pattern to spoof in the Crude Oil, Gold, Silver,
and Copper Futures markets: he would, within a matter of seconds: (1) place one or more large
orders or a series of layered orders (orders with gradually increasing or decreasing prices),
totaling 60 or more lots, on either the buy or sell side of the market, with the intent to cancel
these orders before execution; (2) shortly thereafter place one or more smaller orders of one to
ten lots, or “iceberg” orders (orders in which the size of the order is not visible to other market
participants) on the opposite side of the market; and (3) once the smaller order or “iceberg” order
was filled in whole or in part, cancel the original large or layered orders on the opposite side of
the market before those orders could be filled.
-----------------
Often, he would immediately repeat this pattern
in reverse to exit the position he had created and revert to being flat.
-----------------
Posen deployed this spoofing strategy on thousands of occasions during the Relevant
Period.
-----------------
In 2014 and 2015, Posen traded less frequently and he also reduced his use of “iceberg”
orders and tended to favor single, large-volume orders over the series of layered orders.
-----------------
However, Posen continued to place spoof orders until the end of the Relevant Period.”
IV.
-----------------
LEGAL DISCUSSION
Section 4c(a)(5)(C) of the Act—Spoofing Violations
Section 4c(a)(5) of the Act makes it unlawful for “[a]ny person to engage in any trading,
practice, or conduct on or subject to the rules of a registered entity that .. .
-----------------
is, is of the character
of, or is commonly known to the trade as, ‘spoofing’ (bidding or offering with the intent to
cancel the bid or offer before execution).” As described above, Posen entered into thousands of
bids or offers on a registered entity with the intent to cancel the bids or offers before execution in
violation of Section 4c(a)(5)(C) of the Act.

The Commission finds the following:
A.
-----------------
Summary
Beginning in or about May 2007 and continuing through at least August 2012 (the
“Relevant Period’), BNPP, by and through certain of its traders, attempted to manipulate the
U.S. Dollar International Swaps and Derivatives Association Fix (“USD ISDAFIX” or the
““benchmark’’), a leading global benchmark referenced in a range of interest rate products, to
benefit BNPP’s derivatives positions in instruments such as cash-settled options on interest rate
swaps and certain exotic structured products.”
ISDAFIX rates and spreads were published daily and were meant to indicate the
prevailing mid-market rate, at a specific time of day, for the fixed leg of a standard fixed-for-
floating interest rate swap.” They were issued in several currencies.
-----------------
USD ISDAFIX rates and
spreads were published for various maturities of U.S.
-----------------
Dollar-denominated swaps, including 1-
year to 10-years, 15-years, 20-years, and 30-years.
-----------------
The most widely used USD ISDAFIX rates
and spreads, and the ones at issue in this Order, were those that are intended to indicate the
prevailing market rate as of 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time.
-----------------
The 11:00 am.
-----------------
USD ISDAFIX rate was
used for cash settlement of options on interest rate swaps, or swaptions, and as a valuation tool
for certain other interest rate products, including, for example, various proprietary interest rate
indices and structured products.
-----------------
During the Relevant Period, USD ISDAFIX was set each day in a process that began at
11:00 a.m. Eastern Time with the capture and recording of swap rates and spreads from a U.S.
based unit of a leading interest rate swaps broking firm (“Swaps Broker’).
-----------------
Swaps Broker
disseminated rates and spreads captured in this snapshot as references to a panel of banks.
-----------------
These
reference points taken at 11:00 a.m. (which were calculated using swap spread trade data from
Swaps Broker, U.S. Treasuries electronic trade data from Swaps Broker, and Eurodollar futures
data at or around 11:00 a.m.) were sometimes referred to as the “fix” or “print” by traders and
brokers.
-----------------
After the 11:00 a.m. reference rates and spreads were disseminated by Swaps Broker to
the panel banks, the panel banks then made submissions to Swaps Broker.
-----------------
Each bank’s
submission was supposed to reflect the midpoint of where that dealer would itself offer and bid a
swap to a dealer of good credit as of 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time.
-----------------
Most banks on the panel,
including BNPP, usually submitted Swaps Broker’s reference rates and spreads as captured in
the snapshot.
-----------------
As a result, after an averaging of the submissions, the reference rates and spreads
became the published USD ISDAFIX almost every day.
-----------------
* While the Relevant Period extends from in or about May 2007 through at least August 2012, a substantial majority
of the violations occurred before 2011, of which most were in 2008.
-----------------
3 In 2014, the administration of ISDAFIX changed, and a new version of the benchmark is published under a
different name by a new administrator using a different methodology.
-----------------
On certain days on which BNPP had a derivatives position settling or resetting against
USD ISDAFIX, certain individuals at BNPP attempted to manipulate USD ISDAFIX rates
through trading at the 11:00 a.m. fixing and, on occasion, by making false submissions to Swaps
Broker that were skewed to benefit derivatives positions held by BNPP.
-----------------
BNPP’s unlawful
conduct involved multiple traders, including supervisors such as the then-heads of the relevant
BNPP swaps and options desks in the United States.
-----------------
First, certain BNPP traders bid, offered, and executed transactions in targeted interest rate
products, including swap spreads, at or near the critical 11:00 a.m. fixing time with the intent to
affect the reference rates and spreads captured by Swaps Broker and sent to submitting banks,
and thereby to affect the published USD ISDAFIX.
-----------------
As captured in contemporaneous
communications, on some occasions when BNPP had derivatives positions settling or pricing
against USD ISDAFIX, its traders discussed, both among themselves and with Swaps Broker
employees, their intent to move USD ISDAFIX rates in whichever direction benefitted their
positions.
-----------------
Certain BNPP traders on occasion described such attempts to manipulate USD
ISDAFIX as ways to “play the fixing,” “push the screen,” and “play[] the screen game.”* On
one occasion, BNPP options and swaps traders likened their illegal efforts to manipulate USD
ISDAFIX to lyrics of popular songs:
BNPP Options Trader: that’s a great fixing
BNPP Swaps Trader: this is how we do it here :-P”
BNPP Options Trader: push it real good®
Second, on occasion, certain traders at BNPP attempted to manipulate USD ISDAFIX by
making false submissions to Swaps Broker for BNPP as a panel bank, skewing the rates and
spreads submitted in the direction that could have moved the USD ISDAFIX setting to benefit
BNPP’s trading positions.
-----------------
A bank’s derivatives trading positions or profitability are not
legitimate or permissible factors on which to base submissions in connection with a benchmark.
-----------------
Yet on occasion within the Relevant Period, BNPP traders made USD ISDAFIX submissions
higher or lower than the reference values disseminated by Swaps Broker for the purpose of
benefitting derivatives positions priced or valued against the benchmark.
-----------------
On these occasions,
BNPP’s USD ISDAFIX submissions constituted false, misleading, or knowingly inaccurate
reports because they purported to reflect BNPP’s honest view of the true costs of entering into a
standard fixed-for-floating interest rate swap in a particular tenor with another dealer of good
credit in the interdealer market, but in fact reflected traders’ desire to move USD ISDAFIX
higher or lower in order to benefit BNPP’s positions.
-----------------
These submissions were false, misleading,
or knowingly inaccurate because they did not report where BNPP would itself bid or offer
 
Unless otherwise indicated, quotations in this Order are drawn from communications, typically emails and instant
messages, between and among traders and brokers during the Relevant Period.

C, Facts
1.
-----------------
USD ISDAFIX Setting
USD ISDAFIX rates and spreads were benchmarks that indicated prevailing market rates
for “plain-vanilla” interest rate swaps.’ The 11:00 a.m. USD ISDAFIX was set during the
Relevant Period using a combination of swap spread trade data from Swaps Broker,® electronic
trading in U.S. Treasuries and Eurodollar futures, and submissions from a panel of swap dealer
banks, including BNPP.
-----------------
Swaps Broker’s medium-term USD swap desk (“MTS Desk’’) functioned much like a
traditional futures trading pit.
-----------------
Brokers on the desk sat (or stood) together and each serviced a
number of major swap dealer banks, to whom they were connected throughout the trading day by
direct phone lines and speaker boxes.
-----------------
The brokers communicated their clients’ bids and offers
 
7 The term “swap” is defined in CEA Section 1a(47), 7 U.S.C.
-----------------
§ 1a(47) (2012).
-----------------
Here, a “plain-vanilla” interest rate
swap is generally an ongoing exchange of fixed payments for floating payments, wherein one party to a swap pays a
fixed rate on a set notional amount (the party who “pays fixed” is said to have “bought” the swap, or to be “long”
the swap) and the other party pays a floating rate generally tied to three-month LIBOR (the party who “receives
fixed” is said to have “sold” the swap, or to be “short” the swap).
-----------------
The “maturity” or “tenor” of a swap refers to the
number of years over which counterparties exchange payments.
-----------------
* An interest rate swap spread trade consists of a fixed-for-floating interest rate swap and an offsetting trade in U.S.
Treasuries of the same maturity, which can be used to hedge part of the interest rate risk associated with the fixed-
for-floating interest rate swap.
-----------------
The difference in basis points between the U.S. Treasury yield and the swap rate
constitutes the “spread” quoted in a spread trade.
-----------------
The party who “receives fixed” in a swap and sells U.S. Treasuries
to hedge is “short” spreads or has “sold” spreads, while a party who “pays fixed” in a swap and buys Treasuries to
hedge is “long” spreads or has “bought” spreads.
-----------------
by open outcry to the entire MTS Desk and all of the brokers simultaneously.
-----------------
Any client could
accept a bid or offer.
-----------------
Once a broker confirmed that a client was “hitting” a bid, “lifting” an offer,
or was otherwise “done” in a designated notional amount (either a minimum default amount or a
greater amount), the trade between the counterparties was executed and the counterparties
received a confirmation of the trade.
-----------------
Swaps Broker published a live feed of transaction data for USD interest rate swap
spreads, swap rates, and U.S. Treasury yields and prices to an electronic screen, known as the
“19901 screen,” accessible through a subscription-based market news service.
-----------------
The 19901 screen
reflected the levels at which those products were trading through the MTS Desk (for swap
spreads and swap rates) and Swaps Broker’s proprietary electronic trading platform (for U.S.
Treasury securities).
-----------------
The levels displayed on the 19901 screen for swap spreads were manually
controlled by an employee of the Swaps Broker, known colloquially as the “screen guy” or
“screen operator,” who would toggle the levels up or down based on the swap spread trading
activity that occurred before him on the MTS Desk.
-----------------
The 19901 screen is a reference used widely
throughout the financial industry by swap dealer banks, hedge funds, asset managers, businesses,
and other participants in interest rate markets.
-----------------
During the Relevant Period, levels displayed on
the 19901 screen at precisely 11:00 a.m. were critical because they were used to set USD
ISDAFIX.
-----------------
To set USD ISDAFIX rates for the 2-year through 30-year maturities, Swaps Broker first
generated reference rates and spreads from the snapshot of 11:00 a.m. 19901 screen prices,
reflecting either the last traded spread or the mid-point between the most recent executable bid
and offer.
-----------------
Swaps Broker’s reference rates, for all maturities except the l-year, were the sum of
the reference spread and the 19901 screen’s U.S. Treasury yield in the corresponding maturity.
-----------------
To generate the 1-year reference rate (for which there was no associated swap spread), Swaps
Broker utilized a combination of Eurodollar futures yields (based on trading on CME’s Globex
platform) and broker “sentiment,” which was intended to reflect prevailing rates for 1-year swaps
based on trading though Swaps Broker’s short-term swap desk.
-----------------
Minutes after the 11:00 a.m. snapshot of the 19901 was taken, Swaps Broker distributed
its reference rates and spreads to a panel of fourteen or more contributing banks, which either
accepted and submitted the reference rates and spreads as their own or submitted adjusted levels.
-----------------
Each bank, including BNPP, was expected to submit “the mean of where that dealer would itself
offer and bid a swap in the relevant maturity for a notional equivalent amount of USD $50
million or whatever amount is deemed market size in that currency for that maturity to an
acknowledged dealer of good credit in the swap market.”” In making their submissions, banks
could change the prices for all rates and spreads across all maturities in their submissions;
change any subset, including any single rate or spread; or change none at all and simply submit
the reference rates and spreads.
-----------------
Alternatively, a panel bank could make no submission at all.
-----------------
After a quorum of contributing banks made their submissions, a calculation agent eliminated the
highest and lowest submissions (known as “topping and tailing”) and averaged the remaining
 
° See ISDA, ISDAFIX, https://web.archive.org/web/20140209 180148/http:/www2.isda.org/asset-classes/interest-
rates-derivatives/isdafix/.
-----------------
submissions.
-----------------
The submission and calculation process was generally completed in the half hour
following 11:00 a.m., after which the results were accessible to the public through a
subscription-based news service.
-----------------
In practice, most panel banks accepted Swaps Broker’s reference rates and spreads as
their default submissions.
-----------------
Thus, as traders at panel banks knew, after “topping and tailing,”
Swaps Broker’s reference rates and spreads usually became the final published USD ISDAFIX
benchmarks.
-----------------
BNPP traders at times communicated with Swaps Broker’s MTS Desk just after
11:00 a.m. to find out where the “print” came out, because the traders understood that the 11:00
a.m. levels usually became the final published USD ISDAFIX benchmarks.
-----------------
2.
-----------------
BNPP’s Trading Groups
Through the Interest Rate Trading group of BNPP’s Fixed Income division, BNPP traded
interest rate swaps, swaptions, exotic interest-rate derivatives, U.S. Treasuries, and a variety of
other products.
-----------------
Within that trading group, BNPP’s U.S. Dollar Long Term Interest Rate desk
(the “Swaps Desk’’) transacted and held, among other products, swaps positions.
-----------------
Another desk
within that trading group, BNPP’s USD Interest Rates Options trading desk (the “Options
Desk’), transacted and held, among other products, vanilla swaption and exotics option
positions.
-----------------
A third desk within the group, BNPP’s U.S. Treasuries trading desk (the ““Treasuries
Desk’’) transacted and held, among other products, U.S. Treasuries positions.
-----------------
In New York,
these desks were generally located in close proximity.
-----------------
3.
-----------------
BNPP’s Role in USD ISDAFIX Setting
Throughout the Relevant Period, BNPP was one of the panel banks that submitted rates
and spreads for the determination of USD ISDAFIX.
-----------------
The Swaps Desk had primary
responsibility for the U.S. Dollar swaps business, and an individual on the Swaps Desk, typically
the most junior trader, was responsible for BNPP’s USD ISDAFIX submissions.
-----------------
Before January 2011, when BNPP made a submission to the ISDAFIX dealer poll, the
Swaps Desk typically, though not always, ratified the reference rates and spreads disseminated
by Swaps Broker based on the 11:00 a.m. “snapshot.” Between January 2011 and June 2012,
BNPP generally made no submissions at all.
-----------------
Before early 2013, BNPP either had no, or did not have adequate, specific internal
controls or procedures, written or otherwise, in place regarding how USD ISDAFIX submissions
should be determined or monitored.
-----------------
BNPP ISDAFIX submitters received no formal training on
making USD ISDAFIX submissions, and BNPP did not require submissions to be documented.
-----------------
4.
-----------------
BNPP’s Positions with Exposure to USD ISDAFIX
As described in more detail below, BNPP traders engaged in attempts to manipulate USD
ISDAFIX for two primary reasons: (1) to maximize profit (or minimize loss) for the Options
Desk in connection with the desk’s swaption cash settlements; and (2) to maximize profit (or
minimize loss) for the Options Desk in connection with exotics positions, including various
constant maturity swap (“CMS”) products.
-----------------
BNPP traders’ attempts to move USD ISDAFIX rates in BNPP’s favor, if successful,
would hurt the firm’s counterparties in cash settlements and resets, as well as any other market
participants who had positions referencing USD ISDAFIX on a given day that were directionally
equivalent to BNPP’s counterparties’ in the same maturity.
-----------------
A small movement of the benchmark
higher or lower (e.g., one basis point or less) could result in meaningful gain for BNPP on its
cash settlements, resets, and accruals.
-----------------
a.
-----------------
Vanilla Swaption Positions Held by the Options Desk
During the Relevant Period, certain traders on BNPP’s Options Desk, in coordination
with certain traders on the Swaps Desk, attempted to manipulate USD ISDAFIX in order to
benefit the Options Desk’s derivatives positions, such as by increasing their payments from
counterparties, or decreasing payments to counterparties, in swaption cash settlements.
-----------------
A European swaption, one of the products traded by the Options Desk, is an option to
enter into a plain-vanilla fixed-for-floating interest rate swap, which may be exercised at 11:00
a.m. on a specified “expiry” date in the future at a pre-agreed fixed “strike” rate.
-----------------
A swaption can
be exercised by “physical” delivery of the underlying swap, or by cash settlement in reference to
a benchmark rate.
-----------------
Swaption cash settlements denominated in U.S.
-----------------
Dollars are typically
calculated based on USD ISDAFIX rates according to a formula that measures the difference
between the relevant USD ISDAFIX rate on the expiry date and the strike rate of the swaption.
-----------------
In any cash-settling swaption, the Options Desk’s incentive to push USD ISDAFIX higher or
lower depended on (1) whether BNPP was the owner (buyer) or seller of the swaption and (2)
whether the swaption conferred the right to pay or receive the fixed rate in the underlying swap.
-----------------
The Options Desk also traded products consisting of combinations of swaptions, such as
straddles, and other products for which cash settlements were similarly calculated based on the
relevant USD ISDAFIX rate at expiry and therefore created similar incentives for BNPP traders
to attempt to push USD ISDAFIX rates in the firm’s favor.
-----------------
b. Exotics Positions Held by the Options Desk
During the Relevant Period, traders on BNPP’s Options Desk, in coordination with the
Swaps Desk, also attempted to manipulate USD ISDAFIX in order to benefit the desks’
derivatives positions in connection with various exotic derivatives instruments, such as the
periodic resets and settlements of CMS products.”
 
'° A “constant maturity swap,” or “CMS,” is a swap in which the rate of one leg of the swap is periodically reset (or
“fixed”) with reference to a long-term interest rate.
-----------------
The BNPP Options Desk held numerous CMS positions during
the Relevant Period that periodically reset with reference to USD ISDAFIX.
-----------------
The BNPP Options Desk’s positions
included not only vanilla or “building block” positions, but also more sophisticated exotic products such as CMS
spread swaps, various path-dependent and range-accrual products, and volatility or correlation products.
-----------------
On reset or
“fixing” days, depending on the terms of a given CMS product, the BNPP Options Desk could benefit from causing
the relevant USD ISDAFIX rate to set higher or lower.
-----------------
BNPP traders were sensitive to their profits and losses in
connection with CMS resets.
-----------------
BNPP options traders managed exotics positions priced or fixed based on the 11:00 a.m.
USD ISDAFIX, including tracking what traders called “fixing P&L,” 1.e., the profit or loss of
certain exotics positions attributable to the day’s USD ISDAFIX.
-----------------
At times during the Relevant
Period, BNPP’s exposure in connection with the 10-year, 30-year 11:00 am.
-----------------
USD ISDAFIX
curve—meaning the difference, or spread, between the 10-year and 30-year levels—could be
substantial.
-----------------
For example, a communication among BNPP options traders reflects that certain of
BNPP’s exotics positions in 2008 benefited in the amount of roughly $700,000 each day that the
10-year, 30-year fixing was below zero (1.e., when the 10-year USD ISDAFIX level exceeded
the 30-year USD ISDAFIX level, sometimes described as when the 10-year, 30-year curve was
“inverted’’).
-----------------
5.
-----------------
Means Employed in BNPP’s Attempts To Manipulate USD ISDAFIX
Given these financial incentives, certain BNPP traders understood and employed two
primary means to attempt to manipulate USD ISDAFIX rates.
-----------------
One method was to bid, offer, and
trade the instruments that could influence Swaps Broker’s reference rates—such as swap spreads
traded through Swaps Broker—at and around Swaps Broker’s 11:00 a.m. print, in a manner
designed to push USD ISDAFIX rates in a favorable direction.
-----------------
Another method employed on
some occasions by certain BNPP traders in attempts to manipulate USD ISDAFIX rates was
making false submissions.
-----------------
Using each of these means, at times independently and at times in combination, BNPP
traders sought the same illicit goal: to move USD ISDAFIX in the direction that was best for
BNPP at the expense of its counterparties, including at times other dealers.
-----------------
a. BNPP’s Improper Trading Conduct
As described below, BNPP traders attempted to manipulate USD ISDAFIX through
improper trading conduct relating to the inputs to Swaps Broker’s 11:00 a.m. reference values.
-----------------
Such trading strategies at times were a regular practice at BNPP, and some supervisors were not
only aware of subordinates executing such trading strategies, but at times executed them directly.
-----------------
During the Relevant Period, in order to benefit the Options Desk’s related positions,
BNPP traders bid, offered, and/or executed swap spread trades’!
-----------------
at or around 11:00 a.m. to affect
prices on the 19901 screen and thereby increase or decrease Swaps Broker’s reference rates and
spreads and influence the final published USD ISDAFIX.
-----------------
| There is also evidence that, on occasion, certain BNPP traders also bid, offered, and/or executed trades in U.S.
Treasuries on Swaps Broker’s proprietary electronic bond trading platform (for 2-year through 30-year maturities) in
attempts to increase or decrease Swaps Broker’s reference rates and spreads and thereby to influence the final
published USD ISDAFIX.
-----------------
'?
-----------------
BNPP traders referred to trades that they made around 11:00 a.m. for risk management purposes as hedging.
-----------------
When BNPP’s derivatives products cash-settled, reset, or otherwise fixed to a benchmark, changes in the desks’ risk
positions could potentially cause traders to seek hedging trades, depending on a variety of factors, including the risk
profile of other positions and whether the desk wanted to keep any resulting risk.
-----------------
Likewise, with internal USD
Internally, BNPP traders recognized that “11am print manipulation” could present both
risks and opportunities for the bank, including for sophisticated exotics positions that the Options
Desk held, such as correlation and volatility swaps.
-----------------
BNPP traders explicitly coordinated their
efforts to influence the 11:00 a.m. USD ISDAFIX in accordance with the preferences expressed
by BNPP options traders.
-----------------
For example, in group chats among BNPP options traders, swaps
traders, and Treasuries traders, in reference to the fixing of the 10-year and 30-year 11:00 a.m.
USD ISDAFIX curve, !° BNPP options traders stated:
e “for 1l am...
-----------------
I'd like the 10s30s to be as steep as
possibl[e]”
e “we’re going to have 250k on the 1lam today... we want
the finxing [sic] to be as steep as possible”
e “at 1lam we want to fix as low as possible”
To move USD ISDAFIX in the direction or directions desired by the Options Desk,
BNPP swaps traders at times strategized with Swaps Broker employees, whose help the traders
enlisted to accomplish their goals.
-----------------
For example, on various occasions, BNPP swaps traders
discussed with Swaps Broker employees the traders’ intention to achieve certain swap spread
screen prints or directional moves at 11:00 a.m., rather than a desire to buy or sell a specific
amount of swap spreads.
-----------------
For instance, one Swaps Broker employee and a BNPP swaps trader
discussed how “the easiest way to accomplish the screen print is by hitting the bid and keeping
offered at the hit price.” To affect the USD ISDAFIX print more effectively and at minimal cost,
BNPP swaps traders also typically timed their trading activity to try to be the last screen-moving
event before the 11:00 a.m. print.
-----------------
For example, at various times during the Relevant Period,
BNPP swaps traders discussed with their broker how to achieve the desired screen moves for the
11:00 a.m. print through careful timing:
Swaps Broker The fixing is set at 11:00:00 not before .
-----------------
.
-----------------
.
-----------------
if
employee: u want to move the screen, [BNPP’s primary
broker at Swaps Broker] was_ probably
suggesting u start at 10:59:50
BNPP I see.
-----------------
thanks
swaps trader:
 
ISDAFIX-related trades between desks, the desk taking on new risk, depending on a variety of factors, might have a
reason or desire to hedge.
-----------------
Irrespective of whether the BNPP traders had an interest in hedging, the traders engaged
in attempted manipulation when they placed bids and offers or executed trades around 11:00 a.m. with the improper
intent to move the USD ISDAFIX rate in BNPP’s favor.
-----------------
'’ The 10-year, 30-year swap curve—the line between those two points—is said to “steepen” if the slope of the line
between the 10-year and 30-year points increases, and to “flatten” if the slope of between the 10-year and 30-year
points decreases.
-----------------
Relatedly, a “steepener’” position profits when the swap curve steepens, and a “flattener’” position
profits when the swap curve flattens.
-----------------
Similarly, another of BNPP’s brokers at Swaps Broker wrote to a BNPP Swaps Desk trader
advising on how to best time trades to achieve a desired swap spread level at 11:00 a.m.: “U
MIGHT HAVE TO HIT OR LIFT AT 10.59 -55 SEC TO MAKE SURE NO ONE HAS TIME
TO C[OJUNTER IT.”
When BNPP’s brokers failed to achieve the desired effects on the 11:00 a.m. print level,
BNPP traders occasionally were forgiving.
-----------------
For example, on a day where the Swaps Broker
employee at the BNPP swaps trader’s direction had attempted to push up the 11:00 a.m. print in
order to benefit BNPP’s related positions, but failed to do so, the BNPP swaps trader graciously
accepted an apology:
Swaps SRY MAN ,I TRIED TO PUSH IT UP
Broker employee:
BNPP swaps trader: that’s ok - as long as you do your max it’s
all good
On other occasions, BNPP swaps traders made their sharp disapproval clear.
-----------------
For example, a
BNPP trader terminated all dealings with a Swaps Broker employee in large part because,
according to the BNPP trader, the broker “missed the screen game.”’ On another occasion, a
BNPP swaps trader angrily complained to primary broker at Swaps Broker that the trader was
being mocked by traders at other dealers for not being able to play the screen game successfully.
-----------------
As a consequence, the trader wrote to the broker at Swaps Broker threatening to penalize the
broker by not trading at all with the broker for a period of time: “my short term guy got a
bloomberg from his friend at [another dealer] teasing him about me saying about us and our
inability to play screen games.
-----------------
very flattering .... You’re out!” Reflecting on the heated
interactions that often surrounded the critical 11:00 a.m. fixing time, a BNPP trader remarked to
a Swaps Broker employee: “the infamous 11 o’clock!
-----------------
[T]here should be a book about it.”
In attempts to push USD ISDAFIX higher or lower, BNPP traders were even willing at
times to buy higher or sell lower than the market required because they expected to benefit the
Options Desk’s cash settlements or resets to an extent that would likely exceed, but at least
cover, any resulting trading losses incurred through such trading.
-----------------
Similarly, BNPP traders at
times were willing to enter into positions that increased rather than decreased their risk
exposure—t.e., the opposite of hedging—because the anticipated benefits of moving the USD
ISDAFIX rate or rates in BNPP’s favor exceeded any likely downside to BNPP.
-----------------
BNPP traders
at times were explicit about the fact that risk mitigation played little or no role in their decision to
trade at or around 11:00 a.m.
-----------------
The following exchange reflects (1) BNPP traders’ understanding
that the bank would benefit from a “flatter” 11:00 a.m. USD ISDAFIX curve (1.e., a higher 10-
year fixing relative to the 30-year fixing); (2) the fact that the Options Desk already held a
flattener position, and so risk would be increased, not mitigated, by entering into further flattener
positions; and (3) the intent to engage in additional trading, not for the purpose of risk mitigation,
but rather for the purpose of moving the relevant USD ISDAFIX levels in the desired direction:
10
BNPP swaps trader: what about |lam ?
-----------------
obviously you need
it flatter right ?
-----------------
BNPP options trader: Yes....
BNPP swaps trader: ok
BNPP options trader: but we have little risk to trade
BNPP swaps trader: yeah bad day today, you need it flatter
but you already have the flattener
BNPP options trader: exactly
BNPP swaps trader: we'll try to make it happen for you...
will try to use the smallest amount for
11[.]
-----------------
Within the bank, certain BNPP traders openly discussed the practice of trying to move
market levels in order to benefit the Options Desk’s positions.
-----------------
For example, in widely
distributed end-of-day e-mails sent to numerous BNPP traders and supervisors including heads
of desks, a BNPP options trader explicitly reported the BNPP options and swaps desks’
coordinated efforts to move 10-year and 30-year USD ISDAFIX rates for the benefit of the
options desk’s positions.
-----------------
One such e-mail stated: “We did well on the 11am fixing, cooperating
with the swaps desk to push the screen substantially towards yesterday fixing.” In another
broadly distributed e-mail, a BNPP options trader wrote: “Swaps did a good job of pushing the
10-30 fixing to the high of the day with little ammo.” *
b. BNPP’s False, Misleading, or Knowingly Inaccurate
Submissions
During the Relevant Period, on occasion before December 2010, certain BNPP traders
also attempted to manipulate USD ISDAFIX by causing the firm to make false, misleading, or
knowingly inaccurate submissions to Swaps Broker concerning swap rates and spreads.
-----------------
For example, in July 2009, on a day when a BNPP options trader stood to benefit from a
favorable one-year USD ISDAFIX move, the options trader wrote to the BNPP swaps trader who
would make the submission to confirm the trader was “contributing the ly swap rate ISA DIX
[sic] at lam” and to request an improper submission in that tenor in order to benefit a related
swaption cash settlement:
just have a cash settlement today on an option, if it does not hurt
you, do you mind sending a high number ?
-----------------
(I mean high rate) ....
 
’ The words “ammo” and “ammunition” on occasion were used by BNPP traders to refer to the amount they were
willing to trade in order to influence the fixing at 11:00 a.m.
11
if you can do anything, would rather see a high fixing on the ly
swap rate at |lam[.]
-----------------
After confirming details with the BNPP options trader making the request, the BNPP swaps
trader changed BNPP’s submission in order to favor the Options Desk’s related position.
-----------------
The
options trader replied, “ok cool, thanks a lot !” The swaps trader responded, “np,” an
abbreviation of “no problem.”
Multiple BNPP Options Desk traders engaged in communications about USD ISDAFIX
submissions with BNPP Swaps Desk traders, and supervisors on the Swaps Desk and Options
Desk were aware of such requests and their connection to swaption cash settlements and/or CMS
resets.
-----------------
When a request from the Options Desk for a high or low submission occurred before
11:00 a.m., the timing in itself revealed that the submission requested could not have been an
accurate reflection of where BNPP saw the swap market at 11:00 a.m.
6.
-----------------
Additional Examples of Attempted Manipulation To Benefit the
Options Desk’s ISDAFIX-Related Derivatives Positions
During the Relevant Period, BNPP traders on the Swaps Desk and the Options Desk used
various means in attempts to move USD ISDAFIX higher or lower, in order to get more from, or
pay less to, their counterparties in cash-settled swaptions and other derivatives, such as CMS
products, that referenced USD ISDAFIX.
-----------------
The following provide further examples and details of
BNPP traders’ attempts to manipulate USD ISDAFIX rates in order to benefit derivatives
positions that were tied to USD ISDAFIX that day.
-----------------
e In April 2008, the Options Desk stood to benefit from a steeper 10-year, 30-year
11:00 am.
-----------------
USD ISDAFIX curve (1.e., a lower 10-year level relative to a higher 30-
year level) because of the desk’s CMS positions.
-----------------
Communicating the desired effect
on USD ISDAFIX, a BNPP options trader wrote in a group chat including several
BNPP options, swaps, and Treasuries traders: “‘a heads up... we’re probably going
to have around 300k riding on the 10s30s fixing today .. .
-----------------
we will hope the fixing is
as high as possible at 11.””> A BNPP swaps trader repeated with emphasis, “ok you
need the fixing to be AS HIGH AS POSSIBLE,” and the options trader confirmed,
“correct.” The swaps trader then stated, “1 got you — we’ll play it.””’ BNPP traders
then acted in concert to try to achieve the desired fixing.
-----------------
First, attempting to
manipulate USD ISDAFIX, shortly before 11:00 a.m., the BNPP swaps trader traded
30-year swaps spreads through Swaps Broker, thereby putting upward pressure on the
30-year USD ISDAFIX and thus steepening pressure on the 10-year, 30-year USD
ISDAFIX curve.
-----------------
Second, also shortly before 11:00 a.m., a BNPP Treasuries trader
bought 10-year Treasuries and sold 30-year Treasuries, putting downward pressure on
the 10-year USD ISDAFIX and upward pressure on the 30-year USD ISDAFIX, and
thus steepening pressure on the 10-year, 30-year USD ISDAFIX curve.
-----------------
Finally,
shortly after 11:00 a.m., the BNPP swaps desk also submitted 30-year spreads and
rates that were higher than the reference values distributed by Swaps Broker in an
attempt to push USD ISDAFIX in that maturity in the direction that would benefit
BNPP.
-----------------
12
In May 2008, the Options Desk stood to benefit from a lower 30-year 11:00 a.m.
USD ISDAFIX because of the desk’s CMS positions.
-----------------
To convey the desired effect
on the relevant USD ISDAFIX tenor, a BNPP options trader wrote in a group chat
involving BNPP options, swaps, and Treasuries traders: “FYI, we want 30y low for
the fixing.” In reply, a BNPP swaps trader inquired into how much the options trader
was willing to trade in order to achieve the desired lower 30-year USD ISDAFIX:
“how much ammo do you have?” Then, shortly before 11:00 a.m., in order to benefit
the Options Desk’s position, BNPP Swaps Desk traders engaged in the selling of 30-
year swap spreads through Swaps Broker, thereby putting downward pressure on the
30-year USD ISDAFIX.
-----------------
Shortly after 11:00 a.m., the BNPP Swaps Desk also
submitted 30-year spreads and rates that were lower than the reference values
distributed by Swaps Broker in an attempt to push 30-year USD ISDAFIX in the
direction that would benefit BNPP.
-----------------
Later that day, a BNPP options trader wrote to a
BNPP swaps trader to express appreciation for efforts relating to the day’s “screen
game’: “thank you very much for your help today.
-----------------
[Y]ou were terrific.”
In August 2008, the Options Desk stood to benefit from a steeper 10-year, 30-year
11:00 a.m. USD ISDAFIX curve (i.e., a lower 10-year rate relative to a higher 30-
year rate) because of the desk’s CMS positions.
-----------------
Before 11:00 a.m., the Swaps Desk
and Options Desk traders discussed their plan to manipulate USD ISDAFIX.
-----------------
First, a
Swaps Desk trader confirmed with an Options Desk trader both the desired effect on
the 10-year, 30-year ISDAFIX curve (“you'll need steeper”) and the fact that the
Options Desk wanted a steeper USD ISDAFIX but already held a 10-year, 30-year
steepener position and thus had no hedging need for additional steepener positions
(“you'll need steeper but you already have the steepener”).
-----------------
The Swaps Desk trader
further confirmed with an Options Desk trader the amount available for trading (“‘let
me know how much you’ re willing to spend’’), and, upon learning the amount was
modest, noted the greater difficulty of trying to manipulate without being willing to
trade larger amounts (“it’s not much - will try to play some magic’’).
-----------------
The Options
Desk trader replied, “you can do it.” In execution of this plan, shortly before 11:00
a.m., BNPP Swaps Desk traders bought 30-year swap spreads through Swaps Broker.
-----------------
In October 2008, the Options Desk stood to benefit from a steeper 10-year, 30-year
11:00 a.m. USD ISDAFIX curve (1.e., a lower 10-year rate relative to a higher 30-
year point) because of the desk’s exotics positions.
-----------------
Before 11:00 a.m., Options Desk
traders discussed the desk’s approach to the upcoming 11:00 a.m. fixing, given the
desk’s significant existing exotics positions.
-----------------
One trader asked: “whats [sic] going on
with the 1 lam fix, and whats [sic] the desk strategy?” In response, another Options
Desk trader explained the amount and direction of anticipated trading in the 10-year,
30-year curve, as well as the purpose, namely, to accomplish a steeper 10-year, 30-
year curve at the 11:00 a.m. fixing: “SOOk of steepening to move the screen up.” To
execute this strategy for the benefit of the Options Desk’s positions, shortly before
11:00 a.m., the BNPP Swaps Desk submitted bids and offers and executed trades
through Swaps Broker in 10-year and 30-year tenors.
-----------------
In addition, shortly before
11:00 a.m. BNPP traders bought 10-year Treasuries and sold 30-year Treasuries.
-----------------
Combined, this trading put downward pressure on the 10-year USD ISDAFIX and
13
upward pressure on the 30-year USD ISDAFIX, and thus steepening pressure on the
10-year, 30-year USD ISDAFIX curve.
-----------------
e In February 2010, the Options Desk stood to benefit from a higher 5-year 11:00 a.m.
USD ISDAFIX in connection with the cash settlement of a 5-year swaption position
that it held with another dealer.
-----------------
To benefit this position, shortly before 11:00 a.m. a
BNPP Swaps Desk trader bought 5-year swap spreads that were brokered by Swaps
Broker, thus putting upward pressure on the 11:00 a.m. fixing in that tenor.
-----------------
In
addition, shortly before 11:00 a.m. BNPP traders sold 5-year Treasuries, thereby
putting upward pressure on the 5-year USD ISDAFIX.
-----------------
Shortly after 11:00 a.m., the
BNPP swaps desk also submitted a 5-year rate that was higher than the reference rate
disseminated by Swaps Broker in an attempt to manipulate USD ISDAFIX higher in
that maturity.

FINDINGS
The Commission finds the following:
A.
-----------------
SUMMARY
On numerous occasions throughout the Relevant Period, Respondent, by and through
certain of its traders (“Traders”) placed orders to buy or sell gold, silver, platinum, and palladium
(“Precious Metals”) futures contracts, traded on the Commodity Exchange, Inc. (““COMEX”),
with the intent to cancel the orders before execution.
-----------------
The Traders engaged in this conduct with
the intent to manipulate market prices and ultimately did cause artificial prices.
-----------------
By and through
the acts of these Traders, Respondent engaged in manipulation and attempted manipulation in
violation of Section 9(a)(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
-----------------
§ 13(a)(2) (2012), and, for conduct occurring on
or after August 15, 2011, spoofing in violation of Section 4c(a)(5)(C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.

6c(a)(5)(C) (2012), and manipulation and attempted manipulation in violation of Section 6(c)(1)

-----------------
§§ 180.1, 180.2 (2018).
-----------------
* * * * *
In accepting the Offer, the Commission recognizes Respondent’s significant cooperation
with the Division of Enforcement’s (“Division”) investigation of this matter, which is explained
in more detail below.
-----------------
The Commission notes that Respondent’s cooperation is reflected in the
form of a substantially reduced civil monetary penalty.
-----------------
B. RESPONDENT
Merrill Lynch Commodities, Inc. is a Delaware corporation engaged in, among other
things, the trading of commodities.
-----------------
The company is headquartered in Houston, Texas and
operates in various locations including New York, New York.
-----------------
The company is an indirectly
wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation (“BAC”).
-----------------
MLCI has been
provisionally registered with the Commission as a Swap Dealer since December 31, 2012.
-----------------
On FACTS
1.
-----------------
Spoofing, Manipulation, and Attempted Manipulation
During the Relevant Period, in connection with its Precious Metals business, MLCI and
affiliates employed the Traders and others at trading desks in the United States, the United
Kingdom, and elsewhere.
-----------------
As part of the Precious Metals business, the Traders on behalf of
MLCI, placed orders and entered into transactions for futures contracts in Precious Metals,
which were traded on COMEX, a futures exchange and designated contract market which is
owned and operated by CME Group, Inc. (“CME”), and options related to Precious Metals.
-----------------
On numerous occasions throughout the Relevant Period, the Traders manually placed
orders for futures contracts in Precious Metals with the intent to cancel those orders before
execution.
-----------------
The Traders’ spoofing strategy frequently involved placing a relatively small bid or
offer with the intent to execute that order (the “Genuine Order’) and, prior to the execution of the
Genuine Order, placing a larger order (or multiple orders) on the opposite side of the same
market with the intent to cancel the order or orders before execution (the “Spoof Order”).
-----------------
Generally, the Traders would receive a partial or complete fill of the Genuine Order and cancel
the Spoof Order before it was filled.
-----------------
On occasion, certain Traders acknowledged spoofing to affect prices of Precious Metals
futures contracts in electronic “chat” conversations.
-----------------
For example, in a November 16, 2010 chat
one of the Traders, Trader A, stated:
“suys the algos are really geared up in here.
-----------------
[I]f you spoof this it
really moves... .”
In another chat, on or about February 11, 2011, Trader A discussed spoofing again, offering to
help Trader B, a trader at an entity affiliated with MLCI:
Trader A: that was me pushing it
Trader A: dont do it yourself I will help you
Trader A: dont spoof it
Trader A: what did you get 70 lots there?
-----------------
Trader B: ok
Trader B: yep
Consistent with this chat, Trader A did, in fact, engage in spoofing in the market for silver
futures contracts.
-----------------
The Traders placed one or more Spoof Orders to create a false impression of buying or
selling interest in Precious Metals futures markets, with the intent to manipulate prices to reflect
their desired price and not the legitimate forces of supply and demand.
-----------------
Ultimately, the Traders
were successful, and they executed trades at their desired price.
-----------------
2.
-----------------
Cooperation and Remediation
During the course of the Division’s investigation of potential misconduct in the precious
metals market, Respondent expended significant time and resources to promptly provide
information to the Division, including a detailed data analysis, and identified relevant
documents, which allowed the Division to conserve resources and expedite its investigation.
-----------------
Further, Respondent has worked proactively to remediate the issues, and has represented that it
has significantly enhanced its compliance systems and policies related to spoofing and other
manipulative conduct in Precious Metals futures contracts, and futures contracts generally.
-----------------
il.
-----------------
LEGAL DISCUSSION
A. Spoofing in Precious Metals Futures Markets, in Violation of Section 4¢e(a)(5)(C) of
the Act
Section 4c(a)(5)(C) of the Act makes it unlawful for “[a]ny person to engage in any
trading, practice, or conduct on or subject to the rules of a registered entity that .
-----------------
.
-----------------
.
-----------------
is, is of the
character of, or is commonly known to the trade as, ‘spoofing’ (bidding or offering with the
intent to cancel the bid or offer before execution).” 7 U.S.C.
-----------------
§ 6c(a)(5)(C) (2012).
-----------------
As described above, on numerous occasions during the Relevant Period, the Traders
entered bids or offers on a registered entity with the intent to cancel the bids or offers before
execution, in violation of Section 4c(a)(5)(C) of the Act.
-----------------
See, e.g., CFTC v. Oystacher, 203 F.
Supp.
-----------------
3d 934, 942 (N.D. Ill. 2016) (denying motion for judgment on the pleadings, holding that
allegations of placing “both bids and offers with the intent to cancel those bids or offers before
execution” constitutes “trading behavior [that] falls within the Spoofing Statute’s defined
prohibition”).

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“Commission”) has reason to believe that
from December 31, 2012, until at least 2018 (the “Relevant Period”), The Bank of New York

FINDINGS
The Commission finds the following:
A.
-----------------
SUMMARY
Over a period of more than five years, from December 31, 2012, through at least 2018,
BNYM failed to correctly report hundreds of thousands of swap transactions to an SDR as
required by the Act and the Regulations.
-----------------
This conduct violated Sections 2(a)(13)(G) and 4r(a)(3)
of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
-----------------
§§ 2(a)(13)(G), 6r(a)(3) (2012), and Regulations 43.3 and 45.3, 17 C.F.R.
-----------------
§§ 43.3, 45.3 (2019).
-----------------
In accepting Respondent’s Offer of Settlement, the Commission recognizes BNYM’s
substantial cooperation during the Division of Enforcement’s (“Division”) investigation of this
matter.
-----------------
The Commission notes that BNYM’s cooperation and remediation are recognized in the
form of a substantially reduced civil monetary penalty.
-----------------
B. RESPONDENT
The Bank of New York Mellon (““BNYM”) is the world’s largest custody bank and asset
servicing company.
-----------------
BNYM became a provisionally registered swap dealer on December 31,
2012.
-----------------
Its swap dealer activity is centered in its Markets Group which offers products including |
Spot Foreign Exchange (“FX”), Deliverable FX Swaps and Forwards, and Interest Rate Swaps.
-----------------
C. FACTS
1.","FX Swap Reporting Violations
From December 31, 2012, through July 2, 2018, BNYM failed to correctly report tens of
thousands of FX swaps.
-----------------
FX swaps do not have a unique product identifier so each leg of the FX
swap needs to be reported to the SDR along with an identifier linking the legs.
-----------------
During this
period, BNYM did not correctly report approximately one-third of its FX swaps.
-----------------
For some of
these incorrectly reported FX swaps, BNYM reported only one leg of the swap.
-----------------
For others,
BNYM reported both legs of the swap transaction, but failed to include the identifier indicating
that these two legs were in fact a single swap transaction.
-----------------
Both types of errors had the effect of
making it impossible for a person contemporaneously reviewing BNYM’s reports to determine
that BNYM had, in fact, entered into these 184,000 FX swap transactions.
-----------------
2.
-----------------
Interaffiliate Swap Reporting Violations
From early 2013 through March 2016, nine BNYM affiliates were incorrectly classified
as intrabank accounts rather than separate legal entities.
-----------------
As a result, tens of thousands of
transactions with these nine affiliates that should have been reported to an SDR were not
reported.
-----------------
3.
-----------------
Swap Reporting Violations Involving Bunched Trades
Throughout the Relevant Period, BNYM has entered into FX transactions with
investment managers acting as agents for one or more principals (“Bunched Trades”).
-----------------
After a
Bunched Trade was executed, the investment manager provided BNYM with the names of the
customers to which portions of the Bunched Trades were to be booked and the size of each such
portion (“Allocated Trades”).
-----------------
Since December 31, 2012, through at least December 31, 2018,
BNYM has been reporting these Allocated Trades but failing to report the underlying Bunched
Trades.
-----------------
During the Relevant Period, thousands of Bunched Trades that should have been
reported to an SDR were not reported.
-----------------
4, BNYM’s Cooperation
Throughout the Division’s investigation, BNYM provided substantial cooperation.
-----------------
Among other things, BNYM conducted an internal investigation and provided specific and
detailed information to the Division regarding the reporting deficiencies its internal investigation
revealed.
-----------------
BNYM continued to substantially cooperate with the Division in its effort to confirm
the results of the internal investigation.
-----------------
In addition, BNYM has taken substantial steps to
remediate these deficiencies and improve its processes for swap reporting going forward.
-----------------
Il.
-----------------
LEGAL DISCUSSION
A. BNYM?’s Conduct Violated Sections 2(a)(13)(G) and 4r(a)(3) of the Act,
7 U.S.C, 8§ 2(a)(13)(G), 6r(a)(3) (2012), and Regulations 43.3 and 45.3,

8§ 43.3, 45.3 (2019)
Sections 2(a)(13)(G) and 4r(a)(3) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
-----------------
§§ 2(a)(13)(G), 6r(a)(3) (2012),
require that swaps be reported to an SDR and establishes requirements for such reporting.

section of the Act and the Commission’s implementing regulations in Parts 43 and 45 of the
Regulations, 17 C.F.R.
-----------------
pts.
-----------------
43, 45 (2019), were designed to enhance transparency, promote
standardization, and reduce systemic risk.
-----------------
The accuracy and completeness of swap reporting are
critical to the Commission’s mission to protect market participants and to ensure market
integrity.

-----------------
15-11, 2015 WL 1508451 (Dec. 22,
2014) (consent order).
-----------------
Among the requirements of the Act and Regulations related to swap reporting, Part 43
establishes requirements for the real-time reporting and public availability of swap transaction
data.
-----------------
See Regulations 43.2 and 43.3, 17 C.F.R.
-----------------
§§ 43.2, 43.3 (2019).
-----------------
Under Part 43, reporting
parties must report a publicly-reportable swap transaction to an SDR as soon as technologically
practicable after the swap transaction is executed.
-----------------
See Regulation 43.3.
-----------------
Part 45 of the Regulations requires reporting parties to, among other things, report swap
creation data to an SDR.
-----------------
Regulation 45.3, 17 C.F.R.
-----------------
§ 45.3 (2019), sets forth the requirements
for reporting creation data, including primary economic terms data and confirmation data.
-----------------
See
Regulation 45.3(b) and 45.3(c).
-----------------
From December 31, 2012, through 2018, on thousands of occasions, BNYM failed to
report swap transactions to an SDR consistent with the requirements of Sections 2(a)(13)(G) and
4r(a)(3) of the Act and Regulations 43.3 and 45.3.
-----------------
Accordingly, BNYM violated these
provisions of the Act and the Regulations.
-----------------
B. BNYM’s Liability for the Acts of Its Employees
Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
-----------------
§ 2(a)(1)(B) (2012), and Regulation 1.2, 17
C.F.R.
-----------------
§ 1.2 (2019), provide that the act, omission, or failure of any official, agent, or other
person acting for any individual, association, partnership, corporation, or trust within the scope
of his employment or office shall be deemed the act, omission, or failure of such individual,
association, partnership, corporation, or trust.
-----------------
Pursuant to Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act and
Regulation 1.2, strict liability is imposed on principals for the actions of their agents.
-----------------
See, e.g.,
Dohmen-Ramirez & Wellington Advisory, Inc. v. CFTC, 837 F.2d 847, 857-58 (9th Cir.
-----------------
1988);
Rosenthal & Co. v. CFTC, 802 F.2d 963, 966 (7th Cir.
-----------------
1986).
-----------------
The foregoing acts, omissions, and failures of BNYM’s employees occurred within the
scope of their employment, office, or agency with BNYM; therefore, pursuant to Section
2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, and Regulation 1.2, BNYM is liable for those acts, omissions, and failures
in violation of the Act and Regulations.

-----------------
II.","FINDINGS
The Commission finds the following:
A.
-----------------
SUMMARY
From June 2014 through November 2018 (the “Relevant Period’), Interactive Brokers
failed to diligently supervise its employees’ handling of several commodity trading accounts held
at Interactive Brokers that were the subject of recent enforcement actions and nonpublic
investigations initiated by the Commission.
-----------------
The account holders involved in those matters
include Haena Park (“‘Park’’), Nathan Schleifer (‘Schleifer’), and Hyun Joo (a/k/a Grace) Hong
(“Grace Hong’), along with two additional individuals (‘Customer A” and “Customer B’’)
against whom the Commission has not filed charges to date.
-----------------
Interactive Brokers’ failure to
provide sufficient oversight of its employees’ handling of these accounts contributed to its failure
to maintain an adequate anti-money laundering (“AML”) program and to conduct appropriate
customer monitoring.
-----------------
As a result, Interactive Brokers employees failed to identify or adequately
investigate certain indicia of suspicious activity in the accounts at issue that, according to
Interactive Brokers’ own compliance procedures and given its knowledge of each customer’s
background and trading patterns, should have prompted the filing of Suspicious Activity Reports
(“SARs”) with appropriate authorities.
-----------------
In each matter, Interactive Brokers failed to file a SAR
when it had a duty to do so.
-----------------
In three of the underlying matters, unbeknownst to Interactive Brokers, the account
holders used their accounts at Interactive Brokers to defraud investors of millions of dollars.
-----------------
Moreover, in several of the matters, Interactive Brokers learned, through responding to a
subpoena or other request from a government authority, that the account holder was under
investigation by a regulator or law enforcement agency but did not adequately conduct its own
investigation to determine whether to file a SAR.
-----------------
As these failures reflect, Interactive Brokers lacked a reasonably designed process for
conducting investigations of account activity and making SAR determinations.
-----------------
Interactive
Brokers also failed to ensure that its officers, employees, and agents followed its established
policies and procedures with respect to customer surveillance.
-----------------
By virtue of this conduct,
Interactive Brokers engaged in acts and practices that violated Regulations 42.2 and 166.3, 17
C.F.R.
-----------------
§§ 42.2, 166.3 (2019).
-----------------
B. RESPONDENT
Interactive Brokers LLC is registered with the Commission as an FCM that maintains its
principal place of business at One Pickwick Plaza, Greenwich, Connecticut 06830.
-----------------
Interactive
Brokers has been registered with the Commission since December 2, 1994.
-----------------
Interactive Brokers
is also a Forex Dealer Member of the National Futures Association (“NFA”).

-----------------
FINDINGS
The Commission finds the following:
A.
-----------------
Summary
Vitol is a significant participant in the globally interconnected physical and derivatives
markets for oil, with a substantial trading operation based in Houston, Texas.
-----------------
At various times
from 2005 through early 2020, Vitol engaged in conduct designed to increase profits from
physical and derivatives trading in the global oil markets through corruption, fraud, and at times
during August 2014 and July 2015, manipulation.
-----------------
Vitol’s conduct during the Relevant Period involved corrupt payments (e.g., bribes and
kickbacks) to employees and agents of certain state-owned entities (“SOEs”) in Brazil, Ecuador,
and Mexico.
-----------------
Vitol or its affiliates made the corrupt payments in exchange for improper
preferential treatment and access to trades with the SOEs.
-----------------
Regarding Brazil, the corrupt
payments also were in exchange for nonpublic information from employees and agents of the
SOE, including information material to Vitol’s transactions with the SOE or related trading.
-----------------
Vitol’s conduct was intended to secure unlawful competitive advantages in trading physical oil
products and related derivatives to the detriment of its counterparties and market participants.
-----------------
Regarding the Brazil scheme, from approximately 2005 until 2015, in exchange for
corrupt payments to employees and agents of the Brazilian SOE (“SOE agents”), Vitol obtained,
in addition to improper preferential treatment and access to trades, confidential information
concerning the SOE’s projected supply, demand, and strategic planning related to oil products
markets around the world, including U.S. markets.
-----------------
At times, the confidential information Vitol
obtained included the exact nonpublic price—at times referred to internally at Vitol as the “gold
number’’—at which Vitol understood it would win a supposedly competitive bidding or tender
process.
-----------------
Vitol used the corruptly obtained confidential information to deceive the SOE and other
market participants.
-----------------
Vitol traders, while in possession of this improperly obtained information,
traded and secured physical oil products and related derivative contracts in a broad range of oil
markets in the United States and globally.
-----------------
At times, Vitol used improperly obtained confidential
information from the SOE to secure facially legitimate Exchange of Futures for Physical
transactions (“EFPs”) on the U.S. derivatives markets, whereby Vitol exchanged futures
positions for physical oil with that SOE.
-----------------
Regarding the Ecuador and Mexico schemes, between in or about 2015 and in or about
2020, Vitol via intermediaries made corrupt payments to SOE agents in Ecuador and in Mexico
in exchange for improper preferential treatment and access to trades with the relevant SOEs.
-----------------
In addition, at times during August 2014 and July 2015, Vitol also attempted to
manipulate certain U.S. price assessment benchmarks relating to physical fuel oil products in
order to benefit its related physical and derivatives positions.
-----------------
Vitol’s manipulative and deceptive conduct undermined the legitimate forces of supply
and demand and the integrity of the global physical and derivatives oil markets.
-----------------
In accepting Respondent’s Offer, the Commission recognizes the substantial cooperation
of Vitol with the Division of Enforcement’s (“Division’’) investigation of this matter.
-----------------
The
Commission also acknowledges Respondent’s representations concerning its remediation in
connection with this matter.
-----------------
The Commission’s recognition of Respondent’s substantial
cooperation and appropriate remediation is further reflected in the form of a reduced penalty.
-----------------
B. Respondent
Vitol Inc. is one of the companies doing business together as the Vitol Group, a
sophisticated, multinational energy and commodities trading firm that is a global trader of oil and
oil products.
-----------------
The affiliates comprising Vitol Group include, among others, Vitol S.A.,
headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland; Vitol Inc. and Vitol Capital Management Ltd., based in
Houston, Texas; and Vitol do Brasil Ltda., based in Brazil.
-----------------
Vitol Group is the world’s largest
privately owned physical oil and gas trading firm.
-----------------
Vitol Inc. maintains a substantial trading
operation based in Houston, Texas.
-----------------
During the Relevant Period and the Charging Period, Vitol
Inc. actively traded physical and derivative oil products across major trading hubs in the United
States, the Americas, and beyond.
-----------------
Neither Vitol Inc. nor any of its affiliates has ever been
registered with the Commission.
-----------------
Cc.
-----------------
Facts
1.
-----------------
Market Background
The global oil markets include physical commodity flows among oil producers, refiners,
shipping and storage facilities, and consumers.
-----------------
Numerous oil products are traded in these
markets, including crude oil, distilled and refined products, and oil byproducts blended to various
specifications that are used for a variety of purposes.
-----------------
These varied oil products flow across
geographic regions before reaching distributors and end-user consumers.
-----------------
The United States is a
world leader in the global markets for physical oil.
-----------------
Major trading hubs in the United States
include, among others, the U.S. Atlantic Coast and the U.S. Gulf Coast.
-----------------
The physical flows of oil products around the world are linked in various physical and
derivatives markets.
-----------------
Market participants use the derivatives markets, which include among other
things futures, options, and swaps, to manage physical price exposures and to speculate on price
trends.
-----------------
The United States is a world leader in the derivatives markets as well; U.S.-based
exchanges have many derivatives products tied to the prices of oil products.
-----------------
S&P Global Platts (“Platts”) is a London-based price reporting agency that has offices in
several countries, including the United States.
-----------------
Platts provides benchmark prices for a variety of
energy-related products and markets throughout the world, including oil products.
-----------------
Benchmarks
provided by Platts (as well as benchmarks provided by other price reporting agencies) are often
used by market participants as a price reference for physical contracts.
-----------------
These contracts are
generally set at an agreed-upon benchmark value, plus or minus a negotiated dollar differential
that may reflect the quality of the product or other aspects of the trade.
-----------------
With relevance here, the Platts New York Harbor No.
-----------------
6 1% Fuel Oil benchmark and the
Platts U.S. Gulf Coast High Sulfur Fuel Oil benchmark are both assessed from Platts’ offices in
Houston, Texas.
-----------------
Both benchmarks are assessed by Platts using the “market-on-close” (MOC)
methodology.
-----------------
The MOC methodology takes into account trading activity and market
information that is reported throughout the day by market participants, as well as the trading
activity that occurs during a 30 or 45 minute period of time each day (“trading window’’) through
Platts’ online tool known as the Editorial Window (“eWindow”).” During the trading window,
approved market participants may submit, bids, offers, or intents to trade in the eWindow based
on a set of rules established by Platts.
-----------------
At the close of the trading window, Platts considers
activity in the eWindow and other information it has gathered in order to assess the benchmark
for the day.
-----------------
Generally, physical oil prices, oil derivatives prices, and oil benchmark prices are
interrelated.
-----------------
Derivative products such as futures and swaps allow market participants to hedge
physical transactions and otherwise manage price risks, conduct price discovery, and
complement their physical trading activities.
-----------------
Benchmarks may serve as references both to
physical trades, and to futures contracts and swaps that price in reference to the benchmarks.
-----------------
Those futures contracts trade on exchanges based in the United States, like the New York
Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”), a Designated Contract Market (“DCM”) owned by CME
Group, Inc. (“CME”) and are cleared on registered Derivatives Clearing Organizations
(“DCOs’”’), such as ICE Clear Europe Ltd.
-----------------
Similarly, swaps include those cleared through DCOs
in the United States, as well as those not centrally cleared, but rather reported to the Commission
through swap data repositories.
-----------------
At times, market participants such as Vitol use futures contracts
to engage in EFPs, in which a futures position is traded for a physical commodity, and then the
futures position is submitted for clearing by a DCO.
-----------------
2.
-----------------
Vitol’s Fraudulent and Manipulative Conduct
a.
-----------------
Fraud Using Corrupt Practices
At various times during the Relevant Period and the Charging Period, Vitol, by and
through its traders and agents, made corrupt payments to employees and agents working at SOEs
of Brazil, Ecuador, and Mexico.
-----------------
Vitol or its affiliates made the corrupt payments in exchange
for improper preferential treatment and access to trades with the SOEs.
-----------------
Regarding Brazil, the
corrupt payments also were in exchange for nonpublic information from employees and agents
of the SOE, including information material to Vitol’s transactions with the SOE or related
trading.
-----------------
Vitol’s conduct was designed to increase Vitol’s profits from certain physical and
derivatives trading in oil markets around the world.
-----------------
To conceal the corruption, the corrupt payments were made through offshore bank
accounts or to shell entities.
-----------------
In some instances, corrupt payments also were invoiced through a
putative third-party company, which issued deceptive invoices to Vitol for euphemistic services
such as “market intelligence” or “sell support.”
With respect to Vitol’s corruption scheme in Brazil, SOE agents who had access to
confidential information—and who owed a duty to the SOE under law and applicable
 
2 The length of time for the trading window (30 or 45 minutes) has changed over time during the Relevant Period,
and may also vary by product.
-----------------
Prior to the introduction of the eWindow, Platts collected bids, offers, and intents to
trade during the trading window via phone, instant message, email and/or fax.
-----------------
employment policies to keep the information confidential—disclosed nonpublic information,
including information material to Vitol’s transactions with the SOE or related trading, to Vitol in
exchange for corrupt payments.
-----------------
Vitol traders in knowing possession of the confidential
information then entered into physical transactions and related futures transactions.
-----------------
From
approximately 2005 until 2015, a supervisor at Vitol affiliate Vitol do Brasil Ltda (the “Vitol
Brazil supervisor”), overseen by Vitol supervisors in Houston, made corrupt payments to four
SOE agents at the SOE, all of whom were required under company ethics and employment
requirements, as well as legal requirements, to maintain the confidentiality of the information.
-----------------
In
breach of such duties, and in exchange for substantial corrupt payments, these SOE agents
routinely disclosed confidential information to the Vitol Brazil supervisor, who then
disseminated it to Vitol traders in Houston.
-----------------
The corrupt payments Vitol paid to SOE agents,
along with intermediaries who facilitated the corrupt payments, amounted to approximately $3
million.
-----------------
A Vitol supervisor and personnel in Houston knew of, oversaw, and approved such
corrupt payments.
-----------------
Vitol used these corrupt payments to, among other things, rig or circumvent bidding
processes for oil contracts to the detriment of the SOE and market participants involved in the
bidding processes.
-----------------
For example, the confidential information obtained through corruption
included the specific nonpublic price—referred to internally at Vitol as the “gold number’”—at
which Vitol understood it would win a supposedly competitive bidding or tender processes.
-----------------
By
receiving a “last look,” Vitol was given the opportunity to meet or beat the best price offered to
the SOE, including the preferential treatment of winning the trade in the event of a tie.
-----------------
In one instance in early 2013, Houston-based Vitol oil traders communicated about a
particular trade opportunity with the Vitol Brazil supervisor who had obtained confidential
information from SOE agents through corrupt payments.
-----------------
The Vitol Brazil supervisor informed
the traders regarding the exact, nonpublic price at which they could win the trade, explaining:
Vitol Brazil supervisor [A competitor] is offering [a particular price].
-----------------
This is the gold number.
-----------------
Let [me] know ....
Houston trader So if we go to [the gold number price]
they will give it to us?
-----------------
Vitol Brazil supervisor Yes.
-----------------
This is the gold number.
-----------------
Houston trader Okay great... we'll take it.
-----------------
The Vitol trader in Houston then entered into the trade for 275,000 barrels of high sulfur
diesel with the SOE’s subsidiary in the United States.
-----------------
The trade was priced in reference to a
U.S. price benchmark for oil.
-----------------
This variety of information provided Vitol traders and supervisors
in Houston, as well as others at Vitol Group, an improper asymmetric information advantage
over their counterparties and other market participants.’ Other categories of confidential
 
3 Apart from confidential information itself, Vitol also obtained improper preferential treatment through bribery.
-----------------
For example, in early 2013, a Vitol trader bid the exact same price as a competitor to purchase a 300,000 barrel high
sulfur diesel cargo from the SOE, worth more than $30 million.
-----------------
The Vitol trader obtained the trade, even though the
bids were identical.
-----------------
As a result, the SOE was deprived of a potentially more-competitive bid for the cargo, and the
information obtained through corrupt payments included details of the SOE’s forecasted supply
and demand, as well as historical import/export data.
-----------------
Once the confidential information was
obtained through corrupt payments, it typically was disseminated to Vitol traders in the United
States and elsewhere to be used in connection with trading activity in the physical and derivative
oil markets, among other things.
-----------------
At times, Vitol and/or its affiliates used improperly obtained confidential information
from the SOE to secure a facially legitimate EFP on the U.S. derivatives markets, whereby Vitol
exchanged futures positions for physical oil with that SOE.
-----------------
* Also at times, Vitol, while in
possession of the confidential information, would assume a derivatives position in advance of the
SOE obtaining its physical position.
-----------------
Vitol documents and communications reveal that Vitol supervisors and traders
understood the sensitivity of improperly obtained confidential information, and took steps to
maintain it in confidence and ensure that the SOE would not learn they had it in their possession.
-----------------
To that end, the communications disseminating the improperly obtained confidential information
within Vitol were labeled “private and confidential” or “pnc” for short.
-----------------
Vitol traders appreciated
the sensitivity of this information, and considered it material to certain of Vitol’s business and
trading decisions.°
Regarding the Ecuador and Mexico schemes, between in or about 2015 and in or about
2020, Vitol via intermediaries made corrupt payments to SOE agents in Ecuador and in Mexico
in exchange for improper preferential treatment and access to trades with the relevant SOEs.
-----------------
b. Vitol Attempted to Manipulate U.S Physical Fuel Oil Pricing
Benchmarks to Benefit Physical and Derivatives Positions
On certain occasions during August 2014 and July 2015, Vitol attempted to manipulate
Platts benchmarks related to physical fuel oil in order to benefit Vitol’s related physical and
derivatives positions, including those obtained while in possession of the SOE’s nonpublic
information.
-----------------
As mentioned above, the price of Vitol’s physical oil contracts with counterparties,
including SOEs, was often determined in reference to Platts benchmarks.
-----------------
If the price of the
 
market was deprived of a fair bidding process.
-----------------
In connection with this specific cargo trade, which Vitol was
awarded despite not outbidding a competitor, Vitol made corrupt payments exceeding $20,000 to an SOE agent.
-----------------
4 CME rules provide that “EFRPs [including EFPs] may be transacted at such commercially reasonable prices as are
mutually agreed upon by the parties to the transaction.
-----------------
EFRPs may not be priced to facilitate the transfer of funds
between parties for any purpose other than as the consequence of legitimate commercial activity.” Exchange for
Related Positions, CME Rulebook Rule 538.F (Jan. 2, 2020).
-----------------
> In October 2015, for example, the Vitol Brazil supervisor sent confidential information concerning the SOE’s
import and export program to Vitol and Vitol affiliates traders and supervisors in London, Houston, and Asia.
-----------------
The
transmittal email prefaced the confidential information with “<PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL_PLEASE>,”
denoting that it was obtained from SOE agents.
-----------------
In response, one Vitol trader replied to the email: “Thanks [Vitol
Brazil supervisor] - very useful and will be kept private.” The trader then requested additional confidential SOE
information, which the Vitol Brazil supervisor provided soon thereafter.
-----------------
relevant Platts benchmark increased or decreased during the time period in which a physical deal
priced, Vitol stood to make or lose profits on benchmark exposure from those physical oil deals
(to the extent the exposure was not hedged).
-----------------
Vitol’s violative trading activity occurred in the Platts New York Harbor No.
-----------------
6 1% Fuel
Oil benchmark and the Platts U.S. Gulf Coast High Sulfur Fuel Oil benchmark trading windows,
and included submitting bids, offers, and intents to trade in order to benefit Vitol’s related
physical and/or derivatives positions such as futures and swaps.
-----------------
Numerous futures contracts on
U.S. exchanges were settled in reference to these physical fuel oil benchmarks’ respective daily
assessments, aS were certain swaps.
-----------------
First, in August 2014, Vitol had physical and derivatives positions that together generated
daily net short exposures of varying sizes for Vitol to the Platts New York Harbor No.
-----------------
6.1% Fuel
Oil benchmark.
-----------------
Part of Vitol’s short exposures to the benchmark in August 2014 arose from two
transactions with a Brazilian SOE in which Vitol agreed to buy an aggregate amount of
approximately 500,000 barrels of low sulfur fuel oil from the SOE, transactions made while in
possession of improperly obtained confidential information.
-----------------
Both deals were priced in reference
to the Platts New York Harbor No.
-----------------
6 1% Fuel Oil benchmark.
-----------------
Vitol did not hedge its daily exposure to the Platts benchmark during August 2014
through derivatives trades.
-----------------
Instead, Vitol traders’ positions in derivatives, such as futures
contracts traded in U.S. futures markets, amplified Vitol’s exposure to the relevant benchmark.
-----------------
And then, on numerous days in August 2014, Vitol engaged in trading activity at prices and in a
manner intended to influence the benchmark downward in order to benefit its related positions.
-----------------
Second, in July 2015, Vitol had significant exposure to the Platts U.S. Gulf Coast High
Sulfur Fuel Oil benchmark.
-----------------
Using U.S. derivatives, Vitol entered into a futures “calendar
spread,” in which it had long daily exposures in July and short daily exposures in August to that
benchmark.
-----------------
As a result of these positions, Vitol would benefit from a wider spread between the
benchmark pricing in the two months, meaning it would have increased profits if the average
benchmark price in July rose (or fell less) relative to the average benchmark price in August.
-----------------
In other months around this time, Vitol submitted both bids and offers in that eWindow—
that is, Vitol was consistently on both sides of the market.
-----------------
But in July 2015, with only one
exception, Vitol was active only on the buy side of the market.
-----------------
In particular, virtually every day
that month Vitol submitted bids and purchased cargos in the trading window, in a manner and at
prices intended to influence upward the level of the daily benchmark price, thereby intending to
increase the July-August spread.
-----------------
Vitol did so with the intent to benefit its related derivatives
positions.
-----------------
By attempting to manipulate such benchmarks, Vitol was also attempting to manipulate
and would have distorted numerous futures, swaps, and other derivatives and physical trades that
price in reference to those benchmarks.
-----------------
This would be to the detriment of market participants
that had opposite exposure (including Vitol’s counterparties), or who looked to rely on the
benchmarks as a fair price reference for physical or derivative trades, including U.S. futures
contracts and swaps.
-----------------
3.
-----------------
Cooperation
Vitol voluntarily provided material information to the Division obtained by Vitol through
an internal investigation it conducted.
-----------------
Vitol proactively identified information of interest,
produced expeditious and prioritized responses to the Division Staff’s requests for information
on a voluntary basis, and assisted the Division in analyzing trading data.
-----------------
Vitol also commenced significant remedial action to improve internal controls and
policies related to the use of third-party agents and payments to third parties, as well as related to
eWindow trading.
-----------------
In particular, Vitol represents that Vitol and its affiliates have strengthened
due diligence and approval processes related to the use of third parties, updated relevant model
agreements, and initiated a global review of payment processes.
-----------------
Vitol further represents that
Vitol has also dedicated additional resources to the compliance function and enhanced its
internal trading surveillance processes, including with respect to trading activity in oil liquids
MOCs.

THE COURT HEREBY FINDS:
A.","Findings of Fact
The Parties to this Consent Order
15.
-----------------
— Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an independent federal
regulatory agency that is charged by Congress with administering and enforcing the Act and the
Regulations.
-----------------
16.
-----------------
Defendant Douglas Lien is 79 years old, resides in Santa Fe, New Mexico and has
never been registered with the Commission in any capacity.
-----------------
Lien’s Long-Running Fraud
17.
-----------------
Lien maintains a futures trading account in his own name at a futures commission
merchant (“FCM A”) registered with the CFTC.
-----------------
Lien originally opened his trading account at a
different registered FCM (“FCM B”) in 2001, and Lien’s original account opening paperwork

includes a November 25, 2001, letter to FCM B signed by Lien that states, “this is to confirm
that all the funds in my account are my own and will be traded only at my discretion.” Lien’s
account was ultimately acquired by FCM A in 2012, and his personal trading account has
remained open there since.
-----------------
18.
-----------------
Starting in at least August 2000, Lien solicited and accepted funds from friends
and acquaintances for the purpose of trading their funds in commodity futures contracts,
primarily U.S. Treasury bond futures.
-----------------
19.
-----------------
Lien did not disclose to clients or prospective clients that he was not registered
with the CFTC as an FCM or any other capacity.
-----------------
20.
-----------------
Lien typically entered into an account agreement with each new client on
letterhead stating “Douglas Lien” or “Douglas Lien / westend investments.” A typical agreement
stated that the client’s funds would be traded, that Lien would reinvest monthly income by
adding it to client equity, and that Lien’s fee would be 15% of net trading profits each month,
calculated as gross trading profits minus broker commissions.
-----------------
No provision in the agreement
gave Lien the right to receive any other fees or funds from the client’s account.
-----------------
21.
-----------------
Until approximately 2010 or 2011, Lien instructed clients to wire funds to a bank
account in the name of “Douglas Lien / westend investments” at a bank in Santa Fe, New
Mexico.
-----------------
After that, and during the Relevant Period, Lien instructed clients to wire funds to an
account in Lien’s name at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
-----------------
ending in 8968.
-----------------
22.
-----------------
Lien socialized with his clients over the years, even inviting some of his clients to
vacation with him and his wife on a private family-owned island near Martha’s Vineyard, and
many of Lien’s clients viewed him as a friend.
-----------------
Case 1:29-cv-O1153-WESCY DBocumentS9 Filed O4/O7/21 Page 6 of 19
23.
-----------------
For years, including during the Relevant Period, Lien led his clients to believe
that he profitably traded their funds, including by issuing clients periodic account statements and
annual tax forms showing profits.
-----------------
24.
-----------------
Lien typically emailed or hand delivered to his clients account statements on a
monthly or quarterly basis.
-----------------
Client account statements were usually sent as Word documents on
letterhead stating “Douglas Lien.” The statements were individualized and reflected account
balances, profits, deposits or withdrawals, Lien’s 15% management fees, and sometimes
corrections or adjustments to prior statements.
-----------------
Lien typically included market commentary in his
statements, and he sometimes added personal notes to clients about health, family, vacation
plans, and other topics.
-----------------
25.
-----------------
Lien also emailed or hand delivered to his clients annual tax forms, primarily
handwritten Form 1099s, showing profits of as much as hundreds of thousands of dollars.
-----------------
The
tax forms typically listed as the payer name “Douglas H. Lien,” and some of them included as a
descriptor “Regulated Futures Contracts.” As with the periodic account statements, each tax
form was individualized, reporting only a single client’s profits.
-----------------
26.
-----------------
For example, in March 2016, Lien emailed Client A an account statement for the
month of January 2016.
-----------------
The statement reported a month-end account balance of $2,502,609,
monthly “Trade/Investment” profits of $22,797, and Lien’s 15% management fee on those
profits, totaling $3,552.
-----------------
Lien’s commentary in the statement included a congratulatory statement
to Client A for exceeding a $2.5 million balance: “You finally made it.
-----------------
(I think I should have a
silver — not Gold — pin made for you that signifies that you are now a member of a very select
club.
-----------------
).” The following year, Lien emailed Client A a handwritten Form 1099 that reported his
2016 profit as $235,615 and included the description “Regulated Futures Contracts.”

-----------------
Lien accepted $14,275,632 in funds from clients from August 17, 2000 to the
present and he also reported more than $1.7 million in profits on tax forms he issued to clients
during the period from 2014 to 2018.
-----------------
28.
-----------------
However, the account statements and tax forms that Lien sent his clients did not
reflect Lien’s actual futures trading results, but instead showed fake trading profits and
management fees that Lien charged on those fake profits.
-----------------
29.
-----------------
Lien maintained a trading account balance of approximately $25,000 from at least
January 31, 2013, shortly after FCM A acquired Lien’s account, until March 2019.
-----------------
During the
Relevant Period, Lien made no deposits into his trading account and placed only three trades:
two trades in U.S. Treasury bond futures in 2017 and one trade in mini-corn futures in 2019,
resulting in a combined net loss of approximately $200.
-----------------
In March 2019, Lien withdrew $23,000
of his account balance with instructions to wire the funds to a bank account in his name at
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
-----------------
ending in 8968.
-----------------
Lien’s current account balance at FCM A is
approximately $1,880.
-----------------
30.
-----------------
From at least January 31, 2013 to the present, Lien maintained no other futures
trading accounts in his name at FCM A or any other FCM registered with the CFTC, nor did he
maintain any futures trading accounts in the name of “Westend Investments” at any FCM
registered with the CFTC.
-----------------
31.
-----------------
Throughout 2019, several of Lien’s clients requested the return of all or a portion
of their funds.
-----------------
While Lien has returned some of the funds requested, he failed to disclose to
clients that on multiple occasions, he paid clients using funds he received from other clients, in
the manner of a Ponzi scheme, or using funds he obtained from equity lines of credit, and not
Case 1:19-cv-O1153-WESCY DBocurnent SS Filed O4/07/21 Pace 6 of 18
using funds from clients’ own account balances or trading profits.
-----------------
He has otherwise strung
clients along with false excuses or simply ignored them.
-----------------
32.
-----------------
For example, in 2019, Clients A and B requested funds from their accounts.
-----------------
Lien
paid them a portion of the funds they requested in April 2019 using funds obtained from another
client, in the manner of a Ponzi scheme, without disclosing the source of those funds.
-----------------
As of mid-
June, Clients A and B had still not received the remainder of the funds they had requested.
-----------------
At
various points, including on approximately April 24, May 25, and June 18, 2019, Lien sent
Client A emails in which he blamed his delay in returning their funds in part on a change in
brokers, claiming that his old broker had left for another brokerage job and that his new broker
did not understand instructions delivered over the phone.
-----------------
These representations were false.
-----------------
No
FCM A broker managed funds for Lien or his clients from at least 2018 through the present.
-----------------
33.
-----------------
Lien also told at least one of his clients that, prior to having heart surgery in
August 2018, he placed client funds under management with an FCM A broker, who had placed
the funds in long-term investments that Lien could not access without incurring penalties.
-----------------
These
representations also were false.
-----------------
Neither Lien’s nor his clients’ funds are, or were, locked up in
long-term investments at FCM A.
-----------------
34.
-----------------
From August 17, 2000 to the present, Lien misappropriated $5,195,679 in client
funds, including client funds he used to pay other clients and “management fees” that he charged
based on fake trading profits.
-----------------
Of that sum, Lien kept $3,517,373 for himself as these
management fees.
