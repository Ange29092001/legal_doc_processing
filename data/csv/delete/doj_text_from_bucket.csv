THE GRAND JURY CHARGES:

At all times relevant to this Superseding Indictment, unless otherwise stated:
Ii The Defendants and Relevant Individuals and Entities

1. The defendant DONVILLE INNISS, a United States lawful permanent
resident who resided in Tampa, Florida, and Barbados, was a member of the Parliament of
Barbados and the Minister of Industry, International Business, Commerce, and Small Business
Development of Barbados (collectively, âMinister of Industryâ). INNISS was a public official
in Barbados and a âforeign officialâ as that term is used in the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
(âFCPAâ), Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2(h)(2)(A).

2. Insurance Corporation of Barbados Ltd. (âICBLââ) was an insurance
company headquartered in Barbados that offered various financial products, including individual
life, health and casualty insurance.

3s The defendant INGRID INNES was a citizen of Canada and a resident of

Barbados. INNES was the Chief Executive Officer (âCEOâ) of ICBL.
4. The defendant ALEX TASKER was a citizen and resident of Barbados.
TASKER was a senior vice president of ICBL.

5; ICBL Executive 1, an individual whose identity is known to the Grand
Jury, was a citizen and resident of Barbados. ICBL Executive 1 was the Chief Financial Officer
of ICBL.

6. The âBermuda Company,â a corporation the identity of which is known to
the Grand Jury, was an insurance company headquartered in Bermuda that offered various
financial products, including life, property and casualty insurance. The Bermuda Company was
the majority shareholder of ICBL.

de The âNew York Dental Company,â a corporation the identity of which is
known to the Grand Jury, was a dental company that was incorporated in New York in 1992 and
had an address in Elmont, New York. The New York Dental Company was thus a âdomestic
concernâ as that term is used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section
78dd-2(h)(1)(B).

8. Co-Conspirator 1 (âCC-1ââ), an individual whose identity is known to the
Grand Jury, was a United States citizen and a resident of Tampa, Florida. CC-1 was thus a
âdomestic concernâ as that term is used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section
78dd-2(h)(1)(A). CC-1 was the CEO of the New York Dental Company and owned and
controlled the company.

9, The Barbados Investment and Development Corporation (âBIDCâ) was an
agency of the government of Barbados. The defendant DONVILLE INNISS, as the Minister of

Industry, exercised authority over the BIDC.
Il. The Fraudulent Schemes

10. From in or about and between August 2015 and April 2016, the defendant
DONVILLE INNISS leveraged his positon as the Minister of Industry and engaged in a scheme
to accept approximately $36,000 in bribes from ICBL, in violation of Barbadian law, and to
launder that money to and through the United States. ICBL employees, including the
defendants INGRID INNES and ALEX TASKER, agreed to pay bribes to INNISS, who, in
return, agreed to use his official position as the Minister of Industry to cause the BIDC to renew
insurance contracts with ICBL.

11. In furtherance of the scheme, the defendant INGRID INNES, the
defendant ALEX TASKER and ICBL Executive 1 caused ICBLâs majority shareholder, the
Bermuda Company, to make bribe payments to the defendant DONVILLE INNISS through a
United States bank account in the name of the New York Dental Company, which had no actual
business with ICBL. ICBL employees, including INNES, TASKER and ICBL Executive 1, did
not disclose to the Bermuda Company that the payments were for the benefit of a Barbadian
government official and instead falsely claimed that the payments were for â[c]onsulting
services.â

T. In or about July 2015, the defendant DONVILLE INNISS, using his
official position as Minister of Industry, caused the BIDC to renew an insurance contract with
ICBL (the â2015 Contractâ). By its terms, the 2015 Contract required the BIDC to pay a
premium of approximately 661,469.30 Barbadian Dollars, which was the equivalent of

approximately $330,734.65, to ICBL.
13. In return, ICBL employees, including the defendants INGRID INNES and

ALEX TASKER, agreed to pay a bribe of approximately $16,536.73 to the defendant
DONVILLE INNISS, in consideration for having caused the BIDC to renew the 2015 Contract.
The bribe payment of approximately $16,536.73 was five percent of the premium that the BIDC
owed to ICBL under the 2015 Contract.

14. To conceal the bribe payments, the defendant DONVILLE INNISS
arranged to launder the bribes through a bank account at âBank 1,â a bank the identity of which
is known to the Grand Jury, with an address in Elmont, New York, in the name of the New York
Dental Company (the âNew York Dental Company Bank Accountâ). The payment was routed
through a branch of Bank 1| located in Brooklyn, New York. CC-1 was the authorized
representative of the New York Dental Company Bank Account.

15. On or about August 17, 2015, the Bermuda Company transferred
approximately $16,536.73 to the New York Dental Company Bank Account based on a false
invoice provided by the defendant INGRID INNES, the defendant ALEX TASKER and ICBL
Executive 1 for purported consulting services. On or about August 19, 2015, the New York
Dental Company transferred approximately $16,000 to a Bank 1 account in the United States in
the name of the defendant DONVILLE INNISS (the âINNISS Bank Accountâ) via a check
transaction. The New York Dental Company check for approximately $16,000 was made
payable to INNISS.

16. In or about March 2016, the defendant DONVILLE INNISS, using his
position as Minister of Industry, caused the BIDC to renew another insurance contract with
ICBL (the â2016 Contractâ).

17. In return, ICBL employees, including the defendants INGRID INNES and
ALEX TASKER, agreed to pay an additional bribe of approximately $20,000 to the defendant

DONVILLE INNISS, in consideration for having caused the BIDC to renew the 2016 Contract.
18. On or about April 18, 2016, the Bermuda Company transferred
approximately $20,000 to the New York Dental Company Bank Account based on a false
invoice provided by the defendant INGRID INNES, the defendant ALEX TASKER and ICBL
Executive 1 for purported consulting services. On or about April 25, 2016, the New York
Dental Company made transfers of approximately $9,000 and $8,000 to the INNISS Bank
Account via check transactions. The New York Dental Company checks for approximately
$9,000 and $8,000 were made payable to the defendant DONVILLE INNISS. On or about
April 27, 2016, the New York Dental Company transferred approximately $2,750 to the INNISS

Bank Account via a check transaction. The New York Dental Company check for $2,750 was

 

made payable to INNISS.
Ul. Barbados Prevention of Corruption Act
19. The Prevention of Corruption Act of Barbados (the âBarbados Prevention

of Corruption Actâ) provided in Section 3(1) that â[a]ny person who, by himself or by or in
conjunction with any person, corruptly solicits or receives or agrees to receive, for himself or for
any other person, any gift, loan, fee, reward or advantage whatsoever as an inducement to, or
reward for or otherwise on account of any member, officer or servant of the Crown or of a public
body doing or forbearing to do anything in respect of any matter or transaction whatsoever,
actual or proposed, in which the Crown or such public body is concerned, shall be guilty of a
misdemeanour.â

20. The Barbados Prevention of Corruption Act provided in Section 6 that â[a]
person convicted on indictment of a misdemeanour under this Act, where the matter or
transaction in relation to which the offence was committed was a contract, or a proposal for a

contract, with the Crown or any Government Department or any public body, or a sub-contract to
execute any work comprised in such a contract, shall be liable to imprisonment for any term not
exceeding seven nor less than three years.â

21. The Barbados Prevention of Corruption Act provided in Section 7 that
â[w]here, in any proceedings against a person for an offence under this Acct, it is proved that any
money, gift or other consideration has been paid or given to or received by a person in the
employment of the Crown or any Government Department or a public body by or from a person
or agent of a person holding or seeking to obtain a contract from the Crown or any Government
Department or public body, the money, gift or consideration shall, for the purposes of this Act,
be deemed to have been paid or given and received corruptly as inducement or reward, unless the

contrary is proved.â

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Monday, January 28, 2019

Former Chief Executive Officer and Senior Vice President of Barbadian Insurance Company
Charged with Laundering Bribes to Former Minister of Industry of Barbados

The former chief executive officer and senior vice president of Insurance Corporation of Barbados Limited (ICBL), a Barbados-based insurance
company, were charged in an indictment unsealed on Jan. 18, with laundering bribes to the former Minister of Industry of Barbados in exchange
for his assistance in securing government contracts for ICBL.

Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Richard P. Donoghue of the Eastern
District of New York and Assistant Director-in-Charge William F. Sweeney Jr. of the FBIâs New York Field Office made the announcement.

Ingrid Innes, 63, a citizen of Canada, and Alex Tasker, 58, a citizen of Barbados, were charged with one count of conspiracy to launder money
and two counts of money laundering in an indictment returned in Aug. 22, 2018, by a federal grand jury sitting in Brooklyn, New York. The
former Minister of Industry of Barbados, Donville Inniss, 52, a U.S. legal permanent resident who resided in Tampa, Florida, and Barbados, was
charged with the same crimes in an indictment unsealed on Aug. 6, 2018, and was also charged as a co-defendant of Innes and Tasker in the
superseding indictment.

The indictment alleges that in 2015 and 2016, Innes, then the chief executive officer of ICBL, and Tasker, then a senior vice president of ICBL,
took part in a scheme to launder into the United States approximately $36,000 in bribes that they paid to Inniss, who at the time was a member
of the Parliament of Barbados and the Minister of Industry, International Business, Commerce and Small Business Development of Barbados. In
exchange for the bribes, Inniss allegedly leveraged his positon as the Minister of Industry to enable ICBL to obtain two government contracts.
According to the allegations, Inniss arranged to receive the bribes through a U.S. bank account in the name of a dental company with an
address in Elmont, New York, in order to conceal the scheme.

The charges in the indictment are merely allegations, and the defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt
in a court of law.

ICBL voluntarily self-disclosed the case and received a declination under the FCPA Corporate Enforcement Policy. ICBL disgorged $93,940.19 in
illicit profits that it earned from the scheme.

The FBI's New York Field Office and International Corruption Squad is investigating the case. In 2015, the FBI formed International Corruption
Squads across the country to address national and international implications of foreign corruption.

Trial Attorney Gerald M. Moody Jr. of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Sylvia Shweder of the Eastern District of
New York are prosecuting the case. The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs provided significant assistance in this matter.

The Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) matters. Additional information
about the Departmentâs FCPA enforcement efforts can be found at www. justice.gov/criminal/fr

PROBABLECAUSE Â© |

16. In 2016, a Confidential Source (CS) approached the HSI Miami Office (HSI-
Miami) regarding 78 million in Euros the CS received, which originated from a loan contract with
PDVSA. The CS was involved in a money laundeting conspiracy and wanted to surrender the
money and cooperate. HSI-Miami thereafter began an undercover investigation: Organized Crime
and Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF) Operation Money Flight.

17. TheCs agreed to, wear a recording device and Operation Money Flight proceeded
proactively with an initial focus on the defendantsâ efforts to launder a portion of the 78 million in
Euros (the âPDVSA firhdsâ) in and through South Florida.

18. âTwo years and over one hundred recordings later, Operation Money Flight revealed
an international conspiracy to launder the PDVSA funds through Miami and several large-scale,
international third-party money-laundering organizations. More specifically, the investigation

revealed the use of Miami real estate and sophisticated false-investment schemes to: launder

hundreds of millions of U.S. Dollars.

Venezuelan Corruption & Miami Laundering
19. Venezuela has a foreign-currency exchange system under which the government
âwill exchange local currency (Bolivars) at a fixed rate for U.S. Dollars. The fixed exchange rate
has been well below the true economic rate by a substantial factor for several years. For example,
in 2014, the Venezuelan government fixed exchange rate was approximately six Bolivars to one
U.S. Dollar. By contrast, the true economic exchange rate was approximately sixty Bolivars to one
U.S. Dollar. Y

20. The difference betweenâ the fixed rate and the true economic rate creates
opportunity for fraud and abuse. c

21. For example, in 2014, an individual could exchange 10 million U.S. Dollars
for 600 million Bolivars at the true economic rate. Then, if that individual had access to the
government fixed rate, he could convert that sameâ600 million Bolivars into 100 million U.S.
Dollars. Essentially, in two transactions, thatâperson could buy 100 million U.S. Dollars for 10
million U.S. Dollars. â

22. Massive fraud and corruption is rampant throughout Venezuelaâs government-run
foreign-exchange system. Estimates of the fraud range as high as $20 billion a year, and reports
indicate that corrupt government officials take kickbacks to authorize exchanges at the fixed
rate. Z

23. Embezzlement of Venezuelaâs dwindling foreign currency reserves is the fuel for

these corrupt exchange schemes. PDVSA is Venezuelaâs primary source of income and foreign

currency (namely, U.S. Dollars and Euros), and serves as the source of foreign currency used to

corruption is reportedly common at PDVSA.

Dollar corrupt and criminal ecosystems thrive drives rivers of criminal proceeds through South
Florida, which has become an international money-laundering hub and a desirable destination for
well-to-do foreign criminals and kleptocrats.

False-Investment Money Laundering van

25. Most of the defendants are sophisticated operators with respect to the international
banking system and are aware of banksâ general due diligence and anti-money laundering
practices, including know-your-customer (K YC) requirements: .

26. Importantly, for one party to wire funds to a third party, there must be some
legitimate business justification provided to the bank: for instance, a payment for the purchase of
real estate or equipment. Moreover, a bank will ask for documents supporting the justification,
whichâdepending on the transactionâCan be difficult to manufacture; for instance, a bank may
be able to verify whether a supposed real estate transaction took place. This verification poses a
problem for money laundering transactions in which large sums of criminal proceeds must be
moved around the finaficial system from one person to another as bribes, kickbacks, transfers, or
exorbitant expenditures, for instance.

27. Accordingly, false investments in fake securities are convenient justifications in
that they are more difficult for a bank to investigate and verify. By way of example, one party
might wire 30 million U.S. Dollars to a third party with the justification that the amount is a loan

to the third party, supported by a 30 million U.S. Dollar promissory note due at some point in the

future, which neither party actually intends to honor. For the bank, ascertaining the true intent of
the parties and the fraudulent nature of the investment is difficult.

28. Sophisticated false-investment money laundering schemes are used throughout this
conspiracy, ranging from individual false securities (promissory notes and bonds) to entire false-
investment funds, which can be subscribed to as needed to justify transactions.

29. Surrounding and supporting these false-investment laundering schemes are
complicit money managers, brokerage firms, banks, and real estate investment firms in the United
States and elsewhere, operating as a network of professional money launderers.

Money Laundering Conspiracy .

30. The conspiracy in this case began in December 2014 with a currency exchange
scheme to embezzle approximately 600 million US. Dollars from PDVSA, obtained through
bribery and fraud, and the defendantsâ efforts to use the CS to launder a portion of the proceeds of
that scheme (the PDVSA funds). By May of*2015, the conspiracy had doubled in amount to 1.2
billion U.S. Dollars embezzled from PDVSA.

31. The facts of the âconspiracy set forth below are evidenced by electronic
communications and docunients, government records, financial records, recordings of phone
conversations and in-pÃ©rson meetings, and CS statements.

4 CONVIT & URDANETA Approach the CS

32. In 2014, URDANETA and CONVIT approached the CS with an offer to sell 100

million U.S. Dollars at a favorable Bolivar exchange rate and without the CS having to front the

Bolivars.
Case iTe-cr20085-KMW DBooumentS Entered on FLSD Docket 07/24/2018 Page 9 af 3s

33. | The CS agreed because the CS had clients in Venezuela to whom the CS could sell
the U.S. Dollars. From previous business dealings, the CS knew CONVIT obtained U.S. Dollars
from exchange contracts with PDVSA. |

34. |The CS expected to receive a simple buyer-seller foreign exchange (âforexâ)
contract to memorialize the agreement with CONVIT and URDANETA.

35. Over the course of the next month, January 2015, CONVIT, URDANETA, and the
CS continued to discuss and facilitate the supposed forex transaction, often via BlackBerry
Messenger (BBM) chats and while CONVIT was present in the Southern District of Florida,
according to U.S. travel and other records.â <

36. During this time, CONVIT delayed providing the forex contract to the CS, but this' ~
did not overly concern the CS because the funds were coming from a regulated asset management
firm, âEuropean Financial Institution 1,â which the Ã©s could explain to the receiving bank.

37. | The CS instructed CONVIT toâwire the funds from European Financial Institution
1 to an account belonging to a trust, of which the CS was the ultimate beneficiary. CONVIT agreed
and informed the CS that the funds âwould arrive in Euros and not U.S. Dollars.

38. By February, 12, 2015, the CS had received approximately 78.8 million Euros into
the trust from Europeari Financial Institution 1 in four separate wire transfers beginning on January
14, 2015. 4

39. After receiving the initial 36 million Euros in mid-January, the CS asked CONVIT

via BBM chat on January 13, 2015 if the CS could sell about 20 million Euros to a client, but

CONVIT replied âno.â CONVIT explained that he had already paid for the Bolivars on his end

 

* According to these records, CONVIT arrived in the Southern âDistrict of Florida on December
20, 2014 and departed on January 18, 2015.
Case [:bS-cr-20685-KMW Document friterecd on FLSD Docket 7/24/2018 Page LO of 33

(meaning he had no immediate need for Bolivars), and that the CS would have to wait about a
month to sell the Euros further.

40. On February 6, 2015, the CS informed CONVIT that the CS urgently needed the
forex contract between the CS and European Financial Institution 1 for the CSâs bankâs compliance
department. The CS asked CONVIT for a form draft so that the CS could prepare it.

41. That same day, CONVIT finally sent the CS a (PDF) document to justify the
transfer between European Financial Institution 1 and the CSâs trust. What CONVIT sent,
however, was a false joint venture contract between a Hong Kong shell company, Eaton Global
Services Limited, and the CSâs trust, with a forged signature on behalf of the CSâs trustee. The CS
had never seen this contract before.

42. The fake joint venture contract, dated December 17, 2014, contemplated a fictitious ;
600 million U.S. Dollar joint venture between Eaton Global and the CSâs trust; the supposed
business of the joint venture was the making of loans to PDVSA:

43, On February 9, 2015, the CS told CONVIT that the fake joint venture contract could
not be used. CONVIT and URDANETA assured the CS that the fake contract had not been used

)
or provided to any bank.

y

44. The CSâalso requested the original underlying exchange contracts and CONVIT
responded that URDANETA had physical copies and would deliver them. Days later in Venezuela,
the CS received the documents in-person from URDANETA, who explained that he obtained the
documents from âCONSPIRATOR 1,â a former PDVSA official.

45. These documents, which the CS provided to HSI-Miami, reveal the source of the

PDVSA funds and the nature of the scheme.
Case [:ES-cr-20685-KMW Document friterecd on FLSD Docket O7/24/2018 Page Li of 33

PDVSA Bribery & Embezzlement Scheme Revealed
46. Thesource of the PDVSA funds was a PDVSA foreign-currency exchange scheme
benefitting Eaton Global. The exchange scheme was disguised as a âfinancingâ arrangement using
the following three documents (provided by URDANETA) in an artless attempt to hide what was
ultimately revealed as an embezzlement:
a. First, a loan contract, dated December 17, 2014, between PDVSA
. and Rantor Capital C.A., a Venezuelan shell company, in which Rantorâagreed to
loan 7.2 billion Bolivars to PDVSA. The loan contract was executed by
âVENEZUELAN OFFICIAL 1â as Vice President of PDVSA;
b. Second, an assignment contract, dated December 23, 2014, between
Rantor and Eaton Global, in which Rantor assigns its rights as PDVSAâs creditor
under the loan contract to Eaton Global and in which it is contemplated that PDVSA
is given the right to cancel the debt within 180 days by paying 600 million U.S.
Dollars; and <
C. Third, a notice of assignment letter, dated December 23, 2014, in
which Eaton Global informs PDVSA (VENEZUELAN OFFICIAL 1) of the
assignment andâ suggests that PDVSA repay the 7.2 billion Bolivar loan in the Euro
equivalent of 600 million U.S. Dollars. The letter included instructions for PDVSA
to wire the funds to European Financial Institution 1 accounts for the benefit of
Eaton Global. |
47. In short, Eaton Global ended up with the right to pay PDVSA about 7.2 billion
Bolivars (worth around 35 million Euros) and receive about 510 million Euros, of which about

78.8 million Euros was sent to the CS.
Case iis-cr-20685-KMW Document Entered on FLSO Docket 07/24/2018 Page 12 of 33

48. While the CS continued to wait for a forex contract from CONVIT and
URDANETA, the CS began to conduct third-party transactions on their and CONSPIRATOR 1âs
behalf. Ultimately, the CS learned that the CS was not involved in a forex transaction, but rather a
money laundering operation in which the CS was expected to launder the proceeds of the
embezzlement and make cash kickback payments to VENEZUELAN OFFICIAL 1.

49. In April 2015, the CS began making cash payments in Venezuela at URDANETA
and CONSPIRATOR 1âs direction, including to URDANETA, CONSPIRATOR 1, and
VENEZUELAN OFFICIAL 1, which would ultimately total over 1 million U.S. Dollars.

50. In all, the CS conducted approximately 15 million Euros-worth of transactions
through the summer of 2015, including several U.S.-Dollar wire transactions at the defendantsâ
direction,â until the CS began to resist making further payments. Around that time, the CS used
the liquidation of the CSâs trustee as an excuse to halt payments: the CS claimed that the CS could
not continue without the forex contract. CONVIT and URDANETA continued to pressure the CS.
The ensuing impasse led to a meeting around November 2015 at CONVITâs office in Venezuela,

51. Around November 5015 , CONVIT summoned the CS to a meeting at CONVITâs
office in Caracas, Venezuela. Prior to the meeting, CONVIT explained to the CS that the CS would
meet AMPARAN, who was in charge of the financial documents.

52. At the meeting, CONVIT, URDANETA, AMPARAN, and the CS sat around a
table. CONVIT had a handgun on the table. Next to CONVIT was a German Shepard with a shock

collar. CONVIT held the remote for the collar, and commented that he could not always control

are routed and processed through banks located in the United States.

the dog. The meeting took place at CONVITâs office with numerous security guards; according to
the CS, the mood was one of intimidation by CONVIT.

53. | AMPARAN told the CS that the fake joint venture contract -had in fact been
provided to European Financial Institution 1âs banks in Canada and Malta. Accordingly,
AMPARAN explained that it would be impossible to replace the contract with a simple forex
contract and additional fake contracts were needed. The CS asked to return the PDVSA funds and
reverse the transactions, but was told a reversal was impossible. L

The CS Records the Defendants

54. Beginning in February 2016, the CS recorded conveisations with the defendants
and other conspirators in which they explicitly acknowledgedâ the money laundering conspiracy
and underlying embezzlement. As evidence by the following recordings, during this time, the cs
worked with URDANETA, ORTEGA, and CONSPIRATOR 1 to account for and distribute the
PDVSA funds to themselves and others andâto ensure that AMPARAN supplied the additional
fake contracts necessary to do so. |
55. In a-February 19, 2016 recorded meet with URDANETA, the CS complained that
the CS needed additional documents from AMPARAN. URDANETA agreed and said that he
would write to AMPARAN, CONVIT and âCONSPIRATOR 2â to âbug themâ about the
contracts. URDANETA also stated that they (CONVIT, et al.) are being âhit right nowâ by people
in the âassemblyâ and joked that it is not a âpifiata,â in an apparent reference to corrupt Venezuelan
officials hitting the defendants up for bribes. URDANETA also stated that he would not go to the

United States because the last time he was searched at the border and âthey took away [his] phone.

[And t]hank God [he] didnât have [his] phone, but a new phone.â

11
Case iiS-cr-20685-KMW Document 3S Entereci on FLSO Docket O7/24/2018 Page 14 of 83

56. In a February 22, 2016 recorded meet with ORTEGA, ORTEGA and the CS
discussed how to move ORTEGAâs money from the CS to ORTEGA. The CS explained that it is
not simple, and ORTEGA, regarding the source of his portion of the PDVSA funds, stated:

So we can be frank and open with each other. Now. You know the origin of that.

And that comes from... from something that is still making noise and itâs still

making noise and itâs still making noise. Itâs going to explode one day. [ mean,

maybe not tomorrow, and also, itâs not the... our friend, the leader in all this, he is
everywhere every day

ORTEGA also acknowledged CONSPIRATOR 1âs"" role in assigning him a portion of the PDVSA
funds and fretted aloud:

Itâs all that shit theyâve been talking about, investigatioris and shit. Or the
Americans going into all this, is that tue? How far does that reach?

But, how far could they get, in your opinion? If they get to the Swiss and they tell
them, âI want, I want this information.â Do they have to give it to them?

Finally, the CS and ORTEGA walked through somÃ© account opening forms and discussed how
ORTEGA could avoid declaring himself as a politically exposed person (also known as a PEP) on
bank KYC documents. a

57. In a February 23; 2016 recorded conversation with âCONSPIRATOR 3â
(CONSPIRATOR 1âs brother the CS explained that the CSâs trustee is liquidating and
âeventually thereâs a risk of the trustee checking the operationâ and finding that the âthe guys did
a fake deal, falsifying the signatures of these guys who are there.â The CS explained that the CS â
called URDANETA and CONSPIRATOR | and told them that they have to set the documentation
straight. The CS and CONSPIRATOR 3 also discussed a meeting in Caracas between the CS,
URDANETA, and AMPARAN about fixing the document, and CONSPIRATOR 3 noted that he

has a âpayment for [VENEZUELAN OFFICIAL 1].â

 

4 CONSPIRATOR 1 is a former PDVSA official.

12
Case BAB Cr 20685-R VW . Document S Entered on FLOD Docket O7/24/2018 Page 15 of 33

58. In a March 7, 2016 recorded meet with URDANETA, the CS and URDANETA
recounted the receipt and expenditure of the PDVSA funds to date (âseventy eight million eight
hundred and somethingâ). They recounted how much belonged to CONSPIRATOR 1 (âfourteen
million five hundred forty thousand six hundred twenty-fiveâ) and other expenditures, including a
list of cash payments to include payments to VENEZUELAN OFFICIAL 1 who authorized the
underlying PDVSA loan agreement. The CS recounted the cash kickbacks to VENEZUELAN
OFFICIAL 1 as follows: | 7 |

[VENEZUELAN OFFICIAL 1], I gave him... to the boy he sent-in one occasion

two hundred thousand [200,000], June fourth [4'*] and in another occasion one
hundred thousand [100,000], on June twenty sixth [26""). .

URDANETA agreed. URDANETA and the CS then discussed AMPARANâs plan to make new

| fake contracts justifying the transaction (the CS noted to URDANETA that AMPARAN is flying
to Miami in several days). URDANETA was conÃ©Ã©med that he didnât want to leave a trail of
âbreadcrumbsâ with respect to the accounts. URDANETA again acknowledged CONVITâs
involvement and CONSPIRATOR 1âs arrangement with ORTEGA. CONSPIRATOR 1 joined the
meeting and discussed with URDANETA and the CS the fake joint venture contract, who was
responsible for it, and how âto divide up the PDVSA funds.

59. Importantly, at this meeting, URDANETA and CONSPIRATOR 1 reviewed a
spreadsheet of all the cash payments and expenditures created by the CS; each acknowledged the
contents of the document, wrote notes on it, checked off transactions, and, ultimately, dated it. The
CS provided a copy of this document to HSI-Miami with both URDANETA and CONSPIRATOR
1âs handwritten notes ; included on the spreadsheet are the kickback payments to VENEZUELAN
OFFICIAL 1. |

60. In a March 9, 20 16 recorded meet with AMPARAN and URDANETA,

AMPARAN ran through the plan to replace the fake joint venture agreement with new documents.

s

13
Case U18-cr-20685-KMW BocumentS Erierecd on FLSO Docket O7/24/2018 Page 16 of 33

AMPARAN explained that the fake agreement could be replaced with the new (better) fake ones
in the compliance file at the Canadian bank and added to the file at European Financial Institution
1, and further that the âAccounting Firm 1â auditors are on board. AMPARAN explained that he
is flying to Miami the next day and from there he will print out and provide the CS with the new
fake contracts.

61. In a March 15, 2016 recorded meet with ORTEGA, ORTEGA explained to the CS
that he has found a âpersonâ (GUSTAVO) with a âstructureâ to transfer his PDVSA funds to
ORTEGA, and asks the CS to meet with the person in New York, Miami; or Panama. ORTEGA
asked the CS what the CSâs story is and why the CS is acting differently âovernightâ and whether
it is âan investigationâ; the CS explained that everyone is âmaking messes,â that the CS has
âstart[ed] to find out about stuff... the [CS] didnâ t know,â and that the CSi 1S stopping because the
CS doesnât want to get into trouble. ORTEGA explaiced that the rumor is that the âAmericans are
investigating you, that you are in big troubleâ and asked the CS whether the CS is under
investigation and what the banks have asked the CS.

62. In an April 2, 2016 recorded meet with ORTEGA and GUSTAVO in Panama,
ORTEGA introduced the CS to GUSTAVO, who explained how he can launder money using his
brokerage firm and private mutual fund. Specifically, GUSTAVO explained that his brokerage
firm, GSA, operates from the United States, but primarily does business in Latin America and
manages $2 billion.* Regarding GSAâs reputation, GUSTAVO explained:

I would say that our profile, would be by-by nature a business that we prioritized

the type of client with which we deal, uh...letâs say if it is a low profile, we go even
, D

 

> I am further aware, that GSA is affiliated with Global Strategic Investments, LLC (GSI), which
is a broker/dealer headquartered in Miami, Florida. GUSTAVO and the CS would later conduct
numerous meetings at GSIâs office in Miami.

14
 

lower, that way they will never talk about us, or any advertising, or any cocktail
parties.

GUSTAVO explained that they operate a fake mutual fund which receives money from a payment
made to look like an investment into the fund, but is actually laundered out of the fund. GUSTAVO
explained that âweâll make the transactions in such a way that the purchase will look legitimateâ
and that the money can be directed anywhere on the back-end using âcardsâ or âchecksâ or even
âwire transfers,â but as to the latter he (GUSTAVO) will âalways be on the lookout to see the
transfer and whoâs receiving it, because...[l]ike the saying goes, the fish dies by its mouth. ...they
have their eyes on everyone.â GUSTAVO went on to explain how he ean avoid being tracked by
the authorities such as Interpol and acknowledged that ORTEGA and the CSâs situation is a âtime
bomb.â Finally, GUSTAVO insisted that they use WhatsApp to communicate and avoid emails.Â®
Cooperation Begins & Conspiracy Continues in Miami

63. In April 2016, the CS began cooperating with HSI-Miami and continued making
consensual recordings with the defendants and other conspirators.

64. The conspiracy continued in four primary aspects. First, AMPARAN worked to
replace the fake joint venture contact with better fake contracts to justify the initial transfers to the
CS. Second, AMPARAN worked to launder URDANETAâs portion of the PDVSA funds. from
the CS using false investments. Third, GUSTAVO worked to launder ORTEGAâs portion of the
PDVSA funds fom the CS, also using false investments. And fourth, KRULL and GUSTAVO

worked to launder additional PDVSA funds that did not originally flow through the CS.

 

6 Based on my training and experience, encrypted peer-to-peer chat services, such as WhatsApp,
are preferred by individuals engaged in criminal activity because law enforcement is generally
unable to obtain the content of the communications from the service provider.

15
Case 1: bS-cr-20685-K MW Document 3S friterecd on FLSD Docket O7/24/2018 Page 18 of 33

65. During the course of this conspiracy, GUSTAVO also laundered funds as part of a
scheme to promote international narcotics trafficking. KRULL also contacted the CS with several
separate plans to launder money from at least one foreign bribery scheme, all as set forth below.

AMPARANâs Replacement of the Fake Joint Venture Contract

66. Ina recorded April 27, 2016 meet with AMPARAN at the Miami, Florida office of
Solar Cargo, Inc.,7 AMPARAN and the CS discussed the fake joint venture contract and
AMPARAN acknowledged that it was meant to justify the movement of the PDVSA funds to the
cs and that CONVIT was involved. AMPARAN assured the CS not toâworry about European
Financial Institution 1 and the fake contract because European FinanÃ©ial Institution 1 will let him
know if there is an investigation and AMPARAN âcan manipulate that.â AMPARAN and the CS
discussed supplemental fake contracts AMPARAN had previously prepared and provided.
AMPARAN also began to explain how he will lander URDANETAâs portion of the PDVSA
funds using fake bonds. â

67. On or around May 26,: 5016, the CS received a BBM chat from AMPARAN
instructing him where in Venezuela to pick up the proposed fake contracts. The CS had an assistant
pick up the replacement fake contracts from AMPARAN and provided them to HSI-Miami.

68. On May 25, 2016, URDANETA sent a BBM chat to the CS stating that
âT*âCONSPIRATOR 4%] ... has an offer and I prefer you to speak directly with him.â On May 27,

2016, the CS had a recorded call with CONSPIRATOR 4, and explained to CONSPIRATOR 4

that the CS was working with AMPARAN to fix things and that the CS had explained to the bank '

 

7 AMPARAN explained in the recorded meet that he works for Solar Cargo, that it has six planes
operating, and that he had recently been hired by PDVSA to move medicine from Iran to
Venezuela.

8 CONSPIRATOR 4 is associated with CONVIT and formerly with PDVSA .

16
Case [:bS-cr-20685-K MW Document frierecd on FLSD Docket 7/24/2018 Page 19 of 33

that the PDVSA funds were from an exchange transaction. CONSPIRATOR 4 responded âOh they
made it upâ and the following conversation ensued: |

CONSPIRATOR 4: This is bad. This is bad when not-not-not... The truth is not
L spoken and canât-canât-canât even do [unintelligible]
regarding it since it never happened.

CS: Uh-huh. But...the truth was a foreign exchange transaction,
correct?

CONSPIRATOR 4: The truth it was, was, was not a foreign exchange.
transaction. It does not exist in Bolivars. Not atall, it was
a payment [unintelligible]

CONSPIRATOR 4 suggested a meeting in Venezuela with everyone who has âan interestâ to sort
things out and fix âthe papersâ before things get bad when it is too-late.

69. On June 13, 2016, the CS met with AMPARAN in Venezuela and they executed
replacement fake contracts. The replacement fake contracts (later provided to HSI-Miami by the
CS) included a complex array of bogus financing and trust documents involving Rantor, the CSâs""
trust, and other entities.

70. On June 22, 2016, AMPARAN sent the CS an email with a fake loan agreement
between Solar Cargo and Rantot meant to supplement the replacement fake contracts. In BBM
chats between AMPARAN and the CS in August 2016, AMPARAN asked if the CS received the
latest contract, and the CS responded yes. On September 5, 2016, AMPARAN sent the final fake
contract between Solar Cargo and a company belonging to the CS. All of these replacement fake
contracts were backdated to early 2014.

AMPARAN and URDANETAâs Efforts to Continue Laundering PDVSA Funds

71. As mentioned above, in an April 27, 2016 recorded meet with AMPARAN in

Miami, the efforts to launder URDANETAâs portion of the PDVSA funds from the CS occurred

_ simultaneously to AMPARANâs efforts to replace or supplement the fake joint venture contract.

17
Case [:bS-cr-20685-KMW Document frierecd on FLSD Docket 7/24/2018 Page 20 of 33

During that meet, AMPARAN explained how he would launder URDANETAâs portion of the
PDVSA funds using the purchase of a fraudulent bond designed to default to conceal the transfer:

we are now working through a mechanism, through which, we issue a bond through
a bank, from which we have, eh, on which we have a lot of influence, or several
banks, but one in particular that is the one, we are working with right now, we issue
a bond. ... That you on that side would buy, you would make an investment in that
bond, we receive, um, that, eh, receive that money for the purchase of that bond
and you keep the bond on that side. In the term of, a number of months, that bond
starts going down in price, ... until there comes a moment when it flips, ... but the
account is never closed, nor, nor are funds transferred, the funds never leave, and
an investment is made. â4

72. In a May 12, 2016 recorded call with URDANETA, URDANETA and the CS
recounted the CSâs meeting with AMPARAN and the- defaulting-bond laundering plan.
URDANETA brought up an apartment âover thereâ in Miami for which he paid a significant

deposit that he is being pressured to close on in 60 days by the developer and agreed to send the

a
Lf

CS the notice from the developer.

2, URDANETA later sent the @S an image of a May 10, 2016 email from the
developer of the Porsche Design Tower in Miami, informing him of the upcoming closing on the
unit. The email included âPre Closing Questionnaireâ provided by the developer contains the
following warning: âNote: taking title under a company or trust may trigger FinCEN reporting
requirements.â In a follow up chat with the CS, URDANETA explained that he was worried about
the FinCEN reporting requirement and discussed ways to minimize the risk; URDANETA
suggested forming a new company with his wife as the beneficial owner.

74. In a May 17, 2016 recorded call with URDANETA, URDANETA discussed the

transfer of the Miami condominium with the equity of URDANETAâs down payment to

AMPARAN as a fee for AMPARANâs laundering services. And, ina May 18, 2016 recorded meet

18
Case [:ES-cr-20685-KMW Document friterecd on FLSD Docket O7/24/2018 Page 21 of 33

with AMPARAN at Solar Cargo in Miami, AMPARAN and the CS discussed using the Miami
condominium as a feeâ and moving forward with the defaulting-bond laundering plan. :

75. In a November 21, 2016 BBM chat, AMPARAN provided the details of an
additional fraudulent bond purchase to launder URDANETAâs PDVSA funds and explained that
the bond purchase will be facilitated through a U.K. broker dealer, âEuropean Financial Institution
2.â

76. In a March 1, 2017 recorded meet, the CS met with URDANETA, AMPARAN,
âCONSPIRATOR 5,â!â and GOIS, at the offices of European Company 1-in Madrid, Spain. Prior
to the meeting, URDANETA was captured on the recording explaining âto the CS that the CS:
should not be concerned about the fake joint venture contract-or being caught because they only
had to worry about the United States and the âAmericans ... have no jurisdictionâ; URDANETA
uses the word âlaunderâ to describe their activities. â

77. The purpose of the meeting was for the CS to gain comfort with the âoperationâ
proposed by AMPARAN. CONSPIRATOR 5 and GOIS were introduced as the managers of the
operation and meant to comfort the CS, who had relayed misgivings to URDANETA about
working with AMPARAN,, .

78. During'the meeting, GOIS asked if there is anything he can tell the CS to make him

more comfortable and the CS noted that he was concerned about European Financial Institution 2

â

 

Â°AMPARAN and URDANETA would later report that they worked out a solution to achieve the
transfer. Miami-Dade Property records show that the property was transferred from the developer
to Paladium Real Estate Group LLC on January 12, 2017. According to the Florida Department of
State, Paladium was formed on May 26, 2016 with URDANETAâs wife as an owner. On
September 23, 2016, AMPARANâs wife was added as a manager of Paladium, and on September
15, 2017, after the closing, URDANETAâs wife was removed, leaving AMPARAN in control of Â©
Paladium and the condominium.

because they asked âno questionâ and had âno objectionâ when an account was opened in the CSâs
name to purchase the fake bond. GOIS explained that there is no issue with European Financial
Institution 2, AMPARAN, GOIS, and CONSPIRATOR 5 went on to explain that they manage a
fund which allows them'foâ* generate payment structures, and third party payments institution, with
a very light KYC.ââ AMPARAN emphasized that they can make payments to âMiami, Panama,
Europeâ: the CS clarified, âAnd you have no issues paying in the United States?â, to which
AMPARAN replied, âNo.â GOIS explained that the CS should first buy a U.K. GILT, then
transfer it to an account in the CSâs name at European Financial Institution 2, after which it will
be swapped with the fake bond to begin the transfer to URDANETA.â |
~79. On April 26, 2017, the CS, at the request of GOIS and URDANETA, purchased a
5-million-pound U.K. GILT. On June 20, 2017, the CS, at the request of GOIS, ordered his bank,
to âfree deliverâ the GILT to an account opened for fhe CS at European Financial Institution 2. At
European Financial Institution 2, GOIS would oversee an operation to have the GILT exchanged
for a separate worthless bond, so the funds could ultimately be transferred to and concealed for
URDANETA. Thereafter, the patties continued to discuss the movement of the balance of
~ URDANETAâs portion of the PDVSA funds through 2018, though-no additional funds have been
moved to date. ra
80. Inâ a recorded December 11, 2017 meet with GOIS in the U.K., GOIS explained
how European Company 1 is the front supporting the laundering operation with the fake bond, and
that AMPARAN, CONSPIRATOR 5, and âCONSPIRATOR 6â!! are the directors. GOIS alsoâ ~

lamented their criminal exposure, and advised the CS as follows:

...the faster you get out, the better for you. Because if you... theyâre going to lock
us all up. That... Iâm telling you, [CS], what do you want me to tell you? That itâs

 

'l CONSPIRATOR 6 is a third-party money launderer.

20
 

not like that? Itâs the truth, thereâs going to be a day that they are going to lock all
of us up; they are going to lock us up. This will be known. [CS], I have no doubt.
I already saw where the shit comes from. I saw where it comes from, how theyâre
doing things, then in the end, whoever has the money is the one who is going to
have problems. The rest, well, he will have to defend himself, saying âLook, I got
paid here.â Youâll defend yourself in your own way, Iâll defend myself in the same
way. But that will happen

ORTEGA and GUSTAVOâs Efforts to Continue Laundering PDVSA Funds

81. Also beginning in April 2016, ORTEGA and GUSTAVO continued their efforts to
launder ORTEGAâs portion of the PDVSA funds through GUSTAVOâs fake mutual fund, which
culminated in the actual movement of funds about a year later. e |

82. In February 2017, the CS laundered some of ORTEGAâs portion of the PDVSA

âfunds with GUSTAVOâs fake mutual fund structure at ORTEGAâs direction. On February, 21,

2017, GUSTAVO emailed the CS subscription instructions and a subscription agreement for the
fake fund. Per these documents, the name of the find was Global Securities Trade Finance, aw
Cayman Islands entity, and the custodian bank was âUS Financial Institution 1â in New Jersey.
On February 24, 2017, the CS instructed 4 bank in the Bahamas (where a portion the PDVSA funds
were then held) to subscribe to the fund per the instructions in the amount of 5,000,0000 US.
Dollars. Thereafter, on or around February 28, 2017, that amount was wired to U.S. Financial
Institution 1; the fake subscription was obtained by the CS, and the 5,000,000 U.S. Dollars was
available for further use by ORTEGA.

83, In a March 29, 2017 recorded meet in Miami, Florida, the CS asked GUSTAVO
about U.S. Financial Institution 1 and GUSTAVO explained that the bank is controlled by his
partners in Uruguay, who also control another bank in Puerto Rico (âU.S. Financial Institution 2â)

and that they âhave our people in the backâ of the bank.

21
Case :bS-cr-20685-KMW Document friterecd on FLSD Docket O7/24/2018 Page 24 of 33

84. Innumerous BBM chats between the CS and ORTEGA, ORTEGA asks how things
are going with âGâ (GUSTAVO) and acknowledges the ongoing laundering of his (ORTEGAâs)
funds.

85. Later in April 2017, GUSTAVO, with ORTEGAâs agreement, laundered $400,000

. of the $5,000,000 back to the CS as the CSâs âfeeâ for the CSâs role in facilitating the laundering
of ORTEGAâs$5,000,000 to GUSTAVO. The CS provided GUSTAVO with an undercover (UC)
bank account in the name of a shell company in the Southern District of Floridato receive the fee.
On April 24, 2017, GUSTAVO wired $396,000 from U.S. Financial Institution 1 to the UC .
account. To âjustify,â i.e., conceal, the transaction, GUSTAVO created a fake loan contract
between the UC shell company and Global Securities Trade Finance.

86.  Thenext stage of this scheme was the laundering of the fake subscription out of the |
CSâs account and into an account ultimately benefiting ORTEGA in order to eliminate any final
trace of the movement. GUSTAVO and ORTEGA proposed several methods for this, which the
CS rejected. These efforts continue to this day. Over the course of the summer of 2017, however, .
GUSTAVO revealed his connections to yet another complicit US. financial institution, U.S.
Financial Institution 2, in an effort to launder the subscription.

87. In a rec6rded June 7, 2017 meet with GUSTAVO, GUSTAVO told the CS that he
works with U.S.Financial Institution 2, that he knows the owner, and that he can facilitate things:
âSure, and discreet. And the good thing about [U.S. Financial Institution 2] is that without being,
without being in U.S., it is in U.S....in Puerto Rico.â GUSTAVO later introduced the CS to
GUTIERREZ, the majority shareholder of U.S. Financial Institution 2, and the CS and

GUTIERREZ agreed to meet in the future.

22
 

88. On July 31, 2017, GUTIERREZ flew to Miami from Uruguay to meet with the CS. }
During a rÃ©corded meet on July 31, 2017 with GUTIERREZ in Miami, the CS explained td
GUTIERREZ that the CS needed to transfer GUSTAVOâs fund subscription to GUSTAVOâs
âclientâ (ORTEGA) with no trail. The CS and GUTIERREZ discussed options including internal
account-to-account transfers at U.S. Financial Institution 2.

89. In a recorded August 14, 2017 call with GUTIERREZ, GUTIERREZ and the CS
further discussed the subscription to GUSTAVOâs fund. GUTIERREZ offered possible schemes
to justify the transaction using U.S. Financial Institution 2 and agreÃ©d that U.S. Financial
Institution 2 will charge a two-and-a-half percent (2.5%) fee. c

90. During a recorded August 15, 2017 meet with GUSTAVO in Miami, Florida, the
CS complained to GUSTAVO about how explicit GUTIERREZ was regarding their criminal

| | c
activities because he seemed reckless, and the following conversation ensued as GUSTAVO
attempted to reassure the CS that GUTIERREZ did not know about the ORTEGA âkick-backsâ:
cs I mÃ©an, I didnât tell him, âLook, this Ortega
thing is a kick-back,â but I imagine that he
a ~ knows what it is, mean...
GUSTAVO No, no, I havenât told him anything at all, I
: mean, zero [0], zero [0], zero [0]. And I
a will never tell him anything because itâs not
necessary. I never say anything to these
4 people because you donât need to. There
_isnât, I mean... everything is done well.

91. ORTEGA ultimately rejected the U.S. Financial Institution 2 option because he

wanted to avoid the United States. The transfer of the subscription remains unresolved.
GUSTAVOâs Other Laundering Schemes
92. During the course of multiple meetings in Miami with the CS, GUSTAVO

attempted to develop a relationship with the CS as a potential feeder of additional criminal clients

23
Case DLd-cr-20685-KMW Document Erterec on FLSD Docket O7/24/2018 Page 26 of 33

in need of money laundering. Indeed, GUSTAVO would go on to encourage and develop
additional money laundering schemes with the CS, touting his connections at multiple U.S.
financial institutions along the way, including other broker/dealers, in addition to U.S. Financial
Institutions 1 & 2.

93. In a November 8, 2016 recorded meet in Miami, the CS conducted a sting against
GUSTAVO, informing GUSTAVO about a âclientâ who had to buy a plane in Brazil that is âdoing
a delicate jobâ and is âgoing to move ... sensitive merchandise.â Prior to the cs proposing this
transaction, GUSTAVO assured the CS that the CS could speak franklyâas they were âbeyond
good and evil.â The CS explained that the client needed to pay someone in Spain for the plane,
but that the payment could not be traced back to the plane because âthere could be a risk ... the
authorities eventually investigate the plane.â GUSTAVO responded âokâ and âuh huhâ without
hesitation. The CS further explained that source money is in the United States and is completely
clean. GUSTAVO suggested some options and quickly agreed: âWeâll open an account right away
... and weâll make the paymentâ and tat they will justify receiving the payment by selling the
âclientâ a âproduct,â ie., a false investment. The CS and GUSTAVO agree to only charge the
âclientâ ten percent (30,000 U.S. Dollars) in the hopes that he will do more business with them.

94. Thereafter, GUSTAVO and the CS discussed the logistics of the transfer on several

â occasions. In Jariuary 9, 2017 recorded meet, the CS explained to GUSTAVO that the CS was
worried about ORTEGA and the money they (Venezuelan kleptocrats) are moving more than the
CS was âwortied about the plane, the DEA.â GUSTAVO responded, âYes, yes.â

95. On January 10, 2017, the CS and GUSTAVO commenced the transaction. Upon

the CS receiving instructions from GUSTAVO, HSI-Miami wired 300,000 U.S. Dollars from a

UC account in the Southern District of Florida to a U.S. Wells Fargo account held by Global

24
Case 1: bS-cr-20685-KMW Document friterecd on FLSD Docket O7/24/2018 Page 2? of 33

Securities Management LLC, and, on or around January 13, 2017, the funds were received in a
UC account in Spain as instructed. As previously agreed, GUSTAVO emailed the CS a fake
300,000 U.S. Dollar loan contract to support the initial transaction as well as an invoice from
Global Securities Management in the amount of 30,000 U.S. Dollars for âLoan Structuring.â
KRULLâs Conspires to Launder Additional PDVSA Funds with GUSTAVO

96. In October 2016, the CS met with KRULL in Panama. KRULL explained that he
was looking for a bank to deposit approximately 600,000,000 U.S. Dollars: from a currency
exchange with PDVSA on behalf of a client, âCONSPIRATOR 7,â!? and which the CS learned
were located in Gazprombank. The CS stated the CS could exploreâsome options but needed a
contract proving the source of funds. On November 8, 2016, KRULL explained that he had the
contract. In a November 17, 2016 WhatsApp chat, KRULL asked if the CS had âthe hushâ
(meaning hushmail, an encrypted email provider), and the CS provided a hushmail address. That
same day a PDVSA loan contract arrived at tle CSâs hushmail account.

97. | The PDVSA contract that the CS received from KRULL was an amendment to the
original contract between PDYSA âand Rantor, and doubled the credit line from 7.2 to 14 billion
Bolivars. The amendment ,was dated May 25, 2015, and specifically incorporated the initial
PDVSA loan contract.â

98. Over the course of the next few weeks, KRULL continued to press the issue over
WhatsApp chats, explaining his client was in a âhurry.â On November 30, 2016, the CS and
KRULL met again in Panama. Per the CS, KRULL explained that the funds came from exchange

contracts which generated around 1.2 billion U.S. Dollars. KRULL explained that, in addition to

 

2 CONSPIRATOR 7 is another reported billionaire member of the âboliburguÃ©sâ and owner of a
television network in Venezuela.

25
 

the 600-million-Dollar solution for CONSPIRATOR 7, KRULL needed an additional solution for
200 million U.S. Dollars held in European Financial Institution 1 in the name of a straw owner,
âCONSPIRATOR 8.â (The CS recognized CONSPIRATOR 8 as a straw owner previously
proposed to be used to conceal money for the stepsons of VENEZUELAN OFFICIAL 2, a.k.a,
âlos chamos,â during a prior meeting with the CONSPIRATOR 8, CONVIT, and âlos chamos.âââ)

99. On November 30, 2016, KRULL sent the CS a WhatsApp message with photos of
CONSPIRATORS 7 and 8âs Venezuelan passports. KRULL also forwarded an email to the CS
explaining the European Financial Institution 1 structure; the email was in fact a string of
previously forwarded emails attaching documents from Buropean Financial Institution 1, which
had been sent from AMPARAN to âCONSPIRATOR 9,â to CONSPIRATOR 7, to KRULL, and
to the CS. . |

100. In early December 2016, the CS infotmed KRULL of a solution for laundering the
additional PDVSA funds. The CS ultimately pfoposed GUSTAVO and his mutual-fund laundering
solution. On December 21, 2016, KRULL sent the CS a resume for CONSPIRATOR 8, whom
KRULL referred to as his âbuddy.* In a later recorded January 7, 2017 phone call with KRULL,
the CS explained that he could not use the CONSPIRATOR 8 resume, noting ââthis shit is a joke.â
KRULL agreed, âYesyitâs a joke.... I agree, I agree.â |

101. In a recorded January 9, 2017 meet with GUSTAVO in Miami, the cs asked
GUSTAVO for a solution similar to ORTEGAâs for CONSPIRATORS 7 & 8, and GUSTAVO -
immediately agreed. GUSTAVO noted that CONSPIRATOR 7 has one of the wealthiest fortunes
from the ââchavismo.ââ GUSTAVO walked through all the different laundering options for both and
how to handle any âK YCâ issues. KRULL later agreed to the solution presented by GUSTAVO,

and in BBM chats would acknowledge âGustavoâ when inquiring of the status. The CS and

26
 

KRULL and the CS and GUSTAVO had numerous recorded conversations and message chats
about the scheme over the course of months.

102. In a January 10, 2017 recorded. conversation, KRULL noted that
âTCONSPIRATOR 7]â is asking if the money can be sent. In another, on January 23, 2017,
KRULL said the money at European Financial Institution 1 is ready to be moved to
CONSPIRATOR 8 and thatââI met the dude, and also met the guy that represents him.â The CS
asked, âAre these the guyâs sons?â (meaning the stepsons of VENEZUELAN OFFICIAL 2), and
KRULL responded, âNah. Donât, donât, donât ask.â

103. Ina January 31, 2017 recorded call, the CS informed KRULL that he is in Miami
and both discuss the laundering further. KRULL acknowledged receiving money from the.
European Financial Institution 1 accounts before (i.e., other laundering activity) when he described
how the wires work. <

104. On March 7, 2017, KRULL sÃ©nt the CS a WhatsApp chat and explained that the
clients are asking about GUSTAVOâs fuitd being in the United States. In a March 7, 2017 recorded
call, KRULL advised that â[CONSPIRATOR 7|â is worried, and the CS explained that the fund
is not in the United States, but that GUSTAVO has offices in the United States (Miami and New
York). The CS explainÃ©d that GUSTAVO lives in Miami. KRULL asked if GUSTAVO can fly to
Panama, and the-CS assured KRULL he could.

105. âOn March 16, 2017, the CS met with KRULL and CONSPIRATOR 8 in Panama,
and at one point called GUSTAVO (who was not in Panama) to discuss the laundering operation.
During the meeting, CONSPIRATOR 8 stated that he ârepresented three persons.â After the
meeting, KRULL confided to the CS that he had once seen CONSPIRATOR 8 at CONSPIRATOR

7âs office having lunch with âlos chamos,â i.e., the stepsons of VENEZUELAN OFFICIAL 2.

27
Case ]:bS-cr-20685-KMW Document friterecd on FLSD Docket O7/24/2018 Page 30 cf 33

-

106. Inarecorded April 5, 2017 call with KRULL, KRULL stated that CONSPIRATOR
8 was worried about wiring funds to purchase GUSTAVOâs fraudulent fund to U.S. Financial
Institution 1 in New Jersey because he was worried about using U.S. banks. KRULL explained
that he told CONSPIRATOR 8 it was irrelevant because all U.S. Dollar wire transactions travel
through correspondent banks in the United States regardless.

107. Ina recorded April 14, 2017 meet in Miami with KRULL, KRULL and the CS
discussed GUSTAVO and CONSPIRATOR 7 and the plan to launder the other PDVSA funds.

108. GUSTAVO and KRULL would continue to discuss this scheme with the CS for
months thereafter. For instance, in a recorded call with KRULL on August 2, 2017, the CS told
KRULL, âI am going to be with GUSTAVO tomorrow ... and heâs going to ask me about the fund
with the children.â KRULL explained that he is not sure, but that âCONSPIRATOR 7â may be
doing something on it with âChenteâ (AMPARAN) had explained that he (KRULL) speaks mostly
to â[CONSPIRATOR 8]â about it because heâis âthe client.â

109. Records obtained from erfail search warrants confirm the flow of the PDVSA funds
from PDVSA to the defendants and other conspirators through European Financial Institution 1.
For instance, a September 201 5 email circulated among AMPARAN and CONSPIRATORS 5 and:
6 with the subject lineââNumeros [CONSPIRATOR 7] includes an attachment titled âOperation
600k,â which contains the following work sheets:

a. A work sheet titled âDetailed Income from PDVSAâ shows ten
transfers from PDVSA from December 29, 2014 through February 3, 2015 totaling
511,913,270.74 Euros. .

b. A work sheet titled âSummary of the 600 Operationâ shows that, of

the 511 million Euros: 20,476,530.83 was assigned to European Financial

28
Case 1i8-cr-20885-KMW Document S Entered on FLSO Docket 07/24/2018 Page 31 of 33

Institution 1 as a 4% fee; 227,265,537.52 Euros went to the âBOLIâ (CONVIT andâ
CONSPIRATOR 2); 159,085,876.26 Euros went to âCHAMOSâ (the stepsons of
VENEZUELAN OFFICIAL 2); and 68,179,661.26 Euros went to CONSPIRATOR
7. The remaining 36,905 ,664.87 Euros was accounted for as the âCostâ of the initial
7.2 billion Bolivars used to obtain the 511 million Euros.
c. Further worksheets account for how each recipient moved the
money. The âBOLIâ for instance moved 78.8 million Euros to the CS and the
majority of the rest through apparent shell companies, Volbor Vontobel and
Vencon Holding. CONSPIRATOR 7 sent dozens of US, Dollar wires through
banks in Malta and Austria, including to aviation and yacht services as well as
brokerage companies in Miami, Florida.
These records not only exhibit the conspiracy in blint detail, but confirm the connection among
KRULL and the additional conspirators and the initial 78.8 million Euros in PDVSA funds
received by the CS. <
KRULLâs Additional V Venezuelan Laundering Schemes

110. Throughout,the course of KRULLâs scheme to launder the additional PDVSA
funds with the CS, KRULL presented other laundering schemes to the CS: One of the schemes
involved a relative of VENEZUELAN OFFICIAL 3 who needed a way to receive kickbacks from
foreign law firms who had been hired by the Government of Venezuela.

111. KRULL first approached the CS with this scheme in the summer of 2017 because

KRULL needed a laundering structure for receiving the kickbacks. Both KRULL and the CS

agreed that GUSTAVO was again a good laundering option.

29
Case :1S-cr-20685-KMW Document frierecd on FLSD Docket 7/24/2018 Pade 32 of 33

112. On June 29, 2017, KRULL called the CS and, in a recorded conversation, the CS
told KRULL that he is in Los Angeles, California. KRULL said he has to be âcandid and directâ
and stated:

Uh, Iâm sitting here with, with, with, with the [title of VENEZUELAN OFFICIAL

3]âs brother.... And, and, and well, they, they, they have earned in the last years a

payment theyâre going to receive that is for five [5]....Okay? And, and, and we

have been talking about the, the, the options they, they might have. Right? And,

and, and I donât know if, if, if you have something that you, that you might think
of, as to how it can be, uh, things can be structured. Right?

113. The CS noted that it may be difficult based on the recipient's piofile, but said they
can talk more tomorrow and explained he will be flying to Miami then. Ina later recorded call on
June 29, 2017, KRULL further specified that these were payments from law firms that had handled
international arbitrations on the Venezuelan governmentâs behalf with international companies and
had charged the government a lot of money (5,000,000 U.S. Dollars). In a recorded call the next
day, June 30, 2018, the CS, KRULL, and VENEZUELAN OFFICIAL 3âs brother discussed ways
to launder the payment which was again explicitly described as payments deriving from law firms
who represented Venezuelan government in arbitrations. Different options for laundering the
payments and âKYCâ requiremÃ©nts were discussed.

114. Ina recordÃ©d August 25, 2017 meet with GUSTAVO in Miami, the CS explained
that KRULL had two sjients related to VENEZUELAN OFFICIAL 3 who needed a way to launder
the payments they are going to receive from attorneys who were hired by the Venezuelan
government. The CS specifically stated âthe lawyers are giving them their. kick backsâ and
GUSTAVO responded, âMm-hmmm.â The CS then suggested that the lawyers themselves would
pay the kickback, and GUSTAVO immediately corrected him:

No, they canât pay these two [2] guys. No, thatâs impossible.... Just imagine.

Specially nowadays with OFAC, and with all of these people reviewing every
money transfer every day. .... Brother, thatâs kindergarten Algebra. Right? Well,

30
 

we will have to give a vehicle to each one of these guys...A private fund...The
same thing we did for [ORTEGA].

115. Inrecorded meetings on August 29, 2017 and November 14, 2017 with KRULL in
Miami, the CS and KRULL further discussed the kick-back laundering scheme.
CONCLUSION
116. Based on the foregoing, probable cause exists that the defendants conspired to
launder monetary instruments, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1956(h), and
did travel in and use facilities of interstate and foreign commerce to further the laundering

activities, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1952. y -

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Wednesday, October 31, 2018

Former Executive Director at Venezuelan State-Owned Oil Company, Petroleos De Venezuela,
S.A., Pleads Guilty to Role in Billion-Dollar Money Laundering Conspiracy

A former executive director at the Venezuelan state-owned oil company, PetrÃ©leos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA), pleaded guilty today for his role
in a billion-dollar international scheme to launder funds embezzled from PDVSA.

Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Ariana Fajardo Orshan of the
Southern District of Florida and Special Agent in Charge Mark Selby of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcementâs Homeland Security
Investigations (HSI) Miami Field Office made the announcement.

Abraham Edgardo Ortega, 51, a Venezuelan national, who was PDVSAâs executive director of financial planning, pleaded guilty to one count of
conspiracy to commit money laundering. He is scheduled to be sentenced on Jan. 9, 2019 by U.S. District Judge Kathleen M. Williams of the
Southern District of Florida, who accepted his plea today.

As part of his plea, Ortega admitted that in his position with PDVSA, he accepted $5 million in bribes to give priority loan status to a French
company and a Russian bank, which were both minority shareholders in joint ventures with PDVSA. Ortega was paid for this bribery scheme
with the proceeds of a currency exchange scheme, through which $1.2 billion was embezzled, through bribery and fraud from PDVSA. Ortega
also admitted that in his position with PDVSA, he accepted $12 million in bribes for his participation in a PDVSA embezzlement scheme involving
a loan and foreign-exchange contract.

Ortega admitted that he worked with a co-defendant to launder $12 million that he received as bribe payments. Ortega admitted that he and
his co-defendant laundered $12 million through a sophisticated false-investment scheme that received money from a payment made to look
like an investment into a fund, but, in fact, the payment was actually laundered out of the fund. Surrounding and supporting this false-
investment laundering scheme were complicit money managers, brokerage firms, banks and real estate investment firms in the United States
and elsewhere, operating as a network of professional money launderers, Ortega admitted.

Ortegaâs co-conspirators indicted on Aug. 16 include former PDVSA officials, professional third-party money launderers and members of the
Venezuelan elite, sometimes known as âboliburguÃ©s.â

An indictment is merely an allegation and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of
law.

PROBABLECAUSE Â© |

16. In 2016, a Confidential Source (CS) approached the HSI Miami Office (HSI-
Miami) regarding 78 million in Euros the CS received, which originated from a loan contract with
PDVSA. The CS was involved in a money laundeting conspiracy and wanted to surrender the
money and cooperate. HSI-Miami thereafter began an undercover investigation: Organized Crime
and Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF) Operation Money Flight.

17. TheCs agreed to, wear a recording device and Operation Money Flight proceeded
proactively with an initial focus on the defendantsâ efforts to launder a portion of the 78 million in
Euros (the âPDVSA firhdsâ) in and through South Florida.

18. âTwo years and over one hundred recordings later, Operation Money Flight revealed
an international conspiracy to launder the PDVSA funds through Miami and several large-scale,
international third-party money-laundering organizations. More specifically, the investigation

revealed the use of Miami real estate and sophisticated false-investment schemes to: launder

hundreds of millions of U.S. Dollars.
Case TTe-cm20085-KMW BDocurrent3 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/24/2018 Page 6 of 35

Venezuelan Corruption & Miami Laundering
19. Venezuela has a foreign-currency exchange system under which the government
âwill exchange local currency (Bolivars) at a fixed rate for U.S. Dollars. The fixed exchange rate
has been well below the true economic rate by a substantial factor for several years. For example,
in 2014, the Venezuelan government fixed exchange rate was approximately six Bolivars to one
U.S. Dollar. By contrast, the true economic exchange rate was approximately sixty Bolivars to one
U.S. Dollar. Y

20. The difference betweenâ the fixed rate and the true economic rate creates
opportunity for fraud and abuse. c

21. For example, in 2014, an individual could exchange 10 million U.S. Dollars
for 600 million Bolivars at the true economic rate. Then, if that individual had access to the
government fixed rate, he could convert that sameâ600 million Bolivars into 100 million U.S.
Dollars. Essentially, in two transactions, thatâperson could buy 100 million U.S. Dollars for 10
million U.S. Dollars. â

22. Massive fraud and corruption is rampant throughout Venezuelaâs government-run
foreign-exchange system. Estimates of the fraud range as high as $20 billion a year, and reports
indicate that corrupt government officials take kickbacks to authorize exchanges at the fixed
rate. Z

23. Embezzlement of Venezuelaâs dwindling foreign currency reserves is the fuel for

these corrupt exchange schemes. PDVSA is Venezuelaâs primary source of income and foreign

currency (namely, U.S. Dollars and Euros), and serves as the source of foreign currency used to

fund corrupt foreign exchange embezzlement schemes. As with Venezuela in general, fraud and
corruption is reportedly common at PDVSA.

24. Venezuelaâs state of social, political, and economic crisis in which multi-billion-
Dollar corrupt and criminal ecosystems thrive drives rivers of criminal proceeds through South
Florida, which has become an international money-laundering hub and a desirable destination for
well-to-do foreign criminals and kleptocrats.

False-Investment Money Laundering van

25. Most of the defendants are sophisticated operators with respect to the international
banking system and are aware of banksâ general due diligence and anti-money laundering
practices, including know-your-customer (K YC) requirements: .

26. Importantly, for one party to wire funds to a third party, there must be some
legitimate business justification provided to the bank: for instance, a payment for the purchase of
real estate or equipment. Moreover, a bank will ask for documents supporting the justification,
whichâdepending on the transactionâCan be difficult to manufacture; for instance, a bank may
be able to verify whether a supposed real estate transaction took place. This verification poses a
problem for money laundering transactions in which large sums of criminal proceeds must be
moved around the finaficial system from one person to another as bribes, kickbacks, transfers, or
exorbitant expenditures, for instance.

27. Accordingly, false investments in fake securities are convenient justifications in
that they are more difficult for a bank to investigate and verify. By way of example, one party
might wire 30 million U.S. Dollars to a third party with the justification that the amount is a loan

to the third party, supported by a 30 million U.S. Dollar promissory note due at some point in the

future, which neither party actually intends to honor. For the bank, ascertaining the true intent of
the parties and the fraudulent nature of the investment is difficult.

28. Sophisticated false-investment money laundering schemes are used throughout this
conspiracy, ranging from individual false securities (promissory notes and bonds) to entire false-
investment funds, which can be subscribed to as needed to justify transactions.

29. Surrounding and supporting these false-investment laundering schemes are
complicit money managers, brokerage firms, banks, and real estate investment firms in the United
States and elsewhere, operating as a network of professional money launderers.

Money Laundering Conspiracy .

30. The conspiracy in this case began in December 2014 with a currency exchange
scheme to embezzle approximately 600 million US. Dollars from PDVSA, obtained through
bribery and fraud, and the defendantsâ efforts to use the CS to launder a portion of the proceeds of
that scheme (the PDVSA funds). By May of*2015, the conspiracy had doubled in amount to 1.2
billion U.S. Dollars embezzled from PDVSA.

31. The facts of the âconspiracy set forth below are evidenced by electronic
communications and docunients, government records, financial records, recordings of phone
conversations and in-pÃ©rson meetings, and CS statements.

4 CONVIT & URDANETA Approach the CS

32. In 2014, URDANETA and CONVIT approached the CS with an offer to sell 100

million U.S. Dollars at a favorable Bolivar exchange rate and without the CS having to front the

Bolivars.
Case iTe-cr20085-KMW DBooumentS Entered on FLSD Docket 07/24/2018 Page 9 af 3s

33. | The CS agreed because the CS had clients in Venezuela to whom the CS could sell
the U.S. Dollars. From previous business dealings, the CS knew CONVIT obtained U.S. Dollars
from exchange contracts with PDVSA. |

34. |The CS expected to receive a simple buyer-seller foreign exchange (âforexâ)
contract to memorialize the agreement with CONVIT and URDANETA.

35. Over the course of the next month, January 2015, CONVIT, URDANETA, and the
CS continued to discuss and facilitate the supposed forex transaction, often via BlackBerry
Messenger (BBM) chats and while CONVIT was present in the Southern District of Florida,
according to U.S. travel and other records.â <

36. During this time, CONVIT delayed providing the forex contract to the CS, but this' ~
did not overly concern the CS because the funds were coming from a regulated asset management
firm, âEuropean Financial Institution 1,â which the Ã©s could explain to the receiving bank.

37. | The CS instructed CONVIT toâwire the funds from European Financial Institution
1 to an account belonging to a trust, of which the CS was the ultimate beneficiary. CONVIT agreed
and informed the CS that the funds âwould arrive in Euros and not U.S. Dollars.

38. By February, 12, 2015, the CS had received approximately 78.8 million Euros into
the trust from Europeari Financial Institution 1 in four separate wire transfers beginning on January
14, 2015. 4

39. After receiving the initial 36 million Euros in mid-January, the CS asked CONVIT

via BBM chat on January 13, 2015 if the CS could sell about 20 million Euros to a client, but

CONVIT replied âno.â CONVIT explained that he had already paid for the Bolivars on his end

 

* According to these records, CONVIT arrived in the Southern âDistrict of Florida on December
20, 2014 and departed on January 18, 2015.
Case [:bS-cr-20685-KMW Document friterecd on FLSD Docket 7/24/2018 Page LO of 33

(meaning he had no immediate need for Bolivars), and that the CS would have to wait about a
month to sell the Euros further.

40. On February 6, 2015, the CS informed CONVIT that the CS urgently needed the
forex contract between the CS and European Financial Institution 1 for the CSâs bankâs compliance
department. The CS asked CONVIT for a form draft so that the CS could prepare it.

41. That same day, CONVIT finally sent the CS a (PDF) document to justify the
transfer between European Financial Institution 1 and the CSâs trust. What CONVIT sent,
however, was a false joint venture contract between a Hong Kong shell company, Eaton Global
Services Limited, and the CSâs trust, with a forged signature on behalf of the CSâs trustee. The CS
had never seen this contract before.

42. The fake joint venture contract, dated December 17, 2014, contemplated a fictitious ;
600 million U.S. Dollar joint venture between Eaton Global and the CSâs trust; the supposed
business of the joint venture was the making of loans to PDVSA:

43, On February 9, 2015, the CS told CONVIT that the fake joint venture contract could
not be used. CONVIT and URDANETA assured the CS that the fake contract had not been used

)
or provided to any bank.

y

44. The CSâalso requested the original underlying exchange contracts and CONVIT
responded that URDANETA had physical copies and would deliver them. Days later in Venezuela,
the CS received the documents in-person from URDANETA, who explained that he obtained the
documents from âCONSPIRATOR 1,â a former PDVSA official.

45. These documents, which the CS provided to HSI-Miami, reveal the source of the

PDVSA funds and the nature of the scheme.
Case [:ES-cr-20685-KMW Document friterecd on FLSD Docket O7/24/2018 Page Li of 33

PDVSA Bribery & Embezzlement Scheme Revealed
46. Thesource of the PDVSA funds was a PDVSA foreign-currency exchange scheme
benefitting Eaton Global. The exchange scheme was disguised as a âfinancingâ arrangement using
the following three documents (provided by URDANETA) in an artless attempt to hide what was
ultimately revealed as an embezzlement:
a. First, a loan contract, dated December 17, 2014, between PDVSA
. and Rantor Capital C.A., a Venezuelan shell company, in which Rantorâagreed to
loan 7.2 billion Bolivars to PDVSA. The loan contract was executed by
âVENEZUELAN OFFICIAL 1â as Vice President of PDVSA;
b. Second, an assignment contract, dated December 23, 2014, between
Rantor and Eaton Global, in which Rantor assigns its rights as PDVSAâs creditor
under the loan contract to Eaton Global and in which it is contemplated that PDVSA
is given the right to cancel the debt within 180 days by paying 600 million U.S.
Dollars; and <
C. Third, a notice of assignment letter, dated December 23, 2014, in
which Eaton Global informs PDVSA (VENEZUELAN OFFICIAL 1) of the
assignment andâ suggests that PDVSA repay the 7.2 billion Bolivar loan in the Euro
equivalent of 600 million U.S. Dollars. The letter included instructions for PDVSA
to wire the funds to European Financial Institution 1 accounts for the benefit of
Eaton Global. |
47. In short, Eaton Global ended up with the right to pay PDVSA about 7.2 billion
Bolivars (worth around 35 million Euros) and receive about 510 million Euros, of which about

78.8 million Euros was sent to the CS.
Case iis-cr-20685-KMW Document Entered on FLSO Docket 07/24/2018 Page 12 of 33

48. While the CS continued to wait for a forex contract from CONVIT and
URDANETA, the CS began to conduct third-party transactions on their and CONSPIRATOR 1âs
behalf. Ultimately, the CS learned that the CS was not involved in a forex transaction, but rather a
money laundering operation in which the CS was expected to launder the proceeds of the
embezzlement and make cash kickback payments to VENEZUELAN OFFICIAL 1.

49. In April 2015, the CS began making cash payments in Venezuela at URDANETA
and CONSPIRATOR 1âs direction, including to URDANETA, CONSPIRATOR 1, and
VENEZUELAN OFFICIAL 1, which would ultimately total over 1 million U.S. Dollars.

50. In all, the CS conducted approximately 15 million Euros-worth of transactions
through the summer of 2015, including several U.S.-Dollar wire transactions at the defendantsâ
direction,â until the CS began to resist making further payments. Around that time, the CS used
the liquidation of the CSâs trustee as an excuse to halt payments: the CS claimed that the CS could
not continue without the forex contract. CONVIT and URDANETA continued to pressure the CS.
The ensuing impasse led to a meeting around November 2015 at CONVITâs office in Venezuela,

51. Around November 5015 , CONVIT summoned the CS to a meeting at CONVITâs
office in Caracas, Venezuela. Prior to the meeting, CONVIT explained to the CS that the CS would
meet AMPARAN, who was in charge of the financial documents.

52. At the meeting, CONVIT, URDANETA, AMPARAN, and the CS sat around a
table. CONVIT had a handgun on the table. Next to CONVIT was a German Shepard with a shock

collar. CONVIT held the remote for the collar, and commented that he could not always control

the dog. The meeting took place at CONVITâs office with numerous security guards; according to
the CS, the mood was one of intimidation by CONVIT.

53. | AMPARAN told the CS that the fake joint venture contract -had in fact been
provided to European Financial Institution 1âs banks in Canada and Malta. Accordingly,
AMPARAN explained that it would be impossible to replace the contract with a simple forex
contract and additional fake contracts were needed. The CS asked to return the PDVSA funds and
reverse the transactions, but was told a reversal was impossible. L

The CS Records the Defendants

54. Beginning in February 2016, the CS recorded conveisations with the defendants
and other conspirators in which they explicitly acknowledgedâ the money laundering conspiracy
and underlying embezzlement. As evidence by the following recordings, during this time, the cs
worked with URDANETA, ORTEGA, and CONSPIRATOR 1 to account for and distribute the
PDVSA funds to themselves and others andâto ensure that AMPARAN supplied the additional
fake contracts necessary to do so. |
55. In a-February 19, 2016 recorded meet with URDANETA, the CS complained that
the CS needed additional documents from AMPARAN. URDANETA agreed and said that he
would write to AMPARAN, CONVIT and âCONSPIRATOR 2â to âbug themâ about the
contracts. URDANETA also stated that they (CONVIT, et al.) are being âhit right nowâ by people
in the âassemblyâ and joked that it is not a âpifiata,â in an apparent reference to corrupt Venezuelan
officials hitting the defendants up for bribes. URDANETA also stated that he would not go to the

United States because the last time he was searched at the border and âthey took away [his] phone.

[And t]hank God [he] didnât have [his] phone, but a new phone.â

11
Case iiS-cr-20685-KMW Document 3S Entereci on FLSO Docket O7/24/2018 Page 14 of 83

56. In a February 22, 2016 recorded meet with ORTEGA, ORTEGA and the CS
discussed how to move ORTEGAâs money from the CS to ORTEGA. The CS explained that it is
not simple, and ORTEGA, regarding the source of his portion of the PDVSA funds, stated:

So we can be frank and open with each other. Now. You know the origin of that.

And that comes from... from something that is still making noise and itâs still

making noise and itâs still making noise. Itâs going to explode one day. [ mean,

maybe not tomorrow, and also, itâs not the... our friend, the leader in all this, he is
everywhere every day

ORTEGA also acknowledged CONSPIRATOR 1âs"" role in assigning him a portion of the PDVSA
funds and fretted aloud:

Itâs all that shit theyâve been talking about, investigatioris and shit. Or the
Americans going into all this, is that tue? How far does that reach?

But, how far could they get, in your opinion? If they get to the Swiss and they tell
them, âI want, I want this information.â Do they have to give it to them?

Finally, the CS and ORTEGA walked through somÃ© account opening forms and discussed how
ORTEGA could avoid declaring himself as a politically exposed person (also known as a PEP) on
bank KYC documents. a

57. In a February 23; 2016 recorded conversation with âCONSPIRATOR 3â
(CONSPIRATOR 1âs brother the CS explained that the CSâs trustee is liquidating and
âeventually thereâs a risk of the trustee checking the operationâ and finding that the âthe guys did
a fake deal, falsifying the signatures of these guys who are there.â The CS explained that the CS â
called URDANETA and CONSPIRATOR | and told them that they have to set the documentation
straight. The CS and CONSPIRATOR 3 also discussed a meeting in Caracas between the CS,
URDANETA, and AMPARAN about fixing the document, and CONSPIRATOR 3 noted that he

has a âpayment for [VENEZUELAN OFFICIAL 1].â

 

4 CONSPIRATOR 1 is a former PDVSA official.

12
Case BAB Cr 20685-R VW . Document S Entered on FLOD Docket O7/24/2018 Page 15 of 33

58. In a March 7, 2016 recorded meet with URDANETA, the CS and URDANETA
recounted the receipt and expenditure of the PDVSA funds to date (âseventy eight million eight
hundred and somethingâ). They recounted how much belonged to CONSPIRATOR 1 (âfourteen
million five hundred forty thousand six hundred twenty-fiveâ) and other expenditures, including a
list of cash payments to include payments to VENEZUELAN OFFICIAL 1 who authorized the
underlying PDVSA loan agreement. The CS recounted the cash kickbacks to VENEZUELAN
OFFICIAL 1 as follows: | 7 |

[VENEZUELAN OFFICIAL 1], I gave him... to the boy he sent-in one occasion

two hundred thousand [200,000], June fourth [4'*] and in another occasion one
hundred thousand [100,000], on June twenty sixth [26""). .

URDANETA agreed. URDANETA and the CS then discussed AMPARANâs plan to make new

| fake contracts justifying the transaction (the CS noted to URDANETA that AMPARAN is flying
to Miami in several days). URDANETA was conÃ©Ã©med that he didnât want to leave a trail of
âbreadcrumbsâ with respect to the accounts. URDANETA again acknowledged CONVITâs
involvement and CONSPIRATOR 1âs arrangement with ORTEGA. CONSPIRATOR 1 joined the
meeting and discussed with URDANETA and the CS the fake joint venture contract, who was
responsible for it, and how âto divide up the PDVSA funds.

59. Importantly, at this meeting, URDANETA and CONSPIRATOR 1 reviewed a
spreadsheet of all the cash payments and expenditures created by the CS; each acknowledged the
contents of the document, wrote notes on it, checked off transactions, and, ultimately, dated it. The
CS provided a copy of this document to HSI-Miami with both URDANETA and CONSPIRATOR
1âs handwritten notes ; included on the spreadsheet are the kickback payments to VENEZUELAN
OFFICIAL 1. |

60. In a March 9, 20 16 recorded meet with AMPARAN and URDANETA,

AMPARAN ran through the plan to replace the fake joint venture agreement with new documents.

s

AMPARAN explained that the fake agreement could be replaced with the new (better) fake ones
in the compliance file at the Canadian bank and added to the file at European Financial Institution
1, and further that the âAccounting Firm 1â auditors are on board. AMPARAN explained that he
is flying to Miami the next day and from there he will print out and provide the CS with the new
fake contracts.

61. In a March 15, 2016 recorded meet with ORTEGA, ORTEGA explained to the CS
that he has found a âpersonâ (GUSTAVO) with a âstructureâ to transfer his PDVSA funds to
ORTEGA, and asks the CS to meet with the person in New York, Miami; or Panama. ORTEGA
asked the CS what the CSâs story is and why the CS is acting differently âovernightâ and whether
it is âan investigationâ; the CS explained that everyone is âmaking messes,â that the CS has
âstart[ed] to find out about stuff... the [CS] didnâ t know,â and that the CSi 1S stopping because the
CS doesnât want to get into trouble. ORTEGA explaiced that the rumor is that the âAmericans are
investigating you, that you are in big troubleâ and asked the CS whether the CS is under
investigation and what the banks have asked the CS.

62. In an April 2, 2016 recorded meet with ORTEGA and GUSTAVO in Panama,
ORTEGA introduced the CS to GUSTAVO, who explained how he can launder money using his
brokerage firm and private mutual fund. Specifically, GUSTAVO explained that his brokerage
firm, GSA, operates from the United States, but primarily does business in Latin America and
manages $2 billion.* Regarding GSAâs reputation, GUSTAVO explained:

I would say that our profile, would be by-by nature a business that we prioritized

the type of client with which we deal, uh...letâs say if it is a low profile, we go even
, D

 

> I am further aware, that GSA is affiliated with Global Strategic Investments, LLC (GSI), which
is a broker/dealer headquartered in Miami, Florida. GUSTAVO and the CS would later conduct
numerous meetings at GSIâs office in Miami.

lower, that way they will never talk about us, or any advertising, or any cocktail
parties.

GUSTAVO explained that they operate a fake mutual fund which receives money from a payment
made to look like an investment into the fund, but is actually laundered out of the fund. GUSTAVO
explained that âweâll make the transactions in such a way that the purchase will look legitimateâ
and that the money can be directed anywhere on the back-end using âcardsâ or âchecksâ or even
âwire transfers,â but as to the latter he (GUSTAVO) will âalways be on the lookout to see the
transfer and whoâs receiving it, because...[l]ike the saying goes, the fish dies by its mouth. ...they
have their eyes on everyone.â GUSTAVO went on to explain how he ean avoid being tracked by
the authorities such as Interpol and acknowledged that ORTEGA and the CSâs situation is a âtime
bomb.â Finally, GUSTAVO insisted that they use WhatsApp to communicate and avoid emails.Â®
Cooperation Begins & Conspiracy Continues in Miami

63. In April 2016, the CS began cooperating with HSI-Miami and continued making
consensual recordings with the defendants and other conspirators.

64. The conspiracy continued in four primary aspects. First, AMPARAN worked to
replace the fake joint venture contact with better fake contracts to justify the initial transfers to the
CS. Second, AMPARAN worked to launder URDANETAâs portion of the PDVSA funds. from
the CS using false investments. Third, GUSTAVO worked to launder ORTEGAâs portion of the
PDVSA funds fom the CS, also using false investments. And fourth, KRULL and GUSTAVO

worked to launder additional PDVSA funds that did not originally flow through the CS.

 

6 Based on my training and experience, encrypted peer-to-peer chat services, such as WhatsApp,
are preferred by individuals engaged in criminal activity because law enforcement is generally
unable to obtain the content of the communications from the service provider.

15
Case 1: bS-cr-20685-K MW Document 3S friterecd on FLSD Docket O7/24/2018 Page 18 of 33

65. During the course of this conspiracy, GUSTAVO also laundered funds as part of a
scheme to promote international narcotics trafficking. KRULL also contacted the CS with several
separate plans to launder money from at least one foreign bribery scheme, all as set forth below.

AMPARANâs Replacement of the Fake Joint Venture Contract

66. Ina recorded April 27, 2016 meet with AMPARAN at the Miami, Florida office of
Solar Cargo, Inc.,7 AMPARAN and the CS discussed the fake joint venture contract and
AMPARAN acknowledged that it was meant to justify the movement of the PDVSA funds to the
cs and that CONVIT was involved. AMPARAN assured the CS not toâworry about European
Financial Institution 1 and the fake contract because European FinanÃ©ial Institution 1 will let him
know if there is an investigation and AMPARAN âcan manipulate that.â AMPARAN and the CS
discussed supplemental fake contracts AMPARAN had previously prepared and provided.
AMPARAN also began to explain how he will lander URDANETAâs portion of the PDVSA
funds using fake bonds. â

67. On or around May 26,: 5016, the CS received a BBM chat from AMPARAN
instructing him where in Venezuela to pick up the proposed fake contracts. The CS had an assistant
pick up the replacement fake contracts from AMPARAN and provided them to HSI-Miami.

68. On May 25, 2016, URDANETA sent a BBM chat to the CS stating that
âT*âCONSPIRATOR 4%] ... has an offer and I prefer you to speak directly with him.â On May 27,

2016, the CS had a recorded call with CONSPIRATOR 4, and explained to CONSPIRATOR 4

that the CS was working with AMPARAN to fix things and that the CS had explained to the bank '

 

7 AMPARAN explained in the recorded meet that he works for Solar Cargo, that it has six planes
operating, and that he had recently been hired by PDVSA to move medicine from Iran to
Venezuela.

8 CONSPIRATOR 4 is associated with CONVIT and formerly with PDVSA .

16
Case [:bS-cr-20685-K MW Document frierecd on FLSD Docket 7/24/2018 Page 19 of 33

that the PDVSA funds were from an exchange transaction. CONSPIRATOR 4 responded âOh they
made it upâ and the following conversation ensued: |

CONSPIRATOR 4: This is bad. This is bad when not-not-not... The truth is not
L spoken and canât-canât-canât even do [unintelligible]
regarding it since it never happened.

CS: Uh-huh. But...the truth was a foreign exchange transaction,
correct?

CONSPIRATOR 4: The truth it was, was, was not a foreign exchange.
transaction. It does not exist in Bolivars. Not atall, it was
a payment [unintelligible]

CONSPIRATOR 4 suggested a meeting in Venezuela with everyone who has âan interestâ to sort
things out and fix âthe papersâ before things get bad when it is too-late.

69. On June 13, 2016, the CS met with AMPARAN in Venezuela and they executed
replacement fake contracts. The replacement fake contracts (later provided to HSI-Miami by the
CS) included a complex array of bogus financing and trust documents involving Rantor, the CSâs""
trust, and other entities.

70. On June 22, 2016, AMPARAN sent the CS an email with a fake loan agreement
between Solar Cargo and Rantot meant to supplement the replacement fake contracts. In BBM
chats between AMPARAN and the CS in August 2016, AMPARAN asked if the CS received the
latest contract, and the CS responded yes. On September 5, 2016, AMPARAN sent the final fake
contract between Solar Cargo and a company belonging to the CS. All of these replacement fake
contracts were backdated to early 2014.

AMPARAN and URDANETAâs Efforts to Continue Laundering PDVSA Funds

71. As mentioned above, in an April 27, 2016 recorded meet with AMPARAN in

Miami, the efforts to launder URDANETAâs portion of the PDVSA funds from the CS occurred

_ simultaneously to AMPARANâs efforts to replace or supplement the fake joint venture contract.

17
Case [:bS-cr-20685-KMW Document frierecd on FLSD Docket 7/24/2018 Page 20 of 33

During that meet, AMPARAN explained how he would launder URDANETAâs portion of the
PDVSA funds using the purchase of a fraudulent bond designed to default to conceal the transfer:

we are now working through a mechanism, through which, we issue a bond through
a bank, from which we have, eh, on which we have a lot of influence, or several
banks, but one in particular that is the one, we are working with right now, we issue
a bond. ... That you on that side would buy, you would make an investment in that
bond, we receive, um, that, eh, receive that money for the purchase of that bond
and you keep the bond on that side. In the term of, a number of months, that bond
starts going down in price, ... until there comes a moment when it flips, ... but the
account is never closed, nor, nor are funds transferred, the funds never leave, and
an investment is made. â4

72. In a May 12, 2016 recorded call with URDANETA, URDANETA and the CS
recounted the CSâs meeting with AMPARAN and the- defaulting-bond laundering plan.
URDANETA brought up an apartment âover thereâ in Miami for which he paid a significant

deposit that he is being pressured to close on in 60 days by the developer and agreed to send the

a
Lf

CS the notice from the developer.

2, URDANETA later sent the @S an image of a May 10, 2016 email from the
developer of the Porsche Design Tower in Miami, informing him of the upcoming closing on the
unit. The email included âPre Closing Questionnaireâ provided by the developer contains the
following warning: âNote: taking title under a company or trust may trigger FinCEN reporting
requirements.â In a follow up chat with the CS, URDANETA explained that he was worried about
the FinCEN reporting requirement and discussed ways to minimize the risk; URDANETA
suggested forming a new company with his wife as the beneficial owner.

74. In a May 17, 2016 recorded call with URDANETA, URDANETA discussed the

transfer of the Miami condominium with the equity of URDANETAâs down payment to

AMPARAN as a fee for AMPARANâs laundering services. And, ina May 18, 2016 recorded meet

18
Case [:ES-cr-20685-KMW Document friterecd on FLSD Docket O7/24/2018 Page 21 of 33

with AMPARAN at Solar Cargo in Miami, AMPARAN and the CS discussed using the Miami
condominium as a feeâ and moving forward with the defaulting-bond laundering plan. :

75. In a November 21, 2016 BBM chat, AMPARAN provided the details of an
additional fraudulent bond purchase to launder URDANETAâs PDVSA funds and explained that
the bond purchase will be facilitated through a U.K. broker dealer, âEuropean Financial Institution
2.â

76. In a March 1, 2017 recorded meet, the CS met with URDANETA, AMPARAN,
âCONSPIRATOR 5,â!â and GOIS, at the offices of European Company 1-in Madrid, Spain. Prior
to the meeting, URDANETA was captured on the recording explaining âto the CS that the CS:
should not be concerned about the fake joint venture contract-or being caught because they only
had to worry about the United States and the âAmericans ... have no jurisdictionâ; URDANETA
uses the word âlaunderâ to describe their activities. â

77. The purpose of the meeting was for the CS to gain comfort with the âoperationâ
proposed by AMPARAN. CONSPIRATOR 5 and GOIS were introduced as the managers of the
operation and meant to comfort the CS, who had relayed misgivings to URDANETA about
working with AMPARAN,, .

78. During'the meeting, GOIS asked if there is anything he can tell the CS to make him

more comfortable and the CS noted that he was concerned about European Financial Institution 2

â

 

Â°AMPARAN and URDANETA would later report that they worked out a solution to achieve the
transfer. Miami-Dade Property records show that the property was transferred from the developer
to Paladium Real Estate Group LLC on January 12, 2017. According to the Florida Department of
State, Paladium was formed on May 26, 2016 with URDANETAâs wife as an owner. On
September 23, 2016, AMPARANâs wife was added as a manager of Paladium, and on September
15, 2017, after the closing, URDANETAâs wife was removed, leaving AMPARAN in control of Â©
Paladium and the condominium.

because they asked âno questionâ and had âno objectionâ when an account was opened in the CSâs
name to purchase the fake bond. GOIS explained that there is no issue with European Financial
Institution 2, AMPARAN, GOIS, and CONSPIRATOR 5 went on to explain that they manage a
fund which allows them'foâ* generate payment structures, and third party payments institution, with
a very light KYC.ââ AMPARAN emphasized that they can make payments to âMiami, Panama,
Europeâ: the CS clarified, âAnd you have no issues paying in the United States?â, to which
AMPARAN replied, âNo.â GOIS explained that the CS should first buy a U.K. GILT, then
transfer it to an account in the CSâs name at European Financial Institution 2, after which it will
be swapped with the fake bond to begin the transfer to URDANETA.â |
~79. On April 26, 2017, the CS, at the request of GOIS and URDANETA, purchased a
5-million-pound U.K. GILT. On June 20, 2017, the CS, at the request of GOIS, ordered his bank,
to âfree deliverâ the GILT to an account opened for fhe CS at European Financial Institution 2. At
European Financial Institution 2, GOIS would oversee an operation to have the GILT exchanged
for a separate worthless bond, so the funds could ultimately be transferred to and concealed for
URDANETA. Thereafter, the patties continued to discuss the movement of the balance of
~ URDANETAâs portion of the PDVSA funds through 2018, though-no additional funds have been
moved to date. ra
80. Inâ a recorded December 11, 2017 meet with GOIS in the U.K., GOIS explained
how European Company 1 is the front supporting the laundering operation with the fake bond, and
that AMPARAN, CONSPIRATOR 5, and âCONSPIRATOR 6â!! are the directors. GOIS alsoâ ~

lamented their criminal exposure, and advised the CS as follows:

...the faster you get out, the better for you. Because if you... theyâre going to lock
us all up. That... Iâm telling you, [CS], what do you want me to tell you? That itâs

 

'l CONSPIRATOR 6 is a third-party money launderer.

not like that? Itâs the truth, thereâs going to be a day that they are going to lock all
of us up; they are going to lock us up. This will be known. [CS], I have no doubt.
I already saw where the shit comes from. I saw where it comes from, how theyâre
doing things, then in the end, whoever has the money is the one who is going to
have problems. The rest, well, he will have to defend himself, saying âLook, I got
paid here.â Youâll defend yourself in your own way, Iâll defend myself in the same
way. But that will happen

ORTEGA and GUSTAVOâs Efforts to Continue Laundering PDVSA Funds

81. Also beginning in April 2016, ORTEGA and GUSTAVO continued their efforts to
launder ORTEGAâs portion of the PDVSA funds through GUSTAVOâs fake mutual fund, which
culminated in the actual movement of funds about a year later. e |

82. In February 2017, the CS laundered some of ORTEGAâs portion of the PDVSA

âfunds with GUSTAVOâs fake mutual fund structure at ORTEGAâs direction. On February, 21,

2017, GUSTAVO emailed the CS subscription instructions and a subscription agreement for the
fake fund. Per these documents, the name of the find was Global Securities Trade Finance, aw
Cayman Islands entity, and the custodian bank was âUS Financial Institution 1â in New Jersey.
On February 24, 2017, the CS instructed 4 bank in the Bahamas (where a portion the PDVSA funds
were then held) to subscribe to the fund per the instructions in the amount of 5,000,0000 US.
Dollars. Thereafter, on or around February 28, 2017, that amount was wired to U.S. Financial
Institution 1; the fake subscription was obtained by the CS, and the 5,000,000 U.S. Dollars was
available for further use by ORTEGA.

83, In a March 29, 2017 recorded meet in Miami, Florida, the CS asked GUSTAVO
about U.S. Financial Institution 1 and GUSTAVO explained that the bank is controlled by his
partners in Uruguay, who also control another bank in Puerto Rico (âU.S. Financial Institution 2â)

and that they âhave our people in the backâ of the bank.

21
Case :bS-cr-20685-KMW Document friterecd on FLSD Docket O7/24/2018 Page 24 of 33

84. Innumerous BBM chats between the CS and ORTEGA, ORTEGA asks how things
are going with âGâ (GUSTAVO) and acknowledges the ongoing laundering of his (ORTEGAâs)
funds.

85. Later in April 2017, GUSTAVO, with ORTEGAâs agreement, laundered $400,000

. of the $5,000,000 back to the CS as the CSâs âfeeâ for the CSâs role in facilitating the laundering
of ORTEGAâs$5,000,000 to GUSTAVO. The CS provided GUSTAVO with an undercover (UC)
bank account in the name of a shell company in the Southern District of Floridato receive the fee.
On April 24, 2017, GUSTAVO wired $396,000 from U.S. Financial Institution 1 to the UC .
account. To âjustify,â i.e., conceal, the transaction, GUSTAVO created a fake loan contract
between the UC shell company and Global Securities Trade Finance.

86.  Thenext stage of this scheme was the laundering of the fake subscription out of the |
CSâs account and into an account ultimately benefiting ORTEGA in order to eliminate any final
trace of the movement. GUSTAVO and ORTEGA proposed several methods for this, which the
CS rejected. These efforts continue to this day. Over the course of the summer of 2017, however, .
GUSTAVO revealed his connections to yet another complicit US. financial institution, U.S.
Financial Institution 2, in an effort to launder the subscription.

87. In a rec6rded June 7, 2017 meet with GUSTAVO, GUSTAVO told the CS that he
works with U.S.Financial Institution 2, that he knows the owner, and that he can facilitate things:
âSure, and discreet. And the good thing about [U.S. Financial Institution 2] is that without being,
without being in U.S., it is in U.S....in Puerto Rico.â GUSTAVO later introduced the CS to
GUTIERREZ, the majority shareholder of U.S. Financial Institution 2, and the CS and

GUTIERREZ agreed to meet in the future.

22
 

88. On July 31, 2017, GUTIERREZ flew to Miami from Uruguay to meet with the CS. }
During a rÃ©corded meet on July 31, 2017 with GUTIERREZ in Miami, the CS explained td
GUTIERREZ that the CS needed to transfer GUSTAVOâs fund subscription to GUSTAVOâs
âclientâ (ORTEGA) with no trail. The CS and GUTIERREZ discussed options including internal
account-to-account transfers at U.S. Financial Institution 2.

89. In a recorded August 14, 2017 call with GUTIERREZ, GUTIERREZ and the CS
further discussed the subscription to GUSTAVOâs fund. GUTIERREZ offered possible schemes
to justify the transaction using U.S. Financial Institution 2 and agreÃ©d that U.S. Financial
Institution 2 will charge a two-and-a-half percent (2.5%) fee. c

90. During a recorded August 15, 2017 meet with GUSTAVO in Miami, Florida, the
CS complained to GUSTAVO about how explicit GUTIERREZ was regarding their criminal

| | c
activities because he seemed reckless, and the following conversation ensued as GUSTAVO
attempted to reassure the CS that GUTIERREZ did not know about the ORTEGA âkick-backsâ:
cs I mÃ©an, I didnât tell him, âLook, this Ortega
thing is a kick-back,â but I imagine that he
a ~ knows what it is, mean...
GUSTAVO No, no, I havenât told him anything at all, I
: mean, zero [0], zero [0], zero [0]. And I
a will never tell him anything because itâs not
necessary. I never say anything to these
4 people because you donât need to. There
_isnât, I mean... everything is done well.

91. ORTEGA ultimately rejected the U.S. Financial Institution 2 option because he

wanted to avoid the United States. The transfer of the subscription remains unresolved.
GUSTAVOâs Other Laundering Schemes
92. During the course of multiple meetings in Miami with the CS, GUSTAVO

attempted to develop a relationship with the CS as a potential feeder of additional criminal clients

23
Case DLd-cr-20685-KMW Document Erterec on FLSD Docket O7/24/2018 Page 26 of 33

in need of money laundering. Indeed, GUSTAVO would go on to encourage and develop
additional money laundering schemes with the CS, touting his connections at multiple U.S.
financial institutions along the way, including other broker/dealers, in addition to U.S. Financial
Institutions 1 & 2.

93. In a November 8, 2016 recorded meet in Miami, the CS conducted a sting against
GUSTAVO, informing GUSTAVO about a âclientâ who had to buy a plane in Brazil that is âdoing
a delicate jobâ and is âgoing to move ... sensitive merchandise.â Prior to the cs proposing this
transaction, GUSTAVO assured the CS that the CS could speak franklyâas they were âbeyond
good and evil.â The CS explained that the client needed to pay someone in Spain for the plane,
but that the payment could not be traced back to the plane because âthere could be a risk ... the
authorities eventually investigate the plane.â GUSTAVO responded âokâ and âuh huhâ without
hesitation. The CS further explained that source money is in the United States and is completely
clean. GUSTAVO suggested some options and quickly agreed: âWeâll open an account right away
... and weâll make the paymentâ and tat they will justify receiving the payment by selling the
âclientâ a âproduct,â ie., a false investment. The CS and GUSTAVO agree to only charge the
âclientâ ten percent (30,000 U.S. Dollars) in the hopes that he will do more business with them.

94. Thereafter, GUSTAVO and the CS discussed the logistics of the transfer on several

â occasions. In Jariuary 9, 2017 recorded meet, the CS explained to GUSTAVO that the CS was
worried about ORTEGA and the money they (Venezuelan kleptocrats) are moving more than the
CS was âwortied about the plane, the DEA.â GUSTAVO responded, âYes, yes.â

95. On January 10, 2017, the CS and GUSTAVO commenced the transaction. Upon

the CS receiving instructions from GUSTAVO, HSI-Miami wired 300,000 U.S. Dollars from a

UC account in the Southern District of Florida to a U.S. Wells Fargo account held by Global

24
Case 1: bS-cr-20685-KMW Document friterecd on FLSD Docket O7/24/2018 Page 2? of 33

Securities Management LLC, and, on or around January 13, 2017, the funds were received in a
UC account in Spain as instructed. As previously agreed, GUSTAVO emailed the CS a fake
300,000 U.S. Dollar loan contract to support the initial transaction as well as an invoice from
Global Securities Management in the amount of 30,000 U.S. Dollars for âLoan Structuring.â
KRULLâs Conspires to Launder Additional PDVSA Funds with GUSTAVO

96. In October 2016, the CS met with KRULL in Panama. KRULL explained that he
was looking for a bank to deposit approximately 600,000,000 U.S. Dollars: from a currency
exchange with PDVSA on behalf of a client, âCONSPIRATOR 7,â!? and which the CS learned
were located in Gazprombank. The CS stated the CS could exploreâsome options but needed a
contract proving the source of funds. On November 8, 2016, KRULL explained that he had the
contract. In a November 17, 2016 WhatsApp chat, KRULL asked if the CS had âthe hushâ
(meaning hushmail, an encrypted email provider), and the CS provided a hushmail address. That
same day a PDVSA loan contract arrived at tle CSâs hushmail account.

97. | The PDVSA contract that the CS received from KRULL was an amendment to the
original contract between PDYSA âand Rantor, and doubled the credit line from 7.2 to 14 billion
Bolivars. The amendment ,was dated May 25, 2015, and specifically incorporated the initial
PDVSA loan contract.â

98. Over the course of the next few weeks, KRULL continued to press the issue over
WhatsApp chats, explaining his client was in a âhurry.â On November 30, 2016, the CS and
KRULL met again in Panama. Per the CS, KRULL explained that the funds came from exchange

contracts which generated around 1.2 billion U.S. Dollars. KRULL explained that, in addition to

 

2 CONSPIRATOR 7 is another reported billionaire member of the âboliburguÃ©sâ and owner of a
television network in Venezuela.

25
 

the 600-million-Dollar solution for CONSPIRATOR 7, KRULL needed an additional solution for
200 million U.S. Dollars held in European Financial Institution 1 in the name of a straw owner,
âCONSPIRATOR 8.â (The CS recognized CONSPIRATOR 8 as a straw owner previously
proposed to be used to conceal money for the stepsons of VENEZUELAN OFFICIAL 2, a.k.a,
âlos chamos,â during a prior meeting with the CONSPIRATOR 8, CONVIT, and âlos chamos.âââ)

99. On November 30, 2016, KRULL sent the CS a WhatsApp message with photos of
CONSPIRATORS 7 and 8âs Venezuelan passports. KRULL also forwarded an email to the CS
explaining the European Financial Institution 1 structure; the email was in fact a string of
previously forwarded emails attaching documents from Buropean Financial Institution 1, which
had been sent from AMPARAN to âCONSPIRATOR 9,â to CONSPIRATOR 7, to KRULL, and
to the CS. . |

100. In early December 2016, the CS infotmed KRULL of a solution for laundering the
additional PDVSA funds. The CS ultimately pfoposed GUSTAVO and his mutual-fund laundering
solution. On December 21, 2016, KRULL sent the CS a resume for CONSPIRATOR 8, whom
KRULL referred to as his âbuddy.* In a later recorded January 7, 2017 phone call with KRULL,
the CS explained that he could not use the CONSPIRATOR 8 resume, noting ââthis shit is a joke.â
KRULL agreed, âYesyitâs a joke.... I agree, I agree.â |

101. In a recorded January 9, 2017 meet with GUSTAVO in Miami, the cs asked
GUSTAVO for a solution similar to ORTEGAâs for CONSPIRATORS 7 & 8, and GUSTAVO -
immediately agreed. GUSTAVO noted that CONSPIRATOR 7 has one of the wealthiest fortunes
from the ââchavismo.ââ GUSTAVO walked through all the different laundering options for both and
how to handle any âK YCâ issues. KRULL later agreed to the solution presented by GUSTAVO,

and in BBM chats would acknowledge âGustavoâ when inquiring of the status. The CS and

26
 

KRULL and the CS and GUSTAVO had numerous recorded conversations and message chats
about the scheme over the course of months.

102. In a January 10, 2017 recorded. conversation, KRULL noted that
âTCONSPIRATOR 7]â is asking if the money can be sent. In another, on January 23, 2017,
KRULL said the money at European Financial Institution 1 is ready to be moved to
CONSPIRATOR 8 and thatââI met the dude, and also met the guy that represents him.â The CS
asked, âAre these the guyâs sons?â (meaning the stepsons of VENEZUELAN OFFICIAL 2), and
KRULL responded, âNah. Donât, donât, donât ask.â

103. Ina January 31, 2017 recorded call, the CS informed KRULL that he is in Miami
and both discuss the laundering further. KRULL acknowledged receiving money from the.
European Financial Institution 1 accounts before (i.e., other laundering activity) when he described
how the wires work. <

104. On March 7, 2017, KRULL sÃ©nt the CS a WhatsApp chat and explained that the
clients are asking about GUSTAVOâs fuitd being in the United States. In a March 7, 2017 recorded
call, KRULL advised that â[CONSPIRATOR 7|â is worried, and the CS explained that the fund
is not in the United States, but that GUSTAVO has offices in the United States (Miami and New
York). The CS explainÃ©d that GUSTAVO lives in Miami. KRULL asked if GUSTAVO can fly to
Panama, and the-CS assured KRULL he could.

105. âOn March 16, 2017, the CS met with KRULL and CONSPIRATOR 8 in Panama,
and at one point called GUSTAVO (who was not in Panama) to discuss the laundering operation.
During the meeting, CONSPIRATOR 8 stated that he ârepresented three persons.â After the
meeting, KRULL confided to the CS that he had once seen CONSPIRATOR 8 at CONSPIRATOR

7âs office having lunch with âlos chamos,â i.e., the stepsons of VENEZUELAN OFFICIAL 2.

-

106. Inarecorded April 5, 2017 call with KRULL, KRULL stated that CONSPIRATOR
8 was worried about wiring funds to purchase GUSTAVOâs fraudulent fund to U.S. Financial
Institution 1 in New Jersey because he was worried about using U.S. banks. KRULL explained
that he told CONSPIRATOR 8 it was irrelevant because all U.S. Dollar wire transactions travel
through correspondent banks in the United States regardless.

107. Ina recorded April 14, 2017 meet in Miami with KRULL, KRULL and the CS
discussed GUSTAVO and CONSPIRATOR 7 and the plan to launder the other PDVSA funds.

108. GUSTAVO and KRULL would continue to discuss this scheme with the CS for
months thereafter. For instance, in a recorded call with KRULL on August 2, 2017, the CS told
KRULL, âI am going to be with GUSTAVO tomorrow ... and heâs going to ask me about the fund
with the children.â KRULL explained that he is not sure, but that âCONSPIRATOR 7â may be
doing something on it with âChenteâ (AMPARAN) had explained that he (KRULL) speaks mostly
to â[CONSPIRATOR 8]â about it because heâis âthe client.â

109. Records obtained from erfail search warrants confirm the flow of the PDVSA funds
from PDVSA to the defendants and other conspirators through European Financial Institution 1.
For instance, a September 201 5 email circulated among AMPARAN and CONSPIRATORS 5 and:
6 with the subject lineââNumeros [CONSPIRATOR 7] includes an attachment titled âOperation
600k,â which contains the following work sheets:

a. A work sheet titled âDetailed Income from PDVSAâ shows ten
transfers from PDVSA from December 29, 2014 through February 3, 2015 totaling
511,913,270.74 Euros. .

b. A work sheet titled âSummary of the 600 Operationâ shows that, of

the 511 million Euros: 20,476,530.83 was assigned to European Financial

28
Case 1i8-cr-20885-KMW Document S Entered on FLSO Docket 07/24/2018 Page 31 of 33

Institution 1 as a 4% fee; 227,265,537.52 Euros went to the âBOLIâ (CONVIT andâ
CONSPIRATOR 2); 159,085,876.26 Euros went to âCHAMOSâ (the stepsons of
VENEZUELAN OFFICIAL 2); and 68,179,661.26 Euros went to CONSPIRATOR
7. The remaining 36,905 ,664.87 Euros was accounted for as the âCostâ of the initial
7.2 billion Bolivars used to obtain the 511 million Euros.
c. Further worksheets account for how each recipient moved the
money. The âBOLIâ for instance moved 78.8 million Euros to the CS and the
majority of the rest through apparent shell companies, Volbor Vontobel and
Vencon Holding. CONSPIRATOR 7 sent dozens of US, Dollar wires through
banks in Malta and Austria, including to aviation and yacht services as well as
brokerage companies in Miami, Florida.
These records not only exhibit the conspiracy in blint detail, but confirm the connection among
KRULL and the additional conspirators and the initial 78.8 million Euros in PDVSA funds
received by the CS. <
KRULLâs Additional V Venezuelan Laundering Schemes

110. Throughout,the course of KRULLâs scheme to launder the additional PDVSA
funds with the CS, KRULL presented other laundering schemes to the CS: One of the schemes
involved a relative of VENEZUELAN OFFICIAL 3 who needed a way to receive kickbacks from
foreign law firms who had been hired by the Government of Venezuela.

111. KRULL first approached the CS with this scheme in the summer of 2017 because

KRULL needed a laundering structure for receiving the kickbacks. Both KRULL and the CS

agreed that GUSTAVO was again a good laundering option.

29
Case :1S-cr-20685-KMW Document frierecd on FLSD Docket 7/24/2018 Pade 32 of 33

112. On June 29, 2017, KRULL called the CS and, in a recorded conversation, the CS
told KRULL that he is in Los Angeles, California. KRULL said he has to be âcandid and directâ
and stated:

Uh, Iâm sitting here with, with, with, with the [title of VENEZUELAN OFFICIAL

3]âs brother.... And, and, and well, they, they, they have earned in the last years a

payment theyâre going to receive that is for five [5]....Okay? And, and, and we

have been talking about the, the, the options they, they might have. Right? And,

and, and I donât know if, if, if you have something that you, that you might think
of, as to how it can be, uh, things can be structured. Right?

113. The CS noted that it may be difficult based on the recipient's piofile, but said they
can talk more tomorrow and explained he will be flying to Miami then. Ina later recorded call on
June 29, 2017, KRULL further specified that these were payments from law firms that had handled
international arbitrations on the Venezuelan governmentâs behalf with international companies and
had charged the government a lot of money (5,000,000 U.S. Dollars). In a recorded call the next
day, June 30, 2018, the CS, KRULL, and VENEZUELAN OFFICIAL 3âs brother discussed ways
to launder the payment which was again explicitly described as payments deriving from law firms
who represented Venezuelan government in arbitrations. Different options for laundering the
payments and âKYCâ requiremÃ©nts were discussed.

114. Ina recordÃ©d August 25, 2017 meet with GUSTAVO in Miami, the CS explained
that KRULL had two sjients related to VENEZUELAN OFFICIAL 3 who needed a way to launder
the payments they are going to receive from attorneys who were hired by the Venezuelan
government. The CS specifically stated âthe lawyers are giving them their. kick backsâ and
GUSTAVO responded, âMm-hmmm.â The CS then suggested that the lawyers themselves would
pay the kickback, and GUSTAVO immediately corrected him:

No, they canât pay these two [2] guys. No, thatâs impossible.... Just imagine.

Specially nowadays with OFAC, and with all of these people reviewing every
money transfer every day. .... Brother, thatâs kindergarten Algebra. Right? Well,

30
 

we will have to give a vehicle to each one of these guys...A private fund...The
same thing we did for [ORTEGA].

115. Inrecorded meetings on August 29, 2017 and November 14, 2017 with KRULL in
Miami, the CS and KRULL further discussed the kick-back laundering scheme.
CONCLUSION
116. Based on the foregoing, probable cause exists that the defendants conspired to
launder monetary instruments, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1956(h), and
did travel in and use facilities of interstate and foreign commerce to further the laundering

activities, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1952. y -

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Wednesday, July 25, 2018

Two Members of Billion-Dollar Venezuelan Money Laundering Scheme Arrested

Two alleged participants in a billion-dollar international scheme to launder funds embezzled from Venezuelan state-owned oil company PDVSA
using Miami, Florida real estate and sophisticated false-investment schemes were arrested yesterday and today.

Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Benjamin Greenberg of the
Southern District of Florida and Special Agent in Charge Mark Selby of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcementâs Homeland Security
Investigationsâ (HSI) Miami Field Office made the announcement.

Matthias Krull, 44, a German national and Panamanian resident, and Gustavo Adolfo Hernandez Frieri, 45, a Colombian national and naturalized
U.S. citizen, were charged in a criminal complaint with conspiracy to commit money laundering. The complaint also charged Francisco Convit
Guruceaga, 40; Jose Vincente Amparan Croquer, aka, âChente,â 44; Carmelo Urdaneta Aqui, 44; and Abraham Eduardo Ortega, 51, all
Venezuelan nationals; and Hugo Andre Ramalho Gois, 39, a Portuguese national, and Marcelo Federico Gutierrez Acosta y Lara, 40, a Uruguayan
national, for their alleged participation in the scheme. These defendants remain at large. Krull was arrested last night in Miami and had his
initial court appearance earlier today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Alicia M. Otazo-Reyes in Miami. Krull is scheduled to have a pre-trial
detention hearing on July 30, and a preliminary hearing on Aug. 8. Frieri was arrested today in Sicily, Italy and faces extradition proceedings.

According to the criminal complaint, the conspiracy in this case allegedly began in December 2014 with a currency exchange scheme that was
designed to embezzle around $600 million from PDVSA, obtained through bribery and fraud, and the defendantsâ efforts to launder a portion of
the proceeds of that scheme. By May 2015, the conspiracy had allegedly doubled in amount to $1.2 billion embezzled from PDVSA. PDVSA is
Venezuelaâs primary source of income and foreign currency (namely, U.S. Dollars and Euros).

The complaint alleges that surrounding and supporting these false-investment laundering schemes are complicit money managers, brokerage
firms, banks and real estate investment firms in the United States and elsewhere, operating as a network of professional money launderers.

The alleged conspirators include former PDVSA officials, professional third-party money launderers, and members of the Venezuelan elite,
sometimes known as âboliburguÃ©s.â

The charges contained in the complaint are merely allegations and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a
reasonable doubt in a court of law.

This case is the result of the ongoing efforts by the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF) âOperation Money Flight,â a
partnership between and among federal, state and local law enforcement agencies. The OCDETF mission is to identify, investigate and
prosecute high-level members of drug trafficking enterprises, bringing together the combined expertise and unique abilities of federal, state
and local law enforcement.

HSI Miami, HS! London, HSI Rome and HSI Madrid investigated this case. The case is being prosecuted by Assistant Chief David Johnson of the
Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Francisco R. Maderal of the Southern District of Floridaâs International Narcotics
and Money Laundering Section.

The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs provided substantial assistance in this matter and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the
National Crime Agency of the United Kingdom and Italian, Spanish and Maltese law enforcement authorities provided assistance. The Fraud
Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice Departmentâs FCPA

enforcement efforts can be found at www. justice. gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.

for the benefit of CLAUDIA PATRICIA DIAZ GUILLEN by making the payments to ADRIAN
JOSE VELASQUEZ FIGUEROA, the spouse of CLAUDIA PATRICIA DIAZ GUILLEN,

instead of to CLAUDIA PATRICIA DIAZ GUILLEN herself.

ADRIAN JOSE VELASQUEZ FIGUEROA, which RAUL GORRIN BELISARIO caused to
be paid via wire transfer from bank accounts in Switzerland and elsewhere to bank accounts in the
Southern District of Florida and elsewhere.

22. RAUL GORRIN BELISARIO caused his employees to maintain a spreadsheet
for the purpose of tracking certain of the bribe payments made to and for the benefit of Alejandro
Andrade Cedeno and CLAUDIA PATRICIA DIAZ GUILLEN, including payments made to
and through ADRIAN JOSE VELASQUEZ FIGUEROA for the benefit of CLAUDIA
PATRICIA DIAZ GUILLEN, and further caused his employees to email updated spreadsheets
to RAUL GORRIN BELISARIO, Alejandro Andrade Cedeno, and ADRIAN JOSE
VELASQUEZ FIGUEROA reflecting the changes as certain payments were made.

23. In furtherance of the illegal bribery scheme and in order to promote the illegal

bribery scheme, RAUL GORRIN BELISARIO continued to provide money and other things of

ny

Former Venezuelan National Treasurer and Her Spouse Charged in Connection with International
Bribery and Money Laundering Scheme

A former Venezuelan National Treasurer and her spouse were charged in a superseding indictment filed Tuesday for their alleged participation
in a previously indicted billion-dollar currency exchange and money laundering scheme. An alleged co-conspirator was previously charged in
the original indictment.

Claudia Patricia Diaz Guillen (Diaz), 47, and her spouse, Adrian Jose Velasquez Figueroa (Velasquez), 41, Venezuelan citizens who reside in
Madrid, Spain, were charged in a superseding indictment filed in the Southern District of Florida with one count of conspiracy to commit money
laundering and two counts of money laundering.

laundering counts. He is currently a fugitive residing in Venezuela.

The superseding indictment alleges that Gorrin paid millions of dollars in bribes to two former Venezuelan national treasurers, Alejandro
Andrade Cedeno (Andrade) and Diaz, and to Velasquez, for the benefit of Diaz, to corruptly secure the rights to conduct foreign currency
exchange transactions for the Venezuelan government at favorable rates. Gorrin wired money to and for the benefit of Andrade and Diaz,
including money for private jets, yachts, homes, champion horses, high-end watches, and a fashion line.

Andrade, 56, a Venezuelan citizen, was previously sentenced to 10 years in prison in November 2018 for his role in the conspiracy to commit
money laundering. As part of his guilty plea, Andrade admitted that he received over $1 billion in bribes from co-conspirator Gorrin and other
co-conspirators in exchange for using his position as Venezuelan national treasurer to select them to conduct currency exchange transactions at
favorable rates for the Venezuelan government.

An indictment is merely an allegation and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.

HSI Miami, HS! Houston, HS! Boston, FBI Miami, and the FDIC OIG are investigating this case. This case is being prosecuted by Assistant Chief
Vanessa Sisti and Trial Attorney Paul A. Hayden of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section, and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Kurt Lunkenheimer and

Nalina Sombuntham of the Southern District of Florida. The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs provided significant assistance in
this matter. The Policia Nacional (Spanish National Police) also provided significant assistance.

The Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice

Departmentâs FCPA enforcement efforts can be found at www. justice. gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.

The defendant Airbus SE (the âCompanyâ), pursuant to authority granted by the
Companyâs Board of Directors reflected in Attachment B, and the United States Department of
Justice, Criminal Division, Fraud Section (the âFraud Sectionâ), the United States Department of
Justice, National Security Division (âNSDâ), and the United States Attorneyâs Office for the
District of Columbia, Criminal Division (the âOfficeâ), enter into this deferred prosecution
agreement (the âAgreementâ).

Criminal Information and Acceptance of Responsibility

1, The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Fraud Section, NSD, and the
Office will file the attached two-count criminal Information (the âInformationâ) in the United
States District Court for the District of Columbia charging the Company with one count of
conspiracy to commit offenses against the United States, in violation of Title 18, United States
Code, Section 371, that is, to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act of 1977 (âFCPAâ), as amended, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-3; and one count
of conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States, in violation of Title 18, United States
Code, Section 371, that is, to violate the Arms Export Control Act (âAECAâ), 22 U.S.C. Â§ 2778
et seq., and its implementing regulations, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (âITARâ),

l

 
Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 2 of 104

22 C.F.R. Â§ 130.9, as well as a criminal forfeiture allegation. In so doing, the Company: (a)
knowingly waives its right to indictment on these charges, as well as all rights to a speedy trial
pursuant to the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, Title 18, United States Code,
Section 3161, and Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 48(b); and (b) knowingly waives any
objection with respect to venue to any charges by the United States arising out of the conduct
described in the Statement of Facts attached hereto as Attachment A (the âStatement of Factsâ)
and consents to the filing of the Information, as provided under the terms of the Agreement, in the
United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The Fraud Section, NSD, and the Office
agree to defer prosecution of the Company pursuant to the terms and conditions described below.

2. The Company admits, accepts and acknowledges that it is responsible under United
States law for the acts of its officers, directors, employees and agents as charged in the Information,
and as set forth in the attached Statement of Facts, and that the allegations described in the
Information and the facts described in the Statement of Facts are true and accurate. Should the
Fraud Section, NSD, or the Office pursue the prosecution that is deferred by the Agreement, the
Company stipulates to the admissibility of the attached Statement of Facts in evidence in any
proceeding by the Fraud Section, NSD, or the Office, including any trial, guilty plea or sentencing

proceeding, and will not contradict anything in the attached Statement of Facts at any such

proceeding.
Term of the Agreement
3, The Agreement is effective for a period beginning on the date on which the

Information is filed and ending three years from that date (the âTermâ). The Company agrees,
however, that, in the event the Fraud Section, NSD, and the Office determine, in their sole

discretion, that the Company has knowingly violated any provision of the Agreement or has failed

2

 
Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 3 of 104

to completely perform or fulfill each of the Companyâs obligations under the Agreement, an
extension or extensions of the Term may be imposed by the Fraud Section, NSD, and the Office,
in their sole discretion, for up to a total additional time period of one year, without prejudice to the
Fraud Sectionâs, NSDâs, and the Officeâs right to proceed as provided in Paragraphs 19â23 below.
Any extension of the Agreement extends all terms of the Agreement, including the terms of the
reporting requirement in Attachment D, for an equivalent period. Conversely, in the event the
Fraud Section, NSD, and the Office find, in their sole discretion, that there exists a change in
circumstances sufficient to eliminate the need for the reporting requirement in Attachment D, and
that the other provisions of the Agreement have been satisfied, the Agreement may be terminated
early. If the Court fails to grant its approval for exclusion of time under the Speedy Trial Act, 18
U.S.C. Â§ 3161(h)(2), all the provisions of the Agreement shall be deemed null and void, and the
Term shall be deemed to have not begun.
Relevant Considerations
4, The Fraud Section, NSD, and the Office enter into the Agreement based on the
individual facts and circumstances presented by this case and the Company, including:
The FCPA Case
a. the Company did not receive voluntary disclosure credit for disclosure of
âthe FCPA-related conduct because it disclosed the corruption-related conduct to the Fraud Section
and the Office after the corruption-related investigation being undertaken by the Serious Fraud
Office (âSFOâ) in the United Kingdom began and was made public, however, the Company did
disclose the conduct to the Fraud Section within a reasonably prompt time of becoming aware of

corruption-related conduct that might have a connection to the United States;

 
Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 4 of 104

b. the Company received full credit for its cooperation concerning the
investigation of the FCPA-related conduct: by, among other things, (i) gathering evidence and
performing forensic data collections in multiple jurisdictions; (ii) proactively identifying issues
and facts that would likely be of interest to the Fraud Section and the Office; and (iii) making
factual presentations to the Fraud Section and the Office;

c. the Company provided to the Fraud Section, NSD, and the Office all
relevant facts known to it, to the extent permitted under foreign law, including information about

in the misconduct, freezing payments to business partners and applying enhanced due diligence
procedures, hiring new legal and compliance leadership, providing additional compliance training

e. the Company has enhanced and has committed to continuing to enhance its
compliance program and internal controls, including by implementing heightened controls and
additional procedures and policies relating to third parties, conducting a global risk-assessment
and ongoing reviews of its compliance program, and ensuring that its compliance program satisfies
the minimum elements set forth in Attachment C to the Agreement (Corporate Compliance
Program); |

f. based on the Companyâs remediation and the state of its compliance
program, as well as the fact that the Company will separately be entering into a resolution with the
Parquet National Financier (âPNFâ) in France and will be subject to oversight by authorities in
France, including L'Agence Frangaise Anticorruption, and the Companyâs agreement to report to

4

 
Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 5 of 104

the Fraud Section, NSD, and the Office as set forth in Attachment D to the Agreement (Corporate

that conduct to the SFO resolution;

i. the Company is neither a U.S. issuer nor a domestic concern, and the
territorial jurisdiction over the corrupt conduct is limited; in addition, although the United Statesâ
interests. are significant enough to warrant a resolution, Franceâs and the United Kingdomâs
interests over the Companyâs corruption-related conduct, and jurisdictional bases for a resolution,
are significantly stronger, and thus the Fraud Section and the Office have deferred to France and
the United Kingdom to vindicate their respective interests as those countries deem appropriate,
and the Fraud Section and the Office have taken into account these countriesâ determination of the
appropriate resolution into all aspects of the U.S. resolution;

j. the nature and seriousness of the offense conduct, including the long
duration of the bribery scheme, the involvement of executives at high levels of the Company, and

the amount of bribe payments made to government officials;

k. the Company has agreed to continue to cooperate with the Fraud Section,

NSD, and the Office in any ongoing investigation as described in Paragraph 5 below; and

in Attachment C to the Agreement (Corporate Compliance Program);

 
Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 7 of 104

p. based on the Companyâs remediation and the state of its compliance
program, as well as the fact that the Company will separately be entering into a resolution with the
PNF and will be subject to oversight by authorities in France, an ITAR-related consent agreement
with the State Department with a Special Compliance Officer, and the Companyâs agreement to

relevant portions of (a) through (k) above, the Company received full cooperation and remediation
credit of 25 percent off the bottom of the applicable United States Sentencing Guidelines (ââUSSGâ
or âSentencing Guidelinesâ) fine range for the FCPA-related conduct. Regarding the ITAR-related
conduct, the financial penalties were calculated taking into consideration the relevant portions of

11

 
Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 12 of 104

d. Culpability Score. Based upon USSG Â§ 8C2.5, the culpability score is 8,
calculated as follows:

(a) Base Culpability Score 5
(b)(1) the organization had 5,000 or more employees and

an individual within high-level personnel of the
organization participated in, condoned, or was

(g)(2) Cooperation, Acceptance -2
TOTAL 8
e. Calculation of Fine Range:
Base Fine | $1,743,315,734
Multipliers 1.6(min) / 3.2(max)
Fine Range $2,789,305,174/
$5,578,610,348
8. The Fraud Section and the Office and the Company agree, based on the application

of the Sentencing Guidelines to the FCPA-related conduct, that the appropriate criminal fine for
the FCPA-related conduct is $2,091,978,881 (âTotal Criminal Corruption Penaltyâ). This reflects
a 25 percent discount off the bottom of the applicable Sentencing Guidelines fine range. For the
ITAR-related offense alleged in the Information, the Sentencing Guidelines fine range is not
applicable under USSG Â§ 8C2.1. NSD, the Office, and the Company agree that, based on the
relevant factors, including those set forth in and pursuant to Title 18, United States Code, Sections
3571(d) and 3572(a), and Title 22, United States Code, Section 2278(c), the appropriate fine for
the ITAR-related conduct is $237,736,390 (âTotal ITAR Penaltyââ) and that the Company will also
transfer to the United States, in a civil forfeiture action, its ownership interest in an identified bond
worth 50,000,000 Euros, which bond is traceable to the proceeds of the ITAR-related conduct. For

12

 
Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 13 of 104

the portion of the fine amount calculated pursuant to Title 18, United States Code, Sections
3571(d), the alternative fine provision, the penalty imposed reflects a discount of more than 50
percent off the amount that would otherwise be available under that provision. The Fraud Section,
NSD, the Office, and the Company agree that the appropriate total criminal penalty is
$2,329,715,271 (âTotal Criminal Penaltyâ) and the ITAR-related civil forfeiture will be the
additional transfer of an identified bond worth 50,000,000 Euros. The Fraud Section, NSD, the
Office and the Company further agree that the Company will pay a criminal monetary penalty to
the United States Treasury in the amount of $294,488,085 for the FCPA-related conduct and
$232,736,390 for the ITAR-related conduct, and the Company will transfer to the United States in
a civil forfeiture action, its ownership interest in an identified bond worth 50,000,000 Euros. The
payment of $527,224,475 and the transfer of the ownership interest of the identified bond worth
50,000,000 Euros will be made no later than ten (10) business days after the Agreement is fully
executed.

9, The Fraud Section, NSD, the Office and the Company further agree that the Fraud
Section, NSD and the Office will credit towards satisfaction of payment of the Total Criminal
Penalty the amount the Company pays to French authorities, pursuant to the Companyâs resolution
in France, up to a maximum of $1,797,490,796. The Fraud Section, NSD, the Office and the
Company further agree that the Fraud Section, NSD and the Office will credit towards satisfaction
of payment of the Total ITAR Penalty the amount the Company pays to the Department of State
in connection with fines associated with the ITAR Consent Agreement entered into between the
Company and DDTC, up to a maximum of $5,000,000. The Companyâs payment obligations to
the United States under the Agreement will be complete upon the Companyâs payment of
$527,224,475 and the transfer of the ownership interest of the identified bond of 50,000,000 Euros,

13

 
Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 14 of 104

so long as the Company pays an additional $5,000,000 to the United States in a manner consistent
with any payment schedule agreed to with the DDTC, and the Company pays the remaining
amount of the Total Criminal Penalty (i.e. $1,797,490,796) to authorities in France, in a manner
consistent with any payment schedule agreed to with the French authorities. Should any amount
of such payments pursuant to the ITAR Consent Agreement entered into between the Company
and DDTC or to the authorities in France not be made by the end of the Term, or be returned to
the Company or any affiliated entity for any reason, the remaining balance of the Total Criminal
Penalty will be paid to the United States Treasury.

10. The Fraud Section, NSD, the Office and the Company further agree that this fine is
appropriate given the facts and circumstances of this case, including the Relevant Considerations
outlined in Paragraph 4 above. The Total Criminal Penalty and the forfeiture are final and shall
not be refunded. Furthermore, nothing in the Agreement shall be deemed an agreement by the
Fraud Section, NSD, and the Office that $2,385,079,771 is the maximum penalty that may be
imposed in any future prosecution, and the Fraud Section, NSD, and the Office are not precluded
from arguing in any future prosecution that the Court should impose a higher fine, although the
Fraud Section, NSD, and the Office agree that under those circumstances, they will recommend to
the Court that any amount paid under the Agreement should be offset against any fine the Court
imposes as part of a future judgment relating to the conduct described in the Statement of Facts.
The Company acknowledges that no tax deduction may be sought in connection with the payment
of any part of the Total Criminal Penalty, including in France. The Company shall not seek or ~
accept directly or indirectly reimbursement or indemnification from any source with regard to the

fine amounts that the Company pays pursuant to the Agreement or any other amount that the

14

 
Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 15 of 104

Company pays pursuant to any other agreement entered into with an enforcement authority or
regulator concerning the facts set forth in the Statement of Facts.
Forfeiture Amount
11. As aresult of the conduct described in count two of the Information and Statement
of Facts, the Company agrees that its ownership interest in an identified bond worth 50,000,000
Euro will be forfeited to the United States (the âForfeiture Amountâ), pursuant to this Agreement.

a. The Company agrees that the facts contained in the Information and the Statement
of Facts establish that the Forfeiture Amount is subject to civil forfeiture to the United States
pursuant to Title 18, United States Code, Section 981(a)(1)(C), and that this Agreement, the
Information, and the Statement of Facts shall be attached and incorporated into a civil forfeiture
complaint (the âCivil Forfeiture Complaintâ), a copy of which is attached hereto as Attachment E.
The Company further agrees that the funds used to pay the Forfeiture Amount are derived from
proceeds traceable to ITAR violations.

b. The Company releases any and all claims it may have to the funds used to pay the
Forfeiture Amount.

C, By this agreement, the Company expressly waives any constitutional, statutory, or
other challenge to the forfeiture of the Forfeiture Amount, including that the forfeiture constitutes
an excessive fine or punishment, and consents to the forfeiture of the Forfeiture Amount to the
United States. The Company agrees that it will not file a claim or otherwise contest the forfeiture
of the Forfeiture Amount and will not assist or direct a third party in asserting any claim to the
Forfeiture Amount.

d. The Company agrees to execute any additional documents as necessary for the
United States to complete the forfeiture of the Forfeiture Amount, including any forms evidencing

15

 
_ Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 16 of 104

the Companyâs consent to forfeiture and waiver of timely notice. The Company also waives all
rights to service or notice of any documents filed to effect the forfeiture, and any objection to in
rem jurisdiction as to the Forfeiture Amount. The Company further agrees to the entry of a Final
Order of Forfeiture against the Forfeiture Amount.

â¬. The Company shall transfer the Forfeiture Amount and any associated transfer fees
to the United States within ten (10) business days of the execution of this Agreement (or as
otherwise directed by the Fraud Section, NSD, and the Office following such period). Such
payment shall be made pursuant to instructions provided by the Fraud Section, NSD, and the Office
in their sole discretion. If the Company fails to timely make the transfer required under this
paragraph, interest (at the rate specified in Title 28, United States Code, Section 1961) shall accrue
~ onthe unpaid balance through the date of payment, unless the Fraud Section, NSD, and the Office,
in their sole discretion, choose to reinstate prosecution pursuant to Paragraphs 19 through 23
below. The Company certifies that the Forfeiture Amount is not the subject of any lien, security
agreement, or other encumbrance. Transferring encumbered property or failing to pass clean title
in any way will be considered a breach of the Agreement.

f. The Company agrees that the Forfeiture Amount shall be treated as a penalty to be
paid to the United States government for all purposes, including all tax purposes. The Company
agrees that it will not claim, assert, or apply for a tax deduction or tax credit with regard to any
federal, state, local, or foreign tax for any forfeiture paid pursuant to this Agreement.

g. The Forfeiture Amount paid is final and shall not be refunded should the Fraud
Section, NSD, and the Office later determine that the Company has breached this Agreement and
commence a prosecution against the Company. In the event of a breach of this Agreement and

subsequent prosecution, the Fraud Section, NSD, and the Office may pursue additional civil and

16

 
Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 17 of 104

criminal forfeiture in excess of the Forfeiture Amount. The Fraud Section, NSD, and the Office
agree that in the event of a subsequent breach and prosecution relating to the conduct set forth in
the Statement of Fact, it will recommend to the Court that the amounts paid pursuant to this
Agreement be offset against whatever fine or forfeiture the Court shall impose as part of its
judgment. The Company understands that such a recommendation will not be binding on the
Court.

Conditional Release from Liability

12. Subject to Paragraphs 19-23, the Fraud Section, NSD, and the Office agree, except
as provided in the Agreement, that they will not bring any criminal case against the Company or
its direct and indirect subsidiaries or its majority-owned joint ventures relating to any of the
conduct described in the Statement of Facts or the criminal Information filed pursuant to the
Agreement. Additionally, NSD and the Office agree that they will not prosecute the Company,
including its corporate subsidiaries and majority-owned joint ventures under 22 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 126.1,
129, 130, and corresponding regulations related to the retention of records relevant to those
provisions for conduct related to the Companyâs historical use of business partners between
December |, 2011, and continuing through on or about December 1, 2016.

13. The Fraud Section, NSD, and the Office, however, may use any information related
to the conduct described in the Statement of Facts against the Company: (i) in a prosecution for
perjury or obstruction of justice; (ii) in a prosecution for making a false statement; (iii) in a
prosecution or other proceeding relating to any crime of violence; (iv) in a prosecution or other
proceeding relating to any additional violation of AECA or the ITAR; or (v) in a prosecution or

other proceeding relating to a violation of any provision of Title 26 of the United States Code.

b. In addition, the Agreement does not provide any protection against prosecution of

any individuals, regardless of their affiliation with the Company.

14. | The Company represents that it has implemented and will continue to implement a
compliance and ethics program designed to prevent and detect violations of the FCPA, AECA,
ITAR, and other applicable anti-corruption and export control laws throughout its operations,
including those of its affiliates, agents, and majority-owned joint ventures, and those of its
contractors and subcontractors whose responsibilities include interacting with foreign officials or
other activities carrying a high risk of corruption and regarding the sale and export of U.S.-
controlled defense articles, including, but not limited to, the minimum elements set forth in
Attachment C.

15. In order to address any deficiencies in its internal accounting controls, policies and
procedures, the Company represents that it has undertaken, and will continue to undertake in the
future, in a manner consistent with all of its obligations under the Agreement, a review of its
existing internal accounting controls, policies and procedures regarding compliance with the

to effectively detect and deter violations of the FCPA, AECA, ITAR, and other applicable anti-
corruption and export control laws. The compliance program, including the internal accounting
controls system, will include, but not be limited to, the minimum elements set forth in Attachment
C.

Corporate Compliance Reporting

16. The Company agrees that it will report to the Fraud Section, NSD, and the Office
annually during the Term regarding remediation and implementation of the compliance measures
described in Attachment C. These reports will be prepared in accordance with Attachment D.

Deferred Prosecution

17. In consideration of the undertakings agreed to by the Company herein, the Fraud
Section, NSD, and the Office agree that any prosecution of the Company for the conduct set forth
in the Statement of Facts be and hereby is deferred for the Term. To the extent there is conduct
disclosed by the Company that is not set forth in the attached Statement of Facts, such conduct
will not be exempt from further prosecution and is not within the scope of or relevant to the
Agreement.

18. The Fraud Section, NSD, and the Office further agree that if the Company fully
complies with all of its obligations under this Agreement, the Fraud Section, NSD, and the Office
will not continue the criminal prosecution against the Company as described in Paragraph 1 above
and, at the conclusion of the Term, this Agreement shall expire. Within six months after the
Agreementâs expiration, the Fraud Section, NSD, and the Office shall seek dismissal with
prejudice of the criminal Information filed against the Company as described in Paragraph | above,
and agree not to file charges in the future against the Company based on the conduct described in

the Agreement and the Statement of Facts. .

Breach of the Agreement

19, If, during the Term, the Company (a) commits any felony under U.S. federal law;
(b) provides in connection with the Agreement deliberately false, incomplete or misleading
information, âincluding in connection with its disclosure of information about individual
culpability; (c) fails to cooperate as set forth in Paragraphs 5 and 6 of the Agreement; (d) fails to
implement a compliance program as set forth in Paragraphs 14 and 15 of the Agreement and
Attachment C; (e) commits any acts that, had they occurred within the jurisdictional reach of the
FCPA, would be a violation of the FCPA; or (f) otherwise fails to completely perform or fulfill
each of the Companyâs obligations under the Agreement, regardless of whether the Fraud Section,
NSD, and the Office become aware of such a breach after the Term is complete, the Company and
its subsidiaries shall thereafter be subject to prosecution for any federal criminal violation of which
the Fraud Section, NSD, and the Office have knowledge, including, but not limited to, the charges
in the Information as described in Paragraph | above, which may be pursued by the Fraud Section,
NSD, and the Office in the United States District Court for the District of Colombia or any other
appropriate venue. Determination of whether the Company has breached the Agreement and
whether to pursue prosecution of the Company shall be in the Fraud Section, NSD, and the Officeâs
sole discretion. Any such prosecution may be premised on information provided by the Company
or its personnel. Any such prosecution relating to the conduct described in the attached Statement
of Facts or relating to conduct known to the Fraud Section, NSD, and the Office prior to the date
on which the Agreement was signed that is not time-barred by the applicable statute of limitations
on the date of the signing of the Agreement may be commenced against the Company,
notwithstanding the expiration of the statute of limitations, between the signing of the Agreement
and the expiration of the Term plus one year. Thus, by signing the Agreement, the Company

20

 
Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 21 of 104

agrees that the statute of limitations with respect to any such prosecution that is not time-barred on
the date of the signing of the Agreement shall be tolled for the Term plus one year. In addition,
the Company agrees that the statute of limitations as to any violation of federal law that occurs
during the Term will be tolled from the date upon which the violation occurs until the earlier of
the date upon which the Fraud Section, NSD, and the Office are made aware of the violation or
the duration of the Term plus five years, and that this period shall be excluded from any calculation
of time for purposes of the application of the statute of limitations.

20. In the event the Fraud Section, NSD, and the Office determine that the Company
has breached the Agreement, the Fraud Section, NSD, and the Office agree to provide the
Company with written notice of such breach prior to instituting any prosecution resulting from
such breach. Within thirty days of receipt of such notice, the Company shall have the opportunity
to respond to the Fraud Section, NSD, and the Office in writing to explain the nature and
circumstances of such breach, as well as the actions the Company has taken to address and
remediate the situation, which explanation the Fraud Section, NSD, and the Office shall consider
in determining whether to pursue prosecution of the Company.

21, In the event that the Fraud Section, NSD, and the Office determine that the
Company has breached this Agreement: (a) all statements made by or on behalf of the Company
to the Fraud Section, NSD, and the Office or to the Court, including the Statement of Facts, and
any testimony given by the Company before a grand jury, a court, or any tribunal, or at any
legislative hearings, whether prior or subsequent to the Agreement, and any leads derived from
such statements or testimony, shall be admissible in evidence in any and all criminal proceedings
brought by the Fraud Section, NSD, and the Office against the Company; and (b) the Company
shall not assert any claim under the United States Constitution, Rule 11(f) of the Federal Rules of

21

 
Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 22 of 104

Criminal Procedure, Rule 410 of the Federal Rules of Evidence or any other federal rule that any
such statements or testimony made by or on behalf of the Company prior or subsequent to this
Agreement, or any leads derived therefrom, should be suppressed or are otherwise inadmissible.
The decision whether conduct or statements of any current director, officer or employee, or any
person acting on behalf of, or at the direction of, the Company, will be imputed to the Company
for the purpose of determining whether the Company has violated any provision of this Agreement
shall be in the sole discretion of the Fraud Section, NSD, and the Office.

22. The Company acknowledges that the Fraud Section, NSD, and the Office have
made no representations, assurances or promises concerning what sentence may be imposed by
the Court if the Company breaches the Agreement and this matter proceeds to judgment. The
Company further acknowledges that any such sentence is solely within the discretion of the Court
and that nothing in the Agreement binds or restricts the Court in the exercise of such discretion.

23. On the date that the period of deferred prosecution specified in the Agreement
expires, the Company, by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the
Company, will certify to the Fraud Section, NSD, and the Office that the Company has met its
disclosure obligations pursuant to Paragraph 6 of this Agreement. Each certification will be
deemed a material statement and representation by the Company to the executive branch of the
United States for purposes of 18 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1001 and 1519, and it will be deemed to have been
made in the judicial district in which this Agreement is filed.

Sale, Merger, or Other Change in Corporate Form of Company

24, Except as may otherwise be agreed by the parties in connection with a particular

transaction, the Company agrees that in the event that, during the Term, it undertakes any change

in corporate form, including if it sells, merges, or transfers business operations that are material to

22

 
Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 23 of 104

the Companyâs consolidated operations, or to the operations of any subsidiaries or affiliates
involved in the conduct described in the attached Statement of Facts, as they exist as of the date of
the Agreement, whether such sale is structured as a sale, asset sale, merger, transfer or other change
in corporate form, it shall include in any contract for sale, merger, transfer or other change in
corporate form a provision binding the purchaser, or any successor-in-interest thereto, to the
obligations described in the Agreement. The purchaser or successor-in-interest must also agree in
writing that the Fraud Sectionâs, NSDâs, and the Officeâs ability to breach under the Agreement is
applicable in full force to that entity. The Company agrees that the failure to include these
provisions in the transaction will make any such transaction null and void. The Company shall
provide notice to the Fraud Section, NSD, and the Office at least thirty (30) days prior to
undertaking any such sale, merger, transfer or other change in corporate form. The Fraud Section,
NSD, and the Office shall notify the Company prior to such transaction (or series of transactions)
if it determines that the transaction(s) will have the effect of circumventing or frustrating the
enforcement purposes of the Agreement. At any time during the Term the Company engages in a
transaction(s) that has the effect of circumventing or frustrating the enforcement purposes of the
Agreement, the Fraud Section, NSD, and the Office may deem it a breach of this Agreement
pursuant to Paragraphs 19-23 of the Agreement. Nothing herein shall restrict the Company from
indemnifying (or otherwise holding harmless) the purchaser or successor-in-interest for penaltiesâ
or other costs arising from any conduct that may have occurred prior to the date of the transaction,
so long as such indemnification does not have the effect of circumventing or frustrating the

enforcement purposes of the Agreement, as determined by the Fraud Section, NSD, and the Office.

23

 
Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 24 of 104

Public Statements by Company

25. The Company expressly agrees that it shall not, through present or future attorneys,
officers, directors, employees, agents or any other person authorized to speak for the Company
make any public statement, in litigation or otherwise, contradicting the acceptance of responsibility
by the Company set forth above or the facts described in the Statement of Facts. Any such
contradictory statement shall, subject to cure rights of the Company described below, constitute a
breach of this Agreement, and the Company thereafter shall be subject to prosecution as set forth
in Paragraphs 19 â 23 of the Agreement. The decision whether any public statement by any such
person contradicting a fact contained in the Statement of Facts will be imputed to the Company
for the purpose of determining whether it has breached the Agreement shall be at the sole discretion
of the Fraud Section, NSD, and the Office. If the Fraud Section, NSD, and the Office determine
that a public statement by any such person contradicts in whole or in part a statement contained in
the Statement of Facts, the Fraud Section, NSD, and the Office shall so notify the Company, and
the Company may avoid a breach of the Agreement by publicly repudiating such statement(s)
within five business days after notification. The Company shall be permitted to raise defenses and
to assert affirmative claims in other proceedings relating to the matters set forth in the Statement
of Facts provided that such defenses and claims do not contradict, in whole or in part, a statement
contained in the Statement of Facts. This Paragraph does not apply to any statement made by any
present or former officer, director, employee or agent of the Company in the course of any
criminal, regulatory or civil case initiated against such individual, unless such individual is

speaking on behalf of the Company.

24

 
Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 25 of 104

26, The Company agrees that if it or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries or
affiliates issues a press release or holds any press conference in connection with the Agreement,
the Company shall first consult with the Fraud Section, NSD, and the Office to determine (a)
whether the text of the release or proposed statements at the press conference are true and accurate
with respect to matters between the Fraud Section, NSD, the Office and the Company; and (b)
whether the Fraud Section, NSD, and the Office have any objection to the release.

27. The Fraud Section, NSD, and the Office agree, if requested to do so, to bring to
the attention of law enforcement and regulatory authorities the facts and circumstances relating to
the nature of the conduct underlying the Agreement, including the nature and quality of the
Companyâs cooperation and remediation. By agreeing to provide this information to such
authorities, the Fraud Section, NSD, and the Office are not agreeing to advocate on behalf of the
Company, but rather are agreeing to provide facts to be evaluated independently by such
authorities. Nothing in this Agreement restricts in any way the ability of the Fraud Section, NSD,
and the Office, any other federal department or agency, or any state or local government from
proceeding criminally, civilly, or administratively, against any current or former directors, officers,
employees, or agents of the Company or against any other entities or individuals. The parties to
this Agreement intend that the Agreement does not confer or provide any benefits, privileges,
immunities, or rights to any other individual or entity other than the parties hereto.

Limitations on Binding Effect of Agreement

28. The Agreement is binding on the Company, the Fraud Section, NSD, and the
Office, but specifically does not bind any other component of the United States Department of
Justice, other federal agencies, or any state, local or foreign law enforcement or regulatory
agencies, or any other authorities, although the Fraud Section, NSD, and the Office will bring the

25

 
Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 26 of 104

cooperation of the Company and its compliance with its other obligations under this Agreement to

ATTACHMENT A
STATEMENT OF FACTS

The following Statement of Facts is incorporated by reference as part of the Deferred
Prosecution Agreement (the âA greementâ) between the United States Department of Justice,
Criminal Division, Fraud Section (the âFraud Sectionâ), United States Department of Justice,
National Security Division (âNSDâ), the United States Attorneyâs Office for the District of
Columbia (the âOfficeâ) (collectively, the âUnited Statesâ), and the defendant Airbus SE. Certain
of the facts herein are based on information obtained from third parties by the Fraud Section, NSD,
and the Office through their investigation and described to Airbus. Airbus hereby agrees and
stipulates that the following facts and conclusions of law are true and accurate. Airbus admits,
accepts, and acknowledges that it is responsible for the acts of its officers, directors, employees,
and agents as set forth below. Should the Fraud Section, NSD, and the Office pursue the
prosecution that is deferred by this Agreement, Airbus agrees that it will neither contest the
admissibility of, nor contradict, this Statement of Facts in any such proceeding. The following
facts took place during the relevant time frame and establish beyond a reasonable doubt the charges
set forth in the Criminal Information attached to the Agreement.

Background

1, The defendant, Airbus SE, was a publicly traded company on the Euro Stoxx 50
market with headquarters in Leiden, Netherlands. The defendant Airbus SEâs main office was in
Toulouse, France. The defendant Airbus SE was a holding company that operated worldwide
through its subsidiaries and affiliated entities, including subsidiaries and affiliated entities that
were located in the United States (collectively âAirbusâ or the âCompanyâ). Airbus had

approximately 136,000 employees.
A-l

 
Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 32 of 104

2. Airbus was founded in 2000 as the European Aeronautic Defence & Space
Company NV (âEADS NVâ). In or about January 2014, EADS NV changed its name to Airbus
Group NV, and Airbus Group NV became the parent company. In or about May 2015, Airbus
Group NV changed its name to Airbus Group SE, and Airbus Group SE became the parent
company. In or about April 2017, Airbus Group SE changed its name to Airbus SE, and the
defendant Airbus SE became the parent company. Airbus SE is the lawful successor-in-interest to
EADS NV, Airbus Group NV, and Airbus Group SE.

3. During the relevant period, Airbusâs business was organized into divisions. The
structure changed and was progressively simplified over the period, but there were broadly three
divisions: (i) the Commercial Division, which handled, among other things, the manufacture and
sale of civilian aircraft to airlines; (ii) the Defence & Space Division, which handled, among other
things, the manufacture and sale of military aircraft, satellites, unmanned aerial systems, and other
products and services used by governmental agencies; and (iii) the Helicopters Division, which
handled the manufacture and sale of helicopters and related equipment and services.

was an employee of Chinese Government Entity 1 during all relevant times. During all relevant
times, Chinese Official 1 was a âforeign official,â as that term is defined in the FCPA, Title 15,
United States Code, Section 78dd-3(f)(2)(A).

16. Chinese Official 2, whose identity is known to the United States and the defendant,
was an employee of Chinese Government Entity 3 during all relevant times. During all relevant
times, Chinese Official 2 was a âforeign official,â as that term is defined in the FCPA, Title 15,
United States Code, Section 78dd-3(f)(2)(A).

Business Partners and the Strategy and Marketing Organization

17. From in or about and between 2008 and 2015, Airbus SE, through its employees,
executives, and agents, including members of the Strategy and Marketing Organization (âSMOâ)
and others, engaged in and facilitated a massive scheme to offer and pay bribes to decision makers
and other influencers, including to foreign officials in multiple countries, in order to obtain
improper business advantages and to win business from both privately owned enterprises and
entities that were state-owned and state-controlled. In furtherance of the corrupt bribery scheme,
Airbus employees and agents, among other things, sent emails while located in the United States

and traveled to the United States.

 
Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 35 of 104

18. The SMO was created within Airbus in approximately 2008. From at least in or
about and between 2008 and 2015, a division of the SMO, SMO International, had sole
responsibility within Airbus for managing all third-party business partners that were engaged to
assist Airbusâs Commercial Division â that is the division within Airbus that was responsible for
selling planes and services to customers engaged in the commercial airline industry. During the
same period, SMO International also reviewed and approved applications for business partners
that were involved in assisting the Defence & Space Division and the Helicopters Division. While
the business partner relationships were intended to be managed directly by the Defence & Space
Division and the Helicopters Division, there were some business partners who were used across
all Airbus divisions, and thus in practice, SMO International was also involved in managing certain
business partners for the Defence & Space Division and the Helicopters Division.

19. SMO International was the SMO division in charge of Airbusâs business
development activities. SMO International was comprised of two operational sub-divisions,
International Operations and International Development. SMO Internationalâs mission was to
support sales in all divisions of Airbus, and specifically to manage Airbusâs international business
development, strategy and marketing activities outside its home markets and the United States,
including the identification, engagement, and supervision of third party business partners and
International Marketing and Development Projects (âIMD Projectsââ).

20. From in or about and between 2008 and 2015, SMO had approximately 150
employees. SMO International had an annual maximum allowance of approximately 300 million
U.S. Dollars to engage business partners and manage IMD Projects for Airbus Commercial. Airbus

funded the SMO International allowance primarily through quarterly reimbursements sent from

A-5

 
Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 36 of 104

Airbus Commercial. Payments for the Defence & Space Division and Helicopters Division
business partners were mostly made directly from those divisions.

21. Although SMO International was responsible for agreements with business
partners, approval for the business partners was formally given by the Company Development and
Selection Committee (ââCDSCâ). The CDSC included, at different times, Airbus Executive 1,
Airbus Executive 3, and other Airbus executives and employees of the SMO. The CDSC met
approximately on a monthly basis, and its main responsibilities included approving IMD projects,
approving submitted proposals concerning the selection of potential business partners, and
finalizing agreements with business partners.

22. From in or about and between 2008 and 2015, Airbus, through its employees,
executives, and agents, engaged in and facilitated a scheme to offer and pay bribes to decision
makers and other influencers, including to foreign officials in multiple countries, in order to obtain
improper business advantages and to win business from both privately owned enterprises and
entities that were state-owned and state-controlled.

23. In order to conceal and to facilitate the corrupt bribery scheme, Airbus engaged
certain business partners, in part, to assist in the bribery scheme, and to offer and make the bribe
payments to foreign officials.

24. In order to conceal the amount of money corrupt business partners received, among
other things, Airbus Executive 3 and others funneled payments to business partners from bank
accounts not directly affiliated with Airbus, including by making payments through other business
partners and using loan schemes. The business partners that were used as intermediaries for
payments to other business partners would keep a portion of the amount as payment for services

that were falsely described in contracts and invoices and that were never provided. In certain
A-6

 
Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 37 of 104

instances, Airbus Executive 3 structured overall financial commitments to a single business partner
using separate agreements with various business partners.

25. Airbus Executive 3 maintained internal spreadsheets with annotations that showed
the actual and intended recipients of Airbus payments to business partners. Airbus Executive 3
shared these spreadsheets with certain Airbus employees.

26. | SMO International disguised and concealed the true purpose of the engagement of
the corrupt business partners in a number of ways, including by creating fake and fraudulent
contracts, receiving fake and fraudulent invoices for services that were never performed, creating
fake activity reports on behalf of business partners, developing certain âspecial projectsâ and
investment opportunities that were actually designed as an elaborate and seoret way to fund
business partners, and by concealing relationships with certain business partners by, among other
things, only engaging in oral agreements, using fake non-reimbursable loans, and paying the
business partners indirectly.

27. In or around October 2014, Airbus froze all payments to business partners engaged
on sales campaigns for the Commercial Division and subsequently froze payments to all business
partners for the Defence & Space and Helicopters Divisions in May 2015. The freeze was in effect
when the SMO was formally dissolved by Airbus.

28. Certain employees and executives at Airbus that did not have an official role within
SMO International and/or did not have direct oversight over SMO Internationalâs activities were
aware of and involved in SMO Internationalâs bribery scheme.

29. For example, Airbus Executive 5, who did not have an official role within or direct
oversight over SMO International, personally requested SMO Internationalâs assistance in certain

sales campaigns where corrupt payments were discussed, had direct contact with certain business
A-7

 
Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 38 of 104

partners, and took certain acts in furtherance of the corrupt bribery scheme â including sending
emails in furtherance of the scheme while located in the United States.

30. In addition, Airbus Executive 5 and others provided lavish travel and entertainment
to foreign officials and discussed business with them while located within the United States,
including with executives of Chinese state-owned airlines associated with the China sales
campaigns described in further detail below.

Overview of the China Bribery Scheme

31. | Chinese Government Entity 1 was a Chinese government agency that oversaw
various industries and approved infrastructure projects in China, including projects in the aviation
sector.

32. Chinese Government Entity 2 was a Chinese government agency that supervised
aviation in China. Chinese Government Entity 1 participated in the approval of Chinese
Government Entity 2âs five-year plan for acquiring aircraft for the state-owned and state-controlled
airlines in China.

33. After Chinese Government Entity 2 received approval, in part from Chinese
Government Entity 1, to acquire aircraft, it instructed Chinese Government Entity 3, another
department of the Chinese government, to negotiate and enter into an agreement referred to as a
âGeneral Terms Agreementâ to purchase aircraft from airplane manufacturers such as Airbus. A
General Terms Agreement included the type and volume of aircraft to be delivered by the airplane
manufacturer to the state-owned and state-controlled airlines in China, as well as the delivery dates.
During the General Terms Agreement approval process, Chinese Government Entity 1, Chinese

Government Entity 2, and Chinese Government Entity 3 were in dialogue with each other. General

A-8

 
Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 39 of 104

Terms Agreements signed between Airbus and Chinese Government Entity 3 referred to Chinese
Government Entity 3 as the commercial representative for the Chinese airlines,

34. In or about and between 2013 and 2015, Airbus employees and executives,
including Airbus Executive 2 and Airbus Executive 5, caused Airbus to engage Consultant | to
facilitate and conceal bribe payments intended to be paid to Chinese officials in order to obtain or
retain business in China, including to obtain and retain General Terms Agreements.

35, In or about and between 2013 and 2015, Airbus, together with others, including
certain executives, employees, and agents, knowingly and willfully conspired to make payments,
which it believed were to be used as bribes and which it intended to be used as bribes, in connection
with the approval of certain General Terms Agreements in China.

36. In order to conceal the payments and to conceal its engagement of Consultant 1,
Airbus did not pay Consultant 1 directly. Instead, Airbus made payments to a bank account in
Hong Kong in the name of a company controlled by Consultant 3, and Consultant 3 then
transferred a portion of the money to a bank account controlled by, or for the benefit of, Consultant
1.

37. The payments were intended, in part, for the purpose of paying bribes for the benefit
of foreign officials employed by departments of the Chinese government that approved the General
Terms Agreements with Airbus, including Chinese Official 1 and Chinese Official 2, to secure
improper advantages and to influence those foreign officials in order for Airbus to obtain and retain
business in China, including two General Terms Agreements in 2014.

38. In addition, in furtherance of the bribery scheme, Airbus, through its employees,
executives, and agents, invited executives from certain Chinese state-owned and state-controlled

airlines, and occasionally their families, to travel to the territory of the United States to participate
A-9

 
Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 40 of 104

in all expense-paid events, including events held at Park City, Utah, and Maui, Hawaii. Airbus
employees, including Airbus Executive 4, Airbus Executive 5, and Airbus Executive 6, and others,
traveled to the United States and elsewhere to provide these benefits to the Chinese airline
executives, to attend these events with them, and at times, to discuss business opportunities.

39. For example, executives from certain Chinese state-owned and state-controlled
airlines, as well as executives from other airlines, attended an event hosted at a luxury resort in
Maui, Hawaii, from 28 July through 2 August 2013 with Airbus Executive 4, Airbus Executive 5,
Airbus Executive 6, and other Airbus executives. The event in Hawaii included golf, scuba diving,
snorkeling cruises, horseback riding, ocean kayaking, surfing lessons, and cocktail and luau dinner
receptions. A daily half-hour business-related presentation was scheduled in the early mornings,
along with side meetings with individual customer airlines, while the rest of the agenda was
dedicated to leisure and entertainment activities.

Details of the China Bribery Scheme!

40. During 2013, SMO International, on behalf of Airbus, began discussions to engage
Consultant 1 in order to assist Airbus with obtaining and negotiating General Terms Agreements
in China. Airbus did not retain any executed agreements with Consultant 1 that described the
nature, scope, or terms of the agreement with Consultant 1.

Al. Consultant 2 provided the original introduction between Consultant 1 and Airbus.
Consultant 2 described Consultant 1 as someone who was retained due âto his long term
relationship with the political level . . . and knowing personally some key decision makers of the

customer.â

A-10

 
Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 41 of 104

42. On or about October 22, 2013, Consultant 1 sent an email to Airbus Executive 2,
in which he described his interactions with Chinese officials on behalf of Airbus and stated: âI
have committed: All payment shall be made subject to mutual acceptable method. It is also our
intention is same as yours ânot to cause any embarrassment.ââ

43. Consultant 2 communicated directly with Airbus Executive 5, Airbus Executive 6,
Airbus Executive 7 and other Airbus executives responsible for sales of commercial aircraft
regarding Airbus Executive 2âs communications and interactions with Consultant 1 and Consultant
1âs interactions with Chinese officials.

44, Consultant 1 requested proof of his engagement with Airbus, in the form of a
âcomfort letter,â which would confirm that Consultant 1 would be receiving payments from Airbus
that were intended for the Chinese government officials. Consultant 2 notified Airbus executives
that Airbus Executive 2 delayed in providing a comfort letter to Consultant 1 and warned that
Airbus would suffer consequences as a result, in the form of lower aircraft quantities approved by
the Chinese government officials in the upcoming General Terms Agreements.

45. For example, on or about October 29, 2013, Consultant 2 communicated to Airbus
Executive 5 by email that Airbus Executive 2 had a deadline of November 15, 2013 to âfirm up
withâ a âpaperâ or comfort letter.

46. Subsequently, on or about November 20, 2013, Consultant 2 sent an email to
Airbus Executive 5, stating that he was âin a difficult position to push for more detailed
information,â because of what Airbus Executive 2 âdid not deliver so far to the contacts...â

47. On or about December 5, 2013, in an email copying Airbus Executive 4, Airbus
Executive 5 informed Airbus Executive 2 and Consultant 2: âWe need support in China!â

Approximately three days later, on or about December 8, 2013, Consultant 2 responded to Airbus
A-I1

 
Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 42 of 104

Executive 5 that Airbus had the opportunity to protect its market share on single-aisle aircraft and
obtain dominant market share for wide-body aircraft, and that Airbus Executive 5 was aware of
âthe associated required resources.â |

48. â_ In or around March 2014, SMO International proposed a company affiliated with
Consultant 1 for a business partner relationship in China.

49. At around the same time, as described in the following paragraphs, Consultant 2
communicated with Airbus executives by email that delays in delivering the monetary
commitment to Chinese government officials would affect the number of aircraft approved by the |
Chinese government in the upcoming General Terms Agreement.

50. On or about March 15, 2014, Consultant 2 wrote to Airbus Executive 6 that the
situation would end in âdisasterâ if Airbus Executive 2 did not take measures. Consultant 2
explained that if nothing happened by March 25, 2014 âthere is risk of an impact on General Terms
Agreement quantities...â

51. Prior to Airbus and Chinese Government Entity 3 signing a General Terms
Agreement on or about March 26, 2014, Consultant 2 notified Airbus Executive 4, Airbus
Executive 5, Airbus Executive 6, and other Airbus executives on March 25, 2014 that, due to
Airbus Executive 2âs inaction, the quantity of aircraft proposed by Chinese government officials
in the General Terms Agreement would be 50, which was a lower quantity than Airbus had
expected. Consultant 2 referred to the lower quantity as a clear âwarningâ from the Chinese
government officials. Consultant 2 explained that Consultant 1 informed Airbus Executive 2 of
the reasons for the lower quantity of aircraft.

52. Thereafter, on March 26, 2014, in advance of the signing of the General Terms

Agreement, Consultant 2 notified Airbus Executive 4, Airbus Executive 5, Airbus Executive 6,
A-12

 
Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 43 of 104

and another Airbus executive that the final quantity of aircraft in the General Terms Agreement
would be 70 aircraft, that matters had not been settled with Airbus Executive 2, and that Airbus
should not ask for a higher quantity from the Chinese government.

53. On or about March 26, 2014, Airbus and Chinese Government Entity 3 signed a
General Terms Agreement for 70 aircraft, consisting of 43 single-aisle aircraft and 27 wide-body
aircraft.

54, On the same day, on or about March 26, 2014, Consultant 2 emailed Airbus
Executive 5 that he was âvery frustrated as much as you are. ... warnings, signals, reactions have
been crystal clear and reported every time. . .. At least this time we know perfectly what happened.
... For this afternoon, the information had been passed to our side clearly.â

55. On or about April 24, 2014, Consultant 2 emailed Airbus Executive 5 about Airbus
Executive 2âs planned April 29 meeting with Consultant 1 and communicated that when
discussions with Airbus Executive 2 âmove,â Airbus could be assured with a 50% market share,
but when such discussions were stuck, the aircraft quantities in the General Terms Agreement
would be cut.

56. On or about April 24, 2014, Airbus Executive 4, Airbus Executive 5, Airbus
Executive 6, and other Airbus executives were notified that Chinese Government Entity 2 passed
a regulation promoting airlines in China to use wide-body aircraft on domestic flights, which
Airbus was promoting in its sales campaigns in China. On or about April 25, 2014, Consultant 2
emailed Airbus Executive 5 that if the âissue (the real issue) with [Airbus Executive 2] is closed
or under a serious path of being closed,â Consultant 2 would âbe able to push stronger this

regulation issueâ with the Chinese government authorities.

A-13

 
Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 44 of 104

57. On or about May 28, 2014, Consultant 2 emailed Airbus Executive 6 that it could
be beneficial for Airbus if Airbus Executive 5 were to meet with representatives from the Chinese
government agencies involved in the aviation industry, and that Airbus Executive 2 still had âto
implement some thingsâ in order for the government officials to be âin positive listening mode.â

58. In or around June 2014, Airbus Executive 5 planned his upcoming visit to China in
coordination with Consultant 2, who attempted to arrange meetings between Airbus Executive 5
and Chinese government officials. On or about June 13, 2014, Consultant 2 wrote to Airbus
Executive 5 that he had difficulties arranging the meetings because Airbus was unable to secure
the âpaper,â and he wrote: âConsequences: unhappiness. No meetings so far.â

59, On or about June 16, 2014, Consultant 2 emailed Airbus Executive 5 that he was
able to secure a private dinner for Airbus Executive 5 with Chinese Official 1 of Chinese
Government Entity 1 and Chinese Official 2 of Chinese Government Entity 3. Consultant 2 stated
that he was doing the best he could âwith empty handsâ but that there was âno real thing moving

as far as no concrete steps are takenâ by SMO International.

60. On or about June 22, 2014, Consultant 2 emailed Airbus Executive 5 about the
aforementioned dinner between Airbus Executive 5 and Chinese Official 1 and Chinese Official
2, stating that no one would be âpositiveâ unless the âdocumentâ was kept safely and âflow of
concrete evidence starts.â

61. On or about June 24, 2014, Airbus Executive 3 sent an email to a notary in Geneva,
Switzerland, stating that he was contacting the notary on recommendation of Airbus Consultant 3.

62. On or about June 28, 2014, Consultant 2 emailed Airbus Executive 7 regarding
Consultant 1âs communications with Chinese government officials. Specifically, Consultant 1

reported that Chinese Official 1 had been under âextreme pressureâ to have dinner with Airbus
A-14

 
Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 45 of 104

Executive 5 and to give the clear message to Airbus that the âdoorâ would be âclosed until you
deliver.â

63. On or about July 2, 2014, Airbus executives, including Airbus Executive 1, Airbus
Executive 2, Airbus Executive 3, and others, discussed over email replacing the authorization to
engage Consultant 1âs company in China with authorization to proceed with Consultant 3âs
company.

64. On or about July 9, 2014, Airbus Executive 2 forwarded a text message from
Consultant | to Airbus Executive 1. In the text message, Consultant 1 wrote that Airbus Executive
4 was received by the government officials at Chinese Government Entity 1 and Chinese
Government Entity 2. Consultant 1 cautioned Airbus Executive 2 that âYour people should now
understand how our system works .. . itâs the first time no package given ...no matter how much
pressure you hv [sic] put on from political and diplomatie [sic] front, its not my nature to see this
since we are friends. I want to complete all pending issues with your support ASAP to avoid further
head ache for you & me: 1). Deposit the paper; 2). Agreement on normal marketing flow; 3).
Details project implementation agreement. We need to complete the above 3 tasks ASAP if [Airbus
Executive 4] wants to achieve those he wishes before year end, I think [Airbus Executive 4] rvd
the strongest signal from our people during his visit!â

65. On or about July 21, 2014, the CDSC approved the proposed business partner
relationship between Consultant 3âs company and Airbus. The agreement with Consultant 3 was
purportedly for a separate business arrangement in China, but it was really designed as a means to
provide money to Consultant 1.

66. On the following day, on or about July 22, 2014, Airbus Executive 2 signed a

consulting agreement with Consultant 3âs company covering the period July 2013 to December
A-15

 
Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 46 of 104

2014. To support this fake consulting agreement, Consultant 3 subsequently submitted an activity
report to Airbus regarding its purported contributions in supporting the separate business
arrangement, which Consultant 3 never actually assisted with. Airbus Executive 3 was a custodian
of an electronic document that began with wording identical to the wording included in the
submitted activity report.

67. On or about July 23, 2014, Airbus Executive 5 sent an email to Airbus Executive 4
stating that Airbus was facing âdifficult political oppositionâ in âChinaâ and requesting that SMO
International inquire into Consultant 3âs company for help with campaigns in China. Airbus
Executive 5 claimed in the email that he was unaware of Consultant 3âs company but that SMO
International recommended it. The email was forwarded by Airbus Executive 4 to Airbus
Executive 1, confirming the âbusiness requirementsâ related to Consultant 3.

68. Onor about July 24, 2014, the head of Compliance at Airbus Group emailed Airbus
Executive 5, identifying a contradiction in the CDSCâs meeting minutes from March 11, 2014: the
minutes stated that the request for business partner support in China came directly from Airbusâs
Commercial Division, whereas Airbus Executive 5 was now stating that he was unaware of
Consultant 3âs company.

69. That same day, on or about July 24, 2014, Airbus Executive 5, while in the territory
of the United States, sent an email responding to the head of Compliance at Airbus Group and
directing him to alter the CDSC meeting minutes referenced above.

70. That same day, on or about July 24, 2014, Airbus Executive 5, while in the territory
of the United States, emailed other Airbus executives and reiterated that changing the CDSC

minutes would be âthe best way forward.â

 
Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 47 of 104

71. On or about July 28, 2014, Airbus paid Consultant 3 10.35 million Euros
(approximately 14 million U.S. Dollars) under the business partner agreement related to Airbusâs
separate business arrangement in China, referenced in paragraphs 65-66 above. The funds were
wired by Airbus to Consultant 3âs bank account in Hong Kong but were intended for Consultant
1 for his assistance with the General Terms Agreements. SMO International spreadsheets and
correspondence indicated that Airbus paid Consultant 1 10.35 million Euros (14 million U.S.
Dollars) via a payment to an entity owned by Consultant 3.

72. On or about August 13, 2014, Consultant 2 emailed Airbus Executive 6, copying
Airbus Executive 5, regarding Airbus Executive 5âs upcoming meeting with Chinese Official 1 in
China in September. Consultant 2 indicated that none of SMO Internationalâs commitments have
been fulfilled, and that Consultant 2 was risking his credibility.

73. On or about August 21, 2014, Airbus Executive 7 sent an email to Airbus Executive
4 and Airbus Executive 5 stating that Consultant 1, whom he referred to as Airbus Executive 2âs
âfriend,â âdidnât get the expected good newsâ and that âeven if first action shows up in next 2/3
weeks ... it will most probably be urgent also to progress very quickly on the âdocumentâ
management.â

74, On or about August 23, 2014, Consultant 2 sent an email to Airbus Executive 7,
stating that Consultant 1 had resent his bank details to Airbus Executive 2 and Airbus Executive 3
and was âballisticâ that Airbus Executive 3 had sent Consultant | a text that Airbus rejected the
âfirst good news.â

75, On or about August 26, 2014, Consultant 2 emailed Airbus Executive 5 that
Chinese Official 1 was considering dinner with Airbus Executive 5 in Beijing but that dinner was

âdependent upon the first good news.â Subsequently, on or about September 5, 2014, Consultant
A-17

 
Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 48 of 104

2 notified Airbus Executive 5 that he was able to arrange for him to have dinner with Chinese
Official 1 during his upcoming visit to China in September. Consultant 2 warned Airbus Executive
5 that âthe discussion will be difficult: still drastic lack of confirmed trust as they want to have the
evidence of a stable and smooth implementation of what was committed and after nearly one year
and a half of renewed contact.â

76. In or around September 2014, Consultant 1 and Airbus Executive 3 discussed by
email how Consultant 1 would be paid for his services. Airbus Executive 3 wrote to Consultant 1
that a Middle Eastern âsending companyâ would be providing Consultant 1 with a loan and
attached a draft loan facility agreement in which another entity owned by Consultant 3 was listed
as the lender. Airbus Executive 3 emailed Consultant | a draft loan facility agreement for an
amount of 7.7 million Euros, which listed Consultant 3âs Lebanese company as the lender. The
notice provision in the agreement set forth that notices to the lender should be addressed to
Consultant 3. According to an email by Airbus Executive 3, the loan facility agreement was
intended to âspeed up the last delivery.â

77. On or about September 10, 2014, after Consultant | indicated to Airbus Executive
3 that he wanted to redraft the loan agreement, Airbus Executive 3 asked if Consultant 1 had a
preferred âspecial & secure numberâ to use for a telephone conversation. Airbus Executive 3 also
wrote âplease advise receipt of second batch I boosted to 50% making now 70% total.â

78. On the following day, on or about September 11, 2014, Consultant 2 emailed
Airbus Executive 4 and Airbus Executive 5, and subsequently Airbus Executive 7, regarding his
discussions with Consultant 1 about outstanding payments from Airbus and the Chinese officialsâ
internal discussions regarding their plans to acquire single-aisle and wide-body aircraft from

Airbus. On the basis of his discussion with Consultant 1, Consultant 2 warned that the Chinese
A-18

 
Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 49 of 104

officials would not move forward in their acquisition of aircraft from Airbus âas far as: 1 â what
is due as of today and since January 2013 is done with a minimum of what has been promised (as
of tonight only 18% has arrived and for the rest method not acceptable at all) 2- Paper is kept has
already organized but process brutally interrupted with no explanation so far.â

79. On the same day, on or about September 11, 2014, Airbus Executive 5 responded
to Airbus Executive 4 and Consultant 2 by email that Chinese Official 1 âmust stop the sabotageâ
and that a state-owned Chinese airline was ready to finalize a deal with Airbus for its wide-body
aircraft, but Chinese Official 2 âactively discouraged any A330 [wide-body] deals with Airbus.â
Airbus Executive 5 wrote âThis must change. [Chinese Government Entity 1] ([Chinese Official
1]) and [Chinese Government Entity 2] must be actively supportive.â In response to Airbus
Executive 5âs email, Consultant 2 responded that Chinese Official 1 was not the only one blocking
Airbus, but that it was a âsystemâ and that Chinese Official 1 and Chinese Official 2 âare the
windows.â In response, Airbus Executive 5 wrote to Airbus Executive 4 and Consultant 2 â[W]e
must âopen the windows.ââ Consultant 2 responded to Airbus Executive 4 and Airbus Executive
5, âI gave you some windows and doors... we are all and still waiting for the keys. . . after exactly
one year and a half.â In response, Airbus Executive 5 directed Consultant 2 to call him on his
cellular telephone.

80. In or around late September 2014, Airbus Executive 3 and Consultant 1 exchanged
_ emails on how to âunlockâ the âpast and on-goingâ âtransaction(s).â Consultant 1 communicated
to Airbus Executive 3 that he could not proceed on his current recommendation; Airbus Executive
3 forwarded Consultant 1âs email to Airbus Executive 2, stating that he needed a âdocumentâ to

make further payments to Consultant 1.

 
Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 50 of 104

81. At around the same time, the CDSC considered a retrospective engagement of
Consultant 1âs company, which was ultimately not signed. An internal Airbus document stated
that Consultant 1âs company would provide broader support for Airbus commercial campaigns in
China than Consultant 3âs company and that Consultant 1 was a âChinese businessman who
demonstrated in the past his capability to lobby Chinese administration.â The document referenced
an âexpected remunerationâ of 18 million U.S. Dollars.

82. Onor about October 11,.2014, Airbus and Chinese Government Entity 3 signed a
General Terms Agreement for 70 single-aisle aircraft.

83. In or around late October 2014, Airbus froze all payments to business partners
engaged on sales campaigns for the Commercial Division.

84. At around the same time, Consultant | threatened litigation against Airbus over
payments that Consultant 1 claimed Airbus owed him. For example, on or about October 26, 2014,
Consultant 1 sent an email to Airbus Executive 2 in which he referenced the âtwo legal binding
document[s]â signed by Airbus Executive 2 on behalf of Airbus and âwith full acknowledge of
your senior management.â Subsequently, when Airbus Executive 7 forwarded Consultant 1âs
email to Consultant 2 and asked whether he should inform Airbus Executive 5 of the threatened
litigation, Consultant 2 advised to wait until a meeting occurred with Consultant 1 in Hong Kong.
At around the same time, Airbus Executive 7 discussed with Consultant 2 alternative ways to
compensate Consultant | for his assistance with the General Terms Agreements, including whether
âprojectsâ could be set up in order to compensate Consultant 1.

85. On or about October 26, 2014, Consultant 1 also emailed Airbus Executive 2 that
his agreement with Airbus had not been cancelled and that he did not know whom to communicate

with at Airbus. Consultant 1 wrote that he wanted the contact information for Airbus Executive
A-20

2âs successor âin order to continue to work and implement based on the platform you built and
agreement signed.â

86. On or about November 26, 2014, Consultant 2 sent an email to Airbus Executive 4
and Airbus Executive 5, stating that Chinese Official 2 âis still the window to structure the dealsâ
in China and that Airbus executives could meet with Chinese Official 1âs successor in the future.
Consultant 2 wrote âOn one hand some at the Central such as [Chinese Government Entity 1] are
blocking (informally) . . . on the other hand they are still keeping the door slightly open as: 1.
Nobody told them it was over 2. They feel very confident firm commitments can be proven
anytime 3. They know and agree to play with the new methods scheme a <<positive exit>> from
the present situation.â

Travel and Entertainment of Chinese Foreign Officials

87, Airbus China and Chinese Government Entity 3 established a Fund (âFundâ) in
2011 via a handshake agreement between Airbus Executive 6 and Chinese Official 2. Airbus China
made monetary contributions to the Fund; certain Airbus employees expected that, in exchange,
Chinese Government Entity 3 would speed up the allocation of aircraft to airlines in China in
relation to General Terms Agreements signed that year and the previous year.

88. The stated purpose of the Fund was to support projects ârelated to services for the
Chinese commercial aviation industry, including but not limited to aviation related management
education, seminars, and pilot educational facilities.â In reality, the Fund was used, in part, to pay
event agencies to host social events for Chinese government officials, including members of
Chinese Government Entity 3 and executives of the Chinese airlines.

89. Under the Fundâs governing documents, an appointed Fund committee, composed

of members from Airbus China, including Airbus Executive 6, and an official from Chinese
A-21

 
Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 52 of 104

Government Entity 3, were responsible for administering the Fund as well as evaluating and
approving proposed events and projects to be supported by the Fund. Once an event or project was
approved, suppliers were engaged to organize the social events. Some of the suppliers were fully
or partially owned by Chinese Government Entity 3 or the Chinese airlines.

90. From 2012 to 2017, the Fund was used to support 13 events and projects, including
golf retreats and leisure events that had limited business-related content and fell outside the stated
purpose of the Fund. Chinese Official 2 was the originator of at least five of these events.

91, Airbus Executive 5âs approval was sought for six of these events. For example, on
or about February 10, 2014, an Airbus employee emailed Airbus Executive 5, copying Airbus
Executive 6, and seeking Airbus Executive 5âs âfinal approvalâ for an âurgent sponsorship.â The
employee described a golf invitational in China aimed at top level officials of Chinese airlines and
stated that the event would be paid for by the Fund. On or about February 14, 2014, Airbus
Executive 5, while in the territory of the United States, emailed his approval of the leisure event
to Airbus | Executive 6 and the Airbus employee who initially sought Airbus Executive 5âs
approval.

92. The Fund was also used to fund leisure trips in China, which were attended by
executives from Chinese Government Entity 1, Chinese Government Entity 2, Chinese
Government Entity 3, certain executives from Chinese state-owned and state-controlled airlines,

and several employees of Airbus China.

Arms Export Control Act and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations
Applicable Law

93. The Arms Export Control Act (*AECAâ), 22 U.S.C. Â§ 2778, authorized the
President to control, among other things, the export of defense articles deemed critical to the
national security and foreign policy interests of the United States. By Executive Order 13637, the
President delegated this authority to the United States Department of State, Directorate of Defense
Trade Controls (âDDTCâ), empowering DDTC to review and grant export licenses for the transfer
or retransfer of defense articles and defense services identified on the United States Munitions List
(âUSMLâ). DDTC is located in the District of Columbia. Pursuant to its authority under the
AECA, DDTC promulgated the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (âSITARâ), 22 C.F.R. Â§Â§
120-130, which contained the USML. Accordingly, the export of USML defense articles and
defense services is governed by the AECA and ITAR.

94, Airbus designed, manufactured, and sold certain products containing âdefense
articles,â and furnished certain âdefense services,â as defined in 22 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 120.6 and 120.9,
respectively, which were controlled by the AECA and ITAR. Generally, these products were sold
by Airbusâs Defence & Space and Helicopters divisions. Between on or about December 1, 2011,
and continuing through on or about December 1, 2016 (âthe relevant ITAR time periodâ), Airbus
violated U.S. law related to the sale of ITAR-controlled defense articles and furnishing of defense
services by:

a. Paying political contributions, fees, and commissions in association with the sale

of ITAR-controlled defense articles or defense services and failing to report the

same to the DDTC, as required by 22 C.F.R. Â§ 130; and

A-23

 
Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 54 of 104

b. Failing to keep records related to the sales of ITAR-controlled defense articles or
defense services for a period of not less than five years, as required by 22 C.F.R.
Â§ 130.14.

95. Additionally, during the relevant ITAR time period, Airbus used third-party
business partners, including but not limited to business partners from countries prohibited by 22
C.F.R. Â§ 126, who had failed to register as brokers to assist in sales of ITAR-controlled defense
articles or defense services, in violation of 22 C.F.R. Â§ 129. Airbusâs conduct, while not
âknowing[]â or âwillful[],â nonetheless, thus âcause[d], aid[ed], abet[ted], .. . or permit[ed]â the
business partnersâ unauthorized brokering of defense articles or defense services. See 22 C.F.R.
Â§ 127.1(e).

ITAR Part 130

96. Pursuant to the AECA, 22 U.S.C. Â§ 2279, and the ITAR, 22 C.F.R. Â§ 130.9, certain
Applicants (as defined in 22 C.F.R. Â§ 130.2) applying for export licenses were required to inform
DDTC as to whether the Applicant or its Vendors (as defined in 22 C.F.R. Â§ 130.8) had paid,
offered, or agreed to pay political contributions, fees, or commissions in connection with the sale
or transfer of a defense article or defense service. The purpose of this provision was to provide
Executive Branch oversight of the sale of U.S. military technology and prevent âimproper
influenceâ in those sales. H.R. REP. 94-1144, 58, 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1378, 1434. Under these
provisions, for defense articles or defense services valued in an amount of $500,000 or more that
are sold commercially to or for the use of the Armed Forces of a foreign country or international.
organization (as defined in 22 C.F.R. Â§ 130.3), an Applicant must report to the DDTC any
payments or agreements to pay (i) political contributions of $5,000 or more, and (ii) fees and

commissions of $100,000 or more. 22 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 130.1, 2.
A-24

 
Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 55 of 104

97. Further, under 22 C.F.R. Â§ 130.11, all Applicants to the DDTC and their Vendors
had an ongoing obligation to correct any false statements or omissions on previous export license
applications, including false statements or omissions covered by Part 130.

98. Additionally, under 22 C.F.R. Â§ 130.14, each Applicant, Supplier (as defined in 22
C.F.R. Â§ 130.7), and Vendor was required to maintain a record of any information it was required
to furnish or obtain under Part 130 and all records upon which its reports were based for a period
of not less than five years following the date of the report to which they pertained.

ITAR Part 129

99. Pursuant to 22 C.F.R. Â§ 129.3, any person who engaged in brokering activities by
taking any action on behalf of another to facilitate the manufacture, export, transfer, re-export, or
retransfer of a U.S. or foreign defense article or defense service was required to register with
DDTC. Prior to October 25, 2013, ITAR Part 129 and its broker registration requirements applied
to all brokers, regardless of their U.S. connection. On October 25, 2013, the regulation was
amended to narrow the definition of a âbrokerâ to include: (1) any U.S. person wherever located;
(2) any foreign person located in the United States; and (3) any foreign person located outside the
United States where the foreign person is owned (more than 50 percent) or controlled by a U.S.
person. See 78 FR 52690, Aug. 26, 2013. These revisions went into effect on October 25, 2013,
and were applicable during the relevant ITAR time period.

100. In addition, pursuant to 22 C.F.R. Â§ 129.10, any person required to register as a
broker was to provide DDTC with an annual report of its brokering activities, identifying the
quantity, description, and U.S. dollar value of the defense articles or defense services provided, as
well as the type and U.S. dollar value of any consideration received by any person who participated

in the brokering activities, and the source thereof.
A-25

 
Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 56 of 104

101. Under 22 C.F.R. Â§ 127.1 (e), it was unlawful to knowingly or willfully cause, aid,
abet, counsel, demand, procure, or permit the commission of any act prohibited by, or the omission
of any act required by the AECA, or any regulation, license, approval or order issued thereunder.

ITAR Part 126.1

102. Pursuant to 22 C.F.R. Â§ 126.1, it was the policy of the United States to deny licenses
and other approvals for exports and imports of defense articles and defense services, destined for
or originating in certain countries (hereinafter, âProhibited Countryâ or âProhibited Countriesâ).
During the relevant ITAR time period, for example, Lebanon,â among other countries, was subject
to certain prohibitions.

103. Additionally, 22 C.F.R. Â§ 126.1(e)(1) restricted the sale or transfer of any defense
articles or services to certain Prohibited Countries âor any person acting on its behalfâ without
written approval of the DDTC. It was the policy of the DDTC to deny licenses and approvals
involving persons acting on the behalf of certain Prohibited Countries, except as specified in
paragraphs (f) through (w) of Section 126.1. Additionally, 22 C.F.R. Â§ 126.1(â¬)(2) imposed a duty
to notify DDTC about any sale or transfer involving certain Prohibited Countries or persons acting
on their behalf.

104. Furthermore, 22 C.F.R. Â§ 129.7 prohibited engaging in brokering activities that
involved any country, area, or person referred to in Â§ 126.1 without first obtaining the approval of
DDTC. Further, it was the policy of DDTC to deny requests for approval of brokering activities

involving certain countries or persons referred to in Â§ 126.1.

 

2 On December 15, 2006, Lebanon was added as a restricted country to 22 C.F.R. Â§ 126.1, thereby
suspending all approvals for licenses to export or otherwise transfer defense articles and defense
services to Lebanon, except those authorized by the Government of Lebanon or the United Nations
Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). See 71 FR 75609 (Dec. 15, 2006).

Knowledge of Legal Duties and Willful Conduct

105. Airbus had knowledge of its requirements under ITAR Part 129 and 130. Airbusâs
violations of the ITAR, including willful violations of ITAR Part 130, were the result of several
factors, including: the Companyâs ongoing use of business partners in its sales of ITAR-controlled
defense articles and defense services; willful efforts and reluctance by certain Company employees
to prevent disclosure of business partner relationships and payments; the Company structuring the
compliance function as separate and siloed from business sales and the export compliance
function, which prevented accurate ITAR compliance; and the Company failing to provide
adequate training about ITAR Part 129 and Part 130 for its employees. As a result, with respect to
Part 130, Airbus willfully failed to report or under-reported political contributions, fees, and
commissions to the DDTC.

106. Had political contributions, fees, and commissions paid by Airbus (through the
SMO or otherwise) been properly reported to the DDTC as part of Airbusâs ITAR filings, such
disclosure could have triggered oversight by DDTC and other agencies, including in the form of a
referral by DDTC to law enforcement. If the DDTC had known that Airbus willfully submitted
applications that contained false or incomplete ITAR Part 130 certifications, the DDTC would not
have approved the relevant license applications.

107. Moreover, had Airbusâs over one thousand business partners who were used to sell
ITAR-controlled defense articles and defense services sought to register as brokers as required by
ITAR Part 129, such voluminous use of brokers could have triggered oversight by the DDTC or a
referral by DDTC to law enforcement. Thus, Airbusâs failure to ensure that its business partners
were registered in compliance with ITAR Part 129 further permitted the Company to conduct its

operations without sufficient and adequate oversight by DDTC. Additionally, had Airbusâs
A-27

 
Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 58 of 104

business partners from Prohibited Countries attempted to register as brokers, those applications
likely would have been denied by DDTC, thereby potentially alerting the Company to the risks of
engaging such business partners.

108. Airbusâs relevant conduct occurred in several locations, including but not limited
to Airbusâs headquarters in France and its subsidiaries in Germany, Spain, and the United States,
with the direct involvement, knowledge, and approval of Airbus management personnel.

Knowledge of ITAR Part 129 and Part 130 Requirements

109. Beginning in or around September 2009 and no later than in or around June 2011,
Airbus was aware of the ITAR Part 129 and 130 requirements regulating the registration of brokers
and the disclosure of political contributions, fees, and commissions paid in connection with sales
of defense articles and defense services, as applied to Airbusâs business partners. Specifically, in
or around September 2009, a memorandum entitled âPart 130 ITAR-U.S. Requirements Under the
International Traffic in Arms Regulations for Providing Information on Fees, Commissions, and
Contributionsâ was circulated by a senior compliance employee at the Defence & Space Division,
Airbus Export Compliance Employee 1. The memorandum also included on its distribution list a
senior executive in the SMO with knowledge of the Companyâs use of business partners. Further
in the fall of 2009, export compliance leadership at Airbusâs U.S. subsidiary discussed the
application of ITAR Part 130 to non-U.S. persons and retransfer requests, in connection with sales
campaigns of the Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft. By April 2010, Airbus senior export compliance
staff within the Defence & Space Division, including Airbus Export Compliance Employee. |,
discussed the need to establish a procedure to furnish required information regarding political
contributions, fees, or commissions to the DDTC. Despite this discussion, no action was taken by

the Company to establish a procedure to furnish the requisite information to the DDTC.
A-28

 
Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 59 of 104

110. In May 2011, the U.S. Department of State entered into a consent agreement with
BAE Systems PLC (âBAEâ), regarding BAEâs noncompliance with ITAR Parts 129 and 130, and
BAEâs willful false statements regarding the same (hereinafter âBAE consent agreementâ).
Following the news of the BAE consent agreement, Airbus discussed its compliance with its
obligations under Part 130, and multiple senior-level export compliance officials at Airbusâs parent
group and within the Defence & Space Division corresponded about the applicability of ITAR Part
130 to various Airbus products, including Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft. For instance, in June 2011,
a senior export compliance officer at the French subsidiary stated to the senior export compliance
officer at Airbusâs parent group that Airbus âcannot escape the obligations created by ITARâ when
re-exporting Airbus products to end users other than those originally licensed by the DDTC. In
late 2011, an export compliance officer at the French subsidiary wrote an internal memorandum
on ITAR Parts 129 and 130, which discussed the requirements of the ITAR, the scope of reporting
obligations under Part 130, and how Part 130 applied to intermediaries or brokers.

111. Subsequently, Airbus discussed ITAR Part 129 and Part 130 compliance with its
joint venture partners with whom it manufactured the Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft, showing its
awareness of its obligations under the ITAR. In the fall of 2012, one of the joint venture partners
specifically told Airbus that DDTC had questioned the joint venture partner about ITAR and
whether the other joint venture partners, including Airbus, were complying with Part 130. The
joint venture partner also shared with Airbus its own internal policy related to Part 130.

112. Moreover, in 2013 and 2014, management at Airbus discussed whether ITAR Part
130 filings were required for certain specific sales campaigns, further evidencing Airbusâs

knowledge of its reporting requirements in the context of actual sales.

A-29

 
Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 60 of 104

113. Additionally, Airbus received communications from the DDTC regarding
compliance with ITAR Part 130 that further put Airbus on notice of its disclosure obligations. On
January 18, 2013, DDTC issued to Airbus an advisory opinion noting the ârequirements of the
ITAR that are applicable to . . . reporting of political contributions, fees, and commissions under
Part 130.â The same year, compliance managers at Airbus received and reviewed DDTCâs
industry-wide guidance on ITAR Part 130 filing requirements. In December 2014, DDTC
contacted Airbusâs U.S. subsidiary âas a precaution and to prompt thinking at Airbusâ about Part
130 disclosures in the context of specific product sales related to border security. Personnel at
Airbusâs U.S. subsidiary escalated the DDTCâs concerns to Airbus colleagues in Germany and
France working on the relevant sales campaign.

Willful Efforts to Conceal Payments to Business Partners jrom ITAR Disclosure

114. Airbus willfully concealed its political contributions, fees, and commissions paid
to business partners in conjunction with the sale or transfer of defense articles and defense services.
During the relevant ITAR time period, Airbus was paying political contributions, fees, and
commissions in coordination with sales campaigns and contracts for Airbus products that
contained ITAR-controlled defense articles and defense services. Specifically, the Defence &
Space Division, which incorporated ITAR-controlled defense articles within most of its products,
used business partners during the relevant ITAR time period. The Helicopters Division, which also
had ITAR-controlled defense articles in many of its products and whose customers could choose
to add optional ITAR-controlled defense articles to their helicopters, used business partners during
the relevant ITAR time period. Some of the business partners used by the Defence & Space
Division and Helicopters Division were approved by SMO International, and certain Defence &

Space Division and Helicopters Division business partners were managed by SMO International.
A-30

 
Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 61 of 104

Moreover, several of the SMO Internationalâs most frequently used business partners were used
on sales of both commercial aircraft and defense articles and defense services. However, Airbusâs
failure to comply with ITAR Parts 130, 129, and 126.1 occurred regardless of whether the business
partner was associated with SMO International.

115. Airbus willfully obscured from oversight the activity of SMO International, and
Airbus more generally, in the payments of political contributions, fees, and commissions to
business partners on sales of defense articles and defense services. For instance, as early as June
2011, Airbus Export Compliance Officer | stated, âT doubt that we will ever open our books on a
business partnerâ when discussing whether Airbus was required to report business partner
payments to a U.S. supplier under ITAR Part 130.

Failure of Export Compliance Internal Controls

116. With knowledge of the ITAR Part 129 and Part 130 requirements, Airbus
repeatedly discussed setting internal policies and procedures for ITAR Part 130. As early as June
2013, senior export compliance management at the Defence & Space Division circulated an
internal Airbus memorandum that identified risk related to ITAR Part 130 disclosures and
recommended an internal policy and procedure addressing compliance with Part 130. Some of the
same export compliance management were aware during this time period that Airbus used business
partners in sales by the Defence & Space Division. Numerous times over the next few years, senior
export compliance management discussed instituting an ITAR Part 130 compliance policy.
Nonetheless, Airbus did not adopt any policy on ITAR Part 130 until December 30, 2016, despite
the fact that the issues were discussed by senior managers in positions to make changes.

117. Although Airbus had policies and procedures designed to ensure that the Company

complied with the ITAR, Airbus failed to train its employees adequately to ensure that employees
A-31

 
Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 62 of 104

who certified information as part of ITAR license applications fully complied with Airbusâs
policies and procedures, and assured compliance with the ITAR, specifically with ITAR Part 130.
Lack of Oversight of Export Compliance Process

118. Inand around July 2015, the newly appointed in-house General Counsel at Airbusâs
parent company identified potential issues with the ITAR Part 130 disclosure framework. In
response to these concerns, senior export control officers appeared reluctant to change the
companyâs existing compliance process. Specifically, a senior export compliance executive wrote
to the General Counsel that adequate processes and procedures were in place, stating that,
regarding DDTC applications: (i) âproper due diligence was done prior to signatureâ on the
application, (ii) templates used âensure[d]ââ attention to ITAR Part 130 representations, and (iii)
each application was âreviewed carefully to ensure that . . . [it] meets the obligations of Part 130
whether a required statement needs to be included or not.â These statements were reviewed by
senior export compliance management prior to being made.

119. In fact, as described further herein, adequate processes and procedures were not in
place to ensure compliance with ITAR Part 129 and Part 130 during the relevant ITAR time period,
and the aforementioned export compliance management knew the same. |

Part 130 Violations

120. ITAR license applications were often signed by export compliance personnel at the
relevant Airbus business component (i.e., the Defence & Space Division or Helicopters Division
subsidiary in the country of production), although at times they were signed by U.S. export
compliance personnel. Export compliance personnel at the business components were generally
aware that business partners were used, but they did not personally have access to any business

partner agreements and did not know which business partners were associated with which Airbus
A-32

 
Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 63 of 104

sales campaigns. The Companyâs export compliance personnel did not personally verify the
payments of political contributions, fees, and commissions, and generally did not inquire with sales
personnel about the same. Nonetheless, these same export compliance personnel routinely signed
certifications on ITAR license applications attesting that no political contributions, fees, and
commissions had been paid as a part of the sale and export of the defense articles and defense
services for which Airbus was seeking DDTC approval. In fact, a template for ITAR license
applications used by Airbus during the relevant ITAR time period had as the standard language
that âno political contributions, fees, and commissions had been paid.â The template was sent to
compliance managers in the United States, Spain, and France for review and comment after its
creation in June 2011.

121. Airbusâs U.S.-based export compliance staff filed or assisted in the filing of many
of the ITAR license applications. Specifically, the U.S.-based export compliance staff would
ensure the proper paperwork was filed, but the representations contained therein regarding the
requesting entity, end user, and purpose for the item were furnished by the relevant Airbus business
component located outside the United States. U.S.-based export compliance staff performed no
independent due diligence outside the certifications provided by their colleagues outside the
United States prior to filing ITAR Part 130 disclosures. Moreover, U.S.-based export compliance
staff worked in a separate office from the underlying sales teams and did not verify the use of
business partners on specific sales campaigns.

Part 126 and Part 129 Failures

122. During the relevant ITAR time period, business partners used by Airbus entities, to

include the Defence & Space Division and Helicopters Division, were reviewed and approved by

SMO International, and then approved at their respective Divisions. It was not part of the
A-33

 
Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 64 of 104

Companyâs approval processes to require the business partners, who were assisting in sales of
ITAR-controlled defense articles and defense services, to show proof of registration as brokers
with DDTC. During the relevant ITAR time period, business partners were generally used by
Airbus for sales of ITAR-controlled products even though Airbus had no knowledge of the
business partnersâ compliance with 22 C.F.R. Â§ 129 and Airbus in fact used business partners who
were not registered with the DDTC as required.

123. Moreover, Airbus had no systems in place to determine whether business partners
used by Airbus were from countries with which dealings were restricted under 22 C.F.R. Â§ 126.
During the relevant ITAR time period, Airbus used business partners who were citizens of or
incorporated in Prohibited Countries listed in ITAR Part 126, including Lebanon, and those
business partners were neither registered as brokers with DDTC as required by ITAR Section 129.3
nor licensed by the DDTC to engage in brokering activities under ITAR Section 129.4. Airbusâs
compliance systems failed to prevent payments to business partners from Prohibited Countries
who participated in brokering activities for ITAR-controlled defense articles and defense services.

ITAR Violations
. Voluntary Disclosures

124. On November 30, 2016, Airbus sent an initial notification of voluntary disclosure
to the DDTC regarding certifications and reports under ITAR Parts 129 and 130.

125. On July 31, 2017, Airbus sent a detailed voluntary disclosure to the DDTC
identifying Part 130 violations related to license applications previously filed with DDTC as well
as violations related to ITAR Part 129 and the ITARâs recordkeeping requirements.

126. Airbus sent supplemental disclosures to DDTC on November 30, 2017, and January

30, 2018. Airbus also filed a report with DDTC on March 1, 2018, wherein it identified corrective
A-34

 
Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 65 of 104

actions it had taken related to ITAR Part 130 compliance. Thereafter, on February 25, 2019,
September 20, 2019, and November 3, 2019, Airbus responded to various questions by the DDTC
related to its disclosures.

127. Additionally, on or about September 6, 2017, counsel for Airbus met with the
Department of Justice, National Security Division (âNSDâ), and provided to NSD the disclosure
it made to DDTC on July 31, 2017.

Willful Violations of Part 130

128. Airbus filed numerous license applications during the relevant ITAR time period.
Airbus violated ITAR Part 130 by paying political contributions, fees, and commissions on at least
forty transactions and failing to properly report the same to the U.S. Department of State, as
required. In general, Airbus repeatedly filed license applications with the DDTC stating that ITAR
Part 130 did not apply to the application or claiming that no business partner payments were made,
and attesting to the accuracy of any ITAR Part 130 disclosures when in fact Airbus did nothing to
verify the accuracy of those statements.

129. Additionally, Airbus routinely failed to adhere to the recordkeeping obligations of
22 C.F.R. Â§ 130.14 for its license applications, which required Airbus to keep records related to
the license applications for a period of five years.

C-295 Exports

130. During the relevant ITAR time period, Airbus manufactured C-295 airplanes,
which were a twin-turboprop tactical military transport aircraft. Airbus sold C-295 military aircraft
to various countries and their Armed Forces. The C-295s sold by Airbus generally included

defense articles subject to regulation under the ITAR.

"" A-35

 
Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 66 of 104

131. Airbusâs C-295 aircraft were manufactured in Spain by a Defence & Space
subsidiary. Certain ITAR-controlled defense articles from U.S. suppliers were component parts of
the C-295. When these items were exported from the United States to Spain, the U.S. suppliers
were responsible for filing an export license application with the DDTC. Depending on the
circumstance, the export license application would list either the Airbus subsidiary in Spain or an
identified customer as the end user of the defense article. In instances where Airbus was listed as
the end user, Airbus would eventually complete the production of the C-295 and sell it to a later-
identified Airbus customer. In those cases, Airbus was responsible for filing a subsequent export
license application with the DDTC, informing the DDTC that Airbusâs customer would be the new
end user for the defense article (hereinafter âre-export license applicationsâ). As part of those re-
export license applications, Airbus included statements regarding the applicability of ITAR Part
130 to the re-export (hereinafter âPart 130 certificationsâ or âcertificationsâ). Airbus repeatedly
filed re-export license applications with the DDTC relating to C-295s that included false or
incomplete certifications related to ITAR Part 130, as well as re-export license applications that
failed to include any certifications about ITAR Part 130.

Ghana

132. Airbus completed two campaigns to sell C-295 aircraft to the Republic of Ghana
(âGhanaâ) in 2009 and 2015, resulting in the sale of three C-295s during this period, two of which
were the subject of false ITAR Part 130 certifications and for one of which there was no application
filed because the re-export did not meet the requirements of ITAR Part 130. Several Airbus senior
executives from Airbus Defence & Space were directly involved in the Ghana sales campaign.

133. The first contract between Airbus and Ghana was signed on August 3, 2011, selling

two C-295s. Airbus delivered the two aircraft on November 17, 2011, and March 19, 2012,
A-36

 
Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 67 of 104

respectively. Airbus filed ITAR license applications with the DDTC for the transfer of the defense
articles in these two C-295s to Ghana under license numbers GC 2715-11 (approved November
30, 2011) and GC 2020-12 (approved August 30, 2012). In those license applications, Airbus
stated that the transaction met the requirements of 22 C.F.R. Â§ 130.2 and asserted that Airbus and
its Vendors had not paid, offered, or agreed to pay political contributions, fees, or commissions in
connection with the sale. The applications were signed by export compliance management (Airbus
Export Compliance Employee 2) at the Defence & Space Divisionâs Spanish subsidiary.

134. In fact, Airbus or its Vendors had paid, offered, or agreed to pay political
contributions, fees, or commissions in connection with these sales in the amount of at least
3,596,523 Euros.

135. Between 2009 and 2016, Individual 1, a citizen of Ghana, was a high-ranking
elected government official in Ghana during the relevant ITAR time period. Beginning in or
around 2009, a few months after Individual 1 took office, Individual 1 was in direct and repeated
contact with senior Airbus executives from both the Defence & Space Division and SMO
International about Airbus sales campaigns. Individual | was influential in having the Government
of Ghana approve aircraft purchases and Individual 1 contacted Airbus senior executives during
the government approval process. In 2011, during Individual 1âs time in office, the Ghanaian
Parliament approved the purchase of two C-295 aircraft.

136. In connection with the sales to Ghana, beginning on or about January 1, 2009, the
Defence & Space Divisionâs Spanish subsidiary contracted with Individual 1âs brother, Consultant
4, a citizen of Ghana and the United Kingdom, to act as a third-party consultant for Airbus during
the C-295 sales campaigns. Airbus purposefully sought to engage Consultant 4 due to his closeness

to Individual 1, and Airbus management included Consultant 4 in their communications with
A-37

 
Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 68 of 104

Individual 1. Airbus used Consultant 4 as a conduit for messages intended for Individual 1.
Consultant 4 traded on his access to Individual 1.

137. Consultant 5, a citizen of the United Kingdom, worked in conjunction with
Consultant 4 to assist in the sale. Consultant 4 and Consultant 5 initially were engaged by Airbus
without any written business partner agreement and without Airbus completing due diligence.

138. Airbus initially agreed to pay Consultant 4 through a company owned by
Consultant 4 and Consultant 5, in excess of 3,500,000 Euros for the Ghana C-295 sales campaign.
Airbus worked with Consultant 4 and Consultant 5 for two years before submitting a business
partner application to Airbusâs compliance staff.

139, In October 2011, Airbusâs compliance staff rejected the proposed contract between
Airbus and Consultant 4 and Consultant 5âs company because Consultant 4 had a familial
relationship to Individual 1. Specifically, Airbus compliance staff found that âthe shareholders of
this company are so close to the decision makers.â

140. Thereafter, due to the scrutiny of using Consultant 4 as a business partner, senior
leadership in SMO International and the Defence & Space Division concocted a plan to
deliberately circumvent Airbusâs compliance rules. Specifically, the Airbus executives proposed
to pay Consultant 4 via Organization 1. Organization 1 was a Spanish-based third-party business
partner of Airbus previously used on other Defence & Space campaigns. Organization 1 was in
good standing with SMO International. Organization | had no prior affiliation with Consultant 4
or Consultant 5. Airbus used Organization 1 solely as a pass-through entity to obscure the
involvement and payment of Consultant 4 in sales transactions; Organization 1 did not undertake
any third-party business partner activity in Ghana in connection with the 2011 campaign to sell

two C-295 aircraft to the Government of Ghana.
A-38

 
Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 69 of 104

141. Under this scheme, on March 20, 2012, Airbus entered into a contract with
Organization | to provide business partner services on the C-295 Ghana campaign. Although the
agreement was signed on March 20, 2012, it stated that the effective date for the contract was
January 1, 2010. The agreement was signed by Airbus Defence & Space management. The
agreement noted that Organization 1âs âoperational addressâ was in Ghana, despite the fact that
Organization | was operating in Spain. Under the agreement, Organization 1 would be provided a
success fee for the C-295 aircraft sale. The success fee was calculated to be approximately
3,001,718 Euros, a similar amount to that previously promised to Consultant 4 (3,500,000 Euros).

142. Pursuant to the agreement, between March 2012 and February 2014, Airbus paid
in excess of 3,500,000 Euros to Organization 1 in Spain. The payments on this contract were
authorized by SMO International.

143. Thereafter, Organization | transferred money to the account of the company owned
by Consultant 4 and Consultant 5. Organization 1 took a percentage of the money prior to the
transfer. In total, the company owned by Consultant 4 and Consultant 5 was paid in excess of
1,800,000 Euros in May 2012, related to the 2011 sale of two C-295s. Consultant 4 later claimed
71,393 Euros was still owed to him related to this sale.

144. In February 2014, Airbus management at SMO International and the Defence &
Space Division sought to extend Airbusâs contract with Organization 1, related to a subsequent
campaign to sell C-295 aircraft to Ghana. Airbusâs compliance staff rejected the extension request
and required that a new contract be signed. In March 2015, a request was submitted for
Organization | to be paid 1,665,000 Euros for the 2015 sale of one C-295 aircraft to Ghana, In the
request, it was noted that Organization | was âinvolved in previous sellings [sic],â but noted that

no contract had been signed with Organization 1.
A-39

 
Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 70 of 104

145. Consultant 4 subsequently demanded from both Airbus and Organization 1
payment of 1,675,000 Euros in connection with the 2015 C-295 sale.

146. Additionally, on or about March 28, 2012, Airbus made political contributions in
the amount of 62,200 Euros to a Spanish foundation related to agricultural development in Ghana.
This contribution was not initially disclosed on GC 2715-11 or GC 2020-12. Airbus subsequently
disclosed the same to the State Department out of abundance of caution, as no direct link between
these political contributions and the relevant C-295 sales has been identified to date.

Indonesia

147. In or around 2010 through in or around 2015, Airbus entities attempted to sell C-
295 military aircraft to Indonesia, resulting in the sale of eleven C-295s during this period, nine of
which were the subject of false ITAR Part 130 certifications. Executives from the Defence & Space
Division were directly involved in the sales campaigns. The sales campaign also involved
executives from SMO International, including Airbus Executive 3, with respect to engagement of
third-party business partners in Indonesia.

148. The first contract, which involved the sale of nine C-295s, was signed on February
15, 2012. Airbus filed an application with the DDTC for the transfer of the defense articles in these
nine C-295s to Indonesia under license numbers GC 2106-12 (approved August 20, 2012), GC
2015-12 (approved September 17, 2012), GC 3713-12 (approved January 28, 2013), GC 3773-13
(approved January 28, 2013), GC 0397-12 (approved March 5, 2013), GC 2218-13 (approved
August 23, 2013), GC 3459-13 (approved November 26, 2013), GC 0419-14 (approved March 6,
2014), GC 0221-14 (approved March 14, 2014), and GC 0843-14 (approved April 28, 2014). With
one exception (GC 2218-13), Part 130 applied to these applications and in them, Airbus either

made no statement regarding 22 C.F.R. Â§ 130, or stated that the transaction met the requirements
A-40

 
Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 71 of 104

of 22 C.F.R. Â§ 130.2 and asserted that Airbus and its Vendors had not paid, offered, or agreed to
pay political contributions, fees, or commissions in connection with the sale. The ITAR license
applications were signed by Airbus Export Compliance Employee 2, an export compliance
manager from the Defence & Space subsidiary in Spain.

149. In fact, Airbus or its Vendors had paid, offered, or agreed to pay political
contributions, fees, or commissions in connection with these sales, in the amount of approximately
16,100,000 Euros.

150. Organization 2 was an Indonesian consultant company. Organization 2âs founder
claimed to have connections to Indonesiaâs political leadership. Organization 2 had a highly
complex ownership structure, in which shares in the company were owned by groups of
shareholders that included holding companies for additional shareholders. Organization 2
employed numerous former Indonesian high-ranking military and government officials.

151. Organization 2 worked for both Airbusâs Commercial and Defence & Space
Division in Indonesia. Organization 2 began working for Airbus military aircraft campaigns in and
around 2010 on the basis of an oral agreement. Altogether, Airbus paid Organization 2 more than
14,000,000 Euros in connection with military aircraft sales in Indonesia.

152. Airbusâs relationship with Organization 2 was directly overseen by SMO
International, including oversight by Airbus Executive 3. Specifically, with respect to
Organization 2âs engagement on military aircraft campaigns in Indonesia, Airbus Executive 3
reviewed and approved the contracts between Airbus and Organization 2. Airbus approved
contracts with Organization 2 despite being told about compliance risks about Organization 2âs
existence, including that Organization 2âs business address listed no sign of the company and that

Organization 2âs office space appeared partially vacant and generally unused. Organization 2 was
A-41

 
Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 72 of 104

at times listed among the most frequently used business partners for SMO International. SMO
International executives, including Airbus Executives 2 and 3, and executives from the Defence &
Space Division met together with representatives from Organization 2 in June 2011 to discuss
sales of C-295s to Indonesia.

153. On February 20, 2012, after the sale of the C-295s to Indonesia was consummated,
the Defence & Space Division submitted to Airbus compliance an application for Organization 2
to assist on the sales campaign, which by that time was already completed. On June 15, 2012, the
agreement was approved and finalized, in which Airbus agreed to pay Organization 2 in connection
with the sale of nine C-295s to the Indonesian Ministry of Defense, for use by the Indonesian Air
Force. Airbus paid Organization 2 approximately 4,357,446 Euros under the agreement.

154. In addition, Airbus promised to pay 11,200,000 Euros to Organization 3 in
connection with the same sale. Organization 3 was an Indonesian based-business partner. Airbus
entered into two agreements with Organization 3: (i) one on July 3, 2012, the day before the sale
was consummated; and (ii) one on July 27, 2012, both in relation to the sale of nine C-295 aircrafts
and related technical and administrative support. Airbusâs relationship with Organization 3 was
also overseen by SMO International.

155. Airbus paid Organization 3 a total of 9,147,093 Euros in connection with these
agreements for the C-295 campaign.

Vietnam

156. In or around 2009 through in or around 2014, Airbus attempted to sell C-295

military aircraft to the country of Vietnam, resulting in the sale of three C-295s during this period,

all of which were the subject of false ITAR Part 130 certifications. Senior Airbus executives from

A-42

 
Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 73 of 104

the Defence & Space Division were directly involved in the Vietnam C-295 sales campaign, and
there was some involvement of executives from SMO International.

157. The aircraft contract between Airbus and the Vietnamese Ministry of Defense was
signed on December 17, 2013, selling three C-295s. Airbus filed an ITAR license application with
the DDTC for the transfer of the defense articles in these three C-295s to Vietnam, under license
number GC 2015-14 (approved August 26, 2014). In that application, Airbus stated that the
transaction met the requirements of 22 C.F.R. Â§ 130.2 and asserted that Airbus and its Vendors
had not paid, offered, or agreed to pay political contributions, fees, or commissions in connection
with the sale. The ITAR license application was signed by Airbus Export Compliance Employee
2, an export compliance manager at the Defence & Space subsidiary in Spain.

158. In fact, Airbus or its Vendors had paid, offered, or agreed to pay political
contributions, fees, or commissions in connection with these sales, in the amount of 6,150,226
Euros.

159. Organization 4 was a Hong Kong company doing business in Vietnam. Consultant
6, Consultant 7, and Consultant 8, all foreign nationals, were the controlling partners of
Organization 4. Consultant 7 had long-standing personal connections with senior Vietnamese
government officials as well as airline executives.

160. Organization 4 began working for Airbus in or around 2002. Organization 4
commenced work for Airbus on commercial aircraft campaigns based on an oral agreement. Later,
between October 2002 and July 2014, Airbus entered into numerous agreements with Organization
4 related to sales campaigns for Airbus commercial, defense, and helicopter products. However,
in general, most consultant agreements between Organization 4 and Airbus were entered into

retrospectively, following the success of a particular sales campaign.
A-43

 
Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 74 of 104

161. Airbusâs relationship with Organization 4 was directly overseen by SMO
International, including oversight by Airbus Executive 3. Specifically, Airbus Executive 3
reviewed and approved the contracts between Airbus Defence & Space and Organization 4.
Consultant 6 was at times listed among the most frequently used business partners for SMO
International.

162. On December 20, 2013, after the sale of the C-295s to Vietnam was consummated,
Airbus entered into an agreement by which it agreed to pay Organization 4 a success fee,
equivalent to 6,150,226 Euros, in connection with the successful C-295 sales campaigns in
Vietnam. Airbus paid at least 2,935,541 Euros under this agreement.

163. Airbusâs gross gain on the sales of the aforementioned C-295s to Ghana, Indonesia,
and Vietnam on which Airbus failed to file or falsely filed Part 130 disclosures was approximately
$165,208,895.

Eurofighter

164. During the relevant ITAR time period, Airbus manufactured Eurofighter Typhoon
aircraft, which were twin-engine fighter jets, together with two partners as part of a joint venture.
Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft manufactured by Airbus and its partners generally included defense
articles and were subject to regulation under the ITAR.

165. Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft were manufactured by a joint venture company
located in Germany, in which Airbus and two other companies each held shares. Certain ITAR-
controlled defense articles from U.S. suppliers were component parts of the Eurofighter Typhoon
aircraft.

166. Pursuant to an agreement between the joint venture member companies, each

company was responsible for sales over a geographic region. Under the agreement, the company
A-44

 
Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 75 of 104

responsible for the sale was responsible for filing the appropriate ITAR license applications with
the DDTC. Regarding disclosures under ITAR Part 130, in addition to accounting for its own
offers, agreements, or payments of political contributions, fees, or commissions in connection with
a sale, the company responsible for the sale was also responsible for gathering information from
the other joint venture member companies about any political contributions, fees, or commissions
offered, agreed, or paid by those companies.

167. Under the agreement between the joint venture member companies, Airbus
contributed to sales efforts in Austria, among other locations, in support of the joint venture
company.

168. Beginning in or around 2000, Airbus conducted a sales campaign to sell Eurofighter
Typhoon aircraft and related services to the Austrian Ministry of Defense, resulting in the eventual
sale of fifteen Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft and equipment and services related thereto during this
period, all of which contained ITAR-controlled content, and involved false ITAR applications.
SMO International managed at least one of the business partners involved in this sale.

169. The contract between the joint venture company and the Austrian Ministry of
Defence was signed in 2003, and later amended in 2007, selling fifteen Eurofighter Typhoon
aircraft. Additionally, contracts related to equipment, services, and support of the Eurofighter
Typhoon aircraft were signed in 2003, 2007, and 2011. Airbus filed an ITAR license application
with the DDTC for the transfer of the defense articles in these fifteen Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft
to Austria and the accompanying service agreements, under license number GC 0819-13 (approved
May 31, 2013). In GC 0819-13, Airbus made no statements regarding the requirements of 22
C.F.R. Â§ 130.2. GC 0819-13 was signed by senior export compliance management as well as a

senior sales manager.
A-45

 
Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 76 of 104

170. In fact, Airbus or its Vendors had paid, offered, or agreed to pay political
contributions, fees, or commissions, as defined in ITAR Part 130, in connection with the sale, in
the amount of approximately 55,125,984 Euros.

171. In total, Airbus made payments to fourteen individuals, consultants, or
organizations that should have been reported under Part 130. Of particular note:

a. Consultant 9 was a consultant in Austria, hired by Airbus in connection with the

Eurofighter Typhoon Austrian sales campaign. Between April 2002 and December
2009, Airbus paid 16,895,467 Euros to Consultant 9, plus a success fee equivalent
to 2,750,000 Euros.

b. Organization 5 was an Austrian company whose principal held a close familial
connection to an Austrian government official. Both the principal and the Austrian
government official were good friends of Consultant 9. On behalf of Airbus,
Consultant 9 paid 87,600 Euros to Organization 5 for the development of an
airshow. |

c, Organization 6 was an Austrian company and a third-party business partner of
Airbus. In 2011, pursuant to a consultant agreement, Airbus paid 3,097,226 Euros
to Organization 6 in connection with the Austria Eurofighter campaign. Airbusâs
relationship with Organization 6 was directly overseen by SMO International.

Part 129 Non-Compliance

172. During the relevant ITAR time period, Airbus employed the services of hundreds
of third-party business partners to facilitate the manufacture, export, permanent import, transfer,
re-export, or retransfer of aircraft and other platforms that contained ITAR-controlled defense

articles. The business partners engaged in brokering activities while receiving fees and
A-46

 
Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 77 of 104

commissions from Airbus that were not disclosed in brokering reports, as required under ITAR
Section 129.10.

173. As previously described, between December 1, 2011, and October 24, 2013, the
ITAR required business partners who engaged in brokering activities involving ITAR-controlled
defense articles or defense services to register with DDTC. Between October 25, 2013, and
December 1, 2016, the ITAR required business partners with a U.S. nexus engaged in sales of
ITAR-controlled defense articles and defense services to register with the DDTC. A number of
Airbusâs business partners failed to register as brokers as required by ITAR Part 129.

174. Despite these requirements, Airbus did not have an adequate process in place to
ensure that its business partners that engaged in sales of ITAR-controlled defense articles and
defense services were registered as brokers with the DDTC and filed reports with the DDTC.
Airbus also failed to confirm whether these business partners were properly registered with DDTC
prior to engaging or paying these business partners to work on sales campaigns involving ITAR-
controlled products or services. Airbus nonetheless paid these brokers to facilitate sales of ITAR-
controlled defense articles and defense services. As such, Airbusâs conduct, while not âknowing[]â
or âwillful[]â, nonetheless, thus âcause[d], aid[ed], abet[ted], . . . or permit[ed]â the business
partnersâ unauthorized brokering of defense articles or defense services. See 22 C.F.R. Â§ 127.1(e).

175. Consultant 10 was a Thai national, whom Airbus hired as a business partner to work
on campaigns to sell Airbus products, including products containing ITAR-controlled defense
articles and defense services, to the Government of Thailand and various Thai Armed Forces,
Consultant 10 was specifically identified by Airbus Executive 3 as an appropriate business partner

for Thailand because of his connections to Thai government officials. Consultant 10 was

A-47

 
Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 78 of 104

designated by SMO International as one of its most frequently used business partners. Airbusâs
relationship with Consultant 10 was managed by SMO International.

176. Consultant 10 was not registered as a broker with the DDTC between 2008 and
October 25, 2013. Airbus did not screen Consultant 10 to ensure compliance with 22 C.F.R.
Â§ 129.2, .3, & .10, or require Consultant 10 to show proof of broker registration with the DDTC.

177. Between 2008 and October 25, 2013, Consultant 10 worked for Airbus on various
campaigns to sell Airbus helicopters to various Thai government entities, to include the Royal Thai
Army, Royal Thai Navy, Royal Thai Air Force, Royal Thai Police, and Royal Thai Survey
Department. Many of these campaigns were for sales of Airbus helicopters that may have included
ITAR-controlled products, to include the EC120, EC155, EC725, AS365, and AS550 models,
During the relevant time period, at least approximately 28,595,000 Euros was promised or paid in
relation to sales between 2008 and October 25, 2013 (i.e., the time period in which registration
was required) of Airbus products that may have contained ITAR-controlled parts or technology.
Airbus paid Consultant 10 approximately 9,645,735 Euros for his brokering services in connection
with helicopter and defense campaigns. Airbusâs payments to Consultant 10 facilitated Consultant
10âs violation of ITAR Part 129.

Part 129.7 and 126.1 Non-Compliance

178. Airbus also failed to implement policies and procedures to ensure that no business
partners who engaged in brokering activity on its behalf were nationals of or incorporated in
countries listed in ITAR Part 126.1, which prohibits the sale of defense articles and defense
services to any listed Prohibited Country or a person from any listed Prohibited Country acting on
its behalf without written approval of the DDTC. During the relevant ITAR time period, Airbus

employed a number of business partners from Prohibited Countries listed in Part 126 who engaged
A-48

 
Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 79 of 104

Group NV, and Airbus Group NV became the parent company. In or about May 2015, Airbus
Group NV changed its name to Airbus Group SE, and Airbus Group SE became the parent
company. In or about April 2017, Airbus Group SE changed its name to Airbus SE, and the
defendant Airbus SE became the parent company. Airbus SE is the lawful successor-in-interest to

EADS NV, Airbus Group NV, and Airbus Group SE.

 
Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 96 of 104

8. During the relevant period, Airbusâs business was organized into divisions. The
structure changed and was progressively simplified over the period, but there were broadly three
divisions: (i) the Commercial Division, which handled, among other things, the manufacture and
sale of civilian aircraft to airlines; (ii) the Defence & Space Division, which handled, among other
things, the manufacture and sale of military aircraft, satellites, unmanned aerial systems, and other
products and services used by governmental agencies; and (iii) the Helicopters Division, which
handled the manufacture and sale of helicopters and related equipment and services.

9. As set out in more detail in the Statement of Facts, attached as Exhibit A and
incorporated herein by reference, the AECA authorized the President to control, among other things,
the export of defense articles deemed critical to the national security and foreign policy interests of
the United States. By Executive Order 13637, the President delegated this authority to the United
States Department of State, Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (âDDTCâ), empowering DDTC
to review and grant export licenses for the transfer or retransfer of defense articles and defense
services identified on the United States Munitions List (âUSMLâ). DDTC is located in the District
of Columbia. Pursuant to its authority under AECA, DDTC promulgated the International Traffic
in Arms Regulations (âITARâ), 22 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 120-130, which contained the USML. Accordingly,

the export of USML defense articles and defense services is governed by the AECA and ITAR.

10. Airbus designed, manufactured, and sold certain products containing âdefense
articlesâ and furnished certain âdefense services,â as defined in 22 C.F.R. Â§ 120.6 and 120.9,
respectively, which were controlled by the AECA and ITAR. Generally, these products were sold
by Airbusâs Defence & Space and Helicopters Divisions. Between on or about December 1, 2011,
and continuing through on or about December 1, 2016 (âthe relevant ITAR time periodâ), Airbus

violated U.S. law related to the sale of ITAR controlled defense articles and furnishing of defense

E-3

 
Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 97 of 104

services by:

a. Paying political contributions, fees, and commissions in association with the sale of
ITAR-controlled defense articles or defense services and failing to report the same
to the DDTC, as required by 22 C.F.R. Â§ 130; and

b. Failing to keep records related to the sales of ITAR-controlled defense articles or
defense services for a period of not less than five years, as required by 22 C.F.R.
Â§ 130.14.

11. Pursuant to the AECA, 22 U.S.C. Â§ 2279, and the ITAR, 22 C.F.R. Â§ 130.9, certain
Applicants (as defined in 22 C.F.R. Â§ 130.2) applying for export licenses were required to inform
DDTC as to whether the Applicant or its Vendors (as defined in 22 C.F.R. Â§ 130.8) had paid,
offered, or agreed to pay political contributions, fees, or commissions in connection with the sale
or transfer of a defense article or defense service. The purpose of this provision was to provide
Executive Branch oversight of the sale of U.S. military technology and prevent âimproper
influenceâ in those sales. H.R. REP. 94-1144, 58, 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1378, 1434. Under these
provisions, for defense articles or defense services valued in an amount of $500,000 or more that
are sold commercially to or for the use of the Armed Forces of a foreign country or international
organization (as defined in 22 C.F.R. Â§ 130.3), an Applicant must report to the DDTC any payments
or agreements to pay (i) political contributions of $5,000 or more, and (ii) fees and commissions of

$100,000 or more. 22 C.F.R. Â§ 130.1, 2.

- 12, Airbus had knowledge of its requirements of ITAR Part 130. Airbusâs willful
violations of ITAR Part 130, were the result of several factors, including: Airbusâs ongoing use of
business partners in its sales of ITAR-controlled defense articles and defense services; willful
efforts and reluctance by certain Airbus employees to prevent disclosure of the business partner

E-4

 
Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 98 of 104

relationships and payments; Airbus structuring the compliance function as separate and siloed
from business sales, and the export compliance function, which prevented accurate ITAR
compliance; and Airbus failing to provide adequate training about ITAR Part 130 for its
employees. Asa result, with respect to Part 130, Airbus willfully failed to report or under-reported
political contributions, fees, and commissions to the DDTC.

13. Had political contributions, commissions, and fees paid by Airbus been properly
reported to the DDTC as part of Airbusâs ITAR filings, such disclosure could have triggered
oversight by DDTC and other agencies, including in the form of a referral by DDTC to law
enforcement,

14. If the DDTC knew that Airbus willfully submitted applications that contained
inaccurate or incomplete ITAR Part 130 certifications, the DDTC would not have approved the
relevant license applications.

Vietnam Conduct

15. In or around 2009 through in or around 2014, Airbus attempted to sell C-295
military aircraft to the country of Vietnam, resulting in the sale of three C-295s during this period,
all of which were the subject of false ITAR Part 130 certifications. Senior Airbus executives from
the Defence & Space Division were directly involved in the Vietnam C-295 sales campaign and

there was some involvement of executives from SMO International.

16. The aircraft contract between Airbus and the Vietnamese Ministry of Defense was
signed on December 17, 2013, selling three C-295s. Airbus filed an ITAR license application with
the DDTC for the transfer of the defense articles in these three C-295s to Vietnam, under license
number GC 2015-14 (approved August 26, 2014). In that application, Airbus stated that the

transaction met the requirements of 22 C.F.R. Â§ 130.2 and asserted that Airbus and its Vendors had

E-5

 
Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 99 of 104

not paid, offered, or agreed to pay political contributions, fees, or commissions in connection with
the sale. The ITAR license application was signed by Airbus Export Compliance Employee 2, an
export compliance manager at the Defence & Space subsidiary in Spain.

17. In fact, Airbus or its Vendors had paid, offered, or agreed to pay political
contributions, fees, or commissions in connection with these sales, in the amount of 6,150,226 Euros.

18. Organization 4 was a Hong Kong company doing business in Vietnam. Consultant 6,
Consultant 7, and Consultant 8, all foreign nationals, were the controlling partners of Organization
4. Consultant 7 had long-standing personal connections with senior Vietnamese government
officials as well as airline executives.

19. Organization 4 began working for Airbus in or around 2002. Organization 4
commenced work for Airbus on commercial aircraft campaigns based on an oral agreement. Later,
between October 2002 and July 2014, Airbus entered into numerous agreements with Organization 4
related to sales campaigns for Airbus commercial, defense, and helicopter products. However, in
general, most consultant agreements between Organization 4 and Airbus were entered into

retrospectively, following the success of a particular sales campaign.

20. Airbusâs relationship with Organization 4 was directly overseen by SMO
International, including oversight by Airbus Executive 3. Specifically, Airbus Executive 3 reviewed
and approved the contracts between Airbus Defence & Space and Organization 4. Consultant 6 was
at times listed among the most-frequently used business partners for SMO International.

21. On December 20, 2013, after the sale of the C-295s to Vietnam was consummated,
Airbus entered into an agreement by which it agreed to pay Organization 4 a success fee, equivalent
to 6,150,226 Euros, in connection with the successful C-295 sales campaigns in Vietnam. Airbus
paid at least 2,935,541 Euros under this agreement.

Tracing of Defendant Property

 

The proceeds of the 2013 C-295 sale to Vietnam are traced as follows:

. Airbusâs first date of receipt for the aircraft sale was on April 14, 2014 for 30,75 1,146

Euros. Airbusâs last date of receipt for the aircraft sale was on May 17, 2015 for
14,833,837 Euros. Airbus received various interim payments between the first and
last date of receipt to exceed 50,000,000 Euros in amount paid.

The payments were made to an Airbus Defence & Space, Spain (âAirbus D&S
Spainâ) EUR bank account.

The Airbus D&S Spain EUR bank account was then swept as part of a zero balance
automatic cash pooling policy into an Airbus SE EUR pooling account. Funds from
other Airbus group entities were also paid into this pooling account.

This Airbus SE EUR pooling account was then used for the redistribution of funds to
all relevant Airbus entities within the pooling agreement based upon their cash
requirements at the time. Furthermore, those funds not required by other Airbus
entities were then manually transferred into an Airbus SE EUR Master Pooling
Account.

From the Airbus SE EUR Master Pooling Account, excess cash was invested into a
money market fund or bonds (the âInvestment Accountâ) or manually transferred
back to the Airbus SE EUR pooling account, should the operational need arise. The
Investment Account is where a bond worth 50,000,000 Euros that commenced on
April 16, 2014 is located.

Airbus has agreed that the Defendant Property is property which constitutes

proceeds traceable to its violation of the AECA and the ITAR, and is subject to forfeiture pursuant

E-7

 
Case 1:20-cr-00021-TFH Document 8 Filed 01/31/20 Page 101 of 104

to 18U.S.C. Â§ 981(a)(1)(C).

CLAIM FOR RELIEF
(18 U.S.C. Â§ 981(a)(1)(Â©)

24. The Government re-alleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 23
as if fully set forth herein.

25. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Â§ 981(a)(1)(C), any property, real or personal, constituting or
derived from proceeds traceable to a violation of AECA, is subject to forfeiture.

26. As a result, the Defendant Property is subject to forfeiture to the United States
pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Â§ 981(a)(1)(C) as property which constitutes proceeds traceable to Airbusâs
violation of the AECA and the ITAR.

REQUEST FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, the plaintiff United States of America prays that process issue to enforce
the forfeiture of the in rem Defendant Property; that, pursuant to law, notice be provided to all
interested parties to appear and show cause why the forfeited Defendant Property be condemned as
forfeited to the United States of America; and for such other and further relief as this Court may

deem just, necessary and proper, together with the costs and disbursements of this action.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Friday, January 31, 2020

Airbus Agrees to Pay over $3.9 Billion in Global Penalties to Resolve Foreign Bribery and ITAR
Case

Airbus SE (Airbus or the Company), a global provider of civilian and military aircraft based in France, has agreed to pay combined penalties of
more than $3.9 billion to resolve foreign bribery charges with authorities in the United States, France and the United Kingdom arising out of the
Companyâs scheme to use third-party business partners to bribe government officials, as well as non-governmental airline executives, around
the world and to resolve the Companyâs violation of the Arms Export Control Act (AECA) and its implementing regulations, the International
Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), in the United States. This is the largest global foreign bribery resolution to date.

Airbus entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the department in connection with a criminal information filed on Jan. 28, 2020 in
the District of Columbia charging the Company with conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery provision of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA)
and conspiracy to violate the AECA and its implementing regulations, the ITAR. The FCPA charge arose out of Airbusâs scheme to offer and pay
bribes to foreign officials, including Chinese officials, in order to obtain and retain business, including contracts to sell aircraft. The AECA charge
stems from Airbusâs willful failure to disclose political contributions, commissions or fees to the U.S. government, as required under the ITAR, in
connection with the sale or export of defense articles and defense services to the Armed Forces of a foreign country or international
organization. The case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Thomas F. Hogan of the District of Columbia.

âAirbus engaged in a multi-year and massive scheme to corruptly enhance its business interests by paying bribes in China and other countries
and concealing those bribes,â said Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division. âThis
coordinated resolution was possible thanks to the dedicated efforts of our foreign partners at the Serious Fraud Office in the United Kingdom
and the PNF in France. The Department will continue to work aggressively with our partners across the globe to root out corruption, particularly
corruption that harms American interests.â

âInternational corruption involving sensitive U.S. defense technology presents a particularly dangerous combination. Todayâs announcement
demonstrates the Departmentâs continuing commitment to ensuring that those who violate our export control laws are held to account,â said
Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General David P. Burns of the Justice Departmentâs National Security Division (NSD). âThe resolution,
however, also reflects the significant benefits available under NSDâs revised voluntary self-disclosure policy for companies that choose to self-
report export violations, cooperate, and remediate as to those violations, even where there are aggravating circumstances. We hope other
companies will make the same decision as Airbus to report potential criminal export violations timely and directly to NSD so that they too can
avail themselves of the policyâs benefits.â

âToday, Airbus has admitted to a years-long campaign of corruption around the world, said U.S. Attorney Jessie K. Liu of the District of
Columbia. âThrough bribes, Airbus allowed rampant corruption to invade the U.S. system. Additionally, Airbus falsely reported information
about their conduct to the U.S. government for more than five years in order to gain valuable licenses to export U.S. military technology. This
case exemplifies the ability of our prosecutors and law enforcement to work with our foreign counterparts to ensure that corruption around the
world is prevented and punished at the highest levels.â

âAirbus SE, the second largest Aerospace company world-wide, engaged in a systematic and deliberate conspiracy, that knowingly and willfully
violated U.S. fraud and export laws,â said Special Agent in Charge Peter C. Fitzhugh of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcementâs Homeland
Security Investigations (HSI) New York. âAirbusâs fraud and bribery in commercial aircraft transactions strengthened corrupt airlines and bad
actors worldwide, at the expense of straightforward enterprises. Additionally, the bribery of government officials, specifically those involved in
the procurement of U.S. military technology, posed a national security threat to both the U.S. and its allies. The global threats facing the U.S.
have never been greater than they are today, and HSI New York is committed to working with our federal and international partners to assure
sensitive U.S. technologies are not unlawfully and fraudulently acquired. As this investigation reflects, national security continues to be a top
priority not just for Department of Homeland Security, but for HSI New York.â

The Companyâs payment to the United States will be $527 million for the FCPA and ITAR violations, and an additional 50 million Euros
(approximately $55 million) as part of a civil forfeiture agreement for the ITAR-related conduct, and the department will credit a portion of the
amount the Company pays to the Parquet National Financier (PNF) in France under the Companyâs agreement with the PNF. In addition, the
Company has agreed to pay a $10 million penalty to the U.S. Department of Stateâs Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC), of which the
department is crediting $5 million. In related proceedings, the Company settled with the PNF in France over bribes paid to government officials
and non-governmental airline executives in China and multiple other countries and the Company has agreed to pay more than 2 billion Euros
(more than approximately $2.29 billion) pursuant to the PNF agreement. As part of this coordinated global resolution, the Company also
entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the United Kingdomâs Serious Fraud Office (SFO) over bribes paid in Malaysia, Sri Lanka,
Taiwan, Indonesia and Ghana, and the Company has agreed to pay approximately 990 million Euros equivalent (approximately $1.09 billion)
pursuant to the SFO agreement. The PNF and SFO had investigated the Company as part of a Joint Investigative Team.

According to admissions and court documents, beginning in at least 2008 and continuing until at least 2015, Airbus engaged in and facilitated a
scheme to offer and pay bribes to decision makers and other influencers, including to foreign officials, in order to obtain improper business
advantages and to win business from both privately owned enterprises and entities that were state-owned and state-controlled. In furtherance
of the corrupt bribery scheme, Airbus employees and agents, among other things, sent emails while located in the United States and
participated in and provided luxury travel to foreign officials within the United States.
The admissions and court documents establish that in order to conceal and to facilitate the bribery scheme, Airbus engaged certain business
partners, in part, to assist in the bribery scheme. Between approximately 2013 and 2015, Airbus engaged a business partner in China and
knowingly and willfully conspired to make payments to the business partner that were intended to be used as bribes to government officials in
China in connection with the approval of certain agreements in China associated with the purchase and sale of Airbus aircraft to state-owned
and state-controlled airlines in China. In order to conceal the payments and to conceal its engagement of the business partner in China, Airbus
did not pay the business partner directly but instead made payments to a bank account in Hong Kong in the name of a company controlled by
another business partner.

Pursuant to the AECA and ITAR, the DDTC regulates the export and import of U.S. defense articles and defense services, and prohibits their
export overseas without the requisite licensing and approval of the DDTC. According to admissions and court documents, between December
2011 and December 2016, Airbus filed numerous applications for the export of defense articles and defense services to foreign armed forces.
As part of its applications, Airbus was required under Part 130 of the ITAR to provide certain information related to political contributions, fees or
commissions paid in connection with the sale of defense articles or defense services. The admissions and court documents reveal, however,
that the Company engaged in a criminal conspiracy to knowingly and willfully violate the AECA and ITAR, by failing to provide DDTC with
accurate information related to commissions paid by Airbus to third-party brokers who were hired to solicit, promote or otherwise secure the
sale of defense articles and defense services to foreign armed forces.

As part of the deferred prosecution agreement with the department, Airbus has agreed to continue to cooperate with the department in any
ongoing investigations and prosecutions relating to the conduct, including of individuals, and to enhance its compliance program.

For the FCPA-related conduct, the department reached this resolution with Airbus based on a number of factors, including the Companyâs
cooperation and remediation. In addition, for the FCPA-related conduct, the U.S. resolution recognizes the strength of Franceâs and the United
Kingdomâs interests over the Companyâs corruption-related conduct, as well as the compelling equities of France and the United Kingdom to
vindicate their respective interests as those countries deem appropriate, and the department has taken into account these countriesâ
determination of the appropriate resolution into all aspects of the U.S. resolution.

With respect to the AECA and ITAR-related conduct, the department reached this resolution with Airbus based on the voluntary and timely
nature of its disclosure to the department as well as the Companyâs cooperation and remediation.

HSIâs New York Field Office Counter Proliferation Investigations Group is investigating the case. Deputy Chief Christopher Cestaro, Assistant
Chief Vanessa Sisti and Trial Attorney Elina A. Rubin Smith of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section, Deputy Chief Elizabeth L. D. Cannon and
Trial Attorney David Lim of the National Security Divisionâs Counterintelligence and Export Control Section, and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Michelle
Zamarin, Gregg Maisel, David Kent and Karen Seifert of the District of Columbia are prosecuting the case. The Criminal Division's Office of
International Affairs provided assistance.

The Department of Justice acknowledges and expresses its appreciation of the significant assistance provided by Franceâs Parquet National
Financier and the UKâs Serious Fraud Office.

The Fraud Section is responsible for all investigations and prosecutions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and conducts other investigations
into sophisticated economic crimes. The Counterintelligence and Export Control Section supervises the investigation and prosecution of cases
involving the export of military and strategic commodities and technology, including cases under the AECA and ITAR.

parent company, Alcon Inc., agree, however, that, in the event the Fraud Section and the Office
determine, in their sole discretion, that the Company or Alcon Inc. has knowingly violated any
provision of this Agreement or has failed to completely perform or fulfill each of the Companyâs
or Alcon Inc.âs obligations under this Agreement, an extension or extensions of the Term of the
Agreement may be imposed by the Fraud Section and the Office, in their sole discretion, for up to
a total additional time period of one year, without prejudice to the Fraud Sectionâs or the Officeâs
right to proceed as provided in Paragraphs 14 to 18 below. Any extension of the Agreement
extends all terms of this Agreement, including the terms of the reporting requirement in
Attachment D (the âReporting Requirementsâ), for an equivalent period. Conversely, in the event
the Fraud Section and the Office find, in their sole discretion, that there exists a change in
circumstances sufficient to eliminate the Reporting Requirements, and that the other provisions of
this Agreement have been satisfied, the Agreement may be terminated early. If the Court rejects
the Agreement, all provisions of the Agreement shall be deemed null and void, and the Term shall
be deemed to have not begun.

facts and circumstances presented by this case and by the Company and Alcon Inc., including:

FCPA Corporate Enforcement Policy in the Department of Justice Manual 9-47.120, or pursuant
to the United States Sentencing Guidelines (âU.S.S.G.â or âSentencing Guidelinesâ), because its

disclosure of the conduct described in the attached Statement of Facts was not timely, there was
an imminent threat of disclosure to the Fraud Section and the Office, and the Companyâs former
corporate parent, Novartis AG, was subject to reporting obligations under a prior resolution with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (âSECâ);

b. the Company received full credit for its cooperation, as well as Alcon Inc.âs
and Novartis AGâs cooperation, with the Fraud Sectionâs and the Officeâs investigation, including
conducting a thorough internal investigation; making regular factual presentations to the Fraud
Section and the Office; producing extensive documentation, including documents located outside
of the United States, after taking steps that the Company and its affiliates determined complied
with applicable foreign data privacy, confidentiality, and discovery laws; and providing
translations of foreign language documents;

C. the Company, Alcon Inc., and their former corporate parent companies and
affiliates engaged in remedial measures, including implementing enhanced policies and procedures
relating to, among other things, accounting, anti-corruption, payments to third parties, gifts, travel,
and entertainment; conducting internal reviews and investigations, including site visits, audits, and
risk assessments; working with outside counsel to conduct an extensive internal investigation of
the Companyâs operations in Asia; terminating high-level executives of the Company and
disciplining certain other employees of the Company and its affiliates; and terminating the
Companyâs relationship with the third-party distributor company involved in the conduct described
in the Statement of Facts;

d. the Company and Alcon Inc. have committed to continuing to enhance their

compliance programs and internal controls, including ensuring that their compliance programs

Compliance Programâ);

e. based on the Companyâs and Alcon Inc.âs remediation and the state of their
compliance programs, and the Companyâs and Alcon Inc.âs agreement to report to the Fraud
Section and the Office as set forth in the Reporting Requirements, the Fraud Section and the Office
determined that an independent compliance monitor is unnecessary;

f. Novartis AG, the Companyâs former parent company, has resolved with the
SEC through a cease-and-desist proceeding relating to the conduct described in the attached
Statement of Facts and other conduct, and has agreed to pay $92,300,000 in disgorgement and
prejudgment interest of $20,500,000;

g. the nature and seriousness of the offense conduct, as described in the
attached Statement of Facts, including the falsification of books, records, and accounts to conceal
improper payments to health care providers (âHCPsâ) employed by public institutions in Vietnam,
as well as the duration of the misconduct and the involvement of high-level executives of the
Company;

h. the Company has no prior criminal history;

1. the Company has agreed to continue to cooperate with the Fraud Section
and the Office in any ongoing investigation as described in Paragraph 5 below;

j. accordingly, after considering (a) through (1) above, the Company received
an aggregate discount of 25 percent off the bottom of the otherwise-applicable Sentencing

Guidelines fine range.

being investigated or prosecuted.

d. With respect to any information, testimony, documents, records, or other
tangible evidence provided to the Fraud Section and the Office pursuant to this Agreement, the

agree that this penalty is appropriate given the facts and circumstances of this case, including the
Relevant Considerations described in Paragraph 4 of this Agreement. The Total Criminal Fine is
final and shall not be refunded. Furthermore, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed an
agreement by the Fraud Section and the Office that the Total Criminal Fine is the maximum penalty
that may be imposed in any future prosecution, and the Fraud Section and the Office are not
precluded from arguing in any future prosecution that the Court should impose a higher fine,
although the Fraud Section and the Office agree that under those circumstances, they will

recommend to the Court that any amount paid under this Agreement should be offset against any
Case 2:20-cr-00539-SDW Document 2 Filed 06/25/20 Page 10 of 70 PagelD: 28

fine the Court imposes as part of a future judgment. The Company acknowledges that no tax

15
Case 2:20-cr-00539-SDW Document 2 Filed 06/25/20 Page 16 of 70 PagelD: 34

17. The Company and Alcon Inc. acknowledge that the Fraud Section and the Office
have made no representations, assurances, or promises concerning what sentence may be imposed

expires, the Company, by the Chief Executive Officer of the Company and the Chief Financial
Officer of the Company, will certify to the Fraud Section and the Office that the Company has met
its disclosure obligations pursuant to Paragraphs 5 and 6 of this Agreement. Each certification
will be deemed a material statement and representation by the Company to the executive branch
of the United States for purposes of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 1001 and 1519, and it
will be deemed to have been made in the judicial district in which this Agreement is filed.

Sale, Merger, or Other Change in Corporate Form of the Company

19. Except as may otherwise be agreed by the parties in connection with a particular
transaction, the Company and Alcon Inc. agree that in the event that, during the Term, the
Company or Alcon Inc. undertake any change in corporate form, including if it sells, merges, or
transfers business operations that are material to the Companyâs or Alcon Inc.âs consolidated
operations, or to the operations of any subsidiaries or affiliates involved in the conduct described
in the attached Statement of Facts, as they exist as of the date of this Agreement, whether such
change is structured as a sale, asset sale, merger, transfer, or other change in corporate form, it

shall include in any contract for sale, merger, transfer, or other change in corporate form a

provision binding the purchaser, or any successor in interest thereto, to the obligations described
in this Agreement. The purchaser or successor in interest must also agree in writing that the Fraud
Sectionâs and the Officeâs ability to declare a breach under this Agreement is applicable in full
force to that entity. The Company and Alcon Inc. agree that the failure to include these provisions
in the transaction will make any such transaction null and void. The Company and Alcon Inc.
shall provide notice to the Fraud Section and the Office at least thirty days prior to undertaking
any such sale, merger, transfer, or other change in corporate form. The Fraud Section and the
Office shall notify the Company and Alcon Inc. prior to such transaction (or series of transactions)
if they determine that the transaction(s) will have the effect of circumventing or frustrating the
enforcement purposes of this Agreement. If, at any time during the Term, the Company or Alcon
Inc. engages in a transaction(s) that has the effect of circumventing or frustrating the enforcement
purposes of this Agreement, the Fraud Section and the Office may deem it a breach of this
Agreement pursuant to Paragraphs 14 to 18 of this Agreement. Nothing herein shall restrict the
Company or Alcon Inc. from indemnifying (or otherwise holding harmless) the purchaser or
successor in interest for penalties or other costs arising from any conduct that may have occurred
prior to the date of the transaction, so long as such indemnification does not have the effect of
circumventing or frustrating the enforcement purposes of this Agreement, as determined by the
Fraud Section and the Office.

20. The Company and Alcon Inc. expressly agree that they shall not, through present
or future attorneys, officers, directors, employees, agents or any other person authorized to speak

the acceptance of responsibility by the Company or Alcon Inc. set forth above or the facts
described in the attached Statement of Facts. Any such contradictory statement shall, subject to
cure rights of the Company and Alcon Inc. described below, constitute a breach of this Agreement,
and the Company and/or Alcon Inc. thereafter shall be subject to prosecution as set forth in
Paragraphs 14 to 16 of this Agreement. The decision whether any public statement by any such
person contradicting a fact contained in the attached Statement of Facts will be imputed to the
Company and/or Alcon Inc. for the purpose of determining whether it has breached this Agreement
shall be at the sole discretion of the Fraud Section and the Office. If the Fraud Section and the
Office determine that a public statement by any such person contradicts in whole or in part a
statement contained in the attached Statement of Facts, the Fraud Section and the Office shall so
notify the Company and Alcon Inc., and the Company and Alcon Inc. may avoid a breach of this
Agreement by publicly repudiating such statement(s) within five business days after notification.

in other proceedings relating to the matters set forth in the attached Statement of Facts provided
that such defenses and claims do not contradict, in whole or in part, a statement contained in the
attached Statement of Facts. This Paragraph does not apply to any statement made by any present
or former officer, director, employee, or agent of the Company or Alcon Inc. in the course of any
criminal, regulatory, or civil case initiated against such individual, unless such individual is
speaking on behalf of the Company and/or Alcon Inc.

21. The Company and Alcon Inc. agree that if they or any of their direct or indirect
subsidiaries or affiliates issue a press release or hold any press conference in connection with this

Agreement, the Company and Alcon Inc. shall first consult with the Fraud Section and the Office

Case 2:20-cr-00539-SDW Document 2 Filed 06/25/20 Page 19 of 70 PagelD: 37

to determine: (a) whether the text of the release or proposed statements at the press conference are
true and accurate with respect to matters between the Fraud Section, the Office, the Company, and
Alcon Inc.; and (b) whether the Fraud Section and the Office have any objection to the release or
statement.

attention of law enforcement and regulatory authorities the facts and circumstances relating to the
nature of the conduct underlying this Agreement, including the nature and quality of the
Companyâs and Alcon Inc.âs cooperation and remediation. By agreeing to provide this information
to such authorities, the Fraud Section and the Office are not agreeing to advocate on behalf of the
Company, Alcon Inc., or their subsidiaries or affiliates, but rather are agreeing to provide facts to
be evaluated independently by such authorities. Nothing in this Agreement restricts in any way
the ability of the Fraud Section and the Office, any other federal department or agency, or any state
or local government, from proceeding criminally, civilly, or administratively, against any current
or former directors, officers, employees, or agents of the Company, Alcon Inc., its subsidiaries or
affiliates, or against any other entities or individuals. The parties to this Agreement intend that the
Agreement does not confer or provide any benefits, privileges, immunities, or rights to any other
individual or entity other than the parties hereto.

the Office, but specifically does not bind any other component of the Department of Justice, other

other authorities, although the Fraud Section and the Office will bring the cooperation of the

Company and Alcon Inc. and their compliance with their other obligations under this Agreement
to the attention of such agencies and authorities if requested to do so by the Company or Alcon
Inc.

ATTACHMENT A

STATEMENT OF FACTS

The following Statement of Facts is incorporated as part of the Deferred Prosecution
Agreement (the âAgreementâ) between the United States Department of Justice, Criminal
Division, Fraud Section (the âFraud Sectionâ), the United States Attorneyâs Office for the District
of New Jersey (the âOfficeââ), and Alcon Pte Ltd (the âCompanyâ). The Company hereby agrees
and stipulates that the following facts and conclusions of law are true and accurate. The Company
admits, accepts, and acknowledges that it is responsible for the acts of its officers, directors,
employees, and agents as set forth below. Should the Fraud Section and the Office pursue the
prosecution that is deferred by this Agreement, the Company agrees that it will neither contest the
admissibility of, nor contradict, this Statement of Facts in any such proceeding. The following
facts took place during the relevant time period and establish beyond a reasonable doubt the
charges set forth in the Information attached to this Agreement:

Relevant Entities

1. Alcon, Inc. was a multinational eye care company with headquarters in Fort Worth,
Texas, and incorporated in Hiinenberg, Switzerland. In or about April 2011, Alcon, Inc. merged
with Novartis AG, a global pharmaceutical company based in Basel, Switzerland, after which
Alcon, Inc. (hereinafter, the âAlcon Divisionâ) became a wholly owned subsidiary of Novartis
AG. Novartis AGâs American Depository Shares were listed and traded on the New York Stock
Exchange under the symbol âNVS.â Novartis AG was an issuer of publicly traded securities
registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and was required to file

periodic reports with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the âSECâ) under

A-1
Case 2:20-cr-00539-SDW Document 2 Filed 06/25/20 Page 29 of 70 PagelD: 47

Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act. Thus, Novartis AG was an âissuerâ within the meaning
of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (âFCPAâ), 15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78dd-1(a) and 78m(b). The Alcon
Divisionâs books, records, and accounts were included in the consolidated financial statements of
Novartis AG filed with the SEC.

2. In or about April 2019, Novartis AG spun off the Alcon Division, including Alcon
Pte Ltd, and the newly established independent parent company was named Alcon Inc. Alcon Inc.
is the lawful successor-in-interest to Alcon, Inc. (1.e., the Alcon Division).

3. In or about and between 2011 and 2014 (the ârelevant time periodâ), Alcon Pte Ltd
was an affiliate of the Alcon Division with headquarters in Singapore. Among other functions,
Alcon Pte Ltd provided financial services and managerial oversight for the Alcon Divisionâs
operations in Asia, including for two representative offices in Vietnam. Alcon Pte Ltdâs books,
records, and accounts were included in the consolidated financial statements that Novartis AG
filed with the SEC.

4. âDistributor Company,â an entity whose identity is known to the Fraud Section, the
Office, and the Company, was a limited liability company incorporated in Vietnam. Among other
business, Distributor Company marketed and sold Alcon Division products to health care providers
(âHCPsâ) and hospitals in Vietnam.

Relevant Individuals

5. âAlcon Pte Ltd Executive 1,â an individual whose identity is known to the Fraud

Section, the Office, and the Company, was a high level executive of the Company and, at various

times, was located in the United States or Singapore. For fiscal year 2014, Alcon Pte Ltd Executive

A-2
Case 2:20-cr-00539-SDW Document 2 Filed 06/25/20 Page 30 of 70 PagelD: 48

1 signed two Sarbanes-Oxley sub-certifications that were false. These false sub-certifications were
maintained as part of Novartis AGâs books, records, and accounts.

6. âAlcon Pte Ltd Executive 2,â an individual whose identity is known to the Fraud
Section, the Office, and the Company, was an employee of the Company and, at various times,
was located in the United States or Singapore.

7. âDistributor Company Executive 1,â an individual whose identity is known to the
Fraud Section, the Office, and the Company, was a high level executive of Distributor Company
during the relevant time period.

8. âDistributor Company Executive 2,â an individual whose identity is known to the
Fraud Section, the Office, and the Company, was a high level accounting executive of Distributor
Company during the relevant time period.

Operations in Vietnam

9, Vietnam owned and operated state-owned and state-controlled hospitals and
clinics, and these hospitals and clinics performed a government function. Employees of state-
owned and state-controlled hospitals and clinics in Vietnam (âVietnam State HCPsâ) were
âforeign officialsâ within the meaning of the FCPA, 15 U.S.C. Â§ 78dd-3(f)(2)(A).

10. The Alcon Division conducted business operations in Vietnam through two
representative offices located in Hanoi, Vietnam, and Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam (âAlcon
Vietnam Representative Officesâ). The Company provided management and financial reporting
oversight for the Alcon Vietnam Representative Offices.

11. The Alcon Vietnam Representative Offices did not directly conduct sales to end-

customers in Vietnam, including to state-owned and state-controlled hospitals and clinics in

A-3
Case 2:20-cr-00539-SDW Document 2 Filed 06/25/20 Page 31 of 70 PagelD: 49

Vietnam. Rather, sales to end-customers in Vietnam were conducted through Distributor
Company.

12. Among other lines of the Alcon Divisionâs eye care business, the Alcon Vietnam
Representative Offices, through Distributor Company, sold surgical equipment and devices such
as lasers and intraocular lenses (âIOLsâ) to end-customers in Vietnam, including to state-owned
and state-controlled hospitals and clinics in Vietnam. [OLs are artificial replacement lenses that
are implanted in the eye as part of a treatment for a variety of ailments such as cataracts.

Overview of the Conspiracy

13. Beginning in or about 2007, the Alcon Vietnam Representative Offices and
Distributor Company engaged in a scheme to bribe Vietnam State HCPs in order to increase sales
of IOLs. Participants in the scheme referred to it as the âconsultancy program.â

14. Under the guise of the consultancy program, Distributor Company made corrupt
payments to HCPs, including Vietnam State HCPs, in connection with sales of Alcon Division
IOLs by Distributor Company. Distributor Company made the payments directly to HCPs,
including to Vietnam State HCPs, and the Alcon Vietnam Representative Offices, with the
approval of employees of the Company, reimbursed Distributor Company for up to 50 percent of
the costs associated with the improper payments to HCPs.

15. The scheme continued after the Alcon Division merged with Novartis AG in April
2011. Thereafter, between in or about April 2011 and June 2014, the Company, through its
executives, employees, and agents, knowingly and willfully conspired and agreed with others to
cause Novartis AG to maintain false accounting records, by, among other things, falsely recording

partial reimbursements to Distributor Company for improper payments made to Vietnam State

A-4
Case 2:20-cr-00539-SDW Document 2 Filed 06/25/20 Page 32 of 70 PagelD: 50

HCPs in the Companyâs internal financial records, which were consolidated into Novartis AGâs
financial records, and by transmitting false Sarbanes-Oxley sub-certification letters to Novartis
AG. These false sub-certification letters were subsequently maintained in the books, records, and
accounts of Novartis AG.

16. In total, from 2011 through 2014, as a result of the improper payments to Vietnam
State HCPs, the Company realized approximately $8,500,000 in profits.

Details of the Scheme

17. In or around April 2007, prior to Novartis AGâs merger with the Alcon Division,
the Alcon Vietnam Representative Offices, with the knowledge and involvement of Alcon Pte Ltd
Executive 1, an Alcon Vietnam Representative Offices executive, and others, began providing
money to Distributor Company, disguised as consultancy payments and in the form of credit notes,
that Distributor Company used to make corrupt payments to HCPs, including Vietnam State HCPs.

18. In furtherance of the scheme, on or about April 3, 2007, Distributor Company
Executive 2 sent an email to Alcon Pte Ltd Executive 1, an Alcon Vietnam Representative Offices
executive, and others. In the email, Distributor Company Executive 2 referenced a meeting from
March 2007 in which details of the corrupt consultancy program were discussed. The email
attached a list of approximately 35 HCPs, including Vietnam State HCPs, who were designated to
receive payments in exchange for purchasing Alcon Division IOLs. The emailâand other
contemporaneous communicationsâalso outlined a proposal for the consultancy program as
follows:

a. The consultancy program would cover two types of Alcon Division IOLs:

IQ and Restore;

Maea 2 Ofer AOSeGlamMyar Pynacrpmant 2 Ederi AAs/OSieg
Ne TAO TA TA ed oe EAA PER Gn a Pou Aa ASA Pa

oe,

Neg

b. HCPs would be paid 200,000 VND (equivalent to then approximately
$12.50 USD) per IQ IOL purchased and 400,000 VND (equivalent to then approximately $25.00
USD) per Restore IOL purchased;

c. Distributor Company would make the payments to HCPs through bank

transfers; and

d. Alcon Vietnam Representative Offices would reimburse Distributor

Company for up to 50 percent of the costs associated with the consultancy program.

19. The consultancy program targeted doctors and nurses, many of whom were
Vietnam State HCPs. As explained in an attachment to an email from an Alcon Vietnam
Representative Offices executive dated July 21, 2008, the â[t]arget customer[s]â for the scheme

99 66

consisted of the following: â[d]Joctor[s] in the consulta[tion] room,â â[d]octor[s] in the exam

room,â â[n]Jurse[s] in the consulta[tion] room,â and the â[c]hief]s] of [Operating Rooms] inâ two
specific eye hospitals in Vietnam.

20. Furthermore, the purpose of the consultancy program, as explained in an email
dated July 26, 2008 from a Distributor Company employee to an Alcon Vietnam Representative
Offices executive, among others, was to âencourage[] doctors to introduce and use Alconâs IOLs
and... speed up IOLs sales.â

21. Atthe consultancy programâs peak, in or around 2011, Distributor Company made
corrupt payments to approximately 200 HCPs, a number of whom were Vietnam State HCPs, and
the Alcon Vietnam Representative Offices disguised reimbursement for those payments as

legitimate payments made pursuant to the consultancy program. These payments aggregated over

time. For example, during 2010, a proposed payment schedule showed one Vietnam State HCP

A-6
Case 2:20-cr-00539-SDW Document 2 Filed 06/25/20 Page 34 of 70 PagelD: 52

was scheduled to receive more than 360,000,000 VND (equivalent to then approximately $18,450
USD) pursuant to the consultancy program, while another Vietnam State HCP was scheduled to
receive more than 450,000,000 VND (equivalent to then approximately $23,352 USD).

22. Between in or about 2007 and June 2014, the Alcon Vietnam Representative
Offices, with the approval of employees of the Company and others, partially reimbursed
Distributor Company periodically for improper payments that Distributor Company made to
HCPs, including to Vietnam State HCPs (for instance, reimbursing approximately $180,000 USD
in 2010 and up to approximately $100,000 USD in 2013 and 2014).

The False Records

23. Prior to 2012, the Alcon Vietnam Representative Offices partially reimbursed
Distributor Company for improper payments made through the consultancy program by causing
another Alcon entity to issue credits to Distributor Company that offset its outstanding debt
balances. These credits were referred to as âcredit notes.â

24. The typical system for issuing the credit notes included the following steps: (a)
Distributor Company employees would regularly send emails to an Alcon Vietnam Representative
Offices employee requesting a credit note for a certain amount related to the consultancy program;
(b) the Alcon Vietnam Representative Offices employee reviewed and forwarded the requests to
regional management, including Alcon Pte Ltd Executive 2; and (c) once approved by regional
management, credit notes were issued to Distributor Company with the stated reason for the credit
note as âconsultancy fees.â

25. After 2011, Distributor Company, with the knowledge of certain employees of the

Company, continued to make improper payments to HCPs, including to Vietnam State HCPs, in

A-7
o~ aA As oP me OPN PL? ~ ae pty CoN Eee PN
Maea 2 Ofer AOSeGlamMyar Pynacrpmant 2 Ederi AAs/OSieg
Ne TAO TA TA ed oe EAA PER Gn a Pou Aa ASA Pa

oe,
4
Neg

order to increase sales of Alcon Division IOLs, and the Company continued to reimburse
Distributor Company indirectly for a portion of those payments.

26. Between in or around August 2011 and 2012, the Alcon Vietnam Representative
Offices, with the approval of employees of the Company and others, changed the methodology for
reimbursing Distributor Company for a portion of the improper payments made through the
consultancy program. Specifically, rather than rermburse Distributor Company by issuing credit
notes for âconsultancy fees,â the Alcon Vietnam Representative Offices partially reimbursed
Distributor Company for the payments through other, inflated reimbursable costs, such as
marketing, human resources, or margin reconciliation costs.

27. In furtherance of the scheme, in an email dated August 15, 2011, an Alcon Vietnam
Representative Offices executive wrote to Alcon Pte Ltd Executive 2 and others about continued
financial support for the consultancy program and suggested using Distributor Companyâs margin
in order to cover the consultancy program costs. The email noted that â[Distributor Company
Executive 1] agreed to remain their activities to secure business as much as possible but
[Distributor Company Executive 1] need[s] our support more in term[s] of finance.â In the email,
an Alcon Vietnam Representative Offices executive noted further, âI also discuss[ed] with
[Distributor Company Executive 1] our scenario of increasing the margin to cover USD 120K ..
.With this support, [Distributor Company] will propose the marketing plan for next year for
Alcon|âs] review and agree[ment] before implementation.â

28. Employees of the Company and the Alcon Vietnam Representative Offices also
discussed using a marketing budget to cover the costs of reimbursing Distributor Company in

connection with the improper payments made under the consultancy program. For example, on

November 23, 2011, a Distributor Company employee sent an email to two Alcon Vietnam
Representative Offices executives, among others, summarizing a November 9, 2011 meeting,
during which personnel from Distributor Company and from the Alcon Vietnam Representative
Offices discussed various ways that the consultancy program would operate in 2012. Specifically,
the Distributor Company employee wrote: âConsultant Program in 2012: Alcon will consider and
share the finance difficulties of [Distributor Company] by:

e Increasing the ratio[] share of Loss of exchange rate...

e [Playing sample for [Distributor Company |

e [Using some money from marketing budget to support [Distributor

Company].â

29. Furthermore, during a phone call in or around late summer 2014, Distributor
Company Executive | told an Alcon Pte Ltd employee that Distributor Company had used up all
of its funds to pay for Alcon Divisionâs surgical equipment and could no longer pay the âusual
considerationsâ to Vietnamese HCPs to ensure they purchased Alcon Division products.

30. âIn or around May or June 2014, Alcon Pte Ltd Executive 1 told an Alcon Pte Ltd
employee, who was responsible for reviewing the financials for the Alcon Divisionâs business in
Vietnam, that no one needed to know about Distributor Companyâs 2014 profit and loss analysis
(âDistributor Companyâs P&L Analysisâ).

31. Shortly thereafter, on or about June 11, 2014, an Alcon Vietnam Representative
Offices executive sent an Alcon Pte Ltd employee a copy of Distributor Companyâs P&L Analysis,
which included a number of line 1tems that concealed improper payments to HCPs, including to

Vietnam State HCPs, in FY 2013 and FY 2014, including: purported â[clonsultant costâ of

approximately $111,157 USD for FY 2013, purported â[c]Jonsultant costâ of approximately

A-9

Mace 2 ole ASSO 5 PRAl Pacument 2 Fuller! OBfeSs/ek

$97,000 USD for FY 2014, purported âHRâ cost of approximately $800,000 USD for FY 2013,
purported âHRâ cost of approximately $740,000 USD for FY 2014, purported â[a]dministration
costâ of approximately $514,000 USD for FY 2013, and purported â[a]dministration costâ of
approximately $572,000 USD for FY 2014.

32. Together, these entries in Distributor Companyâs P&L Analysis correlated to
ongoing efforts by the Company to conceal the reimbursement of Distributor Company for
improper payments made to Vietnam State HCPs and others.

33. The Company, through its executives, employees, and agents, knowingly and
willfully conspired and agreed with others to falsely record in the Companyâs internal financial
records partial rermbursement of the improper payments that Distributor Company made to HCPs,
including to Vietnam State HCPs, pursuant to the consultancy program. By recording
reimbursements for these payments as legitimate expenses, such as consulting expenses, marketing
expenses, human resource expenses, administration costs, and/or margin reconciliation costs, the
Company, through its executives, employees, and agents, concealed the true nature of these
payments and caused Novartis AG to maintain false financial records.

34. Furthermore, as part of the conspiracy, Alcon Pte Ltd Executive 1, who participated
in the scheme and knew of the corrupt payments to Vietnam State HCPs, signed and transmitted
two false Sarbanes-Oxley sub-certification letters dated July 4, 2014, and October 7, 2014, to the
Alcon Divisionâs Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. These false sub-
certification letters were subsequently maintained in the books, records, and accounts of Novartis

AG.

ATTACHMENT D

REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
Alcon Inc. agrees that it will report to the Fraud Section and the Office periodically, at no

less than twelve-month intervals during a three-year term, regarding remediation and
implementation of the compliance program and internal controls, policies, and procedures
described in Attachment C. During this three-year period, Alcon Inc. shall: (1) conduct an initial
review and submit an initial report, and (2) conduct and prepare at least two follow-up reviews
and reports, as described below:

a. By no later than one year from the date this Agreement is executed, Alcon
Inc. shall submit to the Fraud Section and the Office a written report setting forth a complete
description of its remediation efforts to date, its proposals reasonably designed to improve Alcon
Inc.âs internal controls, policies, and procedures for ensuring compliance with the FCPA and
other applicable anti-corruption laws, and the proposed scope of the subsequent reviews. The
report shall be transmitted to Chief, FCPA Unit, Fraud Section, Criminal Division, U.S.
Department of Justice, 1400 New York Avenue, NW, Bond Building, 11th Floor, Washington,
D.C. 20530 and Chief, Health Care Fraud Unit, United States Attorneyâs Office for the District
of New Jersey, 970 Broad Street, 7th Floor, Newark, New Jersey 07102. Alcon Inc. may extend
the time period for issuance of the report with prior written approval of the Fraud Section.

b. Alcon Inc. shall undertake at least two follow-up reviews and reports,

reasonably designed to detect and prevent violations of the FCPA and other applicable anti-
corruption laws.

C. The first follow-up review and report shall be completed by no later than
one year after the initial report is submitted to the Fraud Section and the Office. The second
follow-up review and report shall be completed and delivered to the Fraud Section and the Office
no later than thirty days before the end of the Term.

d. The reports will likely include proprietary, financial, confidential, and
competitive business information. Moreover, public disclosure of the reports could discourage
cooperation, impede pending or potential government investigations and thus undermine the
objectives of the reporting requirement. For these reasons, among others, the reports and the
contents thereof are intended to remain and shall remain non-public, except as otherwise agreed
to by the parties in writing, or except to the extent that the Fraud Section and the Office
determine in their sole discretion that disclosure would be in furtherance of the Fraud Sectionâs
and the Officeâs discharge of their duties and responsibilities or is otherwise required by law.

e. Alcon Inc. may extend the time period for submission of any of the

follow-up reports with prior written approval of the Fraud Section and the Office.

INFORMATION

 

The United States charges that, at all times relevant to this Information,

unless otherwise specified:

GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

 

Relevant Statutory Background

1. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, 15 U.S.C.
Â§Â§ 78dd-1, et seq. (the âFCPAâ), was enacted by Congress for the purpose of, among
other things, making it unlawful to act corruptly in furtherance of an offer, promise,
authorization, or payment of money or anything of value, directly or indirectly, to a
foreign official for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business for, or directing
business to, any person. Pertinent to this charge, the FCPAâs accounting provisions,
among other things, require every issuer of publicly traded securities registered
pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. Â§ 781, or
required to file periodic reports with the United States Securities and Exchange

Commission (âSECâ) under Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C Â§
Case 2:20-cr-00539-SDW Document 2 Filed 06/25/20 Page 54 of 70 PagelD: 72

780(d), to make and keep books, records, and accounts that accurately and fairly
reflect transactions and the distribution of the companyâs assets, and prohibit the
knowing and willful falsification of an issuerâs books, records, or accounts. 15 U.S.C.
Â§Â§ 78m(b)(2)(A), 78m(b)(5), and 78ff(a).

ALCON PTE LTD and Other Relevant Entities

 

2. Alcon, Inc. was a multinational eye care company with
headquarters in Fort Worth, Texas, and incorporated in Hinenberg, Switzerland. In
or about April 2011, Alcon, Inc. merged with Novartis AG, a global pharmaceutical
company based in Basel, Switzerland, after which Alcon, Inc. (the âAlcon Divisionâ)
became a wholly owned subsidiary of Novartis AG. Novartis AGâs American
Depository Shares were listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange under
the symbol âNVS.â Novartis AG was an issuer of publicly traded securities registered
pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and was required to file
periodic reports with the SEC under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act. Thus,
Novartis AG was an âissuerâ within the meaning of the FCPA, 15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78dd-1(a)
and 78m(b). The Alcon Divisionâs books, records, and accounts were included in the
consolidated financial statements of Novartis AG filed with the SEC.

3. In or about April 2019, Novartis AG spun off the Alcon Division,
including defendant ALCON PTE LTD, and the newly established independent
parent company was named âAlcon Inc.â Alcon Inc. is the lawful successor-in-interest

to Alcon, Inc. (i.e., the Alcon Division).
Case 2:20-cr-00539-SDW Document 2 Filed 06/25/20 Page 55 of 70 PagelD: 73

4. From in or about 2011 to in or about 2014 (the ârelevant time
periodâ), ALCON PTE LTD was an affiliate of the Alcon Division with headquarters
in Singapore. Among other functions, ALCON PTE LTD provided financial services
and managerial oversight for the Alcon Divisionâs operations in Asia, including for
two representative offices in Vietnam. ALCON PTE LTDâs books, records, and
accounts were included in the consolidated financial statements that Novartis AG
filed with the SEC.

5. The âDistributor Company,â an entity whose identity is known to
the United States and ALCON PTE LTD, was a limited lability company
incorporated in Vietnam. Among other business, Distributor Company marketed and
sold Alcon Division products to health care providers (âHCPsâ) and hospitals in
Vietnam.

Relevant Individuals

 

6. âAlcon Pte Ltd Executive 1,â an individual whose identity is
known to the United States, was a high level executive of ALCON PTE LTD and, at
various times, was located in the United States or Singapore. For fiscal year 2014,
Alcon Pte Ltd Executive 1 signed two Sarbanes-Oxley sub-certifications that were
false. These false sub-certifications were maintained as part of Novartis AGâs books,

records, and accounts.
Case 2:20-cr-00539-SDW Document 2 Filed 06/25/20 Page 56 of 70 PagelD: 74

7. âAlcon Pte Ltd Executive 2,â an individual whose identity is
known to the United States, was an employee of ALCON PTE LTD and, at various
times, was located in the United States or Singapore.

8. âDistributor Company Executive 1,â an individual whose identity
is known to the United States, was a high level executive of Distributor Company
during the relevant time period.

9. âDistributor Company Executive 2,â an individual whose identity
is known to the United States, was a high level accounting executive of Distributor
Company during the relevant time period.

Operations in Vietnam

 

10. Vietnam owned and operated state-owned and state-controlled
hospitals and clinics, and these hospitals and clinics performed a government
function. Employees of state-owned and state-controlled hospitals and clinics in
Vietnam (âVietnam State HCPsâ) were âforeign officialsâ within the meaning of the
FCPA, 15 U.S.C. Â§ 78dd-3(f)(2)(A).

11. The Alcon Division conducted business operations in Vietnam
through two representative offices located in Hanoi, Vietnam, and Ho Chi Minh City,
Vietnam (âAlcon Vietnam Representative Officesâ). ALCON PTE LTD provided
management and financial reporting oversight for the Alcon Vietnam Representative

Offices.
Case 2:20-cr-00539-SDW Document 2 Filed 06/25/20 Page 57 of 70 PagelD: 75

12. The Alcon Vietnam Representative Offices did not directly
conduct sales to end-customers in Vietnam, including to state-owned and state-
controlled hospitals and clinics in Vietnam. Rather, sales to end-customers in
Vietnam were conducted through the Distributor Company.

13. Among other lines of the Alcon Divisionâs eye care business, the
Alcon Vietnam Representative Offices, through the Distributor Company, sold
surgical equipment and devices such as lasers and intraocular lenses (âIOLsâ) to end-
customers in Vietnam, including to state-owned and state-controlled hospitals and
clinics in Vietnam. IOLs are artificial replacement lenses that are implanted in the
eye as part of a treatment for a variety of ailments, such as cataracts.

Overview of the Conspiracy

 

14. Beginning in or about 2007, the Alcon Vietnam Representative
Offices and the Distributor Company engaged in a scheme to bribe Vietnam State
HCPs in order to increase sales of LOLs. Participants in the scheme referred to it as
the âconsultancy program.â

15. Under the guise of the consultancy program, the Distributor
Company made corrupt payments to HCPs, including Vietnam State HCPs, in
connection with sales of Alcon Division IOLs by the Distributor Company. The
Distributor Company made the payments directly to HCPs, including to Vietnam

State HCPs. The Alcon Vietnam Representative Offices, with the approval of
Case 2:20-cr-00539-SDW Document 2 Filed 06/25/20 Page 58 of 70 PagelD: 76

employees of ALCON PTE LTD, reimbursed the Distributor Company for up to 50
percent of the costs associated with the improper payments to HCPs.

16. The scheme continued after the Alcon Division merged with
Novartis AG in or about April 2011. Thereafter, between in or about April 2011 and
in or about June 2014, ALCON PTE LTD, through its executives, employees, and
agents, knowingly and willfully conspired and agreed with others to cause Novartis
AG to maintain false accounting records, by, among other things, falsely recording
partial reimbursements to the Distributor Company for improper payments made to
Vietnam State HCPs in ALCON PTE LTDâs internal financial records, which were
consolidated into Novartis AGâs financial records, and by transmitting false
Sarbanes-Oxley sub-certification letters to Novartis AG. These false sub-certification
letters were subsequently maintained in the books, records, and accounts of Novartis
AG.

17. In total, from in or about 2011 through in or about 2014, as a
result of the improper payments to Vietnam State HCPs, ALCON PTE LTD realized
approximately $8,500,000 in profits.

Details of the Scheme

 

18. In or about April 2007, prior to Novartis AGâs merger with the
Alcon Division, the Alcon Vietnam Representative Offices, with the knowledge and
involvement of Alcon Pte Ltd Executive 1, an Alcon Vietnam Representative Offices
executive, and others, began providing money to the Distributor Company, disguised

as consultancy payments and in the form of credit notes, that the Distributor
Company used to make corrupt payments to HCPs, including Vietnam State HCPs.

19. In furtherance of the scheme, on or about April 3, 2007,
Distributor Company Executive 2 sent an email to Alcon Pte Ltd Executive 1, an
Alcon Vietnam Representative Offices executive, and others. In the email, Distributor
Company Executive 2 referenced a meeting from March 2007 in which details of the
corrupt consultancy program were discussed. The email attached a list of
approximately 35 HCPs, including Vietnam State HCPs, who were designated to
receive payments in exchange for purchasing Alcon Division I[OLs. The emailâand
other contemporaneous communicationsâalso outlined a proposal for the
consultancy program as follows:

a. The consultancy program would cover two types of Alcon
Division [OLs: IQ and Restore;

b. HCPs would be paid 200,000 VND (then equivalent to
approximately $12.50) per IQ IOL purchased and 400,000 VND (then equivalent to
approximately $25.00) per Restore IOL purchased;

C. The Distributor Company would make the payments to
HCPs through bank transfers; and

d. Alcon Vietnam Representative Offices would reimburse
Distributor Company for up to 50 percent of the costs associated with the consultancy

program.

20. The consultancy program targeted doctors and nurses, many of
whom were Vietnam State HCPs. As explained in an attachment to an email from an
Alcon Vietnam Representative Offices executive dated July 21, 2008, the â[t]arget

9?

customer|s]â for the scheme consisted of the following: â[dJoctor[s] in the
consulta[tion] room,â â[d]octor[s] in the exam room,â â[n]urse[s] in the consulta|[tion]
room,â and the â[c]hief[s] of [Operating Rooms] inâ two specific eye hospitals in
Vietnam.

21. Furthermore, the purpose of the consultancy program, as
explained in an email dated July 26, 2008, from a Distributor Company employee to
an Alcon Vietnam Representative Offices executive, among others, was to
âencourage|] doctors to introduce and use Alconâs IOLs and. . . speed up IOLs sales.â

22. At the consultancy programâs peak, in or about 2011, the
Distributor Company made corrupt payments to approximately 200 HCPs, a number
of whom were Vietnam State HCPs, and the Alcon Vietnam Representative Offices
disguised reimbursement for those payments as legitimate payments made pursuant
to the consultancy program. These payments aggregated over time. For example,
during 2010, a proposed payment schedule showed one Vietnam State HCP was
scheduled to receive more than 360,000,000 VND (then equivalent to approximately
$18,450) pursuant to the consultancy program, while another Vietnam State HCP

was scheduled to receive more than 450,000,000 VND (then equivalent to

approximately $23,352).

23. Between in or about 2007 and in or about June 2014, the Alcon
Vietnam Representative Offices, with the approval of employees of ALCON PTE LTD
and others, partially reimbursed the Distributor Company periodically for improper
payments that the Distributor Company made to HCPs, including to Vietnam State
HCPs (for instance, reimbursing approximately $180,000 in or about 2010 and up to
approximately $100,000 in or about 2013 and 2014).

The False Records

 

24. Prior to in or about 2012, the Alcon Vietnam Representative
Offices partially reimbursed the Distributor Company for improper payments made
through the consultancy program by causing another Alcon entity to issue credits to
the Distributor Company that offset its outstanding debt balances. These credits were
referred to as âcredit notes.â

25. The typical system for issuing the credit notes included the
following steps: (a) Distributor Company employees would regularly send emails to
an Alcon Vietnam Representative Offices employee requesting a credit note for a
certain amount related to the consultancy program; (b) the Alcon Vietnam
Representative Offices employee reviewed and forwarded the requests to regional
management, including Alcon Pte Ltd Executive 2; and (c) once approved by regional
management, credit notes were issued to the Distributor Company with the stated

reason for the credit note as âconsultancy fees.â

26. After 2011, the Distributor Company, with the knowledge of
certain employees of ALCON PTE LTD, continued to make improper payments to
HCPs, including to Vietnam State HCPs, in order to increase sales of Alcon Division
IOLs, and ALCON PTE LTD continued to reimburse the Distributor Company
indirectly for a portion of those payments.

27. Between in or about August 2011 and in or about 2012, the Alcon
Vietnam Representative Offices, with the approval of employees of ALCON PTE LTD
and others, changed the methodology for reimbursing the Distributor Company for a
portion of the improper payments made through the consultancy program.
Specifically, rather than reimburse the Distributor Company by issuing credit notes
for âconsultancy fees,â the Alcon Vietnam Representative Offices partially
reimbursed the Distributor Company for the payments through other, inflated
reimbursable costs, such as marketing, human resources, or margin reconciliation
costs.

28. In furtherance of the scheme, in an email dated August 15, 2011,
an Alcon Vietnam Representative Offices executive wrote to Alcon Pte Ltd Executive
2 and others about continued financial support for the consultancy program and
suggested using the Distributor Companyâs margin in order to cover the consultancy
program costs. The email noted that â[Distributor Company Executive 1] agreed to
remain their activities to secure business as much as possible but [Distributor
Company Executive 1] need[s] our support more in term|s] of finance.â In the email,

an Alcon Vietnam Representative Offices executive noted further, âI also discuss[ed]
with [Distributor Company Executive 1] our scenario of increasing the margin to
cover USD 120K ... With this support, [the Distributor Company] will propose the
marketing plan for next year for Alcon|âs] review and agree[ment] before
implementation.â

29. Employees of ALCON PTE LTD and the Alcon Vietnam
Representative Offices also discussed using a marketing budget to cover the costs of
reimbursing Distributor Company in connection with the improper payments made
under the consultancy program. For example, on or about November 23, 2011, a
Distributor Company employee sent an email to two Alcon Vietnam Representative
Offices executives, among others, summarizing a November 9, 2011 meeting, during
which personnel from the Distributor Company and from the Alcon Vietnam
Representative Offices discussed various ways that the consultancy program would
operate in 2012. Specifically, the Distributor Company employee wrote: âConsultant
Program in 2012: Alcon will consider and share the finance difficulties of [Distributor
Company] by:

e Increasing the ratio[| share of Loss of exchange rate...

e [Playing sample for [Distributor Company]

e [U]sing some money from marketing budget to support
[Distributor Company].â

30. Furthermore, during a phone call in or about late summer 2014,

Distributor Company Executive 1 told an Alcon Pte Ltd employee that the Distributor

a

Company had used up all of its funds to pay for Alcon Divisionâs surgical equipment
and could no longer pay the âusual considerationsâ to Vietnamese HCPs to ensure
they purchased Alcon Division products.

31.  Inor about May or June 2014, Alcon Pte Ltd Executive 1 told an
Alcon Pte Ltd employee, who was responsible for reviewing the financials for the
Alcon Divisionâs business in Vietnam, that no one needed to know about the
Distributor Companyâs 2014 profit and loss analysis (âDistributor Companyâs P&L
Analysisâ).

32. Shortly thereafter, on or about June 11, 2014, an Alcon Vietnam
Representative Offices executive sent an Alcon Pte Ltd employee a copy of the
Distributor Companyâs P&L Analysis, which included a number of line items that
concealed improper payments to HCPs, including to Vietnam State HCPs, in fiscal
year (âFYâ) 2013 and FY 2014, including: purported â[c]onsultant costâ of
approximately $111,157 for FY 2013, purported â[c]onsultant costâ of approximately
$97,000 for FY 2014, purported âHRâ cost of approximately $800,000 for FY 2013,
purported âHRâ cost of approximately $740,000 for FY 2014, purported
âlajdministration costâ of approximately $514,000 for FY 2013, and purported
âla]dministration costâ of approximately $572,000 for FY 2014.

33. Together, these entries in the Distributor Companys P&L

Analysis correlated to ongoing efforts by ALCON PTE LTD to conceal the

reimbursement of the Distributor Company for improper payments made to Vietnam
State HCPs and others.

34. ALCON PTE LTD, through its executives, employees, and agents,
knowingly and willfully conspired and agreed with others to falsely record in ALCON
PTE LTDâs internal financial records partial reimbursement of the improper
payments that the Distributor Company made to HCPs, including to Vietnam State
HCPs, pursuant to the consultancy program. By recording reimbursements for these
payments as legitimate expenses, such as consulting expenses, marketing expenses,
human resource expenses, administration costs, and/or margin reconciliation costs,
ALCON PTE LTD, through its executives, employees, and agents, concealed the true
nature of these payments and caused Novartis AG to maintain false financial records.

35. Furthermore, as part of the conspiracy, Alcon Pte Ltd Executive
1, who participated in the scheme and knew of the corrupt payments to Vietnam State
HCPs, signed and transmitted two false Sarbanes-Oxley sub-certification letters
dated July 4, 2014, and October 7, 2014, to the Alcon Divisionâs Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer. These false sub-certification letters were

subsequently maintained in the books, records, and accounts of Novartis AG.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Thursday, June 25, 2020

Novartis Hellas S.A.C.I. and Alcon Pte Ltd Agree to Pay over $233 Million Combined to Resolve
Criminal FCPA Cases

Novartis AG, Novartis Hellas S.A.C.I., and Alcon Pte Ltd Agree to Pay over $345 million Combined to Resolve
FCPA Matters with the Government

Novartis Hellas S.A.C.I. (Novartis Greece), a subsidiary of Novartis AG, a Switzerland-based global pharmaceutical company, and Alcon Pte Ltd, a
former subsidiary of Novartis AG and current subsidiary of Alcon Inc., a multinational eye care company, have agreed to pay a combined total of
more than $233 million in criminal monetary penalties to resolve the departmentâs investigation into violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act (FCPA).

The resolutions arise out of a Novartis Greece scheme to bribe employees of state-owned and state-controlled hospitals and clinics in Greece
and to falsely record improper payments relating to the corrupt scheme and similar conduct, and an Alcon Pte Ltd scheme to make and falsely
record improper payments in Vietnam. Novartis AG has also agreed to pay over $112 million to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) in a related matter.

Novartis Greece entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the
District of New Jersey in connection with a criminal information filed today in the District of New Jersey charging Novartis Greece with one count
of conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA and one count of conspiracy to violate the books and records provision of the
FCPA. Pursuant to the deferred prosecution agreement, Novartis Greece has committed to pay a total criminal monetary penalty of $225
million.

Alcon Pte Ltd, a subsidiary of Novartis AG at the time of the misconduct, separately entered into a deferred prosecution agreement in
connection with a criminal information filed today in the District of New Jersey charging Alcon Pte Ltd with conspiracy to violate the books and
records provision of the FCPA. Pursuant to the deferred prosecution agreement, Alcon Pte Ltd has committed to pay a total criminal monetary
penalty of approximately $8.9 million.

âNovartis AGâs subsidiaries profited from bribes that induced medical professionals, hospitals, and clinics to prescribe Novartis-branded
pharmaceuticals and use Alcon surgical products, and they falsified their books and records to conceal those bribes,â said Assistant Attorney
General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division. âThe resolutions announced today reflect the paramount
importance of effective compliance programs and the departmentâs commitment to holding companies accountable when they fall short.â

âThe agreement weâre announcing today shows that there will be a heavy price paid by companies that violate our laws, whether at home or
overseas,â said U.S. Attorney Craig Carpenito for the District of New Jersey. âJust as importantly, it includes a framework for compliance
reforms that should ensure that these companies conduct their business legally moving forward.â

âThe FBI is committed to fighting any corrupt acts that adversely impact our economy, our citizenry, or our way of life,â said Acting Special
Agent in Charge Douglas Korneski of the FBIâs Newark Field Office. âI say this to every company doing business on the stock exchange - if you
think you can ignore the rules or make up your own, if your business model includes bribery or a quid pro quo, you can count the days until we
show up on your company's doorstep. We will protect our citizens, our economy, our way of life, and bring to justice anyone who breaks the
law.â

According to its admissions, between 2012 and 2015, Novartis Greece conspired with others to violate the FCPA by engaging in a scheme to
bribe employees of state-owned and state-controlled hospitals and clinics in Greece in order to increase the sale of Novartis-branded
pharmaceutical products. Specifically, Novartis Greece paid for employees of state-owned and state-controlled hospitals and clinics to travel to
international medical congresses, including events held in the United States, as a means to bribe these officials in exchange for increasing the
number of prescriptions they wrote for Lucentis, a prescription drug that Novartis Greece sold. In furtherance of the scheme, Novartis Greece
employees traveled to the United States, and, while located in the United States, facilitated the provision of the improper benefits to publicly-
employed Greek health care providers.

In connection with the resolution, Novartis Greece also admitted that between 2009 and 2010, Novartis Greece made improper payments to
health care providers in connection with an epidemiological study that was intended to increase sales of certain Novartis-branded prescription
drugs. The epidemiological study was used as a vehicle to make improper payments to the health care providers in order to increase sales of
certain Novartis-branded prescription drugs, and Novartis Greece employees recognized that many participating health care providers believed
that they were being paid in exchange for writing prescriptions of Novartis products and not for providing data as part of a clinical study.

In furtherance of both schemes, Novartis Greece, through its employees and agents, knowingly and willfully conspired with others to cause
Novartis AG to mischaracterize and falsely record improper payments related to the international medical congresses and the epidemiological
study in Novartis AGâs books, records, and accounts.

According to its admissions, from 2011 through 2014, Alcon Pte Ltd knowingly and willfully conspired with others to cause Novartis AG to
maintain false books, records and accounts, as a result of a scheme to bribe employees of state-owned and state-controlled hospitals and clinics
in Vietnam. Specifically, the false books and records resulted from a scheme in which Alcon employees in Vietnam made corrupt payments
through a third-party distributor to employees of state-owned and state-controlled hospitals and clinics in Vietnam in order to increase sales of
intraocular lenses. Intraocular lenses are artificial replacement lenses that are implanted in the eye as part of a treatment for a variety of
ailments such as cataracts. Alcon employees in Vietnam, reimbursed the distributor for up to 50 percent of the cost of the corrupt payments,
and these reimbursements were falsely recorded as, among other things, consulting expenses, marketing expenses, and human resource
expenses.

As part of the agreement with Novartis Greece, Novartis Greece agreed to continue to cooperate with the U.S. government in any ongoing or
future criminal investigations concerning Novartis Greece, its executives, employees, or agents. In addition, under the agreement, Novartis
Greece and its parent company, Novartis AG, agreed to enhance their compliance programs and to report to the government on the
implementation of their enhanced compliance programs.

As part of the agreement with Alcon Pte Ltd, Alcon Pte Ltd agreed to continue to cooperate with the government in any ongoing or future
criminal investigations concerning Alcon Pte Ltd, its executives, employees, or agents. In addition, under the agreement, Alcon Pte Ltd and its
parent company, Alcon Inc., agreed to enhance their compliance programs and to report to the government on the implementation of their
enhanced compliance programs.

The government reached these resolutions with Novartis Greece and Alcon Pte Ltd based on a number of factors, including the failure to timely
disclose the conduct that triggered the investigations; the nature and seriousness of the offenses, which spanned multiple years and involved
high level employees; the lack of an effective compliance and ethics program at the time of the misconduct; and credit for each companyâs
respective cooperation. The companies also engaged in remedial measures, including terminating and disciplining individuals who orchestrated
the misconduct, adopting heightened controls and anti-corruption protocols, and significantly increasing the resources devoted to compliance.

The criminal monetary penalty for Novartis Greece reflects a 25 percent reduction off a point near the midpoint of the U.S. Sentencing
Guidelines range because, although Novartis Greece fully cooperated and remediated, its parent company Novartis AG was involved in similar
conduct for which it previously reached a resolution with the SEC in March 2016.

The criminal monetary penalty for Alcon Pte Ltd reflects a 25 percent reduction off the bottom of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines fine range
because of Alcon Pte Ltdâs full cooperation with the government's investigation.

In a related matter with the SEC, Novartis AG agreed to pay the SEC disgorgement and prejudgment interest totaling approximately $112
million for the conduct in Greece and Vietnam, as well as additional conduct.

The FBI's Garrett Mountain, New Jersey Field Office is investigating the case. Trial Attorney Della Sentilles of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud
Section and Senior Trial Counsel Bernard J. Cooney and Assistant U.S. Attorney Joshua L. Haber of the U.S. Attorneyâs Office Health Care Fraud
Unit are prosecuting the case.

The department appreciates the assistance of the Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs and the significant cooperation provided by
the SEC in this case.

The Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice Departmentâs FCPA
enforcement efforts can be found at www.justice.gov/criminal-fraud/foreign-corrupt-practices-act.

ALEJANDRO ANDRADE CEDENO (hereinafter referred to as the âdefendantâ) enter into the
following agreement:

1, The defendant understands that he has the right to have the evidence and charge
against him presented to a federal grand jury for determination of whether there is probable cause
to believe he committed the offense for which he is charged. Understanding that right, and after
full and complete consultation with his counsel, the defendant agrees to waive in open court his
right to prosecution by Indictment, agrees to waive any challenges to the statute of limitations or
venue, and agrees that the Government may proceed by way of an Information filed pursuant to
Rule 7 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.

knowingly engage and attempt to engage in monetary transactions by, through, or to a financial

institution, affecting interstate and foreign commerce, in criminally derived property of a value
 

greater than $10,000, such property having been derived from a specified unlawful activity (i.e. a
violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (âFCPAâ), in violation of Title 15, United States
Code, Section 78dd-3) in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1956(h).

3. The defendant is aware that the sentence will be imposed by the Court after
considering the advisory Federal Sentencing Guidelines and Policy Statements (hereinafter
âSentencing Guidelinesâ), The defendant acknowledges and understands that the Court will
compute an advisory sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines and that the applicable guidelines

advisory Sentencing Guidelines range that it has computed, and may raise or lower that advisory
sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines. The defendant is further aware and understands that

all facts pertinent to the sentencing process, including all relevant information concerning the
offenses committed, whether charged or not as well as concerning the defendant and the
defendantâs background. Subject only to the express terms of any agreed-upon sentencing
recommendations contained in this agreement, the Government further reserves the right to make
any recommendation as to the quality and quantity of punishment.

7. The Government agrees that it will recommend at sentencing that the Court reduce
by two levels the Sentencing Guidelines level applicable to the defendantâs offense, pursuant to
Section 3E1.1(a) of the Sentencing Guidelines, based upon the defendantâs recognition and
affirmative and timely acceptance of personal responsibility. If, at the time of sentencing the
defendantâs offense level is determined to be 16 or greater, the Government will file a motion
requesting an additional one level decrease pursuant to Section 3E1.1(b) of the Sentencing
Guidelines, stating that the defendant has assisted authorities in the investigation or prosecution of
the defendantâs own misconduct by timely notifying authorities of the defendantâs intention to

3
 

enter a plea of guilty, thereby permitting the Government to avoid preparing for trial and permitting
the Government and the Court to allocate their resources efficiently. The Government, however,
will not be required to make this motion and this recommendation if the,defendant: (a) fails or
refuses to make a full, accurate and complete disclosure to the probation office of the
circumstances surrounding the relevant offense conduct; (b) is found to have misrepresented facts
to the Government prior to entering into this plea agreement; or (c) commits any misconduct after
entering into this plea agreement, including, but not limited to, committing a state or federal

offense, violating any term of release, or making false statements or misrepresentations to any
governmental entity or official.

8. The defendant agrees that he shall cooperate fully with the Government by: (a)
providing truthful and complete information and testimony, and producing documents, records and
other evidence, when called upon by the Government, whether in interviews, before a grand jury,
or at any trial or other Court proceeding; (b) appearing at such grand jury proceedings, hearings,
trials, and other judicial proceedings, and at meetings, as may be required by the Government; and
(c) if requested by the Government, working in an undercover role under the supervision of, and
in compliance with, law enforcement officers and agents. In addition, the defendant agrees that -
he will not protect any person or entity through false information or omission, that he will not
falsely implicate any person or entity, and that he that he will not commit any further crimes.

9. The Government reserves the right to evaluate the nature and extent of the
defendantâs cooperation and to make that cooperation, or lack thereof, known to the Court at the
time of sentencing. Ifin the sole and unreviewable judgment of the Government, the defendantâs
cooperation is of such quality and significance to the investigation or prosecution of other criminal
matters as to warrant the Courtâs downward departure from the advisory sentencing range

A
calculated under the Sentencing Guidelines and/or any applicable minimum mandatory sentence,
the Government may make a motion prior to sentencing pursuant to Section 5K1.1 of the
Sentencing Guidelines and/or Title 18, United States Code, Section 3553(e), or subsequent to
sentencing pursuant to Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, informing the Court
that the defendant has provided substantial assistance and recommending that the defendant's
sentence be reduced. The defendant understands and agrees, however, that nothing in this
agreement requires the Government to file any such motions, and that the Governmentâs
assessment of the quality and significance of the defendantâs cooperation shall be binding as it
relates to the appropriateness of the Governmentâs filing or non-filing of a motion to reduce
sentence.

10. The defendant understands and acknowledges that the Court is under no obligation
to grant a motion for reduction of sentence filed by the Government. In addition, the defendant
further understands and acknowledges that the Court is under no obligation of any type to reduce
the defendantâs sentence because of the defendantâs cooperation.

11. The defendant agrees to forfeit to the United States voluntarily and immediately all
property, real or personal, involved in the violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section
1956(h) charged in the Information, property traceable to such property, and/or property that
constitute substitute assets, pursuant to Title | 8, United States Code, Section 982(a)(1) and Title
21, United States Code, Section 853(p). The defendant agrees that such property includes, but is
not limited to, a sum equal in value to the total amount laundered to, by, and/or for the benefit of
the defendant as part of the charged conspiracy, which the United States may seek as a forfeiture
money judgment. The defendant agrees to consent to the entry of orders of forfeiture for such
property. The defendant admits and agrees that the conduct described in the Information and

5
 

Factual Proffer provides a sufficient factual and statutory basis for the forfeiture sought by the
Government. .

12. The defendant agrees to waive any appeal of the forfeiture. The defendant waives
the requirements of Rules 32.2 and 43(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure regarding
notice of the forfeiture in the Information, announcement of the forfeiture at sentencing, and
incorporation of the forfeiture in the judgment. The defendant also waives any failure by the Â©
Court to advise the defendant of any applicable forfeiture at the time the guilty plea is accepted as
required by Rule 11(b)(1)(J) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The defendant further
agrees to waive any applicable time limits for the initiation of administrative or judicial forfeiture
proceedings and/or further notification of any such forfeiture brought against the property sought

for forfeiture.

13. The defendant also agrees to assist the Government in all proceedings,
administrative or judicial, involving forfeiture to the United States of any property, including
substitute property, regardless of its nature or form, real or personal, which the defendant or others
known to the defendant, have accumulated as a result of illegal activities. The defendant agrees

â that the United States shall, at its option, be entitled to forfeiture of any property (substitute assets)
of the defendant to satisfy the forfeiture money judgment. The defendant agrees that all elements
of Title 21, United States Code, Section 853(p) have been satisfied. The defendant further agrees
to take all steps necessary to locate property that could be used to satisfy the forfeiture money
judgment and to pass title to the United States before the defendantâs sentencing. To that end, the
defendant agrees to fully assist the Government in the recovery and return to the United States of
any assets, or portions thereof, wherever located. The assistance shall include: identification of
any property subject to forfeiture, agreement to the entry of an order enjoining the transfer or

6
 

encumbrance of such property, and the transfer or repatriation of such property to the United States
by delivery to the Government, upon the Governmentâs request, any necessary and appropriate
documentation, including consents to forfeiture and quit claim deeds, to deliver good and
marketable title to such property. The defendant understands that failure to transfer or repatriate
property subject to forfeiture may result in an obstruction of justice enhancement at sentencing.

14. The defendant further understands that forfeiture is independent of any
assessments, fines, costs, restitution, or any other penalty that may be imposed by the Court. The
defendant knowingly and voluntarily waives any claim or defense he may have under the Eighth
Amendment to the United States Constitution, including any claim of excessive fine or penalty
with respect to the forfeited property.

15. The defendant agrees to make full and accurate disclosure of his financial affairs to
the Government, and expressly authorizes the Government to obtain a credit report. The
defendant agrees that within 45 calendar days of his change of plea and upon request of the
Government, the defendant shall submit a completed Financial Disclosure Statement (form
provided by the United States), and shall fully disclose and identify all assets in which he has any
interest and/ot over which the defendant exercises control, directly or indirectly, including those
held by a spouse, nominee, or other third party.

16. The defendant is aware that Title 18, United States Code, Section 3742 and Title
28, United States Code, Section 1291 afford the defendant the right to appeal the sentence imposed
in this case. Acknowledging this, in exchange for the undertakings made by the Government in
this plea agreement, the defendant hereby waives all rights conferred by Sections 3742 and 1291
to appeal any sentence imposed, including any restitution order, or to appeal the manner in which
the sentence was imposed, unless the sentence exceeds the maximum permitted by statute or is the

7
 

result of an upward departure and/or an upward variance from the advisory guideline range that
the Court establishes at sentencing. The defendant further understands that nothing in this
agreement shall affect the Governmentâs right and/or duty to appeal as set forth in Title 18, United
States Code, Section 3742(b) and Title 28, United States Code, Section 1291. However, if the
Government appeals the defendantâs sentence pursuant to Sections 3742(b) and 1291, the
defendant shall be released from the above waiver of appellate rights. By signing this agreement,
the defendant acknowledges that the defendant has discussed the appeal waiver set forth in this
agreement with the defendantâs attorney,

17. The defendant is aware that the sentence has not yet been determined by the Court.
The defendant also is aware that any estimate of the probable sentencing range or sentence that the
defendant may receive, whether that estimate comes ftom the defendantâs attorney, the
Government, or the probation office, is a prediction, not a promise, and is not binding on the
Government, the probation office, or the Court. The defendant understands further that any
recommendation that the Government makes to the Court as to sentencing, whether pursuant to
this agreement or otherwise, is not binding on the Court and the Court may disregard the
recommendation in its entirety. The defendant understands and acknowledges, as previously
acknowledged in paragraph three above, that the defendant may not withdraw his plea based upon
the Courtâs decision not to accept a sentencing recommendation made by the defendant, the
Government, or a recommendation made jointly by the defendant and the Government.

18. The defendant recognizes that pleading guilty may have consequences with respect
to the defendantâs immigration status if the defendant is not a citizen of the United States. Under
federal law, a broad range of crimes are removable offenses, including the offense to which the
defendant is pleading guilty. Removal and other immigration consequences are the subject of a

8
 

separate proceeding, however, and the defendant understands that no one, including the
defendantâs attorney or the Court, can predict to a certainty the effect of the defendantâs conviction
on the defendantâs immigration status. The defendant nevertheless affirms that the defendant
wants to plead guilty regardless of any immigration consequences that the defendantâs plea may
entail, even if the consequence is the defendantâs automatic removal from the United States.

19. The Government and the defendant stipulate to and agree not to contest the facts in
the Factual Proffer, and stipulate that such facts, in accordance with Rule 11(b)(3) of the Federal
Rules of Criminal Procedure, provide a sufficient factual basis for the plea of guilty in this case.
The defendant agrees that the facts in the Factual Proffer are true and correct to the best of the
defendantâs knowledge. Because the factual basis set forth in the Factual Proffer has the limited
purpose of supporting the defendantâs guilty plea to the charge discussed in paragraph two, the
factual basis set forth in the Factual Proffer does not purport to represent all facts and
circumstances relating to the defendantâs participation. Similarly, the factual basis in the Factual
Proffer is not intended to identify all knowledge the defendant might have of the unlawful activity
of other individuals.

20, tn the event the defendant withdraws from this agreement prior to or after pleading
guilty to the charge identified in paragraph two above, or should the Government, in its sole
discretion, determine that the defendant has failed to fully comply with any of the terms of this
plea agreement, the Government will be released from its obligations under this agreement, and
the defendant agrees and understands that:

(a) the defendant thereby waives any protection afforded by any proffer letter agreement
between the parties, Section 1B1.8 of the Sentencing Guidelines, Rule 11(f) of the Federal Rules
of Criminal Procedure, and Rule 410 of the Federal Rules of Evidence,

9
 

(b) that any statements made by the defendant as part of the plea discussions, any
debriefings or interviews, or in this agreement, whether made prior to or after the execution of this
agreement, will be admissible against him without any limitation in any civil or criminal
proceeding brought by the Government;

(c) the defendantâs waiver of any defense based on the statute of limitations and venue,
including the waiver set forth in this agreement, or any defense based on the passage of time in
filing an Indictment or Information, referred to herein, shall remain in full force and effect;

(d) the defendant stipulates to the admissibility and authenticity, in any case brought by the
United States in any way related to the facts referred to in this agreement, of any documents
provided by the defendant or the defendantâs representatives to any state of federal agency and/or
the Government; and

(e) the defendant has adopted the entire factual basis as the defendantâs statements, and the
defendant has stipulated to âthe admissibility of the Factual Proffer in any case brought by the

United States.

[The remainder of this page was intentionally left blank]

21. This is the entire agreement and understanding between the Government and the

defendant. There are no other agreements, promises, representations, or understandings.

FACTUAL PROFFER

The following Factual Proffer is incorporated by reference as part of the Plea Agreement
between the United States Department of Justice, Criminal Division, Fraud Section and the United
States Attorneyâs Office for the Southern District of Florida (collectively, the âGovernmentâ, and
the Defendant, Alejandro Andrade Cedeno (the âDefendantâ). The Defendant agrees and
stipulates that the following information is true and accurate. Had this matter proceeded to trial,
the Defendant acknowledges that the Government would have proven, beyond a reasonable doubt,
the facts alleged below and the charge and forfeiture allegations set forth in the criminal
Information. |

1. Since approximately 2012, the Defendant maintained a residence in Wellington,
Florida.

2. The Oficina Nacional del Tesoro (âONTâ) is the Venezuelan National Treasury.

3, In approximately 2007, the President of Venezuela appointed the Defendant to the

position of Venezuelan National Treasurer. The Defendant served in that position until
 

approximately January 2011. During that time period, the Defendant was an official of the
Venezuelan government and a department and agency of the Venezuelan government.

4, The ONT held U.S. dollar accounts at various financial institutions, including at
least one in the United States.

5, To meet government obligations in bolivars in Venezuela, the ONT would sell
bonds from its portfolio that were denominated in U.S. dollars or other currencies. The ONT
could then choose to exchange the proceeds from these bond sales at the Venezuelan National
Bankâs established exchange rate or at a casa de bolsa, or brokerage house. The casas de bolsa
had access to a parallel market for exchange, which provided a much higher exchange rate than
- the Venezuelan National Bank exchange rate. Because the casas de bolsa received this higher
rate, the casas de bolsa could pay the ONT at a higher rate than the Venezuelan National Bank
rate and still retain a substantial profit for itself.

6. By virtue of his official position as the Venezuelan National Treasurer, the
Defendant had the ability to influence and decide which brokerage houses received government
business to conduct these U.S. dollar to bolivar exchanges.â

7, From approximately 2007 through ] anuary 201 1, the Defendant agreed to accept
bribes from co-conspirators in exchange for selecting them to carry out the U.S. dollar to bolivar
exchange process with the ONT, which allowed those co-conspirators to obtain substantial profits
on the exchange transactions. The co-conspirators agreed to bribe the Defendant in order to
secure improper advantages from the Defendant and secure additional profits in the business deals.

8. In furtherance of the scheme, one or more of the bribe payers made payments to the

Defendant in the Southern District of Florida, and took acts and caused others to take acts in the
 

Southern District of Florida. The Defendant received the bribes from this arrangement through
in or about November 2017.

9. For example, in approximately 2010, Co-Conspirator 1 (ââCC-1â), a Venezuelan
national who maintains a residence in Miami, Florida, solicited the Defendant to permit a
brokerage house that CC-1 operated to participate in the exchange process, CC-] offered to pay
the Defendant a share of any profit CC-1 made from the business deals. The Defendant accepted
CC-1âs proposal and selected CC-1âs brokerage house to participate in the exchange process.

10. In addition, one of more of the bribe-paying co-conspirators used the proceeds of
the corrupt scheme to engage in financial transactions in amounts greater than $10,000. For
example, CC-1 purchased real estate, vehicles, and other luxury items for the Defendant and his
family and friends, many of which involved transactions greater than $10,000. CC-1 purchased
items, including but not limited to, houses in Wellington, Florida; aircraft; and horses for the
Defendantâs use and benefit. CC-1 also controlled one or more bank accounts in Switzerland in
which CC-1 held proceeds of the scheme that could be made available to the Defendant. These
accounts contained approximately $70 to $80 million, which CC-1 used to pay the Defendantâs
expenses. From approximately 2010 to in or about the present, when the Defendant requested
items from CC-1, CC-1 would send money from his bank account in Switzerland to purchase items
in the Southern District of Florida.

11. For example, on or about the following dates, in furtherance of CC-1âs money
laundering conspiracy with the Defendant, CC-1 caused four wire transfers in the following
approximate amounts from an account controlled by CC-] at Compagnie Bancaire Helvetique in

Switzerland to an account in the United States to purchase aircraft used by the Defendant, among

1}
1

others.

May 30, 2012 - $6,300,084.80

b. June 11, 2012 - $20,000,085.90

c. October 1, 2012 - $1,000,086.80

d. October 17, 2012 - $6,405,088.40

12. For example, on or about February 25, 2013, in furtherance of CC-1's money

Jaundering conspiracy with the Defendant, CC-1 caused a wire transfer in the amount of
approximately $150,000 from an account controlled by CC-1 at Compagnie Bancaire Helvetique
in Switzerland to an account at Wells Fargo in Wellington, Florida, to pay expenses related to the
Defendantâs horses. |

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Tuesday, November 27, 2018

Former Venezuelan National Treasurer Sentenced to 10 Years in Prison for Money Laundering
Conspiracy Involving Over $1 Billion in Bribes

A former Venezuelan national treasurer was sentenced today for his role in a billion-dollar currency exchange and money laundering scheme.

Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Ariana Fajardo Orshan of the
Southern District of Florida, Special Agent in Charge Mark Selby of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcementâs Homeland Security

Piro of the FBI Miami Field Office and Inspector General Jay N. Lerner of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporationâs (FDIC) Washington, D.C.
Office made the announcement.

Alejandro Andrade Cedeno (Andrade), 54, a Venezuelan citizen residing in Wellington, Florida and a former Venezuelan national treasurer, was
sentenced today to 10 years in prison by U.S. District Judge Robin L. Rosenberg of the Southern District of Florida. Andrade pleaded guilty under
seal on Dec. 22, 2017 to one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. As part of his guilty plea, Andrade admitted that he received
over $1 billion in bribes from co-conspirator Raul Gorrin Belisario, 50, and other co-conspirators in exchange for using his position as
Venezuelan national treasurer to select them to conduct currency exchange transactions at favorable rates for the Venezuelan government.
Andrade received cash as well as private jets, yachts, cars, homes, champion horses, and high-end watches from his co-conspirators. As part of
his plea agreement, Andrade agreed to a forfeiture money judgment of $1 billion and forfeiture of all assets involved in the corrupt scheme,
including real estate, vehicles, horses, watches, aircraft and bank accounts.

INDICTMENT
THE GRAND JURY CHARGES:
GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

At all relevant times, unless otherwise specified:

1. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (âFCPAâ), as amended,
Title 15, United States Code, Sections 78dd-1, et seg., was enacted by Congress for
the purpose of, among other things, making it unlawful to act corruptly in
furtherance of an offer, promise, authorization, or payment of money or anything

of value, directly or indirectly, to a foreign official for the purpose of obtaining or

retaining business for, or directing business to, any person.

2. Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (âPDVSAâ) was the Venezuelan state-
owned and state-controlled oil company. PDVSA and its subsidiaries and affiliates
were responsible for the exploration, production, refining, transportation, and trade
in energy resources in Venezuela and provided funding for other operations of the
Venezuelan government. PDVSA Services, Inc. was the U.S.-based affiliate of
PDVSA located in Houston, Texas, that, at various times, was responsible for
international purchasing on behalf of PDVSA. Bariven S.A. (âBarivenââ) was the
PDVSA procurement subsidiary responsible for equipment purchases. PDVSA
and its wholly owned subsidiaries, including PDVSA Services, Inc. and Bariven,
(hereinafter collectively referred to as âPDVSAââ) were âinstrumentalitiesâ of the
Venezuelan government as that term is used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States
Code, Section 78dd-2(h)(2)(A). PDVSA officers and employees were âforeign
officialsâ as that term is used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section
78dd-2(h)(2)(A).

3, PDVSA awarded contracts for energy services and equipment in a
number of ways, including through a competitive bidding process. One such
competitive bidding process began with a PDVSA purchasing analyst assembling a
bidding panel, which identified those companies that would be invited to submit

bids in connection for a particular project. PDVSA would then issue a request for

quotation to the companies included on the bidding panel and those companies
would in turn submit formal bids, from which a winner would be selected.
PDVSA also awarded sole source contracts, which were not subject to a
competitive bidding process. Ultimately, all contracts needed to be approved by
more senior PDVSA employees.

4. Beginning in at least 2011 and continuing until at least 2013, LUIS
CARLOS DE LEON PEREZ, NERVIS GERARDO VILLALOBOS
CARDENAS, CESAR DAVID RINCON GODOY, ALEJANDRO ISTURIZ
CHIESA, and RAFAEL ERNESTO REITER MUNOZ (collectively, the
âDefendantsâ described more fully below), solicited PDVSA vendors for bribes
and kickbacks in exchange for providing assistance to those vendors in connection
with their PDVSA business, including assisting them in obtaining PDVSA
contracts and assisting them in receiving payment priority over other vendors for
outstanding PDVSA invoices during the Venezuelan liquidity crisis.

5. The Defendants then laundered the proceeds of the bribery scheme
through numerous financial transactions, including through international wire
transfers to and from bank accounts that they opened in Switzerland, Curacao, and
elsewhere in the names of various companies.

6. The Defendants sought to conceal the nature of the scheme through

various complex financial transactions by directing bribe payments to be sent to
various recipients other than the intended PDVSA officials, including companies,
intermediaries, relatives, friends, creditors, and close personal associates of the
PDVSA officials.

The Defendants

7. Defendant LUIS CARLOS DE LEON PEREZ (âDE LEONâ) was
a dual citizen of the United States and Venezuela. DE LEON was thus a
âdomestic concernâ as that term is used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code,
Section 78dd-2(h)(1). DE LEON had previously been employed by
instrumentalities of the Venezuelan government, but was no longer so employed
during the relevant period.

8. Defendant NERVIS GERARDO VILLALOBOS CARDENAS
(âVILLALOBOSâ), aka âEnano,â was a citizen of Venezuela. VILLALOBOS
had previously been employed by the Venezuelan government and
instrumentalities thereof, but was no longer so employed during the relevant
period.

9. Defendant CESAR DAVID RINCON GODOY (âCESAR
RINCONâ), aka âPrimo,â was a citizen of Venezuela. At all relevant times,
CESAR RINCON was employed by PDVSA and its subsidiaries, including
Bariven, in various capacities, including as the general manager of Bariven.

CESAR RINCON was a âforeign officialâ as that term is used in the FCPA, Title
eet
o
4

15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2(h)(2)(A).

10. Defendant ALEJANDRO ISTURIZ CHIESA (âISTURIZâ), aka
âPiojoâ and âPaulo,â was a citizen of Venezuela. During the relevant period,
ISTURIZ was employed by Bariven as an assistant to the president of Bariven.
ISTURIZ was a âforeign officialâ as that term is used in the FCPA, Title 15,
United States Code, Section 78dd-2(h)(2)(A).

11. Defendant RAFAEL ERNESTO REITER MUNOZ (âREITERâ),
aka âNadal,â was a citizen of Venezuela. At all relevant times, REITER was
employed by PDVSA as head of security and loss prevention. REITER was a
âforeign officialâ as that term is used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code,
Section 78dd-2(h)(2)(A).

The Defendantsâ Associates and Co-Conspirators

12. âCESAR RINCON Relative 1,â an individual whose identity is known
to the Grand Jury, was a relative of CESAR RINCON.

13. âISTURIZ Associate 1,â an individual whose identity is known to the
Grand Jury, provided financial services to ISTURIZ.

14. âREITER Relative 1,â an individual whose identity is known to the
Grand Jury, was a close relative of REITER.

15. Roberto Enrique Rincon Fernandez (âRinconâ), aka âPelon,â who has

been charged separately, was a U.S. lawful permanent resident and a resident of
Texas, and controlled, together with others, a number of closely-held companies,

COUNT ONE
(Conspiracy to Commit Money Laundering â 18 U.S.C. Â§ 1956(h))

39. Paragraphs | through 38 are realleged and incorporated by reference
as though fully set forth herein.
40. From in or around 2011 and continuing until at least 2013, in the

Southern District of Texas and elsewhere, the defendants,

LUIS CARLOS DE LEON PEREZ
NERVIS GERARDO VILLALOBOS CARDENAS
CESAR DAVID RINCON GORDOY
ALEJANDRO ISTURIZ CHIESA
and
RAFAEL ERNESTO REITER MUNOZ

did knowingly conspire, confederate, and agree with each other and others known
and unknown to the Grand Jury to commit offenses under Title 18, United States
Code, Section 1956, namely:

a. knowing that the property involved in a financial transaction represented
the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity, to conduct or attempt to
conduct such a financial transaction which in fact represented the
proceeds of specified unlawful activity, knowing that the transaction is
designed in whole and in part to conceal and disguise the nature, the
location, the source, the ownership, and the control of the proceeds of

specified unlawful activity, namely, bribery of a foreign official, a felony

11
violation of the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Sections 78dd-2, in
violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1956(a)(1)(B); and

b. with the intent to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity,

namely, bribery of a foreign official, a felony violation of the FCPA,
Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2, transport, transmit, or
transfer funds from a place in the United States to a place outside the
United States, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section
1956(a)(2)(A).

Manner and Means of the Conspiracy

41. The manner and means by which DE LEON, VILLALOBOS,
CESAR RINCON, ISTURIZ, REITER, and their co-conspirators sought to
accomplish the purpose of the conspiracy included, among other things, the
following, while in the Southern District of Texas and elsewhere:

42. DELEON, VILLALOBOS, CESAR RINCON, ISTURIZ, and
REITER promised Rincon, Shiera, and others known and unknown to the Grand
Jury assistance with getting paid on outstanding invoices on PDVSA contracts, as
well as assistance with winning new PDVSA contracts, in exchange for bribe

payments.
43. DELEON, VILLALOBOS, CESAR RINCON, and ISTURIZ

solicited assistance, and in turn Rincon, Shiera, and Swiss Banker 1, together with

12
others, assisted the PDVSA officials in opening bank accounts, including bank
accounts in Switzerland, for the PDVSA officials and their co-conspirators to
receive bribe payments.

44. DE LEON, VILLALOBOS, CESAR RINCON, ISTURIZ, and
REITER directed bribe payments to be sent to various recipients other than the
intended PDVSA officials, including companies, intermediaries, relatives, friends,
creditors, and close personal associates of the PDVSA officials, for the purpose of
concealing and disguising the nature, source, and ownership of the bribe payments.

45. DELEON and VILLALOBOS, together with others, engaged in
monetary transactions among their various accounts designed to conceal the nature,
source, and ownership of the proceeds of the specified unlawful activity.

46. Swiss Banker 1 and CESAR RINCON, each and together with
others, created false justifications for certain of the bribes, including invoices for
services that were never performed, for the purpose of concealing and disguising
the nature, source, and ownership of those bribe payments.

47. Rincon and Shiera, together with others, directed the wire transfer of,
and caused to be wired, bribe payments from bank accounts which were frequently
in the name of companies other than the companies being awarded PDVSA
contracts and receiving payments from PDVSA, for the purpose of concealing and

disguising the nature, source, and ownership of the bribe payments.

13
Acts In Furtherance of the Conspiracy

48. Beginning in at least 2010, Venezuela began to experience a liquidity
crisis as the profits earned through PDVSA, which historically had been a
significant source of revenue to the Venezuelan government as a result of its oil
reserves, were insufficient to meet the governmentâs expenses. Numerous analysts
began to speculate that PDVSA could default on its debt, and the government
made public commitments for PDVSA to increase oi! production.

49. Given these liquidity problems, PDVSA was unable to pay all of its
vendors in a timely manner, but remained under pressure to continue to escalate oil
production.

50. In or about 2011, Rincon and Shiera were approached by a group of
individuals who consisted of then-current PDVSA officials and individuals outside
PDVSA with influence at PDVSA, including DE LEON, VILLALOBOS, and
ISTURIZ, referred to as the âmanagement team.â The management team offered
to give Rinconâs and Shieraâs companies payment priority over other PDVSA
vendors, ensuring that Rinconâs and Shieraâs companies would get at least partial
payment on outstanding PDVSA invoices, and to provide Rinconâs and Shieraâs
companies with assistance in winning future PDVSA business, in exchange for
providing a bribe to the management team in the amount of 10% of all payments

Rincon and Shiera received from PDVSA. The management team made similar

14
offers to other vendors known and unknown to the Grand Jury. In addition,
individual members of the management team solicited additional bribe payments
from Rincon and Shiera.

51. DE LEON and VILLALOBOS explained that the bribe proceeds
would be split and would be shared among DE LEON, VILLALOBOS, CESAR
RINCON, ISTURIZ, REITER, OFFICIAL A, and OFFICIAL B.

52. Rincon and Shiera agreed to make the payments to the management
team in exchange for payment priority and assistance in winning future PDVSA
contracts.

53. Because they were able to guarantee payment through the corrupt
scheme, Rincon and Shiera continued to supply goods and services to PDVSA,
thereby enabling PDVSA to continue to do business with such vendors who might
not otherwise accept the risk of non-payment.

54. Payment allocation decisions for vendors were typically documented
by Bariven in weekly reports entitled, as translated into English, âProposal for
Payment to International Providers for the Procurement of Materials, Equipment,
and Food in Foreign Markets On Behalf of PDVSA and its Subsidiaries.â These
documents, generally referred to in shorthand (as translated into English) as the
payment proposals or proposals, typically contained a âPremiseâ stating, as

translated into English, âThe invoicing included in this payment schedule was

15
coordinated with the international offices of procurement (Houston and the
Netherlands) in line with the agreed upon payment conditions and the operational
needs coordinated between the hierarchic levels of Bariven and PDVSAâs
different businesses to ensure the delivery of materials and equipment in order to
safeguard the operational continuity of the Industry,â then set forth the debt and
proposed payments to selected vendors. The payment proposals were the subject
of extensive communications among the Defendants and their co-conspirators,
including discussions about how much would be allocated to and among Rinconâs
and Shieraâs companies and discussions about the bribe payments due to the
Defendants as a function of how much Rinconâs and Shieraâs companies were
receiving from PDVSA. CESAR RINCON and ISTURIZ had responsibility for
developing and approving the payment proposals, which were ultimately
authorized by Official A.
Account Set-Up

55. In order to facilitate the bribe payments and conceal their nature and
ownership, DE LEON and VILLALOBOS and their co-conspirators engaged
Swiss Company A to set up Swiss bank accounts into which bribe payments could
be received and to assist in providing justifications for the payments.

56. Ultimately, a number of accounts, in Switzerland and elsewhere, were

used in connection with the scheme. These accounts were used to funnel the bribes

16
from, to, and through multiple destinations before reaching their ultimate recipient.

57. âSwiss Account 1,â whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was a
Swiss bank account for which DE LEON was a beneficial owner and
VILLALOBOS and DE LEON were authorized signers. Swiss Account 1 was
used in connection with the scheme.

58. âSwiss Account 2,â whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was a
Swiss bank account. Swiss Account 2 was used in connection with the scheme.

59. âSwiss Account 3,â whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was a
Swiss bank account. Swiss Account 3 was used in connection with the scheme.

60. âSwiss Account 4,â whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was a
Swiss bank account. Swiss Account 4 was used in connection with the scheme.

61. âSwiss Account 5,â whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was a
Swiss bank account owned and controlled by Rincon and Shiera. Swiss Account 5
was used in connection with the scheme.

62. âSwiss Account 6,â whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was a
Swiss bank account owned and controlled by Shiera. Swiss Account 6 was used in
connection with the scheme.

63. âSwiss Account 7,â whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was a

Swiss bank account owned and controlled by ISTURIZ. Swiss Account 7 was

17
used in connection with the scheme.

64. âSwiss Account 8,â whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was a
Swiss bank account owned and controlled by CESAR RINCON. Swiss Account
8 was used in connection with the scheme.

65. âSwiss Account 9,â whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was a
Swiss bank account. Swiss Account 9 was used in connection with the scheme.

66. âCuracao Account 1,â whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was
a Curacaoan bank account. Curacao Account | was used in connection with the
scheme.

67. âU.S. Account 1,â whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was a
U.S. bank account. U.S. Account 1 was used in connection with the scheme.

68. Some of these accounts were not simply used to funnel bribe
payments, but also to provide false justifications for the payments themselves. For
example, on or about September 12, 2011, a letter and services agreement was
submitted through Swiss Company A to a Swiss bank in connection with the
request to open Swiss Account 1. The letter set forth a purported sub-contracting
arrangement between Swiss Account 5 and Swiss Account | in which Swiss
Account | was to assist Swiss Account 5 in providing services to Rincon Company
1. Similarly, on or about April 19, 2012, Swiss Accounts 2, 3, and 4 sent a letter to

Swiss Company A and Swiss Account | stating the general fund distribution from

18
Swiss Account | to Swiss Accounts 2, 3, and 4 and setting forth various services
purportedly provided by Swiss Accounts 2, 3, and 4 on behalf of Swiss Account 1
to Swiss Account 5 and Shiera Company 5.

69. The Defendants, Shiera, Rincon, and their co-conspirators
communicated, including via e-mail, phone, and various messaging applications,
about the account set-up and the need to submit documentation to justify the
payments. For example, on or about September 8, 2011, Shiera sent
VILLALOBOS a message using BlackBerry Messenger (âBBMââ) stating, as
translated into English, âThe institution has not accepted the stick. They are asking
me for invoices and purchase orders. I already submitted them. I hope it is
resolved tomorrow.â The conspirators frequently used the word âstickâ (as
translated into English) to refer to money.

70. The Defendants ultimately established a complex web of bank
accounts through which to conduct the financial transactions in connection with the
scheme and conceal the nature and ownership of the proceeds. On or about
September 16, 2011, Swiss Banker 1 wrote to Shiera, VILLALOBOS, and DE
LEON to report that Swiss Company A had set up four bank accounts â Swiss
Account 1, which Swiss Banker | referred to as the âmain account,â Swiss
Account 2, which Swiss Banker 1 identified as being for VILLALOBOS, Swiss

Account 3, which Swiss Banker 1 identified as being for DE LEON, and Swiss

19
Account 4, which Swiss Banker 1 identified as being for Official A. Swiss Banker
1 concluded the e-mail by stating, âWe will email you next week the new
account numbers and the wiring instructions to begin transfer of funds into the
main a/c ([Swiss Account 1]) for distribution into the 3 accounts.â

71. Swiss Company A, facilitated by Rincon and Shiera, also assisted the
Defendants in opening individual accounts in the names of various entities rather
than in the Defendantsâ own names. For example, on or about February 1, 2013,
CESAR RINCON sent Shiera an e-mail attaching his passport and utility bill.
Shiera then forwarded this information to Swiss Banker 1, who requested in
addition a copy of CESAR RINCONâs curriculum vitae. Swiss Banker | asked
Shiera, âShall I go ahead and order a new Nevis company for Cesar?â Shiera
replied to the e-mail, noting his agreement.

72. Onor about February 6, 2013, Swiss Banker 1 sent Shiera an e-mail
stating, âA new Nevis company called [Swiss Account 8] will be formed with
Cesar as the Director/BO/Shareholder.â

Payments to the Management Team and
Official Assistance to Rincon and Shiera

73. Rincon and Shiera made payments for the benefit of DE LEON,
VILLALOBOS, CESAR RINCON, ISTURIZ, and REITER using a variety of
bank accounts in the United States (including in the Southern District of Texas),

Switzerland, and Panama, to a variety of bank accounts, including, but not limited

20
to, the accounts referenced in Paragraphs 57 to 67 above.

74. For example, in total, accounts controlled by Rincon and Shiera
transferred over $27 million to Swiss Account 1, which transferred over $10
million to Swiss Account 2, over $16 million to Swiss Account 3, and over $1
million to Swiss Account 4, in connection with the scheme.

75. In exchange for these bribe and kickback payments, DE LEON,
VILLALOBOS, CESAR RINCON, ISTURIZ, and REITER provided
assistance to Rincon and Shiera in getting paid on outstanding PDVSA invoices
and obtaining new PDVSA contracts.

76. For example, on or about October 10, 2011, ISTURIZ sent Shiera a
BBM message stating, as translated into English, âI got for you and Pelon [Rincon]
[Rincon Company 4] 1.3mm [Rincon Company 2] 1.2mm and [Shiera Company 2]
6.9.â Shiera replied, as translated into English, âThat [Shiera Company 2] is his. I
need in [Shiera Company 1] and [Shiera Company 3]. Check it please.â

ISTURIZ later responded, as translated into English, âShit, bro, I had sent it
already! Let me see what I can do!â, to which Shiera replied, âChange it please.â
ISTURIZ responded, as translated into English, âPumita! [Shiera] Relax, let Piojo

[ISTURIZ] pamper you!â, to which Shiera replied, as translated into English, âIâm

21
in need of love $$$$$$ hahahaha.â

77. Consistent with ISTURIZâs BBM message, on or about October 17,
2011, PDVSA sent $6,980,000 to Shiera Company 2.

78. After several inter-company transfers, the funds referenced in
Paragraph 77 above were ultimately transferred to Rincon Company 2. On or
about October 26, 2011, Rincon Company 2 transferred $515,513.20 to Swiss
Account 1. Shortly thereafter, on or about November 2, 2011, Shiera Company 5
transferred $179,552.52 to Swiss Account 1. Then, on or about November 16,
2011, Swiss Account | transferred $100,000 to Swiss Account 2, $330,000 to
Swiss Account 3, and $215,000 to Swiss Account 4.

79. The Defendants frequently checked with Shiera and Rincon on the
status of the bribe payments. For example, on or about December 20, 2011,
VILLALOBOS sent Shiera a BBM message stating, as translated into English,
âdonât forget to talk with your administrator, it Is vital the flow comes in
December,â which the conspirators understood to refer to bribe payments. Shiera
responded, as translated into English, âHe just confirmed youâll have it before this
Friday.â

80. Onor about December 22, 2011, Shiera Company 5 made two

transfers to Swiss Account 1, one in the amount of $299,901.85 and another in the

22
amount of $362,485.68.

81. Rincon and Shiera frequently used DE LEON and VILLALOBOS as
intermediaries for communications with or about the PDVSA officials. For
example, on or about November 24, 2011, Shiera sent VILLALOBOS a BBM
message stating, as translated into English, âBrother, Piojo [ISTURIZ] never fails.
He put mine at like $3.5M on the proposal and 5 for the ones from Pelon [Rincon]
according to what we talked about at dinner. Give him support.â VILLALOBOS
responded, as translated into English, âThat guy is good.â

82. In addition to help getting paid on outstanding invoices, Rincon and
Shiera also asked the Defendants for their assistance in winning PDVSA contracts.
For example, on or about January 4, 2012, Shiera sent VILLALOBOS a BBM
message requesting VILLALOBOSâs assistance in securing a contract over a
competitor to supply equipment in relation to a PDVSA project.

83. On or about February 8, 2012, Shiera sent ISTURIZ a BBM message
asking, as translated into English, âWhatâs happened with the Motorgenerators?â
to which ISTURIZ replied, as translated into English, âCesar must sign it! [ll tell
him.â

84. The Defendants corresponded with Rincon and Shiera about PDVSA

bidding panels as well as the official actions the Defendants would take on behalf

of Rincon and Shiera. For example, on or about February 24, 2012, Shiera sent

23
ISTURIZ a BBM message with a proposed panel of bidders for an electric
equipment panel. ISTURIZ responded, as translated into English, âGood! Give
me the panels for the others!! Get people moving on that! Look, I have all the
purchasers from my office beating them hard,â to which Shiera replied, as
translated into English, âThat is my Piojo.â

85. In addition to allowing Rincon and Shiera to have input on PDVSA
bidding panels, as discussed in Paragraph 84 above, the Defendants gave Rincon
and Shiera inside information on upcoming PDVSA projects so that they could
choose the projects that their companies bid on. For example, on or about
February 28, 2012, ISTURIZ e-mailed Rincon and Shiera, stating, as translated
into English, âIâm sending you a list of the process that we need to start tomorrow.
Theyâre processes for the E&P [exploration and production] and Gas moments. I
started with e&p, because thatâs where the strength lies! I need to know before 10
am in which processes you want to get involved in and the panel.â

86. Onor about March 1, 2012, Rincon responded to the email from
ISTURIZ referenced in Paragraph 85 above, copying Shiera, stating, as translated
into English, âAttached you will find what we are going to work on highlighted in
YELLOW. These are drilling parts and equipment. There is one from Abraham.â

Attached was a highlighted list of equipment PDVSA sought to purchase with the

24
corresponding internal budgets.

87. The Defendants frequently sent Rincon and Shiera updates of the
money they expected to receive in bribes in exchange for the payments Rincon and
Shiera were receiving on outstanding PDVSA invoices as a result of the bribery
scheme. The Defendants occasionally sent Rincon and Shiera the payment
proposals themselves, either in draft form for input or in final form so Rincon and
Shiera could see how much money their companies were expected to receive (and,
in turn, how much they would need to pay in bribes). For example, on or about
January 5, 2012, ISTURIZ sent Rincon an e-mail stating, as translated into
English, âI need you to check these numbers. They are the payments for payment
proposal. The date that is on each payment corresponds to the Monday of the
week of the proposal. The date will not coincide with the one on which you
received the money, donât focus on that, just the amounts.â Attached was a
PDVSA payment proposal document setting forth vendors to be paid, (including a
number of Rinconâs companies) and the dates and amounts of the payments.

88. In addition, on or about May 17, 2013, CESAR RINCON sent
himself a PDVSA payment proposal from his PDVSA e-mail account to a personal
e-mail account. He forwarded it to VILLALOBOS, Shiera, and Rincon with the
message, as translated into English, âIâve attached the proposal reviewed and

approved by [Official A].â The attached payment proposal included payments to a

25
number of Shieraâs and Rinconâs companies, including Shiera Company 1, Shiera
Company 2, Shiera Company 3, Rincon Company 2, Rincon Company 5, and
Rincon Company 7.

89. The Defendants also frequently reminded Rincon and Shiera of how
much they owed in bribe payments, using coded or vague language to conceal
what they were talking about. For example, on or about March 15, 2012, DE
LEON sent Shiera a BBM message stating, as translated into English, âWere you

in the names of various companies. ISTURIZ made coded references to paying
bribes in exchange for future PDVSA business. For example, on or about March

22, 2012, ISTURIZ sent Rincon and Shiera an e-mail stating, as translated into

26
English, âHi P and P, Iâm sending you the coordinates in order for you to send me

while weâre opening the other one.â ISTURIZ concluded the e-mail with the
account and wire information for Curacao Account 1.

Attached is a spreadsheet showing a summary of the payments over the past 3
weeks.â Set forth below was the account and wire information for Swiss Account
7. Attached was a chart setting forth various Rincon and Shiera companies, the
amounts they had been paid by PDVSA for a three-week period and two figures
representing bribe payments due in the amount of 10% and 2%.

Paulo!â

97. Onor about June 19, 2012, Rincon responded to ISTURIZ, stating, as
translated into English, âTo date we have transferred the following amounts:

[Swiss Account 7], 367,069.19 [Swiss Account 7]. THE TOTAL IS...USD
1,700,447.30. Paulo, the problem is that sometimes we take the amount
considering the entire payment and sometimes we need to subtract 5% for our
alliesâ... Forgive the trouble but it is being deposited today and this way we have a
difference of USD 0000000000000000000000000000.00.â

to Swiss Account 7.

100. Rincon frequently sent confirmations of bribe payments he had made

28
to the defendants. For example, on or about May 15, 2012, Rincon Company 2

transactions through which he sought to receive bribe payments were designed to
conceal the nature and ownership of the proceeds. On or about July 12, 2012,
ISTURIZ forwarded account and wire information for U.S. Account 1 from
ISTURIZ Associate 1 to Rincon and Shiera, copying ISTURIZ Associate 1.

Swiss Account 7.

108. On or about August 29, 2012, ISTURIZ sent Rincon and Shiera an e-
mail stating, as translated into English, âI am sending you the list up to this weekâs
proposal, which I am putting together. The numbers are going to stay like this!
Merry Christmas even though it isnât.â Attached were four charts â the first two
set forth various Rincon companies and various Shiera companies, along with the
amounts that each had been paid by PDVSA over the course of several weeks. The
second two, entitled âRRâ and âAS,â respectively, set forth various payment
amounts and payment destinations for bribe payments to ISTURIZ.

109. On or about November 30, 2012, Shiera sent DE LEON a BBM
message stating, as translated into English, âI have $20MM approved to collect for
this week. Iâd appreciate your help with at least one invoice for 15MM. Let me
know.â On the same day, DE LEON replied, âI'll help you with the payment.â

110. On or about February 19, 2013, Rincon Company 2 transferred

between Rincon and Shiera and PDVSA officials. For example, on or about March
11, 2013, VILLALOBOS sent Shiera a BBM message stating, as translated into
English, âDid you get the second one for Nadal [REITER]? The one for 130?â
Shiera sent VILLALOBOS a BBM message stating, as translated into English,
âThe $130k transfer was returned to me, they say that the iban is wrong. Can you
ask for it again? This is Nadalâs [REITERâs].â, VILLALOBOS responded, as
translated into English, âYes that is it, Iâm going to ask for it.â

113. For example, in or about March 13, 2013, VILLALOBOS sent Shiera
a BBM message stating, as translated into English, âBrother, I met with Primo

115. In order to disguise the nature and ownership of the bribe proceeds,

31
instead of having money sent directly to an account he controlled, REITER
frequently directed bribe money to third parties for his benefit. For example,
REITER directed that some of the money he was owed in connection with the
scheme be used to purchase a condominium in the name of a company controlled
by REITER Relative 1. On or about August 16, 2012, a representative of Law

117. On or about August 23, 2012, Rincon Company 5 transferred

REITER forwarded Rincon an investment agreement from Production Company

32
A to invest in a film, on or about May 21, 2013, at the direction of Rincon
Associate 1, Rincon Company 7 transferred $1.5 million to Production Company
A. Rincon sent the confirmation of the transfer to REITER by e-mail.

119. On or about September 14, 2013, Rincon, copying CESAR
RINCON, directed a relative by e-mail to send $200,000 to Swiss Account 8.

120. On or about September 16, 2013, Rincon Company 2 transferred

$200,000 to Swiss Account 8.

Gifts and Other Things of Value

121. In addition to monetary bribes, Rincon and Shiera provided the
Defendants with gifts, recreational travel, and other things of value in exchange for
their assistance in connection with Rinconâs and Shieraâs business with PDVSA.

122. For example, on or about November 30, 2011, Shiera received a
reservation confirmation by e-mail for a beach house in Parrot Cay in the Bahamas
made in the name of ISTURIZ, which Shiera then forwarded on to ISTURIZ
noting, as translated into English, âDone, Piojo.â

123. Similarly, on or about June 6, 2013, a luxury hotel in Aruba sent
Shiera confirmations for a number of hotel rooms, including one for CESAR

RINCON and REITER. A note next to both CESAR RINCONâs and

33
REITERâs room confirmations stated, âThis room will be paid by Mr. Shiera.â

124. In addition, on or about January 15, 2013, Rincon Company 2
purchased a $107,500 armored car from a company in Texas for the benefit of
REITER. On or about March 18, 2013, Rincon Company 2 purchased a second
$107,500 armored car from a company in Texas for the benefit of REITER.

125. On or about August 1, 2013, Rincon purchased a $10,300 handbag for
REITER Relative | at a store in the Southern District of Texas.

126. On or about June 26, 2014, REITER forwarded Rincon invoices for

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Monday, February 12, 2018

Five Former Venezuelan Government Officials Charged in Money Laundering Scheme Involving
Foreign Bribery

Charges were unsealed today against five former Venezuelan government officials for their alleged participation in an international money
laundering scheme involving bribes made to corruptly secure energy contracts from Venezuelaâs state-owned and state-controlled energy
company, Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA). Two of the five defendants are also charged with conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act (FCPA).

Acting Assistant Attorney General John P. Cronan of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Ryan K. Patrick of the Southern
District of Texas and Special Agent in Charge Mark Dawson of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcementâs Homeland Security Investigations
(HSI) in Houston made the announcement.

Four of the defendants, Luis Carlos De Leon Perez (De Leon), 41; Nervis Gerardo Villalobos Cardenas (Villalobos), 50; Cesar David Rincon Godoy
(Cesar Rincon), 50; and Rafael Ernesto Reiter Munoz (Reiter), 39, were arrested in Spain in October 2017 by Spanish authorities on arrest
warrants based on a 20-count indictment returned in the Southern District of Texas on Aug. 23, 2017. Cesar Rincon was extradited from Spain
on Feb. 9, and made his initial appearance today before U.S. Magistrate Judge MJ Stephen Smith of the Southern District of Texas. De Leon,
Villalobos and Reiter remain in Spanish custody pending extradition. A fifth defendant, Alejandro Isturiz Chiesa (Isturiz), 33, remains at large.
All five defendants are citizens of Venezuela; De Leon is also a U.S. citizen.

De Leon, Villalobos, Reiter and Isturiz are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. Cesar Rincon is charged
with two counts of conspiracy to commit money laundering. Each of the defendants is charged with one or more counts of money laundering,
as follows: De Leon, Cesar Rincon and Reiter, four counts each; Villalobos, one count; and Isturiz, five counts. De Leon and Villalobos are also
each charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA.

âCorruption threatens economic and political stability, and victimizes ordinary law-abiding people by diverting public funds into the pockets of
corrupt officials and bribe payers,â said Acting Assistant Attorney General Cronan. âThe charges announced today demonstrate our
commitment to fighting corruption at its source and to prosecuting those who allegedly launder their illicit gains through American financial
institutions and real estate. Through cases like this, we are sending a strong message to corrupt foreign officials: if you launder your ill-gotten
gains through the United States, you will be prosecuted.â

âEffective deterrence of corruption requires prosecution of culpable individuals, wherever those individuals are located,â said U.S. Attorney
Patrick. âWe will continue to enforce the FCPA against those that avail themselves of the privileges of the American marketplace.â

âThis case is an example of what can be accomplished when international law enforcement agencies work together to thwart complex cross-
border crimesâ said Special Agent in Charge Dawson. âHSI is committed to upholding the rule of law and investigating those that would
participate in illegal practices.

The indictment alleges that the five defendants, all of whom were then-current officials of PDVSA and its subsidiaries or former officials of other
Venezuelan government agencies or instrumentalities, were known as the âmanagement teamâ and wielded significant influence within PDVSA.
According to the indictment, the management team conspired with each other and others to solicit several PDVSA vendors, including vendors
who were residents of the United States, and who owned and controlled businesses incorporated and based in the United States, for bribes and
kickbacks in exchange for providing assistance to those vendors in connection with their PDVSA business. The indictment further alleges that
the co-conspirators then laundered the proceeds of the bribery scheme through a series of complex international financial transactions,
including to, from or through bank accounts in the United States, and, in some instances, laundered the bribe proceeds in the form of real
estate transactions and other investments in the United States.

According to the indictment, two PDVSA vendors, Roberto Enrique Rincon Fernandez (Roberto Rincon), 57, of The Woodlands, Texas, and
Abraham Jose Shiera Bastidas (Shiera), 54, of Coral Gables, Florida, sent over $27 million in bribe payments to an account in Switzerland for
which De Leon was a beneficial owner and De Leon and Villalobos were authorized signers. The indictment alleges that those funds were later
transferred to other accounts in Switzerland. Both Roberto Rincon and Shiera previously pleaded guilty in the Southern District of Texas to
FCPA charges in connection with a scheme to bribe PDVSA officials. According to admissions made in connection with their pleas, Roberto
Rincon and Shiera paid bribes and provided other things of value to PDVSA officials to ensure that their companies were placed on PDVSA
bidding panels and ensure that they were given payment priority so that they would get paid ahead of other PDVSA vendors with outstanding
invoices. Roberto Rincon and Shiera are currently awaiting sentencing.

An indictment is merely an allegation and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of
law.

With the unsealing of the indictment today, the Justice Department has announced charges against 15 individuals, 10 of whom have pleaded
guilty, as part of a larger, ongoing investigation by the U.S. government into bribery at PDVSA. HSI in Houston is conducting the ongoing
investigation with assistance from HSI in Boston and Madrid, as well as from Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation. Trial Attorneys
Jeremy R. Sanders and Sarah E. Edwards of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Deputy Chief John Pearson and Assistant U.S. Attorney
Robert S. Johnson of the Southern District of Texas are prosecuting the case. Assistant U.S. Attorney Kristine Rollinson of the Southern District
of Texas is handling the forfeiture aspects of the case.
The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs, the Swiss Federal Office of Justice and the Spanish Guardia Civil also provided assistance.

The Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice Departmentâs FCPA
enforcement efforts can be found at www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.

including Co-Conspirators 1, 2, and 3, to unlawfully enrich themselves by making bribe payments

 

 
 

Case 1:19-cr-20450-RNS Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/25/2019 Page 5 of 14

to Venezuelan foreign officials, in order to obtain improper business advantages, including the

approval of false and fraudulent documents related to the importation of construction goods and

materials, and to access Venezuelaâs government-controlled foreign currency exchange system,

controlled by the CADIVI, to ensure payments were made in United States dollars based on false

and fraudulent invoices and documents for goods that were never imported into Venezuela.
MANNER AND MEANS OF THE CONSPIRACY

The manner and means by which ALEX NAIN SAAB MORAN and ALVARO PULIDO
VARGAS, a/k/a German Enrique Rubio Salas, and their co-conspirators sought to accomplish
the purpose of the conspiracy included, among other things, the following conduct in the Southern
District of Florida and elsewhere:

4, In or around November 2011, ALEX NAIN SAAB MORAN and ALVARO
PULIDO VARGAS, a/k/a German Enrique Rubio Salas, entered into a contract, through a
company they owned and controlled, with the government of Venezuela to build low-income
housing units (the âHousing Contractâ).

5, ALEX NAIN SAAB MORAN and ALVARO PULIDO VARGAS, a/k/a
German Enrique Rubio Salas, sought assistance from Co-Conspirators 1 and 2 with importing
construction goods and materials into Venezuela.

6. ALEX NAIN SAAB MORAN, ALVARO PULIDO VARGAS, a/k/a German
Enrique Rubio Salas, and Co-Conspirators 1 and 2 hired Co-Conspirator 3, who was an
independent customs broker with experience importing goods into Venezuela.

7. ALEX NAIN SAAB MORAN and ALVARO PULIDO VARGAS, a/k/a
German Enrique Rubio Salas, together with their co-conspirators, exploited the CADIVIâs

tracking system by using a single shipment of construction goods and materials to submit multiple
Case 1:19-cr-20450-RNS Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/25/2019 Page 6 of 14

sets of false and fraudulent invoices and documents identifying it as a new shipment, even though
it was not a new shipment. In some instances, at the direction of Co-Conspirator 3, Venezuelan
officials employed by the SENIAT and GNB would take photographs of a single shipment of
construction goods and materials in different locations to create the false impression of purported
multiple shipments.

8. ALEX NAIN SAAB MORAN and ALVARO PULIDO VARGAS, a/k/a
German Enrique Rubio Salas, together with their co-conspirators, needed to make corrupt
payments to Venezuelan government officials at the SENIAT, GNB, and CADIVI to secure their
assistance in approving the false and fraudulent invoices and documents for goods that were never
imported into Venezuela. On multiple occasions, SAAB, PULIDO, and Co-Conspirators 1, 2,
and 3 discussed with one another making corrupt payments to Venezuelan government officials at
the SENIAT, GNB, and CADIVI

9. ALEX NAIN SAAB MORAN, ALVARO PULIDO VARGAS, a/k/a German
Enrique Rubio Salas, and Co-Conspirators 1, 2, and 3 made and caused to be made numerous
corrupt payments, by cash and wire transfer, to Venezuelan government officials employed at the
SENIAT, GNB, and CADIVI to secure their assistance in approving false and fraudulent invoices
and documents for goods that were never imported into Venezuela.

10.  Asaresult of these corrupt payments to Venezuelan government officials employed
at the SENIAT, GNB, and CADIVI, the CADIVI made multiple payments on these false and

payments were owed to Venezuelan government officials at the SENIAT, GNB, and CADIVI for

controlled by SAAB and PULIDO.

DONVILLE INNISS, (T. 18, U.S.C., Â§Â§ 982(a)(1), 982(b)(1),

INGRID INNES and 1956(a)(2)(A), 1956(h), 2 and 3551 et seq.;

Defendants.
cenit ec acy SSE HT Ee Sel Mie ee a es, Ee x
THE GRAND JURY CHARGES:

At all times relevant to this Superseding Indictment, unless otherwise stated:
Ii The Defendants and Relevant Individuals and Entities

1. The defendant DONVILLE INNISS, a United States lawful permanent
resident who resided in Tampa, Florida, and Barbados, was a member of the Parliament of
Barbados and the Minister of Industry, International Business, Commerce, and Small Business
Development of Barbados (collectively, âMinister of Industryâ). INNISS was a public official
in Barbados and a âforeign officialâ as that term is used in the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
(âFCPAâ), Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2(h)(2)(A).

2. Insurance Corporation of Barbados Ltd. (âICBLââ) was an insurance
company headquartered in Barbados that offered various financial products, including individual
life, health and casualty insurance.

3s The defendant INGRID INNES was a citizen of Canada and a resident of

Barbados. INNES was the Chief Executive Officer (âCEOâ) of ICBL.
4. The defendant ALEX TASKER was a citizen and resident of Barbados.
TASKER was a senior vice president of ICBL.

5; ICBL Executive 1, an individual whose identity is known to the Grand
Jury, was a citizen and resident of Barbados. ICBL Executive 1 was the Chief Financial Officer
of ICBL.

6. The âBermuda Company,â a corporation the identity of which is known to
the Grand Jury, was an insurance company headquartered in Bermuda that offered various
financial products, including life, property and casualty insurance. The Bermuda Company was
the majority shareholder of ICBL.

de The âNew York Dental Company,â a corporation the identity of which is
known to the Grand Jury, was a dental company that was incorporated in New York in 1992 and
had an address in Elmont, New York. The New York Dental Company was thus a âdomestic
concernâ as that term is used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section
78dd-2(h)(1)(B).

8. Co-Conspirator 1 (âCC-1ââ), an individual whose identity is known to the
Grand Jury, was a United States citizen and a resident of Tampa, Florida. CC-1 was thus a
âdomestic concernâ as that term is used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section
78dd-2(h)(1)(A). CC-1 was the CEO of the New York Dental Company and owned and
controlled the company.

9, The Barbados Investment and Development Corporation (âBIDCâ) was an
agency of the government of Barbados. The defendant DONVILLE INNISS, as the Minister of

Industry, exercised authority over the BIDC.
Il. The Fraudulent Schemes

10. From in or about and between August 2015 and April 2016, the defendant
DONVILLE INNISS leveraged his positon as the Minister of Industry and engaged in a scheme
to accept approximately $36,000 in bribes from ICBL, in violation of Barbadian law, and to
launder that money to and through the United States. ICBL employees, including the
defendants INGRID INNES and ALEX TASKER, agreed to pay bribes to INNISS, who, in
return, agreed to use his official position as the Minister of Industry to cause the BIDC to renew
insurance contracts with ICBL.

11. In furtherance of the scheme, the defendant INGRID INNES, the
defendant ALEX TASKER and ICBL Executive 1 caused ICBLâs majority shareholder, the
Bermuda Company, to make bribe payments to the defendant DONVILLE INNISS through a
United States bank account in the name of the New York Dental Company, which had no actual
business with ICBL. ICBL employees, including INNES, TASKER and ICBL Executive 1, did
not disclose to the Bermuda Company that the payments were for the benefit of a Barbadian
government official and instead falsely claimed that the payments were for â[c]onsulting
services.â

T. In or about July 2015, the defendant DONVILLE INNISS, using his
official position as Minister of Industry, caused the BIDC to renew an insurance contract with
ICBL (the â2015 Contractâ). By its terms, the 2015 Contract required the BIDC to pay a
premium of approximately 661,469.30 Barbadian Dollars, which was the equivalent of

approximately $330,734.65, to ICBL.
13. In return, ICBL employees, including the defendants INGRID INNES and

ALEX TASKER, agreed to pay a bribe of approximately $16,536.73 to the defendant
DONVILLE INNISS, in consideration for having caused the BIDC to renew the 2015 Contract.
The bribe payment of approximately $16,536.73 was five percent of the premium that the BIDC
owed to ICBL under the 2015 Contract.

14. To conceal the bribe payments, the defendant DONVILLE INNISS
arranged to launder the bribes through a bank account at âBank 1,â a bank the identity of which
is known to the Grand Jury, with an address in Elmont, New York, in the name of the New York
Dental Company (the âNew York Dental Company Bank Accountâ). The payment was routed
through a branch of Bank 1| located in Brooklyn, New York. CC-1 was the authorized
representative of the New York Dental Company Bank Account.

15. On or about August 17, 2015, the Bermuda Company transferred
approximately $16,536.73 to the New York Dental Company Bank Account based on a false
invoice provided by the defendant INGRID INNES, the defendant ALEX TASKER and ICBL
Executive 1 for purported consulting services. On or about August 19, 2015, the New York
Dental Company transferred approximately $16,000 to a Bank 1 account in the United States in
the name of the defendant DONVILLE INNISS (the âINNISS Bank Accountâ) via a check
transaction. The New York Dental Company check for approximately $16,000 was made
payable to INNISS.

16. In or about March 2016, the defendant DONVILLE INNISS, using his
position as Minister of Industry, caused the BIDC to renew another insurance contract with
ICBL (the â2016 Contractâ).

17. In return, ICBL employees, including the defendants INGRID INNES and
ALEX TASKER, agreed to pay an additional bribe of approximately $20,000 to the defendant

DONVILLE INNISS, in consideration for having caused the BIDC to renew the 2016 Contract.
18. On or about April 18, 2016, the Bermuda Company transferred
approximately $20,000 to the New York Dental Company Bank Account based on a false
invoice provided by the defendant INGRID INNES, the defendant ALEX TASKER and ICBL
Executive 1 for purported consulting services. On or about April 25, 2016, the New York
Dental Company made transfers of approximately $9,000 and $8,000 to the INNISS Bank
Account via check transactions. The New York Dental Company checks for approximately
$9,000 and $8,000 were made payable to the defendant DONVILLE INNISS. On or about
April 27, 2016, the New York Dental Company transferred approximately $2,750 to the INNISS

Bank Account via a check transaction. The New York Dental Company check for $2,750 was

 

made payable to INNISS.
Ul. Barbados Prevention of Corruption Act
19. The Prevention of Corruption Act of Barbados (the âBarbados Prevention

of Corruption Actâ) provided in Section 3(1) that â[a]ny person who, by himself or by or in
conjunction with any person, corruptly solicits or receives or agrees to receive, for himself or for
any other person, any gift, loan, fee, reward or advantage whatsoever as an inducement to, or
reward for or otherwise on account of any member, officer or servant of the Crown or of a public
body doing or forbearing to do anything in respect of any matter or transaction whatsoever,
actual or proposed, in which the Crown or such public body is concerned, shall be guilty of a
misdemeanour.â

20. The Barbados Prevention of Corruption Act provided in Section 6 that â[a]
person convicted on indictment of a misdemeanour under this Act, where the matter or
transaction in relation to which the offence was committed was a contract, or a proposal for a

contract, with the Crown or any Government Department or any public body, or a sub-contract to
execute any work comprised in such a contract, shall be liable to imprisonment for any term not
exceeding seven nor less than three years.â

21. The Barbados Prevention of Corruption Act provided in Section 7 that
â[w]here, in any proceedings against a person for an offence under this Acct, it is proved that any
money, gift or other consideration has been paid or given to or received by a person in the
employment of the Crown or any Government Department or a public body by or from a person
or agent of a person holding or seeking to obtain a contract from the Crown or any Government
Department or public body, the money, gift or consideration shall, for the purposes of this Act,
be deemed to have been paid or given and received corruptly as inducement or reward, unless the

contrary is proved.â

company, were charged in an indictment unsealed on Jan. 18, with laundering bribes to the former Minister of Industry of Barbados in exchange
for his assistance in securing government contracts for ICBL.

Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Richard P. Donoghue of the Eastern
District of New York and Assistant Director-in-Charge William F. Sweeney Jr. of the FBIâs New York Field Office made the announcement.

Ingrid Innes, 63, a citizen of Canada, and Alex Tasker, 58, a citizen of Barbados, were charged with one count of conspiracy to launder money
and two counts of money laundering in an indictment returned in Aug. 22, 2018, by a federal grand jury sitting in Brooklyn, New York. The
former Minister of Industry of Barbados, Donville Inniss, 52, a U.S. legal permanent resident who resided in Tampa, Florida, and Barbados, was
charged with the same crimes in an indictment unsealed on Aug. 6, 2018, and was also charged as a co-defendant of Innes and Tasker in the
superseding indictment.

The indictment alleges that in 2015 and 2016, Innes, then the chief executive officer of ICBL, and Tasker, then a senior vice president of ICBL,
took part in a scheme to launder into the United States approximately $36,000 in bribes that they paid to Inniss, who at the time was a member
of the Parliament of Barbados and the Minister of Industry, International Business, Commerce and Small Business Development of Barbados. In
exchange for the bribes, Inniss allegedly leveraged his positon as the Minister of Industry to enable ICBL to obtain two government contracts.
According to the allegations, Inniss arranged to receive the bribes through a U.S. bank account in the name of a dental company with an
address in Elmont, New York, in order to conceal the scheme.

The charges in the indictment are merely allegations, and the defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt
in a court of law.

ICBL voluntarily self-disclosed the case and received a declination under the FCPA Corporate Enforcement Policy. ICBL disgorged $93,940.19 in
illicit profits that it earned from the scheme.

The FBI's New York Field Office and International Corruption Squad is investigating the case. In 2015, the FBI formed International Corruption
Squads across the country to address national and international implications of foreign corruption.

Trial Attorney Gerald M. Moody Jr. of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Sylvia Shweder of the Eastern District of
New York are prosecuting the case. The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs provided significant assistance in this matter.

The Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) matters. Additional information

advisors, and others, including Co-Conspirator 2, Intermediary 1, and Intermediary 2, used
payments from RRESI to bribe foreign officials.

18. Throughout and in furtherance of the conspiracy, defendant ZUURHOUT
corruptly received confidential, non-public information related to competitors or projects in
numerous countries.

19, It was further part of the conspiracy that defendant ZUURHOUT and others,
including Co-Conspirator | and Co-Conspirator 3, discussed in person, and through, among other
means, electronic mail (âemailâ), advancing the scheme to cause RRESI to make bribe payments

Overt Acts

23. In furtherance of the conspiracy and to achieve the objects thereof, at least one of
the coconspirators committed, or caused to be committed, in the Southern District of Ohio and
elsewhere, at least one of the following overt acts, among others:

24, In or around 2008 and 2009, Co-Conspirator 2, Co-Conspirator 5, and Co-
Conspirator 7 provided defendant ZUURHOUT with confidential, non-public information from
AGP and Technical Advisor, which defendant ZUURHOUT shared with Co-Conspirator 1, Co-
Conspirator 3 arid others, even though defendant ZUURHOUT and others, including Co-
Conspirator 1 and Co-Conspirator 3, knew that the information was obtained through corrupt
means.

25. In or around January 2009, defendant ZUURHOUT met with Co-Conspirator 2 in
Istanbul, where they discussed the corrupt scheme and that the Kazakhs, including Foreign
Official, wanted RRESI to increase its commission payment to Intermediary 1. Defendant

Conspirator 3 met in Zurich, Switzerland with others purporting to represent Foreign Official.

to meet Foreign Officialâs expectations. Defendant ZUURHOUT also explained that Co-
Conspirator 5 would be meeting with Foreign Official, and defendant ZUURHOUT suggested
that Co-Conspirator | also meet with Foreign Official in order to confirm the percentage that
RRESI was willing to pay as a commission on the AGP project.

28. In or around November 2009, RRESI won a contract to supply 11 gas turbine units
to AGP for approximately $145 million.

29. Defendant ZIURHOUT and others, caused RRESI to make corrupt commission
payments to Intermediary | with the knowledge that Co-Conspirator 2 and Intermediary 1 would

scheme, As a result, on or about the following dates, corrupt commission payments were made
by RRESI from RRESIâs bank accounts in Mount Vernon, Ohio, located in the Southern District

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Tuesday, November 7, 2017

Five Individuals Charged in Foreign Bribery Scheme Involving Rolls-Royce Plc and Its U.S.
Subsidiary

Charges were unsealed today against two former executives of Rolls-Royce plc and its subsidiaries (Rolls-Royce), a former Rolls-Royce
employee, a former intermediary for Rolls-Royce in Kazakhstan and an executive of an international engineering consulting firm - all for their
alleged participation in a scheme to pay bribes to foreign government officials for the benefit of a U.S.-based Rolls-Royce subsidiary, including
to secure a contract to supply equipment and services to power a gas pipeline from Central Asia to China.

Acting Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Blanco of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Benjamin C. Glassman of the
Southern District of Ohio, Inspector in Charge Regina Faulkerson of the U.S. Postal Inspection Serviceâs Criminal Investigations Group, Assistant
Director Stephen E. Richardson of the FBIâs Criminal Investigative Division and Assistant Director in Charge Andrew W. Vale of the FBIâs
Washington Field Office made the announcement.

Petros Contoguris, 70, a citizen of Greece residing in Turkey, was charged by an indictment filed in the Southern District of Ohio on Oct. 12, and
unsealed today, with one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), one count of conspiracy to launder money,
seven counts of violating the FCPA and 10 counts of money laundering. Contoguris is believed to be outside of the United States. James Finley,
66, a citizen of the United Kingdom residing in Taiwan, pleaded guilty on July 28, before Chief Judge Edmund A. Sargus Jr. of the Southern
District of Ohio, to one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA and one count of violating the FCPA. Aloysius Johannes Jozef Zuurhout, 53, of the
Netherlands; Andreas Kohler, 53, of Austria; and Keith Barnett, 48, of Houston, Texas, each pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate
the FCPA before Chief Judge Sargus on June 13; June 6; and Dec. 20, 2016, respectively.

âThe charges announced today against executives, employees, and third parties affiliated with Rolls-Royce, is another example of the Criminal
Divisionâs commitment to holding individuals - and not just corporations - accountable for violating the FCPA,â said Acting Assistant Attorney
General Blanco. âThanks to the coordinated efforts by our prosecutors and agents - working closely with their counterparts in Brazil and at the
United Kingdomâs Serious Fraud Office, among others - these defendants, many of whom reside overseas, will face justice in this case, which
represents another important step towards leveling the playing field for all ethical and honest businesses.â

âThe charges unsealed today reflect the determination and ability of the United States to investigate and prosecute individuals who engage in
foreign corrupt business practices, regardless of how sophisticated or far-flung the scheme may be,â said U.S. Attorney Glassman. âWe can and
will follow the evidence wherever it leads - from Columbus to Kazakhstan and beyond.â

âThis type of sophisticated fraud scheme can cause immeasurable economic losses to competitive markets around the world,â said Inspector in
Charge Faulkerson. âAnyone who engages in deceptive practices should know they will not go undetected and will be held accountable. The
U.S. Postal Inspection Service has an extensive history of successfully investigating complex fraud and corruption cases. The collaborative
investigative work conducted by Postal Inspectors and our domestic and international law enforcement partners illustrates our efforts to protect
the United States and the international marketplace.â

âTodayâs indictment and guilty pleas reveal that those associated with this corruption did knowingly conspire to break the law for their own
personal gain,â said Assistant Director Richardson. âNo one is above the law, so let todayâs announcement be a warning to those who may try to
perpetrate a similar scheme that the FBI will aggressively pursue those who attempt to bribe foreign officials for an unfair advantage in the
global marketplace.â

âTodayâs charges demonstrate the immense capabilities of the FBIâs Washington Field Office international corruption program and the global
impact of the anti-corruption program,â said Assistant Director in Charge Vale. âThe FBI is committed to holding accountable those who disrupt
the level playing field to which companies in the United States and around the world are entitled.â

According to the indictment and informations unsealed today, Contoguris, the founder and chief executive officer of Gravitas & CIE.
International Ltd. (Gravitas); Finley, a former senior executive in energy at Rolls-Royce; Barnett, a former regional director in energy at Rolls-
Royce; Zuurhout, a former energy sales employee at Rolls-Royce; and Kohler, a managing director at an international engineering and
consulting firm, and others, allegedly conspired to pay bribes to foreign officials in exchange for directing business to Rolls-Royce Energy
Systems Inc. (RRESI). RRESI was a U.S.-based indirect subsidiary of Rolls-Royce plc, the United Kingdom-based manufacturer and distributor of
power systems for the aerospace, defense, marine and energy sectors.

The indictment alleges that Contoguris, working with employees of an international engineering consulting firm (Technical Advisor), including
Kohler, devised a scheme with Rolls-Royce executives and employees, including Zuurhout, Barnett and Finley, whereby Rolls-Royce would pay
kickbacks to the Technical Advisor employees, and bribes to at least one foreign official, and disguise these payments as commissions to
Contogurisâs company, Gravitas, in exchange for helping Rolls-Royce win contracts with Asia Gas Pipeline LLP (AGP).

According to the indictment, AGP was created to build and connect a gas pipeline between Central Asia and China, and the Technical Advisor
purported to provide independent engineering consulting advice and other services to AGP. The indictment further alleges that after AGP
awarded Rolls-Royce a contract in November 2009, worth approximately $145 million, Rolls-Royce made commission payments to Gravitas, and
Contoguris then passed a portion of those commission payments onto the Technical Advisor employees knowing that they would share that
money with a foreign official consistent with their corrupt agreement.

In pleading guilty, Finley, Barnett and Zuurhout admitted that they each participated in a conspiracy, going as far back as approximately 1999
and continuing into 2013, to engage commercial advisors who would use their commission payments from Rolls-Royce to bribe foreign officials
in a number of countries to help Rolls-Royce secure an improper advantage and obtain and retain business with foreign governments and
instrumentalities across the globe.

The charges announced today follow the announcement on Jan. 17, of a deferred prosecution agreement with Rolls-Royce plc and a more than
$800 million total penalty as part of a global resolution to investigations by the Department of Justice and U.K. and Brazilian authorities related
to the corrupt conduct. The agreement acknowledged Rolls-Royceâs cooperation in this case, including with the Departmentâs investigation into
individuals, and significant remedial measures.

An indictment is merely an allegation and all defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a
court of law.

The U.S. Postal Inspection Service and the FBI's International Corruption Squad in Washington, D.C., investigated the case. In 2015, the FBI
formed International Corruption Squads across the country to address national and international implications of foreign corruption. Trial
Attorneys Kevin R. Gingras and Vanessa Snyder and Assistant Chief Ephraim Wernick of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section, and Assistant U.S.
Attorneys Michael J. Marous and Jessica Kim of the Southern District of Ohio are prosecuting the case.

The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs provided significant assistance in this matter. The United Kingdomâs Serious Fraud Office
provided significant cooperation and assistance in this matter, as did law enforcement colleagues in Brazil, which both coordinated with the
Department to reach simultaneous resolutions with Rolls-Royce. The Department also thanks its law enforcement colleagues in Austria,
Germany, the Netherlands, Singapore and Turkey.

The Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice
Department's FCPA enforcement efforts can be found at www. justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.

RELEVANT STATUTORY BACKGROUND

1. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, Title 15, United States

Code, Sections 78dd-1, ef seg. (the âFCPAâ), was enacted by Congress for the purpose of, among

RELEVANT INDIVIDUALS AND ENTITIES

2. Servicio Nacional Integrado de Administraci6n Aduanera y Tributaria (the
âSENIATââ) or the National Integrated Service for the Administration of Customs Duties and Taxes
was Venezuelaâs government revenue service. SENIAT was a department, agency, and
instrumentality of the government of Venezuela as those terms are used in the FCPA.

3. Comision de AdministraciÃ©n de Divisas (the âCADIVIâ) or the Commission for the
Administration of Currency Exchange was the government body in Venezuela that administered
legal currency exchange in Venezuela, including the government-controlled rate of exchange
between Venezuelan bolivars and U.S. dollars. CADIVI was a department, agency, and
instrumentality of the Venezuelan government as those terms are used in the FCPA.

4. Guardia Nacional Bolivariana de Venezuela (the âGNBââ) or the Bolivarian
National Guard of Venezuela was one of four military components of the National Armed Forces

including Co-Conspirators 1, 2, and 3, to unlawfully enrich themselves by making bribe payments

 

 
 

Case 1:19-cr-20450-RNS Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/25/2019 Page 5 of 14

to Venezuelan foreign officials, in order to obtain improper business advantages, including the

approval of false and fraudulent documents related to the importation of construction goods and

materials, and to access Venezuelaâs government-controlled foreign currency exchange system,

controlled by the CADIVI, to ensure payments were made in United States dollars based on false

and fraudulent invoices and documents for goods that were never imported into Venezuela.
MANNER AND MEANS OF THE CONSPIRACY

The manner and means by which ALEX NAIN SAAB MORAN and ALVARO PULIDO
VARGAS, a/k/a German Enrique Rubio Salas, and their co-conspirators sought to accomplish
the purpose of the conspiracy included, among other things, the following conduct in the Southern
District of Florida and elsewhere:

4, In or around November 2011, ALEX NAIN SAAB MORAN and ALVARO
PULIDO VARGAS, a/k/a German Enrique Rubio Salas, entered into a contract, through a
company they owned and controlled, with the government of Venezuela to build low-income
housing units (the âHousing Contractâ).

5, ALEX NAIN SAAB MORAN and ALVARO PULIDO VARGAS, a/k/a
German Enrique Rubio Salas, sought assistance from Co-Conspirators 1 and 2 with importing
construction goods and materials into Venezuela.

6. ALEX NAIN SAAB MORAN, ALVARO PULIDO VARGAS, a/k/a German
Enrique Rubio Salas, and Co-Conspirators 1 and 2 hired Co-Conspirator 3, who was an
independent customs broker with experience importing goods into Venezuela.

7. ALEX NAIN SAAB MORAN and ALVARO PULIDO VARGAS, a/k/a
German Enrique Rubio Salas, together with their co-conspirators, exploited the CADIVIâs

tracking system by using a single shipment of construction goods and materials to submit multiple
Case 1:19-cr-20450-RNS Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/25/2019 Page 6 of 14

sets of false and fraudulent invoices and documents identifying it as a new shipment, even though
it was not a new shipment. In some instances, at the direction of Co-Conspirator 3, Venezuelan
officials employed by the SENIAT and GNB would take photographs of a single shipment of
construction goods and materials in different locations to create the false impression of purported
multiple shipments.

8. ALEX NAIN SAAB MORAN and ALVARO PULIDO VARGAS, a/k/a
German Enrique Rubio Salas, together with their co-conspirators, needed to make corrupt
payments to Venezuelan government officials at the SENIAT, GNB, and CADIVI to secure their
assistance in approving the false and fraudulent invoices and documents for goods that were never
imported into Venezuela. On multiple occasions, SAAB, PULIDO, and Co-Conspirators 1, 2,
and 3 discussed with one another making corrupt payments to Venezuelan government officials at
the SENIAT, GNB, and CADIVI

9. ALEX NAIN SAAB MORAN, ALVARO PULIDO VARGAS, a/k/a German
Enrique Rubio Salas, and Co-Conspirators 1, 2, and 3 made and caused to be made numerous
corrupt payments, by cash and wire transfer, to Venezuelan government officials employed at the
SENIAT, GNB, and CADIVI to secure their assistance in approving false and fraudulent invoices
and documents for goods that were never imported into Venezuela.

10.  Asaresult of these corrupt payments to Venezuelan government officials employed
at the SENIAT, GNB, and CADIVI, the CADIVI made multiple payments on these false and
fraudulent invoices and documents for construction goods and materials that were never imported.

11. In or around November 2011, ALEX NAIN SAAB MORAN, ALVARO
PULIDO VARGAS, a/k/a German Enrique Rubio Salas, Co-Conspirator 3, and a customs

official employed by the SENIAT met at a hotel in or around Caracas, Venezuela, and discussed

 
Case 1:19-cr-20450-RNS Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/25/2019 Page 7 of 14

the coordination of corrupt payments related to importing construction goods and materials in
connection with the Housing Contract.

12. On or about March 5, 2014, and then again on or about March 9, 2014, Co-
Conspirators 1 and 3 met in Miami, Florida, to discuss the status of corrupt payments to
Venezuelan government officials.

13. Shortly after the meetings referenced in Paragraph 12 above, in Miami, Florida,
Co-Conspirator 1 called ALVARO PULIDO VARGAS, a/k/a German Enrique Rubio Salas,
to report on his conversation with Co-Conspirator 3. Co-Conspirator 1 told PULIDO that corrupt
payments were owed to Venezuelan government officials at the SENIAT, GNB, and CADIVI for
facilitating the payments on the false and fictitious documents for construction goods and
materials, which were never imported. Co-Conspirator 1 said that the corrupt payments had to be
made as soon as possible or the Venezuelan government officials would not continue to approve
the false and fraudulent documents.

14. Between on or about March 12, 2012, and on or about December 1, 2014, ALEX
NAIN SAAB MORAN, ALVARO PULIDO VARGAS, a/k/a German Enrique Rubio Salas,
and their co-conspirators caused wire transfers totaling approximately $350,041,500 to be made
from bank accounts in Venezuela owned and controlled by SAAB and PULIDO, through
correspondent bank accounts in the United States, and then to overseas bank accounts owned and
controlled by SAAB and PULIDO.

15. Between on or about January 16, 2014, and on or about September 15, 2015, ALEX
NAIN SAAB MORAN and ALVARO PULIDO VARGAS, a/k/a German Enrique Rubio

Salas, distributed profits and paid expenses related to the corrupt scheme by, among other things,

 
Case 1:19-cr-20450-RNS Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/25/2019 Page 8 of 14

causing wire transfers to be made to bank accounts of Co-Conspirator 1 in the Southern District
of Florida.

All in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1956(h).

11. âForeign Official,â an individual whose identity is known to defendant KOHLER

authority over AGP and was a âforeign officialâ within the meaning of the FCPA. Foreign Official

Case: 2:17-cr-00113-EAS *SEALED* Doc #: 3 Filed: 06/06/17 Page: 4 of 7 PAGEID #: 7

use of the mails and means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce corruptly in furtherance
of an offer, payment, promise to pay, and authorization of the payment of any money, offer, gift,
promise to give, and authorization of the giving of anything of value, to a foreign official and to
any person, while knowing that all, or a portion of such money and things of value would be and

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Tuesday, November 7, 2017

Five Individuals Charged in Foreign Bribery Scheme Involving Rolls-Royce Plc and Its U.S.
Subsidiary

Charges were unsealed today against two former executives of Rolls-Royce plc and its subsidiaries (Rolls-Royce), a former Rolls-Royce
employee, a former intermediary for Rolls-Royce in Kazakhstan and an executive of an international engineering consulting firm - all for their
alleged participation in a scheme to pay bribes to foreign government officials for the benefit of a U.S.-based Rolls-Royce subsidiary, including
to secure a contract to supply equipment and services to power a gas pipeline from Central Asia to China.

Acting Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Blanco of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Benjamin C. Glassman of the
Southern District of Ohio, Inspector in Charge Regina Faulkerson of the U.S. Postal Inspection Serviceâs Criminal Investigations Group, Assistant
Director Stephen E. Richardson of the FBIâs Criminal Investigative Division and Assistant Director in Charge Andrew W. Vale of the FBIâs
Washington Field Office made the announcement.

Petros Contoguris, 70, a citizen of Greece residing in Turkey, was charged by an indictment filed in the Southern District of Ohio on Oct. 12, and
unsealed today, with one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), one count of conspiracy to launder money,
seven counts of violating the FCPA and 10 counts of money laundering. Contoguris is believed to be outside of the United States. James Finley,
66, a citizen of the United Kingdom residing in Taiwan, pleaded guilty on July 28, before Chief Judge Edmund A. Sargus Jr. of the Southern
District of Ohio, to one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA and one count of violating the FCPA. Aloysius Johannes Jozef Zuurhout, 53, of the
Netherlands; Andreas Kohler, 53, of Austria; and Keith Barnett, 48, of Houston, Texas, each pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate
the FCPA before Chief Judge Sargus on June 13; June 6; and Dec. 20, 2016, respectively.

âThe charges announced today against executives, employees, and third parties affiliated with Rolls-Royce, is another example of the Criminal
Divisionâs commitment to holding individuals - and not just corporations - accountable for violating the FCPA,â said Acting Assistant Attorney
General Blanco. âThanks to the coordinated efforts by our prosecutors and agents - working closely with their counterparts in Brazil and at the
United Kingdomâs Serious Fraud Office, among others - these defendants, many of whom reside overseas, will face justice in this case, which
represents another important step towards leveling the playing field for all ethical and honest businesses.â

âThe charges unsealed today reflect the determination and ability of the United States to investigate and prosecute individuals who engage in
foreign corrupt business practices, regardless of how sophisticated or far-flung the scheme may be,â said U.S. Attorney Glassman. âWe can and
will follow the evidence wherever it leads - from Columbus to Kazakhstan and beyond.â

âThis type of sophisticated fraud scheme can cause immeasurable economic losses to competitive markets around the world,â said Inspector in
Charge Faulkerson. âAnyone who engages in deceptive practices should know they will not go undetected and will be held accountable. The
U.S. Postal Inspection Service has an extensive history of successfully investigating complex fraud and corruption cases. The collaborative
investigative work conducted by Postal Inspectors and our domestic and international law enforcement partners illustrates our efforts to protect
the United States and the international marketplace.â

âTodayâs indictment and guilty pleas reveal that those associated with this corruption did knowingly conspire to break the law for their own
personal gain,â said Assistant Director Richardson. âNo one is above the law, so let todayâs announcement be a warning to those who may try to
perpetrate a similar scheme that the FBI will aggressively pursue those who attempt to bribe foreign officials for an unfair advantage in the
global marketplace.â

âTodayâs charges demonstrate the immense capabilities of the FBIâs Washington Field Office international corruption program and the global
impact of the anti-corruption program,â said Assistant Director in Charge Vale. âThe FBI is committed to holding accountable those who disrupt
the level playing field to which companies in the United States and around the world are entitled.â

According to the indictment and informations unsealed today, Contoguris, the founder and chief executive officer of Gravitas & CIE.
International Ltd. (Gravitas); Finley, a former senior executive in energy at Rolls-Royce; Barnett, a former regional director in energy at Rolls-
Royce; Zuurhout, a former energy sales employee at Rolls-Royce; and Kohler, a managing director at an international engineering and
consulting firm, and others, allegedly conspired to pay bribes to foreign officials in exchange for directing business to Rolls-Royce Energy
Systems Inc. (RRESI). RRESI was a U.S.-based indirect subsidiary of Rolls-Royce plc, the United Kingdom-based manufacturer and distributor of
power systems for the aerospace, defense, marine and energy sectors.

The indictment alleges that Contoguris, working with employees of an international engineering consulting firm (Technical Advisor), including
Kohler, devised a scheme with Rolls-Royce executives and employees, including Zuurhout, Barnett and Finley, whereby Rolls-Royce would pay
kickbacks to the Technical Advisor employees, and bribes to at least one foreign official, and disguise these payments as commissions to
Contogurisâs company, Gravitas, in exchange for helping Rolls-Royce win contracts with Asia Gas Pipeline LLP (AGP).

According to the indictment, AGP was created to build and connect a gas pipeline between Central Asia and China, and the Technical Advisor
purported to provide independent engineering consulting advice and other services to AGP. The indictment further alleges that after AGP
awarded Rolls-Royce a contract in November 2009, worth approximately $145 million, Rolls-Royce made commission payments to Gravitas, and
Contoguris then passed a portion of those commission payments onto the Technical Advisor employees knowing that they would share that
money with a foreign official consistent with their corrupt agreement.

In pleading guilty, Finley, Barnett and Zuurhout admitted that they each participated in a conspiracy, going as far back as approximately 1999
and continuing into 2013, to engage commercial advisors who would use their commission payments from Rolls-Royce to bribe foreign officials
in a number of countries to help Rolls-Royce secure an improper advantage and obtain and retain business with foreign governments and
instrumentalities across the globe.

The charges announced today follow the announcement on Jan. 17, of a deferred prosecution agreement with Rolls-Royce plc and a more than
$800 million total penalty as part of a global resolution to investigations by the Department of Justice and U.K. and Brazilian authorities related
to the corrupt conduct. The agreement acknowledged Rolls-Royceâs cooperation in this case, including with the Departmentâs investigation into
individuals, and significant remedial measures.

An indictment is merely an allegation and all defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a
court of law.

The U.S. Postal Inspection Service and the FBI's International Corruption Squad in Washington, D.C., investigated the case. In 2015, the FBI
formed International Corruption Squads across the country to address national and international implications of foreign corruption. Trial
Attorneys Kevin R. Gingras and Vanessa Snyder and Assistant Chief Ephraim Wernick of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section, and Assistant U.S.
Attorneys Michael J. Marous and Jessica Kim of the Southern District of Ohio are prosecuting the case.

The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs provided significant assistance in this matter. The United Kingdomâs Serious Fraud Office
provided significant cooperation and assistance in this matter, as did law enforcement colleagues in Brazil, which both coordinated with the
Department to reach simultaneous resolutions with Rolls-Royce. The Department also thanks its law enforcement colleagues in Austria,
Germany, the Netherlands, Singapore and Turkey.

The Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice
Department's FCPA enforcement efforts can be found at www. justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.

Records, Circumvent Internal Controls, and Commit Fraud)

The Grand Jury charges:

Relevant Entities and Persons

 

1. At all times relevant to this Indictment, Siemens
Aktiengesellischaft (hereafter referred to as âSiemens AG,â and
collectively with its operating groups, divisions, subsidiaries, and
affiliates as âSiemensâ), was an engineering company headquartered
in Munich, Germany that had more than 400,000 employees and
operations in approximately 190 countries worldwide, including the
United States. Siemens AGâs business primarily involved developing,

constructing, selling, and servicing equipment and systems for
national, state, and municipal governments. The company employed
more than 60,000 people in the United States, derived substantial
revenue from sales in the United States, and maintained its U.S.
headquarters in Manhattan, New York.

2. As of March 12, 2001, Siemens AG was listed on the
New York Stock Exchange and was an âissuer,â as that term is used
in the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. See 15 U.S.C. Â§ 78dd-1(a).

3. Siemens AG had a âSupervisory Boardâ anda âManaging
Board,â in accordance with German law. The Supervisory Board, which
served a function similar to that of a U.S. companyâs board of
directors, appointed and removed members of the Managing Board and
oversaw management, but was not permitted to make management
decisions. The Managing Board, or the Vorstand, was responsible for
Managing Siemensâs business operations and generally was comprised
of 10 members. Siemens AG also had a Corporate Executive Committee
(âCECâ), or the Zentral Vorstand, which was comprised of members of
the Managing Board, including the Chief Executive Officer (âCEOâ)
and the Chief Financial Officer (âCFOâ), among select others.
Members of the CEC were assigned advisory responsibility, under the
title of âCoach,â for particular areas and regions of Siemensâs
global business operations and special projects. In turn, senior
executives at the group or regional level provided monthly reports

to the CEC, briefed the CEC on major projects and other matters of

-2-
Case Pit-or-O7056-DLC Document) Filed 2/42/11 Fage 3 of 40

significance, and regularly engaged with the Coach assigned to their
area or region.

4. Siemensâs worldwide operations were carried out by
operating groups of Siemens AG based in Germany, and by an array of
regional Siemens companies situated around the globe.

5. The projects for which Siemens was hired worldwide
were typically run out of Germany by units within the Siemens AG
operating groups, with support, as needed, from regional companies.
These units within the Siemens AG operating groups sometimes took
the form of wholly owned subsidiaries of Siemens AG, and typically
were themselves split into various subdivisions, with names like
âMajor Projects.â The operating group unit subdivisions were
responsible for day-to-day project management, and generally
consisted of two components: a âcommercialâ side, which oversaw the
projectâs administration and finances; anda âtechnicalâ side, which
provided operational oversight. This dual-management structure
served a checks-and-balances function, which was also promoted by
a set of principles and guidelines to which managers adhered in
conducting Siemensâs business. One such rule, known as the â4-eye
principle,â required signatures of two managers, one commercial and
one technical, to authorize third-party disbursements on projects.

6. At all times relevant to this Indictment, Siemens

Business Services GmbH & Co. OGH (âSBSâ), headquartered in Munich,

~ 3 -
Germany, was a wholly owned subsidiary of Siemens AG and a unit in
Siemens AGâs information and communications operating group. SBS
designed, built, operated, maintained, and serviced both discrete
and large-scale information and communication systems for public and
private sector customers around the globe. SBS had its own board
and executive management, including a CEO and CFO, who interacted
with the Managing Board and CEC at Siemens AG headquarters, as well
as with the Coaches assigned either to SBS specifically or to the
region in which SBS was operating a project.

7. At all times relevant to this Indictment, Siemens
Power Transmission and Distribution (âSiemens PTDâ) was a unit in
Siemens AG's power operating group. Siemens PTD designed,
manufactured, sold, and serviced power generation equipment,
software, and network control equipment.

8. At all times relevant to this Indictment, Siemens S.A.
(âSiemens Argentinaâ), based in Buenos Aires, Argentina, was one of
Siemensâs regional companies and a controlled subsidiary of Siemens
AG. Siemens Argentina had its own board and executive management,
including a CEO and CFO, who interacted with the Managing Board and
CEC, as well as with the Coach assigned to the Americas region.
Siemens Argentinaâs principal responsibility was to sell Siemensâs
business services in Argentina, mainly by identifying and securing

contracts for public works projects.

- 4 -
9. At all times relevant to this Indictment, Siemens IT
Services S.A. (âSITSâ) was a special-purpose subsidiary created by
SBS in Argentina for the purpose of bidding for the âDNIâ or Documento

Nacional de Identidad project, which is discussed in further detail

below.

Overview of the Conspiracy

18. In or about August 1994, the Government of Argentina
issued a tender for bids to replace an existing system of manually
created national identity booklets with state-of-the-art national
identity cards (the Documento Nacional de Identidad or âDNIâ project).
The total estimated value of the DNI project was approximately $1
billion. After bids for the project were solicited by the Argentine
Ministry of the Interior, Siemens AG, SBS, and Siemens Argentina
organized a multinational consortium to bid on the contract through
SITS. Bids were submitted on or about December 27, 1996, and on or
about February 19, 1998, the President of Argentina issued a decree
awarding the DNI project to SITS. The contract for the DNI project
was executed by SITS and the Ministry of the Interior on or about
October 6, 1998.

19. From in or about 1996 up to and including on or about
August 12, 2009, URIEL SHAREF, HERBERT STEFFEN, ANDRES TRUPPEL,
ULRICH BOCK, EBERHARD REICHERT, STEPHAN SIGNER, CARLOS SERGI, MIGUEL
CZYSCH, the defendants, and others known and unknown, engaged ina
conspiracy on behalf of Siemens to obtain the lucrative proceeds of
the DNI project, and to foster future business, by means of bribery,
fraud, and other forms of corruption. Members of the conspiracy won
the DNI project for Siemens by bribing Argentine government officials.

They paid more bribes in the hope of reviving the project when, in

- 9 -
or about 2001, the DNI project was stalled. Ultimately, and as
discussed in more detail below, the DNI project was terminated
altogether. Even after that point, members of the conspiracy
continued to pursue the profits that Siemens had expected to gain
from the project. They did so through additional bribes and corrupt
conduct, including the pursuit of a fraudulent arbitration in
Washington, D.C. against the Argentine government, demanding nearly
$500 million while actively hiding the corruption from the tribunal.

20. Some of the conspirators were employed by Siemens as
executives, lawyers, and managers working on DNI project matters;
others served as agents and conduits for the payment of bribes to
Argentine government officials who were in a position to influence
the direction of the DNI project. Integral to the conspiracy, and
to the concealment of the illegal objects of the conspiracy, was the
conspiratorsâ use of at least 17 conduit entities (collectively, the
âConduit Entitiesâ) controlled or otherwise affiliated with the
Intermediary Defendants and with various Argentine government
officials and candidates for office who were the recipients or
intended recipients of bribe payments (the âArgentine Officialsâ).

Means and Methods of the Conspiracy

21. Among the means and methods used by URIEL SHAREF,

HERBERT STEFFEN, ANDRES TRUPPEL, ULRICH BOCK, EBERHARD REICHERT,

STEPHAN SIGNER, CARLOS SERGI, MIGUEL CZYSCH, the defendants, and

- 10 -
co-conspirators known and unknown, to achieve the objects of the
conspiracy were the following:

a. using cash and withdrawals of funds from
general-purpose accounts at Siemens AG to make bribe payments and,
thereby, make those illicit transactions more difficult to detect;

b. using deceptive accounting maneuvers to give
bribe payments the appearance of legitimacy and otherwise make those
corrupt transactions more difficult to detect;

Cc. using the Intermediary Defendants and the
Conduit Entities as conduits in transacting bribe payments to
insulate Siemens, the bribe recipients, and the defendants from
potential adverse consequences of the corrupt transactions;

d. transferring funds between and through accounts
held by the Conduit Entities, as well those held by other entities,
to conceal that the funds were to be used in whole and in part to
pay bribes and to conceal the identities of the parties to these
corrupt transactions;

e. creating the illusion that the Intermediary
Defendants were business consultants in connection with the DNI
project, even though the Intermediary Defendants provided no such
consulting services on the DNI project, to give bribe payments the

appearance of legitimacy;

- 11 -
Gase iitt-cr-f?OS6-DLC Document? Filed T2/ie/ii Page t2 of 40

Â£. mischaracterizing bribes in the corporate books
and records of Siemens AG as consulting fees and other seemingly
legitimate expenses;

g. using off-books accounts as a way to conceal
corrupt payments;

h. using accounts controlled by Siemens AG
business divisions and subsidiaries having no connection to the DNI
project as a way to conceal corrupt payments;

i. causing Siemens to enter into consulting
âcontractsâ with many of the Conduit Entities â which were situated
at off-shore locations, such as the Bahamas, the British Virgin
Islands, Guernsey in the Channel Islands, the Cayman Islands, Panama,
Switzerland, and Uruguay â even though these companies provided no

Initial Bribe Commitments and Payments
22. In or about February 1998, when the DNI project was
initially awarded to Siemens, Co-conspirator #3 and ANDRES TRUPPEL,
the defendant, were respectively CEO and CFO of Siemens Argentina,
and ULRICH BOCK and EBERHARD REICHERT, the defendants, were
respectively the commercial and technical managers of SBSâs Major

Projects subdivision in charge of the DNI project.

- 13 -
Gase iiit-cr-f?OS6-DLC Bocument? Filed T2/ie/ii Page 14 of 40

23. To secure the DNI project for Siemens, Co-conspirator
#3, and co-conspirators known and unknown, committed Siemens to
paying nearly $100 million in bribes to sitting officials of the
Argentine government, members of the opposition party, and
candidates for office who were likely to come to power during the
performance of the project. Central to the negotiation of these bribe
commitments was CARLOS SERGI, the defendant, who helped Siemens form
the consortium that bid for the DNI project, but whose value to the
conspiracy was his access to influential members of the Argentine
government and role as a facilitator, along with MIGUEL CZYSCH, the
defendant, Co-conspirator #5, and Co-conspirator #6, for the payment
of bribes to those officials.

24. During the early stages of the DNI project, up to
approximately late 1999, members of the conspiracy caused Siemens
to pay bribes in partial satisfaction of the commitments caused by
Co-conspirator #3 and facilitated by CARLOS SERGI, the defendant.
Many of these payments were not made pursuant to written contracts,
as was Siemensâs standard business practice for third-party
disbursements on projects. Rather, these payments were made pursuant
to what members of the conspiracy referred to as âblack contractsâ
â that is, unwritten contracts. SERGI and Co-conspirator #3 paid
some of the bribe payments themselves, and later sought reimbursement

from Siemens. Other bribe payments were made through more

- 14 -
Gase iiti-cr-O?OS6-DLC Bocument? Filed T2/ie/ii Page 15 of 40

complicated mechanisms intended to conceal the illicit nature of the
transactions and the identities of the recipients of the funds. For
example:

a. ULRICH BOCK, the defendant, and co-conspirators
known and unknown, made cash withdrawals from Siemens AG
general-purpose accounts in Germany totaling approximately $10
million. BOCK then transported the cash across the border into
Switzerland, and deposited the funds into Swiss bank accounts for
transfer to Argentine government officials. BOCK and others used
cash to make the transaction more difficult to detect.

b. BOCK and EBERHARD REICHERT, the defendant, and
co-conspirators known and unknown, caused SBS to pay millions of
dollars to three of the Conduit Entities (Pepcon Corporation S.A.,
a Costa Rican company, and Mirror Development Inc. and Finli Advisors
Group Inc., both organized under the laws of Panama) under the guise
of invoices for âconsulting servicesâ purportedly rendered by the
three Conduit Entities in Chile, Brazil, and Mexico, respectively,
in connection with the DNI project. In truth, the purported
âconsulting servicesâ were neither performed nor relevant to the DNI
project. The payments to Pepcon Corporation S.A. were intended as
bribe payments to a senior official in the Office of the President
in the 1980s and 1990s and a candidate for office and member of the

Argentine Congress at various points in the 2000s (âArgentine

- 15 -
Gase tiit-or-OiOS6-DLC Bocument? Filed l2f_e/ii Page 16 of 40

Official Aâ); the payments to Mirror Development Inc. were intended
as bribe payments to a senior official in the Ministry of the Interior
in the 1990s and a member of the Argentine Congress in the late 1990s
and early 2000s (âArgentine Official Bâ); and the payments to Finli
Advisors Group Inc. were intended as bribe payments to a senior
official in the Ministry of Migration and the Office of Internal
Security in the 1990s, and a member of the Argentine Congress in the
2000s (âArgentine Official Câ).

Cc. BOCK, REICHERT, ANDRES TRUPPEL, the defendant,
and co-conspirators known and unknown, caused SBS to transfer two
wires in the aggregate amount of approximately $7.4 million to a bank
account in Manhattan, New York, ostensibly to settle a foreign
exchange hedging contract with a foreign currency company organized
under the laws of the Bahamas and not named in this Indictment
(âCompany #1â). The payments were charged to the DNI project, even
though the hedging contract served no legitimate business purpose.
In reality, the hedging transaction was a device to conceal bribes
to some of the Argentine Officials.

25. In or about 1998 and 1999, ULRICH BOCK, EBERHARD
REICHERT, ANDRES TRUPPEL, the defendants, and co-conspirators known
and unknown, also caused Siemens to make millions of dollars of
payments to CARLOS SERGI and MIGUEL CZYSCH, the defendants, and other

intermediaries. These payments, which were transferred through

- 16 -
Gase iitt-cr-O?OS6-DLC Bocument? Filed T2/ie/it Page 1? of 40

Conduit Entities, were intended to be bribe payments to several of
the Argentine Officials, in partial satisfaction of bribe
commitments and to reimburse SERGI for bribe payments he had
previously advanced to several of the Argentine Officials; and
otherwise to facilitate the conspiracy. For example, members of the
conspiracy caused SBS to make transfers of 1,850,000 deutschmarks
and 3,582,000 Swiss francs (the equivalent of more than $3.6 million)
to Masters Overseas Corporation, a Conduit Entity organized under
the laws of the British Virgin Islands, and two payments in the
aggregate amount of approximately $15 million to Air Traffic Control
Corporation, a Conduit Entity organized under the laws of the Cayman
Islands. Siemens Argentina also paid Co-Conspirator #1, a former
senior official in the Argentine Ministry of Justice, a fee of $5
million dollars to set up shell companies through which bribes would
be paid to the Argentine Officials.

Bribe Commitments to Officials of the New Administration

And the Consolidation of Prior Bribe Commitments
For Payment Under a âWhite Contractâ

26. In or about May 1999, with work on the DNI project
underway, the Government of Argentina suspended the project, as the
country faced a mounting economic crisis anda presidential election.
A new administration, which came to power in or about December 1999,

maintained the suspended status of the DNI project.

-~17 -
Gase tiit-or-OiOS6-DLC Bocument? Filed l2f_e/ii Page 18 of 40

27. In or about early 2000, Siemens AGâs CEC exercised
increased control over business matters in Argentina. HERBERT
STEFFEN, the defendant, was assigned oversight responsibility for
matters in Argentina, with instructions to continue the DNI project
at âwhatever the cost,â according to an internal Siemens document.
At the time, STEFFEN was a senior executive at Siemens AG in Germany,
but he had served as CEO of Siemens Argentina in the 1980s and chairman
of that company for over a decade, during which time he had developed
substantial Argentine government contacts. Then, later in 2000,
URIEL SHAREF, the defendant, who had substantial experience with
Siemensâs business interests in Latin America, was appointed to the
Managing Board and CEC and given oversight responsibilities, as Coach,
for operations in the Americas, including Argentina and the DNI
project.

28. URIEL SHAREF and HERBERT STEFFEN, the defendants, led
a campaign on Siemensâs part to restart the DNI project.
Renegotiation of the contract governing the DNI project was a part
of the campaign. STEFFEN lobbied Argentine government officials,
as did ULRICH BOCK, EBERHARD REICHERT, and ANDRES TRUPPEL, the
defendants. In mid-December 2000, SHAREF met in Buenos Aires with
a senior official in the office of the Argentine President

(âArgentine Official Dâ). The meeting engendered optimism at Siemens

- 18 -
Gase iitt-cr-O?OS6-DLC Bocument? Filed T2/ie/ii Page 19 of 40

that the President of Argentina would soon issue a decree authorizing
the resumption of the DNI project.

29. Continuing the payment of bribes was part of the
conspiratorsâ effort to revive the DNI project. In or about the Fall
of 2000, as the negotiations over the contract progressed, HERBERT
STEFFEN, ANDRES TRUPPEL, ULRICH BOCK, EBERHARD REICHERT, CARLOS
SERGI, MIGUEL CZYSCH, the defendants, and co-conspirators known and
unknown, discussed the subject of bribes in meetings in Germany and
Argentina. At these meetings, the conspirators caused Siemens, and
SBS specifically, to commit to satisfying a significant portion of
the balance of prior bribe obligations to Argentine Officials A, B,
and C, among other officials, and to commit to paying additional
bribes to officials of the new Administration, including Argentine
Official D, a senior official in the Ministry of the Interior in the
early 2000s and a member of the Argentine Congress in the mid-2000s
(âArgentine Official Eâ), a senior official in the Ministry of the
Interior in the early 2000s and a candidate for office in the
Argentine Congress in the mid-2000s (âArgentine Official Fâ), and
a senior official in the Ministry of Interior in the early 2000s
(âArgentine Official Gâ).

30. At these meetings, the conspirators also discussed
the manner in which the bribes would be paid. They agreed to funnel

payments on all existing and new bribe obligations through the

- 19 -
Case tiit-er-OiOS6-DLC Bocument? Filed l2f_e/ii Page 20 of 40

Intermediary Defendants. They also agreed to conceal the bribe
payments under a âwhite contractâ âthat is, a contract that appeared
legitimate on its face, but which did not reflect an actual
transaction of business. Specifically, the conspirators agreed to
consolidate a portion of the bribe obligations into a sham $27 million
contract between SBS and Mfast Consulting AG (âMfastâ), one of the
Conduit Entities controlled by the Intermediary Defendants (âthe
Mfast Contractâ). Members of the conspiracy preferred this âwhite
contractâ device to the prior practice of making payments under
so-called âblack contractsâ that did not exist at all. By hiding
the payment of bribes through a sham contract with one of the Conduit
Entities, the conspirators made it more difficult for the conspiracy
to be discovered.

31. In or about January 2001, the Mfast Contract was
executed by ULRICH BOCK and EBERHARD REICHERT, the defendants, on
behalf of SBS, and by Co-conspirator #6, on behalf of Mfast.
Co-conspirator #5 had participated in creating the contract. The
contract described services on the DNI project that purportedly had
already been performed by Mfast, but in reality those services had
not actually been performed and were not expected to be performed.

32. By in or about March 2001, the anticipated decree
authorizing the resumption of the DNI project still had not issued.

The Argentine government was instead conducting an assessment of the

-~ 20 -
Gase iiti-cr-f?OS6-DLC Bocument? Filed T2/ie/it Page 21 of 40

merits of continuing the DNI project through a body called
Sindicarura General de la NacidÃ©n (the General Accounting Agency of
the Nation, referred to hereafter as âSIGENâ).

33. Ina further effort to prevent termination of the DNI
project, members of the conspiracy determined to influence SIGENâs
assessment in Siemensâs favor by bribing a SIGEN board member
(âArgentine Official Hâ). To this end, ANDRES TRUPPEL and EBERHARD
REICHERT, the defendants, caused SBS to pay nearly $1 million to
Co-Conspirator #2, an attorney and former official in the Argentine
Ministry of Justice who, as TRUPPEL understood, was a close friend
of Argentine Official H. The bribe payments were disguised as
lobbying expenses.

The Crisis Management Team and the Response to the Termination

34. Despite Siemensâs efforts and bribe payments
intended for various foreign officials, the Government of Argentina
officially terminated the DNI project in or about May 2001. Siemens
AG responded at the CEC level: URIEL SHAREF, the defendant, who was
a CEC member and Coach of the Americas region, assembled a âCrisis
Management Teamâ (âCMTâ), consisting of SBS and Siemens Argentina
managers and Siemens AG lawyers. SHAREF assigned overall
responsibility for coordinating the CMTâs activities to
Co-conspirator #4, an in-house lawyer for Siemens, and the SBS

manager in charge of the DNI project, STEPHAN SIGNER, the defendant,

- 21 -
Gase iitt-cr-O?OS6-DLC Bocument? Filed T2/ie/ii Page 22 of 40

who had effectively replaced ULRICH BOCK, the defendant, who was in
semi-retired status. ANDRES TRUPPEL, the defendant, and
co-conspirators not named as defendants in this Indictment, were also
named to the CMT. In addition, SHAREF directed that HERBERT STEFFEN,
the defendant, would provide necessary support to the CMTâs efforts.

35. In furtherance of the conspiracy, the conspirators
- acting through the CMT and otherwise - continued the bribe scheme
to (i) ensure that Siemens recognized the economic benefits of the
contract for the DNI project, notwithstanding its termination and
the corrupt manner by which it had been procured, (ii) prevent public
disclosure of the bribery associated with the DNI project, and (iii)
ensure Siemensâs ability to secure future government contracts in
Argentina and elsewhere in the region. The conspirators sought to
achieve these related goals by paying down outstanding bribe
obligations to Argentine Officials through a complex series of
transactions, paying down bribe obligations through a sham
arbitration in Switzerland, and seeking to recoup the anticipated
financial benefits of the DNI project through a fraudulent
arbitration in Washington, D.C.

Payments of the Outstanding Bribe
Obligations through Complex Transactions

36. On or about July 5, 2001, ANDRES TRUPPEL and ULRICH
BOCK, the defendants, met in Miami, Florida, with CARLOS SERGI and

MIGUEL CZYSCH, the defendants, to re-negotiate the amount of the
- 22 -
Gase tiit-er-OiOS6-DLC Bocument? Filed l2f_e/ii Page 23 of 40

outstanding bribe commitments to the Argentine Officials. TRUPPEL
and BOCK agreed to seek payment of this amount from SBS through the
previously executed Mfast Contract.

37. Payment of additional bribes proved more difficult
than anticipated, however, because of Siemensâs own internal
controls. To circumvent those controls, members of the conspiracy
were forced to employ less direct means of payment. Ultimately, they
succeeded, causing Siemens to pay more than $28 million to the
Argentine Officials and the Intermediary Defendants between in or
about 2002 and in or about 2007. Three of the payments towards the
outstanding bribe debt were as follows:

- $5.2 million, in or about July 2002;

- $9.5 million, in or about April and July 2003; and

~ $4.7 million, in or about January and February 2004.

The July 2002 Partial Payment of $5.2 Million

38. In or about July 2002, the conspirators caused SBS
to pay approximately $5.2 million to the Argentine Officials and the
Intermediary Defendants. The payment was made through Meder Holding
Corporation S.A. (âMederâ), a company registered in Uruguay that was
associated with ANDRES TRUPPEL, the defendant, and through bank
accounts held by the Conduit Entities. The conspirators used
fictitious invoices and an illusory consulting contract to give the

payments the appearance of legitimacy. In or about May 2002, TRUPPEL

- 23 -
sent to STEPHAN SIGNER, the defendant, a series of four Meder invoices
that requested payment for âmarket development in Chile and Uruguay,â
and provided wire transfer instructions for payment through a bank
account in Manhattan, New York. Even though SBS had not sought or
contemplated Mederâs services, in or about June 2002 an SBS manager
executed a consultancy contract with Meder, which was backdated to
on or about October 3, 2000, to make it appear that services had
previously been provided, even though no services were provided at
any time. Thereafter, payment was made to Meder, pursuant to Mederâs
invoices, through the New York-based account. Once the payment
reached Meder, a significant portion of the money was forwarded
through bank accounts in Manhattan, New York, to accounts held
elsewhere by Milmar Ltd. and Pine Top Corporation, two of the Conduit
Entities. Milmar Ltd. was a company organized under the laws of the
British Virgin Islands. It was associated with addresses in the
British Virgin Islands and two addresses in Miami, Florida. One of
the Miami addresses â a residential ranch-style house â was the same
address with which Masters Overseas Corporation and Tidwell
Investments S.A., two other Conduit Entities, were associated.

Plans for Payment of the Balance of the Outstanding
Bribe Obligations

39. The Meder payment was only a partial payment of the

outstanding bribe obligations, and CARLOS SERGI, the defendant,

- 24 -
Gase tiit-er-OiOS6-DLC Bocument? Filed l2âf_e/ii Page 25 of 40

continued to put pressure on other members of the conspiracy to pay
the remaining debt.

40. In or about August 2002, HERBERT STEFFEN and ANDRES
TRUPPEL, the defendants, met in Madrid, Spain with CARLOS SERGI, the
defendant, and Argentine Official C. After the meeting, TRUPPEL and
STEFFEN faxed a handwritten note to URIEL SHAREF, the defendant,
explaining that âthe situation with respect to the familiar themes
{had] reached a critical point again,â and that the âplan to gain
time using certain strategies [was] apparently failing.â A month
later, SERGI sent a letter to SHAREF urging Siemens to make additional
payments, suggesting that the payments would help Siemens secure
âfuture projects,â and offering to mediate the dispute with the
âclientâ âa reference to the Argentine Officials. By a second letter,
in December 2002, SERGI asked SHAREF to meet with him in January 2003
and warned of âdamage to the image and good reputationâ of Siemens
if it did not come up with a âproper solution.â

41. On or about January 15, 2003, URIEL SHAREF, the
defendant, traveled to Manhattan, New York, in part to discuss the
outstanding bribe obligations with CARLOS SERGI, the defendant.
Within a week, SHAREF met with HERBERT STEFFEN and ANDRES TRUPPEL,
the defendants, in Munich, Germany, to prepare them for a meeting
soon thereafter with SERGI and Argentine Official C. SHAREF

instructed STEFFEN and TRUPPEL to appease SERGI and Argentine

- 25 -
Gase tiit-cr-OiOS6-DLC Bocument? Filed l2f_e/ii Page 26 of 40

Official C by assuring them that SHAREF himself would authorize
additional bribe payments, and that SHAREF would be amenable to using
as a mechanism for partial payment an arbitration claim that SERGI
was threatening to bring in Switzerland against SBS for breach of
the Mfast Contract.

Payment of $9.5 Million

42. Meanwhile, however, more immediate action needed to
be taken. In or about mid-February 2003, SERGI warned TRUPPEL and
STEFFEN, by letter, that if Siemens did not satisfy the outstanding
bribe obligations by making additional payments, âwe will forgo the
confidentiality requested by the Company from the start of the
project for its entire duration,â adding that this âmight well be
detrimental to the image of the Corporation and its managers.â SERGI
was more blunt in a note attached to the letter, threatening to upend
Siemens AG's arbitration claim in Washington, D.C. by exposing the
bribery. For example, SERGI wrote that the âquestionable procedures
and criticism of the competitive bidding . . . [would] doubtlessly
generate a problem at public sector level that would make a positive
resolution of the claim by Siemens filed in Washington against the
Argentine Government impossible, and result in a loss for the
Company.â TRUPPEL forwarded the letter and note to SHAREF,
suggesting that the missives were indicative of the âpressure we are

under.â

43. Inor about early March 2003, to satisfy CARLOS SERGI,
the defendant, and the Argentine Officials, URIEL SHAREF and ANDRES
TRUPPEL, the defendants, orchestrated a complex transaction
involving two Siemens AG operating groups, an entity in Dubai, United
Arab Emirates (âCompany #2â), and two of the Conduit Entities with
bank accounts in the Bahamas, all of which resulted ina set of
disguised transfers, in the aggregate amount of approximately $9.5
million, from Siemens to the Argentine Officials and the Intermediary
Defendants in April and July 2003. SHAREF initiated the transaction
by directing that a payment be arranged by Siemens PTD, a division
of Siemens AG's power operating group. SHAREF was the CECâs Coach
for the power operating group, as he was for the Americas region.
Company #2, using wiring instructions provided by TRUPPEL,
transferred funds in a corresponding amount to bank accounts held
in the Bahamas by Chatarella Investors Ltd. and Rockney Consultants
Ltd., two of the Conduit Entities. Siemens PTD reimbursed Company
#2 for the payments, disguising them as payments related to a project
in China. Over the next several months, at SHAREFâS direction,
Siemens PTD recouped the payment from SBS, through a series of
fictitious credits for services that were not actually performed.
In or about December 2003, STEPHAN SIGNER, the defendant, told

Co-conspirator #4 that approximately $10 million had been paid to

- 27 -
Gase tiit-er-OiOS6-DLC Bocument? Filed l2f_e/ii Page 28 of 40

the âfriendsâ of the Intermediary Defendants â that is, the Argentine
Officials.

Payment of $4.7 Million

44, In late January and early February 2004, members of
the conspiracy reduced the outstanding bribe obligation even further
by causing SBS to make four more payments, in the aggregate amount
of approximately $4.7 million, to the Argentine Officials and the
Intermediary Defendants. The payments were transferred to bank
accounts held by four of the Conduit Entities â Consultora Neelrey
S.A of Uruguay, Linfarm Inc. S.A. of Uruguay, Rodmarton Ltd. of the
British Virgin Islands, and Silverlinks Company Ltd. of Guernsey in
the Channel Islands â all of which were controlled by the Intermediary
Defendants and other intermediaries. ANDRES TRUPPEL and STEPHAN
SIGNER, the defendants, and co-conspirators known and unknown, used
backdated invoices for phantom services to make the payments look
like legitimate business expenditures.

The Partial Payment of $8.8 Million, Disguised
As a Settlement of SERGIâs Swiss Arbitration Claim

45. CARLOS SERGI, the defendant, filed a formal claim on
behalf of Mfast against SBS in a Swiss arbitral tribunal on or about
March 15, 2005. The stated purpose of the arbitration was to enforce
the Mfast Contract. Although the members of the conspiracy knew that
none of the services described in the Mfast contract were performed

and were not expected to be performed, and that the Mfast Contract
- 28 -
Gase tiit-er-OiOS6-DLC Bocument? Filed l2f_e/ii Page 29 of 40

was a sham used to disguise illegal bribe obligations, none of the
conspirators acknowledged as much before the Swiss tribunal.

46. To the contrary, URIEL SHAREF and URLICH BOCK, the
defendants, provided testimony before the arbitral tribunal in which
they omitted any mention of bribery, and STEPHAN SIGNER, the
defendant, and Co-conspirator #4 otherwise caused Siemens to prevent
disclosure of any evidence of corruption in the proceedings. For
example, SIGNER arranged to have BOCK, who had retired from Siemens
by the time of the Swiss arbitration, paida âconsultingâ fee of more
than $300,000 in exchange for giving testimony in the Swiss and
Washington, D.C. arbitrations that omitted mention of bribery. As
BOCK would later acknowledge in an email requesting payment of his
âconsultingâ fee, âI have arranged my witness statements ... in
such a way that Siemens is protected from damage. .""

47. In or about October 2006, URIEL SHAREF and STEPHAN
SIGNER, the defendants, Co-conspirator #4, and co-conspirators known
and unknown, caused SBS to settle Mfastâs claim for approximately
$8.8 million. Although an arbitration settlement on its face, the
settlement was actually a mechanism to disguise a partial payment
of bribe obligations to the Argentine Officials.

48. On or about January 16, 2007, SBS caused a wire
transfer of the settlement amount into a Swiss bank account

controlled by attorneys for Mfast. The next day, substantially the

- 29 -
Case tiit-er-OiOS6-DLC Bocument? Filed T2âf_e/ii Page 30 of 40

same amount was transferred to two of the Conduit Entities associated
with CARLOS SERGI, the defendant, and other intermediaries, through
bank accounts in Manhattan, New York.

The Washington, D.C. Arbitration

49. In furtherance of the conspiracy, URIEL SHAREF and
STEPHAN SIGNER, the defendants, Co-conspirator #4, and other members
of the Crisis Management Team, orchestrated the filing of a
fraudulent arbitration claim in Washington, D.C., in May 2002 to
cause the Argentine government to pay Siemens AG damages in an amount
equivalent to incurred expenses and the total profits the company
would have earned from the DNI project had it not been terminated.
Siemens AGâs claim was brought pursuant toa treaty between Argentina
and Germany that protected the business investments of the parties
and companies organized under their laws. Exposure of the bribery
associated with the DNI project would have likely rendered the
arbitration claim futile because the contract would have been
procured through illegal corruption.

50. The Swiss arbitration settlement also preserved the
merits of Siemens AGâs arbitration claim in Washington, D.c. Of
critical importance to the conspirators was a provision in the
settlement agreement that expressly barred CARLOS SERGI and MIGUEL
CZYSCH, the defendants, and Co-conspirator #5 from âinvolv [ing]

themselves in [the Washington, D.C. arbitration] proceedings, either

- 30 -
Gase iitt-cr-O?OS6-DLC Bocument? Filed T2/ie/ii Page oi of 40

directly or indirectly, or in any other manner influenc[ing] said
proceedings, even if only by passing on information.â Once the
settlement had been reached, Co-conspirator #4 sent an email to URIEL
SHAREF, the defendant, stating that a major objective of the defense
of the Swiss arbitration had been achieved: avoiding âcontaminationâ
of Siemens AGâs arbitration in Washington, D.C. Co-conspirator #4
further explained that the settlement agreement would require
âabsolute silenceâ in that arbitration proceeding.

51. For nearly three years, URIEL SHAREF and STEPHAN
SIGNER, the defendants, Co-conspirator #4, and other members of the
Crisis Management Team successfully kept evidence of bribery out of
the arbitration in Washington, D.C. The conspirators accomplished
this by filing a claim and supporting evidence, including witness
statements of ANDRES TRUPPEL and ULRICH BOCK, the defendants, which
contained material misrepresentations and omissions relating to the
DNI projectâs origins, among other matters. As a result, in or about
August 2004, the arbitral tribunal determined that jurisdiction
existed to decide Siemens AGâs claim. In or about June 2005, however,
SHAREF and Co-conspirator #4 were tipped off by an executive at
Siemens Argentina that a high-ranking Argentine official had begun
talking about how the DNI project bidding process was corrupted. A
few months later, Argentina sought to raise a defense based on

corruption; it made reference in its filing to a pending Argentine

- 31 -
Gase tiit-er-OiOS6-DLC Bocument? Filed l2fe/ii Page S2 of 40

corruption investigation. SHAREF, SIGNER, Co-conspirator #4, and
co-conspirators known and unknown, caused Siemens AGâs attorney to
flatly deny the allegation. Ina letter filed in the arbitration,
the attorney wrote that âthe insinuations of corruption intended by
Argentina against Siemens and SITS through the filing of these
documents are completely false.â

52. The arbitral tribunal sided with Siemens AG, and on
or about February 6, 2007, it awarded Siemens AG $217, 838,439 in loss
of investment, plus interest of 2.66% compounded annually. (On or
about August 12, 2009, Siemens AG personnel who were not members of
the conspiracy caused the company to waive its right to the award.)

Statutory Allegations

53. From in or about 1996 up to and including on or about

Former Chief Financial Officer of Siemens Argentina Pleads Guilty to Role in Multimillion Dollar
Foreign Bribery Scheme

The former chief financial officer (CFO) of Siemens S.A. - Argentina (Siemens Argentina) pleaded guilty today to conspiring to pay tens of
millions of dollars in bribes to Argentine government officials to secure, implement and enforce a $1 billion contract to create national identity
cards.

Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara of the Southern District
of New York and Assistant Director in Charge Paul M. Abbate of the FBIâs Washington, D.C. Field Office made the announcement.

Andres Truppel, 61, of Argentina, pleaded guilty today in the Southern District of New York to conspiring to violate the anti-bribery, internal
controls and books and records provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA); and to commit wire fraud.

In 1998, the government of Argentina awarded to a subsidiary of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft (Siemens AG) a contract worth approximately $1
billion to create state-of-the-art national identity cards (the Documento Nacional de Identidad or DNI project). The Argentine government
terminated the DNI project in 2001.

In connection with his guilty plea, Truppel admitted that he engaged in a decade-long scheme to pay tens of millions of dollars in bribes to
Argentine government officials in connection with the DNI project, which was worth more than $1 billion to Siemens. Truppel admitted that he
and his co-conspirators concealed the illicit payments through various means, including using shell companies associated with intermediaries to
disguise and launder the funds, and by paying $7.4 million as part of a hedging contract with a foreign currency company incorporated in the
Bahamas.

In addition, Truppel admitted that he and his co-conspirators paid nearly $1 million to a former official in Argentinaâs Ministry of Justice that was
used to bribe an Argentine government official.

Truppel also admitted that he used a $27 million contract between a Siemens entity and a company called MFast Consulting AG that purported
to be for consulting services to conceal bribes to Argentine officials.

In 2008, Siemens Aktiengesellschaft (Siemens AG), a German entity, pleaded guilty to violating the books and records provisions of the FCPA;
Siemens Argentina pleaded guilty to conspiracy to violate the books and records provisions of the FCPA; and Siemens Bangladesh Limited and
Siemens S.A. - Venezuela each pleaded guilty to conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery and books and records provisions of the FCPA. As part of
the plea agreements, the Siemens companies paid a total of $450 million in criminal fines. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
also brought a civil case against Siemens AG alleging that it violated the anti-bribery, books and records and internal controls provisions of the
FCPA. In resolving the SEC case, Siemens AG paid $350 million in disgorgement of wrongful profits. The Munich Public Prosecutorâs Office also
resolved similar charges with Siemens AG that resulted in a fine of $800 million. In August 2009, following these corporate resolutions with U.S.
and German authorities, Siemens AG withdrew its claim to the more than $200 million arbitration award.

The case is being investigated by the FBIâs Washington Field Office. The case is being prosecuted by Assistant Chief Tarek J. Helou of the
Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Niketh Velamoor of the Southern District of New York. The Criminal Divisionâs
Office of International Affairs, the SEC and the Munich Public Prosecutor's Office also provided significant assistance.

16. The defendant SURJAN SINGH was a citizen of the United Kingdom
and was, until approximately February 16, 2017, a managing director in Investment Bank 1âs
Global Financing Group. While employed by Investment Bank 1, SINGH was an
âemployeeâ and âagentâ of an âissuerâ within the meaning of the FCPA, Title 15, United
States Code, Section 78dd-1(a).

17. The defendant DETELINA SUBEVA was a citizen of Bulgaria and
was, until approximately August 21, 2013, a vice president in Investment Bank 1âs Global
Financing Group. While employed by Investment Bank 1, SUBEVA was an âemployeeâ

and âagentâ of an âissuerâ within the meaning of the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code,
4
Section 78dd-1(a). In or about April 2013, SUBEVA also began working for the benefit of
Privinvest.

18. Investment Bank 2, the identity of which is known to the Grand Jury,
was an international investment bank owned by a foreign government, and had offices in
New York, London and elsewhere.

19. The International Monetary Fund (âIMFâ) was an inter-governmental
institution that, until in or about March 2016, provided financial assistance and advice to
Mozambique. To receive such assistance, Mozambique agreed, among other things, to limit
its borrowing from private lenders.

II. Terms and Definitions

Il. The Fraudulent Scheme
A. Overview

24. Through a series of financial transactions between approximately 2013
and 2016, Proindicus, EMATUM and MAM borrowed in excess of $2 billion through loans
guaranteed by the Mozambican government. The loans were arranged by Investment Bank
1 and Investment Bank 2 and sold to investors worldwide, including in the United States.
Over the course of the transactions, the co-conspirators, among other things, conspired to
defraud investors and potential investors in the Proindicus, EMATUM and MAM financings
through numerous material misrepresentations and omissions relating to, among other things:
(i) the use of loan proceeds, (ii) bribe and kickback payments to Mozambican government
officials and bankers, (iii) the amount and maturity dates of debt owed by Mozambique, and
(iv) Mozambiqueâs ability and intention to pay back the investors.

25. Each of the companies entered into contracts with Privinvest to provide
equipment and services to complete the maritime projects. The loan proceeds were
supposed to be used exclusively for the maritime projects, and nearly all of the borrowed
money was paid directly to Privinvest, the sole contractor for the projects, to benefit
Mozambique and its people. In reality, the defendants JEAN BOUSTANI, NAJIB
ALLAM, MANUEL CHANG, ANTONIO DO ROSARIO, TEOFILO NHANGUMELE,
ANDREW PEARSE, SURJAN SINGH and DETELINA SUBEVA, together with others,
created the maritime projects as fronts to raise money to enrich themselves and intentionally
diverted portions of the loan proceeds to pay at least $200 million in bribes and kickbacks to

themselves, Mozambican government officials and others.
26. The co-conspirators applied only a portion of the loan proceeds towards
the maritime projects. In furtherance of the scheme, Privinvest charged inflated prices for
the equipment and services it provided, which were then used, at least in part, to pay bribes
and kickbacks. After conducting little or no business activity, Proindicus, EMATUM and
MAM each defaulted on their loans.

B. Relevant Internal Accounting Controls of Investment Bank 1

27. The FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Sections 78m(b)(2)(B),
78m(b)(4), 78(b)(5) and 78ff(a) required issuers to maintain a system of sufficient internal
accounting controls and made it illegal to knowingly and willfully circumvent such controls.

28. Investment Bank 1 had internal accounting controls (âinternal
controlsâ) that addressed, among other things, the prevention of bribery of and by Investment
Bank 1 employees; the prevention of money laundering and other financial crimes; conflicts
of interests; outside employment; and the use of intermediaries in financial transactions.
Investment Bank 1âs compliance department exercised primary responsibility for overseeing
and enforcing Investment Bank 1âs internal controls.

29. Within Investment Bank 1, the group of investment bankers assigned to
a specific transaction was called the âdeal team.â The defendants ANDREW PEARSE,
SURJAN SINGH and DETELINA SUBEVA were part of the deal team on the Proindicus
project and SINGH was a member of the deal team on the EMATUM project. They
received regular training on Investment Bank 1âs internal controls and were also aware of

. those internal controls through their involvement in numerous transactions.

C. The Proindicus Project

30. Onor about January 18, 2013, Privinvest entered into a $366 million
contract with Proindicus to supply materials and training to protect Mozambiqueâs territorial
waters. On or about February 28, 2013, pursuant to a written loan agreement, Investment
Bank 1 agreed to arrange a $372 million syndicated loan to Proindicus, guaranteed by the
Republic of Mozambique (the âProindicus Loanâ). The defendant SURJAN SINGH signed
the loan agreement on behalf of Investment Bank 1, the defendant ANTONIO DO
ROSARIO co-signed on behalf of Proindicus and the defendant MANUEL CHANG signed
the government guarantee for the loan on behalf of Mozambique. Between approximately
June and August 2013, Investment Bank | increased the Proindicus Loan by approximately
$132 million. On or about November 15, 2013, Investment Bank 2 further increased the
Proindicus Loan by $118 million, bringing the total loaned amount to $622 million.
Proindicus never conducted significant operations or generated significant revenue and
defaulted on its loan payment due on or about March 21, 2017.

(1) Bribery of Mozambican Government Officials to Gain Approval for the
Proindicus Project

31. Beginning in or about 2011, the defendant JEAN BOUSTANI, through
discussions with the defendant TEOFILO NHANGUMELE arranged by Privinvest Co-
Conspirator 1, attempted to persuade Mozambican government officials to establish a coastal
monitoring system through a contract with Privinvest. Almost immediately, BOUSTANI
and NHANGUMELE negotiated the first round of bribe and kickback payments that

Privinvest would have to make for the benefit of Mozambican government officials for the
project to be approved. For example, in furtherance of the scheme, BOUSTANI,
NHANGUMELE and other co-conspirators had the following discussions:

(a) | Onor about November 11, 2011, NHANGUMELE wrote to
BOUSTANI by email, stating: âTo secure that the project is granted a go-ahead by the HoS
[Head of State], a payment has to be agreed before we get there, so that we know and agree,
well in advance, what ought to be paid and when. Whatever advance payments to be paid
before the project, they can be built in the project, and recovered.â

(b) Later on or about the same day, November 11, 2011,
BOUSTANI wrote to NHANGUMELE by email, stating: âA very important issue which
needs to be clear: we had various negative experiences in Africa. Especially related to the
âsuccess feesâ payments. Therefore, we have a strict policy in the Group consisting of not
disbursing any âsuccess feeâ before the signature of the Project Contract.â

(c) | Onor about November 14, 2011, NHANGUMELE responded
by email to BOUSTANI, stating: âFabulous, I agree with you in principle. Let us agree and
look at project in two distinct moments. One moment is to massage the system and get the
political will to go ahead with the project. The second moment is the project
implementation/execution. I agree with you that any monies can only be paid after the
project signing. This has to be treated separately from the project implementation .. .
Because for the project implementation there will be other players whose interest will have to
be looked after e.g. ministry of defense, ministry of interior, air force, etc. . . . in democratic
governments like ours people come and go, and everyone involved will want to have his/her

share of the deal while in office, because once out of the office it will be difficult. So, it is
important that the contract signing success fee be agreed and paid in once-off, upon the
signing of the contract.â
32. Soon thereafter, during an email exchange on or about December 28,

2011, the defendants JEAN BOUSTANI and TEOFILO NHANGUMELE agreed to $50
million in bribe and kickback payments to Mozambican government officials and $12
million in kickbacks for Privinvest co-conspirators. For example:

(a) On or about December 28, 2011, in response to an email from
BOUSTANI requesting a bribe and kickback figure, NHANGUMELE wrote: âFine brother.
I have consulted and please put 50 million chickens. Whatever numbers you have on your
poultry I will add 50 million of my breed.â

(b) Onor about the same day, BOUSTANI forwarded this email to
Privinvest personnel, stating, âSOM for them and 12M for [Privinvest Co-Conspirator 1]
(5%) ==> total of 62M on top.â

33. After more than a year of negotiations, on or about January 18, 2013,

Privinvest and Proindicus signed a $366 million contract for Privinvest to provide a coastal
monitoring system to Mozambique. Five days later, on or about January 23, 2013, the
defendant JEAN BOUSTANI instructed a bank in the UAE to make payments to the
defendant TEOFILO NHANGUMELE and Mozambican Co-Conspirator 1. The
instructions ordered the bank, in relevant part: âUpon receipt by Privinvest Shipbuilding of a
minimum amount of US$ 317,000,000 . . . to pay immediately: a. Teofilo Nhangumele the
sum of US$ 5,100,000 . . . and b. [Mozambican Co-Conspirator 1] the sum of
US$ 5,100,000.â The instructions also ordered the bank to pay NHANGUMELE and

Mozambican Co-Conspirator 1 an additional approximately $3.4 million each at later dates.

10
(2) Bribery to Gain Mozambiqueâs Government Guarantee for the
Proindicus Financing

34. | At the same time as the defendants JEAN BOUSTANI and TEOFILO
NHANGUMELE were negotiating bribe payments to cause Mozambican government
officials to approve the Proindicus project, BOUSTANI recruited Investment Bank 1 to
arrange financing for the project. During negotiations, bankers at Investment Bank 1 made
clear that Investment Bank 1 would only arrange a loan that was at or near market interest
rates, with debt that was either directly issued by the Government of Mozambique or
guaranteed by the government.

35. To further negotiations on the Proindicus project, on or about
September 13, 2012, the defendant ANDREW PEARSE traveled to the UAE to meet with
the defendants JEAN BOUSTANI and TEOFILO NHANGUMELE and a close relative of a
senior Mozambican government official, among others.

36. Tohelp obtain Mozambiqueâs agreement to Investment Bank 1âs terms,
including that any loan be at or near market rates and guaranteed by the Mozambican
government, the defendants JEAN BOUSTANI and TEOFILO NHANGUMELE enlisted the
defendant MANUEL CHANG, Mozambiqueâs Minister of Finance. On or about December
22, 2012, CHANG wrote a letter to Privinvest Co-Conspirator 2, which was forwarded to an
employee of Investment Bank 1 (âInvestment Bank 1 Employee 1â), an individual whose
identity is known to the Grand Jury, explaining that âthe financing of this project is still
constrained by the IMF imposed limitation on the Government for Mozambique to accept
commercial credit for commercial projects. Therefore, we have devised an alternative

solution whereby an SPV [Special Purpose Vehicle] . . . will be formed.â

11
37. | Onor about December 26, 2012, the defendant JEAN BOUSTANI sent
an email to the defendant TEOFILO NHANGUMELE in preparation for a meeting in
Mozambique between employees of Investment Bank 1, Privinvest and Proindicus to
negotiate the terms of the transaction. In the email, BOUSTANI emphasized: âBut the only
imperative matter for [Investment Bank 1] bro is [the defendant MANUEL CHANGâs]
signature of the guarantee for the loan.â

38. | Onor about February 28, 2013, the defendant MANUEL CHANG
signed the guarantee for the Proindicus Loan. In or about and between October 2013 and
December 2013, the defendants JEAN BOUSTANI and NAJIB ALLAM, along with others,
paid at least $5 million in bribe and kickback payments for the benefit of CHANG from a
bank account in the UAE, through the United States, to a bank account in Spain.

(3) Conspiracy to Circumvent Investment Bank 1âs Internal Controls and
Win Business for Investment Bank | in Connection with the Proindicus

Project, Including Paying Bribes to Mozambican Government Officials

39. | While negotiations over the Proindicus financings proceeded in 2012
and early 2013, the defendants ANDREW PEARSE, SURJAN SINGH and DETELINA
SUBEVA, together with others, conspired to circumvent Investment Bank 1âs internal
controls to enrich themselves and win the Proindicus business for Investment Bank 1,
including through the payment of bribes to Mozambican government officials. At the time,
PEARSE, SINGH and SUBEVA were agents acting within the scope of their employment on
behalf of Investment Bank 1, with the intent, at least in part, to benefit Investment Bank 1.

40. Investment Bank 1âs internal controls required employees, including
the compliance department and the deal team, to evaluate the potential for corruption related

to the Proindicus project and the Mozambican government officials who would be involved

12
in running it. Investment Bank 1âs review process identified certain red flags concerning the
proposed Proindicus transaction at an early stage. On or about March 9, 2012, in response
to a question from Investment Bank 1 Employee 1 as to whether there was a competitive
bidding process that resulted in Privinvest being selected, the defendant JEAN BOUSTANI
replied by email, copying the defendant SURJAN SINGH, that the selection of Privinvest
had not resulted from a competitive bid and that the deal had come about due to âhigh level
connectionsâ between Privinvest and the Mozambican government.

41.  JInor about March 2012, in anticipation of arranging financing for the
Proindicus project, Investment Bank 1 employees began conducting due diligence, or
research, on the parties involved in the project. Accordingly, as early as approximately
March 12, 2012, Investment Bank 1 employees identified allegations of corruption
associated with Privinvest Co-Conspirator 2. On that day, Investment Bank 1 Employee 1
reported to his superior and the defendant SURJAN SINGH that Investment Bank 1 had
previously designated Privinvest Co-Conspirator 2 as âan undesirable client.â Furthermore,
on or about March 13, 2012, Investment Bank 1 Employee 1 began collecting approximately
10 news articles containing potentially derogatory information regarding Privinvest Co-
Conspirator 2, and exchanged emails with SINGH regarding the information and articles.

42. Notwithstanding the existence of such red flags, while conducting due
diligence on the Proindicus transaction as required by Investment Bank 1âs internal controls,
the defendants ANDREW PEARSE, SURJAN SINGH and DETELINA SUBEVA withheld
information about the likelihood of corruption connected to the Proindicus transaction from
Investment Bank 1âs compliance department. For instance, in or about November 2012, at

the direction of the head of Investment Bank 1âs compliance department, members of the

13
Proindicus deal team consulted with a senior executive for Investment Bank 1âs Europe,
Middle East and Africa (âEMEAâ) region (the âEMEA Executiveâ), an individual whose
identity is known to the Grand Jury, regarding any legal or reputational concerns that the
Proindicus transaction might raise for the bank. On or about November 19, 2012, PEARSE
summarized those discussions in an email he sent to Investment Bank 1 Employee 1, writing
that the EMEA Executive âsaid no to the combination of Moz[ambique] and your friend
[Privinvest Co-Conspirator 2], so we need to structure him out of the picture.â Similarly,
Investment Bank | maintained a report in its due diligence files describing Privinvest Co-
Conspirator 2 as a âmaster of kickbacks.â Despite such information, PEARSE, SINGH and
Investment Bank 1 Employee 1 all failed to relay the EMEA Executiveâs concerns to
Investment Bank 1âs compliance department, and the compliance department failed to pursue
its inquiry further.

43. Furthermore, the defendants ANDREW PEARSE, SURJAN SINGH
and DETELINA SUBEVA conspired to withhold from Investment Bank 1âs compliance
department that Privinvest and Proindicus sought to appoint an individual in Mozambique
who had previously been involved in fraudulent conduct to Proindicusâs Board of Directors.
Specifically, even though Investment Bank 1 compliance personnel were responsible for
choosing an external firm to perform due diligence on Proindicusâs officers and directors, in
or about February 2013, the defendants ANDREW PEARSE, DETELINA SUBEVA and
SURJAN SINGH secretly selected a due diligence firm (âDue Diligence Firm 1â), the
identity of which is known to the Grand Jury, to research the transaction and pre-screen the
individuals identified as directors of Proindicus to secure approval by Investment Bank 1

compliance personnel.

14
44, [nor around February 2013, Due Diligence Firm 1 reported to the
defendants ANDREW PEARSE, SURJAN SINGH and DETELINA SUBEVA that one of
the proposed directors of Proindicus had previously been involved in fraudulent conduct
while he was an officer of a Mozambican state-owned company. PEARSE, SINGH and
SUBEVA did not share this information with Investment Bank 1âs compliance department.
Instead, PEARSE, SINGH and SUBEVA obtained a replacement group of directors, which
included the defendant ANTONIO DO ROSARIO, from Privinvest and Proindicus and asked
Due Diligence Firm 1 for a background investigation onthem. Due Diligence Firm 1
reported fewer red flags related to the second group of directors.

45. On or about February 26, 2013, having pre-cleared the second group of
Proindicus directors and without revealing that two separate groups of directors had been
researched, the defendant DETELINA SUBEVA forwarded the names of the second group
of proposed directors to Investment Bank 1âs compliance department for due diligence by the
firm that the compliance department had selected (âDue Diligence Firm 2â), the identity of
which is known to the Grand Jury. After reviewing a report from Due Diligence Firm 2, the
compliance department approved the new group of directors.

(4) Conspiracy to Remove or Modify Conditions on the Proindicus Loan that
Had Been Consistent with Investment Bank 1âs Internal Controls

46. As part of its system of internal controls, Investment Bank 1 imposed
conditions that Mozambique would have to meet to receive a loan. Some of those
conditions, however, carried a risk of exposing the existence of the Proindicus project to the
Mozambican public and members of Mozambiqueâs government beyond the circle of

government officials who were part of the fraudulent scheme. To conceal the fraudulent

15
scheme, avoid scrutiny and help win business for Investment Bank 1, the defendants
ANDREW PEARSE, SURJAN SINGH and DETELINA SUBEVA, together with others,
removed some of Investment Bank 1âs conditions for the Proindicus Loan.

47. For example, Investment Bank 1 originally had required Proindicus to
provide an opinion from the Attorney General of Mozambique concerning the validity of the
government guarantee. On or about February 18, 2013, the defendant JEAN BOUSTANI,
on behalf of both Privinvest and Mozambique, strenuously objected, explaining to the
defendant DETELINA SUBEVA in an email: â[T]he attorney general opinion is not
mandatory . . . I believe that this will not be accepted by Proindicus since its owner wanted to
bypass public tender and normal bureaucratic procedures from day 1 by creating a private
entity!! So they will never accept to inform the attorney general!! The [Minister of

39

Finance] guarantee is legally covered by a presidential decree.â On or before February 28,
2013, the defendants ANDREW PEARSE, SURJAN SINGH and SUBEVA, together with
others, ultimately removed the requirement from the conditions Investment Bank 1 had
imposed.

48. Similarly, on or about February 25, 2013, the defendants ANDREW
PEARSE, SURJAN SINGH and DETELINA SUBEVA, together with others, removed
Investment Bank 1âs condition that Mozambique inform the IMF of the loan. PEARSE,
SINGH and SUBEVA replaced that condition with the less stringent requirement that
Mozambique represent to investors âthat they [were] in compliance with their IMF and

World Bank obligations.â In fact, the IMF was not informed of the Proindicus Loan at the

time of the transaction. Indeed, the IMF learned of the transaction only in or about 2016,

16
when its exposure contributed to the IMFâs decision to cease providing aid and financing to
Mozambique and caused a severe financial crisis in Mozambique.

(5) The Proindicus Loan and Recruiting of Investors in the United States

49. After Investment Bank 1âs compliance department approved the
transaction on or about March 20, 2013, Investment Bank J agreed to arrange a $372 million
syndicated loan to Proindicus, guaranteed by the Republic of Mozambique, pursuant to a
written loan agreement. The defendant SURJAN SINGH signed the loan agreement on
behalf of Investment Bank 1, the defendant ANTONIO DO ROSARIO co-signed on behalf
of Proindicus and the defendant MANUEL CHANG signed the government guarantee on
behalf of Mozambique.

50. The Proindicus loan agreement provided that all payments by the
borrower or the lenders would be paid to Investment Bank 1âs bank account at a New York
City-based financial institution (âNew York City Bank 1â), the identity of which is known to
the Grand Jury. The loan agreement also required Proindicus to âapply all amounts
borrowed by it under the Facility towards the financing of the Project.â Furthermore, the
loan agreement prohibited improper payments in connection with the Proindicus project,
including payments that would violate the FCPA, the United Kingdomâs Bribery Act (âUK
Bribery Actâ) and the Mozambican Anti-Corruption Law.

| 51. Onor about March 21, 2013, Investment Bank 1 transferred the entire
proceeds of the loan, less fees totaling approximately $44 million, through a bank account at
New York City Bank 1, directly to a bank account held by Privinvest at a bank in Abu Dhabi,
UAE (âUAE Bank 1â), the identity of which is known to the Grand Jury. âInvestment Bank

1 immediately solicited United States-based investors to participate in the loan, in part by

17
sending them electronically, among other things, the Proindicus loan agreement and a
confidential information memorandum that summarized its terms.

(6) Proindicus Loan Increase and Bribe and Kickback Payments to PEARSE
and SUBEVA

52. Onor about March 28, 2013, the defendant ANDREW PEARSE
notified the defendants SURJAN SINGH and DETELINA SUBEVA and others at
Investment Bank 1 that Proindicus sought to borrow an additional $250 million from
Investment Bank 1.

53. Onor about June 13, 2013, the defendant MANUEL CHANG signed,
on behalf of Mozambique, a government guarantee for an additional $250 million in
borrowing by Proindicus. One day later, on or about June 14, 2013, Investment Bank | and
Proindicus amended their loan agreement to permit Proindicus to borrow up to an additional
$250 million from Investment Bank 1.

54. Even though Proindicus had conducted no operations, on or about June
23, 2013, Investment Bank 1âs Credit Risk Management team agreed to loan an additional
$100 million to Proindicus based on a memorandum written by the defendants ANDREW
PEARSE, SURJAN SINGH and DETELINA SUBEVA, together with others, representing
that Privinvest required additional equipment.

55. On or about June 25, 2013, Investment Bank 1 wired approximately
$100 million less its fees through New York City Bank 1 to a Privinvest account at UAE
Bank 1. Investment Bank 1 marketed and sold portions of the debt to investors, including to

an investor in the United States.

18
ay os
Rah RE

56. Throughout 2013 and 2014, using loan proceeds, Privinvest made
numerous kickback payments to the defendant ANDREW PEARSE. On or about April 15,
2013, PEARSE opened a bank account at a bank in Abu Dhabi, UAE (âUAE Bank 2â), the
identity of which is known to the Grand Jury. After PEARSE opened the account,
Privinvest wired bribe and kickback payments of more than $45 million from UAE Bank 1
accounts to PEARSEâs UAE Bank 2 account. Each payment was denominated in United
States dollars and each was routed and completed through the UAE banksâ correspondent

bank accounts in New York City and passed through the Eastern District of New York, as

57. | The defendant ANDREW PEARSE shared some of the bribes and
kickbacks that he received from the fraudulent loan proceeds with the defendant DETELINA
SUBEVA. On or about and between June 12, 2013 and October 27, 2013, PEARSE
transferred a total of approximately $2.2 million from bank accounts he held at UAE Bank 2
to a bank account SUBEVA held at UAE Bank 2.

D. EMATUM

58. Onor about August 2, 2013, EMATUM entered into an approximately
$785 million contract with Privinvest to purchase vessels, equipment and training to create a
state-owned tuna fishing company. On or about August 30, 2013, Investment Bank 1 agreed
to make up to $850 million in loans guaranteed by Mozambique to EMATUM (the
âEMATUM Loanâ). The EMATUM loan agreement was signed by, among other people,
the defendant SURJAN SINGH on behalf of Investment Bank 1 and the defendant
ANTONIO DO ROSARIO on behalf of EMATUM. The defendant MANUEL CHANG
signed the government guarantee on behalf of Mozambique. On or about September 11,
2013, Investment Bank 1 loaned approximately $500 million to EMATUM to finance the
EMATUM project and, because Investment Bank | refused to loan additional funds, on or
about October 11, 2013, Investment Bank 2 loaned an additional approximately $350 million

to EMATUM.

20
(1) The Fabricated Rationale for the EMATUM Loan

59. In or about May 2013, while Investment Bank 1 was increasing the
Proindicus Loan by approximately $100 million, the defendants ANDREW PEARSE,
DETELINA SUBEVA, JEAN BOUSTANI and ANTONIO DO ROSARIO, together with
others, agreed to a scheme for Mozambique to borrow another $850 million. A significant
portion of the additional funds would be funneled to Privinvest and then misappropriated, at
least in part, to make additional bribe and kickback payments, pay inflated profits and make
loan payments on the Proindicus Loan to prevent discovery of the co-conspiratorsâ fraudulent
scheme.

60. In approximately July 2013, the defendant ANDREW PEARSE
announced to others at Investment Bank 1 that he intended to leave the bank, but he
remained a bank employee on leave until on or about September 13, 2013. Investment Bank
1 also placed the defendant DETELINA SUBEVA on leave on or about July 22, 2013 and
terminated her on or about August 21, 2013.

61. During the summer of 2013, contrary to Investment Bank 1 policies
and procedures, the defendants ANDREW PEARSE and DETELINA SUBEVA used their
personal email accounts to conspire with Mozambican government officials and Privinvest
employees to effectuate a large loan through Investment Bank | for the EMATUM project.
For example, on or about July 4, 2013, PEARSE used his personal email account to email
SUBEVA and the defendant JEAN BOUSTANI certain questions about a proposal PEARSE
had drawn up to create a tuna fishing fleet. In response, on or about July 4, 2013,
BOUSTANI replied that the defendant ANTONIO DO ROSARIO would âgo ahead in all

suggestions needed in order to maximize funding size.â

21
62. By the end of July 2013, the defendants JEAN BOUSTANI,
ANTONIO DO ROSARIO, ANDREW PEARSE, SURJAN SINGH and DETELINA
SUBEVA, together with others, had established the details of the EMATUM project as a
pretext to justify the maximum possible loan amount, rather than to meet legitimate fishing
needs of the EMATUM project. For example, on or about July 21, 2013, BOUSTANI
emailed DO ROSARIO, copying PEARSE and SUBEVA at their personal email accounts:
â(W]e need your Marshall skills to finish by August 19 . . . we will go for 800 million$ so we
keep a cushion for Proindicus interest payment next year.â Later in the email conversation,
BOUSTANI added: âWe can decrease the trawlers to 25 and add two 45 meters OPVs
[military-style trimaran boats] with special systems to âprotectâ the trawlers. Is that better
Andrew?â PEARSE responded on or about July 21, 2013, to BOUSTANI and SUBEVA,
writing, in part: â2 big fisheries makes a lot of sense and ties into Fisheries Master Plan!â

63. Moreover, to avoid detection of the ongoing fraudulent scheme, the
defendants JEAN BOUSTANI, ANTONIO DO ROSARIO, ANDREW PEARSE and
DETELINA SUBEVA also planned to use some of the EMATUM Loan to pay the debt of
the earlier Proindicus project. On or about July 21, 2013, SUBEVA wrote an email to
BOUSTANI, PEARSE and DO ROSARIO, stating: â[W]e should also keep a cushion for
Proindicus of $17mn so that we donât need to go back to MoF [Ministry of Finance] and they
are on our side.â

(2) Conspiracy to Circumvent Investment Bank 1âs Internal Controls and
Win Business for Investment Bank 1 in Connection with the EMATUM

Project, Including Paying Bribes to Mozambican Government Officials

64. The defendants ANDREW PEARSE, SURJAN SINGH and

DETELINA SUBEVA, together with others, conspired to circumvent Investment Bank 1âs
22
internal controls to enrich themselves and win business for Investment Bank 1 in connection
with the EMATUM project. Thus, even though still employed by Investment Bank 1,
PEARSE and SUBEVA sought to conceal their involvement in setting up the EMATUM
project by using personal email accounts and removing all references to themselves from
documents they had prepared. For example:

(a) Onor about July 27, 2013, in response to a request from the
defendant SURJAN SINGH for information on the tuna fishing proposal, the defendant
ANDREW PEARSE used his personal email account to send an email to the defendant
JEAN BOUSTANI, copying the defendant DETELINA SUBEVA on her personal email
account, stating: âWe are going to send both shortly. Plse bro donât just forward but rather
create new email and attach the docs, [Investment Bank 1] is very sensitive to seeing our
names involved.â

(b)  Onor about July 27, 2013, the defendant DETELINA
SUBEVA, using her personal email account, sent an email concerning the tuna fishing
proposal to the defendants JEAN BOUSTANI and ANDREW PEARSE, addressing the
email to PEARSEâs personal email account, stating: âHi Jean â sending you a full info
package to please send to Surjan [SINGH] in a clean email (without my email details).â
Minutes later, SUBEVA sent documents she titled âfeasibility materialsâ and âfinancial
modelâ to BOUSTANI and PEARSE.

(c) Inresponse, on or about July 27, 2013, the defendant ANDREW
PEARSE used his personal email account to instruct the defendant DETELINA SUBEVA on
her personal email account: â[I]f you go into the properties of each doc, it shows you as the

author. You may want to delete [the metadata] and resendâ the documents. Later the same

23
day, using the same personal email accounts, SUBEVA sent an email to PEARSE stating:
âIâm sure Surj [SINGH] can sanitize worst comes to worst and delete the author.â

65. In addition, the defendants JEAN BOUSTANI, ANDREW PEARSE,
SURJAN SINGH and DETELINA SUBEVA created fake competing bids from contractors
for the EMATUM project in anticipation of an inquiry from Investment Bank 1 as to why
Privinvest would be awarded the project. For example, on or about July 31, 2013, PEARSE
sent an email to the BOUSTANI and SUBEVA stating: âGuys, below is the argument that I
think we (or rather the Borrower) should present to [Investment Bank 1] next week when in
Maputo .... The sponsors of the Borrower (ie the various Ministries, but principally SISE)
at the behest of the President went out to 4 shipyards [we need to have names] asking for
proposals to build a fleet... . There was no need legally to have a public tender as
procurement rules donât apply to private companies, but nonetheless they sought a number of
bids. [ JONLY ADM [a Privinvest entity] responded with the full package and offered an
integrated solution with fishing surveillance, command center and boats.â BOUSTANI
replied: âLetâs say they contacted South African yards and Spanish + Portuguese. Without
naming.â

66.  Inan effort to ensure that Investment Bank 1 would arrange the
EMATUM Loan, the defendant SURJAN SINGH included fake bid information in a
memorandum he wrote and submitted to Investment Bank 1 in or about August 2013 to gain
approval for the EMATUM Loan, falsely asserting that the Privinvest proposal was deemed
the most competitive one in comparison to bids from three other international companies.

67. Moreover, in or about early August 2013, the defendant SURJAN

SINGH travelled to Mozambique to lead Investment Bank 1âs due diligence for the
24
EMATUM transaction. In furtherance of the fraudulent scheme, SINGH and the defendants
ANDREW PEARSE and DETELINA SUBEVA provided talking points and suggested
answers to Mozambican government officials for due diligence meetings with Investment
Bank | in an effort to ensure that Investment Bank 1 would arrange the loan.

68. The defendants ANDREW PEARSE and DETELINA SUBEVA, with
the knowledge of the defendant SURJAN SINGH, also continued to hide their own
involvement in the due diligence process. On or about August 4, 2013, SUBEVA sent an
email to the defendant JEAN BOUSTANI, copying PEARSE, stating: âPlse remind [the
defendant ANTONIO DO ROSARIO] not to mention Andrew [PEARSE] and myself to the
[Investment Bank 1] team! They cannot know we are involved in this project!!!!_ If there is
a slip up, say he knows us from the previous deal.â

(3) The EMATUM Loan Agreement and Solicitation of United States
Investors

69. Onor about August 30, 2013, Investment Bank 1 entered into the
$850 million loan agreement with EMATUM. The EMATUM loan agreement was signed
by, among others, the defendant SURJAN SINGH on behalf of Investment Bank 1 and the
defendant ANTONIO DO ROSARIO on behalf of EMATUM. The defendant MANUEL
CHANG signed the government guarantee on behalf of Mozambique.

70. |The EMATUM loan agreement provided that all payments by the
borrower or the lenders would be paid to Investment Bank 1âs bank account at New York
City Bank 1. The agreement also required EMATUM to âapply all amounts borrowed by it
under the [EMATUM loan agreement] towards . . . the purchase of fishing infrastructure,

33

comprising of 27 vessels, an operations centre, and related training.â The loan agreement

25
also prohibited improper payments in connection with the project, including payments that
would violate the FCPA, the UK Bribery Act and the Mozambican Anti-Corruption Law.

71. Onor about September 11, 2013, Investment Bank 1 sent $500 million
in loan proceeds, less its fees, to Privinvest. Investment Bank 1 funded the EMATUM Loan
by selling loan participation notes to investors in the United States and elsewhere. By email
and other electronic means, Investment Bank 1 sent potential investors, including United
States investors, materials that included the EMATUM loan agreement and an offering
circular. Like the loan agreement, the offering circular stated: âThe proceeds from the Loan
will be used by the Borrower towards the financing of the purchase of fishing infrastructure,
comprising of 27 vessels, an operations centre and related training and for the general
corporate purposes of the Borrower.â

72.  Inreliance on the representations in the loan agreement and offering
circular, investors, including investors in the United States, purchased EMATUM loan
participation notes.

73. Despite projections that EMATUM would generate annual fishing
revenues of approximately $224 million by December 2016, it generated virtually no revenues
and, as of approximately late 2017, conducted no fishing operations. EMATUM defaulted
on its financing payment due on or about January 18, 2017.

(4) Bribes and Kickbacks to the Defendant SURJAN SINGH and
Mozambican Government Officials

74. The defendant SURJAN SINGH also received bribe and kickback
payments directly from Privinvest for his role in the fraudulent scheme. Specifically, on or

about October 20, 2013, the defendant ANDREW PEARSE sent an email to the defendant

26
JEAN BOUSTANI with SINGHâs bank account information at UAE Bank 2, referring to
SINGH as âUncle,â and adding, â[i]f we can do something this week he would appreciate it.â
That same day, on or about October 20, 2013, BOUSTANI forwarded the request to the
defendant NAJIB ALLAM, writing, âUncle... Surjan. Total of 4.â

75. Onor about and between October 23, 2013 and February 27, 2014,
Privinvest wired approximately six payments totaling approximately $4.49 million from its
bank account at UAE Bank 1 to the defendant SURJAN SINGHâs UAE Bank 2 account.
Each payment was routed through the UAE banksâ correspondent bank accounts in New

York City. Privinvest made the following bribe and kickback payments to SINGH:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Date Amount Wire Instruction
October 23, 2013 $800,000 | âpymt on consultancy agreementâ
November 27, 2013 $800,000 | âpmt on consultancy agreementâ
December 23, 2013 $800,000 | âpyt on consultancy agreementâ
January 27, 2014 $800,000 | âpyt on consultancy agreementâ
January 28, 2014 $799,960 | âpyt on consultancy agreementâ
February 27, 2014 $500,000 | âpyt on consultancy agreement.â

 

 

 

 

 

76. The defendants JEAN BOUSTANI and NAJIB ALLAM continued to
coordinate the payment of bribes to Mozambican government officials. On or about April 8,
2014, BOUSTANI sent an email to ALLAM, providing an accounting of bribes through the
Proindicus and EMATUM projects and stating that Privinvest had paid â125 [million U.S.
dollars] for all for everything ....â.- BOUSTANI summarized the distribution of the bribes,
including $8.5 million to the defendant TEOFILO NHANGUMELE, $8.5 million to

Mozambican Co-Conspirator 1, $15 million to the defendant ANTONIO DO ROSARIO,
27
$7 million to the defendant MANUEL CHANG and $3 million to Mozambican Co-
Conspirator 3, among others.

77. Inan effort to conceal the unlawful nature of these payments, the
defendants JEAN BOUSTANI, NAJIB ALLAM and ANTONIO DO ROSARIO used third-
party entities and fabricated invoices to distribute money to the Mozambican government
officials. For example, on or about October 17, 2013, BOUSTANI wrote an email to DO
ROSARIO, stating: âI need asap invoices in the name of: Logistics International Abu Dhabi
[a Privinvest-related company]. Invoices for everything my brother. Each one mentioning
the subject (real estate purchase...etc....). Even for Pantero [the defendant MANUEL
CHANG], a small paper say âconsultancy fees.ââ

78. Accordingly, on or about and between October 20, 2013 and December
4, 2013, the defendant JEAN BOUSTANI caused Privinvest to make bribe payments of
approximately $5 million, from Privinvestâs UAE-based bank account, through the Eastern
District of New York, to a bank account in the name of a company controlled by the
defendant MANUEL CHANG.

E. MAM

(1) MAM Loan Agreement

79. Onor about May 1, 2014, MAM and Privinvest executed an
approximately $500 million contract for Privinvest to, among other things, build a shipyard,
provide additional naval vessels and upgrade two existing facilities to service Proindicus and
EMATUM vessels.

80. On or about May 20, 2014, Investment Bank 2 and the Privinvest entity

Palomar, acting through the defendants ANDREW PEARSE and DETELINA SUBEVA,
28
together with others, arranged a syndicated loan of up to $540 million to MAM, guaranteed
by the Republic of Mozambique (the âMAM Loanâ). Investment Bank 2 solicited investors,
using, among other things, the MAM loan agreement and a confidential information
memorandum that summarized its terms. As with the Proindicus and the EMATUM loans,
the loan agreement required that the MAM loan proceeds be used for project purposes and
prohibited illegal and corrupt payments. The defendant ANTONIO DO ROSARIO signed
the loan agreement on behalf of MAM, and the defendant MANUEL CHANG signed the
government guarantee on behalf of Mozambique.

81. |The MAM loan agreement also provided that all payments required
under the agreement were to be made through a bank account in New York City at a New
York City-based financial institution (âNew York City Bank 2â), the identity of which is
known to the Grand Jury.

82. Onor about and between approximately May 23, 2014 and June 11,
2014, MAM borrowed approximately $535 million from Investment Bank 2, guaranteed by
the Republic of Mozambique, which Investment Bank 2 sent directly to Privinvest through
correspondent bank accounts at New York City Bank 2.

(2) MAM Bribe and Kickback Payments

83. An accounting spreadsheet maintained by the defendant NAJIB
ALLAM reflected that Privinvest made bribe and kickback payments to obtain the MAM
contract. Such payments included approximately $13 million to the defendant ANTONIO
DO ROSARIO, approximately $5 million to the defendant MANUEL CHANG,
approximately $918,000 to Mozambican Co-Conspirator 2 and approximately $1.8 million to

Mozambican Co-Conspirator 3.

29
84. Despite projecting approximately $63 million in operating revenues by
the end of its first year of operations, MAM generated virtually no revenues and defaulted on
its loan payment due on or about May 23, 2016.

F, EMATUM Exchange

85.  Inor about 2015, Proindicus, EMATUM, MAM and Mozambique
encountered problems servicing the approximately $2 billion in debt they had amassed in
2013 and 2014, including as a result of the Proindicus, EMATUM and MAM Loans.
Furthermore, at around the same time, Mozambican government officials, including the
defendant ANTONIO DO ROSARIO, received inquiries from the IMF concerning the use of
some of the loan proceeds.

86. To hide from the public and the IMF the near bankruptcy of the project
companies resulting from loan proceeds being diverted as part of the fraudulent scheme,
avoid inquiry from the IMF and conceal discovery of the scheme, several of the co-
conspirators, including the defendants JEAN BOUSTANI, ANDREW PEARSE and
DETELINA SUBEVA, proposed to exchange the EMATUM loan participation notes for
Eurobonds issued directly by the Mozambican government.

87. In furtherance of the fraudulent scheme, in or about and between March
2015 and May 2015, Investment Bank 1 employees, together with the defendants JEAN
BOUSTANI, ANDREW PEARSE and DETELINA SUBEVA, organized meetings with
Mozambican government officials to convince them to restructure the existing loans by
converting them into Eurobonds. The Mozambican government accepted the co-

conspiratorsâ recommendation and hired Investment Bank 1 and Investment Bank 2 to

30
tA
speck

conduct the exchange and Palomar, which employed PEARSE and SUBEVA, as an adviser
for the exchange.

88. Onor about March 9, 2016, Investment Bank 1 and Investment Bank 2
announced the exchange. To convince investors to exchange their loan participation notes
for Eurobonds, the defendants ANDREW PEARSE and DETELINA SUBEVA, together
with bankers at Investment Bank 1 and Investment Bank 2, prepared documents that were
sent to investors, including in the United States. The exchange documents failed to
adequately disclose the existence of the Proindicus and MAM Loans or the maturity dates of
those loans. The documents therefore contained false and misleading information about the
Eurobonds and Mozambiqueâs creditworthiness.

89. By onor about April 6, 2016, based upon the co-conspiratorsâ false and
misleading information, the EMATUM investors consented to the exchange, resulting in the

exchange of the EMATUM LPNs for Eurobonds on that same day.

G. Proindicus, EMATUM and MAM Loan Defaults

 

90. Following the 2016 EMATUM exchange, in or about and between May
2016 and March 2017, Proindicus, EMATUM and MAM each defaulted on their loans, and
Proindicus, EMATUM and MAM proceeded to miss more than $700 million in loan
payments.
H. Summary of Bribe and Kickback Payments
91. In furtherance of the fraudulent scheme, numerous Mozambican
government officials received bribe and kickback payments from Privinvest in connection

with the Mozambican projects. Specifically:

3]
(a) The defendant MANUEL CHANG received at least $5 million
in bribe and kickback payments from Privinvest.

(b) The defendant ANTONIO DO ROSARIO received at least
$12 million in bribe and kickback payments from Privinvest.

â(c) The defendant TEOFILO NHANGUMELE received at least

$8.5 million in bribe and kickback payments from Privinvest.

(d) | Mozambican Co-Conspirator 1 received at least $8.5 million in
bribe and kickback payments from Privinvest.

(ce) Mozambican Co-Conspirator 2 received at least $9.7 million in
bribe and kickback payments from Privinvest.

(f) Mozambican Co-Conspirator 3 received at least $2 million in
bribe and kickback payments from Privinvest.

92. The defendant JEAN BOUSTANI received approximately $15 million
from the proceeds of Privinvestâs fraudulent scheme. In or about and between May 2013
and July 2014, Privinvest paid BOUSTANI these funds in a series of wire transfers, many of
which were paid through a correspondent bank account in New York City and passed
through the Eastern District of New York.
93. Also in furtherance of the scheme, the defendants ANDREW PEARSE,

SURJAN SINGH and DETELINA SUBEVA received bribe and kickback payments in
connection with the Mozambican projects. Specifically:

(a) | The defendant ANDREW PEARSE received over $45 million
in bribe and kickback payments from Privinvest in connection with the Mozambican

maritime projects. Many of these bribe and kickback payments were paid through a

32
correspondent bank account in New York City and passed through the Eastern District of
New York.

(b) The defendant SURJAN SINGH received bribe and kickback
payments totaling approximately $4.5 million from Privinvest. At least one bribe and
kickback payment from Privinvest was paid through a correspondent account in New York
City and passed through the Eastern District of New York.

(c) The defendant DETELINA SUBEVA received bribe and
kickback payments of at least $2.2 million from the defendant ANDREW PEARSE.

to the co-conspirators, including Mozambican government officials.

the documents.

(g) On or about August 4, 2013, SUBEVA, using her personal
email account, sent an email to PEARSE at his personal email account that stated: â[A]s
promised, below is suggested âscriptâ for the DD [due diligence] meeting with the lady from
Ministry of Fisheries. These questions have been answered very well before so should
ensure a very productive low risk meeting. It overlaps well with the [Investment Bank 1]
list.â

ROSARIO providing information for a due diligence meeting with Investment Bank 1

scheduled for the next day.

account to send PEARSE at his personal email account another due diligence script, which,
she explained, â[M]ay be helpful to go to S as it has gone to [DO ROSARIO] so he should be
prepared to handle the DD [due diligence] questions on competition, export plans and why
ADM [Abu Dhabi MAR] that are part of the list.â

member of the Investment Bank 1 deal team asking him to provide verification of

responded: âI am trying to get hold of uncle [SINGH]. Donât have a call plse until I have
spoken with him and conformed wot the [expletive] this is about.â

(n)  Onor about the same day, May 15, 2014, after speaking with

SINGH, PEARSE wrote an email to DO ROSARIO and BOUSTANI, stating: âUncle is

him to tell [an Investment Bank 1 employee who made the initial request], that she is fired if
she doesnât behave in the future!â

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Thursday, March 7, 2019

Mozambiqueâs Former Finance Minister Indicted Alongside Other Former Mozambican Officials,
Business Executives, and Investment Bankers in Alleged $2 Billion Fraud and Money Laundering
Scheme that Victimized U.S. Investors

More Than $200 Million in Alleged Bribes and Kickbacks Paid to Mozambican Government Officials and
Investment Bankers in Corrupt Maritime Loans for Mozambique

A four-count indictment was returned on Dec. 19, 2018, by a grand jury in the Eastern District of New York, charging two executives of a
shipbuilding company, three former senior Mozambican government officials, and three former London-based investment bankers for their roles
in a $2 billion fraud and money laundering scheme that victimized investors from the United States and elsewhere.

Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Richard P. Donoghue of the Eastern
District of New York, and Assistant Director in Charge William F. Sweeney Jr. of the FBIâs New York Field Office made the announcement.

âThe indictment unsealed today alleges a brazen international criminal scheme in which corrupt Mozambique government officials, corporate
executives, and investment bankers stole approximately $200 million in loan proceeds that were meant to benefit the people of Mozambique,â
said Assistant Attorney General Benczkowski. âThe Department of Justice and our law enforcement partners are dedicated to using all tools at
our disposal to prosecute those who engage in money laundering, financial fraud and corruption at the expense of U.S. investors, wherever
those individuals may be located.â

âAs charged in the indictment, the defendants orchestrated an immense fraud and bribery scheme that took advantage of the U.S. financial
system, defrauded its investors and adversely impacted the economy of Mozambique, in order to line their own pockets with hundreds of
millions of dollars,â said U.S. Attorney Donoghue. âThis indictment underscores the Department of Justiceâs continuing efforts to end such
fraudulent and corrupt practices and to hold those responsible to account for their crimes.â

âToday's indictment proves that no matter who you are, or what position of power you're in, you're not immune from prosecution,â said FBI
Assistant Director in Charge Sweeney. âThe FBI will continue to use all resources at our disposal to uncover crimes of this nature and expose
them for what they really are.â

Jean Boustani, 40, a citizen of Lebanon who worked for the Privinvest Group, a United Arab Emirates-based shipbuilding company, was arrested
at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York on Jan. 2, 2019 and arraigned later that day in the Eastern District of New York on charges that he
conspired with others to commit one count of wire fraud, one count of securities fraud, and one count of money laundering in connection with
$200 million in bribe and kickback payments he helped organize relating to three loans totaling more than $2 billion that were marketed and
sold to U.S. victim investors. Boustani has pleaded not guilty to the charges; a trial date has not yet been set. Alongside Boustani, Privinvestâs
chief financial officer Najib Allam, 58, a citizen of Lebanon, was charged with the same counts. Allam is alleged to have worked with Boustani to
make the bribe and kickback payments. Allam is not currently in U.S. custody.

Manuel Chang, 63, the former Mozambican minister of finance who is a citizen and resident of Mozambique, was charged with the same counts
as Boustani, namely one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, and one count of
conspiracy to commit money laundering. Chang was arrested at the request of the United States by South African authorities on Dec. 29,
2018. The United States is seeking Changâs extradition.

Antonio do Rosario, 44, a citizen and resident of Mozambique, was an official with Mozambiqueâs State Information and Security Service and a
director and officer of each of the three Mozambican entities that obtained the maritime loans. Do Rosario was charged with one count of
conspiracy to commit wire fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering
in connection with his receipt of bribe payments relating to the loans. Do Rosario is not currently in U.S. custody.

Teofilo Nhangumele, 50, a citizen and resident of Mozambique, acted on behalf of the Office of the President of Mozambique. Nhangumele was
charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering in connection with his
negotiation and receipt of bribe payments relating to the loans. Nhangumele is not currently in U.S. custody.

The three investment bankers, Andrew Pearse, 49; Surjan Singh, 44; and Detelina Subeva, 37, each of whom is a resident of the United
Kingdom, were also charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, and one
count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. In addition, each banker was charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery
and internal controls provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) in connection with their roles in facilitating bribe payments to
government officials in Mozambique and for circumventing the internal accounting controls of a foreign investment bank that arranged two of
the loans. At the time, Pearse and Singh were managing directors of the investment bank, and Subeva was a vice president.

Pearse, Singh and Subeva were arrested on Jan. 3, in the United Kingdom, all pursuant to provisional arrest warrants issued at the request of
the United States. The United States is seeking their extradition.

The indictment alleges that between approximately 2013 and 2016, the co-conspirators organized for more than $2 billion in three loans to be
arranged by Investment Bank and another foreign bank. The loans were made to companies owned and controlled by the Mozambican
government: Proindicus S.A., Empresa Mocambicana de Atum, S.A. (EMATUM) and Mozambique Asset Management (MAM). The money was
purportedly to be used to fund three maritime projects for which the shipbuilder, Privinvest, would provide the equipment and services.
Proindicus was to perform coastal surveillance, EMATUM was to engage in tuna fishing, and MAM was to build and maintain shipyards. Chang,
in his capacity as minister of finance, signed guarantees on behalf of Mozambique for all three fraudulent loans. Singh signed the agreements
on behalf of the investment bank for the two loans on which the bank acted as primary arranger. The investment bank subsequently paid the
loans directly to Privinvest.

As further alleged in the indictment, the co-conspirators facilitated Privinvestâs criminal diversion of more than $200 million in loan proceeds,
including more than $150 million in bribe payments to Chang and other Mozambican government officials that Privinvest paid to ensure that
Mozambique would enter into the loan arrangements. In addition to the bribe payments, the alleged fraud also included approximately $50
million in kickback payments to Pearse, Singh, and Subeva, who assisted the conspirators to obtain financing for the loans through their
investment bank and a second foreign investment bank. Pearse, Singh, and Subeva, along with the other members of the conspiracy, allegedly
subsequently sold the loans to investors worldwide, including in the United States. Moreover, the participants in the scheme allegedly
conspired to defraud these investors by misrepresenting how the loan proceeds would be used, the amount and maturity dates of other loans
and debt Mozambique was obligated to pay, and the ability of Mozambique or its state-owned entities to repay the loans.

Mozambique and its state-owned entities have thus far allegedly failed to make more than $700 million of repayments that have become due
on the loans.

The charges in the indictment are merely allegations, and the defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt
in a court of law.

The investigation is being conducted by the FBIâs New York Field Office. The governmentâs case is being prosecuted by the Criminal Divisionâs
Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section (MLARS) and Fraud Section, and the Business and Securities Fraud Section of the U.S. Attorney's
Office for the Eastern District of New York. MLARS Trial Attorneys Sean W. O'Donnell and Margaret A. Moeser, Fraud Section Trial Attorney
David M. Fuhr, and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Matthew S. Amatruda and Mark E. Bini of the Eastern District of New York are prosecuting the case.

The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs provided critical assistance in this case. The Department appreciates the significant
cooperation and assistance provided by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Department also appreciates the assistance provided by
law enforcement authorities in the United Kingdom and in South Africa.

MLARS'âs Bank Integrity Unit investigates and prosecutes banks and other financial institutions, including their officers, managers, and
employees, whose actions threaten the integrity of the individual institution or the wider financial system.

The Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice
Departmentâs FCPA enforcement efforts can be found at www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.

t
ANTHONY MACE, â
Defendant. '

PLEA AGREEMENT

The United States of America, by and through Abe Martinez, Acting United States
Attorney, and Suzanne Elmilady, Assistant United States Attorney, and Sandra Moser, Acting
Chief of the Fraud Section of the Criminal Division of the United States Department of Justice
(âFraud Sectionâ) and Dennis R. Kihm, Trial Attorney, and the defendant, Anthony Mace
(âDefendantâ), and Defendantâs counsel, pursuant to Rule 11(c)(1)(A) and 11(c)(1)(B) of the
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, state that they have entered into an agreement, the terms and
conditions of which are as follows:

Defendantâs Agreement

1. Defendant agrees to plead guilty to Count One of the Information. Count One
charges Defendant with conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, Title 15, United
States Code, Sections 78dd-2 and 78dd-3 (âFCPAâ), in violation of Title 18, United States Code,
Section 371. Defendant, by entering this plea, agrees that he is waiving any right to have the facts
that the law makes essential to the punishment either charged in the Information, or proved to a
jury beyond a reasonable doubt.

Punishment Range
2. The statutory maximum penalty for a violation of Title 18, United States Code,

Section 371, is imprisonment of not more than five years and a fine of not more than $250,000 or
ann aot

twice the gross gain or loss. Additionally, Defendant may receive a term of supervised release
after imprisonment of up to three years. See Title 18, United States Code, Sections 3571(b)(3),
3571(d), and 3583(b)(2). Defendant acknowledges and understands that if he should violate the
conditions of any period of supervised release which may be imposed as part of his sentence, then
Defendant may be imprisoned for the entire term of supervised release, without credit for time
already served on the term of supervised release prior to such violation. See Title 18, United
States Code, Section 3583(e)(3). Defendant understands that he cannot have the imposition or
execution of the sentence suspended, nor is he eligible for parole.
Mandatory Special Assessment

3. Pursuant to Title 18, United States Code, section 3013(a)(2)(A), immediately after
sentencing, Defendant will pay to the Clerk of the United States District Court a special assessment
in the amount of one hundred dollars ($100.00) per count of conviction. The payment will be by
cashierâs check or money order, payable to the Clerk of the United States District Court, c/o
District Clerkâs Office, P.O. Box 61010, Houston, Texas 77208, Attention: Finance.

Immigration Consequences

4. Defendant recognizes that pleading guilty may have consequences with respect to
his immigration status if he is not a citizen of the United States. Defendant understands that if he
is not a citizen of the United States, by pleading guilty he may be removed from the United States,
denied citizenship, and denied admission to the United States in the future. Defendantâs attorney
has advised Defendant of the potential immigration consequences resulting from Defendantâs plea
of guilty.

Waiver of Appeal and Collateral Review
5. Defendant is aware that Title 28, United States Code, section 1291, and Title 18,

United States Code, section 3742, afford a defendant the right to appeal the conviction and

2
sentence imposed. Defendant is also aware that Title 28, United States Code, section 2255, affords
the right to contest or âcollaterally attackâ a conviction or sentence after the judgment of conviction
and sentence has become final. Defendant knowingly and voluntarily waives the right to appeal or
âcollaterally attackâ the conviction and sentence, except that Defendant does not waive the right
to raise a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal, if otherwise permitted, or on
collateral review in a motion under Title 28, United States Code, section 2255. In the event
Defendant files a notice of appeal following the imposition of the sentence or later collaterally
attacks his conviction or sentence, the United States will assert its rights under this agreement and
seek specific performance of these waivers.

| 6. Defendant waives all defenses based on venue, speedy trial under the Constitution
and Speedy Trial Act, and the statute of limitations, in the event that (a) Defendantâs conviction is
later vacated for any reason, (b) Defendant violates any provision of this Agreement, or
(c) Defendantâs plea is later withdrawn.

7. In agreeing to these waivers, Defendant is aware that a sentence has not yet been
determined by the Court. Defendant is also aware that any estimate of the possible sentencing
range under the sentencing guidelines that he may have received from his counsel, the United
States or the Probation Office, is a prediction and not a promise, did not induce his guilty plea, and
is not binding on the United States, the Probation Office or the Court. The United States does not
make any promise or representation concerning what sentence the defendant will receive.
Defendant further understands and agrees that the United States Sentencing Guidelines are
âeffectively advisoryâ to the Court. See United States y Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005).
Accordingly, Defendant understands that, although the Court must consult the Sentencing

Guidelines and must take them into account when sentencing Defendant, the Court is not bound
to follow the Sentencing Guidelines nor sentence Defendant within the calculated guideline

range.

8. Defendant understands and agrees that each and all waivers contained in the
Agreement are made in exchange for the concessions made by the United States in this plea
agreement.

The United Statesâ Agreements

9. The United States agrees to each of the following:

@) At the time of sentencing, the United States agrees not to oppose

Defendantâs anticipated request to the Court and the United States Probation Office

that he receive a two (2) level downward adjustment pursuant to section 3E1.1(a)

of the United States Sentencing Guidelines, should Defendant accept responsibility

as contemplated by the Sentencing Guidelines; and

(b) If Defendant qualifies for an adjustment under section 3E1.1(a) of

the United States Sentencing Guidelines, the United States agrees not to oppose

Defendantâs request for an additional one-level departure based on the timeliness

of the plea or the expeditious manner in which Defendant provided complete

information regarding his role in the offense (if Defendantâs offense level is 16 or

greater).
Agreement Binding - Southern District of Texas and Fraud Section Only

10. The United States Attorneyâs Office for the Southern District of Texas and the
Fraud Section agree that they will not further criminally prosecute Defendant for offenses arising
from conduct charged in the Information. This plea agreement binds only the United States
Attorney for the Southern District of Texas, the Fraud Section, and the Defendant. It does not bind

any other United States Attorneyâs Office or any other unit of the Department of Justice.

4
The United States Attorneyâs Office for the Southern District of Texas and the Fraud Section will
bring this plea agreement and the full extent of Defendantâs cooperation to the attention of other
prosecuting offices, including prosecution offices in foreign countries, if requested.
United Statesâ Non-Waiver of Appeal

ll. The United States reserves the right to carry out its responsibilities under guidelines

sentencing. Specifically, the United States reserves the right:
@) to bring its version of the facts of this case, including its evidence
file and any investigative files, to the attention of the Probation Office in connection

with that officeâs preparation of a presentence report;

(b) to set forth or dispute sentencing factors or facts material to
sentencing;
Â© to seek resolution of such factors or facts in conference with

Defendantâs counsel and the Probation Office;
@ to file a pleading relating to these issues, in accordance with section
6A1.2 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines and Title 18, United States Code,
section 3553(a); and
Â© to appeal the sentence imposed or the manner in which it was
determined.
Sentence Determination
12. Defendant is aware that the sentence will be imposed after consideration of the
United States Sentencing Guidelines and Policy Statements, which are only advisory, as well as
the provisions of Title 18, United States Code, Section 3553(a). Defendant nonetheless
acknowledges and agrees that the Court has authority to impose any sentence up to and including
the statutory maximum set for the offense(s) to which Defendant pleads guilty, and that the

5
sentence to be imposed is within the sole discretion of the sentencing judge after the Court has
consulted the applicable Sentencing Guidelines. Defendant understands and agrees that the partiesâ
positions regarding the application of the Sentencing Guidelines do not bind the Court and that the
sentence imposed is within the discretion of the sentencing judge. If the Court should impose any
sentence up to the maximum established by statute, or should the Court order any or all of the
sentences imposed to run consecutively, Defendant cannot, for that reason alone, withdraw a guilty
plea, and will remain bound to fulfill all of the obligations under this plea agreement.
Rights at Trial

13. Defendant understands that by entering into this agreement, he surrenders certain
rights as provided in this plea agreement. Defendant understands that the rights of a defendant
include the following:

@) If Defendant persisted in a plea of not guilty to the charges,

defendant would have the right to a speedy jury trial with the assistance of counsel.

The trial may be conducted by a judge sitting without a jury if Defendant, the

United States, and the court all agree.

(b) At a trial, the United States would be required to present witnesses

and other evidence against Defendant. Defendant would have the opportunity to

confront those witnesses and his attorney would be allowed to cross-examine them.

In turn, Defendant could, but would not be required to, present witnesses and other

evidence on his own behalf. If the witnesses for Defendant would not appear

voluntarily, he could require their attendance through the subpoena power of the

court; and
Â© At a trial, Defendant could rely on a privilege against self-
incrimination and decline to testify, and no inference of guilt could be drawn from

such refusal to testify. However, if Defendant desired to do so, he could testify on

his own behalf.

Factual Basis for Guilty Plea

14. Defendant is pleading guilty because he is in fact guilty of the charge contained in
Count One of the Information. If this case were to proceed to trial, the United States could prove
each element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. The following facts, among others would
be offered to establish Defendantâs guilt:

From in or around April 2008 until in or around December 2011, Defendant was CEO of
âOil Services Company.â âOil Services Company,â an entity whose identity is known to
Defendant, was a publicly-traded company in the Netherlands, headquartered in Amsterdam, with
other principal offices in Monaco, Marly, Switzerland and Houston, Texas, and subsidiaries in
Houston, Texas. Oil Services Company specialized in designing, constructing, and providing
offshore oil and gas drilling equipment, including Floating Production Storage and Offloading
vessels (ââFPSOâs), to, among others, state-owned and state-controlled oil and gas companies,
including PetrÃ©leo Brasileiro S.A. (âPetrobrasâ), the state-owned and state-controlled oil company
for Brazil; PetrolÃ©os de Guinea Ecuatorial (âGEPetrolâ), the state-owned and state- controlled oil
company for Equatorial Guinea; and Sociedade Nacional de Combustiveis de Angola, E.P.
(âSonangolâ), the state-owned and state-controlled oil company for Angola.

While Defendant was CEO, he was also a Board Member for one of Oil Services
Companyâs wholly-owned Houston, Texas-based subsidiaries, âU.S. Subsidiary 1.â U/S.
Subsidiary 1 was responsible for certain engineering projects, but also supported Oil Services
Companyâs worldwide operations, including its marketing and sales operations.

7
âExecutive 1â was a high-level executive at Oil Services Company from 2004 until 2008.

âExecutive 3â was a high-level executive in Oil Services Companyâs Marketing and
Sales Department from 2000 until 2008.

âIntermediary 1â was a Brazil-based oil and gas services intermediary that operated as Oil
Services Companyâs sales agent in Brazil from 1996 until 2012.

Beginning by at least in or around 1996, before Defendant became CEO, Oil Services
Company, U.S. Subsidiary, certain principals and employees of Oil Services Company, including
Executive 1 and Executive 3, certain of Oil Services Companyâs sales agents, including
Intermediary 1âs owner, and others entered into an agreement to pay bribes to foreign officials,
including officials at Petrobras, Sonangol and, GEPetrol, in order to obtain or retain business for
Oil Services Company, in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.

In April 2008, Defendant became CEO of Oil Services Company. As CEO, Defendant held
oversight authority over the entire company, including its Marketing and Sales Department.
Further, Defendant was required to personally approve payments exceeding a certain dollar
amount, including those made to outside sales agents.

At the time Defendant became CEO, he was aware that paying bribes to foreign officials
was a crime under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and that Oil Services Company was operating
in countries with a high risk of corruption. Despite this, Defendant joined the conspiracy by
continuing to make payments that furthered the bribery scheme and deliberately avoiding learning
that certain payments, including payments Defendant authorized and approved, were in fact bribes

paid to foreign officials. Defendantâs deliberate avoidance was solely and entirely due to his own

actions and decisions.

Beginning by in or around the fall of 2008, Defendant was in possession of a spreadsheet
reflecting over $16 million in payments to five individuals to be paid through a company controlled
by Executive 3. Defendant was aware of a high risk that those individuals were either Equatorial
Guinean officials or persons receiving money on behalf or at the direction of such officials.

Defendant nevertheless authorized the following transfers from a bank account in the United

Kingdom under Oil Services Companyâs control, through a bank account in the United States, to

a Switzerland-based bank account controlled by Executive 3:

October 29, 2009 $3,637,150
il 29, 2010 $645,150

ber 21, 2010 $645,150
March 30, 2011 $645,150
December 2, 2011 $12,489,400

 

Defendant updated the spreadsheet to reflect that the payments were made.

Beginning in or around November 2008, Defendant continued a practice that was instituted
before he became CEO, which was to authorize Oil Services Companyâs finance department to
issue split payments to Intermediary 1. Specifically, Defendant authorized a portion of
Intermediary 1Â°s commission paid to an account in Brazil, and another portion of Intermediary 1âs

commission paid to accounts in Switzerland, which were held in the name of shell companies.
Defendant deliberately avoided learning the ultimate recipients of those payments, which were, in

fact, employees of Petrobras.

November 24, 2008 $1,756,65 $3,513,3

12, 2009 $597,5 $1,195,
A 4, 2010 $ $1,656,391
December 15, 2011 $33,022.72 $66,045.45
December 27, 2011 $ $859,875.6

to order Defendant to pay a fine that is sufficient to reimburse the government for the costs of any

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Friday, September 28, 2018

Oil Services CEO and Executive Sentenced to Prison for Roles in Foreign Bribery Scheme

A former CEO and former executive of an oil services company were sentenced to prison today for their involvement in an international bribery
conspiracy.

Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Ryan K. Patrick of the Southern
District of Texas and Special Agent in Charge Mark Dawson of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcementâs Homeland Security Investigationsâ
(HSI) Houston Field Office made the announcement.

Anthony âTonyâ Mace, 66, of the United Kingdom, the former CEO of SBM Offshore, N.V. (SBM), a Dutch oil services company, and a former
Board Member of SBMâs U.S.-based subsidiary, SBM Offshore USA Inc. (SBM USA), was sentenced to serve 36 months in prison and a fine of
$150,000. Robert Zubiate, 66, of Agoura Hills, California, a former sales and marketing executive at SBM USA, was sentenced to serve 30
months in prison and a fine of $50,000.

âAnthony Mace and Robert Zubiate played key roles in a massive bribery scheme that involved the payment of millions of dollars to public
officials in exchange for lucrative oil-services contracts,â said Assistant Attorney General Benczkowski. âTheir actions rewarded corrupt officialsâ
greed and tilted the playing field against honest, law-abiding companies. Today they paid a heavy price for their crimes. Their sentences
should serve as a warning to corporate executives everywhere: if you pay bribes to advance your business interests, we will catch you and we
will prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law.â

âPursuing corrupt companies and individuals who misuse our financial system to commit FCPA violations represents our commitment to keeping
the integrity of American democracy in place both here and abroad,â said U.S. Attorney Patrick. âWe will continue to prosecute such cases
involving wrongdoing for corporate crimes and greed.â

âThis case is a prime example of Homeland Security Investigationsâ enduring commitment to work closely with our foreign law enforcement
partners to track down those who seek to gain an unfair competitive advantage in the international marketplace,â said HSI Special Agent in
Charge Dawson. âBy working together to hold these individuals accountable for their actions, we have taken a significant step to level the
playing field for companies and consumers.â

In November 2017, Mace and Zubiate each pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) in
connection with a scheme to bribe foreign government officials in Brazil, Angola and Equatorial Guinea.

According to admissions made in connection with his plea agreement, Mace acknowledged that prior to his becoming CEO, other employees of
SBM entered into an agreement to pay bribes to foreign officials including at Brazilâs state-controlled oil company, PetrdÃ©leo Brasileiro S.A.
(Petrobras); Angolaâs state-owned oil company, Sociedade Nacional de Combustiveis de Angola, E.P. (Sonangol); and Equatorial Guinea's state-
owned oil company, PetrolÃ©os de Guinea Ecuatorial (GEPetrol). Mace admitted that he joined the conspiracy by authorizing payments in
furtherance of the bribery scheme and deliberately avoided learning that those payments were bribes.

In particular, Mace maintained a spreadsheet reflecting payments to five individuals. Mace acknowledged that even though he was aware there
was a high risk those individuals were Equatorial Guinean officials, he nevertheless authorized SBM to make over $16 million in payments to
those individuals. Mace further continued a practice that was instituted before he became CEO by splitting payments to SBMâs Brazilian
intermediary, that is, paying a portion of the intermediaryâs commission to an account in Brazil and another portion of the agentâs commission
to accounts in Switzerland held in the name of shell companies. Mace deliberately avoided learning that the ultimate recipients of the
payments that he authorized to the shell companies were Petrobras officials, he admitted.

According to admissions made in connection with Zubiateâs plea, from between 1996 and 2012, Zubiate and others used a third-party sales
agent to pay bribes to foreign officials at Petrobras in exchange for those officialsâ assisting SBM and SBM USA with winning lucrative offshore
oil projects from Petrobras. Zubiate also admitted engaging in a kickback scheme with the bribe-paying sales agent for SBM and its SBM USA.

In November 2017, SBM entered int 238 million dollar, three- r deferr: c tion agreement with the United States over its role in the
conspiracy, while its subsidiary, SBM USA, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA.

HSI and IRS Criminal Investigation investigated the case. Trial Attorney Dennis R. Kihm of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant
U.S. Attorney Suzanne Elmilady of the Southern District of Texas are prosecuting the case. The Criminal Division's Office of International Affairs
also provided substantial assistance in this matter.

The Department of Justice is grateful to Brazilâs MinistÃ©rio Publico Federal, the Netherlands Public Prosecution Service and Switzerlandâs Office
of the Attorney General and Federal Office of Justice for providing substantial assistance in gathering evidence during this investigation.

The Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice Departmentâs FCPA
enforcement efforts can be found at www. justice. gov/criminal-fr foreign-corrupt-practi

Over the course of the transactions, the co-conspirators, among other things, conspired to
defraud investors and potential investors in the Proindicus, EMATUM and MAM financings
through numerous material misrepresentations and omissions relating to, among other things:
(i) the use of loan proceeds, (ii) bribe and kickback payments to Mozambican government
officials and bankers, (iii) the amount and maturity dates of debt owed by Mozambique, and
(iv) Mozambiqueâs ability and intention to pay back the investors.

25. Each of the companies entered into contracts with Privinvest to provide
equipment and services to complete the maritime projects. The loan proceeds were
supposed to be used exclusively for the maritime projects, and nearly all of the borrowed
money was paid directly to Privinvest, the sole contractor for the projects, to benefit
Mozambique and its people. In reality, the defendants JEAN BOUSTANI, NAJIB
ALLAM, MANUEL CHANG, ANTONIO DO ROSARIO, TEOFILO NHANGUMELE,
ANDREW PEARSE, SURJAN SINGH and DETELINA SUBEVA, together with others,
created the maritime projects as fronts to raise money to enrich themselves and intentionally
diverted portions of the loan proceeds to pay at least $200 million in bribes and kickbacks to

themselves, Mozambican government officials and others.
26. The co-conspirators applied only a portion of the loan proceeds towards
the maritime projects. In furtherance of the scheme, Privinvest charged inflated prices for
the equipment and services it provided, which were then used, at least in part, to pay bribes
and kickbacks. After conducting little or no business activity, Proindicus, EMATUM and
MAM each defaulted on their loans.

B. Relevant Internal Accounting Controls of Investment Bank 1

27. The FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Sections 78m(b)(2)(B),
78m(b)(4), 78(b)(5) and 78ff(a) required issuers to maintain a system of sufficient internal
accounting controls and made it illegal to knowingly and willfully circumvent such controls.

28. Investment Bank 1 had internal accounting controls (âinternal
controlsâ) that addressed, among other things, the prevention of bribery of and by Investment
Bank 1 employees; the prevention of money laundering and other financial crimes; conflicts
of interests; outside employment; and the use of intermediaries in financial transactions.
Investment Bank 1âs compliance department exercised primary responsibility for overseeing
and enforcing Investment Bank 1âs internal controls.

29. Within Investment Bank 1, the group of investment bankers assigned to
a specific transaction was called the âdeal team.â The defendants ANDREW PEARSE,
SURJAN SINGH and DETELINA SUBEVA were part of the deal team on the Proindicus
project and SINGH was a member of the deal team on the EMATUM project. They
received regular training on Investment Bank 1âs internal controls and were also aware of

. those internal controls through their involvement in numerous transactions.

C. The Proindicus Project

30. Onor about January 18, 2013, Privinvest entered into a $366 million
contract with Proindicus to supply materials and training to protect Mozambiqueâs territorial
waters. On or about February 28, 2013, pursuant to a written loan agreement, Investment
Bank 1 agreed to arrange a $372 million syndicated loan to Proindicus, guaranteed by the
Republic of Mozambique (the âProindicus Loanâ). The defendant SURJAN SINGH signed
the loan agreement on behalf of Investment Bank 1, the defendant ANTONIO DO
ROSARIO co-signed on behalf of Proindicus and the defendant MANUEL CHANG signed
the government guarantee for the loan on behalf of Mozambique. Between approximately
June and August 2013, Investment Bank | increased the Proindicus Loan by approximately
$132 million. On or about November 15, 2013, Investment Bank 2 further increased the
Proindicus Loan by $118 million, bringing the total loaned amount to $622 million.
Proindicus never conducted significant operations or generated significant revenue and
defaulted on its loan payment due on or about March 21, 2017.

(1) Bribery of Mozambican Government Officials to Gain Approval for the
Proindicus Project

31. Beginning in or about 2011, the defendant JEAN BOUSTANI, through
discussions with the defendant TEOFILO NHANGUMELE arranged by Privinvest Co-
Conspirator 1, attempted to persuade Mozambican government officials to establish a coastal
monitoring system through a contract with Privinvest. Almost immediately, BOUSTANI
and NHANGUMELE negotiated the first round of bribe and kickback payments that

Privinvest would have to make for the benefit of Mozambican government officials for the
project to be approved. For example, in furtherance of the scheme, BOUSTANI,
NHANGUMELE and other co-conspirators had the following discussions:

(a) | Onor about November 11, 2011, NHANGUMELE wrote to
BOUSTANI by email, stating: âTo secure that the project is granted a go-ahead by the HoS
[Head of State], a payment has to be agreed before we get there, so that we know and agree,
well in advance, what ought to be paid and when. Whatever advance payments to be paid
before the project, they can be built in the project, and recovered.â

(b) Later on or about the same day, November 11, 2011,
BOUSTANI wrote to NHANGUMELE by email, stating: âA very important issue which
needs to be clear: we had various negative experiences in Africa. Especially related to the
âsuccess feesâ payments. Therefore, we have a strict policy in the Group consisting of not
disbursing any âsuccess feeâ before the signature of the Project Contract.â

(c) | Onor about November 14, 2011, NHANGUMELE responded
by email to BOUSTANI, stating: âFabulous, I agree with you in principle. Let us agree and
look at project in two distinct moments. One moment is to massage the system and get the
political will to go ahead with the project. The second moment is the project
implementation/execution. I agree with you that any monies can only be paid after the
project signing. This has to be treated separately from the project implementation .. .
Because for the project implementation there will be other players whose interest will have to
be looked after e.g. ministry of defense, ministry of interior, air force, etc. . . . in democratic
governments like ours people come and go, and everyone involved will want to have his/her

share of the deal while in office, because once out of the office it will be difficult. So, it is
important that the contract signing success fee be agreed and paid in once-off, upon the
signing of the contract.â
32. Soon thereafter, during an email exchange on or about December 28,

2011, the defendants JEAN BOUSTANI and TEOFILO NHANGUMELE agreed to $50
million in bribe and kickback payments to Mozambican government officials and $12
million in kickbacks for Privinvest co-conspirators. For example:

(a) On or about December 28, 2011, in response to an email from
BOUSTANI requesting a bribe and kickback figure, NHANGUMELE wrote: âFine brother.
I have consulted and please put 50 million chickens. Whatever numbers you have on your
poultry I will add 50 million of my breed.â

(b) Onor about the same day, BOUSTANI forwarded this email to
Privinvest personnel, stating, âSOM for them and 12M for [Privinvest Co-Conspirator 1]
(5%) ==> total of 62M on top.â

33. After more than a year of negotiations, on or about January 18, 2013,

Privinvest and Proindicus signed a $366 million contract for Privinvest to provide a coastal
monitoring system to Mozambique. Five days later, on or about January 23, 2013, the
defendant JEAN BOUSTANI instructed a bank in the UAE to make payments to the
defendant TEOFILO NHANGUMELE and Mozambican Co-Conspirator 1. The
instructions ordered the bank, in relevant part: âUpon receipt by Privinvest Shipbuilding of a
minimum amount of US$ 317,000,000 . . . to pay immediately: a. Teofilo Nhangumele the
sum of US$ 5,100,000 . . . and b. [Mozambican Co-Conspirator 1] the sum of
US$ 5,100,000.â The instructions also ordered the bank to pay NHANGUMELE and

Mozambican Co-Conspirator 1 an additional approximately $3.4 million each at later dates.

10
(2) Bribery to Gain Mozambiqueâs Government Guarantee for the
Proindicus Financing

34. | At the same time as the defendants JEAN BOUSTANI and TEOFILO
NHANGUMELE were negotiating bribe payments to cause Mozambican government
officials to approve the Proindicus project, BOUSTANI recruited Investment Bank 1 to
arrange financing for the project. During negotiations, bankers at Investment Bank 1 made
clear that Investment Bank 1 would only arrange a loan that was at or near market interest
rates, with debt that was either directly issued by the Government of Mozambique or
guaranteed by the government.

35. To further negotiations on the Proindicus project, on or about
September 13, 2012, the defendant ANDREW PEARSE traveled to the UAE to meet with
the defendants JEAN BOUSTANI and TEOFILO NHANGUMELE and a close relative of a
senior Mozambican government official, among others.

36. Tohelp obtain Mozambiqueâs agreement to Investment Bank 1âs terms,
including that any loan be at or near market rates and guaranteed by the Mozambican
government, the defendants JEAN BOUSTANI and TEOFILO NHANGUMELE enlisted the
defendant MANUEL CHANG, Mozambiqueâs Minister of Finance. On or about December
22, 2012, CHANG wrote a letter to Privinvest Co-Conspirator 2, which was forwarded to an
employee of Investment Bank 1 (âInvestment Bank 1 Employee 1â), an individual whose
identity is known to the Grand Jury, explaining that âthe financing of this project is still
constrained by the IMF imposed limitation on the Government for Mozambique to accept
commercial credit for commercial projects. Therefore, we have devised an alternative

solution whereby an SPV [Special Purpose Vehicle] . . . will be formed.â

11
37. | Onor about December 26, 2012, the defendant JEAN BOUSTANI sent
an email to the defendant TEOFILO NHANGUMELE in preparation for a meeting in
Mozambique between employees of Investment Bank 1, Privinvest and Proindicus to
negotiate the terms of the transaction. In the email, BOUSTANI emphasized: âBut the only
imperative matter for [Investment Bank 1] bro is [the defendant MANUEL CHANGâs]
signature of the guarantee for the loan.â

38. | Onor about February 28, 2013, the defendant MANUEL CHANG
signed the guarantee for the Proindicus Loan. In or about and between October 2013 and
December 2013, the defendants JEAN BOUSTANI and NAJIB ALLAM, along with others,
paid at least $5 million in bribe and kickback payments for the benefit of CHANG from a
bank account in the UAE, through the United States, to a bank account in Spain.

(3) Conspiracy to Circumvent Investment Bank 1âs Internal Controls and
Win Business for Investment Bank | in Connection with the Proindicus

Project, Including Paying Bribes to Mozambican Government Officials

39. | While negotiations over the Proindicus financings proceeded in 2012
and early 2013, the defendants ANDREW PEARSE, SURJAN SINGH and DETELINA
SUBEVA, together with others, conspired to circumvent Investment Bank 1âs internal
controls to enrich themselves and win the Proindicus business for Investment Bank 1,
including through the payment of bribes to Mozambican government officials. At the time,
PEARSE, SINGH and SUBEVA were agents acting within the scope of their employment on
behalf of Investment Bank 1, with the intent, at least in part, to benefit Investment Bank 1.

40. Investment Bank 1âs internal controls required employees, including
the compliance department and the deal team, to evaluate the potential for corruption related

to the Proindicus project and the Mozambican government officials who would be involved

12
in running it. Investment Bank 1âs review process identified certain red flags concerning the
proposed Proindicus transaction at an early stage. On or about March 9, 2012, in response
to a question from Investment Bank 1 Employee 1 as to whether there was a competitive
bidding process that resulted in Privinvest being selected, the defendant JEAN BOUSTANI
replied by email, copying the defendant SURJAN SINGH, that the selection of Privinvest
had not resulted from a competitive bid and that the deal had come about due to âhigh level
connectionsâ between Privinvest and the Mozambican government.

41.  JInor about March 2012, in anticipation of arranging financing for the
Proindicus project, Investment Bank 1 employees began conducting due diligence, or
research, on the parties involved in the project. Accordingly, as early as approximately
March 12, 2012, Investment Bank 1 employees identified allegations of corruption
associated with Privinvest Co-Conspirator 2. On that day, Investment Bank 1 Employee 1
reported to his superior and the defendant SURJAN SINGH that Investment Bank 1 had
previously designated Privinvest Co-Conspirator 2 as âan undesirable client.â Furthermore,
on or about March 13, 2012, Investment Bank 1 Employee 1 began collecting approximately
10 news articles containing potentially derogatory information regarding Privinvest Co-
Conspirator 2, and exchanged emails with SINGH regarding the information and articles.

42. Notwithstanding the existence of such red flags, while conducting due
diligence on the Proindicus transaction as required by Investment Bank 1âs internal controls,
the defendants ANDREW PEARSE, SURJAN SINGH and DETELINA SUBEVA withheld
information about the likelihood of corruption connected to the Proindicus transaction from
Investment Bank 1âs compliance department. For instance, in or about November 2012, at

the direction of the head of Investment Bank 1âs compliance department, members of the

13
Proindicus deal team consulted with a senior executive for Investment Bank 1âs Europe,
Middle East and Africa (âEMEAâ) region (the âEMEA Executiveâ), an individual whose
identity is known to the Grand Jury, regarding any legal or reputational concerns that the
Proindicus transaction might raise for the bank. On or about November 19, 2012, PEARSE
summarized those discussions in an email he sent to Investment Bank 1 Employee 1, writing
that the EMEA Executive âsaid no to the combination of Moz[ambique] and your friend
[Privinvest Co-Conspirator 2], so we need to structure him out of the picture.â Similarly,
Investment Bank | maintained a report in its due diligence files describing Privinvest Co-
Conspirator 2 as a âmaster of kickbacks.â Despite such information, PEARSE, SINGH and
Investment Bank 1 Employee 1 all failed to relay the EMEA Executiveâs concerns to
Investment Bank 1âs compliance department, and the compliance department failed to pursue
its inquiry further.

43. Furthermore, the defendants ANDREW PEARSE, SURJAN SINGH
and DETELINA SUBEVA conspired to withhold from Investment Bank 1âs compliance
department that Privinvest and Proindicus sought to appoint an individual in Mozambique
who had previously been involved in fraudulent conduct to Proindicusâs Board of Directors.
Specifically, even though Investment Bank 1 compliance personnel were responsible for
choosing an external firm to perform due diligence on Proindicusâs officers and directors, in
or about February 2013, the defendants ANDREW PEARSE, DETELINA SUBEVA and
SURJAN SINGH secretly selected a due diligence firm (âDue Diligence Firm 1â), the
identity of which is known to the Grand Jury, to research the transaction and pre-screen the
individuals identified as directors of Proindicus to secure approval by Investment Bank 1

compliance personnel.

14
44, [nor around February 2013, Due Diligence Firm 1 reported to the
defendants ANDREW PEARSE, SURJAN SINGH and DETELINA SUBEVA that one of
the proposed directors of Proindicus had previously been involved in fraudulent conduct
while he was an officer of a Mozambican state-owned company. PEARSE, SINGH and
SUBEVA did not share this information with Investment Bank 1âs compliance department.
Instead, PEARSE, SINGH and SUBEVA obtained a replacement group of directors, which
included the defendant ANTONIO DO ROSARIO, from Privinvest and Proindicus and asked
Due Diligence Firm 1 for a background investigation onthem. Due Diligence Firm 1
reported fewer red flags related to the second group of directors.

45. On or about February 26, 2013, having pre-cleared the second group of
Proindicus directors and without revealing that two separate groups of directors had been
researched, the defendant DETELINA SUBEVA forwarded the names of the second group
of proposed directors to Investment Bank 1âs compliance department for due diligence by the
firm that the compliance department had selected (âDue Diligence Firm 2â), the identity of
which is known to the Grand Jury. After reviewing a report from Due Diligence Firm 2, the
compliance department approved the new group of directors.

(4) Conspiracy to Remove or Modify Conditions on the Proindicus Loan that
Had Been Consistent with Investment Bank 1âs Internal Controls

46. As part of its system of internal controls, Investment Bank 1 imposed
conditions that Mozambique would have to meet to receive a loan. Some of those
conditions, however, carried a risk of exposing the existence of the Proindicus project to the
Mozambican public and members of Mozambiqueâs government beyond the circle of

government officials who were part of the fraudulent scheme. To conceal the fraudulent

15
scheme, avoid scrutiny and help win business for Investment Bank 1, the defendants
ANDREW PEARSE, SURJAN SINGH and DETELINA SUBEVA, together with others,
removed some of Investment Bank 1âs conditions for the Proindicus Loan.

47. For example, Investment Bank 1 originally had required Proindicus to
provide an opinion from the Attorney General of Mozambique concerning the validity of the
government guarantee. On or about February 18, 2013, the defendant JEAN BOUSTANI,
on behalf of both Privinvest and Mozambique, strenuously objected, explaining to the
defendant DETELINA SUBEVA in an email: â[T]he attorney general opinion is not
mandatory . . . I believe that this will not be accepted by Proindicus since its owner wanted to
bypass public tender and normal bureaucratic procedures from day 1 by creating a private
entity!! So they will never accept to inform the attorney general!! The [Minister of

39

Finance] guarantee is legally covered by a presidential decree.â On or before February 28,
2013, the defendants ANDREW PEARSE, SURJAN SINGH and SUBEVA, together with
others, ultimately removed the requirement from the conditions Investment Bank 1 had
imposed.

48. Similarly, on or about February 25, 2013, the defendants ANDREW
PEARSE, SURJAN SINGH and DETELINA SUBEVA, together with others, removed
Investment Bank 1âs condition that Mozambique inform the IMF of the loan. PEARSE,
SINGH and SUBEVA replaced that condition with the less stringent requirement that
Mozambique represent to investors âthat they [were] in compliance with their IMF and

World Bank obligations.â In fact, the IMF was not informed of the Proindicus Loan at the

time of the transaction. Indeed, the IMF learned of the transaction only in or about 2016,

16
when its exposure contributed to the IMFâs decision to cease providing aid and financing to
Mozambique and caused a severe financial crisis in Mozambique.

(5) The Proindicus Loan and Recruiting of Investors in the United States

49. After Investment Bank 1âs compliance department approved the
transaction on or about March 20, 2013, Investment Bank J agreed to arrange a $372 million
syndicated loan to Proindicus, guaranteed by the Republic of Mozambique, pursuant to a
written loan agreement. The defendant SURJAN SINGH signed the loan agreement on
behalf of Investment Bank 1, the defendant ANTONIO DO ROSARIO co-signed on behalf
of Proindicus and the defendant MANUEL CHANG signed the government guarantee on
behalf of Mozambique.

50. The Proindicus loan agreement provided that all payments by the
borrower or the lenders would be paid to Investment Bank 1âs bank account at a New York
City-based financial institution (âNew York City Bank 1â), the identity of which is known to
the Grand Jury. The loan agreement also required Proindicus to âapply all amounts
borrowed by it under the Facility towards the financing of the Project.â Furthermore, the
loan agreement prohibited improper payments in connection with the Proindicus project,
including payments that would violate the FCPA, the United Kingdomâs Bribery Act (âUK
Bribery Actâ) and the Mozambican Anti-Corruption Law.

| 51. Onor about March 21, 2013, Investment Bank 1 transferred the entire
proceeds of the loan, less fees totaling approximately $44 million, through a bank account at
New York City Bank 1, directly to a bank account held by Privinvest at a bank in Abu Dhabi,
UAE (âUAE Bank 1â), the identity of which is known to the Grand Jury. âInvestment Bank

1 immediately solicited United States-based investors to participate in the loan, in part by

17
sending them electronically, among other things, the Proindicus loan agreement and a
confidential information memorandum that summarized its terms.

(6) Proindicus Loan Increase and Bribe and Kickback Payments to PEARSE
and SUBEVA

52. Onor about March 28, 2013, the defendant ANDREW PEARSE
notified the defendants SURJAN SINGH and DETELINA SUBEVA and others at
Investment Bank 1 that Proindicus sought to borrow an additional $250 million from
Investment Bank 1.

53. Onor about June 13, 2013, the defendant MANUEL CHANG signed,
on behalf of Mozambique, a government guarantee for an additional $250 million in
borrowing by Proindicus. One day later, on or about June 14, 2013, Investment Bank | and
Proindicus amended their loan agreement to permit Proindicus to borrow up to an additional
$250 million from Investment Bank 1.

54. Even though Proindicus had conducted no operations, on or about June
23, 2013, Investment Bank 1âs Credit Risk Management team agreed to loan an additional
$100 million to Proindicus based on a memorandum written by the defendants ANDREW
PEARSE, SURJAN SINGH and DETELINA SUBEVA, together with others, representing
that Privinvest required additional equipment.

55. On or about June 25, 2013, Investment Bank 1 wired approximately
$100 million less its fees through New York City Bank 1 to a Privinvest account at UAE
Bank 1. Investment Bank 1 marketed and sold portions of the debt to investors, including to

an investor in the United States.

18
ay os
Rah RE

56. Throughout 2013 and 2014, using loan proceeds, Privinvest made
numerous kickback payments to the defendant ANDREW PEARSE. On or about April 15,
2013, PEARSE opened a bank account at a bank in Abu Dhabi, UAE (âUAE Bank 2â), the
identity of which is known to the Grand Jury. After PEARSE opened the account,
Privinvest wired bribe and kickback payments of more than $45 million from UAE Bank 1
accounts to PEARSEâs UAE Bank 2 account. Each payment was denominated in United
States dollars and each was routed and completed through the UAE banksâ correspondent

bank accounts in New York City and passed through the Eastern District of New York, as

57. | The defendant ANDREW PEARSE shared some of the bribes and
kickbacks that he received from the fraudulent loan proceeds with the defendant DETELINA
SUBEVA. On or about and between June 12, 2013 and October 27, 2013, PEARSE
transferred a total of approximately $2.2 million from bank accounts he held at UAE Bank 2
to a bank account SUBEVA held at UAE Bank 2.

D. EMATUM

58. Onor about August 2, 2013, EMATUM entered into an approximately
$785 million contract with Privinvest to purchase vessels, equipment and training to create a
state-owned tuna fishing company. On or about August 30, 2013, Investment Bank 1 agreed
to make up to $850 million in loans guaranteed by Mozambique to EMATUM (the
âEMATUM Loanâ). The EMATUM loan agreement was signed by, among other people,
the defendant SURJAN SINGH on behalf of Investment Bank 1 and the defendant
ANTONIO DO ROSARIO on behalf of EMATUM. The defendant MANUEL CHANG
signed the government guarantee on behalf of Mozambique. On or about September 11,
2013, Investment Bank 1 loaned approximately $500 million to EMATUM to finance the
EMATUM project and, because Investment Bank | refused to loan additional funds, on or
about October 11, 2013, Investment Bank 2 loaned an additional approximately $350 million

to EMATUM.

20
(1) The Fabricated Rationale for the EMATUM Loan

59. In or about May 2013, while Investment Bank 1 was increasing the
Proindicus Loan by approximately $100 million, the defendants ANDREW PEARSE,
DETELINA SUBEVA, JEAN BOUSTANI and ANTONIO DO ROSARIO, together with
others, agreed to a scheme for Mozambique to borrow another $850 million. A significant
portion of the additional funds would be funneled to Privinvest and then misappropriated, at
least in part, to make additional bribe and kickback payments, pay inflated profits and make
loan payments on the Proindicus Loan to prevent discovery of the co-conspiratorsâ fraudulent
scheme.

60. In approximately July 2013, the defendant ANDREW PEARSE
announced to others at Investment Bank 1 that he intended to leave the bank, but he
remained a bank employee on leave until on or about September 13, 2013. Investment Bank
1 also placed the defendant DETELINA SUBEVA on leave on or about July 22, 2013 and
terminated her on or about August 21, 2013.

61. During the summer of 2013, contrary to Investment Bank 1 policies
and procedures, the defendants ANDREW PEARSE and DETELINA SUBEVA used their
personal email accounts to conspire with Mozambican government officials and Privinvest
employees to effectuate a large loan through Investment Bank | for the EMATUM project.
For example, on or about July 4, 2013, PEARSE used his personal email account to email
SUBEVA and the defendant JEAN BOUSTANI certain questions about a proposal PEARSE
had drawn up to create a tuna fishing fleet. In response, on or about July 4, 2013,
BOUSTANI replied that the defendant ANTONIO DO ROSARIO would âgo ahead in all

suggestions needed in order to maximize funding size.â

21
62. By the end of July 2013, the defendants JEAN BOUSTANI,
ANTONIO DO ROSARIO, ANDREW PEARSE, SURJAN SINGH and DETELINA
SUBEVA, together with others, had established the details of the EMATUM project as a
pretext to justify the maximum possible loan amount, rather than to meet legitimate fishing
needs of the EMATUM project. For example, on or about July 21, 2013, BOUSTANI
emailed DO ROSARIO, copying PEARSE and SUBEVA at their personal email accounts:
â(W]e need your Marshall skills to finish by August 19 . . . we will go for 800 million$ so we
keep a cushion for Proindicus interest payment next year.â Later in the email conversation,
BOUSTANI added: âWe can decrease the trawlers to 25 and add two 45 meters OPVs
[military-style trimaran boats] with special systems to âprotectâ the trawlers. Is that better
Andrew?â PEARSE responded on or about July 21, 2013, to BOUSTANI and SUBEVA,
writing, in part: â2 big fisheries makes a lot of sense and ties into Fisheries Master Plan!â

63. Moreover, to avoid detection of the ongoing fraudulent scheme, the
defendants JEAN BOUSTANI, ANTONIO DO ROSARIO, ANDREW PEARSE and
DETELINA SUBEVA also planned to use some of the EMATUM Loan to pay the debt of
the earlier Proindicus project. On or about July 21, 2013, SUBEVA wrote an email to
BOUSTANI, PEARSE and DO ROSARIO, stating: â[W]e should also keep a cushion for
Proindicus of $17mn so that we donât need to go back to MoF [Ministry of Finance] and they
are on our side.â

(2) Conspiracy to Circumvent Investment Bank 1âs Internal Controls and
Win Business for Investment Bank 1 in Connection with the EMATUM

Project, Including Paying Bribes to Mozambican Government Officials

64. The defendants ANDREW PEARSE, SURJAN SINGH and

DETELINA SUBEVA, together with others, conspired to circumvent Investment Bank 1âs

internal controls to enrich themselves and win business for Investment Bank 1 in connection
with the EMATUM project. Thus, even though still employed by Investment Bank 1,
PEARSE and SUBEVA sought to conceal their involvement in setting up the EMATUM
project by using personal email accounts and removing all references to themselves from
documents they had prepared. For example:

(a) Onor about July 27, 2013, in response to a request from the
defendant SURJAN SINGH for information on the tuna fishing proposal, the defendant
ANDREW PEARSE used his personal email account to send an email to the defendant
JEAN BOUSTANI, copying the defendant DETELINA SUBEVA on her personal email
account, stating: âWe are going to send both shortly. Plse bro donât just forward but rather
create new email and attach the docs, [Investment Bank 1] is very sensitive to seeing our
names involved.â

(b)  Onor about July 27, 2013, the defendant DETELINA
SUBEVA, using her personal email account, sent an email concerning the tuna fishing
proposal to the defendants JEAN BOUSTANI and ANDREW PEARSE, addressing the
email to PEARSEâs personal email account, stating: âHi Jean â sending you a full info
package to please send to Surjan [SINGH] in a clean email (without my email details).â
Minutes later, SUBEVA sent documents she titled âfeasibility materialsâ and âfinancial
modelâ to BOUSTANI and PEARSE.

(c) Inresponse, on or about July 27, 2013, the defendant ANDREW
PEARSE used his personal email account to instruct the defendant DETELINA SUBEVA on
her personal email account: â[I]f you go into the properties of each doc, it shows you as the

author. You may want to delete [the metadata] and resendâ the documents. Later the same

23
day, using the same personal email accounts, SUBEVA sent an email to PEARSE stating:
âIâm sure Surj [SINGH] can sanitize worst comes to worst and delete the author.â

65. In addition, the defendants JEAN BOUSTANI, ANDREW PEARSE,
SURJAN SINGH and DETELINA SUBEVA created fake competing bids from contractors
for the EMATUM project in anticipation of an inquiry from Investment Bank 1 as to why
Privinvest would be awarded the project. For example, on or about July 31, 2013, PEARSE
sent an email to the BOUSTANI and SUBEVA stating: âGuys, below is the argument that I
think we (or rather the Borrower) should present to [Investment Bank 1] next week when in
Maputo .... The sponsors of the Borrower (ie the various Ministries, but principally SISE)
at the behest of the President went out to 4 shipyards [we need to have names] asking for
proposals to build a fleet... . There was no need legally to have a public tender as
procurement rules donât apply to private companies, but nonetheless they sought a number of
bids. [ JONLY ADM [a Privinvest entity] responded with the full package and offered an
integrated solution with fishing surveillance, command center and boats.â BOUSTANI
replied: âLetâs say they contacted South African yards and Spanish + Portuguese. Without
naming.â

66.  Inan effort to ensure that Investment Bank 1 would arrange the
EMATUM Loan, the defendant SURJAN SINGH included fake bid information in a
memorandum he wrote and submitted to Investment Bank 1 in or about August 2013 to gain
approval for the EMATUM Loan, falsely asserting that the Privinvest proposal was deemed
the most competitive one in comparison to bids from three other international companies.

67. Moreover, in or about early August 2013, the defendant SURJAN

SINGH travelled to Mozambique to lead Investment Bank 1âs due diligence for the
24
EMATUM transaction. In furtherance of the fraudulent scheme, SINGH and the defendants
ANDREW PEARSE and DETELINA SUBEVA provided talking points and suggested
answers to Mozambican government officials for due diligence meetings with Investment
Bank | in an effort to ensure that Investment Bank 1 would arrange the loan.

68. The defendants ANDREW PEARSE and DETELINA SUBEVA, with
the knowledge of the defendant SURJAN SINGH, also continued to hide their own
involvement in the due diligence process. On or about August 4, 2013, SUBEVA sent an
email to the defendant JEAN BOUSTANI, copying PEARSE, stating: âPlse remind [the
defendant ANTONIO DO ROSARIO] not to mention Andrew [PEARSE] and myself to the
[Investment Bank 1] team! They cannot know we are involved in this project!!!!_ If there is
a slip up, say he knows us from the previous deal.â

(3) The EMATUM Loan Agreement and Solicitation of United States
Investors

69. Onor about August 30, 2013, Investment Bank 1 entered into the
$850 million loan agreement with EMATUM. The EMATUM loan agreement was signed
by, among others, the defendant SURJAN SINGH on behalf of Investment Bank 1 and the
defendant ANTONIO DO ROSARIO on behalf of EMATUM. The defendant MANUEL
CHANG signed the government guarantee on behalf of Mozambique.

70. |The EMATUM loan agreement provided that all payments by the
borrower or the lenders would be paid to Investment Bank 1âs bank account at New York
City Bank 1. The agreement also required EMATUM to âapply all amounts borrowed by it
under the [EMATUM loan agreement] towards . . . the purchase of fishing infrastructure,

33

comprising of 27 vessels, an operations centre, and related training.â The loan agreement

25
also prohibited improper payments in connection with the project, including payments that
would violate the FCPA, the UK Bribery Act and the Mozambican Anti-Corruption Law.

71. Onor about September 11, 2013, Investment Bank 1 sent $500 million
in loan proceeds, less its fees, to Privinvest. Investment Bank 1 funded the EMATUM Loan
by selling loan participation notes to investors in the United States and elsewhere. By email
and other electronic means, Investment Bank 1 sent potential investors, including United
States investors, materials that included the EMATUM loan agreement and an offering
circular. Like the loan agreement, the offering circular stated: âThe proceeds from the Loan
will be used by the Borrower towards the financing of the purchase of fishing infrastructure,
comprising of 27 vessels, an operations centre and related training and for the general
corporate purposes of the Borrower.â

72.  Inreliance on the representations in the loan agreement and offering
circular, investors, including investors in the United States, purchased EMATUM loan
participation notes.

73. Despite projections that EMATUM would generate annual fishing
revenues of approximately $224 million by December 2016, it generated virtually no revenues
and, as of approximately late 2017, conducted no fishing operations. EMATUM defaulted
on its financing payment due on or about January 18, 2017.

(4) Bribes and Kickbacks to the Defendant SURJAN SINGH and
Mozambican Government Officials

74. The defendant SURJAN SINGH also received bribe and kickback
payments directly from Privinvest for his role in the fraudulent scheme. Specifically, on or

about October 20, 2013, the defendant ANDREW PEARSE sent an email to the defendant

26
JEAN BOUSTANI with SINGHâs bank account information at UAE Bank 2, referring to
SINGH as âUncle,â and adding, â[i]f we can do something this week he would appreciate it.â
That same day, on or about October 20, 2013, BOUSTANI forwarded the request to the
defendant NAJIB ALLAM, writing, âUncle... Surjan. Total of 4.â

75. Onor about and between October 23, 2013 and February 27, 2014,
Privinvest wired approximately six payments totaling approximately $4.49 million from its
bank account at UAE Bank 1 to the defendant SURJAN SINGHâs UAE Bank 2 account.
Each payment was routed through the UAE banksâ correspondent bank accounts in New

York City. Privinvest made the following bribe and kickback payments to SINGH:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Date Amount Wire Instruction
October 23, 2013 $800,000 | âpymt on consultancy agreementâ
November 27, 2013 $800,000 | âpmt on consultancy agreementâ
December 23, 2013 $800,000 | âpyt on consultancy agreementâ
January 27, 2014 $800,000 | âpyt on consultancy agreementâ
January 28, 2014 $799,960 | âpyt on consultancy agreementâ
February 27, 2014 $500,000 | âpyt on consultancy agreement.â

 

 

 

 

 

76. The defendants JEAN BOUSTANI and NAJIB ALLAM continued to
coordinate the payment of bribes to Mozambican government officials. On or about April 8,
2014, BOUSTANI sent an email to ALLAM, providing an accounting of bribes through the
Proindicus and EMATUM projects and stating that Privinvest had paid â125 [million U.S.
dollars] for all for everything ....â.- BOUSTANI summarized the distribution of the bribes,
including $8.5 million to the defendant TEOFILO NHANGUMELE, $8.5 million to

Mozambican Co-Conspirator 1, $15 million to the defendant ANTONIO DO ROSARIO,
27
$7 million to the defendant MANUEL CHANG and $3 million to Mozambican Co-
Conspirator 3, among others.

77. Inan effort to conceal the unlawful nature of these payments, the
defendants JEAN BOUSTANI, NAJIB ALLAM and ANTONIO DO ROSARIO used third-
party entities and fabricated invoices to distribute money to the Mozambican government
officials. For example, on or about October 17, 2013, BOUSTANI wrote an email to DO
ROSARIO, stating: âI need asap invoices in the name of: Logistics International Abu Dhabi
[a Privinvest-related company]. Invoices for everything my brother. Each one mentioning
the subject (real estate purchase...etc....). Even for Pantero [the defendant MANUEL
CHANG], a small paper say âconsultancy fees.ââ

78. Accordingly, on or about and between October 20, 2013 and December
4, 2013, the defendant JEAN BOUSTANI caused Privinvest to make bribe payments of
approximately $5 million, from Privinvestâs UAE-based bank account, through the Eastern
District of New York, to a bank account in the name of a company controlled by the
defendant MANUEL CHANG.

E. MAM

(1) MAM Loan Agreement

79. Onor about May 1, 2014, MAM and Privinvest executed an
approximately $500 million contract for Privinvest to, among other things, build a shipyard,
provide additional naval vessels and upgrade two existing facilities to service Proindicus and
EMATUM vessels.

80. On or about May 20, 2014, Investment Bank 2 and the Privinvest entity

Palomar, acting through the defendants ANDREW PEARSE and DETELINA SUBEVA,
28
together with others, arranged a syndicated loan of up to $540 million to MAM, guaranteed
by the Republic of Mozambique (the âMAM Loanâ). Investment Bank 2 solicited investors,
using, among other things, the MAM loan agreement and a confidential information
memorandum that summarized its terms. As with the Proindicus and the EMATUM loans,
the loan agreement required that the MAM loan proceeds be used for project purposes and
prohibited illegal and corrupt payments. The defendant ANTONIO DO ROSARIO signed
the loan agreement on behalf of MAM, and the defendant MANUEL CHANG signed the
government guarantee on behalf of Mozambique.

81. |The MAM loan agreement also provided that all payments required
under the agreement were to be made through a bank account in New York City at a New
York City-based financial institution (âNew York City Bank 2â), the identity of which is
known to the Grand Jury.

82. Onor about and between approximately May 23, 2014 and June 11,
2014, MAM borrowed approximately $535 million from Investment Bank 2, guaranteed by
the Republic of Mozambique, which Investment Bank 2 sent directly to Privinvest through
correspondent bank accounts at New York City Bank 2.

(2) MAM Bribe and Kickback Payments

83. An accounting spreadsheet maintained by the defendant NAJIB
ALLAM reflected that Privinvest made bribe and kickback payments to obtain the MAM
contract. Such payments included approximately $13 million to the defendant ANTONIO
DO ROSARIO, approximately $5 million to the defendant MANUEL CHANG,
approximately $918,000 to Mozambican Co-Conspirator 2 and approximately $1.8 million to

Mozambican Co-Conspirator 3.

29
84. Despite projecting approximately $63 million in operating revenues by
the end of its first year of operations, MAM generated virtually no revenues and defaulted on
its loan payment due on or about May 23, 2016.

F, EMATUM Exchange

85.  Inor about 2015, Proindicus, EMATUM, MAM and Mozambique
encountered problems servicing the approximately $2 billion in debt they had amassed in
2013 and 2014, including as a result of the Proindicus, EMATUM and MAM Loans.
Furthermore, at around the same time, Mozambican government officials, including the
defendant ANTONIO DO ROSARIO, received inquiries from the IMF concerning the use of
some of the loan proceeds.

86. To hide from the public and the IMF the near bankruptcy of the project
companies resulting from loan proceeds being diverted as part of the fraudulent scheme,
avoid inquiry from the IMF and conceal discovery of the scheme, several of the co-
conspirators, including the defendants JEAN BOUSTANI, ANDREW PEARSE and
DETELINA SUBEVA, proposed to exchange the EMATUM loan participation notes for
Eurobonds issued directly by the Mozambican government.

87. In furtherance of the fraudulent scheme, in or about and between March
2015 and May 2015, Investment Bank 1 employees, together with the defendants JEAN
BOUSTANI, ANDREW PEARSE and DETELINA SUBEVA, organized meetings with
Mozambican government officials to convince them to restructure the existing loans by
converting them into Eurobonds. The Mozambican government accepted the co-

conspiratorsâ recommendation and hired Investment Bank 1 and Investment Bank 2 to

30
tA
speck

conduct the exchange and Palomar, which employed PEARSE and SUBEVA, as an adviser
for the exchange.

88. Onor about March 9, 2016, Investment Bank 1 and Investment Bank 2
announced the exchange. To convince investors to exchange their loan participation notes
for Eurobonds, the defendants ANDREW PEARSE and DETELINA SUBEVA, together
with bankers at Investment Bank 1 and Investment Bank 2, prepared documents that were
sent to investors, including in the United States. The exchange documents failed to
adequately disclose the existence of the Proindicus and MAM Loans or the maturity dates of
those loans. The documents therefore contained false and misleading information about the
Eurobonds and Mozambiqueâs creditworthiness.

89. By onor about April 6, 2016, based upon the co-conspiratorsâ false and
misleading information, the EMATUM investors consented to the exchange, resulting in the

exchange of the EMATUM LPNs for Eurobonds on that same day.

G. Proindicus, EMATUM and MAM Loan Defaults

 

90. Following the 2016 EMATUM exchange, in or about and between May
2016 and March 2017, Proindicus, EMATUM and MAM each defaulted on their loans, and
Proindicus, EMATUM and MAM proceeded to miss more than $700 million in loan
payments.
H. Summary of Bribe and Kickback Payments
91. In furtherance of the fraudulent scheme, numerous Mozambican
government officials received bribe and kickback payments from Privinvest in connection

with the Mozambican projects. Specifically:

3]
(a) The defendant MANUEL CHANG received at least $5 million
in bribe and kickback payments from Privinvest.

(b) The defendant ANTONIO DO ROSARIO received at least
$12 million in bribe and kickback payments from Privinvest.

â(c) The defendant TEOFILO NHANGUMELE received at least

$8.5 million in bribe and kickback payments from Privinvest.

(d) | Mozambican Co-Conspirator 1 received at least $8.5 million in
bribe and kickback payments from Privinvest.

(ce) Mozambican Co-Conspirator 2 received at least $9.7 million in
bribe and kickback payments from Privinvest.

(f) Mozambican Co-Conspirator 3 received at least $2 million in
bribe and kickback payments from Privinvest.

92. The defendant JEAN BOUSTANI received approximately $15 million
from the proceeds of Privinvestâs fraudulent scheme. In or about and between May 2013
and July 2014, Privinvest paid BOUSTANI these funds in a series of wire transfers, many of
which were paid through a correspondent bank account in New York City and passed
through the Eastern District of New York.
93. Also in furtherance of the scheme, the defendants ANDREW PEARSE,

SURJAN SINGH and DETELINA SUBEVA received bribe and kickback payments in
connection with the Mozambican projects. Specifically:

(a) | The defendant ANDREW PEARSE received over $45 million
in bribe and kickback payments from Privinvest in connection with the Mozambican

maritime projects. Many of these bribe and kickback payments were paid through a

32
correspondent bank account in New York City and passed through the Eastern District of
New York.

(b) The defendant SURJAN SINGH received bribe and kickback
payments totaling approximately $4.5 million from Privinvest. At least one bribe and
kickback payment from Privinvest was paid through a correspondent account in New York
City and passed through the Eastern District of New York.

(c) The defendant DETELINA SUBEVA received bribe and
kickback payments of at least $2.2 million from the defendant ANDREW PEARSE.

COUNT THREE
(Conspiracy to Violate the FCPA Anti-Bribery and Internal Controls Provisions)

99. The allegations contained in paragraphs one through 93 are realleged

OVERT ACTS

(a) Onor about November 19, 2012, PEARSE sent an email to
Investment Bank 1 Employee 1, stating that the EMEA Executive âsaid no to the
combination of Moz[ambique] and your friend [Privinvest Co-Conspirator 2], so we need to
structure him out of the picture.â

(b)  Inor about February 2013, PEARSE, SINGH and SUBEVA
commissioned Due Diligence Firm 1 to advise on potential corruption and bribery risks
involving members of the Mozambican government in the contemplated Privinvest
transaction, which diligence PEARSE, SINGH and SUBEVA then purposefully concealed
from Investment Bank 1âs compliance department.

(c) On or about February 15, 2013, SINGH and SUBEVA provided
a list of Proindicusâs intended directors to Due Diligence Firm 1 to pre-screen the potential

directors.

39
(d) Onor about June 21, 2013, PEARSE, SINGH and SUBEVA
submitted a memorandum to Investment Bank 1âs Credit Risk Management team that falsely
described why the Proindicus Loan was being increased and failed to inform Investment
Bank 1 that the proposed loan increase was being used to make bribe and kickback payments
to the co-conspirators, including Mozambican government officials.

(e)  Onor about July 8, 2013, Privinvest made a payment of $1
million from its bank account in the UAE to a bank account in Portugal for the benefit of DO

the documents.

(g) On or about August 4, 2013, SUBEVA, using her personal
email account, sent an email to PEARSE at his personal email account that stated: â[A]s
promised, below is suggested âscriptâ for the DD [due diligence] meeting with the lady from
Ministry of Fisheries. These questions have been answered very well before so should
ensure a very productive low risk meeting. It overlaps well with the [Investment Bank 1]
list.â

(h) Onor about August 4, 2013, SUBEVA sent an email to DO
ROSARIO providing information for a due diligence meeting with Investment Bank 1

scheduled for the next day.

40
(i) On or about August 5, 2013, SUBEVA used her personal email

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Thursday, March 7, 2019

Mozambiqueâs Former Finance Minister Indicted Alongside Other Former Mozambican Officials,
Business Executives, and Investment Bankers in Alleged $2 Billion Fraud and Money Laundering
Scheme that Victimized U.S. Investors

More Than $200 Million in Alleged Bribes and Kickbacks Paid to Mozambican Government Officials and
Investment Bankers in Corrupt Maritime Loans for Mozambique

A four-count indictment was returned on Dec. 19, 2018, by a grand jury in the Eastern District of New York, charging two executives of a
shipbuilding company, three former senior Mozambican government officials, and three former London-based investment bankers for their roles
in a $2 billion fraud and money laundering scheme that victimized investors from the United States and elsewhere.

Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Richard P. Donoghue of the Eastern
District of New York, and Assistant Director in Charge William F. Sweeney Jr. of the FBIâs New York Field Office made the announcement.

âThe indictment unsealed today alleges a brazen international criminal scheme in which corrupt Mozambique government officials, corporate
executives, and investment bankers stole approximately $200 million in loan proceeds that were meant to benefit the people of Mozambique,â
said Assistant Attorney General Benczkowski. âThe Department of Justice and our law enforcement partners are dedicated to using all tools at
our disposal to prosecute those who engage in money laundering, financial fraud and corruption at the expense of U.S. investors, wherever
those individuals may be located.â

âAs charged in the indictment, the defendants orchestrated an immense fraud and bribery scheme that took advantage of the U.S. financial
system, defrauded its investors and adversely impacted the economy of Mozambique, in order to line their own pockets with hundreds of
millions of dollars,â said U.S. Attorney Donoghue. âThis indictment underscores the Department of Justiceâs continuing efforts to end such
fraudulent and corrupt practices and to hold those responsible to account for their crimes.â

âToday's indictment proves that no matter who you are, or what position of power you're in, you're not immune from prosecution,â said FBI
Assistant Director in Charge Sweeney. âThe FBI will continue to use all resources at our disposal to uncover crimes of this nature and expose
them for what they really are.â

Jean Boustani, 40, a citizen of Lebanon who worked for the Privinvest Group, a United Arab Emirates-based shipbuilding company, was arrested
at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York on Jan. 2, 2019 and arraigned later that day in the Eastern District of New York on charges that he
conspired with others to commit one count of wire fraud, one count of securities fraud, and one count of money laundering in connection with
$200 million in bribe and kickback payments he helped organize relating to three loans totaling more than $2 billion that were marketed and
sold to U.S. victim investors. Boustani has pleaded not guilty to the charges; a trial date has not yet been set. Alongside Boustani, Privinvestâs
chief financial officer Najib Allam, 58, a citizen of Lebanon, was charged with the same counts. Allam is alleged to have worked with Boustani to
make the bribe and kickback payments. Allam is not currently in U.S. custody.

Manuel Chang, 63, the former Mozambican minister of finance who is a citizen and resident of Mozambique, was charged with the same counts
as Boustani, namely one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, and one count of
conspiracy to commit money laundering. Chang was arrested at the request of the United States by South African authorities on Dec. 29,
2018. The United States is seeking Changâs extradition.

Antonio do Rosario, 44, a citizen and resident of Mozambique, was an official with Mozambiqueâs State Information and Security Service and a
director and officer of each of the three Mozambican entities that obtained the maritime loans. Do Rosario was charged with one count of
conspiracy to commit wire fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering
in connection with his receipt of bribe payments relating to the loans. Do Rosario is not currently in U.S. custody.

Teofilo Nhangumele, 50, a citizen and resident of Mozambique, acted on behalf of the Office of the President of Mozambique. Nhangumele was
charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering in connection with his
negotiation and receipt of bribe payments relating to the loans. Nhangumele is not currently in U.S. custody.

The three investment bankers, Andrew Pearse, 49; Surjan Singh, 44; and Detelina Subeva, 37, each of whom is a resident of the United
Kingdom, were also charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, and one
count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. In addition, each banker was charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery
and internal controls provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) in connection with their roles in facilitating bribe payments to
government officials in Mozambique and for circumventing the internal accounting controls of a foreign investment bank that arranged two of
the loans. At the time, Pearse and Singh were managing directors of the investment bank, and Subeva was a vice president.

Pearse, Singh and Subeva were arrested on Jan. 3, in the United Kingdom, all pursuant to provisional arrest warrants issued at the request of
the United States. The United States is seeking their extradition.

The indictment alleges that between approximately 2013 and 2016, the co-conspirators organized for more than $2 billion in three loans to be
arranged by Investment Bank and another foreign bank. The loans were made to companies owned and controlled by the Mozambican
government: Proindicus S.A., Empresa Mocambicana de Atum, S.A. (EMATUM) and Mozambique Asset Management (MAM). The money was
purportedly to be used to fund three maritime projects for which the shipbuilder, Privinvest, would provide the equipment and services.
Proindicus was to perform coastal surveillance, EMATUM was to engage in tuna fishing, and MAM was to build and maintain shipyards. Chang,
in his capacity as minister of finance, signed guarantees on behalf of Mozambique for all three fraudulent loans. Singh signed the agreements
on behalf of the investment bank for the two loans on which the bank acted as primary arranger. The investment bank subsequently paid the
loans directly to Privinvest.

As further alleged in the indictment, the co-conspirators facilitated Privinvestâs criminal diversion of more than $200 million in loan proceeds,
including more than $150 million in bribe payments to Chang and other Mozambican government officials that Privinvest paid to ensure that
Mozambique would enter into the loan arrangements. In addition to the bribe payments, the alleged fraud also included approximately $50
million in kickback payments to Pearse, Singh, and Subeva, who assisted the conspirators to obtain financing for the loans through their
investment bank and a second foreign investment bank. Pearse, Singh, and Subeva, along with the other members of the conspiracy, allegedly
subsequently sold the loans to investors worldwide, including in the United States. Moreover, the participants in the scheme allegedly
conspired to defraud these investors by misrepresenting how the loan proceeds would be used, the amount and maturity dates of other loans
and debt Mozambique was obligated to pay, and the ability of Mozambique or its state-owned entities to repay the loans.

Mozambique and its state-owned entities have thus far allegedly failed to make more than $700 million of repayments that have become due
on the loans.

The charges in the indictment are merely allegations, and the defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt
in a court of law.

The investigation is being conducted by the FBIâs New York Field Office. The governmentâs case is being prosecuted by the Criminal Divisionâs
Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section (MLARS) and Fraud Section, and the Business and Securities Fraud Section of the U.S. Attorney's
Office for the Eastern District of New York. MLARS Trial Attorneys Sean W. O'Donnell and Margaret A. Moeser, Fraud Section Trial Attorney
David M. Fuhr, and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Matthew S. Amatruda and Mark E. Bini of the Eastern District of New York are prosecuting the case.

The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs provided critical assistance in this case. The Department appreciates the significant
cooperation and assistance provided by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Department also appreciates the assistance provided by
law enforcement authorities in the United Kingdom and in South Africa.

MLARS'âs Bank Integrity Unit investigates and prosecutes banks and other financial institutions, including their officers, managers, and
employees, whose actions threaten the integrity of the individual institution or the wider financial system.

The Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice
Departmentâs FCPA enforcement efforts can be found at www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.

not binding on the probation office or the Court, they will jointly
recommend that the Court make the following findings and
conclusions as to the sentence to be imposed, with both parties
reserving the right to argue regarding the application or non-

application of other guideline provisions not addressed below:
   

 

a. Base offense level: Pursuant to U.S.S.G. Â§ 2S51.1(a) (1),
that the base offense level for purposes of sentencing guideline
calculations for the charged offenses is 12 (see Â§2C1.1), plus the
number of offense levels from the table in Â§2Bl1.1 corresponding to
the value of the unlawful payments /laundered funds (more than $3.5
million and less than $9.5 million), adding 18 levels;

b. Offense of conviction: That a two-level enhancement of the

 

}

guideline offense level applies under U.S.S.G. Â§ 2.S1.1(b) (2) (B)

_ for a conviction under Title 18, United States Code, Section 1956;

offense level applies since the offense involved sophisticated
means pursuant to U.S.S.G. Â§ 2S1.1(b) (3); and

d. the defendant has a Criminal History Category of I.

9. In the event that the defendant chooses toâ seek a variance
from the sentencing guideline range, the defendant further agrees
that any such application shall be filed in writing with the Court
and served on the United States no later than the deadline for
submitting objections to the Pre-Sentence Investigation Report
stated in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(f) (1). 7

capacity, to forfeit to the United States, voluntarily and

14. The defendant is aware that Title 18, United States
Code, Section 3742 and Title 28, United States Code, Section 1291
afford the defendant the right to appeal the sentence imposed in

this case. Acknowledging this, in exchange for the undertakings

made by the United States in this plea agreement, the defendant

hereby waives all rights conferred by Sections 3742 and 1291 to
appeal any sentence imposed, including any restitution order, or
to appeal the manner in which the sentence was imposed, unless the
sentence exceeds the maximum permitted by statute or is the result
of an upward departure and/or an upward variance from the advisory

guideline range that the Court establishes at sentencing. The

10

 

\aA

 

 

 
defendant further understands that nothing in this agreement shall
affect the Governmentâs right and/or duty to appeal as set forth
in Title 18, United States Code, Section 3742(b) and Title 28,
United States Code, Section 1291. However, if the United States
appeals the defendantâs sentence pursuant to Sections 3742(b) and
1291, the defendant shall be released from the above waiver of
appellate rights. In addition to the foregoing provisions, the
defendant hereby waives all rights to argue on appeal that the
statute to which the defendant is pleading guilty is
unconstitutional and that the admitted conduct does not fall within
the scope of the statute. By signing this agreement, the defendant
acknowledges that the defendant has discussed the appeal waiver
set forth in this agreement with the defendantâs attorney.

15. The defendant.is aware that the sentence has not yet
been determined by the Court. The defendant also is aware that
any estimate of the probable sentencing range or sentence that the
defendant may receive, whether that estimate comes from the
defendantâs attorney, the Government, ox the probation office, is
a prediction, not a promise, and is not binding on the Government,

the probation office, or the Court. The defendant understands

further that any recommendation that the Government makes to theâ

Court as to sentencing, whether pursuant to this agreement or

otherwise, is not binding on the Court, and the Court may disregard

â11

 

 
the recommendation in its entirety. The defendant understands and
acknowledges, as previously acknowledged. in paragraph 2 above,
that the defendant may not withdraw his plea based upon the Courtâs
decision not to accept a sentencing recommendation made by the
defendant, the Government, or a recommendation made jointly by
both the defendant and the Government.

16. The defendant agrees that, effective as of the date the
defendant signs this Plea Agreement and the Factual Proffer, and
notwithstanding any other subsequent event, including but not
limited to the defendantâs failure to plead guilty, the Courtâs
refusal to accept the defendantâs guilty plea, or the defendantâs
withdrawal (or attempted withdrawal). of his guilty plea, the
Factual Proffer entered in connection with this Plea Agreement
shall be admissible against the defendant in any criminal case
involving the Fraud Section and the defendant, as: (a) substantive
evidence offered by the government in its case-in-chief and
rebuttal case; (b) impeachment evidence offered -by the government
on cross-examination; and (c) evidence at any sentencing hearing
or other hearing. In addition, the defendant also agrees not to
assert any claim under the Federal Rules of Evidence (including
Rule 410 of the Federal Rules of Evidence), the Federal Rules of
Criminal Procedure (including Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of

Criminal Procedure), or the United States Sentencing Guidelines

(including U.S.S.G. Â§ 1B1.1(a)) that the Factual Proffer entered
in connection with this Plea Agreement should be suppressed or is
otherwise inadmissible as evidence (in any form).

17. The defendant recognizes that pleading guilty may have
consequences with respect to the defendantâs immigration status if
the defendant is not a citizen of the United States. Under federal
law, a broad range of crimes are removable offenses, including the
offense to which the defendant is. pleading guilty. Indeed,
because the defendant is pleading guilty to a conspiracy to launder
money, removal is presumptively mandatory. Removal and other
âimmigration consequences are the subjÃ©ctâ of a separate proceeding,
however, and defendant understands that no one, including the
defendantâs attorney or the Court, can predict to a certainty the
effect of the defendantâs conviction on the defendantâs
immigration status. Defendant nevertheless affirms that the
defendant wants to plead guilty regardless of any immigration
_ consequences that the defendantâ s plea may entail, even if the
consequence is the defendantâ s automatic removal from the United

States.

18.Â° This is the entire agreement and understanding between
the United States and the defendant. There are no other

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Thursday, January 23, 2020

Miami-Based Businessman Pleads Guilty to FCPA and Money Laundering Violations in Scheme
Involving PetroEcuador Officials

An Ecuadorian businessman living in Miami, Florida, pleaded guilty today in connection with a $4.4 million bribery and money laundering
scheme that funneled bribes to public officials of Empresa Publica de Hidrocarburos del Ecuador (PetroEcuador), the state-owned and state-
controlled oil company of Ecuador, announced Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division
and Special Agent in Charge George L. Piro of the FBI's Miami Field Office.

Armengol Alfonso Cevallos Diaz (Cevallos), 57, pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Rodney Smith of the Southern District of Florida to one
count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. Sentencing is
scheduled for April 2, 2020.

Cevallos admitted at the plea hearing that, from 2012 through 2015, he conspired with others to pay bribes of $4.4 million to PetroEcuador
officials by using the mails and means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce, including U.S.-based companies and U.S.-based bank
accounts, in order to obtain and retain business. Cevallos also admitted that he conspired with others to conceal and promote the bribe scheme
by laundering funds through Miami-based shell companies and bank accounts and by purchasing properties in the Miami area for the benefit of
certain PetroEcuador officials. Specifically, as alleged in the indictment, Cevallos admitted that he solicited and intermediated bribe payments
from an oil services company for the benefit of PetroEcuador officials, and that he helped launder those bribes and others he had paid to
PetroEcuador officials on behalf of Ecuadorian contractors and his own companies.

Todayâs plea follows 12 public charges and guilty pleas against other individuals in the departmentâs ongoing investigation into bribery and
money laundering involving PetroEcuador. The individuals who have been charged to date for their roles in the bribery and money laundering
schemes include former PetroEcuador officials who received and concealed the bribe payments, businessmen and contractors who paid the
bribes to obtain lucrative oil services contracts from PetroEcuador, and financial advisors and other intermediaries who enabled and facilitated
the bribery through the use of U.S. and offshore companies and bank accounts.

The FBI's International Corruption Squad in Miami is investigating the case. Assistant Chiefs David Fuhr and Lorinda Laryea and Trial Attorneys
Jonathan Robell and Katherine Raut of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Trial Attorneys Mary Ann McCarthy and Randall Warden of the
Criminal Divisionâs Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section (MLARS) are prosecuting the case.

IRS-Criminal Investigation, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcementâs Homeland Security Investigations, the U.S. Marshals Service and the
Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs have provided significant assistance in this case, as have public authorities in, among other
countries, Ecuador and Panama.

MLARS'âs Bank Integrity Unit investigates and prosecutes banks and other financial institutions, including their officers, managers, and
employees, whose actions threaten the integrity of the individual institution or the wider financial system.

The Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice Departmentâs FCPA

enforcement efforts can be found at www. justice. gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.

Case 11e-cr-20108-CMA Document ly Entered on FLSD Docket Oa/2e/2078

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA

Case No. 18-20108-CR-ALTONAGA

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
vs.

ARTURO ESCOBAR DOMINGUEZ

 

PLEA AGREEMENT

The United States Attorneyâs Office for the Southern District
of Florida, the United States Department of Justice, Criminal
Division, Fraud Section and Money Laundering & Asset Recovery
Section (collectively, the âGovernmentâ or the âUnited Statesâ),

-and Arturo Escobar Dominguez (hereinafter referred to as the
âdefendantâ) enter into the following agreement:

1. The defendant agrees to waive indictment and to plead
guilty to the one-count Information filed in this case, which
charges âthe defendant with conspiracy to launder money, in
violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1956(h).

2. The defendant is aware that the sentence will be imposed
by the Court after considering the Federal Sentencing Guidelines
and Policy Statements (hereinafter, the âSentencing Guidelinesâ),
as well as other factors enumerated in Title 18, United States
Code, Section 3553(a). The defendant acknowledges and understands
that the Court will compute an advisory sentence under the

1
Case D18-cr-PO168-CMA Document iy Entered an FLSO Docket 03/28/2018

Sentencing Guidelines and that the applicable guidelines will be
determined by the Court relying in part on the results of a Pre-
Sentence Investigation by the Courtâs probation office, which
investigation will commence after the guilty plea has been entered.
The defendant is also aware that, under certain circumstances, the
Court may depart from the advisory sentencing guideline range that
it has computed, and may raise or lower that advisory sentence
under the Sentencing Guidelines. The defendant is further aware
and understands that the Court is required to consider the advisory
guideline range determined under the Sentencing Guidelines but is
not bound to impose that sentence; the Court is permitted to tailor
the ultimate sentence in light of other statutory concerns, and
such sentence may be either more severe or less severe than the
Sentencing Guidelinesâ advisory sentence. Knowing these facts,
the defendant understands and acknowledges that the Court has the
authority to impose any sentence within and up to the statutory
maximum authorized by law for the offense identified in paragraph
1, and that the defendant may not withdraw the plea solely as a
result of the sentence imposed.

3. The defendant also understands and acknowledges that for
the charge in the Information of conspiracy to launder money in
violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1956(h), the
Court may impose a statutory maximum term of imprisonment of up to

20 years, followed by a term of supervised release of up to five

years. In addition to a term of imprisonment and supervised
release, the Court may impose a fine of up to $500,000, or twice
the value of the property involved in the transactions for which
the defendant conspired to launder, whichever is greater, and the
Court may also order forfeiture and restitution.

4. The defendant further understands and acknowledges that,
in addition to any sentence imposed under paragraph 3 of this
agreement, a special assessment in the amount of $100 per count
will be imposed on the defendant. The defendant agrees that any
special assessment imposed shall be paid at the time of sentencing.
If the defendant is financially unable to pay the special
assessment, the defendant agrees to present evidence to the
Government and the Court at the time of sentencing as to the
reasons for the defendantâs failure to pay.

5. The Government reserves the right to inform the Court and
the probation office of all facts pertinent to the sentencing
process, including all relevant information concerning the
offenses committed, whether charged or not, as well as concerning
the defendant and the defendantâs background. Subject only to the
express terms of any agreed-upon sentencing recommendations
contained in this agreement, the Government further reserves the
right to make any recommendation as to the quality and quantity of

punishment.
Case D:18-cr-20108-CMA Bocumenti?y Entered on FLSD Docket O3/2a/2018 Page 4 of 15

6. The Government agrees to recommend at sentencing that the
Court reduce by two levels the sentencing guideline level
applicable to the defendantâs offense, pursuant to Section
3E1.1(a) of the Sentencing Guidelines, based upon the defendantâs
recognition and affirmative and timely acceptance of personal
responsibility. If at the time of sentencing the defendant's
offense level is determined to be 16 or greater, the Government
will make a motion requesting an additional one-level decrease Â©
pursuant to Section 3E1.1(b) of the Sentencing Guidelines, stating
that the defendant has assisted authorities in the investigation
or prosecution of his own misconduct by timely notifying
authorities of his intention to enter a plea of guilty, thereby
permitting the Government to avoid preparing for trial and
permitting the Government and the Court to allocate their resources
efficiently. The Government, however, will not be required to
make this motion and this recommendation if the defendant: (1)
fails or refuses to make a full, accurate, and complete disclosure
to the probation office of the circumstances surrounding the
relevant offense conduct; (2) is found to have misrepresented facts
to the Government prior to entering into this plea agreement; or
(3) commits any misconduct after entering into this plea agreement,
including but not limited to committing a state or federal offense,
violating ahy term of release, or making false statements or

misrepresentations to any governmental entity or official.

4
Case D:18-cr-20108-CMA Bocumenti?y Entered on FLSD Docket O3/2a/2018 Page 5 of 15

7. The Government and the defendant agree that, although
not binding on the probation office or the Court, they will jointly
recommend that the Court make the following findings and
conclusions as to the sentence to be imposed:

a. Base offense level: Pursuant to U.S.S.G. Â§ 2S1.1(a) (2),

 

that the base offense level for purposes of sentencing guideline
calculations for the charged offense is 8 plus the number of
- offense levels from the table in Â§2B1.1 corresponding to the value
of the laundered funds (more than $1.5 million and less than $3.5

million), adding 16 levels, for a total base offense level of 24;

b. Offense of conviction: That a two-level enhancement of

 

the guideline offense level applies under U.S.S.G. Â§
2.91.1(b) (2) (B) for a conviction under Title 18, United States
Code, Section 1956;

Cc. Sophisticated means: That a two-level increase to the

 

offense level applies since the offense involved sophisticated
means pursuant to U.S.S.G. Â§ 251.1(b) (3); and

d. The defendant has a Criminal History Category of I.

8. The defendant agrees that he shall cooperate fully with
the Government by: (a) providing truthful and complete information
and testimony, and producing documents, records and other
evidence, when called upon by the Government, whether in
interviews, before a grand jury, or at any trial or other Court

proceeding; (ob) appearing at such grand jury proceedings,
Case D18-cr-PO168-CMA Document iy Entered an FLSO Docket 03/28/2018

?

hearings, trials, and other judicial proceedings, and at meetings,
as may be required by the Government; and (c) if requested by the
Government, working in an undercover role under the supervision
of, and in compliance with, law enforcement officers and agents.
In addition, the defendant agrees that he will not protect any
person or entity through false information or omission, that he
will not falsely implicate any person or entity, and that he will
not commit any further crimes. The defendant agrees not to reveal
his cooperation, or any information derived therefrom, to any third
party without prior consent of the Government.

- 9. The Government reserves the right to evaluate the nature
and extent of the defendantâs cooperation and to make that
cooperation, or lack thereof, known to the Court at the time of
sentencing. If in the sole and unreviewable judgment of the

Government, the defendantâs cooperation is of such quality and

Significance to the investigation or prosecution of other criminal

matters as to warrant the Courtâs downward departure from the

advisory sentencing range calculated under the Sentencing
Guidelines and/or any applicable minimum mandatory sentence, the
Government may make a motion prior to sentencing pursuant to
Section 5K1l.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines and/or Title 18, United

States Code, Section 3553(e), or subsequent to sentencing pursuant

to Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, informing

the Court that the defendant has provided substantial assistance

and recommending that the defendantâs sentence be reduced. The
defendant understands and agrees, however, that nothing in this
agreement requires the Government to file any such motions, and
that the Governmentâs assessment of the quality and significance
of the defendantâs cooperation shall be binding as it relates to
the appropriateness of the filing or non-filing of a motion to
reduce sentence. In addition, because the defendant agrees that
the Government shall have sole and unreviewable discretion to move
for any sentencing reduction based on his cooperation, the
defendant agrees that he will not seek a variance from the
âguideline range under Title 18, United States Code, Section 3553(a)
because of any cooperation, although the defendant may move for a
variance, if he chooses, because of other grounds, if any, which
do not involve) cooperation.

10. The defendant understands and acknowledges that the
Court is under no obligation to grant a motion for reduction of
sentence filed by the Government. In addition, the defendant
further understands and acknowledges that the Court is under no
obligation of any type to reduce the defendantâs sentence because
of the defendantâs cooperation. |

11. In the event that the defendant chooses to seek a
variance from the sentencing guideline range, the defendant

further agrees that any such application shall be filed in writing

with the Court and served on the United States no later than the

deadline for submitting objections to the Pre-Sentence
Investigation Report stated in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure
32(f) (1).

12. The defendant agrees to forfeit to the United States
voluntarily and immediately all property, real or personal,
involved in the violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section
1956(h) charged in the Information, property traceable to such
property, and/or property that constitutes substitute assets,
pursuant to Title 18, United States Code, Section 982(a)(1) and
Title 21, United States Code, Section 853(p). The defendant
agrees to consent to the entry of orders of forfeiture for such
property and for a money judgment equal in value to the total
amount of property involved in his offense of conviction. The
defendant admits and agrees that the conduct described in the
Information and Factual Proffer provides a sufficient factual and
statutory basis for the forfeiture of the property sought by the
government.

13. The defendant agrees to waive any appeal of the
forfeiture. The defendant waives the requirements of Rules 32.2
and 43(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure regarding
notice of the forfeiture in the Information, announcement of the
forfeiture at sentencing, and incorporation of the forfeiture in
the judgment. The defendant also waives any failure by the Court

to advise the defendant of any applicable forfeiture at the time

the guilty plea is accepted as required by Rule 11(b)(1)(J) of the
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The defendant further agrees
to waive any applicable time limits .for the initiation of
administrative or judicial forfeiture proceedings and/or further
notification of any such forfeiture brought against the property
sought for forfeiture.

14. The defendant also agrees to assist the Government in
all proceedings, administrative or judicial, involving forfeiture
to the United States of any property, including substitute
property, regardless of its nature or form, real or personal, which
the defendant or others known to the defendant, have accumulated
as a result of illegal activities. The defendant agrees that the
United States shall, at its discretion, be entitled to forfeiture
of any property (substitute assets) of the defendant to satisfy
the money judgment. The defendant further agrees that all
elements of Title 21, United States Code, Section 853(p), have
been satisfied. The defendant further agrees to take all steps
necessary to locate property that could be used to satisfy the
forfeiture money judgment and to pass title to the United States
before the defendantâs sentencing. To that end, defendant agrees
to fully assist the Government in the recovery and return to the
United States of any assets, or portions thereof, wherever located.
The assistance shall include: identification of any property

subject to forfeiture, agreement to the entry of an order enjoining

Case Ulf-cr-BO108-CMA Document 1?

the transfer or encumbrance of such property, and the transfer of
such property to the United States by delivery to the Government,
upon the Governmentâs request, any necessary and appropriate
documentation, including consents to forfeiture and quit claim
deeds, to deliver good and marketable title to such property. The
defendant further agrees to liquidate assets, or complete any other
tasks which will result in immediate payment of the forfeiture
money judgment in full, or full payment in the shortest amount of
time, as requested by the Government. Â°

15. The defendant agrees to make full and accurate
disclosure of his financial affairs to the Government and expressly
authorizes the Government to obtain a credit report. The
defendant agrees that within 10 calendar days and upon request of
the Government, the defendant shall submit a completed Financial
Disclosure Statement (form provided by the United States), and
shall fully disclose and identify all assets in which he has any
interest and/or over which the defendant exercises control,
directly or indirectly, including those held by a spouse, nominee,
or other third party. The defendant agrees that providing false
or incomplete information about his financial assets, or hiding,
selling, transferring or devaluing assets and/or failing to
cooperate fully in the investigation and identification of assets
may be used as a basis for: (a) separate prosecution, including,

under Title 18, United States Code, Section 1001; or (b)

recommendation of a denial of a reduction for acceptance of
responsibility pursuant to Sentencing Guidelines Â§ 3E1.1. The
defendant agrees that he will not sell, hide, waste, encumber,
destroy, or otherwise devalue any asset without prior approval of
the Government, until his forfeiture money judgment is paid in
full. The defendant shall also identify any transfer of assets
valued in excess of $5,000 since the date when he became aware of
the criminal investigation, including the identity of the asset,
the value of the asset, the identity of the third party to whom
the asset was transferred, and the current location of the asset.

16. The defendant further understands that forfeiture is
independent of any assessments, fines, costs, restitution, or any
other penalty that may be imposed by the court. The defendant
knowingly and voluntarily waives any claim or defense he may have
under the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution,
including any claim of excessive fine or penalty with respect to
the forfeited property.

17. The defendant is aware that Title 18, United States
Code, Section 3742 and Title 28, United States Code, Section 1291
afford the defendant the right to appeal the sentence imposed in
this case. Acknowledging this, in exchange for the undertakings
made by the United States in this plea agreement, the defendant
hereby waives all rights conferred by Sections 3742 and 1291 to

appeal any sentence imposed, including any restitution order, or

to appeal the manner in which the sentence was imposed, unless the
sentence exceeds the maximum permitted by statute or is the result
of an upward departure and/or an upward variance from the advisory
guideline range that the Court establishes at sentencing. The
defendant further understands that nothing in this agreement shall
affect the Governmentâs right and/or duty to appeal as set forth
in Title 18, United States Code, Section 3742 (b) and Title 28,
United States Code, Section 1291. However, if the United States
appeals the defendantâs sentence pursuant to Sections 3742(b) and-
1291, the defendant shall be released from the above waiver of
appellate rights. In addition to the foregoing provisions, the
defendant hereby waives all rights to argue on appeal that the
statute to which the defendant is pleading guilty is
unconstitutional and that the admitted conduct does not fall within
the scope of the statute. By Signing this agreement, the defendant
acknowledges that the defendant has discussed the appeal waiver
set forth in this agreement with the defendant âs attorney.

18. The defendant is aware that the sentence has not yet
been determined by the Court. The defendant also is aware that

J

any estimate of the probable sentencing range or sentence that the
defendant may receive, whether that estimate comes from the
defendantâs attorney, the Government, or the probation office, is

a prediction, not a promise, and is not binding on the Government,

the probation office, or the Court. The defendant understands

further that any recommendation that the Government makes to the
Court as to sentencing, whether pursuant to this agreement or
otherwise, is not binding on the Court, and the Court may disregard
the recommendation in its entirety. The defendant understands and
acknowledges, as previously acknowledged in paragraph 2 above,
that the defendant may not withdraw his plea based upon the Courtâs
decision not to accept a sentencing recommendation made by the
defendant, the Government, or a recommendation made jointly by
both the defendant and the Government.

19. The defendant recognizes that pleading guilty may have
consequences with respect to the defendantâs immigration status if
the defendant is not a citizen of the United States. Under federal
law, a broad range of crimes are removable offenses, including the
âoffense to which the defendant is pleading guilty. Indeed,
because the defendant is pleading guilty to a conspiracy to launder
money, removal is presumptively mandatory. Removal and other
immigration consequences are the subject of a separate proceeding,
however, and defendant understands that no one, including the
defendantâs attorney or the Court, can predict to a certainty the
effect of the defendantâs conviction on the defendantâs
âimmigration status. Defendant nevertheless affirms that the
defendant wants to plead guilty regardless of any immigration
consequences that the defendantâs plea may entail, even if the

consequence is the defendantâs automatic removal from the United

States.
20. This is the entire agreement and understanding between
the United States and the defendant. There are no other

agreements, promises, representations, or understandings.

Defendants.
THE GRAND JURY CHARGES:
INTRODUCTION

At all times relevant to this Indictment:
Certain Relevant Persons and Entities

1. Rolls-Royce Energy Systems, Inc. (âRRESIâ), was a United States company
headquartered in the Southern District of Ohio, and thus was a âdomestic concernâ within the
meaning of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (âFCPAâ), Title 15, United States Code,
Section 78dd-2. RRESI was an indirect subsidiary of Rolls-Royce plc (âRolls-Royceâ), a
publicly traded company in the United Kingdom, which was a holding company with major
business operations in the civil, aerospace, defense, marine, and energy sectors worldwide.
RRESI produced and supplied compressors and power turbines and provided aftermarket services
for oil and gas and power generation projects in a number of countries worldwide, including

Kazakhstan.
2. Asia Gas Pipeline, LLP (âAGPâ) was a state-owned joint venture between
Kazakhstanâs KazMunayGas and Chinaâs National Petroleum Corporation that was created to
build and connect a gas pipeline between Kazakhstan and China. KazMunayGas was controlled
by Kazakhstan and performed government functions on behalf of Kazakhstan. China National
Petroleum Corporation was controlled by China and performed government functions on behalf of
China. In addition, AGP was controlled by the Kazakh and Chinese governments and performed
government functions for Kazakhstan and China. Thus, KazMunayGas, China National
Petroleum Corporation, and AGP were each an âinstrumentalityâ within the meaning of the FCPA.

3. âTechnical Advisor,â a company whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was
an international engineering and consulting firm with offices worldwide. Technical Advisor
purported to provide independent engineering advice and project management in a number of
business sectors, such as national infrastructure, oil and gas, and energy. Technical Advisor was
retained by AGP to assist it in designing bid specifications and evaluating and awarding bids. In
that capacity, Technical Advisor and its employees assigned to work on AGP projects were acting
in âan official capacity for and on behalf ofâ AGP and its joint venture owners within the meaning
of the FCPA.

4. Defendant PETROS CONTOGURIS, a/k/a PETROS CONTOGURIS-
TROEMEL (âCONTOGURISâ), a Greek national and resident of Istanbul, Turkey, was the
founder and Chief Executive Officer of Gravitas & CIE International Ltd. (âGravitasâ), a Turkey-
based commercial agent and advisor for various oil and gas projects throughout the world.
CONTOGURIS was a commercial agent for RRESI on the Asia Gas Pipeline project in
Kazakhstan. CONTOGURIS was an âagentâ of a domestic concern within the meaning of the

FCPA.
5. Defendant VITALY LESHKOV (âLESHKOVââ) was a Russian national and
employee of the Almaty, Kazakhstan office of Technical Advisor. As an employee of Technical
Advisor assigned to work on the AGP projects, LESHKOV had the ability to exert influence over
decisions at AGP, and he acted in âan official capacity for and on behalf ofâ AGP and its joint
venture owners within the meaning of the FCPA.

6. Defendant AZAT MARTIROSSIAN, a/k/a AZAT MARTIROSYAN
(âMARTIROSSIANâ), was an Armenian national and employee of the Beijing, China office of
Technical Advisor. Before working with Technical Advisor, MARTIROSSIAN formerly was
Armeniaâs ambassador to China. As an employee of Technical Advisor assigned to work on the
AGP projects, MARTIROSSIAN had the ability to exert influence over decisions at AGP, and he
acted in âan official capacity for and on behalf ofâ AGP and its joint venture owners within the
meaning of the FCPA.

7. Louis Zuurhout (âZuurhoutâ) was a Dutch national and an employee of Dutch
subsidiaries of Rolls-Royce with responsibility for selling equipment manufactured or assembled
by RRESI.

8. Keith Barnett (âBarnettâ) was a U.S. national and employee of Rolls-Royce with
responsibility as a sales director for the sales of equipment manufactured and assembled by RRESI.

9. James Finley (âFinleyâ) was a U.K. national and an executive of Rolls-Royce with
responsibility over the Rolls-Royce energy sales division, including the sale of equipment
manufactured and assembled by RRESI and on behalf of Rolls-Royce-affiliated entities in multiple
countries worldwide.

10. Andreas Kohler (âKohlerâ) was an Austrian national and employee of the Munich,

Germany office of Technical Advisor.
11. âForeign Official 1,â an individual whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was
a high-ranking Kazakh official of KazMunayGas, and thus was a âforeign officialâ within the
meaning of the FCPA. As an official of KazMunayGas, Foreign Official 1 had the authority to
exert official influence over purchasing decisions at AGP. CONTOGURIS, LESHKOV,
MARTIROSSIAN, and their co-conspirators often referred to Foreign Official 1 as âFoxâ or
âFuchs.â

12. âForeign Representative,â an individual whose identity is known to the Grand Jury,
was a Kazakh businessman and former Kazakh government official who acted as an agent and
representative for Foreign Official 1âs dealings with CONTOGURIS, Rolls-Royce, RRESI,
Technical Advisor, LESHKOV, and their co-conspirators.

13. âForeign Official 2,â an individual whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was
a high-ranking Chinese official of Petrochina and its subsidiaries, and thus was a âforeign officialâ
within the meaning of the FCPA. As an official of Petrochina and its subsidiaries, Foreign
Official 2 had the authority to exert official influence over purchasing decisions at AGP.

General Allegations

14. RRESI retained CONTOGURIS to pay bribes to various individuals, including
Foreign Official 1, in order to help Rolls-Royce and RRESI secure and maintain contracts with
AGP. After securing the contracts, RRESI paid CONTOGURIS a percentage of the payments it
received from AGP, which CONTOGURIS in turn divided with MARTIROSSIAN and
LESHKOV, with the understanding that a portion of that money would be provided to Foreign
Official 1.

15. Specifically, in or around 2007, Kazakh and Chinese state-owned oil and gas
companies entered into the AGP joint venture agreement to construct a gas pipeline stretching

between Central Asia and China. Rolls-Royce, through RRESI, was among several companies
4
bidding for contracts in the construction of the pipeline beginning in or around 2008. Rolls-Royce
employees, including Zuurhout, Barnett, and Finley, sought a commercial advisor with access to
key decision-makers in Kazakhstan in order to secure some of the contracts that AGP was going
to put out for tender. In particular, they had identified Foreign Official 1 as one of the key
decision-makers and were exploring ways to set up a meeting with Foreign Official 1. In or
around the same time, CONTOGURIS began working with LESHKOV, MARTIROSSIAN,
and Kohler to find a company willing to pay them kickbacks in exchange for them helping that
company win contracts with AGP, including by paying bribes to Foreign Official 1 and others.
16. Rolls-Royce and RRESI, through Zuurhout, Barnett, Finley, and others, began
working toward an agreement with CONTOGURIS, LESHKOV, MARTIROSSIAN, Kohler,
and others, in or around late 2008 when AGP was awarding the first project, Compressor Station
4. RRESI had put in its bid too late to influence the decision, however, and AGP awarded
Compressor Station 4 to RRESIâs main competitor, a U-S.-headquartered multinational company
(âthe Competitorâ), in or around March 2009. The sides still continued to work on coming to an
agreement whereby RRESI would pay CONTOGURIS a commission through his company
Gravitas, which CONTOGURIS, Foreign Official 1, LESHKOV, MARTIROSSIAN, Kohler,
and others, would split. AGP went on to award RRESIa contract for 11 of the 14 units comprising
Compressor Stations 1, 2, 6 and 7 in or around November 2009 for approximately $145 million.
AGP then made payments to RRESI starting in early 2010, and RRESI in turn made commission
payments to Gravitas. CONTOGURIS passed a portion of those commissions onto LESHKOV
and MARTIROSSIAN, knowing that a portion of those commissions would be shared with

Foreign Official 1 consistent with the corrupt agreement.
COUNT ONE
(Conspiracy to Violate the FCPA)

17. Paragraphs 1 through 16 are re-aileged and incorporated by reference as though
fully set forth herein.

18. Beginning at least in or around 2008 and continuing through in or around 2012,
within the Southern District of Ohio and elsewhere, the defendant,

PETROS CONTOGURIS, a/k/a
PETROS CONTOGURIS-TROEMEL,

did knowingly and willfully, that is, with the intent to further the objects of the conspiracy,
combine, conspire, confederate, and agree with others known and unknown, including, among
others, Zuurhout, Barnett, and Finley, to commit offenses against the United States, namely, to
willfully make use of the mails and means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce corruptly
in furtherance of an offer, payment, promise to pay, and authorization of the payment of any
money, offer, gift, promise to give, and authorization of the giving of anything of value, to a foreign
official and to any person, while knowing that all, or a portion of such money and things of value
would be and had been offered, given, and promised to a foreign official, for purposes of (i)
influencing acts and decisions of such foreign official in his or her official capacity; (ii) inducing
such foreign official to do and omit to do acts in violation of the lawful duty of such official; (iti)
securing any improper advantage; and (iv) inducing such foreign official to use his or her influence
with a foreign government and agencies and instrumentalities thereof, to affect and influence acts
and decisions of such government and agencies and instrumentalities, in order to assist RRESI in
obtaining and retaining business for and with, and directing business to, Rolls-Royce, RRESI,

CONTOGURIS, and others, in violation of Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2.
Objects of the Conspiracy

19. A principal purpose and object of the conspiracy was for CONTOGURIS and the
co-conspirators to enrich themselves by paying bribes to foreign officials in order to obtain and
retain business for Rolls-Royce, RRESI, and others, in connection with AGPâs gas pipeline

between Kazakhstan and China.

Manner and Means of the Conspiracy
20. The manner and means by which CONTOGURIS, together with his co-

conspirators and others known and unknown to the Grand Jury, sought to accomplish the object
of the conspiracy included, among other things, the following:

a. CONTOGURIS, Zuurhout, Barnett, Finley, Kohler, LESHKOV,
MARTIROSSIAN, and others, used telephone calls, Short Message Service (âSMSâ) and text
messages, and electronic mail (âe-mailâ), among other means, to discuss bribe payments to foreign
officials, including LESHKOV, MARTIROSSIAN, and Foreign Official 1, in connection with
Rolls-Royce and RRESIâs efforts to win business with AGP.

b. CONTOGURIS, Zuurhout, Barnett, Finley, Kohler, LESHKOV,
MARTIROSSIAN, and others, traveled to and from the United States and several other countries
to meet in person and arrange for bribe payments to be made to foreign officials, including
LESHKOV, MARTIROSSIAN, and Foreign Official 1, in order to assist Rolls-Royce and
RRESI in winning business with AGP.

@ CONTOGURIS, Zuurhout, Barnett, Finley, Kohler, LESHKOV,
MARTIROSSIAN, and others, arranged meetings with Foreign Official 1 and Foreign Official 2
in order to solidify their influence in support of Rolls-Royce and RRESIâs attempts to obtain and

retain business from AGP.
d. CONTOGURIS, Zuurhout, Barnett, Finley, Kohler, LESHKOV,
MARTIROSSIAN, and others, caused Rolls-Royce and RRESI to enter into an advisor agreement
with Gravitas, through which Rolls-Royce and RRESI paid commissions to Gravitas, which
included bribes bound for foreign officials, including LESHKOV, MARTIROSSIAN, and
Foreign Official 1.

e. CONTOGURIS, Zuurhout, Barnett, Finley, Kohler, LESHKOV,
MARTIROSSIAN, and others, took various surreptitious steps to promote and conceal the bribery
scheme, including by (i) using code names, such as âFoxâ and âFuchs,â to refer to Foreign Official
1, and (ii) concealing the bribe payments to Foreign Official 1 within RRESIâs commission
payments to Gravitas.

f. CONTOGURIS, Zuurhout, Barnett, Finley, Kohler, LESHKOV,
MARTIROSSIAN, and others, transferred and caused to be transferred funds, including bribe
payments, to and from bank accounts in the United States, Kazakhstan, the United Kingdom, the
Bahamas, Singapore, Hong Kong, Switzerland, and elsewhere, to promote and conceal the bribery
scheme.

g. CONTOGURIS, Zuurhout, Barnett, Finley, Kohler, LESHKOV,
MARTIROSSIAN, and others, discussed and disseminated confidential and internal AGP and
Technical Advisor documents and information to help Rolls-Royce and RRESI win business with
AGP.

h. CONTOGURIS, Zuurhout, Barnett, Finley, Kohler, LESHKOV,
MARTIROSSIAN, and others, used invoices in an attempt to provide the appearance of

legitimacy to the commission payments and fund transfers.
Overt Acts

21. In furtherance of the conspiracy and to achieve the objects thereof, at least one of
the co-conspirators committed, or caused to be committed, in the Southern District of Ohio and
elsewhere, at least one of the following overt acts, among others:

22. On or about September 25, 2008, CONTOGURIS, Foreign Representative, and
Zuurhout met in Moscow, Russia to discuss the ways in which CONTOGURIS and Foreign
Representative could assist Rolls-Royce in winning business from AGP.

23. On or about September 27, 2008, RRESI submitted a bid to AGP for Compressor
Station 4.

24. On or about October 30, 2008, CONTOGURIS and Finley flew to Kazakhstan,
where they met with Foreign Official 1 and Foreign Representative.

25. On or about November 5, 2008, LESHKOV e-mailed CONTOGURIS about
Foreign Official 1âs availability to meet with Finley in London. LESHKOV wrote that Foreign
Official 1, to whom he referred as âMr. Fox,â âadvised not to worry for the tender,â and that âthe
meeting in London will be an important oneâ and CONTOGURIS should âplease keep warm
RR.â

26. On or about November 27, 2008, Finley met with Foreign Official 2 and
MARTIROSSIAN in China and discussed potential business opportunities for Rolls-Royce with
AGP, including supplying the gas turbine compressor packages for Compressor Station 4.

27. On or about December 3, 2008, CONTOGURIS flew to London, England, where
he met with Finley, Kohler, Foreign Representative and Foreign Official 1.

28. | Onor about December 4, 2008, CONTOGURIS e-mailed Finley, copying Kohler,

and recounting the December 3, 2008 meeting, stating:
[Kohler] and I sincerely hope that all of your concerns were laid to rest during the meeting
with Mr. Fox. He has clearly taken a position and confirmed that [Foreign
Representative] is designated as a welcome and reliable local partner. . . . You also saw
how respectful [Foreign Representative] behaved vis-a-vis Mr. Fox. Everything is
marching in the right direction.

Mr. Fox authorized [Kohler] to let you benefit from receiving information when and if it

is being produced in order to give you more time to prepare. This is also an indication

that he wanted you to know that he is the âMaster of the gameâ.

29. On or about December 12, 2008, CONTOGURIS e-mailed Zuurhout and Finley a
copy of an internal AGP evaluation of the Competitorâs bid for Compressor Station 4.
CONTOGURIS wrote: âJob has not been awarded. Best tactic to follow is to let me know what
we offer in terms of short and medium/long term remuneration scheme. Will process this through
[Foreign Representative] and hope to turn it around. [MARTIROSSIAN] says Chinese have no
objection. Please do not make available to anyone else but addresses.â

30. On or about December 27, 2008, Finley e-mailed CONTOGURIS a proposed
engagement letter between Rolls-Royce and Gravitas for the AGP project that provided for
Gravitas to be paid a 2% commission on new equipment for the compressor stations on the pipeline
and a 6% commission for aftermarket sales.

31. On or about December 27, 2008, CONTOGURIS replied to Finleyâs e-mail
referenced in Paragraph 30 above, stating: â[LESHKOV] told me yesterday that [Foreign
Representative] would like to meet in Zurich . . . and take it to the next level.â

32. On or about December 27, 2008, CONTOGURIS forwarded to LESHKOV and
Kohler the Rolls-Royce engagement letter from Finley and added a recap of where things stood,
writing: âWe met with Mr. Fox and [Foreign Representative] on June 28th . . . and agreed on the
basic principle of cooperation. On the 29th of August we had the unsuccessful meeting with [the

Competitor] and commenced the canvassing of RR.â In the e-mail, CONTOGURIS also listed

the meetings with Zuurhout, Barnett, and Finley over the previous few months, as well as âdozens

10
of e-mail exchanges and telephone calls,â before noting: âWe are four partners,
[MARTIROSSIAN], [LESHKOV], [Kohler] and the undersigned.â

33. On or about January 11, 2009, CONTOGURIS e-mailed LESHKOV and Kohler,
and addressing LESHKOV, wrote:

It may be stated without any doubt that without the joint efforts of [Kohler], [LESHKOV]

and the undersigned (augmented by the valiant efforts of our friend and partner in Peking,

[MARTIROSSIAN]) the Kazakh Group led by [Foreign Representative] would not have

been able to proceed to the status quo we have managed to be elevated to. . . . The âsecretâ

weapon without much doubt, is the responsible role that the [Technical Advisor] is
requested to assist [AGP] with the adjudication process. . . . I will do my best to bring

[Zuurhout] and [Barnett] to the state-of-mind that will predicate our presence. . . . [YJour

contribution is to keep Fox in-line with the decision making process, however [Kohler]

needs to head our efforts to negotiate a workable and therefore profitable deal for us.

34. On or about January 15, 2009, Zuurhout, Barnett, and CONTOGURIS met with
Foreign Representative and his Swiss lawyers in Zurich, Switzerland. At the meeting, Foreign
Representative explained that Rolls-Royceâs proposed bribe of 2% of the price for new equipment
sales that Rolls-Royce received was not acceptable. Foreign Representative instead demanded a
bribe of 10% of the new equipment sales and threatened that Rolls-Royce would not win any
business if it did not agree.

35. On or about January 19, 2009, LESHIKOV e-mailed Kohler to update him on the
Zurich meeting and wrote: âThe main purpose was to find a deal for the future RR activity in Kz
and upcoming tender for CS 4. . RR informed they have no objection to a deal, but they need
a clear source and company to deal via.â

36. On or about January 19, 2009, CONTOGURIS e-mailed Zuurhout: âPlease let me
know whether or not I should try to utilize the forces of my friend and partner,
[MARTIROSSIAN], to impress upon [the Chinese side of AGP], to consider y(our) offer rather

than the one of [the Competitor].â

11
37. On or about January 19, 2009, Zuurhout replied to the e-mail referenced in
Paragraph 36 above, stating: âGive it a go.â

38.  Onor about January 20, 2009, Zuurhout e-mailed Barnett and Finley to report that
he had a phone call with Kohler and CONTOGURIS, and â[LESHKOV] is to meet mr fox either
tomorrow or friday. He needs input on how far rr is willing to go. As discussed with [Barnett]
last week this need[s] to come from reallicating [sic] the percentages. After that [Finley] [w]ill
need to meet mr fox to confirm this number on very short notice.â

39. On or about January 26, 2009, CONTOGURIS sent an e-mail to Zuurhout,
Barnett, and Finley, and wrote that in his âpersistent effort to render every kind of conceivable
effort and endeavor to assist RR energy to be awarded the CS 4 and/or other contracts,â he was
attaching internal AGP documents, which he summarized as demonstrating the Chinese side of
AGPâs preferences for certain turbine specifications that could favor the Competitor.
CONTOGURIS also proposed that Finley âauthorize [MARTIROSSIAN] to immediately
mobilize his considerable resources that Chinese authorities insist vis-4-vis Kazakh to also
consider RR offer in their comparison.â

40. On or about January 26, 2009, CONTOGURIS forwarded to MARTIROSSIAN
the e-mail referenced in Paragraph 39 above, and asked MARTIROSSIAN to confirm that he
received it.

41. On or about January 26, 2009, MARTIROSSIAN replied to the e-mail referenced
in Paragraph 40 above, stating, âYes I received.â

42. Â° On or about January 26, 2009, Zuurhout replied to CONTOGURISâs e-mail
referenced in Paragraph 39 above: âAs discussed earlier today we need all the support to turn
Kazakhstan into our favor. Please ask you[r] friend [MARTIROSSIAN] to work from his angle.

... ] look forward to discuss [sic] our proposal . . . on the alternative solution to CS4.â

12
43. On or about January 26, 2009, CONTOGURIS forwarded Zuurhoutâs reply in
Paragraph 42 to MARTIROSSIAN, copied Kohler, and wrote: â[MARTIROSSIAN], Please
read his answer, this is their clear authority to us . . . to proceed to try our utmost to save this CS 4
project. If you manage this with your top echelon contact, I am telling you and [Kohler] that they
(RR) would even ask us if we could save their Chinese project. . . .â

44, On or about January 26, 2009, Kohler e-mailed MARTIROSSIAN: âDear
[MARTIROSSIAN], please do your utmost that [the Chinese partner at AGP] will consider RRâs
proposal and start negotiations with them soonest. Copy of the RR bid will be submitted to you
immediately.â

45. On or about January 26, 2009, CONTOGURIS forwarded to MARTIROSSIAN
and Kohler an e-mail Zuurhout sent to CONTOGURIS about TRACE approval for Gravitas.
CONTOGURIS wrote: âDear [MARTIROSSIAN], . . . Once they send this conditions, they have
already âcrossedâ this line, i.e. they have internally decided to indeed work with us. Please note
that this is their âendorsementâ of [Kohler], Azat [|MARTIROSSIAN], Petros [CONTOGURIS],
Vitaly [LESHKOV].â

46. On or about January 26, 2009, MARTIROSSIAN responded to the e-mail
referenced in Paragraph 45 above, stating that he would keep in âclose contactâ with the Chinese
side of the AGP joint venture and that: âI am not for sure station No4 but I think it will be possible
involve Rols Roys [sic] in future. 1âll use also possibilities during Chinese New Year meetings
but the real work can be done after New Year holidays.â

47. On or about January 26, 2009, CONTOGURIS forwarded to MARTIROSSIAN
and Kohler another e-mail exchange between CONTOGURIS and Zuurhout, and added to the
subject line âURGENT PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL - 4 YOUR EYES ONLY.â

CONTOGURIS wrote that Zuurhout was trying to âinduce [Finley] to meet with Foxâ and
13
estimated that MARTIROSSIANâs âprovident access to top echelon decision makers in PROC,â
when âcombinedâ with âFoxâ would allow Rolls-Royce to get its âfoot into the door.â
CONTOGURIS wrote to them that âafter speaking to [MARTIROSSIAN] tonight and listening
carefully to him and to what he had to say, I could detect that he still has not lost all of his hope to
promote the CS 4[.]â

48, On or about January 29, 2009, Zuurhout e-mailed CONTOGURIS Rolls-Royceâs
proposed scope of supply for CS4 and wrote: â[the Chinese] should have the full proposal. . . .
Why donât you have MARTIROSSIAN use the PMC report... . Whom is he contacting [with the
Chinese]?â

49. On or about January 29, 2009, CONTOGURIS forwarded to MARTIROSSIAN
and Kohler the e-mail referenced in Paragraph 48 above.

50. On or about February 6, 2009, CONTOGURIS met with Zuurhout and Barnett in
London, where they informed CONTOGURIS that, based on the prior meeting in Zurich, they
would not move forward with CONTOGURIS as an advisor on the AGP bids if Foreign
Representative continued to be involved.

51. | Onor about February 24, 2009, CONTOGURIS and Kohler had a conference call
with Zuurhout and Barnett, in which they agreed that Rolls-Royce would continue to work with
CONTOGURIS on RRESIâs AGP bids without Foreign Representative.

52. On or about February 28, 2009, CONTOGURIS e-mailed LESHKOV, writing
that âthe offensive behavior of [Foreign Representative] has led RR to not want to collaborate with
him.â CONTOGURIS then proposed a way forward:

Ihave suggested you [LESHKOV] to be the official RR man on the ground in Kazkahstan

[sic], in whatever function. ... GM or Chief Advisor Kazakhstan or whatever... . You

secure the collaboration of your friend [Foreign Official 1]. Iam going to instal [sic] an
absolutely satisfactory system how future revenues are going to be distributed.

14
CONTOGURIS, switching to the third person, then wrote: âWe shall distribute 60% to your
friend and 10% each to our partner in China [MARTIROSSIAN], our partner in Kazakhstan
[LESHKOV)], our partner in Austria [Kohler] and our partner in Turkey [CONTOGURIS].â
CONTOGURIS also proposed paying Foreign Official 1 his split of the Gravitas commission
from Rolls-Royce through LESHKOV via a Singaporean shell company.

53. On or about March 5, 2009, LESHKOV responded to CONTOGURIS: âTI [met]
Mr. Fox and we also discussed RR issue. He agreed and has nothing against that I will be in
charge for dealing with RR. The scheme as in your e-mail might be implemented.â

54, On or about March 20, 2009, AGP awarded the contract for Compressor Station 4
to the Competitor.

55. On or about April 5, 2009, MARTIROSSIAN e-mailed CONTOGURIS and
Kohler, advising that a Chinese official would âensureâ Rolls-Royceâs invitation and qualification
for the AGP contract tenders by sending an e-mail on their behalf to the leader of the Chinese side
of the AGP joint venture. MARTIROSSIAN also advised that the Chinese official would keep
in close contact with MARTIROSSIAN âabout [the] situation for RR.â

56. On or about April 5, 2009, CONTOGURIS forwarded to Zuurhout, Barnett, and
Finley the e-mail referenced in Paragraph 55 above.

57. On or about May, 8, 2009, RRESI submitted its bid to supply AGP with 14 gas
turbine compressor packages for Compressor Stations 1, 2, 6, and 7.

58. On or about May 8, 2009, after Zuurhout, Barnett, Finley, and others at RRESI
realized that its margins were going to be much lower than it had first anticipated, Finley e-mailed
CONTOGURIS a new commission agreement which provided for a Gravitas commission reduced
from 2% to 1.5% on new equipment for the compressor stations on the pipeline and reduced from

6% to 3% for aftermarket sales.

15
59. On or about May 9, 2009, CONTOGURIS forwarded Finleyâs e-mail to
LESHKOV and wrote: âRR have told me that this is the absolute maximum they can afford in
their calculation, whilst still remaining competitive. [LESHKOV] please be so kind and speak
to your people and obtain their concurrence that this agreement should be countersigned and
entered into.â

60. Onor about May 12, 2009, LESHKOV replied to the e-mail from CONTOGURIS
referenced in Paragraph 59 above, stating: âI should have a private meeting with Mr. Fox in several
days. ... Meanwhile could you please advise â if I indicate 1,5% and then 3% and it [g]oes all to
Fox&company where is our interest to be ingaged [sic] in the process?â

61. On or about May 12, 2009, CONTOGURIS responded to the e-mail from
LESHKOV referenced in Paragraph 60 above, stating: âBottom line is that I do not know how
to answer your question. We have what we have and Fox has to at least share 2/3 1/3, we
definitely do not want the business otherwise. . . .[I]f Fox is not agreeable to support the RR fully
as and [sic] what we have on the table today, I will cancel the arrangement and tell them to go
ahead without our support.â

62. On or about June 6, 2009, LESHKOV e-mailed CONTOGURIS after
LESHKOV met with âFox,â and wrote:

Summary: R is very competitive from all points of view (technical and price). To

negotiate the relations with R, at this point he indicated that 1,5 and 3 is not acceptable and

proposed 3,5 and 3,5. But I clearly understood it is negotiable (I mean it should be a room

for us, otherwise bringing the Client and working with him for a year for free itâs a

nonsense). . . . I believe at least 0,5 should be reserved for us. . . .

63. On or about June 12, 2009, CONTOGURIS sent an e-mail to LESHKOV with
the subject line âour friends in London,â explaining that CONTOGURIS tried to push Rolls-

Royce to increase the Gravitas commission but it would not go further and was âprepared to walk

away from the transaction completely.â CONTOGURIS noted: âThe corporate governance
16
processes of this listed company is formidable, there are forty employees in a division that is
specifically designed to avoid exactly this what your friend wants to do now.â

64. On or about June 18, 2009, LESHKOV responded to the e-mail from
CONTOGURIS referenced in Paragraph 63 above, stating, âMr. Fox [wa]s getting angry,â that
the âproposed 3,5 [wa]s already the lowest ever on the market,â and that â[t]he arguments â âlisted
companyâ or âcorporate governance processâ they can leave for mass mediaâ because other âeven
bigger caliberâ companies were always able to find a âcompromise.â

65. On or about June 21, 2009, CONTOGURIS e-mailed LESHKOV and Kohler and
stated: âTell Mr. Fuchs to proceed as is and we will cede 75% of the current agreement to your
Singapore company. That means that you will receive 1.833.750,-USD at this stage and we will
be satisfied with 611.000,-USD.... As it is there are 6.7 Million lying on the table for Fuchs and
1.8 Million for us from phases 1 +2.â CONTOGURIS added: âThis is a listed company
operating in a country where anti-corruption laws are the strictest in Europe. If it had not been
for my 8 Billion USD track record and my business acumen shown, at least [Kohler] knows that,
there would not be a deal on the table.â

66. On or about July 12, 2009, CONTOGURIS e-mailed MARTIROSSIAN, and
copied Kohler, following a phone call between MARTEROSSIAN and CONTOGURIS.
CONTOGURIS, addressing MARTIROSSIAN as âBro Azat,â wrote that he agreed that the
âKazakhsâ should not be able to âget rewardedâ if they did not help, or worked against, Rolls-
Royce and that it would be âbetter to cancel the contract with RR and more honorable from our
side to do so, which is the ONLY way to remain truthful to our word to RR, whom we promised
our support.â CONTOGURIS then addressed Kohler, adding: âit is your obligation to now speak
to Mr. Fox and bring clarity into this. Without [MARTIROSSIAN]âs efforts the PROC side

would not have pronounced RR as the desired âwinnerâ. We know that [Foreign Official 2] went
17
to Kazakhstan to participate in the shareholders meeting of the JV, just for the purpose of
upholding the agreement with you bro Azat [MARTIROSSIAN]. Contoguris closed by stating
that he would âleave it to your wisdom [MARTIROSSIAN] and to [Kohlerâs] knowledge and
intuition, how to manage this matter in a judicious and transparent way vis-a-vis RR.â

67. On or about August 3, 2009, Barnett and Finley traveled to Astana, Kazakhstan and.
met with LESHKOV, where they discussed RRESIâs bid and prepared for AGPâs upcoming bid
clarification meetings.

68. On or about August 4, 2009, CONTOGURIS sent an e-mail to Finley, copying
Kohler, in which CONTOGURIS advised that he had learned that RRESIâs bid had a potential
technical deficiency in the proposed emissions efficiency and that one way to address it involved
going âthrough [MARTIROSSIAN]âs Chinese support structureâ where MARTIROSSIAN had
âunimaginable waysâ of âreachingâ into the Chinese government.

69. On or about August 10, 2009, LESHKOV e-mailed Finley: âI have discussed with
Fox the issue. Diplomatically he answered support will be provided, but now also a lot depends
on your technical clarification.â

70. On or about August 13, 2009, Barnett and Finley visited CONTOGURIS at his
home in Istanbul, Turkey and confirmed that they would increase the commission percentage
RRESI would pay to Gravitas for new equipment by .75% (for a total of 2.25%) if RRESI won all
14 turbines that were up for bid (for Compressor Stations 1, 2, 6 and 7), and .25% (for a total of
1.75%) if it won fewer than all 14.

71. On or about August 14, 2009, MARTIROSSIAN e-mailed CONTOGURIS and
relayed that he had learned that âChinese preferable option is: CS No-1 for [the Competitor] (from

supply schedule reason and âif Kazakh side can keep a faceâ). Other 3 station for RR... .â

18
72. On or about August 14, 2009, CONTOGURIS e-mailed LESHKOV and Kohler,
summarizing the split between Foreign Official 1 and LESHKOV, Kohler, MARTIROSSIAN,
and CONTOGURIS: âThat means the final picture is the following: In case all 14 machines are
awarded the Foxtrott Co will receive 1.50%, the balance will go to the âQuatrumphirateâ. In case
less than 14 machines, the 1.25% will go to Foxtrott Co and the balance will go to
âQuatrumphirate.â.â

73. On or about August 15, 2009, LESHKOV replied to the e-mail from
CONTOGURIS referenced in Paragraph 72 above, stating: âI made my best recently to sort out
at least our position towards [Finley] and lialize [sic] with Fox.â LESHKOV explained that
âTw]hat [wa]s more difficult was to influence [sic] [Technical Advisorâs] engineers!â

TA. On or about August 28, 2009, after individuals within the Kazakh side of AGP
circulated an internal memorandum deeming RRESIâs bid âtechnically unacceptableâ and
recommending disqualification, Kohler attached the memorandum to an email to
MARTIROSSIAN, and copied CONTOGURIS. Kohler noted that, âthe Kazakhs have used the
weak points of RR and calculated very high financial losses,â and asked MARTIROSSIAN,
âHow is the situation now?â

75. On or about August 28, 2009, CONTOGURIS forwarded to Finley the e-mail
referenced in Paragraph 74 above and wrote that MARTIROSSIAN was âreporting from Pekingâ
that a Chinese foreign official told him that nothing was decided yet and that they were âtrying
[their] best to increase the leverage from Chinese side, to stop the bloody Kazak [sic].â

76. On or about August 30, 2009, LESHKOV met with Foreign Official 1 to discuss
AGPâs internal recommendation to disqualify RRESI.

77. On or about September 6, 2009, Finley sent an SMS or âtext messageâ to

LESHKOV saying âthe deal with fox is cancelled.â
19
78. On or about September 7, 2009, LESHKOV e-mailed Finley, copied Barnett and
CONTOGURIS, and explained that Foreign Official 1 had âinitiated an internal investigationâ
into the memorandum disqualifying RRESI while Technical Advisor had refused to endorse it.
LESHKOV explained that â[b]ecause of Fox and our company position (plus to certain extend
[sic] Chinese position) [the disqualification] decision is blocked.â Referring to Finleyâs SMS,
LESHKOV then wrote âIâm stick [sic] to . . . agreements reached, unless they are cancelled. I
feel regret now to be involved in all this discussions (which, as gentlemen, we should keep
absolutely in high confidentiality). Also my reputation (in front of Fox, for example) can be
harmed.... Ikindly ask you asap to confirm/or not your sms.â

79. On or about September 11, 2009, CONTOGURIS e-mailed Barnett and Finley,
attaching a confidential written report from Technical Advisor setting out arguments for why the
internal memorandum disqualifying RRESI was incorrect and proclaiming that RRESIâs bid was
acceptable. In the e-mail, CONTOGURIS wrote: âI sincerely hope that your previously
mentioned grievances have been put to rest... . I am sure you can âuseâ this adequately. If you
cannot provide access of this document to your Chinese friends, please let me know and I will
inform [MARTIROSSIAN] to hand it over officially.â

80. On or about November 22, 2009, AGP awarded RRESI a contract to supply 11 of
the 14 gas turbine compressor packages for approximately $145 million.

81. Approximately three days later, on or about November 25, 2009, Gravitas and
RRESI executed a written advisor agreement.

82. On or about the following dates, CONTOGURIS, Zuurhout, Barnett, Finley,
Kohler, LESHKOV, MARTIROSSIAN, and others, caused AGP to make the following corrupt
payments from AGPâs bank accounts in Kazakhstan to bank accounts belonging to RRESI in

84. In or around February 2010, CONTOGURIS lobbied Finley for a 2.25%
commission (which they had agreed would only be paid had RRESI won 14 units) even though
RRESI won fewer than the 14 total units up for bid.

85. On or about February 27, 2010, after Finley refused to pay more than the agreed
upon 1.75%, CONTOGURIS sent Finley an SMS: âVery sad that after positioning RR with a lot
of patience and continuous follow-up from my side, that you have not seen it necessary to
personally attend to outstanding matters, which is necessary.â

86. | Onor about February 27, 2010, CONTOGURIS forwarded the SMS referenced in
Paragraph 85 above as an e-mail to Kohler and wrote: âTell Fuchs no dice from RR.â

87. In or around August 2010, after negotiations, LESHKOV told CONTOGURIS
and Kohler that Foreign Official 1 would agree to accept a lump sum of $500,000 USD from
CONTOGURIS as the payment for the RRESI award rather than wait until CONTOGURIS
received all of the commission payments from RRESI.

88. On or about September 19, 2010, LESHKOV sent an e-mail to CONTOGURIS
and Kohler, in which he attached a document with details for his Singaporean shell corporation

and wrote: âKindly asking you to proceed.â

22
89. On or about February 14, 2011, CONTOGURIS made the first of approximately
six transfers of the commissions RRESI paid to Gravitas from the U.K. bank account to accounts
in the Bahamas and Switzerland.

90. On or about February 14, 2011, LESHKOVâs accountant sent LESHKOV five
false invoices from MARTIROSSIAN to LESHKOVâs Singaporean shell corporation for
purported work done on a âbusiness development project in China carried out in 2008,â before

a subject of âFinal payment of personal debts,â and wrote: âI finally managed to make the transfer
yesterday and have finally been able to settle all the loans extended to me. . . as agreed, total sum
500K.â

93. On or about March 9, 2012, approximately one day after RRESI paid its last

94, On or about April 11, 2012, MARTIROSSIAN e-mailed CONTOGURIS two
invoices, both dated March 30, 2012, each in the amount of $25,000. The invoices requested

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Thursday, May 24, 2018

Former Armenian Ambassador and a Russian National Charged in Foreign Bribery and Money
Laundering Scheme

Two employees of an international engineering consulting firm were charged in a superseding indictment filed today for their alleged
participation in a scheme to launder bribe payments to foreign government officials for the benefit of a Columbus, Ohio-based subsidiary of
Rolls-Royce plc, to secure a contract to supply equipment and services to power a gas pipeline from Kazakhstan to China.

Acting Assistant Attorney General John P. Cronan of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Benjamin C. Glassman of the
Southern District of Ohio, Acting Inspector in Charge Nicole Davis of the U.S. Postal Inspection Serviceâs Criminal Investigations Group, Assistant
Director Christopher Hacker of the FBIâs Criminal Investigative Division and Special Agent in Charge Matthew J. DeSarno of the FBIâs Washington
Field Office Criminal Division made the announcement.

Azat Martirossian, 62, a citizen of Armenia, and Vitaly Leshkov, 50, a citizen of Russia, were charged by a superseding indictment filed in the
Southern District of Ohio with one count of conspiracy to launder money and 10 counts of money laundering. Petros Contoguris, 70, a citizen of
Greece, was also charged on these counts, as well as one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), and seven
counts of violating the FCPA. Contoguris previously had been charged on all of these counts in an indictment that was filed on Oct. 12, 2017
and unsealed on Nov. 7, 2017. Martirossian, Leshkov, and Contoguris are believed to be residing outside the United States.

âThe charges announced today against Azat Martirossian and Vitaly Leshkov further demonstrate the Criminal Divisionâs unwavering resolve to
prosecute those who facilitate corruption and launder illicit proceeds,â said Acting Assistant Attorney General Cronan. âThanks to the
coordinated efforts by our prosecutors and agentsâworking closely with their counterparts throughout the worldâthese defendants will face
prosecution for their allegedly corrupt schemes.â

âThe charges filed today reflect the continued determination of the United States to prosecute those who engage in foreign corrupt business
practices,â said U.S. Attorney Glassman. âInternational actors should think twice before executing bribery schemes because the United States
can and will discover and prosecute such schemes and their perpetrators.â

âThe U.S. Postal Inspection Service has a long history of successfully investigating complex fraud and corruption cases,â said Acting Inspector in
Charge Davis. âCorruption and bribery schemes such as this involving international corporations and conspirators are not victimless crimes.
This type of conduct can damage competitive domestic and international markets, and cause immeasurable economic losses both here in the
United States and around the world. Anyone who engages in deceptive practices like this should know they will not go undetected and will be
held accountable, regardless of where they are. The collaborative investigative work on this case conducted by Postal Inspectors and our
domestic and international law enforcement partners illustrates our efforts to protect the United States and the international marketplace.â

âThe allegations outlined today exemplify how a small group of individuals, who knowingly engage in illegal payments in an attempt to advance
businesses dealings, create an uneven global marketplace,â said Acting Assistant Director Hacker. âThe FBI with our partners continues to work
these important cases in order to remove the notion that bribery, through backroom deals, is an acceptable way of doing business. This
investigation demonstrates the importance of international cooperation amongst law enforcement in combatting fraud and money laundering
ona global basis.â

âTodayâs charges serve as a reminder of the important role the FBI plays in rooting out international corruption,â said FBI Special Agent in
Charge DeSarno. âNo one is above the law, so let todayâs announcement be a warning to those who may try to perpetrate a similar scheme
that the FBI will work with global partners in its mission to detect and prevent corrupt business practices, and we will continue to hold those who
attempt to take advantage of international markets accountable.â

According to the superseding indictment, Contoguris, the founder and chief executive officer of Gravitas & CIE. International Ltd. (Gravitas),
former Rolls-Royce employees and executives, and others, allegedly conspired to pay bribes to foreign officials in exchange for directing
business to Rolls-Royce Energy Systems Inc. (RRESI). RRESI was a U.S.-based subsidiary of Rolls-Royce plc, the United Kingdom-based global
manufacturer and distributor of power systems for the aerospace, defense, marine and energy sectors.

The superseding indictment alleges that Contoguris, working with employees of an international engineering consulting firm (Technical Advisor),
including Martirossian and Leshkov, devised and executed a scheme with Rolls-Royce executives and employees, whereby Rolls-Royce would
pay kickbacks to the Technical Advisor employees and bribes to at least one foreign official in Kazakhstan, and disguise these payments as
commissions to Contogurisâs company, Gravitas, in exchange for helping Rolls-Royce win contracts with Asia Gas Pipeline LLP (AGP).

According to the superseding indictment, AGP was created to build and connect a gas pipeline between Central Asia and China, and the
Technical Advisor purported to provide independent engineering consulting advice and other services to AGP. The superseding indictment
further alleges that after AGP awarded Rolls-Royce a contract in November 2009, worth approximately $145 million, Rolls-Royce made
commission payments to Gravitas, and Contoguris then passed a portion of those commission payments onto the Technical Advisor employees,
including Leshkov and Martirossian, knowing that a portion of that money would be shared with a foreign official consistent with their corrupt
agreement.

The charges announced today follow the Jan. 17, 2017 announcement of a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with Rolls-Royce plc and a
more than $800 million total penalty as part of a global resolution to investigations by the Department of Justice, U.K., and Brazilian authorities
related to the corrupt conduct. The charges also follow upon the Nov. 7, 2017 announcement, concerning Rolls-Royce former executives and
employees James Finley, Keith Barnett and Louis Zuurhout, and Technical Advisor employee Andreas Kohler, each of whom have entered guilty
pleas in connection with their respective roles in the bribery scheme. The DPA acknowledged Rolls-Royceâs cooperation in this case, including
with the Departmentâs investigation into individuals, and significant remedial measures.

An indictment is merely an allegation and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of
law.

The U.S. Postal Inspection Service and the FBI's International Corruption Squad in Washington, D.C., investigated the case. Trial Attorneys Kevin
R. Gingras and Vanessa Snyder of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys J. Michael Marous and Jessica Kim of the
Southern District of Ohio are prosecuting the case.

The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs provided significant assistance in this matter. The United Kingdomâs Serious Fraud Office
provided assistance in this matter, as did law enforcement colleagues in Brazil, which both coordinated with the Department to reach
simultaneous resolutions with Rolls-Royce. The Department also thanks its law enforcement colleagues in Austria, the Bahamas, Germany, the
Netherlands, Singapore, Switzerland and Turkey.

The Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice
Department's FCPA enforcement efforts can be found at www. justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.

MALCOLM HARRIS, 7 E CR 3 eS iH â

Defendants.
=e Sekt St A ote =afcacke* o's
Overview
1,4 From in or about March 2013 through in or about
May 2015, JOO HYUN BAHN, a/k/a âDennis Bahnâ (âJOO HYUN BAHNâ or
âBAHNâ), the defendant, and his father, BAN KI SANG (""BAN KI
SANGâ or âBAN""â), the defendant, engaged in an international

conspiracy to bribe a foreign official (âForeign Official-1â) of
a country in the Middle East (*Country-1"") in connection with
the attempted $800 million sale of a building complex in Vietnam
known as Landmark 72.

2, At all times relevant to the Indictment, Keangnam
Enterprises Co., Ltd. (âKeangnamâ) was a South Korean
construction company that built and owned Landmark 72, and BAN
KI SANG, the defendant, was a senior executive at Keangnam. In
2013 Keangnam was experiencing a liquidity crisis. The debts

owed to Keangnamâs creditors were maturing and the company
needed to raise capital. Keangnam turned to JOO HYUN BAHN,
a/k/a âDennis Bahn,â the defendant, who was a commercial real
estate broker in Manhattan, to secure an investor for Landmark
72. If BAHN were successful, he stood to earn a commission of
at least five million dollars.

3, Instead of obtaining financing through legitimate
channels, JOO HYUN BAHN and BAN KI SANG, the defendants, engaged
ina corrupt scheme to pay bribes to Foreign Official-1, through
MALCOLM HARRIS, the defendant, who held himself out as an agent
of Foreign Official-1, to induce Foreign Official-1 to use his
influence to convince Country-1âs sovereign wealth fund (the
âFundâ) to acquire Landmark 72. In or about April 2014, based
on communications with HARRIS, BAHN and BAN agreed to pay,
through HARRIS, a $500,000 upfront bribe and a $2,000,000 bribe
upon the close of the sale of Landmark 72 to Foreign Official-1
on behalf of Keangnam. Unbeknownst to BAHN or BAN, however,
HARRIS did not have the claimed relationship with Foreign
Official-1 and did not intend to pay the bribe money to Foreign
Official-1. Instead, HARRIS simply stole the $500,000 upfront
bribe paid by BAHN and BAN, which HARRIS then spent on lavish
personal expenses.

4, Over the next year, as the Landmark 72 deal
showed no signs of actual progress, Keangnamâs liquidity crisis

worsened. Believing that the upfront bribe that JOO HYUN BAHN, |

2
the defendant, had paid would eventually bear fruit and not
wanting to lose a potential multi-million-dollar commission,
BAHN engaged in a fraudulent scheme to trick Keangnam and its
creditors into believing the Fund was close to acquiring
Landmark 72. In furtherance of this scheme, BAHN repeatedly
lied to Keangnam and its creditors about the status of the deal,
knowing that Keangnam and its creditors would rely upon the
misrepresentations. BAHN forged emails from Foreign Official-1
and other documents to make the sale of Landmark 72 appear
imminent. Ultimately, when the deal with the Fund failed to
materialize, Keangnam was forced to enter court receivership in
south Korea.

Relevant Persons and Entities

 

5. At all times relevant to this Indictment, JOO
HYUN BAHN, the defendant, was a national of South Korea anda
lawful permanent resident of the United States residing in New

used in the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (âFCPAâ), Title 15,
United States Code, Section 78dd-2(h) (1). BAHN workedâas a
broker at two commercial real estate brokerage firms (âFirm-1â
and âFirm-2"") at offices located in Manhattan. Specifically,
BAHN worked at Firm-1 between in or about February 2013 and
March 2014, and at Firm-2 between in or about March 2014 and May

2015. BAHN is the son of BAN KI SANG, the defendant.
6. At all times relevant to this Indictment, BAN KI

BAN is the father of JOO HYUN BAHN, the defendant.

7. At all times relevant to this Indictment, MALCOLM
HARRIS, the defendant, was a national of the United States who
previously rÃ©sided in Manhattan and Brooklyn, New York. HARRIS
is a self-described arts and fashion consultant and blogger.

8. At all times relevant to this Indictment, âCC-1,â
a co-conspirator not named as a defendant herein, but whose
identity is known to the Grand Jury, was a national of South

10. At all times relevant to this Indictment, the
Fund was a sovereign wealth fund controlled by the government of
Country-1. As such, the Fund was an âinstrumentalityâ of a
foreign government as that term is used in the FCPA, Title 15,
United States Code, Section 78dd-2.

Background on Landmark 72

 

11. In or about 2012, Keangnam completed the
construction of a 72-story commercial office building known as
the Keangnam Hanoi Landmark Tower and two 48-story residential
buildings in Hanoi, Vietnam (collectively, âLandmark 72â). At
the time of its construction, the Landmark 72 office tower was
the tallest building in the Indochina Peninsula. The
construction of Landmark 72 cost more than $1 billion, which
Keangnam financed, in part, through loans issued by South Korean
banks. At all times relevant to this Indictment, Keangnam owned
Landmark 72.

12. In early 2013, Keangnam was experiencing
liquidity problems. Faced with maturing debts owed to its
creditors, including those incurred in the construction of
Landmark 72, Keangnam sought to refinance or sell Landmark 72 to
an investor for approximately $800 million.

13. In or about February 2013, BAN KI SANG, the
defendant, arranged for Keangnam to retain his son, JOO HYUN

BAHN, the defendant, to broker a refinancing of Landmark 72 on
behalf of Keangnam., At the time, BAHN was working as a real
estate broker at Firm-1 in Manhattan. BAN arranged for BAHN to
broker the refinancing despite the fact that BAHN had no prior
experience brokering a deal of the size or complexity of
Landmark 72. If BAHN were successful, he stood to earn a multi-
million dollar-commission for himself and Firm-1.

14. In or about March 2013, JOO HYUN BAHN, the
defendant. was introduced to MALCOLM HARRIS, the defendant,
through a mutual acquaintance in Manhattan. BAHN and HARRIS
began discussing potential business opportunities, including
Landmark 72. HARRIS claimed he could assist BAHN with the
refinance or sale of Landmark 72 through HARRISââs personal
connections, which HARRIS represented as including members of
the royal family of Country-1. In exchange for helping BAHN
secure an investor for Landmark 72, BAHN promised to pay HARRIS
a âcutâ of the multi-million-dollar commission that BAHN
expected to earn from the sale.

The FCPA Bribery Scheme

15, Beginning in or about September 2013, JOO HYUN
BAHN and BAN KI SANG, the defendants, attempted to pay bribes,
and to take advantage of both the purported personal connections
of MALCOLM HARRIS, the defendant, and those of BAHN. and BANâS
own family, in order to convince government officials of

Country-1 to have the Fund acquire Landmark 72, rather than
directly pitching Landmark 72 to the Fund through legitimate
channels.

16. For example, in or about September 2013, JOO HYUN
BAHN, the defendant, with the knowledge and consent of BAN KI
SANG, the defendant, attempted to arrange a meeting with the
Head of State of Country-1 (the âHead of Stateâ) in connection
with the Head of Stateâs visit to New York for the United
Nations General Assembly. BAHN intended to use this meeting as
a forum to pitch the Landmark 72 deal directly to the Head of
State,

17. In connection with the Head of Stateâs visit, on
or about September 18, 2013, JOO HYUN BAHN, the defendant, sent
an email to his supervisors at Firm-1 seeking authorization to
spend $28,000 on âgiftsâ for the Head of State at this meeting.
This $28,000 was to come out of a $100,000 deposit Keangnam had
sent to Firm-1 to cover brokerage expenses. Attached to the
email was a letter signed by BAN KI SANG, the defendant, on
behalf of Keangnam, authorizing Firm-1 to spend $28,000 on âgift
purchases.â BAHNâs supervisors at Firm-1 refused to authorize
BAHNâs request to spend $28,000 on gifts for the Head of State,
and sent a letter to BAN recommending that he âdiscuss any
proposed marketing expenses or gift purchases related to the

[Fund] with [Keangnamâs] legal counsel.â
18. In response to this letter, on or about September
24, 2013, JOO HYUN BAHN, the defendant, sent an email to a
supervisor at Firm-1, in which BAHN tried to use his familyâs
prominence to authorize the payment of the âgiftsâ for the Head
of State. BAHNâs email stated, in part: âI sent an email to [a
senior-level supervisor] specifically not to send this letter
until I talk to my father [BAN KI SANG, the defendant]
As I mentioned . .. IF this deal gets done, it gets done purely
pased on our familyâs reputation with [the Head of State] .â
Later, on or about September 25, 2013, BAHN sent another email
to his supervisors at Firm-1 in which he reported having
discussed Firm-1âs unwillingness to pay for gifts for the Head
of State with his father, BAN. BAHNâs email stated, in part:
â[TOjJur client [Keangnam] was visibly upset due to our âlack of
risk takingâ ... . Our client [Keangnam], especially, my
father [BAN] is upset on the fact that our family is risking our
familyâs reputation to make the deal work while [Firm-1] is
Sitting on the sideline ... .â

19. %In addition to attempting to arrange a meeting

with the Head of State of Country-1, on or about September 24,
2013, JOO HYUN BAHN, the defendant, attempted to deliver a
letter to the Head of State concerning the proposed Landmark 72
deal with the Fund while the Head of State was still in New York

for the United Nations General Assembly. This letter, drafted
by BAHN, offered his familyâs assurances as to the âstability
and profitabilityâ of Landmark 72. BAHN asked MALCOLM HARRIS,
the defendant, to deliver this letter to the Head of State. On
or about September 25, 2013, HARRIS told BAHN he had delivered
the letter. BAHNâs efforts to pitch the Landmark 72 deal
directly to the Head of State, however, were ultimately
unsuccessful.

20. In or about late 2013 and early 2014, having
failed in his initial efforts to convince the Fund to acquire
Landmark 72 by paying bribes and trading on the prominence of
his family, JOO HYUN BAHN, the defendant, exchanged multiple
emails and text messages with MALCOLM HARRIS, the defendant,
concerning Landmark 72. On several occasions, BAHN told HARRIS
that he was âgetting pressureâ from his client, Keangnam,
regarding the deal and that Keangnam was experiencing âsevere
liquidity issues.â HARRIS repeatedly reassured BAHN that he was
in touch with government officials of Country-1 concerning
Landmark 72 and urged BAHN to be patient.

21. On or about February 17, 2014, JOO HYUN BAHN and
MALCOLM HARRIS, the defendants, exchanged text messages
concerning Landmark 72, In the text messages, HARRIS claimed
that he was working with a new contact at the Fund, namely
Foreign Official-1. In the text messages, HARRIS told BAHN that

Foreign Official-1 was in a position to influence the Fund's
decision to acquire Landmark 72, but that Foreign Official-1

would require a bribe in order to do so. The text messages
stated, in part:
HARRIS: Dennis - Iâve been working with my new
. contact [in Country-1] for the
past few days .. . and between us .
these guys are all alike ... at

BAHN:

to the âcalendarâ has pretty much.
spelled it out... . that these slots
have a price

Hi Malcolm. Thanks for the feedback.
Please tell him there is a $13,000,000
fee we can collect if this deal closes
with [the Fund] and we are happy to
share the fee with him as long as he
gets us in front of the [Head of State]
and help us get his approval.

Iâve been pushing this angle
trying not to get too frustrated with
this new guy as he truly is holding all
of the cards ... Iâm possibly
splitting an appointment âgiftâ (is
what they call it) with another client
to get the ball rolling on their
project

Ok Malcolm. Whatever works we will
accommodate. If some sort of upfront
payment is needed to secure a meeting
with the [Head of State] and his
approval please ask him and let me know
and I will ask my client how much we
can spend on your new contact.

22. On or about February 25, 2014, MALCOLM HARRIS,

and JOO HYUN BAHN, the defendants, exchanged text messages about

10
the bribe payment that HARRIS represented was sought by Foreign
Official-1. HARRIS told BAHN that the code word for the bribe
payment to Foreign Official-1 was âroses.â BAHN assured HARRIS
âthat Keangnam would âNaccommodateâ the bribe payment in order to
close the Landmark 72 deal.

23. In or about March 2014, JOO HYUN BAHN, the
defendant, stopped working at Firm-1 and started working at
Firm-2 in Manhattan. In connection with his employment at Firm-
2, on or about March 6, 2014, BAHN Signed Firm-2âs âFCPA
Prevention of Bribery Policy,â which, among other things,
âprohibits any of its Supervised Persons [including BAHN] from
making any corrupt payment to improperly obtain or retain
business anywhere in the world.â While employed by Firm-2, BAHN
continued to try to broker the sale of Landmark 72 to the Fund.

24. On or about March 7, 2014, MALCOLM HARRIS, the
defendant, forwarded to JOO HYUN BAHN, the defendant, an email
which purported to be sent by Foreign Official-1, but which was
in fact written by HARRIS, stating that Foreign Official-1 would
require an upfront payment of %250,000 and a payment of $750,000
after the Landmark 72 deal was approved by the Fund. Later that
day, BAHN forwarded this email purporting to be from Foreign
Official-1 to BAN KI SANG, the defendant. Above the forwarded

email, BAHN wrote that Foreign Official-1 could assist Keangnam

11
with the Landmark 72 deal, but that Keangnam would have to pay
âbribesâ to obtain such assistance.1

25. On or about March 11, 2014, JOO HYUN BAHN, the
defendant, sent MALCOLM HARRIS, the defendant, an email stating
that if BAHN and BAN KI SANG, the defendant, âpush[ed]â Keangnam
to pay the proposed bribes to Foreign Official-1, the company
would do so. BAHN expressed concerns, however, that if the
Landmark 72 deal ultimately was not approved by the Fund, both
he and BAN would be âput in a sticky situation (almost close to
fraud) "" and that in light of their familyâs prominence, âany
negative press linking [BAHN and BAN] to anythingâ would be
âbad.â

26. On or about March 17, 2014, JOO HYUN BAHN, the
defendant, forwarded an email purportedly from Foreign Official-
1, but which appears to have been written by BAHN, to BAN KI
SANG, the defendant. The forwarded email proposed that the Fund
acquire Landmark 72 for $700 million. The email purportedly
from Foreign Official-1 further stated: âOnce [the] requested
roses are received I will push this deal for approval.â Above |

the forwarded email, BAHN wrote to his father that in order for

individuals at Keangnam are substantially in Korean. To the

12
the deal with the Fund to proceed, a âdown paymentâ from
Keangnam was required. BAHN told BAN that Keangnam either had
to âgive him [i.e., Foreign Official-1] the money or Forget
about the whole thing.â

27. On or about April 1, 2014, JOO HYUN BAHN, the
defendant, sent an email to MALCOLM HARRIS, the defendant, which
stated that BAHN âhad a very long conversation with Keangnam
regarding Landmark 72â the night before and that Keangnamâ s
creditors were ânot happyâ with the purported $700 million offer
from the Fund. BAHN told HARRIS that if the Fund increased the
purchase price to $800 million, Keangnam would be willing to
increase the upfront bribe payment to Foreign Official-1 from
$250,000 to $500,000 and pay $2,000,000 to Foreign Official-1
after the deal closed.

28. On or about April 1, 2014, BAN KI SANG, the
defendant, sent an email to JOO HYUN BAHN, the defendant,
concerning the proposed structure of the bribe payments, in
which BAN stated that he was âtrying to push it through using
any means possible,â but that because Keangnam was ânot [his]
company,â BAN was âpushingâ another Keangnam executive. In his
email, BAN also asked BAHN: âIf we were to send a bonus, are
there any instructions?â

29. On or about April 3, 2014, JOO HYUN BAHN, the

defendant, sent an email to MALCOLM HARRIS, the defendant,

13
stating that BAHN had received âapprovalâ from Keangnam for the
proposed $800 million offer for Landmark 72 and the ""$500,000
upfrontâ and â$2,000,000 after closingâ bribe payments for
Foreign Official-1. BAHN explained to HARRIS that the funds
used to pay the bribe to Foreign Official-1 would, however, have
to be disguised as a legitimate payment from Keangnam.

30. Around the time that Joo YUN BAHN and BAN KI
SANG, the defendants, were negotiating the bribe payments for
Foreign Official-1, BAHN caused Keangnam and Firm-2 to enter
into a written agreement pursuant to which Firm-2 agreed to
broker the sale of Landmark 72 in exchange for a percentage of
the sale price. In addition, Keangnam agreed to pay an advance

âdepositâ of $500,000 to Firm-2, which would be credited against

Firm-2's future commission. Under the terms of his employment
with Firm-2, BAHN was entitled to approximately 45 percent of
any commission earned by Firm-2 from the sale of Landmark 72.
As such, if the Fund acquired Landmark 72 for $800 million, BAHN
stood to earn a multi-million-dollar commission. |

31. On or about April 15, 2014 and April 16, 2014,
JOO HYUN BAHN and BAN KI SANG, the defendants, caused Keangnam
to send two wire transfers in the amounts of $410,000 and
$90,000, respectively, from Keangnamâs bank account in South
Korea to Firm-2âs bank account in Manhattan. Using the $500,000

transfer from Keangnam to Firm-2 as collateral, BAHN and CC-1,

14
BAHNâs co-worker at Firm-2, then arranged to borrow $500,000
from CC-1âs business partner in New York to pay the bribe to
Foreign Official-1. Specifically, on or about April 16, 2014,
BAHN and CC-1 caused CC-1âs business partner to write a check
for $500,000 to âMuse Creative Consulting, LLC,â a company
controlled by MALCOLM HARRIS, the defendant. The check was
subsequently delivered to HARRIS so that he could deposit it and
pay the upfront bribe to Foreign Official-1 on behalf of BAHN,
BAN, and Keangnam.,

32, On or about April 17, 2014, JOO HYUN BAHN, the
defendant, sent an email to MALCOLM HARRIS, the defendant, in
which BAHN explained that he had disguised the $500,000
transferred by Keangnam to Firm-2 as a âretainerâ in order to
get the necessary approvals for the transfer from Keangnamâs
creditors since they could not disclose that the money was for
bribery. BAHN further stated, in part:

Also, since the $500,000 is âillegalâ to [al]

certain extent, my father [BAN KI SANG, the

defendant] and myself cannot be involved

directly due to our family ... . Thus, we

had to devise a plan to make everything look

âofficial/legalâ on paper and simultaneously

not get [Keangnam] directly involved with

[the Fund] regarding the ârosesâ matter. On

paper, Keangnam has retained [Firm-2] to

sell Landmark 72 to [the Fund] and has paid

[Firm-2] $500,000 as a retainer to start the

job. But nobody knows the dealings under
the table.

HARRISâs Scheme to Defraud
-.44,,. From in or about March 2013 through in or about
May 2015, MALCOLM HARRIS, the defendant, orchestrated a
fraudulent scheme to steal at least $500,000 in bribe money that
JOO HYUN BAHN and BAN KI SANG, the defendants, attempted to pay
to Foreign Official-1 in connection with the Landmark 72 deal.
In furtherance of this scheme, HARRIS drafted and sent emails
and text messages containing numerous misrepresentations to
BAHN, some of which BAHN forwarded to his client, Keangnam. In
addition, HARRIS forged numerous emails bearing Foreign
Official-1âs name, including the emails purportedly sent from
Foreign official-1 to HARRIS described above, which forgeries
HARRIS forwarded to BAHN. In his emails and text messages,
HARRIS misrepresented, among other things, that:
a. HARRIS had engaged in direct personal

communications with Foreign Official-1 and other government
officials of Country-1, including the Head of State of Country-

1, regarding Landmark 72;

22
b. Foreign Official-1 had assisted HARRIS in
closing other multi-million-dollar deals with the Fund in
exchange for bribes; and

Cc. Foreign Official-1 would assist Keangnam in
its efforts to convince the Fund to acquire Landmark 72 for $800
million if Keangnam paid Foreign Official-1 $2.5 million in
bribes.

45. As MALCOLM HARRIS, the defendant, well knew, none
of these claims was true. In particular, HARRIS never had any
communications with Foreign Official-1 and never paid any bribes
to Foreign Official-1. Rather, HARRIS simply stole the $500,000
in bribe money and spent it on lavish personal expenses.

46. Specifically, on or about April 17, 2014, MALCOLM
HARRIS, the defendant, caused the $500,000 check written by CC-
1's business partner to be deposited into the bank account of
HARRISâs company, Muse Creative Consulting, LLC, at a bank in
Manhattan. Thereafter, HARRIS spent the fraudulent proceeds on
various personal expenses, including airfare and luxury hotels,
meals at expensive restaurants, furniture, and rent for an
apartment in Manhattan and for a six-month lease of a luxury
penthouse condominium in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Several of
these transactions conducted by HARRIS were in amounts that

exceeded $10,000 each.

23
47, Through at least May 2015, MALCOLM HARRIS, the
defendant, continued to make misrepresentations and created
additional forged emails bearing the name of Foreign Official-1,
which HARRIS sent to JOO HYUN BAHN, the defendant, in order to
prevent detection of HARRIS's fraudulent scheme. For example,
on or about May 22, 2014, HARRIS forwarded an email to BAHN that
HARRIS had purportedly received from Foreign Official-1, but was
in reality another forgery, reassuring HARRIS of the Fundâs
_ purported commitment to purchase Landmark 72 and requesting
continued patience. Similarly, in or about September 2014,
HARRIS sent BAHN a forged âLetter of Intentâ concerning Landmark
72 that HARRIS falsely represented had been sent to him by
Foreign Official-1.

26
BAHNâs Scheme to Defraud

 

54, From in or about March 2013 through in or about
May 2015, JOO HYUN BAHN, the defendant, engaged in a fraudulent.
scheme against Keangnam and its creditors, to retain the
exclusive right granted to BAHN by his client, Keangnam, to
broker the refinancing or sale of Landmark 72 in exchange for a
multi-million-dollar commission, and to steal a portion of the.
$500,000 Keangnam sent to Colliers in connection with the bribe
payment for Foreign Official-1.

55. In furtherance of the scheme to defraud Keangnam
and its creditors, JOO HYUN BAHN, the defendant, made numerous
misrepresentations in emails that BAHN sent to Keangnam
executives. Among other things, BAHN falsely claimed that he
had telephone conversations with Foreign Official-1 about
Landmark 72, which never occurred, and that BAHN had received
emails and documents relating to Landmark 72 from Foreign
Official-1 and other individuals, which were never drafted or
sent by those parties. As BAHN was well aware, Keangnam
forwarded many of the communications from BAHN containing these
misrepresentations to its creditors, who stood to lose money if
Keangnam failed to sell Landmark 72.

56. As a result of the fraudulent scheme orchestrated
by JOO HYUN BAHN, the defendant, Keangnam was deprived of

information in connection with its decision-making concerning

27
the companyâs finances, its efforts to sell Landmark 72, and its
dealings with its creditors. For example, because BAHN falsely
represented that the deal with the Fund was progressing,
Keangnam did not explore other options for disposing of Landmark
72, which ultimately led to Keangnamâs application for court
receivership in South Korea.

57. As part of the scheme to defraud Keangnam and its
creditors, JOO HYUN BAHN, the defendant, also made
misrepresentations to Keangnam and Firm-2 in order to obtain
approximately $225,000 of the $500,000 that Keangnam had
transferred to Firm-2 in connection with the bribe payment for
Foreign Official-1. BAHN provided a letter dated April 28,
2014, purportedly signed by the Chief Operating Officer of
Keangnam, but which was in fact forged by BAHN, stating that
Firm-2 had âearnedâ the $500,000 that Keangnam had wired to
Firm-2 and that such money âshall not be refundable.â BAHN had
previously represented to Keangnam, however, that the $500,000
was being held in escrow at Firm-2 pending finalization of the
Landmark 72 deal. Based upon the April 28, 2014 letter, Firm-2
paid BAHN approximately 45 percent, or $225,000, of the $500,000
commission. âApproximately $216,666.67 of BAHNâs share of the
commission was paid by Firm-2 with a check dated May 15, 2014,

which was made out to a company controlled by BAHN. Even after

28
BAHN received the $225,000, BAHN continued to misrepresent to
Keangnam that Firm-2 held the entire $500,000 âin escrow.â

58. Beginning in or about June 2014, as Keangnamâs
debt maturity deadlines were approaching, JOO HYUN BAHN, the.
defendant, began forging emails and documents from Foreign
Official-1, the Fund, and other entities and individuals, which
purported to show that the Fundâs acquisition of Landmark 72 was
progressing. BAHN sent these forged documents to Keangnam
executives knowing full well that Keangnam would refrain from
exploring other options for disposing of Landmark 72 if it
believed that the deal with the Fund was going to close.

59. For example, on or about June 30, 2014, JOO HYUN
BAHN, the defendant, sent an email to MALCOLM HARRIS, the
defendant, which stated, in part:

Today is June 30th and I have to give my

clients something. We canât just sit on it

for [Foreign Official-1] to send us

something.

Therefore, in order to buy time, I am going:

to âmock-upâ a letter in [Foreign Official-

1âs] name containing no other information
than what he has already given us via email.

Iâm going to have it mocked up as [Foreign
Official-1âs] sending the letter to [Firm-2] Â©
and Iâll just forward it to my client so
that they can show it to their creditors.
BAHN then emailed to HARRIS a draft of a letter on purported

letterhead of the Fund and bearing the name, purported

29
signature, and contact information for Foreign Official-1. -The
letter, which was addressed to BAHN and Firm-2, stated, in part:
âAs per your request, this letter will fully demonstrate [the
Fund's] . . . intention to acquire [Landmark 72] from your
client, [Keangnam] . . . to satisfy your clientâs status report
requirement to its creditors.â

60. Later that day, JOO HYUN BAHN, the defendant,
drafted and forwarded a fake email, purportedly from Foreign
Official-1, attaching the above-described âmocked-upâ letter to
BAN KI SANG, the defendant, and another executive at Keangnam.
Above the forwarded email, BAHN wrote: âAttached is the official
document from [the Fund].â In reliance upon this forged letter,
and as BAHN well knew, Keangnam sought an extension of its debt
maturities from its creditors, for which it incurred substantial
loan extension fees.

61. On or about January 5, 2015, JOO HYUN BAHN, the
defendant, informed MALCOLM HARRIS, the defendant, that
Keangnamâs lead creditor had taken control of the company as of
January 1 and had given Firm-2 and BAHN until on or about
February 15, 2015, to close the Landmark 72 deal with the Fund.
BAHN told HARRIS that Keangnam had demanded that Firm-2 return
the $500,000 that Keangnam had wired to Firm-2 in or about April
2014, approximately 45 percent of which BAHN had already

fraudulently caused Firm-2 to pay to BAHN.

30
62. In furtherance of the scheme to defraud Keangnam
and its creditors, on or about January 13, 2015, JOO HYUN BAHN,
the defendant, emailed a bank confirmation letter purportedly
signed by the manager of a branch of a bank located in London,
England (âBank-1â), but which was in fact forged by BAHN (the
âForged Bank Letterâ), to Keangnam. The Forged Bank Letter
purported to confirm that the Fund had opened an account at
Bank-1 for the purpose of acquiring Landmark 72 and that the
account had on deposit more than $800 million. BAHN sent the
Forged Bank Letter to Keangnam to convince his client that the
Fund was getting close to closing on its acquisition of Landmark
72. In truth, Bank-1 never issued the Forged Bank Letter and
the Fund never had any such account at Bank-1.

63. In furtherance of the scheme to defraud Keangnam
and its creditors, on or about January 28, 2015, JOO HYUN BAHN,
the defendant, registered a fake domain name for an entity
related to the Fund and created a fake email address associated
with that. domain name for Foreign Official-1. The next day,
BAHN used this fake email account to send an email that appeared
to have been sent by Foreign Official-1 to BAHN himself. BAHN
then forwarded this forged email to Keangnam. The email falsely
stated, among other things, that the Fund had submitted
Keangnamâs proposed Landmark 72 sales contract to the Fundâs law

firm in London, England, for review. In reality, the Fund had

31
not retained such law firm and was not considering the Landmark
72 contract. Thereafter, BAHN continued to use the fake email
account to send additional forged emails to Keangnam, which
purported to be from Foreign Official-1 and bore Foreign
Official-1âs name.

64, JOO HYUN BAHN, the defendant, engaged in the
scheme to defraud Keangnam and its creditors notwithstanding his
recognition of the importance of the Landmark 72 deal to
Keangnamâs viability as a company, as well as to Keangnamâs
creditors. As BAHN wrote in an email to MALCOLM HARRIS, the
defendant, on or about December 14, 2014: âWe have the life of
an entire firm and the lives of almost 1,000 employees in our
hands. They need the liquidity from this deal to stay afloat.â
Similarly, on or about March 10, 2015, BAHN wrote to HARRIS:
â([M]y client [Keangnam] is in jeopardy of financial meltdown and
they have till end of March to cure. In all seriousness, they
really will blame [the Fund] for denying them of other
opportunities to sell Landmark 72 due to [the Fundâs] promises
that were made through us.â Nevertheless, BAHN continued to lie
to Keangnam and its creditors regarding the status of the Fund's
purported acquisition of Landmark 72 through at least May 2015.
Ultimately, when Keangnam failed to sell or refinance Landmark
72, the company was forced to enter court receivership in South

Korea.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Tuesday, January 10, 2017

Four Individuals Charged for Alleged Involvement in Foreign Bribery Scheme Involving $800
Million International Real Estate Deal

Court documents were unsealed today charging four individuals for their roles in a scheme to pay $2.5 million in
bribes to facilitate the $800 million sale of a commercial building in Vietnam to a Middle Eastern sovereign wealth
fund.

Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Preet
Bharara of the Southern District of New York and Assistant Director in Charge William F. Sweeney Jr. of the FBIâs
New York Field Office made the announcement.

âThis alleged conduct proves the adage that there is truly no honor among thieves,â said Assistant Attorney General
Caldwell. âThe indictment alleges that two defendants wanted to bribe a government official; instead they were
defrauded by their co-defendant. Todayâs charges are another example of the Criminal Divisionâs commitment to
rooting out all manner of corruption.â

âThe father-son defendants, Ban Ki Sang and Joo Hyun Bahn, allegedly conspired to bribe a foreign official to close
an $800 million deal for a 72-story skyscraper in Vietnam, a deal that would have led to a multimillion-dollar
commission for the Manhattan real estate broker son and much needed capital for the fatherâs construction
company in Korea,â said U.S. Attorney Bharara. âBut these alleged schemers were themselves double-crossed, as
the man who purportedly set up the bribery scheme, Malcolm Harris, took the bribe money and pocketed it. This
alleged bribery and fraud scheme offends all who believe in honest and transparent business, and it stands as a
reminder that those who bring international corruption to New York City, as alleged here, will face the scrutiny of
American law enforcement.â

âWhen Ban, a senior executive at Landmark 72, realized the debts owed to his companyâs creditors were mounting,
he sought the support of his son Bahn, a broker for a real estate firm in Manhattan,â said Assistant Director in
Charge Sweeney. âThe plan was for Bahn to secure an investor for Landmark 72, and the brokerage agreement
they entered into would ultimately secure Bahn a lucrative profit. But instead of lawfully obtaining financing for the
deal, they allegedly entered into an illegal agreement with Harris to bribe a foreign official into purchasing the
property. In the end, they were hoodwinked by their very own criminal activity.â

Joo Hyun Bahn, aka Dennis Bahn, 38, of Tenafly, New Jersey, and his father, Ban Ki Sang (Ban), 69, of Seoul, South
Korea, are each charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), three
counts of violating the FCPA, one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering and one count of money
laundering. In addition, Bahn and Malcolm Harris, 52, of New York City, are each charged with one count of wire
fraud, one count of conducting monetary transactions in illegal funds and aggravated identity theft. San Woo, aka
John Woo, 35, of Edgewater, New Jersey, was charged separately by complaint with one count of conspiracy to
violate the FCPA. Bahn was arrested in Tenafly earlier this morning, and Woo was arrested at JFK Airport. Bahn and
Woo are expected to be presented later today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Kevin Nathaniel Fox of the Southern
District of New York. Ban and Harris remain at large.

According to the indictment and the complaint, from in or about March 2013 through in or about May 2015, Ban
was a senior executive at Keangnam Enterprises Co. Ltd. (Keangnam), a South Korean construction company that
built and owned Landmark 72, a building complex in Hanoi, Vietnam. In early 2013, Keangnam was experiencing a
liquidity crisis; the debts owed to the companyâs creditors were maturing and Keangnam needed to raise capital.
Ban allegedly convinced Keangnam to hire his son Bahn to secure an investor for Landmark 72. Thereafter,
Keangnam entered into an exclusive brokerage agreement with Bahn, who worked as a broker at a commercial real
estate firm in New York City, and his firm. Pursuant to the agreement, Bahn stood to earn a multimillion-dollar
commission from Keangnam if he was successful in securing an investor.

Instead of obtaining financing through legitimate channels, Bahn and Ban allegedly conspired to pay bribes to a
foreign official of a Middle Eastern country, in order to induce the official to use his influence to convince his
countryâs sovereign wealth fund to acquire Landmark 72 for approximately $800 million. Harris, who held himself
out as an agent of the foreign official despite not actually having such a relationship, allegedly deceived Bahn and
Ban by sending numerous emails that were purportedly sent by the foreign official. According to the indictment, in
or about April 2014, Bahn and Ban agreed to pay, through Harris, $2.5 million in bribes to the official, including
$500,000 upfront and $2 million upon the close of the sale of Landmark 72. Woo helped Bahn and Ban obtain the
$500,000 that was used as the upfront bribe payment. Bahn and Ban arranged the transfer of the $500,000 to
Harris for him to pay to the foreign official, unaware that Harris did not have the relationship he claimed with the
foreign official. Instead, Harris stole the $500,000, spending the money on lavish personal expenses, including rent
for a luxury penthouse apartment in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.

According to the indictment, over the course of 2014 and 2015, Keangnamâs liquidity crisis worsened. Believing
that the planned bribery would result in the sale of Landmark 72, and not wanting to lose his commission, Bahn
allegedly engaged in a fraudulent scheme to trick Keangnam and its creditors into believing the sovereign wealth
fund was close to acquiring Landmark 72. In furtherance of the fraudulent scheme, Bahn repeatedly lied to
Keangnam and its creditors about the status of the Landmark 72 deal, knowing that Keangnam and its creditors
would rely upon the misrepresentations. In addition, Bahn forged emails from the foreign official and other
documents to make the sale of Landmark 72 to the sovereign wealth fund appear imminent to Keangnam and its
creditors. Ultimately, when the sale of Landmark 72 to the sovereign wealth fund failed to materialize, Keangnam
was forced to enter court receivership in South Korea. Bahn is also alleged to have stolen approximately $225,000
of the $500,000 that Keangnam had advanced Bahnâs firm to cover brokerage expenses.

The charges contained in the indictment and the complaint are merely accusations, and the defendants are
presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.

FBIâs New York Field Office International Corruption Squad investigated the case. The Department of Justiceâs
Office of International Affairs is providing assistance in this investigation. Trial Attorney Dennis R. Kihm of the
Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel Noble of the Southern District of New Yorkâs
Complex Frauds and Cybercrime Unit are prosecuting the case.

The Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional
information about the departmentâs FCPA enforcement efforts can be found at www,justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.

DEFERRED PROSECUTION AGREEMENT

Defendant Beam Suntory Inc. (the âCompanyâ), pursuant to authority granted by the
Companyâs Board of Directors reflected in Attachment B, and the United States Department of
Justice, Criminal Division, Fraud Section (the âFraud Sectionâ), and the United States Attorneyâs
Office for the Northern District of Illinois (the âOfficeâ) enter into this Deferred Prosecution
Agreement (the âAgreementâ).

Criminal Information and Acceptance of Responsibility

1, The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Fraud Section and the Office will
file the attached one-count criminal Information in the United States District Court for the
Northern District of Illinois charging the Company with one count of conspiracy to commit an
offense against the United States, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 371, that is,
to violate: (1) the anti-bribery provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (âFCPAâ),
as amended, Title 15, United States Code, Sections 78dd-1 and 78dd-2; (2) the internal controls
provisions of the FCPA, as amended, Title 15, United States Code, Sections 78m(b)(2)(B),
78m(b)(5) and 78ff(a); and (3) the books and records provisions of the FCPA, as amended, Title
15, United States Code, Sections 78m(b)(2)(A), 78m(b)(5) and 78ff(a). In so doing, the Company:
(a) knowingly waives its right to indictment on this charge, as well as all rights to a speedy trial
pursuant to the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, Title 18, United States Code,

1
Pe PL
PRAILPOS Oa

Section 3161, and Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 48(b); and (b) knowingly waives any
objection with respect to venue to any charges by the United States arising out of the conduct
described in the Statement of Facts attached as Attachment A (âStatement of Factsâ) and consents
to the filing of the Information, as provided under the terms of this Agreement, in the United States
District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The Fraud Section and the Office agree to defer
prosecution of the Company pursuant to the terms and conditions described below.

2. The Company admits, accepts, and acknowledges that it is responsible under United
States law for the acts of its officers, directors, employees, and agents as charged in the
Information, and as set forth in the Statement of Facts, and that the allegations described in the
Information and the facts described in the Statement of Facts are true and accurate. The Company
agrees that, effective as of the date the Company signs this Agreement, in any prosecution that is
deferred by this Agreement, it will not dispute the Statement of Facts set forth in this Agreement,
and, in any such prosecution, the Statement of Facts shall be admissible as: (a) substantive
evidence offered by the government in its case-in-chief and rebuttal case; (b) impeachment
evidence offered by the government on cross-examination; and (c) evidence at any sentencing
hearing or other hearing. In addition, in connection therewith, the Company agrees not to assert
any claim under the United States Constitution, Rule 410 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, Rule
11(f) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, Section 1B1.1(a) of the United States Sentencing
Guidelines (âU.S.S.G.â or âSentencing Guidelinesâ), or any other federal rule that the Statement

of Facts should be suppressed or is otherwise inadmissible as evidence in any form.
Term of the Agreement

3. This Agreement is effective for a period beginning on the date on which the
Information is filed and ending three years from that date (the âTermâ). The Company agrees,
however, that, in the event the Fraud Section and the Office determine, in their sole discretion, that
the Company has knowingly violated any provision of this Agreement or has failed to completely
perform or fulfill each of the Companyâs obligations under this Agreement, an extension or
extensions of the Term may be imposed by the Fraud Section and the Office, in their sole
discretion, for up to a total additional time period of one year, without prejudice to the Fraud
Section and the Officeâs right to proceed as provided in Paragraphs 14 to 16 below. Any extension
of the Agreement extends all terms of this Agreement, including the terms of the reporting
requirement in Attachment D, for an equivalent period. Conversely, in the event the Fraud Section
and the Office find, in their sole discretion, that there exists a change in circumstances sufficient
to eliminate the need for the reporting requirement in Attachment D, and that the other provisions
of this Agreement have been satisfied, the Agreement may be terminated early. If the court refuses
to grant exclusion of time under the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. Â§ 3161(h)(2), the Term shall be
deemed to have not begun, and all the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed null and void,
except that the statute of limitations for any prosecution relating to the conduct described in the
Statement of Facts shall be tolled from the date on which this Agreement is signed until the date
the Court refuses to grant the exclusion of time plus six months, and except for the provisions
contained within Paragraph 2 of this Agreement.

Relevant Considerations

4. The Fraud Section and the Office enter into this Agreement based on the individual

facts and circumstances presented by this case and the Company, including:

3
a. the Company did not receive voluntary disclosure credit pursuant to the
FCPA Corporate Enforcement Policy in the Department of Justice Manual 9-47.120, or pursuant
to the Sentencing Guidelines, because it did not timely disclose to the Fraud Section and the Office
the conduct described in the Statement of Facts, and because prior to the Companyâs disclosure, a
former Company employee sent an email to the Company, copying the U.S. and Indian
governments, alerting them to âillegal cash transactionsâ associated with the Companyâs
distributors in India;

b. the Company received partial credit for its cooperation with the Fraud
Section and the Officeâs investigation, including making factual presentations to the Fraud Section
and the Office, making foreign-based employees available for interviews in the United States, and
producing documents to the Fraud Section and the Office from foreign countries;

C. the Company did not receive full credit for its cooperation due to its
inconsistent and, at times, inadequate cooperation, including positions taken by the Company that
were not consistent with full cooperation, as well as significant delays caused by the Company in
reaching a timely resolution and its refusal to accept responsibility for several years;

d. the Company provided to the Fraud Section and the Office all relevant facts
known to it, including information about the individuals involved in the conduct described in the
Statement of Facts and conduct disclosed to the Fraud Section and the Office prior to the
Agreement;

e. the Company engaged in remedial measures, including: suspending
operations in India for a period of time, implementing enhanced controls, including additional

controls over disbursements and interactions with government officials, requiring in-person
compliance training for employees, hiring a dedicated Chief Compliance Officer and an APSA
regional compliance officer, and hiring new management in India;

f. the Company did not receive full credit for its remediation because it failed
to discipline certain individuals involved in the conduct described in the Statement of Facts;

g. although the Company had inadequate anti-corruption controls and an
inadequate anti-corruption compliance program during the period of the conduct described in the
Statement of Facts, the Company has enhanced and has committed to continuing to enhance its
compliance program and internal controls, including ensuring that its compliance program satisfies
the minimum elements set forth in Attachment C to this Agreement (Corporate Compliance
Program);

h. based on the Companyâs remediation and the state of its compliance
program, and the Companyâs agreement to report to the Fraud Section and the Office as set forth
in Attachment D to this Agreement (Corporate Compliance Reporting), the Fraud Section and the
Office determined that an independent compliance monitor was unnecessary;

i. the nature and seriousness of the offense conduct, as described in the
Statement of Facts, including making corrupt payments in India, the falsification of books and
records to conceal improper payments, and the willful failure to implement an adequate system of
internal controls, which included efforts by a then-member of Beamâs Legal Department to
affirmatively avoid uncovering information related to improper activities and practices by third-
parties engaged by the Company in India that presented corruption risks, as well as the duration of
the misconduct;

j. the Company has no prior criminal history;
k. the Company resolved with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
(âSECâ) through a cease-and-desist proceeding relating to the conduct described in the attached
Statement of Facts, but the Fraud Section and the Office are not crediting the penalty paid to the
SEC because the Company did not seek to coordinate a parallel resolution with the Fraud Section
and the Office;

I. the Company has agreed to continue to cooperate with the Fraud Section
and the Office in any ongoing investigation as described in Paragraph 5 below;

m. accordingly, after considering (a) through (1) above, the Fraud Section and
the Office believe that the appropriate resolution in this case is a Deferred Prosecution Agreement
with the Company; a criminal monetary penalty in the amount of $19,572,885, which reflects a
discount of ten percent off the bottom of the otherwise-applicable Sentencing Guidelines fine
range; and the Companyâs agreement to report to the Fraud Section and the Office as set forth in
Attachment D to this Agreement.

Future Cooperation and Disclosure Requirements

5. The Company shall cooperate fully with the Fraud Section and the Office in any
and all matters relating to the conduct described in the Statement of Facts and other conduct under
investigation by the Fraud Section and the Office at any time during the Term, subject to applicable
laws and regulations, until the later of the date upon which all investigations and prosecutions
arising out of such conduct are concluded, or the end of the Term. At the request of the Fraud
Section and the Office, the Company shall also cooperate fully with other domestic or foreign law
enforcement and regulatory authorities and agencies, as well as the Multilateral Development
Banks (âMDBsâ), in any investigation of the Company, its parent company, its subsidiaries, or its
affiliates, or any of its present or former officers, directors, employees, agents, and consultants, or

r

â

any other party, in any and all matters relating to the conduct described in this Agreement and the
Statement of Facts and other conduct under investigation by the Fraud Section and the Office. The
Companyâs cooperation pursuant to this Paragraph is subject to applicable law and regulations, as
well as valid claims of attorney-client privilege or attorney work product doctrine; however, the
Company must provide to the Fraud Section and the Office a log of any information or cooperation
that is not provided based on an assertion of law, regulation, or privilege, and the Company bears
the burden of establishing the validity of any such assertion. The Company agrees that its
cooperation pursuant to this paragraph shall include, but not be limited to, the following:

a. The Company shall truthfully disclose all factual information with respect
to its activities, those of its parent company, subsidiaries, and affiliates, and those of its present
and former directors, officers, employees, agents, and consultants, including any evidence or
allegations and internal or external investigations, about which the Company has any knowledge
or about which the Fraud Section and the Office may inquire. This obligation of truthful disclosure
includes, but is not limited to, the obligation of the Company to provide to the Fraud Section and
the Office, upon request, any document, record or other tangible evidence about which the Fraud
Section and the Office may inquire of the Company. |

b. Upon request of the Fraud Section and the Office, the Company shall
designate knowledgeable employees, agents or attorneys to provide to the Fraud Section and the
Office the information and materials described in Paragraph 5(a) above on behalf of the Company.
It is further understood that the Company must at all times provide complete, truthful, and accurate
information.

Cc. The Company shall use its best efforts to make available for interviews or
testimony, as requested by the Fraud Section and the Office, present or former officers, directors,

7

employees, agents and consultants of the Company. This obligation includes, but is not limited
to, sworn testimony before a federal grand jury or in federal trials, as well as interviews with
domestic or foreign law enforcement and regulatory authorities. Cooperation under this Paragraph
shall include identification of witnesses who, to the knowledge of the Company, may have material
information regarding the matters under investigation.

d. With respect to any information, testimony, documents, records or other
tangible evidence provided to the Fraud Section and the Office pursuant to this Agreement, the
Company consents to any and all disclosures to other governmental authorities, including United
States authorities and those of a foreign government, as well as the MDBs, of such materials as
the Fraud Section and the Office, in their sole discretion, shall deem appropriate.

6. In addition to the obligations in Paragraph 5, during the Term, should the Company
learn of any evidence or allegation of conduct that may constitute a violation of the FCPA anti-
bribery provisions had the conduct occurred within the jurisdiction of the United States, the
Company shall promptly report such evidence or allegation to the Fraud Section and the Office.

Payment of Monetary Penalty

7. The Fraud Section and the Office and the Company agree that application of the

Sentencing Guidelines to determine the applicable fine range yields the following analysis:

a. The November 1, 2018! version of the Sentencing Guidelines is applicable
to this matter.

b. Offense Level. Based upon U.S.S.G. Â§ 2B1.1, the total offense level is 28,
calculated as follows:?

 

! Due to changes in U.S.S.G. Â§ 8C2.4 that potentially implicate ex post facto concerns, the 2014 U.S.S.G. manual
was used for the Â§ 8C2.4 calculation.
2 The offense level was calculated using U.S.S.G. Â§ 2B1.1, because a calculation under U.S.S.G. Â§ 2C1.1 resulted in
a lower total offense level due to the uncertainty regarding the calculation of the value of the benefits obtained from
the bribery conduct, and was not altered by a grouping analysis pursuant to U.S.S.G. Â§ 3D.

calculated as follows:

The Company agrees to pay a total monetary penalty in the amount of $19,572,885 (the âTotal
Criminal Fineâ). This reflects a ten percent discount off the bottom of the applicable Sentencing

Guidelines fine range. The Total Criminal Fine will be paid to the United States Treasury within

ten business days of the execution of this Agreement. The Company, the Fraud Section, and the
Office agree that this penalty is appropriate given the facts and circumstances of this case,
including the Relevant Considerations described in Paragraph 4 of this Agreement. The Total
Criminal Fine is final and shall not be refunded. Furthermore, nothing in this Agreement shall be
deemed an agreement by the Fraud Section and the Office that the Total Criminal Fine is the
maximum penalty that may be imposed in any future prosecution, and the Fraud Section and the
Office are not precluded from arguing in any future prosecution that the Court should impose a
higher fine, although the Fraud Section and the Office agree that under those circumstances, they
will recommend to the Court that any amount paid under this Agreement should be offset against
any fine the Court imposes as part of a future judgment. The Company acknowledges that no tax
deduction may be sought in connection with the payment of any part of the Total Criminal Fine.
The Company shall not seek or accept directly or indirectly reimbursement or indemnification
from any source with regard to the penalty or disgorgement amounts that the Company pays
pursuant to this Agreement or any other agreement entered into with an enforcement authority or
regulator concerning the facts set forth in the Statement of Facts.
Conditional Release from Liability

8. Subject to Paragraphs 14 to 16, the Fraud Section and the Office agree, except as
provided in this Agreement, that they will not bring any criminal or civil case against the Company
relating to any of the conduct described in the Statement of Facts or the criminal Information filed
pursuant to this Agreement. The Fraud Section and the Office, however, may use any information
related to the conduct described in the Statement of Facts against the Company: (a) in a prosecution

for perjury or obstruction of justice; (b) in a prosecution for making a false statement; (c) in a

prosecution or other proceeding relating to any crime of violence; or (d) in a prosecution or other
proceeding relating to a violation of any provision of Title 26 of the United States Code.

Deferred Prosecution

12. In consideration of the undertakings agreed to by the Company herein, the Fraud
Section and the Office agree that any prosecution of the Company for the conduct set forth in the
Statement of Facts be and hereby is deferred for the Term. To the extent there is conduct disclosed
by the Company that is not set forth in the Statement of Facts, such conduct will not be exempt
from further prosecution and is not within the scope of or relevant to this Agreement.

13. The Fraud Section and the Office further agree that if the Company fully complies
with all of its obligations under this Agreement, the Fraud Section and the Office will not continue
the criminal prosecution against the Company described in Paragraph 1 and, at the conclusion of
the Term, this Agreement shall expire. Within six months after the Agreementâs expiration, the
Fraud Section and the Office shall seek dismissal with prejudice of the criminal Information filed
against the Company described in Paragraph 1, and agree not to file charges in the future against
the Company based on the conduct described in this Agreement and the Statement of Facts. If,
however, the Fraud Section and the Office determine during this six-month period that the

Company breached the Agreement during the Term, as described in Paragraph 14, the Fraud

12
Sectionâs and the Officeâs ability to extend the Term, as described in Paragraph 3, or to pursue
other remedies, including those described in Paragraphs 14 to 16, remains in full effect.
Breach of the Agreement

14. If, during the Term, the Company (a) commits any felony under U.S. federal law;
(b) provides in connection with this Agreement deliberately false, incomplete, or misleading
information, including in connection with its disclosure of information about individual
culpability; (c) fails to cooperate as set forth in Paragraphs 5 and 6 of this Agreement; (d) fails to
implement a compliance program as set forth in Paragraphs 9 and 10 of this Agreement and
Attachment C; (e) commits any acts that, had they occurred within the jurisdictional reach of the
FCPA, would be a violation of the FCPA; or (f) otherwise fails to completely perform or fulfill
each of the Companyâs obligations under the Agreement, regardless of whether the Fraud Section
and the Office become aware of such a breach after the Term is complete, the Company shall
thereafter be subject to prosecution for any federal criminal violation of which the Fraud Section
and the Office have knowledge, including, but not limited to, the charges in the Information
described in Paragraph 1, which may be pursued by the Fraud Section and the Office in the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of Illinois or any other appropriate venue. Determination
of whether the Company has breached the Agreement and whether to pursue prosecution of the
Company shall be in the Fraud Section and the Officeâs sole discretion. Any such prosecution
may be premised on information provided by the Company or its personnel. Any such prosecution
relating to the conduct described in the Statement of Facts or relating to conduct known to the
Fraud Section and the Office prior to the date on which this Agreement was signed that is not time-
barred by the applicable statute of limitations on the date of the signing of this Agreement may be
commenced against the Company, notwithstanding the expiration of the statute of limitations,

signing this Agreement, the Company agrees that the statute of limitations with respect to any such
prosecution that is not time-barred on the date of the signing of this Agreement shall be tolled for
the Term plus one year. In addition, the Company agrees that the statute of limitations as to any
violation of federal law that occurs during the Term will be tolled from the date upon which the
violation occurs until the earlier of the date upon which the Fraud Section and the Office are made
aware of the violation or the duration of the Term plus five years, and that this period shall be
excluded from any calculation of time for purposes of the application of the statute of limitations.

15. In the event the Fraud Section and the Office determine that the Company has
breached this Agreement, the Fraud Section and the Office agree to provide the Company with
written notice of such breach prior to instituting any prosecution resulting from such breach.
Within thirty days of receipt of such notice, the Company shall have the opportunity to respond to
the Fraud Section and the Office in writing to explain the nature and circumstances of such breach,
as well as the actions the Company has taken to address and remediate the situation, which
explanation the Fraud Section and the Office shall consider in determining whether to pursue
prosecution of the Company.

16. In the event the Fraud Section and the Office determine that the Company has
breached this Agreement: (a) all statements made by or on behalf of the Company to the Fraud
Section and the Office or to the Court, including the Statement of Facts, and any testimony given
by the Company before a grand jury, a court, or any tribunal, or at any legislative hearings, whether
prior or subsequent to this Agreement, and any leads derived from such statements or testimony,
shall be admissible in evidence in any and all criminal proceedings brought by the Fraud Section
and the Office against the Company; and (b) the Company shall not assert any claim under the

United States Constitution, Rule 11(f) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rule 410 of the
Federal Rules of Evidence, or any other federal rule that any such statements or testimony made
by or on behalf of the Company prior or subsequent to this Agreement, or any leads derived
therefrom, should be suppressed or are otherwise inadmissible. The decision whether conduct or
statements of any current director, officer or employee, or any person acting on behalf of, or at the
direction of, the Company, will be imputed to the Company for the purpose of determining whether
the Company has violated any provision of this Agreement shall be in the sole discretion of the
Fraud Section and the Office.

17. The Company acknowledges that the Fraud Section and the Office have made no
representations, assurances, or promises concerning what sentence may be imposed by the Court
if the Company breaches this Agreement and this matter proceeds to judgment. The Company
further acknowledges that any such sentence is solely within the discretion of the Court and that
nothing in this Agreement binds or restricts the Court in the exercise of such discretion.

18. On the date that the period of deferred prosecution specified in this Agreement
expires, the Company, by the Chief Executive Officer of the Company and the Chief Financial
Officer of the Company, will certify to the Fraud Section and the Office, in the form of executing
the document attached as Attachment E to this Agreement, that the Company has met its disclosure
obligations pursuant to Paragraph 6 of this Agreement. Each certification will be deemed a
material statement and representation by the Company to the executive branch of the United States

Sale, Merger, or Other Change in Corporate Form of Company

19. Except as may otherwise be agreed by the parties in connection with a particular
transaction, the Company agrees that in the event that, during the Term, it undertakes any change
in corporate form, including if it sells, merges, or transfers business operations that are material to
the Companyâs consolidated operations, or to the operations of any subsidiaries or affiliates
involved in the conduct described in the Statement of Facts, as they exist as of the date of this
Agreement, whether such sale is structured as a sale, asset sale, merger, transfer, or other change
in corporate form, it shall include in any contract for sale, merger, transfer, or other change in
corporate form a provision binding the purchaser, or any successor in interest thereto, to the
obligations described in this Agreement. The purchaser or successor in interest must also agree in
writing that the Fraud Section and the Officeâs ability to determine a breach under this Agreement
is applicable in full force to that entity. The Company agrees that the failure to include these
provisions in the transaction will make any such transaction null and void. The Company shall
provide notice to the Fraud Section and the Office at least thirty (30) days prior to undertaking any
such sale, merger, transfer, or other change in corporate form. The Fraud Section and the Office
shall notify the Company prior to such transaction (or series of transactions) if it determines that
the transaction(s) will have the effect of circumventing or frustrating the enforcement purposes of
this Agreement. If at any time during the Term the Company engages in a transaction(s) that has
the effect of circumventing or frustrating the enforcement purposes of this Agreement, the Fraud
Section and the Office may deem it a breach of this Agreement pursuant to Paragraphs 14 to 16 of
this Agreement. Nothing herein shall restrict the Company from indemnifying (or otherwise
holding harmless) the purchaser or successor in interest for penalties or other costs arising from
any conduct that may have occurred prior to the date of the transaction, so long as such

16

indemnification does not have the effect of circumventing or frustrating the enforcement purposes
of this Agreement, as determined by the Fraud Section and the Office.
Public Statements by Company

20. The Company expressly agrees that it shall not, through present or future attorneys,
officers, directors, employees, agents or any other person authorized to speak for the Company,
make any public statement, in litigation or otherwise, contradicting the acceptance of responsibility
by the Company set forth above or the facts described in the Statement of Facts. Any such
contradictory statement shall, subject to cure rights of the Company described below, constitute a
breach of this Agreement, and the Company thereafter shall be subject to prosecution as set forth
in Paragraphs 14 to 16 of this Agreement. The decision whether any public statement by any such
person contradicting a fact contained in the Statement of Facts will be imputed to the Company
for the purpose of determining whether it has breached this Agreement shall be at the sole
discretion of the Fraud Section and the Office. If the Fraud Section and the Office determine that
a public statement by any such person contradicts in whole or in part a statement contained in the
Statement of Facts, the Fraud Section and the Office shall so notify the Company, and the
Company may avoid a breach of this Agreement by publicly repudiating such statement(s) within
five business days after notification. The Company shall be permitted to raise defenses and to
assert affirmative claims in other proceedings relating to the matters set forth in the Statement of
Facts provided that such defenses and claims do not contradict, in whole or in part, a statement
contained in the Statement of Facts. This Paragraph does not apply to any statement made by any
present or former officer, director, employee, or agent of the Company in the course of any
criminal, regulatory, or civil case initiated against such individual, unless such individual is
speaking on behalf of the Company.

17
21. The Company agrees that if it, or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries or
affiliates, issues a press release or holds any press conference in connection with this Agreement,
the Company shall first consult with the Fraud Section and the Office to determine (a) whether the
text of the release or proposed statements at the press conference are true and accurate with respect
to matters between the Fraud Section and the Office and the Company; and (b) whether the Fraud
Section and the Office have any objection to the release.

22. The Fraud Section and the Office agree, if requested to do so, to bring to the
attention of law enforcement and regulatory authorities the facts and circumstances relating to the
nature of the conduct underlying this Agreement, including the nature and quality of the
Companyâs cooperation and remediation. By agreeing to provide this information to such
authorities, the Fraud Section and the Office are not agreeing to advocate on behalf of the
Company, but rather are agreeing to provide facts to be evaluated independently by such
authorities.

Limitations on Binding Effect of Agreement

23. This Agreement is binding on the Company and the Fraud Section and the Office
but specifically does not bind any other component of the Department of Justice, other federal
agencies, or any state, local or foreign law enforcement or regulatory agencies, or any other
authorities, although the Fraud Section and the Office will bring the cooperation of the Company
and its compliance with its other obligations under this Agreement to the attention of such agencies
and authorities if requested to do so by the Company.

Criminal Division, Fraud Section (the âFraud Sectionâ), the United States Attorneyâs Office for
the Northern District of Illinois (the âOfficeâ), and Beam Suntory Inc. (ââBEAMâ or the
âCompanyâ). BEAM hereby agrees and stipulates that the following facts and conclusions of law
are true and accurate. BEAM admits, accepts, and acknowledges that it is responsible for the acts
of its officers, directors, employees, and agents as set forth below. Should the Fraud Section and
the Office pursue the prosecution that is deferred by this Agreement, BEAM agrees that it will
neither contest the admissibility of, nor contradict, this Statement of Facts in any such proceeding.
The following facts took place during the relevant time period and establish beyond a reasonable
doubt the charges set forth in the criminal Information attached to this Agreement:

Relevant Entities and Individuals

Chicago, Illinois. BEAM produces and sells distilled beverages, including bourbon whiskey,
tequila, Scotch whiskey, Irish whiskey, vodka, cognac, rum, cordials and pre-mixed cocktails.

BEAM products throughout India. During the relevant time period, Beam India was a wholly
owned subsidiary of BEAM and headquartered in Gurgaon, India. Beam Indiaâs financial
statements were consolidated into the financial statements of BEAM. Starting in January 2011,

3. âAPSA Executive 1,â an individual whose identity is known to the Fraud Section,
the Office, and the Company, was a high-ranking executive of BEAMâs APSA region from 2011

Overview of the Conspiracy and Bribery Scheme

9. The alcoholic beverage industry in India was highly regulated by government
authorities. Beam India, and third parties acting on its behalf, regularly interacted with government
officials in connection with Beam Indiaâs importation of distilled mixes for spirit products;
shipments to Beam Indiaâs bottling facility in Behror, Rajasthan; inspections of the Behror plant;
shipments from the facility in Behror to distribution warehouses in multiple states in India; label
registrations required to distribute each brand of liquor in each state; licensing of warehouses in

states prior to retail distribution; and sales to retail stores that were operated by the Indian

A-4
government. The introduction of new spirit products and distribution warehouses required
government approval of new label registrations and licensing of the warehouses in each state.
Label registrations and warehouse licenses also required yearly renewal in Rajasthan and in the 26
Indian states where Beam India sold BEAM products or had warehouses.

10. During the relevant period, BEAM, through its officers, employees, and agents,
knowingly and willfully conspired (1) to corruptly pay a bribe in the amount of one million Indian
Rupees (approximately $18,000 at the then exchange rate) to Foreign Official 1 with the intent to
obtain an improper advantage and in exchange for Foreign Official 1âs approval of a license to
bottle a new line of products that BEAM sought to market and sell in India; (2) to fail to implement
and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable
assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and preparation of financial statements
and that would have helped to detect and put an end to Beam Indiaâs practice of making improper
payments to government officials; and (3) to maintain false accounting records, by, among other
things, recording falsified expenses that were consolidated into BEAMâs books, records, and
accounts and by maintaining false Sarbanes-Oxley sub-certifications, in an effort to conceal the
improper payments made to Indian government officials.

11. | From the time BEAM acquired the Indian business in 2006 through the end of the
third quarter of 2012, Beam India paid bribes and made other improper payments to various Indian
government officials, including corrupt payments to obtain or retain business in the Indian market.
Most of the corrupt payments were made through third-party sales promoters and distributors, who
paid government officials to secure orders of BEAM products at government controlled depots

and retail stores, obtain prominent placement of BEAM products in government retail stores,

A-5
â or
F em OME OPE tae : Â¢

q out a de ee ae POT eS Fah Fee
QCA AL a ALS PA LUPE

acquire and renew label registrations and licenses, and enable the distribution of BEAM spirit
products from Beam Indiaâs Behror bottling facility to warehouses in other states throughout India.
The payments to government officials were made with the knowledge, authorization, and
complicity of Beam Indiaâs management, including Beam India Executive 1. One of those
payments, a bribe of one million Indian Rupees (approximately $18,000) to Foreign Official 1,
was authorized by APSA Executive 1 in connection with a project initiated and overseen by, and
for the benefit of, BEAM. BEAM profited from the illicit payment scheme at Beam India.

12. |The payments to government officials on Beam Indiaâs behalf were funded through
the submission of fictitious and/or inflated invoices to Beam India by the third parties. Senior
Beam India management directed the distribution of funds to those third parties in different
markets to make payments to government officials in those states. Certain Beam India finance
executives maintained off-the-books accounts that tracked amounts and uses of the funds provided
to the third parties. For example, during the relevant period, Beam India overpaid its third-party
sales promoter in the state of Delhi more than $550,000, and overpaid its third-party sales promoter
in the sales channel for the India militaryâs Canteen Stores Department (âCSDâ) more than $1.5
million; the promoters used those funds, in part, to make improper payments to government
officials at government-controlled retail stores and depots in those markets.

13. Before its acquisition by BEAM, the entity that subsequently became Beam India
also made corrupt payments, directly and indirectly, to Indian government officials, including to
secure and increase sales of spirit products and to facilitate distribution of the entityâs products.
When BEAM acquired the assets of the Indian entity, it also retained existing management of the

entity, which continued the schemes at Beam India without interruption from the 2006 acquisition

A-6
through the end of the third quarter of 2012. To conceal the scheme, Beam India management,
which included Beam India Executive 1, maintained a second set of financial records that tracked
the payments and disguised the scheme in the entityâs books and records to make it appear that the
illicit payments were legitimate business expenses.

14. _ During the relevant time period, in its official books and records, Beam India falsely
characterized the illicit payments made to government officials as legitimate business expenses,
including for âCustomer Support,â âOff-Trade Promotions,â âCommission _ to
Distributor/Promoter,â and âCommercial Discount, Ongoing,â which disguised the true nature of
these payments. Ultimately, the disguised expenses were consolidated in BEAMâs general ledger
system and coded as âSelling and Distribution Expenses.â

15. | Beam India management also submitted false certifications to BEAM regarding
Beam Indiaâs financial records, internal controls, and compliance with laws. As a wholly-owned
subsidiary of BEAM, Beam India was required to provide quarterly certifications, which included
certification by Beam India management that they were âaware of their obligations under the
[FCPA] and Anti-Bribery provisions.â Starting on or about October 4, 2011, when BEAM became
a publicly traded company, Beam India began providing sub-certifications to BEAM that BEAM
maintained in its books and records, and that BEAM management relied upon in certifying the
accuracy of the quarterly and annual financial statements that BEAM filed with the SEC, in
accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (âSarbanes-Oxleyâ). From at least October 2011
through in or around July 2012, Beam India management, including Beam India Executive 1,
submitted false Sarbanes-Oxley sub-certifications to BEAM. These false sub-certifications,

among other things, failed to report the direct and indirect payments to government officials and

failed to report the falsified expenses that were consolidated into BEAMâs books and records, even
though Beam India management knew about the improper payments and false records.

16. Notwithstanding multiple red flags regarding Beam Indiaâs practice of making
improper payments to government officials, BEAM knowingly and willfully failed to implement
and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls, including failing to implement
controls related to payments to third-parties in India, sufficient to provide reasonable assurances
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and preparation of financial statements. For
example, after being made aware of significant red flags indicating that Beam India was involved
in making improper payments, Beam Employee 1 sent an email to Beam India Executive 1 noting
an intention to approach an upcoming compliance review âwith the understanding that a U.S.
regulatory regime should not be imposedâ and in a way that would acknowledge âIndia customs
and ways of doing business.â

Bribe Payment To An India State Excise Official
(17. In 2011, Beam India sought to introduce BEAMâs profitable âReady to Drinkâ
(âRTDâ) products in India. At the time, BEAM had embarked on a broad global initiative to
develop RTD beverages in emerging markets and had targeted India as one of the markets where
it would introduce RTD. BEAM and APSA employees were involved in the rollout of RTD
products in India.

18. In or around May 2011, Beam India contracted with a third-party bottling company
to produce the RTD drinks. Beam Indiaâs third-party bottler then filed, on Beam Indiaâs behalf,
applications with the state Excise Ministry to obtain the label registrations required to operate the

facility and bottle RTD products in that state.
19. In or around September 2011, APSA management, including APSA Executive 1
and APSA Executive 2, learned that Foreign Official 1 had solicited a bribe in the amount of one
million Indian Rupees (approximately equal to $18,000 at the then exchange rate or to the officialâs
annual compensation) to approve the label registration for Beam India. Foreign Official 1 had the
discretion to deny the label registration application. A senior Beam India manager (âBeam India
Managerâ) informed a senior APSA manager in Australia (âAPSA Managerâ), who had been
selected by BEAM to implement the RTD rollout in India, of the bribe solicitation by Foreign
Official 1. In that capacity, APSA Manager was an agent of an issuer within the meaning of the
FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-1(a), on and after October 4, 2011, and was an
agent of a domestic concern within the meaning of the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section
78dd-2(a), before that date.

20. APSA Manager met with APSA Executive 1 and APSA Executive 2 in Sydney,
Australia, and informed them of the bribe solicitation. At this meeting, APSA Executive 1, APSA
Executive 2, and APSA Manager discussed the possibility of a third-party bottler making this
payment and how the payment could be concealed and reimbursed through the submission of false
invoices by the third-party bottler to Beam India. At the end of the meeting, APSA Executive 1
instructed APSA Manager to have the payment made to Foreign Official 1.

21. | APSA Manager informed Beam India Manager that he had discussed the matter
with APSA Executive 1, that the third-party bottler should make the payment to Foreign Official
1, and that Beam India would reimburse the third-party bottler for the amount of the payment
through false invoices. Beam India Manager relayed that information to Beam India Executive 1,

who told Beam India Manager to make the payment to Foreign Official 1 because it had been

A-9
ordered by APSA Executive 1. Beam Indiaâs third-party bottler agreed to make, and did make,
the unlawful payment of one million Rupees to Foreign Official 1.

22. Thereafter, on or about November 16, 2011, the Excise Ministry issued the approval
to begin bottling the RTD product. Several months later, the third-party bottler submitted false
invoices to Beam India, purportedly for consulting services at the bottling facility, in the total
approximate amount of the payment to Foreign Official 1, which Beam India paid.

Failure To Implement And Maintain Adequate Internal Controls

23. | BEAM also knowingly and willfully failed to implement and maintain an adequate
system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and preparation of financial statements and that would have helped
to detect and put an end to Beam Indiaâs practice of making improper payments to government
officials. BEAM was cautioned on numerous occasions regarding the need to implement sufficient
compliance measures and internal accounting controls relating to risks associated with improper
activities by third parties in India. Nevertheless, for several years, BEAM failed to adopt
significant recommended actions and failed to address the concerns those recommendations were
meant to alleviate.

24. Under the circumstances of BEAMâs acquisition of its Indian business, BEAM did
not conduct thorough due diligence on Beam India before it acquired that business in 2006. BEAM
conducted internal audits of the Indian business in or around 2008 and 2009, but those audits did
not focus on anti-corruption issues. The audits identified deficiencies in the accounting controls

in India and a lack of supporting documentation for credit notes, promotional expenses, and vendor

A-10
discounts. BEAM did not take steps sufficient to resolve these issues in Beam India until after the
fall of 2012.

25. In or around November 2010, BEAM engaged a global accounting firm to conduct
a compliance review of Beam India, which included transaction testing and interviews with
employees. In or around early January 2011, the accounting firm issued a report on its findings
that raised several red flags, including that Beam India did ânot have many anti-corruption
policiesâ and its employees had not received anticorruption training; Beam India management
believed Beam India was not liable from a compliance standpoint for the conduct of its vendors
and third-party sales promoters; Beam India management maintained it was âvery difficultâ to
conduct business in India without making âerease/facilitation payments,â while certain Beam India
employees believed that âpromoters are likely making grease paymentsâ to government officials
in India; certain vendors engaged by Beam India presented a significant risk of corruption; and
Beam India âd[id] not perform monitoring relative to corruption risks.â The report found that the
military-run CSD sales channel presented a âhigh risk area in terms of anti-corruption
compliance.â The global accounting firm recommended that BEAM âconduct and document due
diligence to confirm activities undertakenâ by third parties, âinvestigate red flags,â âdiscuss legal
considerations of third party actions taken on BEAMâs behalf,â and âconsider the need to further
reviewâ the CSD and other military outlet business in India. BEAM did not take these steps in
India at that time, and BEAM did not implement many of the global accounting firmâs
recommendations until fall 2012.

26.  Inor around January 2011, BEAM consulted a United States law firm (âU.S. Law

Firmâ), which advised that the issues identified by the global accounting firm required follow up.

A-11
BEAM did not take steps to enhance its controls in India regarding payments to third parties at this
time.

27. In or around February 2011, BEAM retained an Indian law firm (âIndian law firmâ)
to review and expand upon the compliance work performed by the accounting firm and to assess
Beam Indiaâs compliance with Indian laws and regulations applicable to the spirits industry. Beam
Employee 1 was tasked with managing the Indian law firmâs review of Beam Indiaâs business. At
that time, Beam Employee 1 did not have any experience with, and had not received any training
on, the FCPA or anti-corruption compliance issues.

28. In or around early February 2011, Beam Employee 1 and Beam Executive 1 had a
conference call with APSA Executive 1 and APSA Executive 2 to explain the upcoming review
by the Indian law firm. APSA Executive 1 and APSA Executive 2 expressed concern that, if the |
review uncovered improper activities by third parties, Beam India might have to stop doing
business with those third parties, which could disrupt the Indian business. An APSA executive
further stated at the meeting that if BEAM continued digging into the Indian business, it likely
would find improper activities.

29. Onor about February 4, 2011, Beam Employee 1 emailed Beam India Executive 1,
stating: âBeam Legal believes it is critical to approach a compliance review with the understanding
that a U.S. regulatory regime should not be imposed on our Indian business and that acknowledges
India customs and ways of doing business.â Beam Employee 1 discussed the messages conveyed
in this email, but not the exact wording, with Beam Executive 1 before it was sent.

30. The Indian law firm interviewed Beam India senior management to determine

whether improper payments were being made to Indian government officials. The Indian law firm

A-12
reported, among other things, that Beam India managers believed that third parties in India may
make payments to customs officials and government employees in the CSD channel. The Indian
law firm confirmed and reiterated many of the accounting firmâs recommendations, including the
need for Beam India employees to receive training on the FCPA and liability for third-party
conduct; to conduct due diligence on high-risk vendors; to create policies and implement
appropriate accounting controls for gifts, petty cash, and reimbursement claims; and to revise its
contracts with third parties to include anti-corruption clauses and audit rights.

31. BEAMasked U.S. Law Firm to review the report and work done by the Indian law
firm. On or about August 19, 2011, U.S. Law Firm issued a memorandum to Beam noting that no
significant analysis of Beam Indiaâs books and records, internal controls or other issues related to
its finance and accounting practices, and no substantial transaction testing, had been conducted by
the Indian law firm. The U.S. Law Firm memorandum also noted that the Indian law firm had
raised issues concerning BEAMâs oversight of third parties and the potential conduct of those third
parties. In addition to confirming the advice given by the accounting firm and the Indian law firm,
U.S. Law Firm made additional recommendations with respect to compliance and internal
accounting controls, including that BEAM âshould strongly consider undertaking a financial
review of past invoices and debit notes received from Beam Indiaâs third-party business partners
that interact with government officials.â Because it believed there was âa high likelihood that the
results of this type of financial review may uncover evidence of potentially improper payments,â
U.S. Law Firm recommended that BEAM âshould consider structuring the review so that in-house

>

or outside counsel engages an outside forensic investigator to conduct the review... .â

A-13
32. | BEAM did not conduct a further review of the Indian business or enhance its
internal accounting controls over payments to third parties at that time.

33. | Onor about August 30, 2011, Beam Employee 1 wrote to BEAM compliance and
finance personnel, copying APSA Executive 2, to discuss concluding the review in India, and
stated, in relevant part: âI would like to discuss with you the results of the legal compliance review
conducted by [the Indian law firm], as well as notes from [the U.S. Law Firm] with an eye toward
making this a case closed within the next four weeks.â

34. On or about August 31, 2011, Beam Employee 1 wrote to the Indian law firm,
copying APSA Executive 2 and others, stating, in relevant part: âAs Beam prepares to become a
listed company in one month, executive management directed me yesterday to ensure that the
compliance review in India come to a close before then.â Beam Employee 1 later added:
âCompliance review will be an ongoing process, but hopefully, upon completion of this legal
compliance review, Beam India will not have to undergo another compliance review by any
department for a long time.â

35. The Indian law firm recommended conducting additional interviews in India, this
time with Beam India operational employees who interacted with the third-party sales promoters
in the CSD channel. This recommendation was based on further conversations that the Indian law
firm had with Beam India management, which raised concerns about third-party sales promoters
in the CSD channel.

36. BEAM declined to follow the Indian law firmâs recommendation. Beam Employee
1 explained to APSA Executive 2 and others in a September 8, 2011 email, âI am concerned about

[the Indian law firm] digging and finding information that we cannot impact, specifically, finding

activities and practices by our [third parties] that we cannot remediate or change. The risk may be
ultimately having to choose whether to continue to conduct business with any [third parties] that
create [FCPA] risks for us/Beam India.â Later in the email, Beam Employee 1 referenced an SEC
enforcement matter concerning one of Beamâs competitors and noted that, if Beam was doing
anything in the same manner as the competitor, Beam should change and do things in a more
compliant manner. Beam Employee 1 noted further that it would be âbeneficialâ to conduct the
review âin houseâ and involve external advisors if they felt it necessary.
37. BEAM decided to conclude the review being conducted by the Indian law firm, and
did not conduct additional interviews in India until September 2012, after further allegations of
corrupt conduct in Beam India were raised. BEAM also knowingly and willfully failed to maintain
an adequate system of internal accounting controls, including failing to implement controls related
to payments to third-parties in India, sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and preparation of financial statements until at least September
2012.
False Books and Records
38. Asa result of the bribe paid to Foreign Official 1, and in order to conceal corrupt
payments made by and on behalf of Beam India, among other things, between at least on or about
October 4, 2011 and in or around September 2012, BEAM maintained falsely recorded expenses,
including corrupt payments concealed as commission expenses, and falsified certifications,
including false Sarbanes-Oxley sub-certifications submitted by APSA Executive 1, APSA

Executive 2, and Beam India Executive 1, in its consolidated books, records, and accounts.

A-15
ae
a

39. For example, between at least on or about October 19, 2011, and on or about July
18, 2012, APSA Executive 1 and APSA Executive 2 submitted Sarbanes-Oxley sub-certifications
that falsely stated, in sum and substance, that they had no knowledge of non-compliance with anti-
corruption laws and that they had no knowledge of any fraud or suspected fraud, whether or not
material, that involved management, other employees, or third parties who had a significant role
in the regionâs internal controls. These sub-certifications failed to disclose, among other things,
the one-million-Rupee bribe to Foreign Official 1 and the existence of false documents and

accounting records related to that payment.

ATTACHMENT C
CORPORATE COMPLIANCE PROGRAM

In order to address any deficiencies in its internal controls, compliance code, policies, and
procedures regarding compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (âFCPAâ), 15 U.S.C. Â§Â§
78dd-1, et seqg., and other applicable anti-corruption laws, Beam Suntory Inc. (the âCompanyâ),
on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries and affiliates, agrees to continue to conduct, in a manner
consistent with all of its obligations under this Agreement, appropriate reviews of its existing
internal controls, policies, and procedures.

Where necessary and appropriate, the Company agrees to adopt new, or to modify its
existing compliance programs, including internal controls, compliance policies, and procedures in
order to ensure that it maintains: (a) an effective system of internal accounting controls designed
to ensure the making and keeping of fair and accurate books, records, and accounts; and (b) a
rigorous anti-corruption compliance program that incorporates relevant internal accounting
controls, as well as policies and procedures designed to effectively detect and deter violations of
the ECPA and other applicable anti-corruption laws. At a minimum, this should include, but not
be limited to, the following elements to the extent they are not already part of the Companyâs
existing internal controls, compliance code, policies, and procedures:

Commitment to Compliance

1. The Company will ensure that its directors and senior management provide strong,
explicit, and visible support and commitment to its corporate policy against violations of the anti-
corruption laws and its compliance codes, and demonstrate rigorous adherence by example. The

Company will also ensure that middle management, in turn, reinforce those standards and

C-1
encourage employees to abide by them. The Company will create and foster a culture of ethics
and compliance with the law in its day-to-day operations at all levels of the company.
Policies and Procedures

2. The Company will develop and promulgate a clearly articulated and visible
corporate policy against violations of the FCPA and other applicable foreign law counterparts
(collectively, the âanti-corruption lawsâ), which policy shall be memorialized in a written
compliance code or codes.

3. The Company will develop and promulgate compliance policies and procedures
designed to reduce the prospect of violations of the anti-corruption laws and the Companyâs
compliance code, and the Company will take appropriate measures to encourage and support the
observance of ethics and compliance policies and procedures against violation of the anti-
corruption laws by personnel at all levels of the Company. These anti-corruption policies and
procedures shall apply to all directors, officers, and employees and, where necessary and
appropriate, outside parties acting on behalf of the Company in a foreign jurisdiction, including,
but not limited to, agents and intermediaries, consultants, representatives, distributors, teaming
partners, contractors and suppliers, consortia, and joint venture partners (collectively, âagents and
business partnersâ). The Company shall notify all employees that compliance with the policies

and procedures is the duty of individuals at all levels of the company. Such policies and procedures

shall address:
a. gifts;
b. hospitality, entertainment, and expenses;
C. customer travel;
d. political contributions;

â¬. charitable donations and sponsorships;
f. facilitation payments; and
g. solicitation and extortion.
4, The Company will ensure that it has a system of financial and accounting

procedures, including a system of internal controls, reasonably designed to ensure the maintenance
of fair and accurate books, records, and accounts. This system shall be designed to provide

reasonable assurances that:

a. transactions are executed in accordance with managementâs general or
specific authorization;
b. transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial

statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles or any other criteria
applicable to such statements, and to maintain accountability for assets;

c. access to assets is permitted only in accordance with managementâs general
or specific authorization; and

d. the recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets
at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences.

Periodic Risk-Based Review
5. The Company will develop these compliance policies and procedures on the basis

of a periodic risk assessment addressing the individual circumstances of the Company, in particular
the foreign bribery risks facing the Company, including, but not limited to, its geographical

organization, interactions with various types and levels of government officials, industrial sectors

C-3
of operation, potential clients and business partners, use of third parties, gifts, travel and
entertainment expenses, charitable and political donations, involvement in joint venture
arrangements, importance of licenses and permits in the Companyâs operations, degree of
governmental oversight and inspection, and volume and importance of goods and personnel
clearing through customs and immigration.

6. The Company shall review its anti-corruption compliance policies and procedures
no less than annually and update them as appropriate to ensure their continued effectiveness, taking
into account relevant developments in the field and evolving international and industry standards.

Proper Oversight and Independence

7. The Company will assign responsibility to one or more senior corporate executives
of the Company for the implementation and oversight of the Companyâs anti-corruption
compliance code, policies, and procedures. Such corporate official(s) shall have the authority to
report directly to independent monitoring bodies, including internal audit, the Companyâs Board
of Directors, or any appropriate committee of the Board of Directors, and shall have an adequate
level of stature and autonomy from management as well as sufficient resources and authority to
maintain such autonomy.

Training and Guidance

8. The Company will implement mechanisms designed to ensure that its anti-
corruption compliance code, policies, and procedures are effectively communicated to all
directors, officers, employees, and, where necessary and appropriate, agents and business partners.
These mechanisms shall include: (a) periodic training for all directors and officers, all employees

in positions of leadership or trust, positions that require such training (e.g., internal audit, sales,

C-4
legal, compliance, finance), or positions that otherwise pose a corruption risk to the Company,
and, where necessary and appropriate, agents and business partners; and (b) corresponding
certifications by all such directors, officers, employees, agents, and business partners, certifying
compliance with the training requirements. The Company will conduct training in a manner
tailored to the audienceâs size, sophistication, or subject matter expertise and, where appropriate,
will discuss prior compliance incidents.

9. | The Company will maintain, or where necessary establish, an effective system for
providing guidance and advice to directors, officers, employees, and, where necessary and
appropriate, agents and business partners, on complying with the Companyâs anti-corruption
compliance code, policies, and procedures, including when they need advice on an urgent basis or
in any foreign jurisdiction in which the Company operates.

Internal Reporting and Investigation

10. | The Company will maintain, or where necessary establish, an effective system for
internal and, where possible, confidential reporting by, and protection of, directors, officers,
employees, and, where appropriate, agents and business partners concerning violations of the anti-
corruption laws or the Companyâs anti-corruption compliance code, policies, and procedures.

11. | The Company will maintain, or where necessary establish, an effective and reliable
process with sufficient resources for responding to, investigating, and documenting allegations of
violations of the anti-corruption laws or the Companyâs anti-corruption compliance code, policies,
and procedures. The Company will handle the investigations of such complaints in an effective
manner, including routing the complaints to proper personnel, conducting timely and thorough

investigations, and following up with appropriate discipline where necessary.

Enforcement and Discipline

12. The Company will implement mechanisms designed to effectively enforce its
compliance code, policies, and procedures, including appropriately incentivizing compliance and
disciplining violations.

13. | The Company will institute appropriate disciplinary procedures to address, among
other things, violations of the anti-corruption laws and the Companyâs anti-corruption compliance
code, policies, and procedures by the Companyâs directors, officers, and employees. Such
procedures should be applied consi stently, fairly and in a manner commensurate with the violation,
regardless of the position held by, or perceived importance of, the director, officer, or employee.
The Company shall implement procedures to ensure that where misconduct is discovered,
reasonable steps are taken to remedy the harm resulting from such misconduct, and to ensure that
appropriate steps are taken to prevent further similar misconduct, including assessing the internal
controls, compliance code, policies, and procedures and making modifications necessary to ensure
the overall anti-corruption compliance program is effective.

Third-Party Relationships

14. | The Company will institute appropriate risk-based due diligence and compliance
requirements pertaining to the retention and oversight of all agents and business partners,
including:

a. properly documented due diligence pertaining to the hiring and appropriate

and regular oversight of agents and business partners;
b. informing agents and business partners of the Companyâs commitment to
abiding by anti-corruption laws, and of the Companyâs anti-corruption compliance code, policies,
and procedures; and

C. seeking a reciprocal commitment from agents and business partners. The
Company will understand and record the business rationale for using a third party in a transaction,
and will conduct adequate due diligence with respect to the risks posed by a third-party partner
such as a third-party partnerâs reputation and relationships, if any, with foreign officials. The
Company will ensure that contract terms with third parties specifically describe the services to be
performed, that the third party is actually performing the described work, and that its compensation
is commensurate with the work being provided in that industry and geographical region. The
Company will engage in ongoing monitoring of third-party relationships through updated due

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Tuesday, October 27, 2020

Beam Suntory Inc. Agrees to Pay Over $19 Million to Resolve Criminal Foreign Bribery Case

Beam Suntory Inc. (Beam), a Chicago-based company that produces and sells distilled beverages, has agreed to pay a criminal monetary
penalty of $19,572,885 to resolve the departmentâs investigation into violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).

The resolution arises in part out of Beamâs scheme to pay a bribe to an Indian government official in exchange for approval of a license to bottle
a line of products that Beam sought to market and sell in India, and related internal controls and books and records violations, which included
efforts by a then-member of Beamâs legal department to affirmatively avoid uncovering information related to improper activities and practices
by third-parties engaged by Beam in India that presented corruption risks.

Beam entered into a three-year deferred prosecution agreement with the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the
Northern District of Illinois in connection with a criminal information unsealed today in the Northern District of Illinois charging Beam with one
count of conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery, internal controls, and books and records provisions of the FCPA.

âBeam and its Indian subsidiary not only paid bribes to Indian government officials, they intentionally failed to implement internal controls to
prevent bribery and falsified their books and records to conceal the corrupt activity,â said Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian C. Rabbitt of
the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division. âCompanies that use corrupt influence instead of competing in a fair, ethical, and honest manner
should take note of todayâs agreement: paying bribes to obtain and retain business is not business as usual, it is a crime.â

âU.S. companies that attempt to gain the upper hand in foreign business ventures by engaging in corruption must be held accountable,â said
U.S. Attorney John R. Lausch Jr. for the Northern District of Illinois. âThe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act has a long reach, and for good reason. It
is critical that our global economy remain on a fair playing field.â

âBribery undermines the public's trust in our markets, and the FBI will never stop fighting to hold corrupt companies accountable whenever and
wherever they abuse that trust,â said Special Agent in Charge Emmerson Buie Jr. of the FBIâs Chicago Office.

According to its admissions, Beam conspired with others to violate the FCPA by, among other things, engaging in a scheme to pay a bribe of one
million Indian Rupees (approximately equal to $18,000 at the then exchange rate) to a senior Indian government official in exchange for that
officialâs approval of a license to bottle âReady-to-Drinkâ (RTD) products that Beam sought to market and sell in India through its subsidiary,
Beam Global Spirits & Wine (India) Private Ltd. (Beam India). The bribe was authorized by a high-ranking executive at Beamâs Asia Pacific/South
America regional business unit, who directed that the payment be made through Beam Indiaâs third-party bottler in order to conceal it.

According to its admissions, from the time Beam acquired the Indian business in 2006 through the end of the third quarter of 2012, Beam India
paid bribes and made other improper payments to various Indian government officials, including corrupt payments to obtain or retain business
in the Indian market. Most of the corrupt payments were made through third-party sales promoters and distributors, who paid government
officials to secure orders of Beam products at government controlled depots and retail stores, obtain prominent placement of Beam products in
government retail stores, acquire and renew label registrations and licenses, and enable the distribution of Beam spirit products from Beam
Indiaâs Behror bottling facility to warehouses in other states throughout India.

As part of the conspiracy, Beam also agreed with others to fail to implement and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls,
which would have helped to detect and halt Beam Indiaâs longstanding practice of making corrupt payments to Indian government officials, and
to falsify its books and records. On numerous occasions, Beam was cautioned by outside advisors regarding the need to implement sufficient
internal accounting controls relating to risks associated with improper activities by third parties in India, but Beam failed to implement sufficient
controls. Beam also maintained falsely recorded expenses, including corrupt payments concealed as commission expenses, and falsified
certifications, including false sub-certification letters submitted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, in its consolidated books, records, and
accounts.

As part of the deferred prosecution agreement, Beam agreed to continue to cooperate with the department in any ongoing or future criminal
investigations concerning Beam, its executives, employees, or agents. In addition, under the agreement, Beam agreed to enhance its
compliance program and to report to the government on the implementation of its enhanced compliance program.

The government reached this resolution with Beam based on a number of factors, including the failure to timely disclose the conduct that
triggered the investigation; the nature and seriousness of the offense, including the involvement of a then-executive officer of Beam, a then-
high-level employee in Beamâs Legal Department, and a then-high-level executive at Beam India; the lack of an effective compliance program
at the time of the misconduct; the companyâs failure to fully cooperate, including positions taken by Beam that were not consistent with full
cooperation, as well as significant delays caused by Beam in reaching a timely resolution and its refusal to accept responsibility for several
years; and Beamâs failure to fully remediate, including its failure to discipline certain individuals involved in the conduct.

The criminal monetary penalty for Beam reflects a 10 percent reduction off the bottom of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines fine range because
Beam received partial credit for its remediation and cooperation with the governmentâs investigation.

In July 2018, in a related matter with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Beam agreed to pay the SEC disgorgement and
prejudgment interest totaling approximately $6 million and a civil monetary penalty of $2 million but the department is not crediting any
portion of the penalty paid to the SEC because Beam did not seek to coordinate a parallel resolution with the department.
The FBI's Chicago Office investigated the case. Trial Attorneys John-Alex Romano and Della Sentilles of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section
and Assistant U.S. Attorney Tyler C. Murray of the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Northern District of Illinois are prosecuting the case.

The Justice Departmentâs Office of International Affairs provided significant assistance in this case.

The Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice Departmentâs FCPA
enforcement efforts can be found at www.justice.gov/criminal-fraud/foreign-corrupt-practices-act.

Case 1:19-cr-O0165-KMW Document i

 

JO3A7/19 Page 7 of 36

Â¢

$420 million in bribes in order to conduct business in Uzbekistan. As described further below,
the bribes were funneled by MTS and Uzdunrobita to KARIMOVA in various ways, including
through business transactions that were made to appear legitimate on their face. In furtherance
of the corrupt scheme, AKHMEDOV and KARIMOVA caused numerous payments to be made
and laundered through multiple bank accounts held in the names of shell companies, including
certain companies controlled by KARIMOVA. Many of the corrupt transactions were routed

order to promote the ongoing bribery scheme and to conceal the proceeds of that scheme.

Company, KARIMOVA used her influence as an Uzbek government official to facilitate

Uzbekistan. In or about November 2001, KARIMOVA, AKHMEDOV, Associate A, and
representatives of the American Company met in Dubai. At the meeting, KARIMOVA
threatened to cause problems for Uzdunrobita if the American Company did not give
KARIMOVA a 20% stake in Uzdunrobita at no cost to KARIMOVA. KARIMOVA stated that
if KARIMOVA received a stake in Uzdunrobita, then she would obtain a telecommunications
license for Uzdunrobita and provide Uzdunrobita with access to official currency exchange in
Uzbekistan, which would be a significant benefit to the American Company. Subsequently, the
American Company gave a 20% stake in Uzdunrobita to Shell Company A, which executives at

the American Company understood was beneficially owned by KARIMOVA, at no cost.

23,  Inor about early 2002, Uzdunrobita announced that Shell Company A was anew
shareholder and that AKHMEDOV would be Uzdunrobitaâs General Director. With
KARIMOVAâs corrupt assistance, Uzdunrobita obtained a telecommunications license without
going through the official auction process and gained access to official currency exchange in
Uzbekistan. In or about March 2002, KARIMOVA used her corrupt influence to cause
Uzdunrobitaâs other shareholder, the Uzbek government, to cede 31.4% of its stake in
Uzdunrobita to Shell Company A, which was controlled by KARIMOVA, and 10% of its stake
to the American Company for free, which made Shell Company A the majority shareholder of
Uzdunrobita. As a false cover story to conceal the bribe, Shell Company A agreed to provide
purported consulting services and infrastructure to Uzdunrobita as part of the deal. In truth and
in fact, Shell Company A provided no such services.

24.  Jnor about 2004, MTS sought to enter the Uzbek telecommunications market by
acquiring Uzdunrobita. In connection with the Uzdunrobita transaction, MTS paid a $100
million bribe to KARIMOVA. At the time, AKHMEDOV and certain MTS management knew
that Uzdunrobitaâs majority shareholder, Shell Company B, was also beneficially owned by
KARIMOVA. In or about 2003, Shell Company A changed its name and transferred its 51.4%
stake in Uzdunrobita to Shell Company B. In or about July 2004, AKHMEDOV caused MTS to
acquire a 33% stake in Uzdunrobita from Shell Company B, and a 41% stake in Uzdunrobita
from the American Company. As a means of funneling a lucrative bribe payment to
KARIMOVA, AKHMEDOV caused MTS to pay Shell Company B approximately six times as
much per share as MTS paid to the American Company, even though the shares were identical.
Around the same time, MTS and Shell Company B also entered into a Put and Call Option

Agreement (the âOption Agreementâ) pursuant to which MTS had the option to buy, and Shell

Company B had the option to sell, Shell Company Bâs remaining 26% stake in Uzdunrobita for
the fixed price of $37.7 million plus interest during the next three years.

25. Onor about July 26, 2004, MTSâs Board of Directors retroactively approved the
previously executed agreements between MTS and Shell Company B and the American
Company in violation of MTS policies that required Board apptoval before contracts of that
amount were signed. On or about July 29, 2004, MTS transferred approximately $100 million to
an escrow account for the benefit of Shell Company B. On or about August 2, 2004,
KARIMOVA, AKHMEDOV, certain MTS management, executives from the American.
Company, and others attended a deal closing ceremony for MTSâs acquisition of Uzdunrobita.
KARIMOVA presided over the meeting and signed the meeting minutes. On or about August 9,
2004, the escrow agent transferred the approximately $100 million bribe from the escrow
account to Shell Company Bâs bank account in Riga, Latvia, through transactions into and out of
correspondent bank accounts at financial institutions in New York, New York.

26. In or about 2006, KARIMOVA demanded another bribe from MTS through
AKHMEDOV. KARIMOVA told AKHMEDOV, in sum and substance, that she wanted MTS
to pay a higher price for Shell Company Bâs remaining stake in Uzdunrobita than contemplated
under the original Option Agreement. Accordingly, in or about August 2006, KARIMOVA,
AKHMEDOV, and certain MTS management negotiated an amendment to the Option
Agreement as a mechanism for funneling another bribe payment to KARIMOVA. On or about
August 17, 2006, MTS entered into a new agreement with Shell Company B that amended the
terms of the Option Agreement (the âAmended Option Agreementâ). The Amended Option
Agreement eliminated MTSâs call option, extended the time period for Shell Company Bâs put

option, removed the fixed exercise price of $37.7 million plus interest, and instead allowed the

value to be determined by an. international investment bank. Because Uzdunrobitaâs value had.
increased significantly since 2004, in part due to KARIMOVAâs influence, AKHMEDOV and
certain MTS management understood that the Amended Option Agreement conferred significant
corrupt financial benefits to KARIMOVA and did not benefit MTS.

27. On or about April 2, 2007, at least in part due to KARIMOVAâs influence,
UzACI granted Uzdunrobita licenses for additional telecommunications frequencies in
Uzbekistan.

28. On or about April 12, 2007, KARIMOVA and AKHMEDOV caused Shell
Company B to send notice to MTS of Shell Company Bâs intention to exercise its option under
the Amended Option Agreement, and thereby secure the bribe payment for KARIMOVA. On or
about April 27, 2607, MTS and Shell Company B jointly engaged an investment bank to value
Shell Company Bâs remaining share of Uzdunrobita. The bank estimated that 26% of
Uzdunrobita was worth approximately $250 million, including the value of licenses for certain
additional frequencies that UzACI granted to Uzdunrobita in or about April 2007 as a result of
KARIMOVAâs influence. On or about June 26, 2007, MTSâs Board of Directors approved a
$250 million payment to Shell Company B. On or about June 28, 2007, MTS transferred a bribe
of approximately $250 million to Shell Company Bâs bank account in Hong Kong through
transactions into and out of correspondent bank accounts at financial institutions in New York,
New York.

29. Jnor about February 2008, KARIMOVA sought additional bribes from MTS and
Uzdunrobita. Among other things, KARIMOVA demanded that Uzdunrobita extend various
purported loans to KARIMOVA to buy a majority stake in a bank, On or about February i,

2008, an Uzdunrobita executive emailed certain members of MTS and Uzdunrobita

management, including AKHMEDOV and MTS Executive 1, a proposal to have Uzdunrobita
extend loans totaling over $113 million to counterparties controlled by KARIMOVA. When
MTS did not agree to extend the purported loans, KARIMOVA demanded millions of dollars in
additional bribes from AKHMEDOV, MTS, and Uzdunrobita and threatened to interfere with
Uzdunrobitaâs operations in Uzbekistan if the bribes were not paid.

30. In or about the summer and fall of 2008, AKHMEDOV and certain MTS
management arranged to pay an additional $30 million in bribes to KARIMOVA by arranging
for a subsidiary of MTS to enter into a sham contract with Shell Company C, whose beneficial
ownerâas AKHMEDOV and certain MTS management knewâwas KARIMOVA. Under the
contract, an MTS subsidiary agreed to pay Shell Company C a total of approximately $30
million in exchange for a subsidiary of Shell Company Câs repudiation of its ownership of
telecommunications frequencies and the reassignment of those frequencies to Uzdunrobita by
UzACI. On or about August 21, 2008, the MTS subsidiary and Shell Company C executed the
sham contract. Four days later, UzACI issued an order reallocating the frequencies held by Shell
Company Câs subsidiary to Uzdunrobita. On or about September 5, 2008, MTS entered into a
$30 million loan agreement with its subsidiary to fund the agreement between the MTS
subsidiary and Shell Company C. Then, on or about the following dates, MTS or its subsidiary
paid the following bribes, totaling approximately $30 million, to KARIMOVA through Shell
Company Câs bank accounts, which were processed through transactions into and out of

correspondent bank accounts at financial institutions in New York, New York:

31.  Inor about late 2008 and early 2009, certain MTS management, including
AKHMEDOV and MTS Executive 1, discussed the possible acquisition of KOLORIT, an Uzbek
advertising company, as a mechanism by which MTS and Uzdunrobita could funnel additional
bribes to KARIMOVA. At the time, KOLORIT was nominally owned, in part, by a company
affiliated with Associate C, but in reality was owned and controlled by KARIMOVA. On or
about August 7, 2009, certain MTS management received a memo from MTSâs Department of
Strategic Planning recommending rejection of the KOLORIT acquisition because the acquisition
âwas not part of MTSâs âcore businessâ and the estimate for advertising market development was
ânot realistic.â Multiple internal MTS and external valuations of KOLORIT were significantly
less than the recommended purchase price. Nevertheless, in or about August 2009, certain MTS
management, including MTS Executive 1 and AKHMEDOV, approved MTSâs acquisition of
KOLORIT in order to facilitate a bribe payment to KARIMOVA. On or about September 22,
2009, Uzdunrobita funneled the bribe to KARIMOVA by paying the nominal shareholders of
KOLORIT approximately 59.375 billion Uzbek som, or approximately $39,636,711, for the
shares of KOLORIT. On or about September 29, 2009, an MTS subsidiary transferred $17,000
to the account of the company affiliated with Associate C in Uzbekistan, through transactions
into and out of correspondent bank accounts at financial institutions in New York, New York.

32. In or about 2012, KARIMOVA solicited additional bribes from MTS and
Uzdunrobita through AKHMEDOV. Between in or about March 2012 and May 2012,

AKHMEDOV caused Uzdunrobita to pay at least 2.2 billion Uzbek som, or approximately $1.1

12
Case 1:19-cr-00165-KMW Document 1

 

Flied OG/O7/19 Page 13 of 36

million, to purported charities or as sponsorship payments for the benefit of KARIMOVA.
AKHMEDOV caused Uzdunrobita to make these corrupt payments in violation of MTSâs
internal control procedures that required preapproval of such payments.
The VimpelCom and Unitel Bribes

33, From in or about 2005 through in or about 2012, AKHMEDOV conspired with
others to pay more than $114 million in bribes to KARIMOVA in exchange for KARIMOVA
exercising her influence over UzACI to permit VimpelCom and Unitel to operate in
Uzbekistanâs telecommunications market. AKIHMEDOV and others solicited and facilitated
bribe payments to KARIMOVA by certain VimpelCom and Unitel management so that
VimpelCom and Unitel could continue to obtain necessary UzACl approvals to obtain Uzbek
telecommunications business. AKHMEDOV, VimpelCom Executive 1, VimpelCom Executive
2, and others understood that they had to pay KARIMOVA millions of dollars in bribes for
VimpelCom and Unitel to continue to do business in Uzbekistan. In addition, AKHMEDOV
understood that he had to solicit bribe payments from VimmpelCom and. Unitel to benefit
KARIMOVA to ensure that KARIMOVA continued to allow MTS and Uzdunrobita to do
business in Uzbekistan. In furtherance of the scheme, certain co-conspirators used U.S.-based
email accounts to communicate with each other and other individuals. AKHMEDOV and
KARIMOVA caused numerous corrupt payments to be made and laundered through shell
company accounts, with many financial transactions routed into and out of correspondent bank
accounts at financial institutions in New York, New York, in order to promote the ongoing
bribery scheme and conceal the proceeds of that scheme.

34,  Inor about 2005, as part of a plan of expansion into the CIS region, VimpelCom

sought to acquire an Uzbek telecommunications company. VimpelCom considered acquiring

13

Flied OG/O7/19 Page 14 of 36

'

two companies: Unitel, the second largest operator in Uzbekistan with approximately 300,000
subscribers; and Buztel, which was a much smaller operator with only approximately 2,500
subscribers. Certain VimpelCom directors and management knew that KARIMOVA held an
indirect interest in Buztel and that acquiring Buztel would ensure KARIMOVAâs support for
VimpelComâs entry into the Uzbek telecommunications market. VimpelCom, through its
subsidiaries, purchased Buztel for approximately $60 million on or about January 18, 2006, and
Unite! for approximately $200 million, along with the assumption of some debt, on or about
February 10, 2006.

35. In connection with VimpelComâs acquisition of Buztel and Unitel, KARIMOVA
solicited bribe payments, through AKHMEDOYV, from VimpelCom in exchange for
KARIMOVAâs support for VimpelComâs entry into the Uzbek market. In an effort to conceal
the bribery scheme, KARIMOVA and AKHMEDOV used Shell Company C as the recipient of
the VimpelCom bribe payments for KARIMOVA. To mask KARIMOVAâs ownership of Shell
Company C, KARIMOVA used other individuals to act as nominee owners and shareholders of
Shell Company C, although in reality, KARIMOVA retained full ownership and control over
Shell Company C. For example, KARIMOVA caused Associate C to hold shares âon trust forâ
KARIMOVA and to grant an âirrevocableâ power of attorney to KARIMOVA for Shell
Company C. |

36. In connection with VimpelComâs acquisition of Unitel and Buztel, AKHMEDOV
arranged for VimpelCom to enter into a partnership with Shell Company C, which certain
VimpelCom management knew was ultimately owned and controlled by KARIMOVA.
KARIMOVA, AKHMEDOV, and certain VimpelCom management structured the partnership

agreement to conceal the bribe payments to KARIMOVA. More specifically, Shell Company C

14
Case 1:19-cr-00165-KMW Document 1

 

Flied OG/O7/19 Page 15 of 36

obtained an indirect interest of approximately 7% in Unitel for $20 million, and Shell Company
C received an option to sell its shares back to Unitel in 2009 for between $57.5 million and $60
million, for a guaranteed net profit of at least $37.5 million. Certain VimpelCom management
justified the option agreementâwhich provided no legitimate financial benefit to VimpelCom
and a significant financial benefit to KARIMOVAâby explaining, in board meeting materials,
that their âpartner,â ie., KARIMOVA, would assist with the â[rJevision of the licensing
agreement for the major licensesâ and âtransfer of frequencies,â while acknowledging that the
direct transfer of frequencies between legal entities was generally not allowed under Uzbek law.

37.  Onor about March 28, 2007, VimpelComâs board unanimously approved the
partnership agreement with Shell Company C. On or about June 12, 2007, Shell Company C
transferred $20 million from its Latvian bank account to VimpelComâs bank account. In or
about September 2009, Shell Company C exercised its guaranteed option to have VimpelComâs
subsidiary repurchase Shell Company Câs shares, and VimpelCom transferred $57.5 million
from its bank account to Shell Company Câs bank account in Hong Kong. Both transfers were
executed through transactions into and out of correspondent bank accounts at financial
institutions in New York, New York. .

38.  Inor about 2007, AKHMEDOV conspired with certain members of
VimpelComâs management to pay KARIMOVA, through Shell Company C, an additional $25
million bribe to obtain 3G frequencies from UzACT for Unitel in Uzbekistan. AKHMEDOV
negotiated with certain VimpelCom management to arrange for the transfer of the 3G licenses
through a sham contract with Shell Company C in order to conceal the corrupt payment to
KARIMOVA. In exchange for the $25 million bribe payment, VimpelCom and Unitel obtained

an amended license within a matter of days, which permitted Unitel to use the 3G frequencies.

15
Case 1:19-cr-00165-KMW Document 1

 

Flied OG/O7/19 Page 16 of 36

AKHIMEDOV served as a go-between for VimpelCom and Unitel management and government
regulators, including a high-ranking official at UzACI, to help close the deal. On or about
November 7, 2007, a VimpelCom subsidiary transferred $10 million from its Netherlands bank
account to Shell Company Câs Latvian bank account. On or about November 9, 2007, a
VimpelCom subsidiary transferred the remaining $15 million from its Netherlands bank account
to Shell Company Câs Latvian bank account, fulfilling VimpelComâs bribe payment to
KARIMOVA. The corrupt payments from the VimpelCom subsidiary to Shell Company Câs
bank account in Riga, Latvia, were executed through transactions into and out of correspondent
bank accounts at financial institutions in New York, New York.

39, In or about 2008, AKHMEDOV agreed with certain VimpelCom management to
pay an additional $2 million bribe to KARIMOVA through a sham consulting agreement with
Shell Company C. On or about February 13, 2008, a VimpelCom executive emailed certain
VimpelCom management to explain that âthe partner fie, KARIMOVA\, citing the earlier
verbal agreements, is returning to the issue [of $2 million] and is asking us to recognize the
obligations and make payments.â Certain VimpelCom management consulted with
AKHMEDOV in order to create fake documents that would contain purported services Shell
Company C could perform under a consulting agreement. Additional aspects of the consulting
arrangement demonstrated its sham nature. For example, at AKHMEDOVâs request,
VimpelCom, not Shell Company C, drafted Shell Company Câs invoice for the work that Shell
Company C purportedly performed, and VimpelCom, not Shell Company C, drafted Shell
Company Câs service acceptance act. In addition, both documents were backdated to July 18,
2008, and the final executed version of the consulting agreement between VimpelCom and Shell

Company C was backdated to June 30, 2008. The final documents, thus, made it falsely appear

16
Case 1:19-cr-00165-KMW Document 1

 

ecogio7/ig Page 17 of 36

4

that Shell Company C had performed $2 million of purported consulting work for VimpelCom in
only 18 days. In fact, Shell Company C did no legitimate work to justify the $2 million bribe
payment. On or about August 8, 2008, VimpelCom transferred $2 million from its bank account
to Shell Company Câs bank account in Riga, Latvia, which was executed through transactions
into and out of correspondent bank accounts at financial institutions in New York, New York.

40. In or about 2011, VimpelCom paid an additional $10 million bribe through
AKHEMEDOV to KARIMOVA through âresellerâ companies. Because of significant currency
conversion restrictions in Uzbekistan and the inability to use Uzbek som (the Uzbek unit of
currency) to obtain necessary foreign goods, Unitel frequently entered into non-transparent
transactions with purported âresellerâ companies to pay foreign vendors in hard currency for the
provision of goods in Uzbekistan. Typically, Unitel would contract with a local Uzbek company
in Uzbek som, and that Uzbek companyâs related companies located outside of Uzbekistan
would agree to pay an end supplier using the hard currency (usually, U.S. dollars). In or about
February and March 2011, AKHMEDOV agreed with VimpelCom Executive 1, VimpelCom
Executive 2, and others to take advantage of the murky reseller process to conceal a $10 million
bribe to KARIMOVA through various purported reseller transactions. To effectuate the corrupt
payment, Unitel entered into contracts with an Uzbek entity for services that were unnecessary
and/or at highly inflated prices. These transactions were approved without sufficient justification
and bypassed the normal competitive tender processes. Unitel then made payments in Uzbek
som to the Uzbek company. Thereafter, an offshore company affiliated with the Uzbek company
sent approximately 14 payments totaling $10.5 million to another intermediary, which in turn
sent approximately 14 wire payments, each under $1 million and totaling approximately

$10,000,023, to Shell Company Câs Swiss bank account. These wire transfers were executed

17
Case 1:19-cr-00165-KMW Document 1

 

ec ogio7v/ig Page 18 of 36

through transactions into and out of correspondent bank accounts at financial institutions in New
York, New York. Shell Company C performed no legitimate services to justify the $10 million
in payments, which, instead, were simply bribes for KARIMOVA.

41. Inor about 2011, AKHMEDOV agreed with VimpelCom Executive 1,
VimpelCom Executive 2, and others to funnel an additional $30 million bribe payment to
KARIMOVA through Shell Company C. While the purported purpose of the payment was to
acquire 4G mobile communication frequencies for Unitel, the real purpose of the payment was
to enable Unitel to continue to operate in the Uzbek telecommunications market without any
interference by KARIMOVA. AKHMEDOV, VimpelCom Executive 1, VimpelCom Executive
2, and others modeled the 2011 4G agreement on VimpelComâs 3G agreement in 2007, except
that the 2011 4G agreement purportedly was for consulting services and full payment was not
contingent on obtaining the 4G frequencies. At the time, Unitel had no need for 4G frequencies
because Unitel lacked the ability to employ 4G frequencies in Uzbekistan. Certain VimpelCom
management knew that the 4G consulting agreement was a sham and that Shell Company C
would not provide any actual services in return for the $30 million payment. On or about
September 21, 2011, a VimpelCom subsidiary transferred $20 million as an advance payment
under the 4G consulting agreement to Shell Company Câs Swiss bank account. On or about
October 18, 2011, UzACI issued a decision amending Unitelâs license to allow it to use 4G
frequencies. The following day, on or about October 19, 2011, the VimpelCom subsidiary sent
the final $10 million payment to Shell Company Câs Swiss bank account. The corrupt payments
from the VimpelCom subsidiary to Shell Company Câs Swiss bank account were executed
through transactions into and out of correspondent bank accounts at financial institutions in New

York, New York. Shell Company C never provided any legitimate consulting services to Unitel

18
Case 1:19-cr-00165-KMW Document 1

 

Page 19 of 36

4

to justify the $30 million in payments. In fact, Shell Company Câs consulting reports and
presentations that were prepared under the consulting agreement were not needed by
VimpelCom or Unitel and were largely plagiarized from Wikipedia entries, other internet
sources, and internal VimpelCom documents.

42. nor about 2012, AAHMEDOV agreed with VimpelCom Executive 1,
VimpelCom Executive 2, and others to make another $10 million in bribe payments to
KARIMOVA via Shell Company C through purported transactions with âresellerâ companies.
As in 2011, AXHMEDOV, VimpelCom Executive 1, and VimpelCom Executive 2, knew that
the true purpose of these transactions was to funnel $10 million in corrupt bribes to Shel!
Company C. Between in or about February and May 2012, Unitel entered into contracts, this
time with multiple Uzbek entities for services that were unnecessary and/or at highly inflated
prices. These transactions again were approved without sufficient justification and bypassed the
normal competitive tender processes. Unitel made payments in Uzbek som to those Uzbek
companies. AKHMEDOV then arranged for approximately 13 bribe payments, each under $1
million and totaling approximately $10 million, to be funneled through the âresellerâ companies

_to Shell Company Câs Swiss bank account. These wire transfers were executed through
transactions into and out of correspondent bank accounts at financial institutions in New York,
New York. As in 2011, VimpelCom and Unitel, through VimpelCom Executive 1, VimpelCom
Executive 2, and others, used these reseller transactions to funnel and conceal the $10 million in
bribes to KARIMOVA through Shell Company C. Shell Company C performed no legitimate

services to justify the $10 million in payments.

The Telia and Coscom Bribes

43. From in or about 2007 through in or about 2010, AKHMEDOV conspired with
others to pay approximately $331.2 million in bribes to KARIMOVA in exchange for
KARIMOVA exercising her influence over UzACI to allow Telia to enter and expand Coscomâs
share of the Uzbek telecommunications market. AKHMEDOV solicited and facilitated bribe
payments by certain Telia and Coscom management so that Telia and Coscom could continue to
obtain necessary UzACI approvals and be allowed to obtain and retain Uzbek
telecommunications business. AKHMEDOV, Telia Executive 1, and others understood that they
had to regularly pay KARIMOVA millions of dollars in bribes in order to continue to do
business in Uzbekistan. In addition, AKHMEDOV understood that he had to regularly solicit
bribe payments from Telia and Coscom to benefit KARIMOVA to ensure that KARIMOVA
continued to allow MTS and Uzdunrobita to do business in Uzbekistan. In furtherance of the
bribery scheme, certain co-conspirators used U.S.-based email accounts to communicate with
each other and other individuals to further the scheme. AKHMEDOV and KARIMOVA caused
numerous corrupt payments to be made and laundered through multiple shell company accounts,
with many financial transactions routed into and out of correspondent bank accounts at financial
institutions in New York, New York, in order to promote the ongoing bribery scheme and
conceal the proceeds of that scheme.

44. In or about 2006, Telia sought to acquire a telecommunications company
operating in Uzbekistan. Telia Executive | and certain other Telia management decided to
acquire a U.S.-based telecommunications company that was the parent company of Coscom,
which was already operating in Uzbekistan. After several months of negotiations facilitated by

AKHMEDOV, on or about July 3, 2007, Teliaâs board of directors agreed to acquire Coscom

20
Case 1:19-cr-00165-KMW Document 1

 

Flied OG/O7/19 Page 21 of 36

through a wholly owned subsidiary of Telia for approximately $410 million plus $30 million for
the acquisition of additional assets in Uzbekistan.

45.  Onor about July 4, 2007, Telia Executive 1, signed a partnership agreement on
behalf of Sonera Hungary Holding B.V. (ater renamed. TeliaSonera UTA Holding B.V.), a Telia
subsidiary, with âthe Uzbek Partner,â who was defined in the agreement as AKHMEDOV âor
his nominee.â Telia Executive 1 and other Telia management understood that AKHMEDOV
was acting on behalf of KARIMOVA. The partnership agreement set forth basic terms that later
would be formalized as part of a Shareholders Agreement in December 2007, including that the
Uzbek Partner would receive a net balance of $30 million and shares of Telia Uzbek, the 99.97%
owner of Coscom, with the option to sell the shares back to Telia UTA at a substantial profit for
KARIMOVA. On or about July 16, 2007, Telia completed its acquisition of Coscom through
payments and transfer of ownership.

46. nexchange for KARIMOVA and AKHMEDOVâs support for Teliaâs entry into
the Uzbek telecommunications market through Coscom, KARIMOVA, through AKHMEDOV,
solicited bribe payments from Telia. In or about August 2007 Telia Executive 1 and other Telia
management ordered a Coscom executive to make a corrupt, cash payment of approximately $2
million directly to AKHMEDOV in the lobby of a hotel in Tashkent, Uzbekistan.

47.  Inor about late 2007, Telia arranged, through AKHMEDOYV, the $30 million
bribe to KARIMOVA. On or about November 21, 2007, AKHMEDOV emailed Telia Executive
1 and other Telia management with a proposed payment structure for a bribe based on the
mechanism previously employed by AKHMEDOV on behalf of MTS and VimpelCom.
Specifically, AKHMEDOV arranged a series of sham transactions involving Telia UTA and

Shell Company C, which resulted in KARIMOVAâs receipt of the $30 million bribe payment, an

21
Case 1:19-cr-00165-KMW Document 1

 

indirect 26% ownership interest in Coscom at no cost, and a put option to obtain a much larger
payment at a later date at no cost. That option was a significant benefit to KARIMOVA, but
provided Telia with no legitimate financial benefit.

48.  Inor about 2008, Telia paid an additional $9.2 million in bribes to KARIMOVA
through AKHMEDOV. After AKHMEDOV and Telia management finalized the agreement
with Sheil Company C, certain Telia management traveled to Tashkent to meet with certain
Coscom management and Uzbek government officials between January 6 and 11, 2008.
KARIMOVA met with certain Telia management during their trip to Tashkent. In the summer
of 2008, AKHMEDOV negotiated the bribe for KARIMOVA with certain Telia management,
including Telia Executive 1, which ultimately resulted in a $9.2 million corrupt payment to
KARIMOVA through Shell Company C. The payment purportedly was for Coscom to acquire a
number series of one million telephone numbers and a network code. On or about September 15,
2008, certain Telia management, including Telia Executive 1, received and approved a memo
seeking authorization to execute the agreement with Shell Company C. On ot about September
16, 2008, Telia Uzbek transferred $9.2 million to Shell Company Câs bank account in Riga,
Latvia, through transactions into and out of correspondent bank accounts at financial institutions
in New York, New York.

49, The December 2007 Shareholders Agreement granted Shell Company C the right
to sell back shares of Coscom to Telia UTA after December 31, 2009. On or about January 18,
2010, certain Telia management, including Telia Executive 1, drafted and sent a memorandum to
the Telia board of directors seeking approval to purchase 20% of Shell Company Câs indirect
26% ownership interest for a price not to exceed $220 million. On or about January 25, 2010,

Telia UTA, through certain Telia management, entered into an agreement with Shell Company

22
Case 1:19-cr-00165-KMW Document 1

 

Flied OG/O7/19 Page 23 of 36

C, pursuant to which Shell Company C agreed to sell 20% of its indirect 26% ownership interest
in Coscom for $220 million. In addition, on or about that same day, Telia UTA, Telia Uzbek,
and Shell Company C entered into an Amendment Agreement to the Shareholders Agreement in
which Shell Company C retained the right to sell its remaining 6% ownership interest in Coscom
after February 15, 2013, for a floor price of $50 million. Both agreements were signed by certain
Telia management and by Associate C, on behalf of Shell Company C. On or about February 2,
2010, Telia authorized a payment of $220 million to Shell Company Câs bank account in Hong
Kong, through transactions into and out of correspondent bank accounts at financial institutions
in New York, New York. Telia management authorized the $220 million bribe payment to
KARIMOVA through Shell Company C in order to continue its telecom business in Uzbekistan.
50.  Inor about January 2010, AKHMEDOV solicited Telia for another bribe payment
for KARIMOVA. Over the next few months, AKHMEDOV had multiple discussions with
members of Coscomâs management team about obtaining 4G frequencies in. exchange for bribes
to KARIMOVA. In ot about April 2010, Telia agreed to make a $15 million corrupt payment to
benefit KARIMOVA in order to obtain certain 4G frequencies. The corrupt payment involved
multiple transactions in which Telia agreed to pay $15 million to a third-party vendor to assume
a debt owed to that vendor by a Swiss company that was beneficially owned by KARIMOVA.
To effectuate the corrupt payment, certain Telia management, including Telia Executive 1,
agreed to execute four separate and parallel agreements, which they understood would ultimately
benefit KARIMOVA. Certain Telia management, including Telia Executive 1, handled and
approved the transactions based on discussions and understandings reached with AKHMEDOV,
who they understood to be acting on behalf of KARIMOVA. On or about June 11, 2010, UzACI

issued a decision granting Coscom the right to use certain 4G frequencies that had previously

23

KG

been awarded to, and subsequently waived by, Uzdunrobita. On or about the same day, a
member of Telia management, copying Telia Executive 1, sent AKHMEDOV confirmation of
the payment. On or about June 15, 2010, Telia Uzbek transferred $15 million to the third-party
vendor to satisfy its obligations under the agreements. The $15 million payment was made
through transactions into and out of correspondent bank accounts at financial institutions in New
York, New York.

51. Inor about September 2010, AKHMEDOV began negotiations with certain Telia
management concerning an additional bribe for KARIMOVA through a proposed services
agreement between Shell Company C and Telia Uzbek. On or about October 17, 2010, certain
Telia management, including Telia Executive 1, drafted a proposal for the Telia board of
directors to review, which explained that Shell Company C had offered Coscom additional 4G
frequencies and the opportunity to lease fiber optic network from Uzbektelecom. The cost of the
proposed deal was $75 million, with $20 million payable to Uzbektelecom in return for a 20-year
lease and $55 million payable to Shell Company C. Teliaâs board approved the transaction
during a board meeting on or about October 22, 2010. On or about November 1, 2010, Telia
Uzbek entered into an agreement with Shell Company C, in which Shell Company C agreed to
obtain permission from UzACI for Coscom to use certain 4G frequencies and to execute a long-
term lease agreement with Uzbektelecom. In exchange, Telia Uzbek agreed to pay $55 million
to Shell Company C. The agreement was signed by Associate C on behalf of Shell Company C.
On or about November 26, 2010, UzACI granted Coscom the right to use certain AG frequencies,
which had previously been held and waived by Uzdunrobita. After the 4G frequencies were
granted to Coscom, certain Telia management, including Telia Executive 1, sought to fabricate a

justification for the $55 million bribe payment to Shell Company C, because, unlike with the 3G

24

â

frequency transaction, Shell Company C never held the relevant frequencies and, therefore, did
not repudiate them. On or about December 16, 2010, Telia transferred $55 million to Shell
Company Câs Swiss bank account, which was routed through transactions into and out of
correspondent bank accounts at financial institutions in New York, New York.

Gulnara Karimova, 46, a citizen of Uzbekistan, was charged in an indictment filed in the Southern District of New York on March 7 with one
count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. Karimova is a former Uzbek official who allegedly had influence over the Uzbek governmental
body that regulated the telecom industry. Bekhzod Akhmedov, 44, a citizen of Uzbekistan and the former Uzbek executive, was charged in the
same indictment with one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), two counts of violating the FCPA, and one
count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. Karimovaâs and Akhmedovâs case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood of the
Southern District of New York.

âGulnara Karimova stands accused of exploiting her official position to solicit and accept more than $865 million in bribes from three publicly
traded telecom companies, and then laundering those bribes through the U.S. financial system,â said Assistant Attorney General Benczkowski.
âThe indictment and corporate resolution announced today, together with two prior corporate resolutions involving bribes allegedly paid to
Karimova, demonstrate the Departmentâs comprehensive approach to foreign corruption: we will aggressively pursue both corrupt foreign
officials and the companies and individuals who bribe them in order to gain unfair business advantages, and we will do everything we can to
keep the proceeds of that corruption out of the U.S. financial system.â

âThis is the third installment in a trilogy of cases arising from an almost $1 billion bribery scheme that reached the highest echelons of the
Uzbekistan government and was orchestrated by some of the largest telecommunications companies in the world,â said U.S. Attorney Berman.
âBy funneling multimillion-dollar bribe payments through the U.S. financial system, the companies and individual defendants corruptly tried to
tip the global economy in their favor and line their own pockets. But they are now paying the price. Today, my Office and our law enforcement
partners are sending a bold, unequivocal message that the U.S. financial system is not in business to enable foreign bribery or money
laundering. This Office stands ready to prevent, prosecute, and penalize foreign corrupt practices wherever in the world we find them.â

âCorruption of this level and reach poisons our integrity as a participant in the global marketplace,â said HSI Washington Special Agent in
Charge Villanueva. âThanks to our skillful and collaborative investigators at HSI and the IRS-Cl, Karimova and Ahkmedovâs exploitive crimes will
be presented before the just eye of our courts and no longer will such corruption be permitted to metastasize across our borders.â

âWith the increase in globalization and ease with which funds can be moved, criminals think their financial transactions cannot be trackedâbut
they would be wrong,â said IRS-Cl Chief Fort. âWe will continue to investigate violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act to ensure our
countryâs financial institutions are not used for devious purposes. We are committed to aggressively pursuing all who engage in corruption,
money laundering, and bribery for their own personal gain and at the expense of the U.S. government.â

According to the indictment against Karimova and Akhmedov, in or around the early 2000s, they agreed that Akhmedov would solicit and
facilitate corrupt bribe payments from telecommunications companies seeking to enter the Uzbek market. In exchange, Karimova allegedly
used her influence over Uzbek authorities to help the telecommunications companies obtain and retain lucrative business opportunities in the
Uzbek telecommunications market. In total, Akhmedov conspired with the telecom companies and others to pay Karimova more than $865
million in bribes, and Akhmedov and Karimova conspired with others to launder and conceal those funds to, from and through bank accounts in
the United States, in order to promote the ongoing bribery scheme, the indictment alleges.

The charges in the indictment are merely allegations, and the defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt
in a court of law.

MTS entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the Department of Justice in connection with a criminal information filed yesterday in
the Southern District of New York charging the company with one count of conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery and books and records

provisions of the FCPA and one count of violating the internal controls provisions of the FCPA. KOLORIT pleaded guilty to a one-count criminal
information filed in the Southern District of New York, charging the company with conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery and books and records
provisions of the FCPA. Pursuant to its agreement with the department, MTS agreed to pay a total criminal penalty of $850 million to the United
States, including a $500,000 criminal fine and $40 million in criminal forfeiture that MTS agreed to pay on behalf of KOLORIT. MTS also agreed
to the imposition of an independent compliance monitor for a term of three years and to implement rigorous internal controls and cooperate
fully with the Departmentâs ongoing investigation, including its investigation of individuals such as Akhmedov and Karimova. The case against
MTS and KOLORIT is assigned to U.S. District Judge J. Paul Oetken of the Southern District of New York.

In related proceedings, MTS reached a settlement with the SEC. Under the terms of its agreement with the SEC, MTS agreed to pay a $100
million civil penalty. Consistent with Coordination of Corporate Resolution Penalties in Parallel and/or Joint Investigations and Proceedings
Arising from the Same Misconduct (Justice Manual 1-12.100), the Department of Justice agreed to credit the civil penalty paid to the SEC as part
of its agreement with MTS. Thus, the combined total amount of criminal and regulatory penalties paid by MTS and KOLORIT to U.S. authorities
will be $850 million.

According to the companiesâ admissions, MTS and KOLORIT, through various managers and employees within MTS, MTSâs Uzbek subsidiaries
Uzdunrobita LLC and KOLORIT, and other affiliated entities, paid approximately $420 million in bribes to Karimova, who had influence over the
Uzbek governmental body that regulated the telecom industry. The bribes were paid on multiple occasions between 2004 and 2012 so that
MTS could enter the Uzbek market through the acquisition of Uzdunrobita and so that Uzdunrobita could gain valuable telecom assets and
continue operating in Uzbekistan. The companies admittedly structured and concealed the bribes through payments to shell companies that
members of MTSâs and Uzdunrobitaâs management knew were beneficially owned by Karimova. MTS and Uzdunrobita also acquired KOLORIT,
knowing that the price MTS and Uzdunrobita paid was inflated, in order to bribe Karimova in exchange for Uzdunrobitaâs continuing to operate
in Uzbekistan. Uzdunrobita made payments to purported charities and for sponsorships to entities related to Karimova. The Uzbek government
expropriated Uzdunrobita in 2012 as a result of MTSâs, Uzdunrobitaâs and KOLORITâs failure to meet Karimovaâs demands for additional
payments.

A number of factors contributed to the Departmentâs criminal resolution with the companies, including (1) the companies did not voluntarily
disclose; (2) the companiesâ level of cooperation and remediation was lacking, not proactive; (3) the nature and seriousness of the office,
including $420 million in bribes to a high-level Uzbek official; and (4) the mitigating factors present in this case, including that the Uzbek
government expropriated the companiesâ telecommunications assets in Uzbekistan, resulting in no realized pecuniary gain to the companies as
a result of the misconduct.

The resolution, reached in coordination with the SECâs resolution, marks the third such resolution by a major international telecommunications
provider for bribery in Uzbekistan. On Feb. 18, 2016, Amsterdam-based VimpelCom and its Uzbek subsidiary, Unitel LLC, entered into
resolutions with the Department of Justice and admitted to a conspiracy to make more than $114 million in bribery payments to Karimova
between 2006 and 2012. On Sept. 21, 2017, Stockholm-based Telia and its Uzbek subsidiary, Coscom LLC, also entered into resolutions with
the Department and admitted to a conspiracy to make more than $331 million in bribery payments to Karimova. The investigation has thus far
yielded a combined total of over $2.6 billion in global fines and disgorgement, including over $1.3 billion in criminal penalties to the United
States. In related actions, the Department has also filed civil complaints seeking the forfeiture of more than $850 million held in bank accounts
in Switzerland, Belgium, Luxembourg and Ireland, which constitute bribe payments made by MTS, VimpelCom and Telia, or funds involved in the
laundering of those corrupt payments to Karimova.

 

The IRS-Cl and HSI are investigating the cases as part of the IRS Global Illicit Financial Team in Washington, D.C. Assistant Chief Ephraim
Wernick and Senior Litigation Counsel Nicola J. Mrazek of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Edward Imperatore
and Daniel Noble of the Southern District of New York are prosecuting the case against MTS and KOLORIT. Assistant Chief Wernick and Trial
Attorney Elina Rubin-Smith of the Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Imperatore and Noble are prosecuting the case against Karimova
and Akhmedov. Trial Attorney Michael Khoo of the Criminal Divisionâs Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section (MLARS) is prosecuting
the forfeiture case with substantial assistance from former MLARS Trial Attorney Marie M. Dalton, now an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Western
District of Washington.

Law enforcement authorities in Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, France, Ireland, Isle of Man, Latvia, Luxembourg, Norway, the Netherlands,
Switzerland, Sweden and the United Kingdom have provided valuable assistance in this case. The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International
Affairs provided significant assistance as well. The SEC referred the matter to the Department and also provided extensive cooperation and
assistance.

The Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice
Department's FCPA enforcement efforts can be found at www. justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.

Individuals with information about possible proceeds of foreign corruption located in or laundered through the United States should contact
federal law enforcement or send an email to kleptocracy@usdoj.gov.

Penalties

Bi The maximum sentence provided by statute for the offense to which the
Defendant is pleading guilty is as follows: imprisonment for 20 years, supervised release for
three years, and a fine of the greater of $500,000 or twice the amount of the property involved in
the transaction. In addition, the Defendant must pay $100 as a special assessment pursuant to 18
U.S.C. Â§ 3013, which will be due and should be paid at or before the time of sentencing. This
Court may also order him to make restitution pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 3663, 3663A, and 3664.
If a fine or restitution is imposed, it shall be payable immediately, unless, pursuant to 18 U.S.C.
Â§ 3572(d), the Court orders otherwise.! The Defendant understands that if he serves a term of
imprisonment, is released on supervised release, and then violates the conditions of his
supervised release, his supervised release could be revoked - even on the last day of the term -
and the Defendant could be returned to custody to serve another period of incarceration and a
new term of supervised release. The Defendant understands that the Bureau of Prisons has sole
discretion in designating the institution at which the Defendant will serve any term of
imprisonment imposed.

Waiver of Rights

4, The Defendant understands that by entering into this agreement, he surrenders
certain rights as outlined below:

a. If the Defendant had persisted in his plea of not guilty, he would have had
the right to a speedy jury trial with the close assistance of competent counsel. That trial could be
conducted by a judge, without a jury, if the Defendant, this Office, and the Court all agreed.

b. If the Defendant elected a jury trial, the jury would be composed of twelve
individuals selected from the community. Counsel and the Defendant would have the
opportunity to challenge prospective jurors who demonstrated bias or who were otherwise
unqualified, and would have the opportunity to strike a certain number of jurors peremptorily.
All twelve jurors would have to agree unanimously before the Defendant could be found guilty
of any count. The jury would be instructed that the Defendant was presumed to be innocent, and
that presumption could be overcome only by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

c, If the Defendant went to trial, the government would have the burden of
proving the Defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The Defendant would have the right to
confront and cross-examine the governmentâs witnesses. The Defendant would not have to
present any defense witnesses or evidence whatsoever. If the Defendant wanted to call witnesses
in his defense, however, he would have the subpoena power of the Court to compel the witnesses
to attend.

 

' Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Â§ 3612, if the Court imposes a fine in excess of $2,500 that remains
unpaid 15 days after it is imposed, the Defendant shal! be charged interest on that fine, unless the
Court modifies the interest payment in accordance with 18 U.S.C. Â§ 3612(f)(3).
â Ne eeereeeee errr

Case 8:15-cr-00332-TDC Document 26 Filed 06/15/15 Page 3 of 8

d. The Defendant would have the right to testify in his own defense if he so
chose, and he would have the right to refuse to testify. If he chose not to testify, the Court could
instruct the jury that they could not draw any adverse inference from his decision not to testify.

â¬. If the Defendant were found guilty after a trial, he would have the right to
appeal the verdict and the Courtâs pretrial and trial decisions on the admissibility of evidence to
see if any errors were committed which would require a new trial or dismissal of the charges
against him. By pleading guilty, the Defendant knowingly gives up the right to appeal the
verdict and the Courtâs decisions.

f. By pleading guilty, the Defendant will be giving up all of these rights,
except the right, under the limited circumstances set forth in the âWaiver of Appealâ paragraph
below, to appeal the sentence. By pleading guilty, the Defendant understands that he may have
to answer the Courtâs questions both about the rights he is giving up and about the facts of his
case. Any statements the Defendant makes during such a hearing would not be admissible
against him during a trial except in a criminal proceeding for perjury or false statement.

g. If the Court accepts the Defendantâs plea of guilty, there will be no further
trial or proceeding of any kind, and the Court will find him guilty.

te By pleading guilty, the Defendant will also be giving up certain valuable
civil rights and may be subject to deportation or other loss of immigration status. The Defendant
recognizes that if he is not a citizen of the United States, pleading guilty may have consequences
with respect to his immigration status. Under federal law, conviction for a broad range of crimes
can lead to adverse immigration consequences, including automatic removal from the United
States. Removal and other immigration consequences are the subject of a separate proceeding,
however, and the Defendant understands that no one, including his attorney or the Court, can
predict with certainty the effect of a conviction on immigration status. Defendant nevertheless
affirms that he wants to plead guilty regardless of any potential immigration consequences.

Advisory Sentencing Guidelines Apply

 

5. The Defendant understands that the Court will determine a sentencing guidelines
range for this case (henceforth the âadvisory guidelines rangeâ) pursuant to the Sentencing
Reform Act of 1984 at 18 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 3551-3742 (excepting 18 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 3553(b)(1) and 3742(e))
and 28 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 991 through 998. The Defendant further understands that the Court will
impose a sentence pursuant to the Sentencing Reform Act, as excised, and must take into account
the advisory guidelines range in establishing a reasonable sentence.

Factual and Advisory Guidelines Stipulation

6. This Office and the Defendant understand, agree and stipulate to the Statement of
Facts set forth in Attachment A hereto, which this Office would have proved beyond a
reasonable doubt had this case proceeded to trial, and set forth the following agreed-upon and
disputed applicable sentencing guidelines factors:
Case 8:15-cr-00332-TDC Document 26 Filed 06/15/15 Page 4 of 8

a. The base offense level is 6, pursuant to U.S.S.G. Â§Â§ 2S1.1(a)(1) and
2B1.1(a)(2), because Defendant was not convicted of an offense specifically referencing
Â§ 2B1.1.

b. The offense level is increased by 8 levels, pursuant to U.S.S.G.
Â§ 2B1.1(b)(1)(E), because the amount involved was more than $70,000 but less than $120,000.

C. The offense level is increased 2 levels, pursuant to U/S.S.G.
Â§ 281.1(b)(2)(B), because Defendantâs conduct involved a violation of 18 U.S.C. Â§ 1956.

d. The offense level is increased 2 levels, pursuant to U.S.S.G. Â§ 281.1(b)(3),
because the offense involved âsophisticated laundering,â including the use of a shell company
and offshore account.

e. The Defendant reserves the right to argue an adjustment for âminor
participant,â pursuant to U.S.S.G. Â§ 3B1.2(B). The Government reserves the right to oppose
such an adjustment.

f. The adjusted offense level is 18 (the Governmentâs position) or 16 (the
Defendantâs position).

g. This Office does not oppose a 2 level reduction in the Defendantâs
adjusted offense level, based upon the Defendantâs apparent prompt recognition and affirmative
acceptance of personal responsibility for his criminal conduct. This Office agrees to make a
motion pursuant to U.S.S.G. Â§ 3E1.1(b) for an additional 1 level decrease in recognition of the
Defendantâs timely notification of his intention to plead guilty. This Office may oppose any
adjustment for acceptance of responsibility if the Defendant (a) fails to admit each and every
item in the factual stipulation; (b) denies involvement in the offense; (c) gives conflicting
statements about his involvement in the offense; (d) is untruthful with the Court, this Office, or
the United States Probation Office; (e) obstructs or attempts to obstruct justice prior to
sentencing; (f) engages in any criminal conduct between the date of this agreement and the date
of sentencing; or (g) attempts to withdraw his plea of guilty. The final offense level is 15 (the
Governmentâs position) or 13 (the Defendantâs position).

7. The Defendant understands that there is no agreement as to his criminal history or
criminal history category, and that his criminal history could alter his offense level if he is a
career offender or if the instant offense was a part of a pattern of criminal conduct from which he
derived a substantial portion of his income.

8. This Office and the Defendant agree that with respect to the calculation of the
advisory guidelines range, no other offense characteristics, sentencing guidelines factors,
potential departures or adjustments set forth in the United States Sentencing Guidelines will be
raised or are in dispute. If the Defendant intends to argue for any factor that could take the
sentence outside of the advisory guidelines range, he will notify the Court, the United States
Probation Officer, and government counsel at least 14 days in advance of sentencing of the facts
or issues he intends to raise.

 
 

 

Case 8:15-cr-00332-TDC Document 26 Filed 06/15/15 Page 5 of 8

Obligations of this Office
9. At the time of sentencing, this Office will recommend a reasonable sentence.

10... The parties reserve the right to bring to the Courtâs attention at the time of
sentencing, and the Court will be entitled to consider, all relevant information concerning the
Defendantâs background, character, and conduct.

Forfeiture

11. | The Defendant agrees that as part of his acceptance of responsibility and pursuant
to 18 U.S.C. Â§ 981(a)(1)(C) and 28 U.S.C. Â§ 2461, he will consent to the entry of a forfeiture
money judgment in the amount of $26,500 in United States currency (the âForfeiture Money
Judgmentâ). The Defendant acknowledges that the $26,500 is subject to forfeiture as property,
real or personal, that was involved in, or was property traceable to property involved in, a money
laundering offense within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 982(a)(1) and 1956(h).

12. The Defendant agrees to consent to the entry of an order of forfeiture for the
Forfeiture Money Judgment and waives the requirements of Rules 32.2 and 43(a) of the Federal
Rules of Criminal Procedure regarding notice of the forfeiture in the charging instrument,
announcement of the forfeiture at sentencing, and incorporation of the forfeiture in the judgment.
The Defendant understands that the forfeiture of the Forfeiture Money Judgment is part of the
sentence that may be imposed in this case and waives any failure by the court to advise him of
this pursuant to Rule 11 (b)(1)(1) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure at the guilty plea
proceeding.

i t .
Assisting the Government with Regard to the Forfeiture

13. The Defendant agrees to assist fully in the forfeiture of the foregoing assets. The
Defendant agrees to disclose all of his assets and sources of income to the United States, and to
take all steps necessary to pass clear title to the forfeited assets to the United States, including but
not limited to executing any and all documents necessary to transfer such title, assisting in
bringing any assets located outside of the United States within the jurisdiction of the United
States, and taking whatever steps are necessary to ensure that assets subject to forfeiture are not
sold, disbursed, wasted, hidden or otherwise made unavailable for forfeiture. The Defendant
further agrees that he will not assist any third party in asserting a claim to the forfeited assets in
an ancillary proceeding and that he will testify truthfully in any such proceeding.

Waiver of Further Review of Forfeiture

14. The Defendant agrees to waive all constitutional, legal and equitable challenges
(including direct appeal, habeas corpus, or any other means) to any forfeiture carried out in
accordance with this Plea Agreement on any grounds, including that the forfeiture constitutes an
excessive fine or punishment or otherwise violates the Eighth Amendment. The Defendant also
agrees not to challenge or seek review of any civil or administrative forfeiture of any property
 

 

Case 8:15-cr-00332-TDC Document 26 Filed 06/15/15 Page 6 of 8

subject to forfeiture under this agreement, and will not assist any third party with regard to such
challenge or review or with regard to the filing of a petition for remission of forfeiture.

Civil and Administrative Penalties

15. | The Defendant acknowledges that no representations have been made to him with
respect to any civil or administrative consequences that may result from this plea of guilty
because such matters are solely within the province and discretion of the specific administrative
or governmental entity involved. Further, the Defendant understands that this agreement does
not resolve any civil tax liability that he may have, and that this agreement is with the United
States Attorneyâs Office and the Department of Justice, Criminal Division, Fraud Section, not
with the Internal Revenue Service. The Defendant acknowledges that the Internal Revenue
Service is not a party to this agreement and remains free to pursue any and all lawful remedies it
may have.

Waiver of Appeal

16. In exchange for the concessions made by this Office and the Defendant in this
plea agreement, this Office and the Defendant waive their rights to appeal as follows:

a. The Defendant knowingly waives all rights, except his right to effective
assistance of counsel, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1291 or otherwise, to appeal the Defendantâs
conviction;

b. . The Defendant and this Office knowingly waive all rights, pursuant to 18
U.S.C. Â§ 3742 or otherwise, to appeal whatever sentence is imposed (including the right to
appeal any issues that relate to the establishment of the advisory guidelines range, the
determination of the defendantâs criminal history, the weighing of the sentencing factors, and the
decision whether to impose and the calculation of any term of imprisonment, fine, order of
forfeiture, order of restitution, and term or condition of supervised release), except as follows:
(i) the Defendant reserves the right to appeal any term of imprisonment to the extent that it
exceeds any sentence within the advisory guidelines range resulting from an adjusted base
offense level of 15, and (ii) this Office reserves the right to appeal any term of imprisonment to
the extent that it is below any sentence within the advisory guidelines range resulting from an
adjusted base offense level of 13.

c. Nothing in this agreement shall be construed to prevent the Defendant or
this Office from invoking the provisions of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(a), or from
appealing from any decision thereunder, should a sentence be imposed that resulted from
arithmetical, technical, or other clear error.

d. The Defendant waives any and all rights under the Freedom of
Information Act relating to the investigation and prosecution of the above-captioned matter and
agrees not to file any request for documents from this Office or any investigating agency.
   

 

Case 8:15-cr-00332-TDC Document 26 Filed 06/15/15 Page 7 of 8

Obstruction or Other Violations of Law

17. The Defendant agrees that he will not commit any offense in violation of federal,
state or local law between the date of this agreement and his sentencing in this case. In the event
that the Defendant (i) engages in conduct after the date of this agreement which would justify a
finding of obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G. Â§ 3C1.1, or (ii) fails to accept personal
responsibility for his conduct by failing to acknowledge his guilt to the probation officer who
prepares the Presentence Report, or (iii) commits any offense in violation of federal, state or
local law, then this Office will be relieved of its obligations to the Defendant as reflected in this
agreement. Specifically, this Office will be free to argue sentencing guidelines factors other than
those stipulated in this agreement, and it will also be free to make sentencing recommendations
other than those set out in this agreement. As with any alleged breach of this agreement, this
Office will bear the burden of convincing the Court of the Defendantâs obstructive or unlawful
behavior and/or failure to acknowledge personal responsibility by a preponderance of the
evidence. The Defendant acknowledges that he may not withdraw his guilty plea because this
Office is relieved of its obligations under the agreement pursuant to this paragraph.

Court Not a Party

18. The Defendant expressly understands that the Court is not a party to this
agreement. In the federal system, the sentence to be imposed is within the sole discretion of the
Court. In particular, the Defendant understands that neither the United States Probation Office
nor the Court is bound by the stipulation set forth above, and that the Court will, with the aid of
the Presentence Report, determine the facts relevant to sentencing. The Defendant understands
that the Court cannot rely exclusively upon the stipulation in ascertaining the factors relevant to
the determination of sentence. Rather, in determining the factual basis for the sentence, the
Court will consider the stipulation, together with the results of the presentence investigation, and
any other relevant information. The Defendant understands that the Court is under no obligation
to accept this Officeâs recommendations, and the Court has the power to impose a sentence up to
and including the statutory maximum stated above. The Defendant understands that if the Court
ascertains factors different from those contained in the stipulation set forth above, or if the Court
should impose any sentence up to the maximum established by statute, the Defendant cannot, for
that reason alone, withdraw his guilty plea, and will remain bound to fulfill all of his obligations
under this agreement. The Defendant understands that neither the prosecutor, his counsel, nor
the Court can make a binding prediction, promise, or representation as to what guidelines range
or sentence the Defendant will receive. The Defendant agrees that no one has made such a
binding prediction or promise.

Entire Agreement

19. This agreement supersedes any prior understandings, promises, or conditions
between this Office and the Defendant and constitutes the complete plea agreement in this case.
The Defendant acknowledges that there are no other agreements, promises, undertakings or
understandings between the Defendant and this Office other than those set forth in this
agreement and none will be entered into unless in writing and signed by all parties.

ATTACHMENT A: SEE,
STIPULATED FACTS ~ UNITED STATES v. BORIS RUBIZHEVSKY â*iS0up,

 

If this matter had proceeded to trial, the government would have proven the Pe 5p,
facts beyond a reasonable doubt. The parties agree that the following facts do not encompass all
of the facts that would have been proven had this matter proceeded to trial.

Between in or about October 2011 and continuing through in or about February 2013,

BORIS RUBIZHEVSKY (âRUBIZHEVSKYâ) did willfully, and knowingly combine,

conspire, confederate and agree with Foreign Official One, Executive A and others to conduct
and attempt to conduct financial transactions which they knew to involve the proceeds of some
form of unlawful activity, knowing that the transactions were designed in whole and in part to
conceal and disguise the nature, location, source, ownership and control of the proceeds of said
distribution, in violation of 18 U.S.C. Â§ 1956(a)(1)(B)(i).

RUBIZHEVSKY was a citizen of the United States and resident of New Jersey, and was
the owner and sole employee of NexGen Security Corporation (âNexGenâ), based in New
Jersey.

JSC Techsnabexport (âTENEXâ) supplied uranium and uranium enrichment services to
nuclear power companies throughout the world on behalf of the Russian Federation. TENEX
was indirectly owned and controlled by, and performed functions of, the government of the
Russian Federation.

TENEX established a wholly-owned subsidiary company located in the United States in
or about October 2010, TENAM Corporation (âTENAMâ). TENAM, which was incorporated in
Maryland, was TENEXâs official representative office in the United States. TENAM was
indirectly owned and controlled by, and performed functions of, the government of the Russian
Federation.

Foreign Official One, a national of the Russian Federation, was a Director of TENEX
from at least 2004 through in or about October 2010, and was the President of TENAM from in
or about October 2010 through in or about October 2014. From in or about December 2011
through in or about October 2014, Foreign Official One was a resident of Maryland.

Cylinder Corporation A was a company, based in Ohio, which engaged in the
manufacture of tanks and vessels for the oil and gas, nuclear, and marine markets. Cylinder
Corporation A secured contracts with TENEX to supply storage and transportation cylinders. In
or about September 2012, Cylinder Corporation A was acquired by another company
headquartered in Ohio.

Executive A was an officer of Cylinder Corporation A.
Between at least in or about October 2011 and in or about February 2013, Foreign

Official One, Executive A, and others entered into a conspiracy and devised and executed a
scheme and artifice to defraud TENEX of money and property and of the intangible right to

Foreign Official Oneâs honest services through a scheme for Foreign Official One to obtain
payments from Cylinder Corporation A, which made those payments for the purpose of
attempting to secure a competitive and unfair advantage in acquiring business with TENEX (âthe
scheme to defraudâ).

In order to conceal the scheme to defraud, Foreign Official One and Executive A engaged
intermediaries, including RUBIZHEVSKY, to transfer payments from Cylinder Corporation A
into foreign bank accounts for the benefit of Foreign Official One. RUBIZHEVSKY conducted
the financial transactions knowing the transactions involved the proceeds of the scheme to
defraud and knowing that the purpose of his involvement in the transactions was to conceal the
nature, source, ownership and control of the proceeds.

It was part of the scheme to defraud that Foreign Official One provided Cylinder
Corporation A, which was attempting to secure contracts with TENEX and which made
payments for the purpose of attempting to secure an unfair advantage, with assistance in
obtaining contracts with TENEX. In furtherance of the scheme to defraud, Foreign Official One
sent electronic mail (âemailâ) to RUBIZHEVSKY, including an email dated November 18,
2011, instructing RUBIZHEVSKY to verify that Executive A received an instruction for
Cylinder Corporation A to submit âfakeâ tender documents to TENEX. Foreign Official One
informed RUBIZHEVSKY in the email that â[t]his is for secure measures if someone will
search the formalities.â In addition to communicating through email, Foreign Official One and
RUBIZHEVSKY met with each other in person in Maryland to discuss aspects of the scheme to
defraud.

In furtherance of the money laundering conspiracy, RUBIZHEVSKY and his co-
conspirators, among other things, knowingly created sham contracts, communicated via email,
and caused wire payments to be made. For example, RUBIZHEVSKY entered into sham
consulting agreements with both Cylinder Corporation A and a corporation in the United
Kingdom. RUBIZHEVSKY did not provide the consulting services described in the
agreements. Instead, as described in the following paragraph, RUBIZHEVSKY merely
received payments from Cylinder Corporation A and made payments as directed by, and for the
benefit of, Foreign Official One.

In or about July 2012, RUBIZHEVSKY received a $16,500 payment from Cylinder
Corporation A. Shortly thereafter, RUBIZHEVSKY provided Foreign Official One with access
to money from a bank account in Switzerland, and Foreign Official One later provided
RUBIZHEVSKY with a portion of that money. Subsequently, in or about November 2012,
RUBIZHEVSKY received a $91,500 payment from Cylinder Corporation Aâs bank account,
and shortly thereafter, RUBIZHEVSKY wired $60,000 from the NexGen bank account into a
Latvian bank account, at the direction of Foreign Official One and for the benefit of Foreign
Official One.

As set forth above, RUBIZHEVSKY knowingly participated with Foreign Official One,
Executive A, and others in financial transactions involving the proceeds of wire fraud and wire
fraud conspiracy that were designed to conceal the nature, location, source, ownership and

 

 
Case 8:15-cr-00332-TDC Document 26-1 Filed 06/15/15 Page 3 of 3

control of those proceeds. RUBIZHEVSKYâs agreement and involvement in the money
laundering conspiracy resulted in at leastâ $70,000, but less than $120,000, of laundered funds.

I have read this statement of facts and carefully reviewed it with my attorney. I
acknowledge that it is true and correct.

Russian Nuclear Energy Official Pleads Guilty to Money Laundering Conspiracy Involving
Violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act

U.S. Conspirators Paid Over $2 Million to Influence Russian Nuclear Energy Official and to Secure Business with State-Owned Russian Nuclear
Energy Company

A Russian official residing in Maryland pleaded guilty today to conspiracy to commit money laundering in connection with his role in arranging
over $2 million in corrupt payments to influence the awarding of contracts with the Russian state-owned nuclear energy corporation.

Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Rod J. Rosenstein of the District of
Maryland, Deputy Inspector General John R. Hartman of the U.S. Department of Energy-Office of Inspector General (DOE-OIG) and Assistant
Director in Charge Andrew G. McCabe of the FBIâs Washington, D.C., Field Office made the announcement.

Vadim Mikerin, 56, of Chevy Chase, Maryland, pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Theodore D. Chuang of the District of Maryland.
Sentencing is scheduled before Judge Chuang on Dec. 8, 2015.

According to court documents, Mikerin was the president of TENAM Corporation and a director of the Pan American Department of JSC
Techsnabexport (TENEX). TENAM, based in Bethesda, Maryland, is a wholly-owned subsidiary and the official representative of TENEX in the
United States. TENEX, based in Moscow, acts as the sole supplier and exporter of Russian Federation uranium and uranium enrichment services
to nuclear power companies worldwide. TENEX is a subsidiary of Russiaâs State Atomic Energy Corporation.

In connection with the scheme, Daren Condrey, 50, of Glenwood, Maryland, pleaded guilty on June 17, 2015, to conspiring to violate the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and conspiring to commit wire fraud, and will be sentenced on Nov. 2, 2015. Boris Rubizhevsky, 64, of Closter,
New Jersey, pleaded guilty on June 15, 2015, to conspiracy to commit money laundering and will be sentenced on Oct. 19, 2015.

According to court documents, between 2004 and October 2014, Mikerin conspired with Condrey, Rubizhevsky and others to transmit funds
from Maryland and elsewhere in the United States to offshore shell company bank accounts located in Cyprus, Latvia and Switzerland. Mikerin
admitted the funds were transmitted with the intent to promote a corrupt payment scheme that violated the FCPA. Specifically, he admitted
that the corrupt payments were made by conspirators to influence Mikerin and to secure improper business advantages for U.S. companies that
did business with TENEX. Mikerin further admitted that he and others used consulting agreements and code words such as âlucky figure,â âLF,â
âcakeâ and âremunerationâ to disguise the corrupt payments.

According to court documents, over the course of the scheme, Mikerin conspired with Condrey, Rubizhevsky and others to transfer
approximately $2,126,622 from the United States to offshore shell company bank accounts. As part of his plea agreement, Mikerin has agreed
to the entry of a forfeiture money judgment in that amount.

The case was investigated by DOE-OIG and the FBI. The case is being prosecuted by Trial Attorneys Christopher Cestaro, Ephraim Wernick and
Derek Ettinger of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys David |. Salem and Michael T. Packard of the District of
Maryland.

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA PLEA AGREEMENT
- against â Cr. No. 16-644 (RJD)
BRASKEM S.A.,
Defendant.
Soe KEE ered xX

The United States of America, by and through the Department of Justice, Criminal
Division, Fraud Section (the âFraud Sectionâ), and the United States Attorneyâs Office for the
Eastern District of New York (the âEDNYâ), and Braskem S.A. (the âDefendantâ), by and
through its undersigned attorneys, and through its authorized representative, pursuant to
authority granted by the Defendantâs Board of Directors hereby submit and enter into this plea
agreement (the âAgreementâ), pursuant to Rule 11(c)(1)(C) of the Federal Rules of Criminal
Procedure. The terms and conditions of this Agreement are as follows:

TERM OF THE DEFENDANTâS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE AGREEMENT

1. Except as otherwise provided in Paragraph 11 below in connection with the
Defendantâs cooperation obligations, the Defendantâs obligations under the Agreement shall last
and be effective for a period beginning on the date on which the Information is filed and ending
three years from the later of the date on which the Information is filed or the date on which the
independent compliance monitor (the âMonitorâ) is retained by the Defendant, as described in
Paragraphs 30 to 32 below (the âTermâ). The Defendant agrees, however, that, in the event the

Fraud Section and EDNY determine, in their sole discretion, that the Defendant has failed
specifically to perform or to fulfill completely each of the Defendantâs obligations under this
Agreement, an extension or extensions of the Term may be imposed by the Fraud Section and
EDNY, in their sole discretion, for up to a total additional time period of one year, without
prejudice to the Fraud Section and EDNYâs right to proceed as provided in Paragraphs 30 to 32
below. Any extension of the Term extends all terms of this Agreement, including the terms of
the monitorship in Attachment D, for an equivalent period. Conversely, in the event the Fraud
Section and EDNY find, in their sole discretion, that there exists a change in circumstances
sufficient to eliminate the need for the monitorship in Attachment D, and that the other
provisions of this Agreement have been satisfied, the Term may be terminated early, except for
the Defendantâs cooperation obligations described in Paragraph 11 below.
RELEVANT CONSIDERATIONS

2. The Fraud Section and EDNY enter into this Agreement based on the individual
facts and circumstances presented by this case, including:

a. the Defendant did not voluntarily disclose to the Fraud Section and EDNY
the conduct described in the Statement of Facts, attached here to as Attachment B (the
âStatement of Factsâ). Although the Defendant notified the Fraud Section about publicly-
reported allegations in Brazil prior to the Fraud Section and EDNY contacting the Defendant,
because the Fraud Section and EDNY were already aware of the allegations, the Defendant was
not eligible for voluntary disclosure credit;

b. the Defendant received partial cooperation credit for its cooperation with
the Fraud Section and EDNYâs investigation by reviewing, collecting and producing evidence
located in foreign countries, analyzing and summarizing voluminous accounting records and

providing those summaries to the Fraud Section and to EDNY, producing documents that were

2
provided to foreign authorities along with translations, facilitating the cooperation of its former
executives in Brazil as part of the Brazilian leniency proceedings, providing multiple reports to
the Fraud Section and EDNY summarizing information regarding Braskemâs transfer of funds
into the Odebrecht S.A. off-book accounting system, and providing non-privileged facts relating
to individual involvement in the conduct described in the Statement of Facts and conduct
disclosed to the Fraud Section and EDNY prior to the Agreement. Once the Defendant became
aware of additional allegations, it expanded its internal investigation to include those allegations.
The Defendant did not receive additional cooperation credit because the Defendant did not begin
to fully cooperate until the Fraud Section and EDNY developed significant independent evidence
of the Defendantâs conduct. For example, the Defendant failed to produce any documents,
information about witness statements, or information about the facts gathered from its internal
investigation until seven months after its initial contact with the Fraud Section and EDNY;

c. the Defendant engaged in extensive remedial measures, including steps to
improve its anti-corruption compliance program by, among other things, increasing the number
of independent board members, creating a board-level compliance committee, hiring a chief
compliance officer, instructing outside counsel to conduct a global anti-corruption compliance
risk assessment and adopting the recommendations arising from that risk assessment, increasing
the importance of anti-corruption compliance messaging within the company with regular
statements from the companyâs new CEO, conducing an independent risk assessment of the
companyâs financial controls and enhancing those controls, in conjunction with the parent
company, developing a new comprehensive anti-corruption compliance policy, designing an
enhanced anti-corruption third-party due diligence process, standardizing anti-corruption

language in its contracts, and providing anti-corruption training to the board, senior management,
and other company employees. Because the senior management at the Defendant were in a
position to discipline employees were themselves involved in the misconduct, the Defendant was
unable to discipline wrongdoers until after the senior management resigned or were terminated,
at which point there were no longer any employees left at the Defendant who had been engaged
in the misconduct or had failed to effectively supervise or detect the misconduct;

d. although the Defendant had inadequate anti-corruption controls and little
or no anti-corruption compliance program during the period of the conduct described in the
Statement of Facts, the Defendant has been enhancing and has committed to continue to enhance
its anti-corruption compliance program and internal controls, including ensuring that its
compliance program satisfies the minimum elements set forth in Attachment C to this
Agreement;

e. because the Defendant has not yet fully implemented or tested its
compliance program, the Defendant has agreed to the imposition of an independent compliance
monitor to reduce the risk of recurrence of misconduct (as set forth in Paragraphs 30 to 32
below);

Â£: the nature and seriousness of the offense including a scheme to pay $250
million in improper payments to Brazilian government officials during the relevant period
carried out by high-level executives and directors at the Defendant;

g. the Defendant has no prior criminal history;

h. the Defendant has agreed to continue to cooperate with the Fraud Section
and EDNY in any ongoing investigation of the conduct of the Defendant and its officers,
directors, employees, agents, business partners, and consultants relating to violations of the

Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (âFCPAâ); and
i. accordingly, after considering (a) through (h) above, the Defendant
received an aggregate discount of 15 percent off of the bottom of the applicable U.S. Sentencing
Guidelines fine range.

THE DEFENDANTâS AGREEMENT

Bi: Pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(c)(1)(C), the Defendant agrees to knowingly
waive indictment and its right to challenge venue in the United States District Court for the
Eastern District of New York, and to plead guilty to a one-count criminal Information charging
the Defendant with conspiracy to commit offenses against the United States, in violation of Title
18, United States Code, Section 371, that is, to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA,
as amended, Title 15, United States Code, Sections 78dd-1 (the âInformationâ). The Defendant
further agrees to persist in that plea through sentencing.

4. The Defendant understands that, to be guilty of this offense, the following
essential elements of the offense must be satisfied:

a. An unlawful agreement between two or more individuals to violate the

FCPA existed; specifically, as an issuer, to make use of the mails and means and
instrumentalities of interstate commerce corruptly in furtherance of an offer, payment, promise
to pay, and authorization of the payment of any money, offer, gift, promise to give, and
authorization of the giving of anything of value, to a foreign official, and to a person, while
knowing that all or a portion of such money and thing of value would be and had been offered,
given, and promised to a foreign official, for purposes of: (i) influencing acts and decisions of
such foreign official in his or her official capacity; (ii) inducing such foreign official to do and
omit to do acts in violation of the lawful duty of such official; (iii) securing an improper

advantage; and (iv) inducing such foreign official to use his or her influence with a foreign
government and agencies and instrumentalities thereof to affect and influence acts and decisions
of such government and agencies and instrumentalities, in order to assist the Defendant and its
co-conspirators in obtaining and retaining business for and with, and directing business to, any
person;

b. The Defendant knowingly and willfully joined that conspiracy;

ce One of the members of the conspiracy knowingly committed or caused to
be committed, in the Eastern District of New York or elsewhere in the United States, at least
one of the overt acts charged in the Information; and

d. The overt acts were committed to further some objective of the
conspiracy.

Ss The Defendant understands and agrees that this Agreement is between the Fraud
Section, EDNY and the Defendant and does not bind any other division or section of the
Department of Justice or any other federal, state, local, or foreign prosecuting, administrative, or
regulatory authority. Nevertheless, the Fraud Section and EDNY will bring this Agreement and
the nature and quality of the conduct, cooperation and remediation of the Defendant, its direct or
indirect affiliates, subsidiaries, and joint ventures, to the attention of other prosecuting authorities
or other agencies, as well as debarment authorities and Multilateral Development Banks
(âMDBsâ), if requested by the Defendant. By agreeing to provide this information to such
authorities, the Fraud Section and EDNY are not agreeing to advocate on behalf of the
Defendant, but rather are agreeing to provide facts to be evaluated independently by such
authorities.

6. The Defendant agrees that this Agreement will be executed by an authorized

corporate representative. The Defendant further agrees that a resolution duly adopted by the
Defendantâs Board of Directors, in the form attached to this Agreement as Attachment A
(âCertificate of Corporate Resolutionsâ), authorizes the Defendant to enter into this Agreement
and take all necessary steps to effectuate this Agreement, and that the signatures on this
Agreement by the Defendant and its counsel are authorized by the Defendantâs Board of
Directors, on behalf of the Defendant.

Ts The Defendant agrees that it has the full legal right, power, and authority to enter
into and perform all of its obligations under this Agreement.

8. The Defendant agrees to abide by all terms and obligations of this Agreement as

described herein, including, but not limited to, the following:

a. to plead guilty as set forth in this Agreement;
b. to abide by all sentencing stipulations contained in this Agreement;
c. to appear, through its duly appointed representatives, as ordered for all

court appearances, and obey any other ongoing court order in this matter, consistent with all

applicable U.S. and foreign laws, procedures, and regulations;

d. to commit no further crimes;
Ge to be truthful at all times with the Court;
f. to pay the applicable fine and special assessment;

g. to cooperate fully with the Fraud Section and EDNY as described in
Paragraph 11;

h. to implement a compliance program as described in Paragraph 9 and
Attachment C; and

i. to retain an independent compliance monitor pursuant to Paragraphs 30 to

32 and Attachment D.
9. The Defendant represents that it has implemented and will continue to implement
a compliance and ethics program throughout its operations, including those of its affiliates,
agents, and joint ventures, and those of its contractors and subcontractors whose responsibilities
include interacting with foreign officials or other activities carrying a high risk of corruption,
designed to prevent and detect violations of the FCPA and other applicable anti-corruption laws.
In order to address any deficiencies in its internal accounting controls, policies, and procedures,
the Defendant represents that it has undertaken, and will continue to undertake in the future, in a
manner consistent with all of its obligations under this Agreement, a review of its existing
internal accounting controls, policies, and procedures regarding compliance with the FCPA and
other applicable anti-corruption laws. Where necessary and appropriate, the Defendant will
adopt new or modify existing internal controls, policies, and procedures in order to ensure that
the Defendant maintains: (a) an effective system of internal accounting controls designed to
ensure the making and keeping of fair and accurate books, records, and accounts; and (b) a
rigorous anti-corruption compliance program that incorporates relevant internal accounting
controls, as well as policies and procedures designed to effectively detect and deter violations of
the FCPA and other applicable anti-corruption laws. The compliance program, including the
internal accounting controls system will include, but not be limited to, the minimum elements set
forth in Attachment C. The Fraud Section and EDNY, in their sole discretion, may consider the
Monitorâs certification decision in assessing the Defendantâs compliance program.

10. Except as may otherwise be agreed by the parties in connection with a particular
transaction, the Defendant agrees that in the event that, during the Term of the Agreement, it
undertakes any change in corporate form, including if it sells, merges, or transfers business

operations that are material to the Defendantâs consolidated operations, or to the operations of
any subsidiaries or affiliates involved in the conduct described in the Statement of Facts, as they
exist as of the date of this Agreement, whether such sale is structured as a sale, asset sale,
merger, transfer, or other change in corporate form, it shall include in any contract for sale,
merger, transfer, or other change in corporate form a provision binding the purchaser, or any
successor in interest thereto, to the obligations described in this Agreement. The purchaser or
successor in interest must also agree in writing that the Fraud Section and EDNYâs ability to
declare a breach under this Agreement is applicable in full force to that entity. The Defendant
agrees that the failure to include these provisions in the transaction will make any such
transaction null and void. The Defendant shall provide notice to the Fraud Section and EDNY at
least 30 days prior to undertaking any such sale, merger, transfer, or other change in corporate
form. If the Fraud Section and EDNY notify the Defendant prior to such transaction (or series of
transactions) that it has determined that the transaction(s) has the effect of circumventing or
frustrating the enforcement purposes of this Agreement, as determined in the sole discretion of
the Fraud Section and EDNY, the Defendant agrees that such transaction(s) will not be
consummated. In addition, if at any time during the Term of the Agreement the Fraud Section
and EDNY determine in their sole discretion that the Defendant has engaged in a transaction(s)
that has the effect of circumventing or frustrating the enforcement purposes of this Agreement, it
may deem it a breach of this Agreement pursuant to Paragraphs 24 to 27 of this Agreement.
Nothing herein shall restrict the Defendant from indemnifying (or otherwise holding harmless)
the purchaser or successor in interest for penalties or other costs arising from any conduct that
may have occurred prior to the date of the transaction, so long as such indemnification does not
have the effect of circumventing or frustrating the enforcement purposes of this Agreement, as

determined by the Fraud Section and EDNY.
11. The Defendant shall cooperate fully with the Fraud Section and EDNY in any and
all matters relating to the conduct described in this Agreement and the Statement of Facts, and
any individual or entity referred to therein, as well as any and all matters relating to corrupt
payments, false books and records, the failure to implement adequate internal accounting
controls, investment adviser fraud, mail, wire, securities, or bank fraud, false statements to a
bank, obstruction of justice, and money laundering, subject to applicable law and regulations,
until the later of the date upon which all investigations, prosecutions and proceedings, including
those involving Odebrecht S.A. (âOdebrechtâ), an entity with a controlling stake in the
Defendant, arising out of such conduct are concluded, or the end of the Term. At the request of
the Fraud Section and EDNY, the Defendant shall also cooperate fully with other domestic or
foreign law enforcement and regulatory authorities and agencies, as well as the MDBs in any
investigation of the Defendant, its affiliates, including Odebrecht and its affiliates, or any of its
present or former officers, directors, employees, agents, and consultants, or any other party, in
any and all matters relating to corrupt payments, false books and records, the failure to
implement adequate internal accounting controls, investment adviser fraud, mail, wire, securities,
or bank fraud, false statements to a bank, obstruction of justice, and money laundering. The
Defendant agrees that its cooperation pursuant to this Paragraph shall include, but not be limited
to, the following, subject to local law and regulations, including relevant data privacy and
national security laws and regulations:

a The Defendant shall truthfully disclose all factual information not
protected by a valid claim of attorney-client privilege or work product doctrine with respect to its
activities, those of its parent company and affiliates, and those of its present and former directors,

officers, employees, agents, and consultants, including any evidence or allegations and internal

10
or external investigations, about which the Defendant has any knowledge or about which the
Fraud Section and EDNY may inquire. This obligation of truthful disclosure includes, but is not
limited to, the obligation of the Defendant to provide to the Fraud Section and EDNY, upon
request, any document, record or other tangible evidence about which the Fraud Section and
EDNY may inquire of the Defendant.

b. Upon request of the Fraud Section and EDNY, the Defendant shall
designate knowledgeable employees, agents or attorneys to provide to the Fraud Section and
EDNY the information and materials described in Paragraph 11(a) above on behalf of the
Defendant. It is further understood that the Defendant must at all times provide complete,
truthful, and accurate information.

c. The Defendant shall use its best efforts to make available for interviews or
testimony, as requested by the Fraud Section and EDNY, present or former officers, directors,
employees, agents and consultants of the Defendant. This obligation includes, but is not limited
to, sworn testimony before a federal grand jury or in federal trials, as well as interviews with
domestic or foreign law enforcement and regulatory authorities. Cooperation under this
Paragraph shall include identification of witnesses who, to the knowledge of the Defendant, may
have material information regarding the matters under investigation.

d. With respect to any information, testimony, documents, records or other
tangible evidence provided to the Fraud Section and EDNY pursuant to this Agreement, the
Defendant consents to any and all disclosures, subject to applicable law and regulations, to other
governmental authorities, including United States authorities and those of a foreign government,
as well as the MDBs, of such materials as the Fraud Section and EDNY, in their sole discretion,

shall deem appropriate.

11
12. âIn addition to the obligations in Paragraph 11, during the Term, should the
Defendant learn of any evidence or allegation of conduct that would be a possible violation of the
FCPA anti-bribery or accounting provisions had the conduct occurred within the jurisdiction of
the United States, the Defendant shall promptly report such evidence or allegation to the Fraud
Section and EDNY. Thirty days prior to the end of the Term, the Defendant, by the Chief
Executive Officer of the Defendant and the Chief Financial Officer of the Defendant, will certify
to the Fraud Section and EDNY that the Defendant has met its disclosure obligations pursuant to
this Paragraph. Each certification will be deemed a material statement and representation by the
Defendant to the executive branch of the United States for purposes of 18 U.S.C. Â§ 1001, and it
will be deemed to have been made in the judicial district in which this Agreement is filed.

13. The Defendant agrees that any fine or restitution imposed by the Court will be
due and payable within 10 business days of sentencing, and the Defendant will not attempt to
avoid or delay payment, except as otherwise specified in Paragraph 21 below. The Defendant
further agrees to pay to the Clerk of the Court for the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of New York the mandatory special assessment of $400 (pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Â§
3103(a)(2)(B)) within 10 business days from the date of sentencing.

THE UNITED STATESâ? AGREEMENT

14. In exchange for the guilty plea of the Defendant and the complete fulfillment of
all of its obligations under this Agreement, the Fraud Section and EDNY agree that they will not
file additional criminal charges against the Defendant or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries
or joint ventures relating to any of the conduct described in the Information or the Statement of
Facts, except for the charges specified in the Information and Plea Agreement between the Fraud

Section and EDNY and Odebrecht S.A. filed on December 21, 2016 (âOdebrecht Plea

12
Agreementâ). The Fraud Section and EDNY, however, may use any information related to the
conduct described in the Statement of Facts against the Defendant: (a) in a prosecution for
perjury or obstruction of justice; (b) in a prosecution for making a false statement; (c) in a
prosecution or other proceeding relating to any crime of violence; or (d) in a prosecution or other
proceeding relating to a violation of any provision of Title 26 of the United States Code. This
Agreement does not provide any protection against prosecution for any future conduct by the
Defendant. In addition, this Agreement does not provide any protection against prosecution of
any individuals, regardless of their affiliation with the Defendant. The Defendant agrees that
nothing in this Agreement is intended to release the Defendant from any and all of the
Defendantâs tax liabilities and reporting obligations for any and all income not properly reported
and/or legally or illegally obtained or derived.
FACTUAL BASIS

15. The Defendant is pleading guilty because it is guilty of the charges contained in
the Information. The Defendant admits, agrees, and stipulates that the factual allegations set
forth in the Information and the Statement of Facts are true and correct, that it is responsible for
the acts of its officers, directors, employees, and agents described in the Information and the
Statement of Facts, and that the Information and the Statement of Facts accurately reflect the
Defendantâs criminal conduct. The Defendant stipulates to the admissibility of the Statement of
Facts in any proceeding by the Fraud Section and EDNY, including any trial, guilty plea, or
sentencing proceeding, and will not contradict anything in the attached Statement of Facts at any

such proceeding.

13
THE DEFENDANTâS WAIVER OF RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO APPEAL

16. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(f) and Federal Rule of Evidence 410 limit
the admissibility of statements made in the course of plea proceedings or plea discussions in both
civil and criminal proceedings, if the guilty plea is later withdrawn. The Defendant expressly
warrants that it has discussed these rules with its counsel and understands them. Solely to the
extent set forth below, the Defendant voluntarily waives and gives up the rights enumerated in
Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(f) and Federal Rule of Evidence 410. Specifically, the
Defendant understands and agrees that any statements that it makes in the course of its guilty
plea or in connection with the Agreement are admissible against it for any purpose in any U.S.
federal criminal proceeding if, even though the Fraud Section and EDNY have fulfilled all of
their obligations under this Agreement and the Court has imposed the agreed-upon sentence, the
Defendant nevertheless withdraws its guilty plea.

17. The Defendant is satisfied that the Defendantâs attorneys have rendered effective
assistance. The Defendant understands that by entering into this Agreement, the Defendant
surrenders certain rights as provided in this Agreement. The Defendant understands that the
rights of criminal defendants include the following:

a. the right to plead not guilty and to persist in that plea;

b. the right to a jury trial;

c. the right to be represented by counsel â and if necessary have the court
appoint counsel â at trial and at every other stage of the proceedings;

d. the right at trial to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses, to be
protected from compelled self-incrimination, to testify and present evidence, and to compel the

attendance of witnesses; and
e. pursuant to Title 18, United States Code, Section 3742, the right to appeal
the sentence imposed.

Nonetheless, the Defendant knowingly waives the right to appeal or collaterally attack
the conviction and any sentence within the statutory maximum described below (or the manner
in which that sentence was determined) on the grounds set forth in Title 18, United States Code,
Section 3742, or on any ground whatsoever except those specifically excluded in this Paragraph,
in exchange for the concessions made by the Fraud Section and EDNY in this plea agreement.
This Agreement does not affect the rights or obligations of the Fraud Section and EDNY as set
forth in Title 18, United States Code, Section 3742(b). The Defendant also knowingly waives
the right to bring any collateral challenge challenging either the conviction, or the sentence
imposed in this case. The Defendant hereby waives all rights, whether asserted directly or by a
representative, to request or receive from any department or agency of the United States any
records pertaining to the investigation or prosecution of this case, including without limitation
any records that may be sought under the Freedom of Information Act, Title 5, United States
Code, Section 552, or the Privacy Act, Title 5, United States Code, Section 552a. The Defendant
waives all defenses based on the statute of limitations and venue with respect to any prosecution
related to the conduct described in the Information and the Statement of Facts including any
prosecution that is not time-barred on the date that this Agreement is signed in the event that: (a)
the conviction is later vacated for any reason; (b) the Defendant violates this Agreement; or (c)
the plea is later withdrawn, provided such prosecution is brought within one year of any such
vacation of conviction, violation of the Agreement, or withdrawal of plea plus the remaining
time period of the statute of limitations as of the date that this Agreement is signed. The Fraud

Section and EDNY are free to take any position on appeal or any other post-judgment matter.

15
The parties agree that any challenge to the Defendantâs sentence that is not foreclosed by this
Paragraph will be limited to that portion of the sentencing calculation that is inconsistent with (or
not addressed by) this waiver. Nothing in the foregoing waiver of appellate and collateral review
rights shall preclude the Defendant from raising a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in an
appropriate forum.
PENALTY

18. The statutory maximum sentence that the Court can impose for a violation of Title
18, United States Code, Section 371, is: a fine of $500,000 or twice the gross pecuniary gain or
gross pecuniary loss resulting from the offense, whichever is greatest, Title 15, United States
Code, Section 78ff(a) and Title 18, United States Code, Section 3571(c), (d); five yearsâ
probation, Title 18, United States Code, Section 3561(c)(1); and a mandatory special assessment
of $400 per count, Title 18, United States Code, Section 3013(a)(2)(B). In this case, the parties
agree that the gross pecuniary gain resulting from the offense is $465,165,688.83. Therefore,
pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Â§ 3571(d), the maximum fine that may be imposed is twice the gross gain,
or approximately $930 million per offense.

SENTENCING RECOMMENDATION

19. The parties agree that pursuant to United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005),
the Court must determine an advisory sentencing guideline range pursuant to the United States
Sentencing Guidelines. The Court will then determine a reasonable sentence within the statutory
range after considering the advisory sentencing guideline range and the factors listed in Title 18,
United States Code, Section 3553(a). The partiesâ agreement herein to any guideline sentencing

factors constitutes proof of those factors sufficient to satisfy the applicable burden of proof. The

16
Defendant also understands that if the Court accepts this Agreement, the Court is bound by the

sentencing provisions in Paragraph 18.

20. The Fraud Section, EDNY and the Defendant agree that a faithful application of

the United States Sentencing Guidelines (U.S.S.G.) to determine the applicable fine range yields

the following analysis:

a.

b.

The 2016 USSG are applicable to this matter.

Offense LevelâBribery Conduct (Highest Offense Level). Based upon
USSG Â§ 2C1.1, the total offense level is 46, calculated as follows:

(a)(2) Base Offense Level 12
(b)(1) More than One Bribe +2
(b)(2) Value of Benefit more than $250,000,000 +28
(b)(3) High Level Official Involved +4
Total Offense Level 46

Base Fine. Based upon USSG Â§ 8C2.4(a)(2), the base fine is
$465,165,688.83.

Culpability Score. Based upon USSG Â§ 8C2.5, the culpability score is 8,
calculated as follows:

(a) Base Culpability Score 5
(b)(1)(A)(i) 5,000 or More Employees and

Participation by High-Level Personnel +5
(g)(2) Cooperation and Acceptance -2
TOTAL 8

A,
Calculation of Fine Range:

Base Fine (USSG Â§ 8C2.4(a)(2)) $465, 165,688.83
Multipliers (USSG Â§ 8C2.6) 1.6 (min)/ 3.2 (max)
Fine Range (USSG Â§ 8C2.7) $744,265,102.13 to

$1,488,530,204.26
21. Pursuant to Rule 11(c)(1)(C) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the

Fraud Section, EDNY and the Defendant agree that the following represents the appropriate
disposition of the case:

a. Disposition. Pursuant to Fed. R. Crim, P. 11(c)(1)(Â©), the Fraud Section,
EDNY and the Defendant agree that the appropriate disposition of this case is as set forth above,
and agree to recommend jointly that the Court, at a hearing to be scheduled at an agreed upon
time, impose a sentence requiring the Defendant to pay a criminal fine, as noted below.
Specifically, the parties agree, based on the application of the United States Sentencing
Guidelines, that the appropriate total criminal penalty is $632,625,336.81 (âTotal Criminal
Penaltyâ). This reflects a 15 percent discount off the bottom of the applicable Sentencing
Guidelines fine range. The Fraud Section and EDNY believe that a disposition that includes a
fine of $632,625,336.81 and disgorgement of $325 million is appropriate based on the factors
outlined in Paragraph 2 of the Agreement and those in 18 U.S.C. Â§ 3553(a).

b. The Fraud Section, EDNY and the Defendant further agree that the
Defendant will pay the United States $94,893,800.52, equal to 15 percent of the Total Criminal
Penalty. The Defendant agrees to pay $94,893,800.52 to the United States Treasury within 10

days of the entry of the judgment of Defendantâs sentence by the Court.
c. The Fraud Section, EDNY and the Defendant further agree that the
remaining amount of the Total Criminal Penalty will be paid to Brazil, which will receive 70
percent of the remaining penalty, equal to $442,837,735.77, and to Switzerland, which will
receive 15 percent of the remaining penalty, equal to $94,893,800.52, and that such amounts will
be credited by the Fraud Section and EDNY. The Defendantâs payment obligations to the United
States will be complete upon the Defendantâs payment of $94,893,800.52, equal to 15 percent of
the Total Criminal Penalty, so long as the Defendant pays the remaining amount of the Total
Criminal Penalty to Brazil and Switzerland pursuant to their respective agreements. In addition,
the Fraud Section, EDNY and the Defendant agree that the Defendant will pay $325 million in
disgorgement to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, pursuant to their respective
agreements with the Defendant, and to Brazil, and that such amounts will be credited by the
Fraud Section and EDNY. The Defendant shall not seek or accept directly or indirectly
reimbursement or indemnification from any source with regard to the penalty or disgorgement
amounts that the Defendant pays pursuant to the Agreement or any other agreement entered into
with an enforcement authority or regulator concerning the facts set forth in the Statement of
Facts. The Defendant further acknowledges that no tax deduction may be sought in connection
with the payment of any part of the Total Criminal Penalty.

d. Mandatory Special Assessment. The Defendant shall pay to the Clerk of
the Court for the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York within 10
days of the time of sentencing the mandatory special assessment of $400.

22. This Agreement is presented to the Court pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P.

11(c)(1)(C). The Defendant understands that, if the Court rejects this Agreement, the Court

must: (a) inform the parties that the Court rejects the Agreement; (b) advise the Defendantâs

19
counsel that the Court is not required to follow the Agreement and afford the Defendant the
opportunity to withdraw its plea; and (c) advise the Defendant that if the plea is not withdrawn,
the Court may dispose of the case less favorably toward the Defendant than the Agreement
contemplated. The Defendant further understands that if the Court refuses to accept any
provision of this Agreement, neither party shall be bound by the provisions of the Agreement.

23. The Defendant, the Fraud Section and EDNY waive the preparation of a Pre-
Sentence Investigation Report and intend to seek a sentencing by the Court immediately
following the Rule 11 hearing in the absence of a Pre-Sentence Investigation Report. The
Defendant understands that the decision whether to proceed with the sentencing proceeding
without a Pre-Sentence Investigation Report is exclusively that of the Court. In the event the
Court directs the preparation of a Pre-Sentence Investigation Report, the Fraud Section and
EDNY will fully inform the preparer of the Pre-Sentence Investigation Report and the Court of
the facts and law related to the Defendantâs case.

BREACH OF AGREEMENT

24. If the Defendant (a) commits any felony under U.S. federal law; (b) provides in
connection with this Agreement deliberately false, incomplete, or misleading information; (c)
fails to cooperate as set forth in Paragraphs 11 and 12 of this Agreement; (d) fails to implement a
compliance program as set forth in Paragraph 9 of this Agreement and Attachment C; (e)
commits any acts that, had they occurred within the jurisdictional reach of the FCPA, would be a
violation of the FCPA; or (f) otherwise fails specifically to perform or to fulfill completely each
of the Defendantâs obligations under the Agreement, regardless of whether the Fraud Section and
EDNY become aware of such a breach after the Term, the Defendant shall thereafter be subject

to prosecution for any federal criminal violation of which the Fraud Section and EDNY have

20
knowledge, including, but not limited to, the charges in the Information described in Paragraph
3, which may be pursued by the Fraud Section, EDNY or any other United States Attorneyâs
Office that has venue over the conduct. Determination of whether the Defendant has breached
the Agreement and whether to pursue prosecution of the Defendant shall be in the Fraud Section
and EDNYâs sole discretion. Any such prosecution may be premised on information provided
by the Defendant or its personnel. Any such prosecution relating to the conduct described in the
Information and the attached Statement of Facts or relating to conduct known to the Fraud
Section and EDNY prior to the date on which this Agreement was signed that is not time-barred
by the applicable statute of limitations on the date of the signing of this Agreement may be
commenced against the Defendant, notwithstanding the expiration of the statute of limitations,
between the signing of this Agreement and the expiration of the Term of the Agreement plus one
year. Thus, by signing this Agreement, the Defendant agrees that the statute of limitations with
respect to any such prosecution that is not time-barred on the date of the signing of this
Agreement shall be tolled for the Term of the Agreement plus one year. The Defendant gives up
all defenses based on the statute of limitations, any claim of pre-indictment delay, or any speedy
trial claim with respect to any such prosecution or action, except to the extent that such defenses
existed as of the date of the signing of this Agreement. In addition, the Defendant agrees that the
statute of limitations as to any violation of federal law that occurs during the term of the
cooperation obligations provided for in Paragraph 11 of the Agreement will be tolled from the
date upon which the violation occurs until the earlier of the date upon which the Fraud Section
and EDNY are made aware of the violation or the duration of the Term plus five years, and that
this period shall be excluded from any calculation of time for purposes of the application of the

statute of limitations.

21
25. Inthe event the Fraud Section and EDNY determine that the Defendant has
breached this Agreement, the Fraud Section and EDNY agree to provide the Defendant with
written notice of such breach prior to instituting any prosecution resulting from such breach.
Within 30 days of receipt of such notice, the Defendant shall have the opportunity to respond to
the Fraud Section and EDNY in writing to explain the nature and circumstances of such breach,
as well as the actions the Defendant has taken to address and remediate the situation, which
explanation the Fraud Section and EDNY shall consider in determining whether to pursue
prosecution of the Defendant.

26. In the event that the Fraud Section and EDNY determine that the Defendant has
breached this Agreement: (a) all statements made by or on behalf of the Defendant to the Fraud
Section and EDNY or to the Court, including the Information and the Statement of Facts, and
any testimony given by the Defendant before a grand jury, a court, or any tribunal, or at any
legislative hearings, whether prior or subsequent to this Agreement, and any leads derived from
such statements or testimony, shall be admissible in evidence in any and all criminal proceedings
brought by the Fraud Section and EDNY against the Defendant; and (b) the Defendant shall not
assert any claim under the United States Constitution, Rule 11(f) of the Federal Rules of
Criminal Procedure, Rule 410 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, or any other federal rule that any
such statements or testimony made by or on behalf of the Defendant prior or subsequent to this
Agreement, or any leads derived therefrom, should be suppressed or are otherwise inadmissible.
The decision whether conduct or statements of any current director, officer or employee, or any
person acting on behalf of, or at the direction of, the Defendant, will be imputed to the Defendant
for the purpose of determining whether the Defendant has violated any provision of this

Agreement shall be in the sole discretion of the Fraud Section and EDNY.

22
27. The Defendant acknowledges that the Fraud Section and EDNY have made no
representations, assurances, or promises concerning what sentence may be imposed by the Court
if the Defendant breaches this Agreement and this matter proceeds to judgment. The Defendant
further acknowledges that any such sentence is solely within the discretion of the Court and that
nothing in this Agreement binds or restricts the Court in the exercise of such discretion.

PUBLIC STATEMENTS BY THE DEFENDANT

28. The Defendant expressly agrees that it shall not, through present or future
attorneys, officers, directors, employees, agents or any other person authorized to speak for the
Defendant make any public statement, in litigation or otherwise, contradicting the acceptance of
responsibility by the Defendant set forth above or the facts described in the Information and the
Statement of Facts. Any such contradictory statement shall, subject to cure rights of the
Defendant described below, constitute a breach of this Agreement, and the Defendant thereafter
shall be subject to prosecution as set forth in Paragraphs 24 to 27 of this Agreement. The
decision whether any public statement by any such person contradicting a fact contained in the
Information or the Statement of Facts will be imputed to the Defendant for the purpose of
determining whether it has breached this Agreement shall be at the sole discretion of the Fraud
Section and EDNY. If the Fraud Section and EDNY determine that a public statement by any
such person contradicts in whole or in part a statement contained in the Information or the
Statement of Facts, the Fraud Section and EDNY shall so notify the Defendant, and the
Defendant may avoid a breach of this Agreement by publicly repudiating such statement(s)
within five business days after notification. The Defendant shall be permitted to raise defenses
and to assert affirmative claims in other proceedings relating to the matters set forth in the

Information and the Statement of Facts provided that such defenses and claims do not contradict,

23
in whole or in part, a statement contained in the Information or the Statement of Facts. This
Paragraph does not apply to any statement made by any present or former officer, director,
employee, or agent of the Defendant in the course of any criminal, regulatory, or civil case
initiated against such individual, unless such individual is speaking on behalf of the Defendant.

29. The Defendant agrees that if it or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries or
affiliates over which the Defendant exercises control issues a press release or holds any press
conference in connection with this Agreement, the Defendant shall first consult the Fraud
Section and EDNY to determine (a) whether the text of the release or proposed statements at the
press conference are true and accurate with respect to matters between the Fraud Section, EDNY
and the Defendant; and (b) whether the Fraud Section and EDNY have any objection to the
release or statement.

INDEPENDENT COMPLIANCE MONITOR

30. Promptly after the Fraud Section and EDNYâs selection pursuant to Paragraph 31
below, the Defendant agrees to retain the Monitor for the term specified in Paragraph 32. The
Monitorâs duties and authority, and the obligations of the Defendant with respect to the Monitor
and the Fraud Section and EDNY, are set forth in Attachment D, which is incorporated by
reference into this Agreement. No later than the date of execution of this Agreement, the
Defendant will propose to the Fraud Section and EDNY a pool of three qualified candidates to
serve as the Monitor. The parties will endeavor to complete the monitor selection process
within 60 days of the execution of this agreement. The Monitor candidates or their team
members shall have, at a minimum, the following qualifications:

a. demonstrated expertise with respect to the FCPA and other applicable

anti-corruption laws, including experience counseling on FCPA issues;

24
b. experience designing and/or reviewing corporate compliance policies,
procedures and internal controls, including FCPA and anti-corruption policies, procedures and
internal controls;

c. the ability to access and deploy resources as necessary to discharge the
Monitorâs duties as described in the Agreement; and

d. sufficient independence from the Defendant to ensure effective and
impartial performance of the Monitorâs duties as described in the Agreement.

31. The Fraud Section and EDNY retain the right, in their sole discretion, to choose
the Monitor from among the candidates proposed by the Defendant, though the Defendant may
express its preference(s) among the candidates. If the Fraud Section and EDNY determine, in
their sole discretion, that any of the candidates are not, in fact, qualified to serve as the Monitor,
or if the Fraud Section and EDNY, in their sole discretion, are not satisfied with the candidates
proposed, the Fraud Section and EDNY reserve the right to request that the Defendant nominate
additional candidates. In the event the Fraud Section and EDNY reject all proposed Monitors,
the Defendant shall propose an additional three candidates within 20 business days after
receiving notice of the rejection. This process shall continue until a Monitor acceptable to both
parties is chosen. The Fraud Section, EDNY and the Defendant will use their best efforts to
complete the selection process within 60 calendar days of the execution of this Agreement. If,
during the term of the monitorship, the Monitor becomes unable to perform his or her obligations
as set out herein and in Attachment D, or if the Fraud Section and EDNY in their sole discretion
determine that the Monitor cannot fulfill such obligations to the satisfaction of the Office, the

Office shall notify the Defendant of the release of the Monitor, and the Defendant shall within 30

25
calendar days of such notice recommend a pool of three qualified Monitor candidates from
which the Fraud Section and EDNY will choose a replacement.
32. The Monitorâs term shall be three years from the date on which the Monitor is

retained by the Defendant, subject to extension or early termination as described in Paragraph 1.

[INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK]

25A
The Monitorâs powers, duties, and responsibilities, as well as additional circumstances that may
support an extension of the Monitorâs term, are set forth in Attachment D. The Defendant agrees
that it will not employ or be affiliated with the Monitor or the Monitorâs firm for a period of not
less than two years from the date on which the Monitorâs term expires. Nor will the Defendant
discuss with the Monitor or the Monitorâs firm the possibility of further employment or
affiliation during the Monitorâs term.
COMPLETE AGREEMENT

33. This document, including its attachments, states the full extent of the Agreement
between the parties. There are no other promises or agreements, express or implied. Any
modification of this Agreement shall be valid only if set forth in writing in a supplemental or
revised plea agreement signed by all parties.

EXHIBIT 1
CERTIFICATE OF CORPORATE RESOLUTIONS

 

WHEREAS, Braskem S.A. (the âCompanyâ) has been engaged in discussions with the United States
Department of Justice, Criminal Division, Fraud Section and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District
of New York (collectively the âFraud Section and EDNYâ or the âOfficesâ), regarding issues arising in relation
to certain improper corrupt payments to foreign officials in Brazil to assist in obtaining and/or retaining

STATEMENT OF FACTS

The following Statement of Facts is incorporated by reference as part of the Plea
Agreement (the âAgreementâ) between the United States Department of Justice, Criminal
Division, Fraud Section, the United States Attorneyâs Office for the Eastern District of New
York, and the defendant Braskem S.A. (âBraskemâ or the âCompanyâ). Braskem hereby agrees
and stipulates that the following information is true and accurate. Certain of the facts herein are

OVERVIEW OF THE BRIBERY SCHEME

24. Beginning in or about and between 2002 and 2014, Braskem knowingly and
willfully conspired and agreed with others to corruptly provide millions of dollars in payments
to, and for the benefit of, foreign officials, foreign political parties, foreign political party
officials and foreign political candidates to secure an improper advantage and to influence those
foreign officials, foreign political parties, and foreign political candidates in order to obtain and
retain business in Brazil.

25. â Specifically, during this period, Braskem authorized a division of Odebrecht
known as the Division of Structured Operations, described below, to pay bribes to Brazilian
politicians and political parties, as well as to an official at Petrobras, in exchange for helping

Braskem maintain a joint venture contract with Petrobras, a reduction in pricing for raw
materials that Braskem purchased from Petrobras, as well as reductions in Braskemâs tax
liabilities, and other benefits.

26. Odebrecht created and funded an elaborate, secret financial structure that operated
to account for and disburse corrupt bribe payments to, and for the benefit of, foreign officials and
foreign political parties. Over time, the development and operation of this secret financial
structure evolved, and in or about 2006, Odebrecht established the Division of Structured
Operations, a standalone division within the company. The Division of Structured Operations
effectively functioned as a bribe department within Odebrecht. To conceal its activities, the
Division of Structured Operations utilized an entirely separate and off-book communications
system, which allowed members of the Division of Structured Operations to communicate with
one another and with outside financial operators and others about the bribes through the use of
secure emails and instant messages, utilizing codenames and passwords.

27. Toconceal Braskemâs criminal conduct and corrupt payments, Braskem provided
funds to the Division of Structured Operations. Once Braskem sent funds to the Division of
Structured Operations, the Division of Structured Operations funneled the funds into a series of
offshore entities that were not listed as related entities on Braskemâs balance sheet, and the funds
were no longer recorded on Braskemâs financial statements. Braskem, through the Division of
Structure Operations, concealed and disguised corrupt payments made to, and for the benefit of,
foreign officials and foreign political parties in Brazil. Many of the transactions were layered
through multiple levels of offshore entities and bank accounts throughout the world, often
transferring the illicit funds through up to four levels of offshore bank accounts before reaching
the final recipient. In this regard, members of the conspiracy sought to distance the origin of the

funds from the final beneficiaries.

B-7
28. The funds were also disbursed by financial operators who acted on behalf of the
Division of Structured Operations, including but not limited to the beneficial owners of the
accounts and/or doleiros (also known as money traders, who function to exchange Brazilian
Reais for United States dollars), who delivered the payments in cash in Brazil or other foreign
countries, in packages or suitcases at locations predetermined by the beneficiary of the funds; or
made the payments via wire transfer through one or more of the unrelated offshore entities.

29.  Braskem initially benefitted from the operation of the Division of Structured
Operations, as well as a slush fund that was the precursor to the Division of Structured
Operations (which was managed by an Odebrecht subsidiary, Construtora Norberto Odebrecht
(âCNOâ)), due to its status as an Odebrecht subsidiary. That is, before 2006, Odebrecht
executives associated with Braskem directed the Division of Structured Operations and/or the
slush fund operators to make corrupt payments to support Braskemâs financial and political
interests although Braskem was not contributing directly to the Division of Structured Operations
or the slush fund at that time. Specifically, Odebrecht executives directed the Division of
Structured Operations and/or the slush fund to make payments to various government officials in
connection with the consolidation of the petrochemical sector under Braskemâs control.
However, by approximately 2006, Braskemâs most senior executives and Board members
determined that Braskem would start generating its own unrecorded funds to deposit into the
Division of Structured Operations.

30. Specifically, in approximately May or June 2006, Braskem Employee 4 â then a
high-level executive at Braskem â approached Braskem Employee 2 and advised Braskem
Employee 2 that Braskem needed to generate its own unrecorded funds to make payments to

government officials in support of its own strategic goals. At a subsequent meeting, Braskem

B-8
Employee 2 and Braskem Employee 4 instructed Braskem Employee 7, then a high-level finance
executive at Braskem, to create a system for Braskem to generate unrecorded funds that could be
paid into the Division of Structured Operations. Braskem Employee 7, in turn, hired both an
attorney and a Swiss citizen with banking experience to set up that system. Braskem generated
unrecorded funds to deposit into the Division of Structured Operations by making payments
pursuant to fabricated âcommissionsâ contracts with three fictitious import and export agents.
Braskem used its bank accounts in Brazil and New York-based bank accounts held by Braskem
Incorporated to pay offshore shell companies ostensibly held by the fictitious export and import
agents. Braskem, under the guise of the fictitious agents, then directed the money to accounts
held by the Division of Structured Operations.

31. In general, certain individuals serving as officers at Braskem â including Braskem
Employee 4, Braskem Employee 5, and Braskem Employee 6 â had autonomy in managing
Braskemâs Division of Structured Operations deposits and disbursements. Certain individuals
serving as high-level financial executives at Braskem â including Braskem Employee 6 â were
responsible for monitoring the generation of unrecorded funds. A Braskem employee in the
Companyâs financial division oversaw the transfer of unrecorded funds to the Division of
Structured Operations from the offshore shell companies, and periodically met with members of
Braskem Agent 2âs team to check on Braskemâs Division of Structured Operations balance.
Payments from the Division of Structured Operations at Braskemâs direction were made by
Braskem Agent 2âs team.

32. In total, Braskem diverted approximately R$513 millionâ (equivalent to $250

million) into offshore shell companies for transfer into accounts managed by the Division of

1 âR$â denotes Brazilian Reais, the currency of Brazil.

B-9
Structured Operations, and it also directed the Division of Structured Operations to make bribe
payments on its behalf. Approximately $75 million of the money Braskem paid into the Division
of Structured Operations was used to make bribe payments to secure benefits to Braskem of
approximately $289 million, including, as described below, corrupt payments to a Petrobras
executive and corrupt payments to other government officials in Brazil. Braskem also paid an
additional $175 million into the Division of Structured Operations for which a direct benefit has
not been identified but which payments otherwise reflect a failure of the Companyâs internal
controls and a falsification of the Companyâs books and records.

33.  Braskem, through certain executives and employees, falsely recorded the
payments that were diverted into the Division of Structured Operations-managed bank accounts
on, among other things, Braskemâs general ledger and electronic finance system as
âcommissions for agents,â and knowingly and willfully created fake and fraudulent agency
contracts and other documentation in order to mask the true purpose of these payments.

34. In furtherance of the conspiracy, and to execute the corrupt payments, beginning
in or about and between 2006 and 2014, Braskem, through certain employees and agents, caused
wire transfers to be made from bank accounts located in Brazil and the United States, into shell
company accounts located outside the United States. These payments to the offshore shell
companies were subsequently transferred to the Division of Structured Operations. The
following are two examples of such payments:

a. On or about April 28, 2014, Braskem made a payment in the amount of
$1,611,120.95 from a New York-based bank account held by Braskem Incorporated to an

offshore shell company controlled by Braskem.
b. On or about April 30, 2014, Braskem made a payment in the amount of
$1,405,489.26 from a second New York-based bank account held by Braskem Incorporated to an
offshore shell company controlled by Braskem.

35.  Braskem, through its agents, also took acts in furtherance of the corrupt scheme
while in the territory of the United States. For example, some of the offshore entities that the
Division of Structured Operations used to hold and disburse unrecorded funds were established,
owned and/or operated by individuals located in the United States.

BRASKEMâS CORRUPT PAYMENTS TO FOREIGN OFFICIALS

36. During the relevant period, Braskem together with its co-conspirators, made
payments to various government officials in the Brazilian government with the understanding
that such payments would serve as, in essence, a retainer that would permit Braskem and its co-
conspirators to call in favors when necessary to assist with Braskemâs business.

37.  Inaddition, Braskem made corrupt payments in connection with specific contracts
and benefits that Braskem sought in Brazil. A number of these specific payments, contracts and
benefits are described more fully below.

Approval of Favorable Tax Legislation

38. In approximately 2006, a series of judicial rulings in Brazil called into question
the applicability of certain tax credits. As a result, Braskem faced a potentially significant
increase in its tax liability. In response, Odebrecht and Braskem took a number of steps to
ensure the passage of legislation that would mitigate the loss of such credits on Braskemâs
overall tax liabilities.

39. First, Braskem Employee 1 directed Braskem Employee 3 to reach out to

Brazilian Official 3. Braskem Employee 3 made contact, asking Brazilian Official 3 to both
intercede with a Brazilian minister, and to advise a member of Brazilian Official 1âs staff to
prepare Brazilian Official 1 to approve a legislative solution approved by Odebrecht and
Braskem. Both individuals agreed to help Braskem Employee 3.

40. At the same time, another Odebrecht executive spoke directly to Brazilian Official
1, and asked Brazilian Official 1 to exert influence over Brazilian Official 4. Braskem Employee
1 then met directly with Brazilian Official 4 on several occasions to press the issue. At one of
those meetings, Brazilian Official 4 asked Braskem Employee 1 for a contribution to Brazilian
Official 2âs upcoming political campaign in exchange for the officialâs assistance. Specifically,
Brazilian Official 4 wrote down the amount âR$50 millionâ on a piece of paper and slid it across
the table to Braskem Employee 1. Braskem Employee 1 discussed the bribe request with
Braskem Employee 5; given the potential impact of the resolution on Braskem, Braskem
Employee 5 agreed that Braskem would pay the bribe. Although the request was framed as a
contribution to Brazilian Official 2âs campaign, Braskem Employee 1 knew that the funds were
not going to be used for the campaign. Rather, Braskem Employee | understood that they would
be distributed after the next election for the personal benefit of various politicians.

41. As a result of these efforts, in or about 2009, a solution was reached in the form of
a program that would, in effect, allow companies to employ an accounting rule to reduce tax
liabilities in a similar fashion as the original tax credits. That program was subsequently
incorporated into legislation that was converted into law in approximately 2010. Braskem
benefitted from these measures, and was permitted to use the rule to reduce its tax liabilities.

42.  Braskem subsequently used the Division of Structured Operations to make the

R$50 million bribe payment to Brazilian Official 2âs political campaign with unrecorded funds.
The Company also used the Division of Structured Operations to pay R$14 million to Brazilian
Official 3 for the officialâs efforts.
Confirmation of Favorable Tax Treatment For Raw Materials

43. In or about 2008, state officials in a region where Braskem operated a
petrochemical plant took the position that a particular tax should be paid in connection with
Braskemâs use of raw materials at the plant. Braskem disagreed with the officialsâ position, and
argued that the tax did not apply. Braskemâs refusal to pay the tax caused the state officials to
restrict Braskemâs receipt of certain raw materials, which threatened Braskemâs operation of the
plant.

44,  Braskem attempted to resolve the issue by making its case to state and federal
officials through formal channels that the tax did not apply. At the same time, however,
Braskem also sought to leverage the bribes it had been making on a regular basis to Brazilian
officials to help secure a favorable outcome of this issue. Specifically, Braskem Employee 3
asked Brazilian Official 3, a recipient of many of the recurring corrupt payments from the
Division of Structured Operations, for the officialâs support and influence to get a regulatory
action settling the matter. Brazilian Official 3 agreed, and Braskem Employee 3 gave him
specific language to include in the regulation.

45. Based on these efforts, in or about December 2008, the federal government
published a decree which clarified that the tax in question did not apply to the raw materials used
by Braskem. Based on that statement, Braskem was able to resume normal operation of its plant.

Retention of Petrobras Contract
46.  Inor about 2005, Braskem signed a series of contracts with Petrobras to complete

a significant petrochemical project. Braskem subsequently became concerned that Petrobras
would not honor those contracts, and would instead try to give the project to one of Braskemâs
competitors.

47.  Inresponse, Braskem Employee 4 directed Braskem Employee 3 to raise the
matter with Brazilian Official 6, and to take steps to ensure Braskem would retain the project.
Braskem Employee 3 had a series of meetings with Brazilian Official 5 and Brazilian Official 6,
at which both asked for bribes in return for assistance. After negotiations, they settled on a
payment of R$4.3 million, which would be conditioned on Braskem maintaining all of the
contracts with Petrobras related to the project. Braskem Employee 3 further stipulated that no
payments would be made until certain aspects of the project were actually underway.

48.  Braskem Employee 3 brought the bribe proposal to Braskem Employee 4 for
approval, and Braskem Employee 4 agreed. Petrobras ultimately honored its contracts with
Braskem, and the project proceeded. Thereafter, Braskem authorized Braskem Agent 2âs team to
make the agreed-upon payments to Brazilian Official 5 and Brazilian Official 6. The payments
totaling R$4.3 million were paid in installments in approximately 2007 and 2008, via
international wire transfers paid to foreign accounts.

Naphtha Supply Contract

49. In or about mid-2008, Braskem and Petrobras began to negotiate a new long-term
contract for naphtha (a colorless, volatile petroleum distillate that is a raw material for certain of
Braskemâs petrochemical operations). The technical teams from each company proposed and
then debated various pricing formulas for the contract. Petrobras initially proposed a pricing
formula based on an international industry standard reference that resulted in a higher price for
Petrobras. Braskem rejected this proposal, and instead proposed a formula that was a variation

on that standard that resulted in a lower price for Braskem.

B-14
50. At this point, Braskem Employee 5 asked Braskem Employee 3 to seek Brazilian
Official 6âs assistance in moving the negotiations along. Braskem Employee 3 met with
Brazilian Official 5 and Brazilian Official 6, who agreed to assist Braskem by getting Brazilian
Official 5 to put pressure on Petrobras to reduce the naphtha price to Braskem. In return,
Braskem Employee 3 promised to pay Brazilian Official 5 and Brazilian Official 6 a bribe of $12
million via the Division of Structured Operations.

51. â After several additional rounds of negotiation, during which Brazilian Official 5
became involved in the process, both parties agreed to a new formula that reduced the price of
naphtha for Braskem. This formula was presented to Petrobrasâs Executive Board on or about
March 12, 2009. Although the Petrobras Executive Board signed off on many of the agreed-
upon contract conditions, it changed the formula terms to increase the price of naphtha. Braskem
rejected this change, indicating that the formula could not be changed without reopening the
negotiation process.

52.  Braskem Employee 5 asked Braskem Employee 3 to go back to Brazilian Official
6 and seek further assistance. Braskem Employee 3 told Brazilian Official 6 that Braskem would
not pay the $12 million unless the Petrobras-Braskem naphtha contract included a price that was
more beneficial to Braskem. Brazilian Official 6 agreed to ask Brazilian Official 5 once again to
intervene on behalf of Braskem. Thereafter, Brazilian Official 5 personally intervened, and
ensured that the negotiation process was held open until the next meeting of the Petrobras
Executive Board the following month. Brazilian Official 5 also arranged a meeting at
Petrobrasâs headquarters between Brazilian Official 5, Braskem Employee 1, Braskem Employee

5 and an executive officer of Petrobras, at which Braskem was able to make a general

B-15
presentation directly to the executive officer about the alignment of Braskemâs and Petrobrasâs
interests.

53. Following the meeting, at the direction of Brazilian Official 5, Braskem agreed to
negotiate financial reciprocities with Petrobras to justify the reducing of the price of naphtha to
the level that Braskem wanted. Ultimately, Petrobras agreed to a formula that over the course of
the contract would have the net effect of reducing the price of the naphtha that Braskem
purchased. The contract was finalized in approximately July 2009.

54. Shortly thereafter, Braskem, via the Division of Structured Operations, began to
make payments in installments on the $12 million bribe to Brazilian Official 5 and Brazilian
Official 6. Specifically, Braskem Employee 3 received foreign bank account numbers from an
intermediary for Brazilian Official 5 and Brazilian Official 6, and passed them on to a member of
Braskem Agent 2âs team, who in turn would make the payments via international wire transfer.
These payments continued even after Brazilian Official 6âs death and Braskem Employee 5âs
departure from Braskem in or about 2010; in this later period, the payments were overseen by
Braskem Employee 5âs successor, Braskem Employee 6. The full amount of the bribe was not
paid until approximately mid-2011.

Tax Credit Negotiations in Certain Brazilian States

55; In the mid-2000s, due to its business model, Braskem began to accumulate tax
credits at a particularly high rate in certain Brazilian states in which it operated. If Braskem went
ahead and used those accumulated credits as anticipated, it would cease to generate any tax
revenue for those states. By approximately 2008, the imbalance had gotten so pronounced that
the state governments started to threaten Braskem with significant increases in other taxes. Asa

result, Braskem sought to resolve the matter both by entering into legitimate negotiations with

B-16
state officials, and by making significant campaign contributions to corruptly influence state
government officialsâ decisions with respect to the tax issue. Braskem benefited from these
corrupt payments, which ensured a favorable outcome; while the states were able to collect some
revenue from Braskem, the Company continued to benefit significantly from the tax credits.

56. For example, in one state, Braskem entered into a series of agreements in which it
agreed to (1) limit the use of its accumulated tax credits, (2) invest more than R$1 billion in
infrastructure projects, and (3) create jobs in the state, all in exchange for the state not changing
the tax structure so that Braskem and similarly-situated companies could continue to use their
remaining credits without penalty. Brazilian Official 9 and Braskem Employee 5, acting on
Braskemâs behalf, signed off on these agreements.

57. During the negotiation of these agreements, Braskem Employee 3 separately
negotiated the payment, with a relative of Brazilian Official 9, of substantial official
contributions by Braskem to Brazilian Official 9âs campaigns for state office, resulting in a
R$200,000 contribution in connection with Brazilian Official 9âs 2006 campaign and a
R$600,000 payment in connection with Brazilian Official 9âs 2010 reelection campaign.
Braskem Employee 3 understood that these payments were provided in exchange for Brazilian
Official 9 signing the series of tax credit agreements with Braskem.

58. Similarly, in or about and between 2008 and 2009, Braskem reached an
agreement with another Brazilian state that the Company would limit its use of tax credits in
return for investing more than R$650 million in infrastructure projects in that state. The high-
level official responsible for the negotiations that resulted in that agreement had previously
received campaign contributions from Odebrecht for the 2006 election totaling R$3 million

through a combination of official donations and donations of unrecorded funds from the Division

B-17
of Structured Operations. The purpose of those donations was to secure the officialâs assistance
on issues that affected Odebrecht and its related entities, including Braskem, such as the
resolution of Braskemâs accumulated tax credits.

Approval of Favorable Tax Incentive Legislation

59.  Inor about 2010, several Brazilian states began to offer certain tax incentives that
Braskem believed would cause it to be less competitive in those states. Braskem considered the
issue a top priority, and mobilized along several parallel tracks to eliminate such incentives.
Braskem Agent 1 handled discussions with the Brazilian Congress, primarily through Brazilian
Official 7, and Braskem Employee | attempted to influence the executive branch, primarily
through meetings with Brazilian Official 4.

60. Subsequently, Brazilian Official 4 appointed Brazilian Official 7 as the person
responsible to draft and oversee legislation that would help Braskem reduce or eliminate the tax
incentives. As the legislation progressed, Braskem Agent | kept tabs on the process, speaking
frequently to Brazilian Official 7 and other members of Congress. In March 2012, Braskem
Employee 6 met with a number of Brazilian legislators, including Brazilian Official 7 and
Brazilian Official 8, to discuss the specifics of the legislation. Braskem understood that it
needed to pay bribes to Brazilian Official 7 and other officials in order to secure their support in
connection with the legislation.

61. Subsequently, legislation was passed that reduced the ability of the states to grant
the tax incentives. As soon as the legislation was finalized, Braskem Agent | notified Braskem
Employee 6 and Braskem Employee | that Braskem needed to approve the release of unrecorded
funds to fulfill commitments with certain members of Congress who had voted for the measure.

Braskem Employee 6 then spoke to Braskem Agent 2 and authorized the release of R$4 million

B-18
from the Division of Structured Operations to be disbursed at Braskem Agent 1âs direction.
Braskem Agent 1 advised Braskem Employee 6 that Brazilian Official 7 was one of the
recipients of the unrecorded funds.

62. After the initial disbursement of funds from the Division of Structured
Operations was made to certain legislators, Braskem Employee 6 was notified that another
member of Congress involved in the legislation had complained that he deserved a R$500,000
payment from Braskem for the legislatorâs work getting the measure approved. Braskem
Employee 6 authorized the payment to the legislator, and Division of Structured Operations paid
the legislator with unrecorded funds.

Approval of Favorable Tax Exemption Legislation

63. In or about 2011, Braskem sought to persuade the government to implement a
new tax exemption that would benefit petrochemical companies like Braskem. Odebrecht and
Braskem approached securing this exemption on several fronts. Braskem Employee 6 focused
on garnering industry support for the exemption; Braskem Agent 1 dealt with members of
Congress; and Braskem Employee 1 handled discussions with the executive branch, specifically
Brazilian Official 4. As a result of their efforts, legislation that included the tax exemption was
introduced in Congress in approximately 2013. However, issues arose as the legislation
progressed towards a vote. First, an amendment was added to the legislation that was unpopular
with many of the legislators. To eliminate the amendment, Braskem Employee | called
Brazilian Official 4, who in turn placed Braskem Employee 1 in touch with an aide to a
government official. Braskem Employee 1 convinced the aide to drop the unpopular

amendment.
64. However, the legislation was effectively stalled by a request made by a high-level
official in the legislative branch, who proposed eliminating a different amendment. In response,
Braskem Agent | contacted Braskem Employee 6 and Braskem Employee 1, and conveyed that
Braskem needed to pay significant sums to various members of Congress in order to get the
request lifted and to move the legislation along. Braskem Employee 6 approved the request and
told Braskem Agent 2 to make unrecorded funds from the Division of Structured Operations
available to Braskem Agent 1. After the funds were disbursed, the high-level official lifted the
request to eliminate the amendment, and the legislation was passed.

65. Braskem Agent 1 subsequently advised Braskem Employee 6 that the payments
were divided among a number of members of Congress. Specifically, approximately R$2.1
million had been paid to the high-level official who had proposed eliminating an amendment;
approximately R$4 million had been paid to Brazilian Official 7 (who Braskem Agent | believed
shared the funds with Brazilian Official 8); approximately R$1 to $1.5 million had been paid to a
high-level official in the legislative branch; and approximately R$100,000 had been paid to a
second high-level official in the legislative branch.

66. âInaddition, while Brazilian Official 4 received no specific compensation for the
officialâs role in ensuring the passage of the legislation, Braskem was required to pay an
additional R$100 million above and beyond what Braskem Employee 1 had previously agreed
with Brazilian Official 4 to pay to the officialâs political party and to members of the federal
government. This increase was negotiated by Brazilian Official 4 and primarily went to

contributions for party members in the 2014 campaigns.

In order to address any deficiencies in its internal controls, compliance code, policies,
and procedures regarding compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (âFCPAâ), 15
U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78dd-1, et seg., and other applicable anti-corruption laws, Braskem S.A. (the
âCompanyâ) agrees to continue to conduct, in a manner consistent with all of its obligations
under this Agreement, appropriate reviews of its existing internal controls, policies, and
procedures.

Where necessary and appropriate, the Company agrees to adopt a new compliance
program, or to modify its existing one, including internal controls, compliance policies, and
procedures in order to ensure that it maintains: (a) an effective system of internal accounting
controls designed to ensure the making and keeping of fair and accurate books, records, and
accounts; and (b) a rigorous anti-corruption compliance program that incorporates relevant
internal accounting controls, as well as policies and procedures designed to effectively detect and
deter violations of the FCPA and other applicable anti-corruption laws. At a minimum, this
should include, but not be limited to, the following elements to the extent they are not already
part of the Companyâs existing internal controls, compliance code, policies, and procedures:

High-Level Commitment

1. The Company will ensure that its directors and senior management provide

strong, explicit, and visible support and commitment to its corporate policy against violations of

the anti-corruption laws and its compliance code.
Policies and Procedures

2: The Company will develop and promulgate a clearly articulated and visible
corporate policy against violations of the FCPA and other applicable foreign law counterparts
(collectively, the âanti-corruption laws,â), which policy shall be memorialized in a written
compliance code.

3. The Company will develop and promulgate compliance policies and procedures
designed to reduce the prospect of violations of the anti-corruption laws and the Companyâs
compliance code, and the Company will take appropriate measures to encourage and support the
observance of ethics and compliance policies and procedures against violation of the anti-
corruption laws by personnel at all levels of the Company. These anti-corruption policies and
procedures shall apply to all directors, officers, and employees and, where necessary and
appropriate, outside parties acting on behalf of the Company in a foreign jurisdiction, including
but not limited to, agents and intermediaries, consultants, representatives, distributors, teaming
partners, contractors and suppliers, consortia, and joint venture partners (collectively, âagents

to provide reasonable assurances that:

a. transactions are executed in accordance with managementâs general or
specific authorization;

b. transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles or any other criteria
applicable to such statements, and to maintain accountability for assets;

general or specific authorization; and

d. the recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets
at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences.

Periodic Risk-Based Review

basis of a periodic risk assessment addressing the individual circumstances of the Company, in
particular the foreign bribery risks facing the Company, including, but not limited to, its
geographical organization, interactions with various types and levels of government officials,

industrial sectors of operation, involvement in joint venture arrangements, importance of licenses

C-3
and permits in the Companyâs operations, degree of governmental oversight and inspection, and
volume and importance of goods and personnel clearing through customs and immigration.

procedures no less than annually and update them as appropriate to ensure their continued
effectiveness, taking into account relevant developments in the field and evolving international
and industry standards.

executives of the Company for the implementation and oversight of the Companyâs anti-
corruption compliance code, policies, and procedures. Such corporate official(s) shall have the
authority to report directly to independent monitoring bodies, including internal audit, the
Companyâs Board of Directors, or any appropriate committee of the Board of Directors, and
shall have an adequate level of autonomy from management as well as sufficient resources and
authority to maintain such autonomy.

Training and Guidance

directors, officers, employees, and, where necessary and appropriate, agents and business
partners. These mechanisms shall include: (a) periodic training for all directors and officers, all
employees in positions of leadership or trust, positions that require such training (e.g., internal
audit, sales, legal, compliance, finance), or positions that otherwise pose a corruption risk to the

Company, and, where necessary and appropriate, agents and business partners; and (b)

C-4
corresponding certifications by all such directors, officers, employees, agents, and business
partners, certifying compliance with the training requirements.

9. The Company will maintain, or where necessary establish, an effective system
for providing guidance and advice to directors, officers, employees, and, where necessary and
appropriate, agents and business partners, on complying with the Companyâs anti-corruption
compliance code, policies, and procedures, including when they need advice on an urgent basis
or in any foreign jurisdiction in which the Company operates.

Internal Reporting and Investigation

10. The Company will maintain, or where necessary establish, an effective system
for internal and, where possible, confidential reporting by, and protection of, directors, officers,
employees, and, where appropriate, agents and business partners concerning violations of the
anti-corruption laws or the Companyâs anti-corruption compliance code, policies, and
procedures.

11. The Company will maintain, or where necessary establish, an effective and
reliable process with sufficient resources for responding to, investigating, and documenting

compliance code, policies, and procedures, including appropriately incentivizing compliance and

disciplining violations.

C-5
13. | The Company will institute appropriate disciplinary procedures to address,
among other things, violations of the anti-corruption laws and the Companyâs anti-corruption
compliance code, policies, and procedures by the Companyâs directors, officers, and employees.

perceived importance of, the director, officer, or employee. The Company shall implement
procedures to ensure that where misconduct is discovered, reasonable steps are taken to remedy
the harm resulting from such misconduct, and to ensure that appropriate steps are taken to
prevent further similar misconduct, including assessing the internal controls, compliance code,
policies, and procedures and making modifications necessary to ensure the overall anti-
corruption compliance program is effective.

Third-Party Relationships

requirements pertaining to the retention and oversight of all agents and business partners,
including:

a. properly documented due diligence pertaining to the hiring and

upon the circumstances, include: (a) anti-corruption representations and undertakings relating to
compliance with the anti-corruption laws; (b) rights to conduct audits of the books and records of
the agent or business partner to ensure compliance with the foregoing; and (c) rights to terminate

procedures regarding the anti-corruption laws apply as quickly as is practicable to newly
acquired businesses or entities merged with the Company and will promptly:

a. train the directors, officers, employees, agents, and business partners
consistent with Paragraph 8 above on the anti-corruption laws and the Companyâs compliance
code, policies, and procedures regarding anti-corruption laws; and

b. where warranted, conduct an FCPA-specific audit of all newly acquired

or merged businesses as quickly as practicable.
Monitoring and Testing

compliance code, policies, and procedures designed to evaluate and improve their effectiveness
in preventing and detecting violations of anti-corruption laws and the Companyâs anti-corruption
code, policies, and procedures, taking into account relevant developments in the field and

evolving international and industry standards.
ATTACHMENT D
INDEPENDENT COMPLIANCE MONITOR

The duties and authority of the Independent Compliance Monitor (the âMonitorâ), and
the obligations of Braskem S.A. (the âCompanyâ), on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries and
affiliates, with respect to the Monitor and the United States Department of Justice, Criminal
Division, Fraud Section and the United States Attorneyâs Office for the Eastern District of New
York (collectively the âDepartmentâ), are as described below:

1. The Company will retain the Monitor for a period of three years (the âTerm of the
Monitorshipâ), unless the early termination provision of Paragraph 1 of the Plea Agreement (the
âAgreementâ) is triggered.

Monitorâs Mandate

2. The Monitorâs primary responsibility is to assess and monitor the Companyâs
compliance with the terms of the Agreement, including the Corporate Compliance Program in
Attachment C, so as to specifically address and reduce the risk of any recurrence of the
Companyâs misconduct. During the Term of the Monitorship, the Monitor will evaluate, in the
manner set forth below, the effectiveness of the internal accounting controls, record-keeping, and
financial reporting policies and procedures of the Company as they relate to the Companyâs
current and ongoing compliance with the FCPA and other applicable anti-corruption laws
(collectively, the âanti-corruption lawsâ) and take such reasonable steps as, in his or her view,
may be necessary to fulfill the foregoing mandate (the âMandateâ). This Mandate shall include

an assessment of the Board of Directorsâ and senior managementâs commitment to, and effective

D-1
implementation of, the corporate compliance program described in Attachment C of the
Agreement.
Companyâs Obligations

3: The Company shall cooperate fully with the Monitor, and the Monitor shall have
the authority to take such reasonable steps as, in his or her view, may be necessary to be fully
informed about the Companyâs compliance program in accordance with the principles set forth
herein and applicable law, including applicable data protection and labor laws and regulations.
To that end, the Company shall: facilitate the Monitorâs access to the Companyâs documents and
resources; not limit such access, except as provided in Paragraphs 5-6; and provide guidance on
applicable local law (such as relevant data protection and labor laws). The Company shall
provide the Monitor with access to all information, documents, records, facilities, and
employees, as reasonably requested by the Monitor, that fall within the scope of the Mandate of
the Monitor under the Agreement. The Company shall use its best efforts to provide the Monitor
with access to the Companyâs former employees and its third-party vendors, agents, and
consultants.

4. Any disclosure by the Company to the Monitor concerning corrupt payments,
false books and records, and internal accounting control failures shall not relieve the Company of
any otherwise applicable obligation to truthfully disclose such matters to the Department,
pursuant to the Agreement.

Withholding Access
5. The parties agree that no attorney-client relationship shall be formed between the

Company and the Monitor. In the event that the Company seeks to withhold from the Monitor

D-2
access to information, documents, records, facilities, or current or former employees of the
Company that may be subject to a claim of attorney-client privilege or to the attorney work-
product doctrine, or where the Company reasonably believes production would otherwise be
inconsistent with applicable law, the Company shall work cooperatively with the Monitor to
resolve the matter to the satisfaction of the Monitor.

6. If the matter cannot be resolved, at the request of the Monitor, the Company shall
promptly provide written notice to the Monitor and the Department. Such notice shall include a
general description of the nature of the information, documents, records, facilities or current or
former employees that are being withheld, as well as the legal basis for withholding access. The
Department may then consider whether to make a further request for access to such information,
documents, records, facilities, or employees.

Monitorâs Coordination with the
Company and Review Methodology

Ts In carrying out the Mandate, to the extent appropriate under the circumstances,
the Monitor should coordinate with Company personnel, including in-house counsel, compliance
personnel, and internal auditors, on an ongoing basis. The Monitor may rely on the product of
the Companyâs processes, such as the results of studies, reviews, sampling and testing
methodologies, audits, and analyses conducted by or on behalf of the Company, as well as the
Companyâs internal resources (e.g., legal, compliance, and internal audit), which can assist the
Monitor in carrying out the Mandate through increased efficiency and Company-specific
expertise, provided that the Monitor has confidence in the quality of those resources.

8. The Monitorâs reviews should use a risk-based approach, and thus, the Monitor is
not expected to conduct a comprehensive review of all business lines, all business activities, or

D-3
all markets. In carrying out the Mandate, the Monitor should consider, for instance, risks
presented by: (a) the countries and industries in which the Company operates; (b) current and
future business opportunities and transactions; (c) current and potential business partners,
including third parties and joint ventures, and the business rationale for such relationships; (d)
the Companyâs gifts, travel, and entertainment interactions with foreign officials; and (e) the
Companyâs involvement with foreign officials, including the amount of foreign government
regulation and oversight of the Company, such as licensing and permitting, and the Companyâs
exposure to customs and immigration issues in conducting its business affairs.

9. In undertaking the reviews to carry out the Mandate, the Monitor shall formulate
conclusions based on, among other things: (a) inspection of relevant documents, including the
Companyâs current anti-corruption policies and procedures; (b) on-site observation of selected
systems and procedures of the Company at sample sites, including internal accounting controls,
record-keeping, and internal audit procedures; (c) meetings with, and interviews of, relevant
current and, where appropriate, former directors, officers, employees, business partners, agents,
and other persons at mutually convenient times and places; and (d) analyses, studies, and testing
of the Companyâs compliance program.

Monitorâs Written Work Plans

10. To carry out the Mandate, during the Term of the Monitorship, the Monitor shall
conduct an initial review and prepare an initial report, followed by at least two follow-up reviews
and reports as described in Paragraphs 16-19 below. With respect to the initial report, after
consultation with the Company and the Department, the Monitor shall prepare the first written

work plan within 60 calendar days of being retained, and the Company and the Department shall

D-4
provide comments within 30 calendar days after receipt of the written work plan. With respect
to each follow-up report, after consultation with the Company and the Department, the Monitor
shall prepare a written work plan at least 30 calendar days prior to commencing a review, and the
Company and the Department shall provide comments within 20calendar days after receipt of the
written work plan. Any disputes between the Company and the Monitor with respect to any
written work plan shall be decided by the Department in its sole discretion.

11. All written work plans shall identify with reasonable specificity the activities the
Monitor plans to undertake in execution of the Mandate, including a written request for
documents. The Monitorâs work plan for the initial review shall include such steps as are
reasonably necessary to conduct an effective initial review in accordance with the Mandate,
including by developing an understanding, to the extent the Monitor deems appropriate, of the
facts and circumstances surrounding any violations that may have occurred before the date of the
Agreement. In developing such understanding the Monitor is to rely to the extent possible on
available information and documents provided by the Company. It is not intended that the
Monitor will conduct his or her own inquiry into the historical events that gave rise to the
Agreement.

Initial Review

12. The initial review shall commence no later than 120 calendar days from the date
of the engagement of the Monitor (unless otherwise agreed by the Company, the Monitor, and
the Department). The Monitor shall issue a written report within 150 calendar days of
commencing the initial review, setting forth the Monitorâs assessment and, if necessary, making

recommendations reasonably designed to improve the effectiveness of the Companyâs program

D-5
for ensuring compliance with the anti-corruption laws. The Monitor should consult with the
Company concerning his or her findings and recommendations on an ongoing basis and should
consider the Companyâs comments and input to the extent the Monitor deems appropriate. The
Monitor may also choose to share a draft of his or her reports with the Company prior to
finalizing them. The Monitorâs reports need not recite or describe comprehensively the
Companyâs history or compliance policies, procedures and practices, but rather may focus on
those areas with respect to which the Monitor wishes to make recommendations, if any, for
improvement or which the Monitor otherwise concludes merit particular attention. The Monitor
shall provide the report to the Board of Directors of the Company and contemporaneously
transmit copies to the Deputy Chief - FCPA Unit, Fraud Section, Criminal Division, U.S.
Department of Justice, at 1400 New York Avenue N.W., Bond Building, Eleventh Floor,
Washington, D.C. 20005 and Chief, Business and Securities Fraud Section, United States
Attorneyâs Office, Eastern District of New York, 271-A Cadman Plaza East, Brooklyn, New
York 11201. After consultation with the Company, the Monitor may extend the time period for
issuance of the initial report for a brief period of time with prior written approval of the
Department.

13. | Within 150 calendar days after receiving the Monitorâs initial report, the
Company shall adopt and implement all recommendations in the report, unless, within 60
calendar days of receiving the report, the Company notifies in writing the Monitor and the
Department of any recommendations that the Company considers unduly burdensome,
inconsistent with applicable law or regulation, impractical, excessively expensive, or otherwise

inadvisable. With respect to any such recommendation, the Company need not adopt that

D-6
recommendation within the 150 calendar days of receiving the report but shall propose in writing
to the Monitor and the Department an alternative policy, procedure or system designed to
achieve the same objective or purpose. As to any recommendation on which the Company and
the Monitor do not agree, such parties shall attempt in good faith to reach an agreement within
45 calendar days after the Company serves the written notice.

14. In the event the Company and the Monitor are unable to agree on an acceptable
alternative proposal, the Company shall promptly consult with the Department. The Department
may consider the Monitorâs recommendation and the Companyâs reasons for not adopting the
recommendation in determining whether the Company has fully complied with its obligations
under the Agreement. Pending such determination, the Company shall not be required to
implement any contested recommendation(s).

15. With respect to any recommendation that the Monitor determines cannot
reasonably be implemented within 150 calendar days after receiving the report, the Monitor may
extend the time period for implementation with prior written approval of the Department.

Follow-Up Reviews

16. A follow-up review shall commence no later than 180 calendar days after the
issuance of the initial report (unless otherwise agreed by the Company, the Monitor and the
Department). The Monitor shall issue a written follow-up report within 120 calendar days of
commencing the follow-up review, setting forth the Monitorâs assessment and, if necessary,
making recommendations in the same fashion as set forth in Paragraph 12 with respect to the

initial review. After consultation with the Company, the Monitor may extend the time period for

D-7
issuance of the follow-up report for a brief period of time with prior written approval of the
Department.

17. | Within 120 calendar days after receiving the Monitorâs follow-up report, the
Company shall adopt and implement all recommendations in the report, unless, within 30
calendar days after receiving the report, the Company notifies in writing the Monitor and the
Department concerning any recommendations that the Company considers unduly burdensome,
inconsistent with applicable law or regulation, impractical, excessively expensive, or otherwise
inadvisable. With respect to any such recommendation, the Company need not adopt that
recommendation within the 120 calendar days of receiving the report but shall propose in writing
to the Monitor and the Department an alternative policy, procedure, or system designed to
achieve the same objective or purpose. As to any recommendation on which the Company and
the Monitor do not agree, such parties shall attempt in good faith to reach an agreement within
30 calendar days after the Company serves the written notice.

18. In the event the Company and the Monitor are unable to agree on an acceptable
alternative proposal, the Company shall promptly consult with the Department. The Department
may consider the Monitorâs recommendation and the Companyâs reasons for not adopting the
recommendation in determining whether the Company has fully complied with its obligations
under the Agreement. Pending such determination, the Company shall not be required to
implement any contested recommendation(s). With respect to any recommendation that the
Monitor determines cannot reasonably be implemented within 120 calendar days after receiving
the report, the Monitor may extend the time period for implementation with prior written

approval of the Department.

D-8
19. The Monitor shall undertake a second follow-up review not later than 150
calendar days after the issuance of the first follow-up report. The Monitor shall issue a second
follow-up report within 120 days of commencing the review, and recommendations shall follow
the same procedures described in Paragraphs 16-18. No later than 60 days before the end of the
Term, the Monitor shall submit to the Department a final written report (âCertification Reportâ),
setting forth an overview of the Companyâs remediation efforts to date, including the
implementation status of the Monitorâs recommendations, and an assessment of the sustainability
of the Companyâs remediation efforts. No later than 30 days before the end of the Term, the
Monitor shall certify whether the Companyâs compliance program, including its policies and
procedures, is reasonably designed and implemented to prevent and detect violations of the anti-
corruption laws.

Monitor's Discovery of Potential or Actual Misconduct

20. = (a) Except as set forth below in sub-paragraphs (b), (c) and (d), should the

Monitor discover during the course of his or her engagement that:
e improper payments or anything else of value may have been offered,
promised, made, or authorized by any entity or person within the
Company or any entity or person working, directly or indirectly, for or on
behalf of the Company; or
Â° the Company may have maintained false books, records or accounts; or
(collectively, âPotential Misconductâ), the Monitor shall immediately report the Potential
Misconduct to the Companyâs General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer, and/or Audit

Committee for further action, unless the Potential Misconduct was already so disclosed. The

D-9
Monitor also may report Potential Misconduct to the Department at any time, and shall report
Potential Misconduct to the Department when it requests the information.

(b) In some instances, the Monitor should immediately report Potential
Misconduct directly to the Department and not to the Company. The presence of any of the
following factors militates in favor of reporting Potential Misconduct directly to the Department
and not to the Company, namely, where the Potential Misconduct: (1) poses a risk to public
health or safety or the environment; (2) involves senior management of the Company;

(3) involves obstruction of justice; or (4) otherwise poses a substantial risk of harm.

(c) If the Monitor believes that any Potential Misconduct actually occurred or
may constitute a criminal or regulatory violation (âActual Misconductâ), the Monitor shall
immediately report the Actual Misconduct to the Department. When the Monitor discovers
Actual Misconduct, the Monitor shall disclose the Actual Misconduct solely to the Department,
and, in such cases, disclosure of the Actual Misconduct to the General Counsel, Chief
Compliance Officer, and/or the Audit Committee of the Company should occur as the
Department and the Monitor deem appropriate under the circumstances.

(d) The Monitor shall address in his or her reports the appropriateness of the
Companyâs response to disclosed Potential Misconduct or Actual Misconduct, whether
previously disclosed to the Department or not. Further, if the Company or any entity or person
working directly or indirectly for or on behalf of the Company withholds information necessary
for the performance of the Monitorâs responsibilities and the Monitor believes that such

withholding is without just cause, the Monitor shall also immediately disclose that fact to the

D-10
Department and address the Companyâs failure to disclose the necessary information in his or her
reports.
(e) The Company nor anyone acting on its behalf shall take any action to
retaliate against the Monitor for any such disclosures or for any other reason.
Meetings During Pendency of Monitorship

21. | The Monitor shall meet with the Department within 30 calendar days after
providing each report to the Department to discuss the report, to be followed by a meeting
between the Department, the Monitor, and the Company.

22. At least annually, and more frequently if appropriate, representatives from the
Company and the Department will meet together to discuss the monitorship and any suggestions,
comments, or improvements the Company may wish to discuss with or propose to the
Department, including with respect to the scope or costs of the monitorship.

Contemplated Confidentiality of Monitorâs Reports

23. The reports will likely include proprietary, financial, confidential, and competitive
business information. Moreover, public disclosure of the reports could discourage cooperation,
or impede pending or potential government investigations and thus undermine the objectives of
the monitorship. For these reasons, among others, the reports and the contents thereof are
intended to remain and shall remain non-public, except as otherwise agreed to by the parties in
writing, or except to the extent that the Department determines in its sole discretion that
disclosure would be in furtherance of the Departmentâs discharge of its duties and

responsibilities or is otherwise required by law.

Odebrecht S.A. (Odebrecht), a global construction conglomerate based in Brazil, and Braskem S.A. (Braskem), a Brazilian petrochemical
company, pleaded guilty today and agreed to pay a combined total penalty of at least $3.5 billion to resolve charges with authorities in the
United States, Brazil and Switzerland arising out of their schemes to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes to government officials around
the world.

Deputy Assistant Attorney General Sung-Hee Suh of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Robert L. Capers of the Eastern
District of New York, Assistant Director Stephen Richardson of the FBIâs Criminal Investigative Division and Assistant Director in Charge William
F. Sweeney of the FBIâs New York Field Office made the announcement.

âOdebrecht and Braskem used a hidden but fully functioning Odebrecht business unitâa âDepartment of Bribery,â so to speakâthat
systematically paid hundreds of millions of dollars to corrupt government officials in countries on three continents,â said Deputy Assistant
Attorney General Suh. âSuch brazen wrongdoing calls for a strong response from law enforcement, and through a strong effort with our
colleagues in Brazil and Switzerland, we have seen just that. | hope that todayâs action will serve as a model for future efforts.â

âThese resolutions are the result of an extraordinary multinational effort to identify, investigate and prosecute a highly complex and long-lasting
corruption scheme that resulted in the payment by the defendant companies of close to a billion dollars in bribes to officials at all levels of
government in many countries,â said U.S. Attorney Capers. âIn an attempt to conceal their crimes, the defendants used the global financial
system - including the banking system in the United States - to disguise the source and disbursement of the bribe payments by passing funds
through a series of shell companies. The message sent by this prosecution is that the United States, working with its law enforcement partners
abroad, will not hesitate to hold responsible those corporations and individuals who seek to enrich themselves through the corruption of the
legitimate functions of government, no matter how sophisticated the scheme.â

âThis case illustrates the importance of our partnerships and the dedicated personnel who work to bring to justice those who are motivated by
greed and act in their own best interest,â said Assistant Director Richardson. âThe FBI will not stand by idly while corrupt individuals threaten a
fair and competitive economic system or fuel criminal enterprises. Our commitment to work alongside our foreign partners to root out
corruption across the globe is unwavering and we thank our Brazilian and Swiss partners for their tireless work in this effort.â

âNo matter what the reason, when foreign officials receive bribes, they threaten our national security and the international free market system
in which we trade,â said Assistant Director in Charge Sweeney. âJust because theyâre out of our sight, doesnât mean theyâre beyond our reach.
The FBI will use all available resources to put an end to this type of corrupt behavior.â

Odebrecht pleaded guilty to a one-count criminal information filed today by the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and the U.S. Attorneyâs Office
in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, charging the company with conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). Odebrecht agreed that the appropriate criminal fine is $4.5 billion, subject to further analysis of the
companyâs ability to pay the total global penalties. In related proceedings, Odebrecht also settled with the Ministerio Publico Federal in Brazil
and the Office of the Attorney General in Switzerland.

Under the plea agreement, the United States will credit the amount that Odebrecht pays to Brazil and Switzerland over the full term of their
respective agreements, with the United States and Switzerland receiving 10 percent each of the principal of the total criminal fine and Brazil
receiving the remaining 80 percent. The fine is subject to an inability to pay analysis to be completed by the Department of Justice and
Brazilian authorities on or before March 31, 2017, because Odebrecht has represented it is only able to pay approximately $2.6 billion over the
course of the respective agreements. Sentencing has been scheduled for April 17, 2017.

Braskem, whose American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) are publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange, separately pleaded guilty to a one-
count criminal information filed in the Eastern District of New York charging it with conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA.
Braskem agreed to pay a total criminal penalty of $632 million. Sentencing has not yet been scheduled. In related proceedings, Braskem also
settled with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Ministerio Publico Federal in Brazil and the Office of the Attorney General
in Switzerland. Under the terms of its resolution with the SEC, Braskem agreed to a total of $325 million in disgorgement of profits. Braskem
agreed to pay Brazilian authorities 70 percent of the total criminal penalty and agreed to pay the Swiss authorities 15 percent. The department
has agreed to credit the criminal penalties paid to Brazilian and Swiss authorities as part of its agreement with the company. The United States
will receive $94.8 million, an amount equal to 15 percent of the total criminal fines paid by Braskem.

Under their respective plea agreements, Odebrecht and Braskem are required to continue their cooperation with law enforcement, including in

connection with the investigations and prosecutions of individuals responsible for the criminal conduct. Odebrecht and Braskem also agreed to
adopt enhanced compliance procedures and to retain independent compliance monitors for three years. The cases are assigned to U.S. District
Judge Raymond J. Dearie of the Eastern District of New York.

The combined total amount of United States, Brazilian and Swiss criminal and regulatory penalties paid by Braskem will be approximately $957
million. The combined total amount of penalties imposed against Odebrecht will be at least $2.6 billion and up to $4.5 billion. With a combined
total of at least $3.5 billion, todayâs resolutions with Odebrecht and Braskem are the largest-ever global foreign bribery resolution.
The Bribery Schemes

According to its admissions, Odebrecht engaged in a massive and unparalleled bribery and bid-rigging scheme for more than a decade,
beginning as early as 2001. During that time, Odebrecht paid approximately $788 million in bribes to government officials, their
representatives and political parties in a number of countries in order to win business in those countries. The criminal conduct was directed by
the highest levels of the company, with the bribes paid through a complex network of shell companies, off-book transactions and off-shore bank
accounts.

As part of the scheme, Odebrecht and its co-conspirators created and funded an elaborate, secret financial structure within the company that
operated to account for and disburse bribe payments to foreign government officials and political parties. By 2006, the development and
operation of this secret financial structure had evolved such that Odebrecht established the âDivision of Structured Operations,â which
effectively functioned as a stand-alone bribe department within Odebrecht and its related entities. Until approximately 2009, the head of the
Division of Structured Operations reported to the highest levels within Odebrecht, including to obtain authorization to approve bribe payments.
After 2009, this responsibility was delegated to certain company business leaders in Brazil and the other jurisdictions. To conceal its activities,
the Division of Structured Operations utilized an entirely separate and off-book communications system, which allowed members of the Division
of Structured Operations to communicate with one another and with outside financial operators and other co-conspirators about the bribes via
secure emails and instant messages, using codenames and passwords.

The Division of Structured Operations managed the âshadowâ budget for the Odebrecht bribery operation via a separate computer system that
was used to request and process bribe payments as well as to generate and populate spreadsheets that tracked and internally accounted for
the shadow budget. These funds for the companyâs sophisticated bribery operation were generated by the Odebrecht Finance Department
through a variety of methods, as well as by certain Odebrecht subsidiaries, including Braskem. The funds were then funneled by the Division of
Structured Operations to a series of off-shore entities that were not included on Odebrechtâs balance sheet as related entities. The Division of
Structured Operations then directed the disbursement of the funds from the off-shore entities to the bribe recipient, through the use of wire
transfers through one or more of the off-shore entities, as well as through cash payments both inside and outside Brazil, which were sometimes
delivered using packages or Suitcases left at predetermined locations.

Odebrecht, its employees and agents took a number of steps while in the United States to further the scheme. For instance, in 2014 and 2015,
while located in Miami, two Odebrecht employees engaged in conduct related to certain projects in furtherance of the scheme, including
meetings with other co-conspirators to plan actions to be taken in connection with the Division of Structured Operations, the movement of
criminal proceeds and other criminal conduct. In addition, some of the off-shore entities used by the Division of Structured Operations to hold
and disburse unrecorded funds were established, owned and/or operated by individuals located in the United States. In all, this conduct
resulted in corrupt payments and/or profits totaling approximately $3.336 billion.

Braskem also admitted to engaging in a wide-ranging bribery scheme and acknowledged the pervasiveness of its conduct. Between 2006 and
2014, Braskem paid approximately $250 million into Odebrechtâs secret, off-book bribe payment system. Using the Odebrecht system,
Braskem authorized the payment of bribes to politicians and political parties in Brazil, as well as to an official at PetrÃ©dleo Brasileiro S.A. -
Petrobras (Petrobras), the state-controlled oil company of Brazil. In exchange, Braskem received various benefits, including: preferential rates
from Petrobras for the purchase of raw materials used by the company; contracts with Petrobras; and favorable legislation and government
programs that reduced the companyâs tax liabilities in Brazil. This conduct resulted in corrupt payments and/or profits totaling approximately
$465 million.

The Corporate Resolutions

The department reached these resolutions with Odebrecht and Braskem based on a number of factors, including: the failure to voluntarily
disclose the conduct that triggered the investigation; the nature and seriousness of the offense, which spanned many years, involved the
highest levels of the companies, occurred in multiple countries and involved sophisticated schemes to bribe high-level government officials; the
lack of an effective compliance and ethics program at the time of the conduct; and credit for each companyâs respective cooperation. The
companies also engaged in remedial measures, including terminating and disciplining individuals who participated in the misconduct, adopting
heightened controls and anti-corruption compliance protocols and significantly increasing the resources devoted to compliance.

The criminal penalty for Odebrecht reflects a 25 percent reduction off the bottom of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines fine range because of
Odebrechtâs full cooperation with the governmentâs investigation, while the criminal penalty for Braskem reflects a 15 percent reduction off the
bottom of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines as a result of its partial cooperation.

Odebrecht has represented its ability to pay a maximum of $2.6 billion of the total fine amount. The department and Brazilian authorities are
engaged in further analysis regarding the companyâs claimed inability to pay, which will be completed on or before March 31, 2017.

PLEA AGREEMENT

The United States Attorneyâs Office for the Southern District of Florida and the Fraud
Section of the Criminal Division of the United States Department of Justice (collectively the
âOfficesâ) and Carlos Enrique Urbano Fermin (hereinafter âthe defendantâ) enter into the
following agreement:

1. The defendant understands that he has the right to have the evidence and charges
against him presented to a federal grand jury for determination of whether or not there is probable
cause to believe he committed the offense with which he is charged. Understanding the right, and
after full and complete consultation with his counsel, the defendant agrees to waive his right to
prosecution by Indictment, agrees to waive any challenges to the statute of limitations or venue,
and agrees that the United States may proceed by way of an information filed pursuant to Rule 7
of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.

2. The defendant agrees to plead guilty to the sole count of the Information charging
the defendant with a violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 371 (Conspiracy to Commit
an Offense against the United States), specifically, conspiracy to violate 18 U.S.C. Â§ 1956(a)

(laundering of monetary instruments that are proceeds of, and done with the intent to promote,
et

Baas Naat? Nas?

specified unlawful activity, to wil, an offense against a foreign nation involving bribery of a public
official, or the misappropriation, theft, or embezzlement of public funds by or for the benefit of a
public official).

3, The defendant understands and acknowledges that, as to the sole count of the
Information, the Court may impose a statutory maximum term of imprisonment of up to 5 years
and a term of supervised release of up to 3 years. The defendant understands that the Court may
also impose a fine of up to $250,000 or twice the amount of the criminally derived property
involved in the transactions for which the defendant conspired to launder, whichever is greater.
The defendant also understands that the Court may also order forfeiture and restitution. The
defendant also understands that a special assessment in the amount of $100 will be imposed and
due at the time of sentencing.

4. The defendant is aware that the sentence will be imposed by the Court after
considering the advisory Federal Sentencing Guidelines and Policy Statements Cheremafier
âSentencing Guidelinesâ). The defendant acknowledges and understands that the Court will
compute an advisory sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines and that the applicable guidelines
will be determined by the Court relving in part on the results of a pre-sentence investigation by the
Court's probation office, which investigation will commence after the guilty plea has been entered.
The defendant is also aware that, under certain circumstances, the Court may depart from the
advisory Sentencing Guidelines range that it has computed, and may raise or lower that advisory
sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines. The defendant is further aware and understands that
the Court is required to consider the advisory guideline range determined under the Sentencing
Guidelines, but is not bound to impose a sentence within that advisory range; the Court is permitted

to tailor the ultimate sentence in light of other statutory concerns, and such sentence may be either

more severe or less severe than the advisory Sentencing Guidelines range. Knowing these facts,
the defendant understands and acknowledges that the Court has the authority to impose any
sentence within and up to the statutory maximum authorized by law for the offense identified in
paragraph 3 and that the defendant may not withdraw his guilty plea solely as a result of the
sentence unposed.

5. The Offices reserve the right to inform the Court and the probation office of all
facts pertinent to the sentencing process, including all relevant mformation concerning the offenses
committed, whether charged or not, as well as concerning the defendant and the defendant's
backeround. Subject only to the express terms of any agreed-upon recommendation, the Offices
further reserve the right to make any recommendation as to the quality and quantity of punishment.

6. The Offices agree that they will recommend at sentencing that the Court reduce by
two levels the sentencing guideline level applicable to the defendantâs offense, pursuant to Section
3E tL. l(a) of the Sentencing Guidelines, based upon the defendantâs recognition and affirmative
and timely acceptance of personal responsibility. Hf at the tume of sentencing the defendant's
offense level is determined to be 16 or greater, the government will file a motion requesting an
additional one level decrease pursuant to Section 3E1.1(b) of the Sentencing Guidelines, stating
that the defendant has assisted authorities in the investigation or prosecution of the defendant's
own misconduct by timely notifying authorities of the defendantâs intention to enter a plea of
guilty, thereby permitting the government to avoid preparing for trial and permitting the
government and the Court to allocate their resources efficiently. The Offices, however, will not
be required to make this motion and these recommendations if the defendant: (1) fails or refuses
to make a full, accurate and complete disclosure to the probation office of the circumstances

surrounding the relevant offense conduct, (2) is found to have misrepresented facts to the

government prior to entering into this plea agreement; or (3) commuls any misconduct after signing
this plea agreement, including but not limited to commutting a state or federal offense, violating
any term of release, or making false statements or misrepresentations to any governmental entity
or official,

7. The Offices agree to recommend a sentence at the low end of the applicable
advisory guideline range provided the defendant fully complies with the terms of this plea
apreement, including, but not limited to the provisions regarding forfeiture im paragraph 12.

8. The defendant is aware that the sentence has not yet been determined by the Court.
The defendant also is aware that any estimate of the probable sentencing range or sentence that the
defendant may receive, whether that estimate comes from the defendantâs attorney, the
eovernment, or the probation office, is a prediction, not a promise, and is not binding on the
government, the probation office or the Court. The defendant understands further that any
recommendation that the government makes to the Court as to sentencing, whether pursuant to this
agreement or otherwise, is not binding on the Court and the Court may disregard the
recommendation in its entirety. The defendant understands and acknowledges, as previously
acknowledged in paragraph 4 above, that the defendant may not withdraw his plea based upon the
Courtâs decision not to accept a sentencing recommendation made by the defendant, the
government, or a recommendation made jointly by both the defendant and the government.

9, This plea resolves the defendantâs federal criminal lability with regard to the
Offices for conduct related to that described in the Factual Proffer except criminal tax liability (as
to which the Offices do not have authority to make any agreement}. The defendant understands
that this agreement is binding only as to the Offices and only relating to conduct described in the

Factual Proffer.

LO. The defendant agrees that he shall cooperate fully with the Offices by: (a) providing

truthful and complete information and testimony, and producing documents, records and other
evidence, when called upon by the Offices, whether in interviews, before a grand jury, or at any
inal or other Court proceeding; (b) appearing at such grand jury proceedings, hearings, trials, and
other pudicial proceedings, and at meetings, as may be required by the Offices; and (c) if requested
by the Offices, working in an undercover role under the supervision of, and in comphance with,
law enforcement officers and agents. Any assistance the defendant may provide to the United
States federal criminal investigators shall be pursuant to the specific instructions and control of
these Offices and designated United States investigators. In addition, the defendant agrees that
he will not protect any person or entity through false information or omission, that he will not
falsely implicate any person or entity, and that he will not commut any further crimes. The
defendant agrees not to reveal his cooperation, or any information derived therefrom, to any third
party without prior consent of the Government.

Li. The defendant agrees fo provide an accounting and tracing of all monies involved
in the defendant's criminal activity and any available assets for forfeiture to the Offices upon
request, within 14 calendar days from the request. The defendant further agrees, in an individual
or any other capacity, to forfeit to the United States, voluntarily and immediately, any right, title,
and interest to any property, real or personal, which is determined to constitute or is derived from
proceeds traceable to the violation to which he is pleading guilty, pursuant to Title 18, United
States Code, Section 981(a}(1\(C), and offenses which he has disclosed to the Offices prior to
execution of this plea agreement. The property subject to forfeiture includes, but is not limited

cost, restitution, or penalty that may be unposed by the Court. The defendant knowingly and
voluntarily agrees to waive all constitutional, legal, and equitable defenses to the forfeiture,
including excessive fines under the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. In
addition, except as may be otherwise agreed, the defendant agrees to waive: any applicable time
limits for administrative or judicial forfeiture proceedings, the requirements of Fed. R. Crim. P.
32.2 and 43(a}, as they relate to forfeiture, and any appeal of the forfeiture.

12. The defendant also agrees to fully and truthfully disclose the existence, nature and
location of all assets in which the defendant has or had any direct or indirect financial interest or
control, and any assets involved in the offense of conviction. The defendant agrees to take all
steps requested by the Untted States for the recovery and forfeiture of all assets which are subject
to forferture. This includes, but is not limited to, the timely delivery upon request of all necessary
and appropriate documentation to deliver good and marketable title, consenting to all orders of
forfeiture, and not impeding in any way any criminal, civil or administrative forfetture proceeding
concerning the forfeiture.

13. in furtherance of the satisfaction of a forfeiture money judgment entered by the
Court in this case, the defendant agrees to the following:

a. Maintain any asset valued in excess of $10,000, and not sell, hide, waste,
encumber, destroy, or otherwise devalue such asset without prior approval of
the United States;

b. provide information about any transfer of an asset valued in excess of $10,000

since the commencement of the offense conduct in this case to date:
et

Baas Naat? Nas?

c. cooperate fully in the investigation and the identification of assets, including
liquidating assets, meeting with representatives of the United States, and
providing any documentation requested; and

d. notify, within 30 days, the Clerk of the Court for the Southern District of
Florida and the Offices of: G) any change of name, residence, or mailing
address, and (it) any material change in economic circumstances.

The defendant further understands that providing false or incomplete information about assets,
concealing assets, making materially false statements or representations, or making or using false
writings or documents pertaining to assets, taking any action that would impede the forfeiture of
assets, or failing to cooperate fully in the investigation and identification of assets may be used as
a basis for: (4) separate prosecution, including, under 18 U.S.C. Â§ 1001; or Gd recommendation of
a denial of a reduction for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to the United States Sentencing
Guidelines Â§ 3ELT.

[4. The Offices reserve the right to evaluate the nature and extent of the defendant's
cooperation and to make that cooperation, or lack thereof, known to the Court at the time of
sentencing. If, in the sole and unreviewable judgment of the Offices, the defendantâs
cooperation is of such quality and significance to the investigation or prosecution of other criminal
matters as to warrant the Courtâs downward departure from the advisory sentencing range
calculated under the Sentencing Guidelines and/or any applicable mmimum mandatory sentence,
the Offices may make a motion prior to sentencing pursuant to Section 5K.1.1 of the Sentencing
Guidelines and/or Title 18, United States Code, Section 3553(e}, or subsequent to sentencing
pursuant to Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, informing the Court that the

defendant has provided substantial assistance and recommending that the defendantâs sentence be

reduced. The defendant understands and agrees, however, that nothing in this agreement requires
the Offices to file any such motions, and that the Officesâ assessment of the quality and
significance of the defendantâs cooperation shall be binding as it relates to the appropriateness of
the Officesâ filing or non-filing of a motion to reduce sentence.

ES. The defendant understands and acknowledges that the Court is under no obligation
to grant a motion for reduction of sentence filed by the government. In addition, the defendant
further understands and acknowledges that the Court is under no obligation of any type to reduce
the defendant's sentence because of the defendantâs cooperation.

16. The defendant is aware that Title 18, United States Code, Section 3742 and Title
28, United States Code, Section 1291 afford the defendant the right to appeal the sentence imposed
in this case. Acknowledging this, in exchange for the undertakings made by the Offices in this
plea agreement, the defendant hereby watves all rights conferred by Sections 3742 and [291 to
appeal any sentence imposed, inchiding any restitution order, or to appeal the manmer in which the
sentence was imposed, unless the sentence exceeds the maximum permitted by statute or is the
result of an upward departure and/or an upward variance from the advisory guideline range that
the Court establishes at sentencing.

L7. The defendant further understands that nothing in this agreement shall affect the
government's right and/or duty to appeal as set forth m Title 18, United States Code, Section
3742(b) and Title 28, United States Code, Section 1291. However, if the United States appeals
the defendantâs sentence pursuant to Sections 3742(6) and 1291, the defendant shail be released
from the above watver of appellate rights. In addition to the foregoing provisions, the defendant
hereby waives all rights to argue on appeal that the statute to which the defendant is pleading guilty

is unconstitutional and that the admitted conduct does not fall within the scope of the statute. By

signing this agreement, the defendant acknowledges that the defendant has discussed the appeal
waiver set forth in this agreement with the defendantâs attorney.

18. The defendant recognizes that pleading guilty may have consequences with respect
to the defendantâs ummigration status ifthe defendant is not a citizen of the United States or if the
defendant is a naturalized citizen of the United States. Under federal law, a broad range of crimes
are removable offenses, including the offense to which the defendant is pleading guilty. Indeed,
because the defendant is pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering, removal is
presumptively mandatory. Removal and other immugration consequences are the subject of a
separate proceeding, however, and the defendant understands that no one, including the
defendantâs attorney or the Court, can predict to a certainty the effect of the defendantâs conviction
on the defendantâs immigration status. The defendant nevertheless affirms that the defendant
wants to plead guilty regardless of any immigration consequences that the defendant's plea may
ental, even if the consequence is the defendantâs automatic removal from the United States.

19. if, in the sole and unreviewable discretion of the Offices, the Offices determine that
the defendantâs presence is essential to the success of a federal investigation or prosecution and
that the defendant has otherwise complied with the terms of this agreement, the Offices may
recommend that the defendant be issued an Â§ Visa classification. It is understood that the Offices
have authority only to recommend an S visa, and that the final decision whether to seek such relief
rests with the law enforcement agency (LEAâ) submitting the application requesting an S visa for
the defendant. The decision whether to submit such an application for consideration by the
Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security will be in the sole discretion of
the LEA, and may be submitted only ifthe LEA and the Offices determine that the defendant

otherwise qualifies under 18 U.S.C. Â§ 10i(@CiS\S) and 8 CPLR. 214.2), inchiding if the

defendantâs deportation would pose a significant threat to the defendantâs safety. There is no
guarantee that if an S visa application is submutted in the future for the defendant that he will be
granted S nonimmigrant status, even if he may be statutorily eligible. The defendant understands
and agrees, however, that nothing im this agreement requires the Offices to make any such
recommendation, and thatthe Officesâ assessment of the quality and significance of the
defendantâs cooperation shall be binding as it relates to the appropriateness of the Officesâ
recommendation.

20. The Offices and the defendant stipulate to and agree not to contest the facts in the
Factual Proffer, and stipulate that such facts, in accordance with Rule 11(b)(3) of the Federal Rules
of Criminal Procedure, provide a sufficient factual basis for the plea of guilty in this case. The
defendant agrees that the facts in the Factual Proffer are true and correct to the best of the
defendantâs knowledge. Because the factual basis set forth in the Factual Proffer has the limited
purpose of supporting the defendantâs guilty plea to the charge discussed im paragraph two, the
factual basis set forth im the Factual Proffer does not purport to represent all facts and
circumstances relating to the defendantâs participation. Sumnuarly, the factual basis in the Factual
Proffer is not mtended to identify all knowledge the defendant might have of the unlawful activity
of other individuals.

21. in the event the defendant withdraws from this agreement prior to or after pleading
guilty to the charge identified in paragraph two above: should the court refuse to accept the
defendantâs guilty plea; or should the Offices, in their sole discretion, determine that the defendant
has failed to fully comply with any of the terms of this plea agreement, the Offices will be released
from their obligations under this agreement, and the defendant agrees and understands that, in that

PROBABLECAUSE Â© |

16. In 2016, a Confidential Source (CS) approached the HSI Miami Office (HSI-
Miami) regarding 78 million in Euros the CS received, which originated from a loan contract with
PDVSA. The CS was involved in a money laundeting conspiracy and wanted to surrender the
money and cooperate. HSI-Miami thereafter began an undercover investigation: Organized Crime
and Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF) Operation Money Flight.

17. TheCs agreed to, wear a recording device and Operation Money Flight proceeded
proactively with an initial focus on the defendantsâ efforts to launder a portion of the 78 million in
Euros (the âPDVSA firhdsâ) in and through South Florida.

18. âTwo years and over one hundred recordings later, Operation Money Flight revealed
an international conspiracy to launder the PDVSA funds through Miami and several large-scale,
international third-party money-laundering organizations. More specifically, the investigation

revealed the use of Miami real estate and sophisticated false-investment schemes to: launder

hundreds of millions of U.S. Dollars.
Case TTe-cm20085-KMW BDocurrent3 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/24/2018 Page 6 of 35

Venezuelan Corruption & Miami Laundering
19. Venezuela has a foreign-currency exchange system under which the government
âwill exchange local currency (Bolivars) at a fixed rate for U.S. Dollars. The fixed exchange rate
has been well below the true economic rate by a substantial factor for several years. For example,
in 2014, the Venezuelan government fixed exchange rate was approximately six Bolivars to one
U.S. Dollar. By contrast, the true economic exchange rate was approximately sixty Bolivars to one
U.S. Dollar. Y

20. The difference betweenâ the fixed rate and the true economic rate creates
opportunity for fraud and abuse. c

21. For example, in 2014, an individual could exchange 10 million U.S. Dollars
for 600 million Bolivars at the true economic rate. Then, if that individual had access to the
government fixed rate, he could convert that sameâ600 million Bolivars into 100 million U.S.
Dollars. Essentially, in two transactions, thatâperson could buy 100 million U.S. Dollars for 10
million U.S. Dollars. â

22. Massive fraud and corruption is rampant throughout Venezuelaâs government-run
foreign-exchange system. Estimates of the fraud range as high as $20 billion a year, and reports
indicate that corrupt government officials take kickbacks to authorize exchanges at the fixed
rate. Z

23. Embezzlement of Venezuelaâs dwindling foreign currency reserves is the fuel for

these corrupt exchange schemes. PDVSA is Venezuelaâs primary source of income and foreign

currency (namely, U.S. Dollars and Euros), and serves as the source of foreign currency used to

Case i T8-cr20055-KMW Document 3 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/24/2018 Page 7 of 33 |

fund corrupt foreign exchange embezzlement schemes. As with Venezuela in general, fraud and
corruption is reportedly common at PDVSA.

24. Venezuelaâs state of social, political, and economic crisis in which multi-billion-
Dollar corrupt and criminal ecosystems thrive drives rivers of criminal proceeds through South
Florida, which has become an international money-laundering hub and a desirable destination for
well-to-do foreign criminals and kleptocrats.

False-Investment Money Laundering van

25. Most of the defendants are sophisticated operators with respect to the international
banking system and are aware of banksâ general due diligence and anti-money laundering
practices, including know-your-customer (K YC) requirements: .

26. Importantly, for one party to wire funds to a third party, there must be some
legitimate business justification provided to the bank: for instance, a payment for the purchase of
real estate or equipment. Moreover, a bank will ask for documents supporting the justification,
whichâdepending on the transactionâCan be difficult to manufacture; for instance, a bank may
be able to verify whether a supposed real estate transaction took place. This verification poses a
problem for money laundering transactions in which large sums of criminal proceeds must be
moved around the finaficial system from one person to another as bribes, kickbacks, transfers, or
exorbitant expenditures, for instance.

27. Accordingly, false investments in fake securities are convenient justifications in
that they are more difficult for a bank to investigate and verify. By way of example, one party
might wire 30 million U.S. Dollars to a third party with the justification that the amount is a loan

to the third party, supported by a 30 million U.S. Dollar promissory note due at some point in the

future, which neither party actually intends to honor. For the bank, ascertaining the true intent of
the parties and the fraudulent nature of the investment is difficult.

28. Sophisticated false-investment money laundering schemes are used throughout this
conspiracy, ranging from individual false securities (promissory notes and bonds) to entire false-
investment funds, which can be subscribed to as needed to justify transactions.

29. Surrounding and supporting these false-investment laundering schemes are
complicit money managers, brokerage firms, banks, and real estate investment firms in the United
States and elsewhere, operating as a network of professional money launderers.

Money Laundering Conspiracy .

30. The conspiracy in this case began in December 2014 with a currency exchange
scheme to embezzle approximately 600 million US. Dollars from PDVSA, obtained through
bribery and fraud, and the defendantsâ efforts to use the CS to launder a portion of the proceeds of
that scheme (the PDVSA funds). By May of*2015, the conspiracy had doubled in amount to 1.2
billion U.S. Dollars embezzled from PDVSA.

31. The facts of the âconspiracy set forth below are evidenced by electronic
communications and docunients, government records, financial records, recordings of phone
conversations and in-pÃ©rson meetings, and CS statements.

4 CONVIT & URDANETA Approach the CS

32. In 2014, URDANETA and CONVIT approached the CS with an offer to sell 100

million U.S. Dollars at a favorable Bolivar exchange rate and without the CS having to front the

Bolivars.
Case iTe-cr20085-KMW DBooumentS Entered on FLSD Docket 07/24/2018 Page 9 af 3s

33. | The CS agreed because the CS had clients in Venezuela to whom the CS could sell
the U.S. Dollars. From previous business dealings, the CS knew CONVIT obtained U.S. Dollars
from exchange contracts with PDVSA. |

34. |The CS expected to receive a simple buyer-seller foreign exchange (âforexâ)
contract to memorialize the agreement with CONVIT and URDANETA.

35. Over the course of the next month, January 2015, CONVIT, URDANETA, and the
CS continued to discuss and facilitate the supposed forex transaction, often via BlackBerry
Messenger (BBM) chats and while CONVIT was present in the Southern District of Florida,
according to U.S. travel and other records.â <

36. During this time, CONVIT delayed providing the forex contract to the CS, but this' ~
did not overly concern the CS because the funds were coming from a regulated asset management
firm, âEuropean Financial Institution 1,â which the Ã©s could explain to the receiving bank.

37. | The CS instructed CONVIT toâwire the funds from European Financial Institution
1 to an account belonging to a trust, of which the CS was the ultimate beneficiary. CONVIT agreed
and informed the CS that the funds âwould arrive in Euros and not U.S. Dollars.

38. By February, 12, 2015, the CS had received approximately 78.8 million Euros into
the trust from Europeari Financial Institution 1 in four separate wire transfers beginning on January
14, 2015. 4

39. After receiving the initial 36 million Euros in mid-January, the CS asked CONVIT

via BBM chat on January 13, 2015 if the CS could sell about 20 million Euros to a client, but

CONVIT replied âno.â CONVIT explained that he had already paid for the Bolivars on his end

 

* According to these records, CONVIT arrived in the Southern âDistrict of Florida on December
20, 2014 and departed on January 18, 2015.
Case [:bS-cr-20685-KMW Document friterecd on FLSD Docket 7/24/2018 Page LO of 33

(meaning he had no immediate need for Bolivars), and that the CS would have to wait about a
month to sell the Euros further.

40. On February 6, 2015, the CS informed CONVIT that the CS urgently needed the
forex contract between the CS and European Financial Institution 1 for the CSâs bankâs compliance
department. The CS asked CONVIT for a form draft so that the CS could prepare it.

41. That same day, CONVIT finally sent the CS a (PDF) document to justify the
transfer between European Financial Institution 1 and the CSâs trust. What CONVIT sent,
however, was a false joint venture contract between a Hong Kong shell company, Eaton Global
Services Limited, and the CSâs trust, with a forged signature on behalf of the CSâs trustee. The CS
had never seen this contract before.

42. The fake joint venture contract, dated December 17, 2014, contemplated a fictitious ;
600 million U.S. Dollar joint venture between Eaton Global and the CSâs trust; the supposed
business of the joint venture was the making of loans to PDVSA:

43, On February 9, 2015, the CS told CONVIT that the fake joint venture contract could
not be used. CONVIT and URDANETA assured the CS that the fake contract had not been used

)
or provided to any bank.

y

44. The CSâalso requested the original underlying exchange contracts and CONVIT
responded that URDANETA had physical copies and would deliver them. Days later in Venezuela,
the CS received the documents in-person from URDANETA, who explained that he obtained the
documents from âCONSPIRATOR 1,â a former PDVSA official.

45. These documents, which the CS provided to HSI-Miami, reveal the source of the

PDVSA funds and the nature of the scheme.
Case [:ES-cr-20685-KMW Document friterecd on FLSD Docket O7/24/2018 Page Li of 33

PDVSA Bribery & Embezzlement Scheme Revealed
46. Thesource of the PDVSA funds was a PDVSA foreign-currency exchange scheme
benefitting Eaton Global. The exchange scheme was disguised as a âfinancingâ arrangement using
the following three documents (provided by URDANETA) in an artless attempt to hide what was
ultimately revealed as an embezzlement:
a. First, a loan contract, dated December 17, 2014, between PDVSA
. and Rantor Capital C.A., a Venezuelan shell company, in which Rantorâagreed to
loan 7.2 billion Bolivars to PDVSA. The loan contract was executed by
âVENEZUELAN OFFICIAL 1â as Vice President of PDVSA;
b. Second, an assignment contract, dated December 23, 2014, between
Rantor and Eaton Global, in which Rantor assigns its rights as PDVSAâs creditor
under the loan contract to Eaton Global and in which it is contemplated that PDVSA
is given the right to cancel the debt within 180 days by paying 600 million U.S.
Dollars; and <
C. Third, a notice of assignment letter, dated December 23, 2014, in
which Eaton Global informs PDVSA (VENEZUELAN OFFICIAL 1) of the
assignment andâ suggests that PDVSA repay the 7.2 billion Bolivar loan in the Euro
equivalent of 600 million U.S. Dollars. The letter included instructions for PDVSA
to wire the funds to European Financial Institution 1 accounts for the benefit of
Eaton Global. |
47. In short, Eaton Global ended up with the right to pay PDVSA about 7.2 billion
Bolivars (worth around 35 million Euros) and receive about 510 million Euros, of which about

78.8 million Euros was sent to the CS.
Case iis-cr-20685-KMW Document Entered on FLSO Docket 07/24/2018 Page 12 of 33

48. While the CS continued to wait for a forex contract from CONVIT and
URDANETA, the CS began to conduct third-party transactions on their and CONSPIRATOR 1âs
behalf. Ultimately, the CS learned that the CS was not involved in a forex transaction, but rather a
money laundering operation in which the CS was expected to launder the proceeds of the
embezzlement and make cash kickback payments to VENEZUELAN OFFICIAL 1.

49. In April 2015, the CS began making cash payments in Venezuela at URDANETA
and CONSPIRATOR 1âs direction, including to URDANETA, CONSPIRATOR 1, and
VENEZUELAN OFFICIAL 1, which would ultimately total over 1 million U.S. Dollars.

50. In all, the CS conducted approximately 15 million Euros-worth of transactions
through the summer of 2015, including several U.S.-Dollar wire transactions at the defendantsâ
direction,â until the CS began to resist making further payments. Around that time, the CS used
the liquidation of the CSâs trustee as an excuse to halt payments: the CS claimed that the CS could
not continue without the forex contract. CONVIT and URDANETA continued to pressure the CS.
The ensuing impasse led to a meeting around November 2015 at CONVITâs office in Venezuela,

51. Around November 5015 , CONVIT summoned the CS to a meeting at CONVITâs
office in Caracas, Venezuela. Prior to the meeting, CONVIT explained to the CS that the CS would
meet AMPARAN, who was in charge of the financial documents.

52. At the meeting, CONVIT, URDANETA, AMPARAN, and the CS sat around a
table. CONVIT had a handgun on the table. Next to CONVIT was a German Shepard with a shock

collar. CONVIT held the remote for the collar, and commented that he could not always control

the dog. The meeting took place at CONVITâs office with numerous security guards; according to
the CS, the mood was one of intimidation by CONVIT.

53. | AMPARAN told the CS that the fake joint venture contract -had in fact been
provided to European Financial Institution 1âs banks in Canada and Malta. Accordingly,
AMPARAN explained that it would be impossible to replace the contract with a simple forex
contract and additional fake contracts were needed. The CS asked to return the PDVSA funds and
reverse the transactions, but was told a reversal was impossible. L

The CS Records the Defendants

54. Beginning in February 2016, the CS recorded conveisations with the defendants
and other conspirators in which they explicitly acknowledgedâ the money laundering conspiracy
and underlying embezzlement. As evidence by the following recordings, during this time, the cs
worked with URDANETA, ORTEGA, and CONSPIRATOR 1 to account for and distribute the
PDVSA funds to themselves and others andâto ensure that AMPARAN supplied the additional
fake contracts necessary to do so. |
55. In a-February 19, 2016 recorded meet with URDANETA, the CS complained that
the CS needed additional documents from AMPARAN. URDANETA agreed and said that he
would write to AMPARAN, CONVIT and âCONSPIRATOR 2â to âbug themâ about the
contracts. URDANETA also stated that they (CONVIT, et al.) are being âhit right nowâ by people
in the âassemblyâ and joked that it is not a âpifiata,â in an apparent reference to corrupt Venezuelan
officials hitting the defendants up for bribes. URDANETA also stated that he would not go to the

United States because the last time he was searched at the border and âthey took away [his] phone.

[And t]hank God [he] didnât have [his] phone, but a new phone.â

11
Case iiS-cr-20685-KMW Document 3S Entereci on FLSO Docket O7/24/2018 Page 14 of 83

56. In a February 22, 2016 recorded meet with ORTEGA, ORTEGA and the CS
discussed how to move ORTEGAâs money from the CS to ORTEGA. The CS explained that it is
not simple, and ORTEGA, regarding the source of his portion of the PDVSA funds, stated:

So we can be frank and open with each other. Now. You know the origin of that.

And that comes from... from something that is still making noise and itâs still

making noise and itâs still making noise. Itâs going to explode one day. [ mean,

maybe not tomorrow, and also, itâs not the... our friend, the leader in all this, he is
everywhere every day

ORTEGA also acknowledged CONSPIRATOR 1âs"" role in assigning him a portion of the PDVSA
funds and fretted aloud:

Itâs all that shit theyâve been talking about, investigatioris and shit. Or the
Americans going into all this, is that tue? How far does that reach?

But, how far could they get, in your opinion? If they get to the Swiss and they tell
them, âI want, I want this information.â Do they have to give it to them?

Finally, the CS and ORTEGA walked through somÃ© account opening forms and discussed how
ORTEGA could avoid declaring himself as a politically exposed person (also known as a PEP) on
bank KYC documents. a

57. In a February 23; 2016 recorded conversation with âCONSPIRATOR 3â
(CONSPIRATOR 1âs brother the CS explained that the CSâs trustee is liquidating and
âeventually thereâs a risk of the trustee checking the operationâ and finding that the âthe guys did
a fake deal, falsifying the signatures of these guys who are there.â The CS explained that the CS â
called URDANETA and CONSPIRATOR | and told them that they have to set the documentation
straight. The CS and CONSPIRATOR 3 also discussed a meeting in Caracas between the CS,
URDANETA, and AMPARAN about fixing the document, and CONSPIRATOR 3 noted that he

has a âpayment for [VENEZUELAN OFFICIAL 1].â

 

4 CONSPIRATOR 1 is a former PDVSA official.

58. In a March 7, 2016 recorded meet with URDANETA, the CS and URDANETA
recounted the receipt and expenditure of the PDVSA funds to date (âseventy eight million eight
hundred and somethingâ). They recounted how much belonged to CONSPIRATOR 1 (âfourteen
million five hundred forty thousand six hundred twenty-fiveâ) and other expenditures, including a
list of cash payments to include payments to VENEZUELAN OFFICIAL 1 who authorized the
underlying PDVSA loan agreement. The CS recounted the cash kickbacks to VENEZUELAN
OFFICIAL 1 as follows: | 7 |

[VENEZUELAN OFFICIAL 1], I gave him... to the boy he sent-in one occasion

two hundred thousand [200,000], June fourth [4'*] and in another occasion one

URDANETA agreed. URDANETA and the CS then discussed AMPARANâs plan to make new

| fake contracts justifying the transaction (the CS noted to URDANETA that AMPARAN is flying
to Miami in several days). URDANETA was conÃ©Ã©med that he didnât want to leave a trail of
âbreadcrumbsâ with respect to the accounts. URDANETA again acknowledged CONVITâs
involvement and CONSPIRATOR 1âs arrangement with ORTEGA. CONSPIRATOR 1 joined the
meeting and discussed with URDANETA and the CS the fake joint venture contract, who was
responsible for it, and how âto divide up the PDVSA funds.

59. Importantly, at this meeting, URDANETA and CONSPIRATOR 1 reviewed a
spreadsheet of all the cash payments and expenditures created by the CS; each acknowledged the
contents of the document, wrote notes on it, checked off transactions, and, ultimately, dated it. The
CS provided a copy of this document to HSI-Miami with both URDANETA and CONSPIRATOR
1âs handwritten notes ; included on the spreadsheet are the kickback payments to VENEZUELAN
OFFICIAL 1. |

60. In a March 9, 20 16 recorded meet with AMPARAN and URDANETA,

AMPARAN ran through the plan to replace the fake joint venture agreement with new documents.

s

13

AMPARAN explained that the fake agreement could be replaced with the new (better) fake ones
in the compliance file at the Canadian bank and added to the file at European Financial Institution
1, and further that the âAccounting Firm 1â auditors are on board. AMPARAN explained that he
is flying to Miami the next day and from there he will print out and provide the CS with the new
fake contracts.

61. In a March 15, 2016 recorded meet with ORTEGA, ORTEGA explained to the CS
that he has found a âpersonâ (GUSTAVO) with a âstructureâ to transfer his PDVSA funds to
ORTEGA, and asks the CS to meet with the person in New York, Miami; or Panama. ORTEGA
asked the CS what the CSâs story is and why the CS is acting differently âovernightâ and whether
it is âan investigationâ; the CS explained that everyone is âmaking messes,â that the CS has
âstart[ed] to find out about stuff... the [CS] didnâ t know,â and that the CSi 1S stopping because the
CS doesnât want to get into trouble. ORTEGA explaiced that the rumor is that the âAmericans are
investigating you, that you are in big troubleâ and asked the CS whether the CS is under
investigation and what the banks have asked the CS.

62. In an April 2, 2016 recorded meet with ORTEGA and GUSTAVO in Panama,
ORTEGA introduced the CS to GUSTAVO, who explained how he can launder money using his
brokerage firm and private mutual fund. Specifically, GUSTAVO explained that his brokerage
firm, GSA, operates from the United States, but primarily does business in Latin America and
manages $2 billion.* Regarding GSAâs reputation, GUSTAVO explained:

I would say that our profile, would be by-by nature a business that we prioritized

the type of client with which we deal, uh...letâs say if it is a low profile, we go even
, D

 

> I am further aware, that GSA is affiliated with Global Strategic Investments, LLC (GSI), which
is a broker/dealer headquartered in Miami, Florida. GUSTAVO and the CS would later conduct
numerous meetings at GSIâs office in Miami.

14
 

lower, that way they will never talk about us, or any advertising, or any cocktail
parties.

GUSTAVO explained that they operate a fake mutual fund which receives money from a payment
made to look like an investment into the fund, but is actually laundered out of the fund. GUSTAVO
explained that âweâll make the transactions in such a way that the purchase will look legitimateâ
and that the money can be directed anywhere on the back-end using âcardsâ or âchecksâ or even
âwire transfers,â but as to the latter he (GUSTAVO) will âalways be on the lookout to see the
transfer and whoâs receiving it, because...[l]ike the saying goes, the fish dies by its mouth. ...they
have their eyes on everyone.â GUSTAVO went on to explain how he ean avoid being tracked by
the authorities such as Interpol and acknowledged that ORTEGA and the CSâs situation is a âtime
bomb.â Finally, GUSTAVO insisted that they use WhatsApp to communicate and avoid emails.Â®
Cooperation Begins & Conspiracy Continues in Miami

63. In April 2016, the CS began cooperating with HSI-Miami and continued making
consensual recordings with the defendants and other conspirators.

64. The conspiracy continued in four primary aspects. First, AMPARAN worked to
replace the fake joint venture contact with better fake contracts to justify the initial transfers to the
CS. Second, AMPARAN worked to launder URDANETAâs portion of the PDVSA funds. from
the CS using false investments. Third, GUSTAVO worked to launder ORTEGAâs portion of the
PDVSA funds fom the CS, also using false investments. And fourth, KRULL and GUSTAVO

worked to launder additional PDVSA funds that did not originally flow through the CS.

 

6 Based on my training and experience, encrypted peer-to-peer chat services, such as WhatsApp,
are preferred by individuals engaged in criminal activity because law enforcement is generally
unable to obtain the content of the communications from the service provider.

15
Case 1: bS-cr-20685-K MW Document 3S friterecd on FLSD Docket O7/24/2018 Page 18 of 33

65. During the course of this conspiracy, GUSTAVO also laundered funds as part of a
scheme to promote international narcotics trafficking. KRULL also contacted the CS with several
separate plans to launder money from at least one foreign bribery scheme, all as set forth below.

AMPARANâs Replacement of the Fake Joint Venture Contract

66. Ina recorded April 27, 2016 meet with AMPARAN at the Miami, Florida office of
Solar Cargo, Inc.,7 AMPARAN and the CS discussed the fake joint venture contract and
AMPARAN acknowledged that it was meant to justify the movement of the PDVSA funds to the
cs and that CONVIT was involved. AMPARAN assured the CS not toâworry about European
Financial Institution 1 and the fake contract because European FinanÃ©ial Institution 1 will let him
know if there is an investigation and AMPARAN âcan manipulate that.â AMPARAN and the CS
discussed supplemental fake contracts AMPARAN had previously prepared and provided.
AMPARAN also began to explain how he will lander URDANETAâs portion of the PDVSA
funds using fake bonds. â

67. On or around May 26,: 5016, the CS received a BBM chat from AMPARAN
instructing him where in Venezuela to pick up the proposed fake contracts. The CS had an assistant
pick up the replacement fake contracts from AMPARAN and provided them to HSI-Miami.

68. On May 25, 2016, URDANETA sent a BBM chat to the CS stating that
âT*âCONSPIRATOR 4%] ... has an offer and I prefer you to speak directly with him.â On May 27,

2016, the CS had a recorded call with CONSPIRATOR 4, and explained to CONSPIRATOR 4

that the CS was working with AMPARAN to fix things and that the CS had explained to the bank '

 

7 AMPARAN explained in the recorded meet that he works for Solar Cargo, that it has six planes
operating, and that he had recently been hired by PDVSA to move medicine from Iran to
Venezuela.

8 CONSPIRATOR 4 is associated with CONVIT and formerly with PDVSA .

16
Case [:bS-cr-20685-K MW Document frierecd on FLSD Docket 7/24/2018 Page 19 of 33

that the PDVSA funds were from an exchange transaction. CONSPIRATOR 4 responded âOh they
made it upâ and the following conversation ensued: |

CONSPIRATOR 4: This is bad. This is bad when not-not-not... The truth is not
L spoken and canât-canât-canât even do [unintelligible]
regarding it since it never happened.

CS: Uh-huh. But...the truth was a foreign exchange transaction,
correct?

CONSPIRATOR 4: The truth it was, was, was not a foreign exchange.
transaction. It does not exist in Bolivars. Not atall, it was
a payment [unintelligible]

CONSPIRATOR 4 suggested a meeting in Venezuela with everyone who has âan interestâ to sort
things out and fix âthe papersâ before things get bad when it is too-late.

69. On June 13, 2016, the CS met with AMPARAN in Venezuela and they executed
replacement fake contracts. The replacement fake contracts (later provided to HSI-Miami by the
CS) included a complex array of bogus financing and trust documents involving Rantor, the CSâs""
trust, and other entities.

70. On June 22, 2016, AMPARAN sent the CS an email with a fake loan agreement
between Solar Cargo and Rantot meant to supplement the replacement fake contracts. In BBM
chats between AMPARAN and the CS in August 2016, AMPARAN asked if the CS received the
latest contract, and the CS responded yes. On September 5, 2016, AMPARAN sent the final fake
contract between Solar Cargo and a company belonging to the CS. All of these replacement fake
contracts were backdated to early 2014.

AMPARAN and URDANETAâs Efforts to Continue Laundering PDVSA Funds

71. As mentioned above, in an April 27, 2016 recorded meet with AMPARAN in

Miami, the efforts to launder URDANETAâs portion of the PDVSA funds from the CS occurred

_ simultaneously to AMPARANâs efforts to replace or supplement the fake joint venture contract.

17
Case [:bS-cr-20685-KMW Document frierecd on FLSD Docket 7/24/2018 Page 20 of 33

During that meet, AMPARAN explained how he would launder URDANETAâs portion of the
PDVSA funds using the purchase of a fraudulent bond designed to default to conceal the transfer:

we are now working through a mechanism, through which, we issue a bond through
a bank, from which we have, eh, on which we have a lot of influence, or several
banks, but one in particular that is the one, we are working with right now, we issue
a bond. ... That you on that side would buy, you would make an investment in that
bond, we receive, um, that, eh, receive that money for the purchase of that bond
and you keep the bond on that side. In the term of, a number of months, that bond
starts going down in price, ... until there comes a moment when it flips, ... but the
account is never closed, nor, nor are funds transferred, the funds never leave, and
an investment is made. â4

72. In a May 12, 2016 recorded call with URDANETA, URDANETA and the CS
recounted the CSâs meeting with AMPARAN and the- defaulting-bond laundering plan.
URDANETA brought up an apartment âover thereâ in Miami for which he paid a significant

deposit that he is being pressured to close on in 60 days by the developer and agreed to send the

a
Lf

CS the notice from the developer.

2, URDANETA later sent the @S an image of a May 10, 2016 email from the
developer of the Porsche Design Tower in Miami, informing him of the upcoming closing on the
unit. The email included âPre Closing Questionnaireâ provided by the developer contains the
following warning: âNote: taking title under a company or trust may trigger FinCEN reporting
requirements.â In a follow up chat with the CS, URDANETA explained that he was worried about
the FinCEN reporting requirement and discussed ways to minimize the risk; URDANETA
suggested forming a new company with his wife as the beneficial owner.

74. In a May 17, 2016 recorded call with URDANETA, URDANETA discussed the

transfer of the Miami condominium with the equity of URDANETAâs down payment to

AMPARAN as a fee for AMPARANâs laundering services. And, ina May 18, 2016 recorded meet

18
Case [:ES-cr-20685-KMW Document friterecd on FLSD Docket O7/24/2018 Page 21 of 33

with AMPARAN at Solar Cargo in Miami, AMPARAN and the CS discussed using the Miami
condominium as a feeâ and moving forward with the defaulting-bond laundering plan. :

75. In a November 21, 2016 BBM chat, AMPARAN provided the details of an
additional fraudulent bond purchase to launder URDANETAâs PDVSA funds and explained that
the bond purchase will be facilitated through a U.K. broker dealer, âEuropean Financial Institution
2.â

76. In a March 1, 2017 recorded meet, the CS met with URDANETA, AMPARAN,
âCONSPIRATOR 5,â!â and GOIS, at the offices of European Company 1-in Madrid, Spain. Prior
to the meeting, URDANETA was captured on the recording explaining âto the CS that the CS:
should not be concerned about the fake joint venture contract-or being caught because they only
had to worry about the United States and the âAmericans ... have no jurisdictionâ; URDANETA
uses the word âlaunderâ to describe their activities. â

77. The purpose of the meeting was for the CS to gain comfort with the âoperationâ
proposed by AMPARAN. CONSPIRATOR 5 and GOIS were introduced as the managers of the
operation and meant to comfort the CS, who had relayed misgivings to URDANETA about
working with AMPARAN,, .

78. During'the meeting, GOIS asked if there is anything he can tell the CS to make him

more comfortable and the CS noted that he was concerned about European Financial Institution 2

â

 

Â°AMPARAN and URDANETA would later report that they worked out a solution to achieve the
transfer. Miami-Dade Property records show that the property was transferred from the developer
to Paladium Real Estate Group LLC on January 12, 2017. According to the Florida Department of
State, Paladium was formed on May 26, 2016 with URDANETAâs wife as an owner. On
September 23, 2016, AMPARANâs wife was added as a manager of Paladium, and on September
15, 2017, after the closing, URDANETAâs wife was removed, leaving AMPARAN in control of Â©
Paladium and the condominium.

Case (:ES-cr-20685-KMW Document frierec on FLSD Docket O7/24/2018 Page 22 of 33

because they asked âno questionâ and had âno objectionâ when an account was opened in the CSâs
name to purchase the fake bond. GOIS explained that there is no issue with European Financial
Institution 2, AMPARAN, GOIS, and CONSPIRATOR 5 went on to explain that they manage a
fund which allows them'foâ* generate payment structures, and third party payments institution, with
a very light KYC.ââ AMPARAN emphasized that they can make payments to âMiami, Panama,
Europeâ: the CS clarified, âAnd you have no issues paying in the United States?â, to which
AMPARAN replied, âNo.â GOIS explained that the CS should first buy a U.K. GILT, then
transfer it to an account in the CSâs name at European Financial Institution 2, after which it will
be swapped with the fake bond to begin the transfer to URDANETA.â |
~79. On April 26, 2017, the CS, at the request of GOIS and URDANETA, purchased a
5-million-pound U.K. GILT. On June 20, 2017, the CS, at the request of GOIS, ordered his bank,
to âfree deliverâ the GILT to an account opened for fhe CS at European Financial Institution 2. At
European Financial Institution 2, GOIS would oversee an operation to have the GILT exchanged
for a separate worthless bond, so the funds could ultimately be transferred to and concealed for
URDANETA. Thereafter, the patties continued to discuss the movement of the balance of
~ URDANETAâs portion of the PDVSA funds through 2018, though-no additional funds have been
moved to date. ra
80. Inâ a recorded December 11, 2017 meet with GOIS in the U.K., GOIS explained
how European Company 1 is the front supporting the laundering operation with the fake bond, and
that AMPARAN, CONSPIRATOR 5, and âCONSPIRATOR 6â!! are the directors. GOIS alsoâ ~

lamented their criminal exposure, and advised the CS as follows:

...the faster you get out, the better for you. Because if you... theyâre going to lock
us all up. That... Iâm telling you, [CS], what do you want me to tell you? That itâs

 

'l CONSPIRATOR 6 is a third-party money launderer.

not like that? Itâs the truth, thereâs going to be a day that they are going to lock all
of us up; they are going to lock us up. This will be known. [CS], I have no doubt.
I already saw where the shit comes from. I saw where it comes from, how theyâre
doing things, then in the end, whoever has the money is the one who is going to
have problems. The rest, well, he will have to defend himself, saying âLook, I got
paid here.â Youâll defend yourself in your own way, Iâll defend myself in the same
way. But that will happen

ORTEGA and GUSTAVOâs Efforts to Continue Laundering PDVSA Funds

81. Also beginning in April 2016, ORTEGA and GUSTAVO continued their efforts to
launder ORTEGAâs portion of the PDVSA funds through GUSTAVOâs fake mutual fund, which
culminated in the actual movement of funds about a year later. e |

82. In February 2017, the CS laundered some of ORTEGAâs portion of the PDVSA

âfunds with GUSTAVOâs fake mutual fund structure at ORTEGAâs direction. On February, 21,

2017, GUSTAVO emailed the CS subscription instructions and a subscription agreement for the
fake fund. Per these documents, the name of the find was Global Securities Trade Finance, aw
Cayman Islands entity, and the custodian bank was âUS Financial Institution 1â in New Jersey.
On February 24, 2017, the CS instructed 4 bank in the Bahamas (where a portion the PDVSA funds
were then held) to subscribe to the fund per the instructions in the amount of 5,000,0000 US.
Dollars. Thereafter, on or around February 28, 2017, that amount was wired to U.S. Financial
Institution 1; the fake subscription was obtained by the CS, and the 5,000,000 U.S. Dollars was
available for further use by ORTEGA.

83, In a March 29, 2017 recorded meet in Miami, Florida, the CS asked GUSTAVO
about U.S. Financial Institution 1 and GUSTAVO explained that the bank is controlled by his
partners in Uruguay, who also control another bank in Puerto Rico (âU.S. Financial Institution 2â)

and that they âhave our people in the backâ of the bank.

21
Case :bS-cr-20685-KMW Document friterecd on FLSD Docket O7/24/2018 Page 24 of 33

84. Innumerous BBM chats between the CS and ORTEGA, ORTEGA asks how things
are going with âGâ (GUSTAVO) and acknowledges the ongoing laundering of his (ORTEGAâs)
funds.

85. Later in April 2017, GUSTAVO, with ORTEGAâs agreement, laundered $400,000

. of the $5,000,000 back to the CS as the CSâs âfeeâ for the CSâs role in facilitating the laundering
of ORTEGAâs$5,000,000 to GUSTAVO. The CS provided GUSTAVO with an undercover (UC)
bank account in the name of a shell company in the Southern District of Floridato receive the fee.
On April 24, 2017, GUSTAVO wired $396,000 from U.S. Financial Institution 1 to the UC .
account. To âjustify,â i.e., conceal, the transaction, GUSTAVO created a fake loan contract
between the UC shell company and Global Securities Trade Finance.

86.  Thenext stage of this scheme was the laundering of the fake subscription out of the |
CSâs account and into an account ultimately benefiting ORTEGA in order to eliminate any final
trace of the movement. GUSTAVO and ORTEGA proposed several methods for this, which the
CS rejected. These efforts continue to this day. Over the course of the summer of 2017, however, .
GUSTAVO revealed his connections to yet another complicit US. financial institution, U.S.
Financial Institution 2, in an effort to launder the subscription.

87. In a rec6rded June 7, 2017 meet with GUSTAVO, GUSTAVO told the CS that he
works with U.S.Financial Institution 2, that he knows the owner, and that he can facilitate things:
âSure, and discreet. And the good thing about [U.S. Financial Institution 2] is that without being,
without being in U.S., it is in U.S....in Puerto Rico.â GUSTAVO later introduced the CS to
GUTIERREZ, the majority shareholder of U.S. Financial Institution 2, and the CS and

GUTIERREZ agreed to meet in the future.

22
 

88. On July 31, 2017, GUTIERREZ flew to Miami from Uruguay to meet with the CS. }
During a rÃ©corded meet on July 31, 2017 with GUTIERREZ in Miami, the CS explained td
GUTIERREZ that the CS needed to transfer GUSTAVOâs fund subscription to GUSTAVOâs
âclientâ (ORTEGA) with no trail. The CS and GUTIERREZ discussed options including internal
account-to-account transfers at U.S. Financial Institution 2.

89. In a recorded August 14, 2017 call with GUTIERREZ, GUTIERREZ and the CS
further discussed the subscription to GUSTAVOâs fund. GUTIERREZ offered possible schemes
to justify the transaction using U.S. Financial Institution 2 and agreÃ©d that U.S. Financial
Institution 2 will charge a two-and-a-half percent (2.5%) fee. c

90. During a recorded August 15, 2017 meet with GUSTAVO in Miami, Florida, the
CS complained to GUSTAVO about how explicit GUTIERREZ was regarding their criminal

| | c
activities because he seemed reckless, and the following conversation ensued as GUSTAVO
attempted to reassure the CS that GUTIERREZ did not know about the ORTEGA âkick-backsâ:
cs I mÃ©an, I didnât tell him, âLook, this Ortega
thing is a kick-back,â but I imagine that he
a ~ knows what it is, mean...
GUSTAVO No, no, I havenât told him anything at all, I
: mean, zero [0], zero [0], zero [0]. And I
a will never tell him anything because itâs not
necessary. I never say anything to these
4 people because you donât need to. There
_isnât, I mean... everything is done well.

91. ORTEGA ultimately rejected the U.S. Financial Institution 2 option because he

wanted to avoid the United States. The transfer of the subscription remains unresolved.
GUSTAVOâs Other Laundering Schemes
92. During the course of multiple meetings in Miami with the CS, GUSTAVO

attempted to develop a relationship with the CS as a potential feeder of additional criminal clients

23
Case DLd-cr-20685-KMW Document Erterec on FLSD Docket O7/24/2018 Page 26 of 33

in need of money laundering. Indeed, GUSTAVO would go on to encourage and develop
additional money laundering schemes with the CS, touting his connections at multiple U.S.
financial institutions along the way, including other broker/dealers, in addition to U.S. Financial
Institutions 1 & 2.

93. In a November 8, 2016 recorded meet in Miami, the CS conducted a sting against
GUSTAVO, informing GUSTAVO about a âclientâ who had to buy a plane in Brazil that is âdoing
a delicate jobâ and is âgoing to move ... sensitive merchandise.â Prior to the cs proposing this
transaction, GUSTAVO assured the CS that the CS could speak franklyâas they were âbeyond
good and evil.â The CS explained that the client needed to pay someone in Spain for the plane,
but that the payment could not be traced back to the plane because âthere could be a risk ... the
authorities eventually investigate the plane.â GUSTAVO responded âokâ and âuh huhâ without
hesitation. The CS further explained that source money is in the United States and is completely
clean. GUSTAVO suggested some options and quickly agreed: âWeâll open an account right away
... and weâll make the paymentâ and tat they will justify receiving the payment by selling the
âclientâ a âproduct,â ie., a false investment. The CS and GUSTAVO agree to only charge the
âclientâ ten percent (30,000 U.S. Dollars) in the hopes that he will do more business with them.

94. Thereafter, GUSTAVO and the CS discussed the logistics of the transfer on several

â occasions. In Jariuary 9, 2017 recorded meet, the CS explained to GUSTAVO that the CS was
worried about ORTEGA and the money they (Venezuelan kleptocrats) are moving more than the
CS was âwortied about the plane, the DEA.â GUSTAVO responded, âYes, yes.â

95. On January 10, 2017, the CS and GUSTAVO commenced the transaction. Upon

the CS receiving instructions from GUSTAVO, HSI-Miami wired 300,000 U.S. Dollars from a

UC account in the Southern District of Florida to a U.S. Wells Fargo account held by Global

24
Case 1: bS-cr-20685-KMW Document friterecd on FLSD Docket O7/24/2018 Page 2? of 33

Securities Management LLC, and, on or around January 13, 2017, the funds were received in a
UC account in Spain as instructed. As previously agreed, GUSTAVO emailed the CS a fake
300,000 U.S. Dollar loan contract to support the initial transaction as well as an invoice from
Global Securities Management in the amount of 30,000 U.S. Dollars for âLoan Structuring.â
KRULLâs Conspires to Launder Additional PDVSA Funds with GUSTAVO

96. In October 2016, the CS met with KRULL in Panama. KRULL explained that he
was looking for a bank to deposit approximately 600,000,000 U.S. Dollars: from a currency
exchange with PDVSA on behalf of a client, âCONSPIRATOR 7,â!? and which the CS learned
were located in Gazprombank. The CS stated the CS could exploreâsome options but needed a
contract proving the source of funds. On November 8, 2016, KRULL explained that he had the
contract. In a November 17, 2016 WhatsApp chat, KRULL asked if the CS had âthe hushâ
(meaning hushmail, an encrypted email provider), and the CS provided a hushmail address. That
same day a PDVSA loan contract arrived at tle CSâs hushmail account.

97. | The PDVSA contract that the CS received from KRULL was an amendment to the
original contract between PDYSA âand Rantor, and doubled the credit line from 7.2 to 14 billion
Bolivars. The amendment ,was dated May 25, 2015, and specifically incorporated the initial
PDVSA loan contract.â

98. Over the course of the next few weeks, KRULL continued to press the issue over
WhatsApp chats, explaining his client was in a âhurry.â On November 30, 2016, the CS and
KRULL met again in Panama. Per the CS, KRULL explained that the funds came from exchange

contracts which generated around 1.2 billion U.S. Dollars. KRULL explained that, in addition to

 

2 CONSPIRATOR 7 is another reported billionaire member of the âboliburguÃ©sâ and owner of a
television network in Venezuela.

25
 

the 600-million-Dollar solution for CONSPIRATOR 7, KRULL needed an additional solution for
200 million U.S. Dollars held in European Financial Institution 1 in the name of a straw owner,
âCONSPIRATOR 8.â (The CS recognized CONSPIRATOR 8 as a straw owner previously
proposed to be used to conceal money for the stepsons of VENEZUELAN OFFICIAL 2, a.k.a,
âlos chamos,â during a prior meeting with the CONSPIRATOR 8, CONVIT, and âlos chamos.âââ)

99. On November 30, 2016, KRULL sent the CS a WhatsApp message with photos of
CONSPIRATORS 7 and 8âs Venezuelan passports. KRULL also forwarded an email to the CS
explaining the European Financial Institution 1 structure; the email was in fact a string of
previously forwarded emails attaching documents from Buropean Financial Institution 1, which
had been sent from AMPARAN to âCONSPIRATOR 9,â to CONSPIRATOR 7, to KRULL, and
to the CS. . |

100. In early December 2016, the CS infotmed KRULL of a solution for laundering the
additional PDVSA funds. The CS ultimately pfoposed GUSTAVO and his mutual-fund laundering
solution. On December 21, 2016, KRULL sent the CS a resume for CONSPIRATOR 8, whom
KRULL referred to as his âbuddy.* In a later recorded January 7, 2017 phone call with KRULL,
the CS explained that he could not use the CONSPIRATOR 8 resume, noting ââthis shit is a joke.â
KRULL agreed, âYesyitâs a joke.... I agree, I agree.â |

101. In a recorded January 9, 2017 meet with GUSTAVO in Miami, the cs asked
GUSTAVO for a solution similar to ORTEGAâs for CONSPIRATORS 7 & 8, and GUSTAVO -
immediately agreed. GUSTAVO noted that CONSPIRATOR 7 has one of the wealthiest fortunes
from the ââchavismo.ââ GUSTAVO walked through all the different laundering options for both and
how to handle any âK YCâ issues. KRULL later agreed to the solution presented by GUSTAVO,

and in BBM chats would acknowledge âGustavoâ when inquiring of the status. The CS and

26
 

KRULL and the CS and GUSTAVO had numerous recorded conversations and message chats
about the scheme over the course of months.

102. In a January 10, 2017 recorded. conversation, KRULL noted that
âTCONSPIRATOR 7]â is asking if the money can be sent. In another, on January 23, 2017,
KRULL said the money at European Financial Institution 1 is ready to be moved to
CONSPIRATOR 8 and thatââI met the dude, and also met the guy that represents him.â The CS
asked, âAre these the guyâs sons?â (meaning the stepsons of VENEZUELAN OFFICIAL 2), and
KRULL responded, âNah. Donât, donât, donât ask.â

103. Ina January 31, 2017 recorded call, the CS informed KRULL that he is in Miami
and both discuss the laundering further. KRULL acknowledged receiving money from the.
European Financial Institution 1 accounts before (i.e., other laundering activity) when he described
how the wires work. <

104. On March 7, 2017, KRULL sÃ©nt the CS a WhatsApp chat and explained that the
clients are asking about GUSTAVOâs fuitd being in the United States. In a March 7, 2017 recorded
call, KRULL advised that â[CONSPIRATOR 7|â is worried, and the CS explained that the fund
is not in the United States, but that GUSTAVO has offices in the United States (Miami and New
York). The CS explainÃ©d that GUSTAVO lives in Miami. KRULL asked if GUSTAVO can fly to
Panama, and the-CS assured KRULL he could.

105. âOn March 16, 2017, the CS met with KRULL and CONSPIRATOR 8 in Panama,
and at one point called GUSTAVO (who was not in Panama) to discuss the laundering operation.
During the meeting, CONSPIRATOR 8 stated that he ârepresented three persons.â After the
meeting, KRULL confided to the CS that he had once seen CONSPIRATOR 8 at CONSPIRATOR

7âs office having lunch with âlos chamos,â i.e., the stepsons of VENEZUELAN OFFICIAL 2.

106. Inarecorded April 5, 2017 call with KRULL, KRULL stated that CONSPIRATOR
8 was worried about wiring funds to purchase GUSTAVOâs fraudulent fund to U.S. Financial
Institution 1 in New Jersey because he was worried about using U.S. banks. KRULL explained
that he told CONSPIRATOR 8 it was irrelevant because all U.S. Dollar wire transactions travel
through correspondent banks in the United States regardless.

107. Ina recorded April 14, 2017 meet in Miami with KRULL, KRULL and the CS
discussed GUSTAVO and CONSPIRATOR 7 and the plan to launder the other PDVSA funds.

108. GUSTAVO and KRULL would continue to discuss this scheme with the CS for
months thereafter. For instance, in a recorded call with KRULL on August 2, 2017, the CS told
KRULL, âI am going to be with GUSTAVO tomorrow ... and heâs going to ask me about the fund
with the children.â KRULL explained that he is not sure, but that âCONSPIRATOR 7â may be
doing something on it with âChenteâ (AMPARAN) had explained that he (KRULL) speaks mostly
to â[CONSPIRATOR 8]â about it because heâis âthe client.â

109. Records obtained from erfail search warrants confirm the flow of the PDVSA funds
from PDVSA to the defendants and other conspirators through European Financial Institution 1.
For instance, a September 201 5 email circulated among AMPARAN and CONSPIRATORS 5 and:
6 with the subject lineââNumeros [CONSPIRATOR 7] includes an attachment titled âOperation
600k,â which contains the following work sheets:

a. A work sheet titled âDetailed Income from PDVSAâ shows ten
transfers from PDVSA from December 29, 2014 through February 3, 2015 totaling
511,913,270.74 Euros. .

b. A work sheet titled âSummary of the 600 Operationâ shows that, of

the 511 million Euros: 20,476,530.83 was assigned to European Financial

28

Institution 1 as a 4% fee; 227,265,537.52 Euros went to the âBOLIâ (CONVIT andâ
CONSPIRATOR 2); 159,085,876.26 Euros went to âCHAMOSâ (the stepsons of
VENEZUELAN OFFICIAL 2); and 68,179,661.26 Euros went to CONSPIRATOR
7. The remaining 36,905 ,664.87 Euros was accounted for as the âCostâ of the initial
7.2 billion Bolivars used to obtain the 511 million Euros.
c. Further worksheets account for how each recipient moved the
money. The âBOLIâ for instance moved 78.8 million Euros to the CS and the
majority of the rest through apparent shell companies, Volbor Vontobel and
Vencon Holding. CONSPIRATOR 7 sent dozens of US, Dollar wires through
banks in Malta and Austria, including to aviation and yacht services as well as
brokerage companies in Miami, Florida.
These records not only exhibit the conspiracy in blint detail, but confirm the connection among
KRULL and the additional conspirators and the initial 78.8 million Euros in PDVSA funds
received by the CS. <
KRULLâs Additional V Venezuelan Laundering Schemes

110. Throughout,the course of KRULLâs scheme to launder the additional PDVSA
funds with the CS, KRULL presented other laundering schemes to the CS: One of the schemes
involved a relative of VENEZUELAN OFFICIAL 3 who needed a way to receive kickbacks from
foreign law firms who had been hired by the Government of Venezuela.

111. KRULL first approached the CS with this scheme in the summer of 2017 because

KRULL needed a laundering structure for receiving the kickbacks. Both KRULL and the CS

agreed that GUSTAVO was again a good laundering option.

29
Case :1S-cr-20685-KMW Document frierecd on FLSD Docket 7/24/2018 Pade 32 of 33

112. On June 29, 2017, KRULL called the CS and, in a recorded conversation, the CS
told KRULL that he is in Los Angeles, California. KRULL said he has to be âcandid and directâ
and stated:

Uh, Iâm sitting here with, with, with, with the [title of VENEZUELAN OFFICIAL

3]âs brother.... And, and, and well, they, they, they have earned in the last years a

payment theyâre going to receive that is for five [5]....Okay? And, and, and we

have been talking about the, the, the options they, they might have. Right? And,

and, and I donât know if, if, if you have something that you, that you might think
of, as to how it can be, uh, things can be structured. Right?

113. The CS noted that it may be difficult based on the recipient's piofile, but said they
can talk more tomorrow and explained he will be flying to Miami then. Ina later recorded call on
June 29, 2017, KRULL further specified that these were payments from law firms that had handled
international arbitrations on the Venezuelan governmentâs behalf with international companies and
had charged the government a lot of money (5,000,000 U.S. Dollars). In a recorded call the next
day, June 30, 2018, the CS, KRULL, and VENEZUELAN OFFICIAL 3âs brother discussed ways
to launder the payment which was again explicitly described as payments deriving from law firms
who represented Venezuelan government in arbitrations. Different options for laundering the
payments and âKYCâ requiremÃ©nts were discussed.

114. Ina recordÃ©d August 25, 2017 meet with GUSTAVO in Miami, the CS explained
that KRULL had two sjients related to VENEZUELAN OFFICIAL 3 who needed a way to launder
the payments they are going to receive from attorneys who were hired by the Venezuelan
government. The CS specifically stated âthe lawyers are giving them their. kick backsâ and
GUSTAVO responded, âMm-hmmm.â The CS then suggested that the lawyers themselves would
pay the kickback, and GUSTAVO immediately corrected him:

No, they canât pay these two [2] guys. No, thatâs impossible.... Just imagine.

Specially nowadays with OFAC, and with all of these people reviewing every
money transfer every day. .... Brother, thatâs kindergarten Algebra. Right? Well,

30
 

we will have to give a vehicle to each one of these guys...A private fund...The
same thing we did for [ORTEGA].

115. Inrecorded meetings on August 29, 2017 and November 14, 2017 with KRULL in
Miami, the CS and KRULL further discussed the kick-back laundering scheme.
CONCLUSION
116. Based on the foregoing, probable cause exists that the defendants conspired to
launder monetary instruments, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1956(h), and
did travel in and use facilities of interstate and foreign commerce to further the laundering

activities, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1952. y -

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Wednesday, July 25, 2018

Two Members of Billion-Dollar Venezuelan Money Laundering Scheme Arrested

Two alleged participants in a billion-dollar international scheme to launder funds embezzled from Venezuelan state-owned oil company PDVSA
using Miami, Florida real estate and sophisticated false-investment schemes were arrested yesterday and today.

Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Benjamin Greenberg of the
Southern District of Florida and Special Agent in Charge Mark Selby of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcementâs Homeland Security
Investigationsâ (HSI) Miami Field Office made the announcement.

Matthias Krull, 44, a German national and Panamanian resident, and Gustavo Adolfo Hernandez Frieri, 45, a Colombian national and naturalized
U.S. citizen, were charged in a criminal complaint with conspiracy to commit money laundering. The complaint also charged Francisco Convit
Guruceaga, 40; Jose Vincente Amparan Croquer, aka, âChente,â 44; Carmelo Urdaneta Aqui, 44; and Abraham Eduardo Ortega, 51, all
Venezuelan nationals; and Hugo Andre Ramalho Gois, 39, a Portuguese national, and Marcelo Federico Gutierrez Acosta y Lara, 40, a Uruguayan
national, for their alleged participation in the scheme. These defendants remain at large. Krull was arrested last night in Miami and had his
initial court appearance earlier today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Alicia M. Otazo-Reyes in Miami. Krull is scheduled to have a pre-trial
detention hearing on July 30, and a preliminary hearing on Aug. 8. Frieri was arrested today in Sicily, Italy and faces extradition proceedings.

According to the criminal complaint, the conspiracy in this case allegedly began in December 2014 with a currency exchange scheme that was
designed to embezzle around $600 million from PDVSA, obtained through bribery and fraud, and the defendantsâ efforts to launder a portion of
the proceeds of that scheme. By May 2015, the conspiracy had allegedly doubled in amount to $1.2 billion embezzled from PDVSA. PDVSA is
Venezuelaâs primary source of income and foreign currency (namely, U.S. Dollars and Euros).

The complaint alleges that surrounding and supporting these false-investment laundering schemes are complicit money managers, brokerage
firms, banks and real estate investment firms in the United States and elsewhere, operating as a network of professional money launderers.

The alleged conspirators include former PDVSA officials, professional third-party money launderers, and members of the Venezuelan elite,
sometimes known as âboliburguÃ©s.â

The charges contained in the complaint are merely allegations and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a
reasonable doubt in a court of law.

This case is the result of the ongoing efforts by the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF) âOperation Money Flight,â a
partnership between and among federal, state and local law enforcement agencies. The OCDETF mission is to identify, investigate and
prosecute high-level members of drug trafficking enterprises, bringing together the combined expertise and unique abilities of federal, state
and local law enforcement.

HSI Miami, HS! London, HSI Rome and HSI Madrid investigated this case. The case is being prosecuted by Assistant Chief David Johnson of the
Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Francisco R. Maderal of the Southern District of Floridaâs International Narcotics
and Money Laundering Section.

The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs provided substantial assistance in this matter and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the
National Crime Agency of the United Kingdom and Italian, Spanish and Maltese law enforcement authorities provided assistance. The Fraud
Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice Departmentâs FCPA

enforcement efforts can be found at www. justice. gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.

INDICTMENT
THE GRAND JURY CHARGES:
GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

At all relevant times, unless otherwise specified:

1. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (âFCPAâ), as amended,
Title 15, United States Code, Sections 78dd-1, et seg., was enacted by Congress for
the purpose of, among other things, making it unlawful to act corruptly in
furtherance of an offer, promise, authorization, or payment of money or anything

of value, directly or indirectly, to a foreign official for the purpose of obtaining or

retaining business for, or directing business to, any person.

2. Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (âPDVSAâ) was the Venezuelan state-
owned and state-controlled oil company. PDVSA and its subsidiaries and affiliates
were responsible for the exploration, production, refining, transportation, and trade
in energy resources in Venezuela and provided funding for other operations of the
Venezuelan government. PDVSA Services, Inc. was the U.S.-based affiliate of
PDVSA located in Houston, Texas, that, at various times, was responsible for
international purchasing on behalf of PDVSA. Bariven S.A. (âBarivenââ) was the
PDVSA procurement subsidiary responsible for equipment purchases. PDVSA
and its wholly owned subsidiaries, including PDVSA Services, Inc. and Bariven,
(hereinafter collectively referred to as âPDVSAââ) were âinstrumentalitiesâ of the
Venezuelan government as that term is used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States
Code, Section 78dd-2(h)(2)(A). PDVSA officers and employees were âforeign
officialsâ as that term is used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section
78dd-2(h)(2)(A).

3, PDVSA awarded contracts for energy services and equipment in a
number of ways, including through a competitive bidding process. One such
competitive bidding process began with a PDVSA purchasing analyst assembling a
bidding panel, which identified those companies that would be invited to submit

bids in connection for a particular project. PDVSA would then issue a request for

quotation to the companies included on the bidding panel and those companies
would in turn submit formal bids, from which a winner would be selected.
PDVSA also awarded sole source contracts, which were not subject to a
competitive bidding process. Ultimately, all contracts needed to be approved by
more senior PDVSA employees.

4. Beginning in at least 2011 and continuing until at least 2013, LUIS
CARLOS DE LEON PEREZ, NERVIS GERARDO VILLALOBOS
CARDENAS, CESAR DAVID RINCON GODOY, ALEJANDRO ISTURIZ
CHIESA, and RAFAEL ERNESTO REITER MUNOZ (collectively, the
âDefendantsâ described more fully below), solicited PDVSA vendors for bribes
and kickbacks in exchange for providing assistance to those vendors in connection
with their PDVSA business, including assisting them in obtaining PDVSA
contracts and assisting them in receiving payment priority over other vendors for
outstanding PDVSA invoices during the Venezuelan liquidity crisis.

5. The Defendants then laundered the proceeds of the bribery scheme
through numerous financial transactions, including through international wire
transfers to and from bank accounts that they opened in Switzerland, Curacao, and
elsewhere in the names of various companies.

6. The Defendants sought to conceal the nature of the scheme through

various complex financial transactions by directing bribe payments to be sent to
various recipients other than the intended PDVSA officials, including companies,
intermediaries, relatives, friends, creditors, and close personal associates of the
PDVSA officials.

The Defendants

7. Defendant LUIS CARLOS DE LEON PEREZ (âDE LEONâ) was
a dual citizen of the United States and Venezuela. DE LEON was thus a
âdomestic concernâ as that term is used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code,

CESAR RINCON was employed by PDVSA and its subsidiaries, including
Bariven, in various capacities, including as the general manager of Bariven.

CESAR RINCON was a âforeign officialâ as that term is used in the FCPA, Title
eet
o
4

15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2(h)(2)(A).

agent, and shareholder of a âdomestic concernâ as those terms are used in the
FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2(h)(1).

32. âSwiss Company A,â whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was
a Swiss wealth management firm.

33. âSwiss Banker 1,â an individual whose identity is known to the Grand
Jury, was a partner in Swiss Company A.

34. âOfficial A,â an individual whose identity is known to the Grand
Jury, was at all relevant times employed by PDVSA, including as a senior
executive of Bariven.

35. âOfficial B,â an individual whose identity is known to the Grand Jury,
was at all relevant times a senior Venezuelan government official.

36. Official A and Official B were each a âforeign officialâ as that term is
used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Sections 78dd-2(h)(2)(A).

Other Entities

37. âLaw Firm 1,â whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was a
U.S.-based law firm.

COUNT ONE
(Conspiracy to Commit Money Laundering â 18 U.S.C. Â§ 1956(h))

39. Paragraphs | through 38 are realleged and incorporated by reference
as though fully set forth herein.
40. From in or around 2011 and continuing until at least 2013, in the

Southern District of Texas and elsewhere, the defendants,

LUIS CARLOS DE LEON PEREZ
NERVIS GERARDO VILLALOBOS CARDENAS
CESAR DAVID RINCON GORDOY
ALEJANDRO ISTURIZ CHIESA
and
RAFAEL ERNESTO REITER MUNOZ

did knowingly conspire, confederate, and agree with each other and others known
and unknown to the Grand Jury to commit offenses under Title 18, United States
Code, Section 1956, namely:

a. knowing that the property involved in a financial transaction represented
the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity, to conduct or attempt to
conduct such a financial transaction which in fact represented the
proceeds of specified unlawful activity, knowing that the transaction is
designed in whole and in part to conceal and disguise the nature, the
location, the source, the ownership, and the control of the proceeds of

specified unlawful activity, namely, bribery of a foreign official, a felony

11
violation of the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Sections 78dd-2, in
violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1956(a)(1)(B); and

b. with the intent to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity,

namely, bribery of a foreign official, a felony violation of the FCPA,
Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2, transport, transmit, or
transfer funds from a place in the United States to a place outside the
United States, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section
1956(a)(2)(A).

Manner and Means of the Conspiracy

41. The manner and means by which DE LEON, VILLALOBOS,
CESAR RINCON, ISTURIZ, REITER, and their co-conspirators sought to
accomplish the purpose of the conspiracy included, among other things, the
following, while in the Southern District of Texas and elsewhere:

42. DELEON, VILLALOBOS, CESAR RINCON, ISTURIZ, and
REITER promised Rincon, Shiera, and others known and unknown to the Grand
Jury assistance with getting paid on outstanding invoices on PDVSA contracts, as
well as assistance with winning new PDVSA contracts, in exchange for bribe

payments.
43. DELEON, VILLALOBOS, CESAR RINCON, and ISTURIZ

solicited assistance, and in turn Rincon, Shiera, and Swiss Banker 1, together with

12
others, assisted the PDVSA officials in opening bank accounts, including bank
accounts in Switzerland, for the PDVSA officials and their co-conspirators to
receive bribe payments.

44. DE LEON, VILLALOBOS, CESAR RINCON, ISTURIZ, and
REITER directed bribe payments to be sent to various recipients other than the
intended PDVSA officials, including companies, intermediaries, relatives, friends,
creditors, and close personal associates of the PDVSA officials, for the purpose of
concealing and disguising the nature, source, and ownership of the bribe payments.

45. DELEON and VILLALOBOS, together with others, engaged in
monetary transactions among their various accounts designed to conceal the nature,
source, and ownership of the proceeds of the specified unlawful activity.

46. Swiss Banker 1 and CESAR RINCON, each and together with
others, created false justifications for certain of the bribes, including invoices for
services that were never performed, for the purpose of concealing and disguising
the nature, source, and ownership of those bribe payments.

47. Rincon and Shiera, together with others, directed the wire transfer of,
and caused to be wired, bribe payments from bank accounts which were frequently
in the name of companies other than the companies being awarded PDVSA
contracts and receiving payments from PDVSA, for the purpose of concealing and

disguising the nature, source, and ownership of the bribe payments.

13
Acts In Furtherance of the Conspiracy

48. Beginning in at least 2010, Venezuela began to experience a liquidity
crisis as the profits earned through PDVSA, which historically had been a
significant source of revenue to the Venezuelan government as a result of its oil
reserves, were insufficient to meet the governmentâs expenses. Numerous analysts
began to speculate that PDVSA could default on its debt, and the government
made public commitments for PDVSA to increase oi! production.

49. Given these liquidity problems, PDVSA was unable to pay all of its
vendors in a timely manner, but remained under pressure to continue to escalate oil
production.

50. In or about 2011, Rincon and Shiera were approached by a group of
individuals who consisted of then-current PDVSA officials and individuals outside
PDVSA with influence at PDVSA, including DE LEON, VILLALOBOS, and
ISTURIZ, referred to as the âmanagement team.â The management team offered
to give Rinconâs and Shieraâs companies payment priority over other PDVSA
vendors, ensuring that Rinconâs and Shieraâs companies would get at least partial
payment on outstanding PDVSA invoices, and to provide Rinconâs and Shieraâs
companies with assistance in winning future PDVSA business, in exchange for
providing a bribe to the management team in the amount of 10% of all payments

Rincon and Shiera received from PDVSA. The management team made similar

14
offers to other vendors known and unknown to the Grand Jury. In addition,
individual members of the management team solicited additional bribe payments
from Rincon and Shiera.

51. DE LEON and VILLALOBOS explained that the bribe proceeds
would be split and would be shared among DE LEON, VILLALOBOS, CESAR
RINCON, ISTURIZ, REITER, OFFICIAL A, and OFFICIAL B.

52. Rincon and Shiera agreed to make the payments to the management
team in exchange for payment priority and assistance in winning future PDVSA
contracts.

53. Because they were able to guarantee payment through the corrupt
scheme, Rincon and Shiera continued to supply goods and services to PDVSA,
thereby enabling PDVSA to continue to do business with such vendors who might
not otherwise accept the risk of non-payment.

54. Payment allocation decisions for vendors were typically documented
by Bariven in weekly reports entitled, as translated into English, âProposal for
Payment to International Providers for the Procurement of Materials, Equipment,
and Food in Foreign Markets On Behalf of PDVSA and its Subsidiaries.â These
documents, generally referred to in shorthand (as translated into English) as the
payment proposals or proposals, typically contained a âPremiseâ stating, as

translated into English, âThe invoicing included in this payment schedule was

15
coordinated with the international offices of procurement (Houston and the
Netherlands) in line with the agreed upon payment conditions and the operational
needs coordinated between the hierarchic levels of Bariven and PDVSAâs
different businesses to ensure the delivery of materials and equipment in order to
safeguard the operational continuity of the Industry,â then set forth the debt and
proposed payments to selected vendors. The payment proposals were the subject
of extensive communications among the Defendants and their co-conspirators,
including discussions about how much would be allocated to and among Rinconâs
and Shieraâs companies and discussions about the bribe payments due to the
Defendants as a function of how much Rinconâs and Shieraâs companies were
receiving from PDVSA. CESAR RINCON and ISTURIZ had responsibility for
developing and approving the payment proposals, which were ultimately
authorized by Official A.
Account Set-Up

55. In order to facilitate the bribe payments and conceal their nature and
ownership, DE LEON and VILLALOBOS and their co-conspirators engaged
Swiss Company A to set up Swiss bank accounts into which bribe payments could
be received and to assist in providing justifications for the payments.

56. Ultimately, a number of accounts, in Switzerland and elsewhere, were

used in connection with the scheme. These accounts were used to funnel the bribes

16
from, to, and through multiple destinations before reaching their ultimate recipient.

57. âSwiss Account 1,â whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was a
Swiss bank account for which DE LEON was a beneficial owner and
VILLALOBOS and DE LEON were authorized signers. Swiss Account 1 was
used in connection with the scheme.

58. âSwiss Account 2,â whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was a
Swiss bank account. Swiss Account 2 was used in connection with the scheme.

59. âSwiss Account 3,â whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was a
Swiss bank account. Swiss Account 3 was used in connection with the scheme.

60. âSwiss Account 4,â whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was a
Swiss bank account. Swiss Account 4 was used in connection with the scheme.

61. âSwiss Account 5,â whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was a
Swiss bank account owned and controlled by Rincon and Shiera. Swiss Account 5
was used in connection with the scheme.

62. âSwiss Account 6,â whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was a
Swiss bank account owned and controlled by Shiera. Swiss Account 6 was used in
connection with the scheme.

63. âSwiss Account 7,â whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was a

Swiss bank account owned and controlled by ISTURIZ. Swiss Account 7 was

17
used in connection with the scheme.

64. âSwiss Account 8,â whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was a
Swiss bank account owned and controlled by CESAR RINCON. Swiss Account
8 was used in connection with the scheme.

65. âSwiss Account 9,â whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was a
Swiss bank account. Swiss Account 9 was used in connection with the scheme.

66. âCuracao Account 1,â whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was
a Curacaoan bank account. Curacao Account | was used in connection with the
scheme.

67. âU.S. Account 1,â whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was a
U.S. bank account. U.S. Account 1 was used in connection with the scheme.

68. Some of these accounts were not simply used to funnel bribe
payments, but also to provide false justifications for the payments themselves. For
example, on or about September 12, 2011, a letter and services agreement was
submitted through Swiss Company A to a Swiss bank in connection with the
request to open Swiss Account 1. The letter set forth a purported sub-contracting
arrangement between Swiss Account 5 and Swiss Account | in which Swiss
Account | was to assist Swiss Account 5 in providing services to Rincon Company
1. Similarly, on or about April 19, 2012, Swiss Accounts 2, 3, and 4 sent a letter to

Swiss Company A and Swiss Account | stating the general fund distribution from

18
Swiss Account | to Swiss Accounts 2, 3, and 4 and setting forth various services
purportedly provided by Swiss Accounts 2, 3, and 4 on behalf of Swiss Account 1
to Swiss Account 5 and Shiera Company 5.

69. The Defendants, Shiera, Rincon, and their co-conspirators
communicated, including via e-mail, phone, and various messaging applications,
about the account set-up and the need to submit documentation to justify the
payments. For example, on or about September 8, 2011, Shiera sent
VILLALOBOS a message using BlackBerry Messenger (âBBMââ) stating, as
translated into English, âThe institution has not accepted the stick. They are asking
me for invoices and purchase orders. I already submitted them. I hope it is
resolved tomorrow.â The conspirators frequently used the word âstickâ (as
translated into English) to refer to money.

70. The Defendants ultimately established a complex web of bank
accounts through which to conduct the financial transactions in connection with the
scheme and conceal the nature and ownership of the proceeds. On or about
September 16, 2011, Swiss Banker 1 wrote to Shiera, VILLALOBOS, and DE
LEON to report that Swiss Company A had set up four bank accounts â Swiss
Account 1, which Swiss Banker | referred to as the âmain account,â Swiss
Account 2, which Swiss Banker 1 identified as being for VILLALOBOS, Swiss

Account 3, which Swiss Banker 1 identified as being for DE LEON, and Swiss

19
Account 4, which Swiss Banker 1 identified as being for Official A. Swiss Banker
1 concluded the e-mail by stating, âWe will email you next week the new
account numbers and the wiring instructions to begin transfer of funds into the
main a/c ([Swiss Account 1]) for distribution into the 3 accounts.â

71. Swiss Company A, facilitated by Rincon and Shiera, also assisted the
Defendants in opening individual accounts in the names of various entities rather
than in the Defendantsâ own names. For example, on or about February 1, 2013,
CESAR RINCON sent Shiera an e-mail attaching his passport and utility bill.
Shiera then forwarded this information to Swiss Banker 1, who requested in
addition a copy of CESAR RINCONâs curriculum vitae. Swiss Banker | asked
Shiera, âShall I go ahead and order a new Nevis company for Cesar?â Shiera
replied to the e-mail, noting his agreement.

72. Onor about February 6, 2013, Swiss Banker 1 sent Shiera an e-mail
stating, âA new Nevis company called [Swiss Account 8] will be formed with
Cesar as the Director/BO/Shareholder.â

Payments to the Management Team and
Official Assistance to Rincon and Shiera

73. Rincon and Shiera made payments for the benefit of DE LEON,
VILLALOBOS, CESAR RINCON, ISTURIZ, and REITER using a variety of
bank accounts in the United States (including in the Southern District of Texas),

Switzerland, and Panama, to a variety of bank accounts, including, but not limited

20
to, the accounts referenced in Paragraphs 57 to 67 above.

74. For example, in total, accounts controlled by Rincon and Shiera
transferred over $27 million to Swiss Account 1, which transferred over $10
million to Swiss Account 2, over $16 million to Swiss Account 3, and over $1
million to Swiss Account 4, in connection with the scheme.

75. In exchange for these bribe and kickback payments, DE LEON,
VILLALOBOS, CESAR RINCON, ISTURIZ, and REITER provided
assistance to Rincon and Shiera in getting paid on outstanding PDVSA invoices
and obtaining new PDVSA contracts.

76. For example, on or about October 10, 2011, ISTURIZ sent Shiera a
BBM message stating, as translated into English, âI got for you and Pelon [Rincon]
[Rincon Company 4] 1.3mm [Rincon Company 2] 1.2mm and [Shiera Company 2]
6.9.â Shiera replied, as translated into English, âThat [Shiera Company 2] is his. I
need in [Shiera Company 1] and [Shiera Company 3]. Check it please.â

ISTURIZ later responded, as translated into English, âShit, bro, I had sent it
already! Let me see what I can do!â, to which Shiera replied, âChange it please.â
ISTURIZ responded, as translated into English, âPumita! [Shiera] Relax, let Piojo

[ISTURIZ] pamper you!â, to which Shiera replied, as translated into English, âIâm

21
in need of love $$$$$$ hahahaha.â

77. Consistent with ISTURIZâs BBM message, on or about October 17,
2011, PDVSA sent $6,980,000 to Shiera Company 2.

78. After several inter-company transfers, the funds referenced in
Paragraph 77 above were ultimately transferred to Rincon Company 2. On or
about October 26, 2011, Rincon Company 2 transferred $515,513.20 to Swiss
Account 1. Shortly thereafter, on or about November 2, 2011, Shiera Company 5
transferred $179,552.52 to Swiss Account 1. Then, on or about November 16,
2011, Swiss Account | transferred $100,000 to Swiss Account 2, $330,000 to
Swiss Account 3, and $215,000 to Swiss Account 4.

79. The Defendants frequently checked with Shiera and Rincon on the
status of the bribe payments. For example, on or about December 20, 2011,
VILLALOBOS sent Shiera a BBM message stating, as translated into English,
âdonât forget to talk with your administrator, it Is vital the flow comes in
December,â which the conspirators understood to refer to bribe payments. Shiera
responded, as translated into English, âHe just confirmed youâll have it before this
Friday.â

80. Onor about December 22, 2011, Shiera Company 5 made two

transfers to Swiss Account 1, one in the amount of $299,901.85 and another in the

22
amount of $362,485.68.

81. Rincon and Shiera frequently used DE LEON and VILLALOBOS as
intermediaries for communications with or about the PDVSA officials. For
example, on or about November 24, 2011, Shiera sent VILLALOBOS a BBM
message stating, as translated into English, âBrother, Piojo [ISTURIZ] never fails.
He put mine at like $3.5M on the proposal and 5 for the ones from Pelon [Rincon]
according to what we talked about at dinner. Give him support.â VILLALOBOS
responded, as translated into English, âThat guy is good.â

82. In addition to help getting paid on outstanding invoices, Rincon and
Shiera also asked the Defendants for their assistance in winning PDVSA contracts.
For example, on or about January 4, 2012, Shiera sent VILLALOBOS a BBM
message requesting VILLALOBOSâs assistance in securing a contract over a
competitor to supply equipment in relation to a PDVSA project.

83. On or about February 8, 2012, Shiera sent ISTURIZ a BBM message
asking, as translated into English, âWhatâs happened with the Motorgenerators?â
to which ISTURIZ replied, as translated into English, âCesar must sign it! [ll tell
him.â

84. The Defendants corresponded with Rincon and Shiera about PDVSA

bidding panels as well as the official actions the Defendants would take on behalf

of Rincon and Shiera. For example, on or about February 24, 2012, Shiera sent

23
ISTURIZ a BBM message with a proposed panel of bidders for an electric
equipment panel. ISTURIZ responded, as translated into English, âGood! Give
me the panels for the others!! Get people moving on that! Look, I have all the
purchasers from my office beating them hard,â to which Shiera replied, as
translated into English, âThat is my Piojo.â

85. In addition to allowing Rincon and Shiera to have input on PDVSA
bidding panels, as discussed in Paragraph 84 above, the Defendants gave Rincon
and Shiera inside information on upcoming PDVSA projects so that they could
choose the projects that their companies bid on. For example, on or about
February 28, 2012, ISTURIZ e-mailed Rincon and Shiera, stating, as translated
into English, âIâm sending you a list of the process that we need to start tomorrow.
Theyâre processes for the E&P [exploration and production] and Gas moments. I
started with e&p, because thatâs where the strength lies! I need to know before 10
am in which processes you want to get involved in and the panel.â

86. Onor about March 1, 2012, Rincon responded to the email from
ISTURIZ referenced in Paragraph 85 above, copying Shiera, stating, as translated
into English, âAttached you will find what we are going to work on highlighted in
YELLOW. These are drilling parts and equipment. There is one from Abraham.â

Attached was a highlighted list of equipment PDVSA sought to purchase with the

24
corresponding internal budgets.

87. The Defendants frequently sent Rincon and Shiera updates of the
money they expected to receive in bribes in exchange for the payments Rincon and
Shiera were receiving on outstanding PDVSA invoices as a result of the bribery
scheme. The Defendants occasionally sent Rincon and Shiera the payment
proposals themselves, either in draft form for input or in final form so Rincon and
Shiera could see how much money their companies were expected to receive (and,
in turn, how much they would need to pay in bribes). For example, on or about
January 5, 2012, ISTURIZ sent Rincon an e-mail stating, as translated into
English, âI need you to check these numbers. They are the payments for payment
proposal. The date that is on each payment corresponds to the Monday of the
week of the proposal. The date will not coincide with the one on which you
received the money, donât focus on that, just the amounts.â Attached was a
PDVSA payment proposal document setting forth vendors to be paid, (including a
number of Rinconâs companies) and the dates and amounts of the payments.

88. In addition, on or about May 17, 2013, CESAR RINCON sent
himself a PDVSA payment proposal from his PDVSA e-mail account to a personal
e-mail account. He forwarded it to VILLALOBOS, Shiera, and Rincon with the
message, as translated into English, âIâve attached the proposal reviewed and

approved by [Official A].â The attached payment proposal included payments to a

25
number of Shieraâs and Rinconâs companies, including Shiera Company 1, Shiera
Company 2, Shiera Company 3, Rincon Company 2, Rincon Company 5, and
Rincon Company 7.

89. The Defendants also frequently reminded Rincon and Shiera of how
much they owed in bribe payments, using coded or vague language to conceal
what they were talking about. For example, on or about March 15, 2012, DE
LEON sent Shiera a BBM message stating, as translated into English, âWere you
able to able to buy the things? Debt from the friends as of today $1,093,232,â
which the conspirators understood to be a reference to outstanding bribe payments.

90. Within a week of DE LEONâs message, accounts controlled by
Shiera and Rincon then made a series of transfers to Swiss Account 1, totaling just
over $1 million. On or about March 19, 2012, Swiss Account 5 transferred
$536,005.42 to Swiss Account 1. The next day, March 20, 2012, Shiera Company
5 transferred $281,781.34 to Swiss Account |. Finally, on or about March 22,
2012, Shiera Company 5 transferred $193,021.47 to Swiss Account 1.

91. In order to conceal the nature and ownership of the bribe proceeds,
ISTURIZ sent Rincon and Shiera instructions to pay various bank accounts, held
in the names of various companies. ISTURIZ made coded references to paying
bribes in exchange for future PDVSA business. For example, on or about March

22, 2012, ISTURIZ sent Rincon and Shiera an e-mail stating, as translated into

26
English, âHi P and P, Iâm sending you the coordinates in order for you to send me
something to buy coal to keep cooking the stew. ... We can use this account
while weâre opening the other one.â ISTURIZ concluded the e-mail with the
account and wire information for Curacao Account 1.

92. Onor about April 2, 2012, Rincon Company 2 transferred $450,000
from its bank account in the Southern District of Texas to Curacao Account 1.
Over the following several weeks, Curacao Account 1 made a series of transfers to
Swiss Account 7.

93. Onor about May 13, 2012, ISTURIZ sent Rincon and Shiera an e-
mail stating, as translated into English, âDear friends, Iâm sending you the
coordinates to move ahead somewhat on the payments while the other account is
being opened. I need to notify the friend at the bank before the money arrives.
Attached is a spreadsheet showing a summary of the payments over the past 3
weeks.â Set forth below was the account and wire information for Swiss Account
7. Attached was a chart setting forth various Rincon and Shiera companies, the
amounts they had been paid by PDVSA for a three-week period and two figures
representing bribe payments due in the amount of 10% and 2%.

94. On or about May 16, 2012, Rincon Company 2 transferred

$116,949.72 to Curacao Account |. Subsequently, Curagao Account 1 made two

27
transfers to Swiss Account 7.

95. Onor about June 1, 2012, Rincon Company 2 transferred $766,428.39
to Swiss Account 7.

96. Onor about June 18, 2012, ISTURIZ sent Rincon and Shiera an e-
mail stating, as translated into English, âDear colleagues, I am sending you the
Excel file with the summary of the payments and the great debt you have with
Paulo!â

97. Onor about June 19, 2012, Rincon responded to ISTURIZ, stating, as
translated into English, âTo date we have transferred the following amounts:
450,000 [Curacao Account 1], 116,949.72 [Curacao Account 1], 766,428.39
[Swiss Account 7], 367,069.19 [Swiss Account 7]. THE TOTAL IS...USD
1,700,447.30. Paulo, the problem is that sometimes we take the amount
considering the entire payment and sometimes we need to subtract 5% for our
alliesâ... Forgive the trouble but it is being deposited today and this way we have a
difference of USD 0000000000000000000000000000.00.â

98. On or about June 19, 2012, Rincon Company 2 transferred
$367,069.19 to Swiss Account 7.

99. Onor about June 21, 2012, Rincon Company 6 transferred $69,427.81
to Swiss Account 7.

100. Rincon frequently sent confirmations of bribe payments he had made

28
to the defendants. For example, on or about May 15, 2012, Rincon Company 2
transferred $200,000 to Swiss Account 9. The following day, Rincon sent the wire
confirmation to CESAR RINCON.

101. Similarly, on or about June 19, 2012, Rincon Company 2 transferred
$115,000 to Swiss Account 9. On or about June 21, 2012, Rincon forwarded the
wire confirmation to CESAR RINCON, who replied, as translated into English,
âAll good, Thanks.â

102. On several occasions, ISTURIZ referenced the fact that the financial
transactions through which he sought to receive bribe payments were designed to
conceal the nature and ownership of the proceeds. On or about July 12, 2012,
ISTURIZ forwarded account and wire information for U.S. Account 1 from
ISTURIZ Associate 1 to Rincon and Shiera, copying ISTURIZ Associate 1.
ISTURIZ stated, as translated into English, âI am sending the instructions in order
to start using this route. Copy to the person who is responsible for setting
everything up so that it is all really well shielded.â

103. On or about July 24, 2012, Shiera Company 6 transferred $323,045.27
to U.S. Account 1.

104. On or about July 31, 2012, Rincon Company 2 transferred $450,000
from its account in the Southern District of Texas to U.S. Account 1.

105. On or about August 1, 2012, Rincon Company 2 transferred

29
$533,729.77 from its account in the Southern District of Texas to U.S. Account 1.

106. On or about August 10, 2012, U.S. Account 1 transferred $445,785 to
Swiss Account 7.

107. On or about August 13, 2012, U.S. Account 1 transferred $625,056 to

108. On or about August 29, 2012, ISTURIZ sent Rincon and Shiera an e-
mail stating, as translated into English, âI am sending you the list up to this weekâs
proposal, which I am putting together. The numbers are going to stay like this!
Merry Christmas even though it isnât.â Attached were four charts â the first two
set forth various Rincon companies and various Shiera companies, along with the
amounts that each had been paid by PDVSA over the course of several weeks. The
second two, entitled âRRâ and âAS,â respectively, set forth various payment
amounts and payment destinations for bribe payments to ISTURIZ.

109. On or about November 30, 2012, Shiera sent DE LEON a BBM
message stating, as translated into English, âI have $20MM approved to collect for

BBM message stating, as translated into English, â[Official A] wrote to me, he said

115. In order to disguise the nature and ownership of the bribe proceeds,

31
instead of having money sent directly to an account he controlled, REITER
frequently directed bribe money to third parties for his benefit. For example,
REITER directed that some of the money he was owed in connection with the
scheme be used to purchase a condominium in the name of a company controlled
by REITER Relative 1. On or about August 16, 2012, a representative of Law

REITER forwarded Rincon an investment agreement from Production Company

32
A to invest in a film, on or about May 21, 2013, at the direction of Rincon
Associate 1, Rincon Company 7 transferred $1.5 million to Production Company
A. Rincon sent the confirmation of the transfer to REITER by e-mail.

119. On or about September 14, 2013, Rincon, copying CESAR
RINCON, directed a relative by e-mail to send $200,000 to Swiss Account 8.

120. On or about September 16, 2013, Rincon Company 2 transferred

$200,000 to Swiss Account 8.

Gifts and Other Things of Value

121. In addition to monetary bribes, Rincon and Shiera provided the
Defendants with gifts, recreational travel, and other things of value in exchange for
their assistance in connection with Rinconâs and Shieraâs business with PDVSA.

122. For example, on or about November 30, 2011, Shiera received a
reservation confirmation by e-mail for a beach house in Parrot Cay in the Bahamas
made in the name of ISTURIZ, which Shiera then forwarded on to ISTURIZ
noting, as translated into English, âDone, Piojo.â

123. Similarly, on or about June 6, 2013, a luxury hotel in Aruba sent
Shiera confirmations for a number of hotel rooms, including one for CESAR

RINCON and REITER. A note next to both CESAR RINCONâs and

33
REITERâs room confirmations stated, âThis room will be paid by Mr. Shiera.â

purchased a $107,500 armored car from a company in Texas for the benefit of
REITER. On or about March 18, 2013, Rincon Company 2 purchased a second
$107,500 armored car from a company in Texas for the benefit of REITER.

125. On or about August 1, 2013, Rincon purchased a $10,300 handbag for
REITER Relative | at a store in the Southern District of Texas.

126. On or about June 26, 2014, REITER forwarded Rincon invoices for

which DE LEON and VILLALOBOS would receive a portion.

133. At the direction of DE LEON and VILLALOBOS, Rincon and
Shiera, together with others, paid bribes to the management team through the use
of interstate and foreign wires in order to secure any improper business advantage,

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Monday, February 12, 2018

Five Former Venezuelan Government Officials Charged in Money Laundering Scheme Involving
Foreign Bribery

Charges were unsealed today against five former Venezuelan government officials for their alleged participation in an international money
laundering scheme involving bribes made to corruptly secure energy contracts from Venezuelaâs state-owned and state-controlled energy
company, Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA). Two of the five defendants are also charged with conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act (FCPA).

Acting Assistant Attorney General John P. Cronan of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Ryan K. Patrick of the Southern
District of Texas and Special Agent in Charge Mark Dawson of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcementâs Homeland Security Investigations
(HSI) in Houston made the announcement.

Four of the defendants, Luis Carlos De Leon Perez (De Leon), 41; Nervis Gerardo Villalobos Cardenas (Villalobos), 50; Cesar David Rincon Godoy
(Cesar Rincon), 50; and Rafael Ernesto Reiter Munoz (Reiter), 39, were arrested in Spain in October 2017 by Spanish authorities on arrest
warrants based on a 20-count indictment returned in the Southern District of Texas on Aug. 23, 2017. Cesar Rincon was extradited from Spain
on Feb. 9, and made his initial appearance today before U.S. Magistrate Judge MJ Stephen Smith of the Southern District of Texas. De Leon,
Villalobos and Reiter remain in Spanish custody pending extradition. A fifth defendant, Alejandro Isturiz Chiesa (Isturiz), 33, remains at large.
All five defendants are citizens of Venezuela; De Leon is also a U.S. citizen.

De Leon, Villalobos, Reiter and Isturiz are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. Cesar Rincon is charged
with two counts of conspiracy to commit money laundering. Each of the defendants is charged with one or more counts of money laundering,
as follows: De Leon, Cesar Rincon and Reiter, four counts each; Villalobos, one count; and Isturiz, five counts. De Leon and Villalobos are also
each charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA.

âCorruption threatens economic and political stability, and victimizes ordinary law-abiding people by diverting public funds into the pockets of
corrupt officials and bribe payers,â said Acting Assistant Attorney General Cronan. âThe charges announced today demonstrate our
commitment to fighting corruption at its source and to prosecuting those who allegedly launder their illicit gains through American financial
institutions and real estate. Through cases like this, we are sending a strong message to corrupt foreign officials: if you launder your ill-gotten
gains through the United States, you will be prosecuted.â

âEffective deterrence of corruption requires prosecution of culpable individuals, wherever those individuals are located,â said U.S. Attorney
Patrick. âWe will continue to enforce the FCPA against those that avail themselves of the privileges of the American marketplace.â

âThis case is an example of what can be accomplished when international law enforcement agencies work together to thwart complex cross-
border crimesâ said Special Agent in Charge Dawson. âHSI is committed to upholding the rule of law and investigating those that would
participate in illegal practices.

The indictment alleges that the five defendants, all of whom were then-current officials of PDVSA and its subsidiaries or former officials of other
Venezuelan government agencies or instrumentalities, were known as the âmanagement teamâ and wielded significant influence within PDVSA.
According to the indictment, the management team conspired with each other and others to solicit several PDVSA vendors, including vendors
who were residents of the United States, and who owned and controlled businesses incorporated and based in the United States, for bribes and
kickbacks in exchange for providing assistance to those vendors in connection with their PDVSA business. The indictment further alleges that
the co-conspirators then laundered the proceeds of the bribery scheme through a series of complex international financial transactions,
including to, from or through bank accounts in the United States, and, in some instances, laundered the bribe proceeds in the form of real
estate transactions and other investments in the United States.

According to the indictment, two PDVSA vendors, Roberto Enrique Rincon Fernandez (Roberto Rincon), 57, of The Woodlands, Texas, and
Abraham Jose Shiera Bastidas (Shiera), 54, of Coral Gables, Florida, sent over $27 million in bribe payments to an account in Switzerland for
which De Leon was a beneficial owner and De Leon and Villalobos were authorized signers. The indictment alleges that those funds were later
transferred to other accounts in Switzerland. Both Roberto Rincon and Shiera previously pleaded guilty in the Southern District of Texas to
FCPA charges in connection with a scheme to bribe PDVSA officials. According to admissions made in connection with their pleas, Roberto
Rincon and Shiera paid bribes and provided other things of value to PDVSA officials to ensure that their companies were placed on PDVSA
bidding panels and ensure that they were given payment priority so that they would get paid ahead of other PDVSA vendors with outstanding
invoices. Roberto Rincon and Shiera are currently awaiting sentencing.

An indictment is merely an allegation and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of
law.

With the unsealing of the indictment today, the Justice Department has announced charges against 15 individuals, 10 of whom have pleaded
guilty, as part of a larger, ongoing investigation by the U.S. government into bribery at PDVSA. HSI in Houston is conducting the ongoing
investigation with assistance from HSI in Boston and Madrid, as well as from Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation. Trial Attorneys
Jeremy R. Sanders and Sarah E. Edwards of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Deputy Chief John Pearson and Assistant U.S. Attorney
Robert S. Johnson of the Southern District of Texas are prosecuting the case. Assistant U.S. Attorney Kristine Rollinson of the Southern District
of Texas is handling the forfeiture aspects of the case.
The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs, the Swiss Federal Office of Justice and the Spanish Guardia Civil also provided assistance.

The Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice Departmentâs FCPA
enforcement efforts can be found at www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.

INDICTMENT
THE GRAND JURY CHARGES:
GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

At all relevant times, unless otherwise specified:

1. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (âFCPAâ), as amended,
Title 15, United States Code, Sections 78dd-1, et seg., was enacted by Congress for
the purpose of, among other things, making it unlawful to act corruptly in
furtherance of an offer, promise, authorization, or payment of money or anything

of value, directly or indirectly, to a foreign official for the purpose of obtaining or
STOR ETA Tae ieeiaarmt 7 Mad pe PW an OPO OP PP Dane OAT EO

o

retaining business for, or directing business to, any person.

2. Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (âPDVSAâ) was the Venezuelan state-
owned and state-controlled oil company. PDVSA and its subsidiaries and affiliates
were responsible for the exploration, production, refining, transportation, and trade
in energy resources in Venezuela and provided funding for other operations of the
Venezuelan government. PDVSA Services, Inc. was the U.S.-based affiliate of
PDVSA located in Houston, Texas, that, at various times, was responsible for
international purchasing on behalf of PDVSA. Bariven S.A. (âBarivenââ) was the
PDVSA procurement subsidiary responsible for equipment purchases. PDVSA
and its wholly owned subsidiaries, including PDVSA Services, Inc. and Bariven,
(hereinafter collectively referred to as âPDVSAââ) were âinstrumentalitiesâ of the
Venezuelan government as that term is used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States
Code, Section 78dd-2(h)(2)(A). PDVSA officers and employees were âforeign
officialsâ as that term is used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section
78dd-2(h)(2)(A).

3, PDVSA awarded contracts for energy services and equipment in a
number of ways, including through a competitive bidding process. One such
competitive bidding process began with a PDVSA purchasing analyst assembling a
bidding panel, which identified those companies that would be invited to submit

bids in connection for a particular project. PDVSA would then issue a request for

quotation to the companies included on the bidding panel and those companies
would in turn submit formal bids, from which a winner would be selected.
PDVSA also awarded sole source contracts, which were not subject to a
competitive bidding process. Ultimately, all contracts needed to be approved by
more senior PDVSA employees.

4. Beginning in at least 2011 and continuing until at least 2013, LUIS
CARLOS DE LEON PEREZ, NERVIS GERARDO VILLALOBOS
CARDENAS, CESAR DAVID RINCON GODOY, ALEJANDRO ISTURIZ
CHIESA, and RAFAEL ERNESTO REITER MUNOZ (collectively, the
âDefendantsâ described more fully below), solicited PDVSA vendors for bribes
and kickbacks in exchange for providing assistance to those vendors in connection
with their PDVSA business, including assisting them in obtaining PDVSA
contracts and assisting them in receiving payment priority over other vendors for
outstanding PDVSA invoices during the Venezuelan liquidity crisis.

5. The Defendants then laundered the proceeds of the bribery scheme
through numerous financial transactions, including through international wire
transfers to and from bank accounts that they opened in Switzerland, Curacao, and
elsewhere in the names of various companies.

6. The Defendants sought to conceal the nature of the scheme through

various complex financial transactions by directing bribe payments to be sent to
various recipients other than the intended PDVSA officials, including companies,
intermediaries, relatives, friends, creditors, and close personal associates of the
PDVSA officials.

The Defendants

7. Defendant LUIS CARLOS DE LEON PEREZ (âDE LEONâ) was
a dual citizen of the United States and Venezuela. DE LEON was thus a
âdomestic concernâ as that term is used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code,
Section 78dd-2(h)(1). DE LEON had previously been employed by
instrumentalities of the Venezuelan government, but was no longer so employed
during the relevant period.

(âVILLALOBOSâ), aka âEnano,â was a citizen of Venezuela. VILLALOBOS
had previously been employed by the Venezuelan government and
instrumentalities thereof, but was no longer so employed during the relevant
period.

9. Defendant CESAR DAVID RINCON GODOY (âCESAR

CESAR RINCON was employed by PDVSA and its subsidiaries, including
Bariven, in various capacities, including as the general manager of Bariven.

following, while in the Southern District of Texas and elsewhere:

42. DELEON, VILLALOBOS, CESAR RINCON, ISTURIZ, and
REITER promised Rincon, Shiera, and others known and unknown to the Grand
Jury assistance with getting paid on outstanding invoices on PDVSA contracts, as
well as assistance with winning new PDVSA contracts, in exchange for bribe

payments.
43. DELEON, VILLALOBOS, CESAR RINCON, and ISTURIZ

solicited assistance, and in turn Rincon, Shiera, and Swiss Banker 1, together with

12
others, assisted the PDVSA officials in opening bank accounts, including bank
accounts in Switzerland, for the PDVSA officials and their co-conspirators to
receive bribe payments.

44. DE LEON, VILLALOBOS, CESAR RINCON, ISTURIZ, and
REITER directed bribe payments to be sent to various recipients other than the
intended PDVSA officials, including companies, intermediaries, relatives, friends,
creditors, and close personal associates of the PDVSA officials, for the purpose of
concealing and disguising the nature, source, and ownership of the bribe payments.

45. DELEON and VILLALOBOS, together with others, engaged in
monetary transactions among their various accounts designed to conceal the nature,
source, and ownership of the proceeds of the specified unlawful activity.

46. Swiss Banker 1 and CESAR RINCON, each and together with
others, created false justifications for certain of the bribes, including invoices for
services that were never performed, for the purpose of concealing and disguising
the nature, source, and ownership of those bribe payments.

47. Rincon and Shiera, together with others, directed the wire transfer of,
and caused to be wired, bribe payments from bank accounts which were frequently
in the name of companies other than the companies being awarded PDVSA
contracts and receiving payments from PDVSA, for the purpose of concealing and

disguising the nature, source, and ownership of the bribe payments.

13
Acts In Furtherance of the Conspiracy

48. Beginning in at least 2010, Venezuela began to experience a liquidity
crisis as the profits earned through PDVSA, which historically had been a
significant source of revenue to the Venezuelan government as a result of its oil
reserves, were insufficient to meet the governmentâs expenses. Numerous analysts
began to speculate that PDVSA could default on its debt, and the government
made public commitments for PDVSA to increase oi! production.

49. Given these liquidity problems, PDVSA was unable to pay all of its
vendors in a timely manner, but remained under pressure to continue to escalate oil
production.

50. In or about 2011, Rincon and Shiera were approached by a group of
individuals who consisted of then-current PDVSA officials and individuals outside
PDVSA with influence at PDVSA, including DE LEON, VILLALOBOS, and
ISTURIZ, referred to as the âmanagement team.â The management team offered
to give Rinconâs and Shieraâs companies payment priority over other PDVSA
vendors, ensuring that Rinconâs and Shieraâs companies would get at least partial
payment on outstanding PDVSA invoices, and to provide Rinconâs and Shieraâs
companies with assistance in winning future PDVSA business, in exchange for
providing a bribe to the management team in the amount of 10% of all payments

Rincon and Shiera received from PDVSA. The management team made similar

14
offers to other vendors known and unknown to the Grand Jury. In addition,
individual members of the management team solicited additional bribe payments
from Rincon and Shiera.

51. DE LEON and VILLALOBOS explained that the bribe proceeds
would be split and would be shared among DE LEON, VILLALOBOS, CESAR
RINCON, ISTURIZ, REITER, OFFICIAL A, and OFFICIAL B.

52. Rincon and Shiera agreed to make the payments to the management
team in exchange for payment priority and assistance in winning future PDVSA
contracts.

53. Because they were able to guarantee payment through the corrupt
scheme, Rincon and Shiera continued to supply goods and services to PDVSA,
thereby enabling PDVSA to continue to do business with such vendors who might
not otherwise accept the risk of non-payment.

54. Payment allocation decisions for vendors were typically documented
by Bariven in weekly reports entitled, as translated into English, âProposal for
Payment to International Providers for the Procurement of Materials, Equipment,
and Food in Foreign Markets On Behalf of PDVSA and its Subsidiaries.â These
documents, generally referred to in shorthand (as translated into English) as the
payment proposals or proposals, typically contained a âPremiseâ stating, as

translated into English, âThe invoicing included in this payment schedule was

15
coordinated with the international offices of procurement (Houston and the
Netherlands) in line with the agreed upon payment conditions and the operational
needs coordinated between the hierarchic levels of Bariven and PDVSAâs
different businesses to ensure the delivery of materials and equipment in order to
safeguard the operational continuity of the Industry,â then set forth the debt and
proposed payments to selected vendors. The payment proposals were the subject
of extensive communications among the Defendants and their co-conspirators,
including discussions about how much would be allocated to and among Rinconâs
and Shieraâs companies and discussions about the bribe payments due to the
Defendants as a function of how much Rinconâs and Shieraâs companies were
receiving from PDVSA. CESAR RINCON and ISTURIZ had responsibility for
developing and approving the payment proposals, which were ultimately
authorized by Official A.
Account Set-Up

55. In order to facilitate the bribe payments and conceal their nature and
ownership, DE LEON and VILLALOBOS and their co-conspirators engaged
Swiss Company A to set up Swiss bank accounts into which bribe payments could
be received and to assist in providing justifications for the payments.

56. Ultimately, a number of accounts, in Switzerland and elsewhere, were

used in connection with the scheme. These accounts were used to funnel the bribes

16
from, to, and through multiple destinations before reaching their ultimate recipient.

57. âSwiss Account 1,â whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was a
Swiss bank account for which DE LEON was a beneficial owner and
VILLALOBOS and DE LEON were authorized signers. Swiss Account 1 was
used in connection with the scheme.

58. âSwiss Account 2,â whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was a
Swiss bank account. Swiss Account 2 was used in connection with the scheme.

59. âSwiss Account 3,â whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was a
Swiss bank account. Swiss Account 3 was used in connection with the scheme.

60. âSwiss Account 4,â whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was a
Swiss bank account. Swiss Account 4 was used in connection with the scheme.

61. âSwiss Account 5,â whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was a
Swiss bank account owned and controlled by Rincon and Shiera. Swiss Account 5
was used in connection with the scheme.

62. âSwiss Account 6,â whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was a
Swiss bank account owned and controlled by Shiera. Swiss Account 6 was used in
connection with the scheme.

63. âSwiss Account 7,â whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was a

Swiss bank account owned and controlled by ISTURIZ. Swiss Account 7 was

17
used in connection with the scheme.

64. âSwiss Account 8,â whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was a
Swiss bank account owned and controlled by CESAR RINCON. Swiss Account
8 was used in connection with the scheme.

65. âSwiss Account 9,â whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was a
Swiss bank account. Swiss Account 9 was used in connection with the scheme.

66. âCuracao Account 1,â whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was
a Curacaoan bank account. Curacao Account | was used in connection with the
scheme.

67. âU.S. Account 1,â whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was a
U.S. bank account. U.S. Account 1 was used in connection with the scheme.

68. Some of these accounts were not simply used to funnel bribe
payments, but also to provide false justifications for the payments themselves. For
example, on or about September 12, 2011, a letter and services agreement was
submitted through Swiss Company A to a Swiss bank in connection with the
request to open Swiss Account 1. The letter set forth a purported sub-contracting
arrangement between Swiss Account 5 and Swiss Account | in which Swiss
Account | was to assist Swiss Account 5 in providing services to Rincon Company
1. Similarly, on or about April 19, 2012, Swiss Accounts 2, 3, and 4 sent a letter to

Swiss Company A and Swiss Account | stating the general fund distribution from

18
Swiss Account | to Swiss Accounts 2, 3, and 4 and setting forth various services
purportedly provided by Swiss Accounts 2, 3, and 4 on behalf of Swiss Account 1
to Swiss Account 5 and Shiera Company 5.

69. The Defendants, Shiera, Rincon, and their co-conspirators
communicated, including via e-mail, phone, and various messaging applications,
about the account set-up and the need to submit documentation to justify the
payments. For example, on or about September 8, 2011, Shiera sent
VILLALOBOS a message using BlackBerry Messenger (âBBMââ) stating, as
translated into English, âThe institution has not accepted the stick. They are asking
me for invoices and purchase orders. I already submitted them. I hope it is
resolved tomorrow.â The conspirators frequently used the word âstickâ (as
translated into English) to refer to money.

70. The Defendants ultimately established a complex web of bank
accounts through which to conduct the financial transactions in connection with the
scheme and conceal the nature and ownership of the proceeds. On or about
September 16, 2011, Swiss Banker 1 wrote to Shiera, VILLALOBOS, and DE
LEON to report that Swiss Company A had set up four bank accounts â Swiss
Account 1, which Swiss Banker | referred to as the âmain account,â Swiss
Account 2, which Swiss Banker 1 identified as being for VILLALOBOS, Swiss

Account 3, which Swiss Banker 1 identified as being for DE LEON, and Swiss

19
Account 4, which Swiss Banker 1 identified as being for Official A. Swiss Banker
1 concluded the e-mail by stating, âWe will email you next week the new
account numbers and the wiring instructions to begin transfer of funds into the
main a/c ([Swiss Account 1]) for distribution into the 3 accounts.â

71. Swiss Company A, facilitated by Rincon and Shiera, also assisted the
Defendants in opening individual accounts in the names of various entities rather
than in the Defendantsâ own names. For example, on or about February 1, 2013,
CESAR RINCON sent Shiera an e-mail attaching his passport and utility bill.
Shiera then forwarded this information to Swiss Banker 1, who requested in
addition a copy of CESAR RINCONâs curriculum vitae. Swiss Banker | asked
Shiera, âShall I go ahead and order a new Nevis company for Cesar?â Shiera
replied to the e-mail, noting his agreement.

72. Onor about February 6, 2013, Swiss Banker 1 sent Shiera an e-mail
stating, âA new Nevis company called [Swiss Account 8] will be formed with
Cesar as the Director/BO/Shareholder.â

Payments to the Management Team and
Official Assistance to Rincon and Shiera

73. Rincon and Shiera made payments for the benefit of DE LEON,
VILLALOBOS, CESAR RINCON, ISTURIZ, and REITER using a variety of
bank accounts in the United States (including in the Southern District of Texas),

Switzerland, and Panama, to a variety of bank accounts, including, but not limited

20
to, the accounts referenced in Paragraphs 57 to 67 above.

74. For example, in total, accounts controlled by Rincon and Shiera
transferred over $27 million to Swiss Account 1, which transferred over $10
million to Swiss Account 2, over $16 million to Swiss Account 3, and over $1
million to Swiss Account 4, in connection with the scheme.

75. In exchange for these bribe and kickback payments, DE LEON,
VILLALOBOS, CESAR RINCON, ISTURIZ, and REITER provided
assistance to Rincon and Shiera in getting paid on outstanding PDVSA invoices
and obtaining new PDVSA contracts.

76. For example, on or about October 10, 2011, ISTURIZ sent Shiera a
BBM message stating, as translated into English, âI got for you and Pelon [Rincon]
[Rincon Company 4] 1.3mm [Rincon Company 2] 1.2mm and [Shiera Company 2]
6.9.â Shiera replied, as translated into English, âThat [Shiera Company 2] is his. I
need in [Shiera Company 1] and [Shiera Company 3]. Check it please.â

ISTURIZ later responded, as translated into English, âShit, bro, I had sent it
already! Let me see what I can do!â, to which Shiera replied, âChange it please.â
ISTURIZ responded, as translated into English, âPumita! [Shiera] Relax, let Piojo

[ISTURIZ] pamper you!â, to which Shiera replied, as translated into English, âIâm

21
in need of love $$$$$$ hahahaha.â

77. Consistent with ISTURIZâs BBM message, on or about October 17,
2011, PDVSA sent $6,980,000 to Shiera Company 2.

78. After several inter-company transfers, the funds referenced in
Paragraph 77 above were ultimately transferred to Rincon Company 2. On or
about October 26, 2011, Rincon Company 2 transferred $515,513.20 to Swiss
Account 1. Shortly thereafter, on or about November 2, 2011, Shiera Company 5
transferred $179,552.52 to Swiss Account 1. Then, on or about November 16,
2011, Swiss Account | transferred $100,000 to Swiss Account 2, $330,000 to
Swiss Account 3, and $215,000 to Swiss Account 4.

79. The Defendants frequently checked with Shiera and Rincon on the
status of the bribe payments. For example, on or about December 20, 2011,
VILLALOBOS sent Shiera a BBM message stating, as translated into English,
âdonât forget to talk with your administrator, it Is vital the flow comes in
December,â which the conspirators understood to refer to bribe payments. Shiera
responded, as translated into English, âHe just confirmed youâll have it before this
Friday.â

80. Onor about December 22, 2011, Shiera Company 5 made two

transfers to Swiss Account 1, one in the amount of $299,901.85 and another in the

22
amount of $362,485.68.

81. Rincon and Shiera frequently used DE LEON and VILLALOBOS as
intermediaries for communications with or about the PDVSA officials. For
example, on or about November 24, 2011, Shiera sent VILLALOBOS a BBM
message stating, as translated into English, âBrother, Piojo [ISTURIZ] never fails.
He put mine at like $3.5M on the proposal and 5 for the ones from Pelon [Rincon]
according to what we talked about at dinner. Give him support.â VILLALOBOS
responded, as translated into English, âThat guy is good.â

82. In addition to help getting paid on outstanding invoices, Rincon and
Shiera also asked the Defendants for their assistance in winning PDVSA contracts.
For example, on or about January 4, 2012, Shiera sent VILLALOBOS a BBM
message requesting VILLALOBOSâs assistance in securing a contract over a
competitor to supply equipment in relation to a PDVSA project.

83. On or about February 8, 2012, Shiera sent ISTURIZ a BBM message
asking, as translated into English, âWhatâs happened with the Motorgenerators?â
to which ISTURIZ replied, as translated into English, âCesar must sign it! [ll tell
him.â

84. The Defendants corresponded with Rincon and Shiera about PDVSA

bidding panels as well as the official actions the Defendants would take on behalf

of Rincon and Shiera. For example, on or about February 24, 2012, Shiera sent

23
ISTURIZ a BBM message with a proposed panel of bidders for an electric
equipment panel. ISTURIZ responded, as translated into English, âGood! Give
me the panels for the others!! Get people moving on that! Look, I have all the
purchasers from my office beating them hard,â to which Shiera replied, as
translated into English, âThat is my Piojo.â

85. In addition to allowing Rincon and Shiera to have input on PDVSA
bidding panels, as discussed in Paragraph 84 above, the Defendants gave Rincon
and Shiera inside information on upcoming PDVSA projects so that they could
choose the projects that their companies bid on. For example, on or about
February 28, 2012, ISTURIZ e-mailed Rincon and Shiera, stating, as translated
into English, âIâm sending you a list of the process that we need to start tomorrow.
Theyâre processes for the E&P [exploration and production] and Gas moments. I
started with e&p, because thatâs where the strength lies! I need to know before 10
am in which processes you want to get involved in and the panel.â

86. Onor about March 1, 2012, Rincon responded to the email from
ISTURIZ referenced in Paragraph 85 above, copying Shiera, stating, as translated
into English, âAttached you will find what we are going to work on highlighted in
YELLOW. These are drilling parts and equipment. There is one from Abraham.â

Attached was a highlighted list of equipment PDVSA sought to purchase with the

24
corresponding internal budgets.

87. The Defendants frequently sent Rincon and Shiera updates of the
money they expected to receive in bribes in exchange for the payments Rincon and
Shiera were receiving on outstanding PDVSA invoices as a result of the bribery
scheme. The Defendants occasionally sent Rincon and Shiera the payment
proposals themselves, either in draft form for input or in final form so Rincon and
Shiera could see how much money their companies were expected to receive (and,
in turn, how much they would need to pay in bribes). For example, on or about
January 5, 2012, ISTURIZ sent Rincon an e-mail stating, as translated into
English, âI need you to check these numbers. They are the payments for payment
proposal. The date that is on each payment corresponds to the Monday of the
week of the proposal. The date will not coincide with the one on which you
received the money, donât focus on that, just the amounts.â Attached was a
PDVSA payment proposal document setting forth vendors to be paid, (including a
number of Rinconâs companies) and the dates and amounts of the payments.

88. In addition, on or about May 17, 2013, CESAR RINCON sent
himself a PDVSA payment proposal from his PDVSA e-mail account to a personal
e-mail account. He forwarded it to VILLALOBOS, Shiera, and Rincon with the
message, as translated into English, âIâve attached the proposal reviewed and

approved by [Official A].â The attached payment proposal included payments to a

25
number of Shieraâs and Rinconâs companies, including Shiera Company 1, Shiera
Company 2, Shiera Company 3, Rincon Company 2, Rincon Company 5, and
Rincon Company 7.

89. The Defendants also frequently reminded Rincon and Shiera of how
much they owed in bribe payments, using coded or vague language to conceal
what they were talking about. For example, on or about March 15, 2012, DE
LEON sent Shiera a BBM message stating, as translated into English, âWere you
able to able to buy the things? Debt from the friends as of today $1,093,232,â
which the conspirators understood to be a reference to outstanding bribe payments.

90. Within a week of DE LEONâs message, accounts controlled by
Shiera and Rincon then made a series of transfers to Swiss Account 1, totaling just
over $1 million. On or about March 19, 2012, Swiss Account 5 transferred
$536,005.42 to Swiss Account 1. The next day, March 20, 2012, Shiera Company
5 transferred $281,781.34 to Swiss Account |. Finally, on or about March 22,
2012, Shiera Company 5 transferred $193,021.47 to Swiss Account 1.

91. In order to conceal the nature and ownership of the bribe proceeds,
ISTURIZ sent Rincon and Shiera instructions to pay various bank accounts, held
in the names of various companies. ISTURIZ made coded references to paying
bribes in exchange for future PDVSA business. For example, on or about March

22, 2012, ISTURIZ sent Rincon and Shiera an e-mail stating, as translated into

26
English, âHi P and P, Iâm sending you the coordinates in order for you to send me
something to buy coal to keep cooking the stew. ... We can use this account
while weâre opening the other one.â ISTURIZ concluded the e-mail with the
account and wire information for Curacao Account 1.

92. Onor about April 2, 2012, Rincon Company 2 transferred $450,000
from its bank account in the Southern District of Texas to Curacao Account 1.
Over the following several weeks, Curacao Account 1 made a series of transfers to
Swiss Account 7.

93. Onor about May 13, 2012, ISTURIZ sent Rincon and Shiera an e-
mail stating, as translated into English, âDear friends, Iâm sending you the
coordinates to move ahead somewhat on the payments while the other account is
being opened. I need to notify the friend at the bank before the money arrives.
Attached is a spreadsheet showing a summary of the payments over the past 3
weeks.â Set forth below was the account and wire information for Swiss Account
7. Attached was a chart setting forth various Rincon and Shiera companies, the
amounts they had been paid by PDVSA for a three-week period and two figures
representing bribe payments due in the amount of 10% and 2%.

94. On or about May 16, 2012, Rincon Company 2 transferred

$116,949.72 to Curacao Account |. Subsequently, Curagao Account 1 made two

27
transfers to Swiss Account 7.

95. Onor about June 1, 2012, Rincon Company 2 transferred $766,428.39
to Swiss Account 7.

96. Onor about June 18, 2012, ISTURIZ sent Rincon and Shiera an e-
mail stating, as translated into English, âDear colleagues, I am sending you the
Excel file with the summary of the payments and the great debt you have with
Paulo!â

97. Onor about June 19, 2012, Rincon responded to ISTURIZ, stating, as
translated into English, âTo date we have transferred the following amounts:
450,000 [Curacao Account 1], 116,949.72 [Curacao Account 1], 766,428.39
[Swiss Account 7], 367,069.19 [Swiss Account 7]. THE TOTAL IS...USD
1,700,447.30. Paulo, the problem is that sometimes we take the amount
considering the entire payment and sometimes we need to subtract 5% for our
alliesâ... Forgive the trouble but it is being deposited today and this way we have a
difference of USD 0000000000000000000000000000.00.â

98. On or about June 19, 2012, Rincon Company 2 transferred
$367,069.19 to Swiss Account 7.

99. Onor about June 21, 2012, Rincon Company 6 transferred $69,427.81
to Swiss Account 7.

100. Rincon frequently sent confirmations of bribe payments he had made

28
to the defendants. For example, on or about May 15, 2012, Rincon Company 2
transferred $200,000 to Swiss Account 9. The following day, Rincon sent the wire
confirmation to CESAR RINCON.

101. Similarly, on or about June 19, 2012, Rincon Company 2 transferred
$115,000 to Swiss Account 9. On or about June 21, 2012, Rincon forwarded the
wire confirmation to CESAR RINCON, who replied, as translated into English,
âAll good, Thanks.â

102. On several occasions, ISTURIZ referenced the fact that the financial
transactions through which he sought to receive bribe payments were designed to
conceal the nature and ownership of the proceeds. On or about July 12, 2012,
ISTURIZ forwarded account and wire information for U.S. Account 1 from
ISTURIZ Associate 1 to Rincon and Shiera, copying ISTURIZ Associate 1.
ISTURIZ stated, as translated into English, âI am sending the instructions in order
to start using this route. Copy to the person who is responsible for setting
everything up so that it is all really well shielded.â

103. On or about July 24, 2012, Shiera Company 6 transferred $323,045.27
to U.S. Account 1.

104. On or about July 31, 2012, Rincon Company 2 transferred $450,000
from its account in the Southern District of Texas to U.S. Account 1.

105. On or about August 1, 2012, Rincon Company 2 transferred

29
$533,729.77 from its account in the Southern District of Texas to U.S. Account 1.

106. On or about August 10, 2012, U.S. Account 1 transferred $445,785 to
Swiss Account 7.

107. On or about August 13, 2012, U.S. Account 1 transferred $625,056 to
Swiss Account 7.

108. On or about August 29, 2012, ISTURIZ sent Rincon and Shiera an e-
mail stating, as translated into English, âI am sending you the list up to this weekâs
proposal, which I am putting together. The numbers are going to stay like this!
Merry Christmas even though it isnât.â Attached were four charts â the first two
set forth various Rincon companies and various Shiera companies, along with the
amounts that each had been paid by PDVSA over the course of several weeks. The
second two, entitled âRRâ and âAS,â respectively, set forth various payment
amounts and payment destinations for bribe payments to ISTURIZ.

109. On or about November 30, 2012, Shiera sent DE LEON a BBM
message stating, as translated into English, âI have $20MM approved to collect for
this week. Iâd appreciate your help with at least one invoice for 15MM. Let me
know.â On the same day, DE LEON replied, âI'll help you with the payment.â

110. On or about February 19, 2013, Rincon Company 2 transferred

$200,000 to an account in the name of REITER Relative 1. Rincon sent the

30
payment confirmation to REITER by e-mail.

111. On or about February 21, 2013, Rincon Company 2 transferred
$250,000 to an account in the name of REITER Relative 1. Rincon sent the
payment confirmation to REITER by e-mail.

112. DE LEON and VILLALOBOS continued to act as intermediaries
between Rincon and Shiera and PDVSA officials. For example, on or about March
11, 2013, VILLALOBOS sent Shiera a BBM message stating, as translated into
English, âDid you get the second one for Nadal [REITER]? The one for 130?â
Shiera sent VILLALOBOS a BBM message stating, as translated into English,
âThe $130k transfer was returned to me, they say that the iban is wrong. Can you
ask for it again? This is Nadalâs [REITERâs].â, VILLALOBOS responded, as
translated into English, âYes that is it, Iâm going to ask for it.â

113. For example, in or about March 13, 2013, VILLALOBOS sent Shiera
a BBM message stating, as translated into English, âBrother, I met with Primo
[CESAR RINCON], I asked him to adjust the proposal with around 75 percent of
your invoice to convince [Official A] to sign it... .â

114. In addition, on or about May 3, 2013, VILLALOBOS sent Shiera a
BBM message stating, as translated into English, â[Official A] wrote to me, he said
he got a good ration this week.â

115. In order to disguise the nature and ownership of the bribe proceeds,

31
instead of having money sent directly to an account he controlled, REITER
frequently directed bribe money to third parties for his benefit. For example,
REITER directed that some of the money he was owed in connection with the
scheme be used to purchase a condominium in the name of a company controlled

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Thursday, April 19, 2018

Former Venezuelan Official Pleads Guilty to Money Laundering Charge in Connection with Bribery
Scheme

The former general manager of the procurement subsidiary of Venezuelaâs state-owned and state-controlled energy company, Petroleos de
Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA), pleaded guilty today for his role in an international money laundering scheme involving bribes paid by the owners of
U.S.-based companies to Venezuelan government officials to corruptly secure energy contracts and payment priority on outstanding invoices.

Acting Assistant Attorney General John P. Cronan of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Ryan K. Patrick of the Southern
District of Texas and Special Agent in Charge Mark Dawson of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcementâs Homeland Security Investigationsâ
(ICE-HSI) Houston Field Office made the announcement.

Cesar David Rincon Godoy (Cesar Rincon), 50, a citizen of Venezuela previously residing in Spain, pleaded guilty today in federal court in
Houston to one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. U.S. District Judge Kenneth M. Hoyt of the Southern District of Texas
accepted Cesar Rinconâs plea and imposed a personal money judgment in the amount of $7,033,504.71 against the defendant, who agreed to
the entry of an order of forfeiture. Sentencing is scheduled for July 9.

Cesar Rincon was arrested in Spain in October 2017 and subsequently extradited to the United States after a federal grand jury in the Southern
District of Texas returned a 20-count indictment against him and Luis Carlos De Leon Perez (De Leon), 41; Nervis Gerardo Villalobos Cardenas
(Villalobos), 50; Alejandro Isturiz Chiesa (Isturiz), 33; and Rafael Ernesto Reiter Munoz (Reiter), 39. According to admissions made in connection
with Cesar Rinconâs plea, between January 2012 and June 2013, he conspired with De Leon, Villalobos, Isturiz, Reiter and others, all of whom
were then-current officials of PDVSA and its subsidiaries or former officials of other Venezuelan government agencies or instrumentalities, to
solicit PDVSA vendors for bribes and kickbacks in exchange for providing assistance to those vendors in connection with their PDVSA business.
Specifically, Cesar Rincon admitted that he accepted bribes from Roberto Enrique Rincon Fernandez (Roberto Rincon), 57, of The Woodlands,
Texas, and Abraham Jose Shiera Bastidas (Shiera), 54, of Coral Gables, Florida, in exchange for taking official acts in his capacity as general
manager of PDVSAâs procurement subsidiary in order to assist Roberto Rinconâs and Shieraâs companies, including their U.S.-based companies,
in receiving payment priority and receiving additional PDVSA contracts. Cesar Rincon further admitted that he then conspired with Roberto
Rincon and Shiera to launder and conceal the proceeds of the bribery scheme through a series of financial transactions, including wire transfers
to accounts in the United States and Switzerland held in the names of individuals or entities other than Cesar Rincon. Both Roberto Rincon and
Shiera previously pleaded guilty in the Southern District of Texas to charges under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) for their respective
roles in the bribery scheme. They currently await sentencing.

As part of his plea agreement, Cesar Rincon also admitted to soliciting and receiving bribes from other owners of energy companies based in
the United States in exchange for his assistance in helping those individuals and their companies win business with PDVSA and obtain payment
from PDVSA on outstanding invoices ahead of other PDVSA vendors. In total, Cesar Rincon admitted to conspiring with others to launder at
least $7,033,504.71 in proceeds from the various bribery schemes in which he participated.

The charges against De Leon, Villalobos, Isturiz and Reiter remain pending. Each of the four remaining defendants is charged with one count of
conspiracy to commit money laundering and with one or more counts of money laundering. De Leon and Villalobos are also each charged with
one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA. De Leon was extradited from Spain on March 9, and was ordered detained pending trial following a
detention hearing held on April 10, before U.S. Magistrate Judge Frances H. Stacy of the Southern District of Texas. Villalobos and Reiter remain
in Spanish custody pending extradition and Isturiz remains at large.

The charges contained in the indictment are merely accusations, and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a
reasonable doubt in a court of law.

Cesar Rincon becomes the latest individual to plead guilty as part of a larger, ongoing investigation by the U.S. government into bribery at
PDVSA. Including Cesar Rincon, Roberto Rincon, and Shiera, the Justice Department has announced the guilty pleas of a total of 1lindividuals in
connection with the investigation.

ICE-HSI in Houston is conducting the ongoing investigation with assistance from ICE-HSI in Boston and Madrid, as well as from IRS Criminal
Investigation. Trial Attorneys Jeremy R. Sanders, Sarah E. Edwards and John-Alex Romano of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Deputy
Chief John Pearson and Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert S. Johnson of the Southern District of Texas are prosecuting the case. Assistant U.S.
Attorney Kristine Rollinson of the Southern District of Texas is handling the forfeiture aspects of the case.

The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs, the Swiss Federal Office of Justice and the Spanish Guardia Civil have provided substantial
assistance.

The Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice Departmentâs FCPA
enforcement efforts can be found at www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.

THE UNITED STATES CHARGES:
Introduction

At all times material to this Information:

1. Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (âPDVSAâ) was the Venezuelan state-
owned and state-controlled oil company. PDVSA and its subsidiaries were
responsible for the exploration, production, refining, transportation, and trade in
energy resources in Venezuela and provided funding for other operations of the
Venezuelan government. Bariven S.A. (âBarivenâ) was the PDVSA procurement
subsidiary responsible for equipment purchases. PDVSA and its wholly owned
subsidiaries, including Bariven, were âinstrumentalitiesâ of the Venezuelan
government as that term is used in the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (ââFCPAâ),
Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2(h)(2)(A). PDVSA officers and
employees were âforeign officialsâ as that term is used in the FCPA, Title 15,

United States Code, Section 78dd-2(h)(2)(A).
2. At all relevant times, Defendant CHARLES QUINTARD BEECH
Ill (âDefendant BEECHâ) was a U.S. citizen and a resident of Texas, and
controlled, together with others, a number of closely-held companies, including
two companies based in the Southern District of Texas, that BEECH used to
secure contracts with PDVSA. BEECH was thus a âdomestic concernâ and an
officer, director, employee, agent, and shareholder of a âdomestic concernâ as
those terms are used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-
2(h)(1).

3. At all relevant times, Alfonzo Eliezer GRAVINA Munoz
(âGRAVINAâ), a resident of the Southern District of Texas, was employed by
PDVSA or a wholly owned subsidiary thereof, including as a purchasing manager.
GRAVINAâs job responsibilities included selecting companies for bidding panels,
which allowed those companies to submit bids on individual PDVSA projects.
GRAVINA, who has been charged separately, was a âforeign officialâ as that term
is used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2(h)(2)(A).

4, âOfficial G,â an individual whose identity is known to the United
States, was at all relevant times working for PDVSA or a wholly owned subsidiary
thereof, including as a senior executive for Bariven. Official Gâs job
responsibilities included exercising authority over or managing the purchasing and

2
procurement process for Bariven. Official G was a âforeign officialâ as that term

is used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2(h)(2)(A).

Southern District of Texas and elsewhere, at least one of the following overt acts,

Two Businessmen Plead Guilty to Foreign Bribery Charges in Connection with Venezuela Bribery
Schemes

A former general manager and partial owner of a Florida-based energy company and an owner of multiple Texas-based energy companies each
pleaded guilty today to foreign bribery charges for their roles in a scheme to corruptly secure contracts from Venezuelaâs state-owned and
state-controlled energy company, Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA).

Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Kenneth Magidson of the Southern
District of Texas, Special Agent in Charge Mark Dawson of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcementâs Homeland Security Investigations (ICE-
HSI) in Houston and Special Agent in Charge Richard Goss of Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigationâs (IRS-Cl) Houston Field Office
made the announcement.

Juan Jose Hernandez Comerma (Hernandez), 51, of Weston, Florida, pleaded guilty in federal court in Houston to one count of conspiracy to
violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and one count of violating the FCPA. Charles Quintard Beech Ill, 46, of Katy, Texas, pleaded
guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA. U.S. District Judge Gray H. Miller of the Southern District of Texas accepted the guilty
pleas. Sentencing for both defendants is scheduled for July 14, 2017.

According to admissions made in connection with Hernandezâs plea, Hernandez conspired with U.S.-based businessmen Abraham Jose Shiera
Bastidas (Shiera) and Roberto Enrique Rincon Fernandez (Rincon) to pay bribes and other things of value to PDVSA purchasing analysts. This
ensured that Shieraâs and Rinconâs companies were placed on PDVSA bidding panels, which enabled the companies to win lucrative energy
contracts with PDVSA. From 2008 until 2012, Hernandez admitted that, while general manager and later partial owner of one of Shieraâs
companies, he provided recreational travel and entertainment and offered bribes to PDVSA officials, including Alfonzo Eliezer Gravina Munoz
(Gravina), based on a percentage of contracts the officials helped to award to Shieraâs companies. Rincon, Shiera and Gravina have all also
pleaded guilty in the case.

According to admissions made in connection with Beechâs plea, from 2011 to 2012, Beech paid bribes to multiple PDVSA officials, including
Gravina, in exchange for their assistance in placing Beechâs companies on PDVSA bidding panels and assisting Beechâs company or companies
in receiving payment for previously awarded PDVSA contracts. Beech also admitted that he agreed with others, including PDVSA officials, to
engage in financial transactions to conceal the nature, source and ownership of the bribe proceeds.

In addition to Hernandez and Beech, the Justice Department has announced the guilty pleas of six other individuals as part of a larger, ongoing
investigation by the U.S. government into bribery at PDVSA.

ICE-HSI is conducting the ongoing investigation with assistance from the FBI and IRS-Cl. Trial Attorneys Aisling OâShea and Jeremy R. Sanders of
the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys (AUSA) John Pearson and Robert S. Johnson of the Southern District of Texas
are prosecuting the case. AUSAs Kristine Rollinson and Vincent Carroll of the Southern District of Texas are handling the forfeiture aspects of
the case.

The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs and the Swiss Federal Office of Justice also provided assistance.

The Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice Departmentâs FCPA

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Wednesday, December 16, 2020

Former Venezuelan National Treasurer and Her Spouse Charged in Connection with International
Bribery and Money Laundering Scheme

A former Venezuelan National Treasurer and her spouse were charged in a superseding indictment filed Tuesday for their alleged participation
in a previously indicted billion-dollar currency exchange and money laundering scheme. An alleged co-conspirator was previously charged in
the original indictment.

Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian C. Rabbitt of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Ariana Fajardo Orshan of the
Southern District of Florida, Special Agent in Charge Anthony Salisbury of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcementâs Homeland Security
Investigations (HSI) Miami Field Office, Special Agent in Charge Mark B. Dawson of HSI Houston Field Office, Acting Special Agent in Charge
David Magdvcz of HSI Boston Field Office, Special Agent in Charge George L. Piro of the FBI Miami Field Office, and Inspector General Jay N.
Lerner of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Office of Inspector General (OIG) made the announcement.

Claudia Patricia Diaz Guillen (Diaz), 47, and her spouse, Adrian Jose Velasquez Figueroa (Velasquez), 41, Venezuelan citizens who reside in
Madrid, Spain, were charged in a superseding indictment filed in the Southern District of Florida with one count of conspiracy to commit money
laundering and two counts of money laundering.

Raul Gorrin Belisario (Gorrin), 52, a Venezuelan billionaire businessman who owns Globovision news network, was charged by indictment in
August 2018 and remains charged in the superseding indictment as a co-conspirator in the same money laundering conspiracy and money
laundering counts. He is currently a fugitive residing in Venezuela.

The superseding indictment alleges that Gorrin paid millions of dollars in bribes to two former Venezuelan national treasurers, Alejandro
Andrade Cedeno (Andrade) and Diaz, and to Velasquez, for the benefit of Diaz, to corruptly secure the rights to conduct foreign currency
exchange transactions for the Venezuelan government at favorable rates. Gorrin wired money to and for the benefit of Andrade and Diaz,
including money for private jets, yachts, homes, champion horses, high-end watches, and a fashion line.

Andrade, 56, a Venezuelan citizen, was previously sentenced to 10 years in prison in November 2018 for his role in the conspiracy to commit
money laundering. As part of his guilty plea, Andrade admitted that he received over $1 billion in bribes from co-conspirator Gorrin and other
co-conspirators in exchange for using his position as Venezuelan national treasurer to select them to conduct currency exchange transactions at
favorable rates for the Venezuelan government.

An indictment is merely an allegation and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.

HSI Miami, HS! Houston, HS! Boston, FBI Miami, and the FDIC OIG are investigating this case. This case is being prosecuted by Assistant Chief
Vanessa Sisti and Trial Attorney Paul A. Hayden of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section, and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Kurt Lunkenheimer and

Nalina Sombuntham of the Southern District of Florida. The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs provided significant assistance in
this matter. The Policia Nacional (Spanish National Police) also provided significant assistance.

The Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice

Departmentâs FCPA enforcement efforts can be found at www. justice. gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.

The United States Attorney charges:

COUNT ONE
(Conspiracy to Violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act)

| Overview

1. From in or about November 2009, up to and including in
or about April 2011, COLIN STEVEN, the defendant, engaged in an
international conspiracy to bribe an official of the Kingdom of
Saudi Arabia (the âSaudi Arabia Officialâ) in connection with
the $93 million sale of jets from STEVENâs employer, Embraer
S.A. (âEmbraerâ), to a company located 1n Saudi Arabia (the
âSaudi Arabia Companyâ). As part of the schemÃ©, STEVEN caused
approximately $1.5 million in bribe payments to be made by
Embraer to the Saudi Arabia Official through an intermediary
company located in South Africa (the âSouth Africa Companyâ) .
In exchange for those payments, the Saudi Arabia Official

provided more favorable terms to Embraer in a sale of jets to

the Saudi Arabia Company. As a further part of the scheme,

1 JUDGE NATHAN

STEVEN arranged to and did receive a kickback from a portion of
the bribe proceeds.
Relevant Persons and Entities

2. At all times relevant to this Information, Embraer was
an aircraft manufacturer based in Brazil, with operations and
subsidiaries in various locations around the world, including
the United States and the Middle East. Embraer manufactured
commercial, executive, and defense aircraft for governmental: and
private customers throughout the world. Embraerâs American
depositary shares were listed and traded on the New York Stock
Exchange, and Embraer was required to file periodic reports with
the Securities and Exchange Commission under Section 15(d) of
the Securities Exchange Act, Title 15, United States Code,
Section 780(d). Accordingly, Embraer was an issuer within the
meaning of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (âFCPAâ), Title 15,
United States Code, Sections 78dd-1 and 78m. Embraer
Representations LLC (âEmbraer RLâ) was a subsidiary wholly owned
by Embraer and incorporated in Delaware. Embraer RL maintained
a bank account in Manhattan, New York.

3. At all times relevant to this Information, COLIN
STEVEN, the defendant, was a British national. Until December
2013, STEVEN was an executive in Embraerâs Executive Jets
Division and had responsibility for overseeing the generation of
sales in regions that included the Middle East. Accordingly,

2

 
Case i:1?7-cr-00788-A.N Bocument2 -Fied Tsfeii? Page Sof 24

STEVEN was an âemployeeâ and âagentâ of an issuer within the
meaning of the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-
1.

4. The Saudi Arabia Company was the state-owned and
state-controlled national oil company of Saudi Arabia, and
performed a function that Saudi Arabia treated as its own.
Accordingly, the Saudi Arabia Company was an âinstrumentalityâ
of a foreign government within the meaning of the FCPA, Title
15, United States Code, Section 78dd-1(f) (1). The Saudi Arabia
Official was a high-level official at the Saudi Arabia Company
who had influence over aircraft purchasing decisions.

5. The South Africa Company was an industrial valve and
pump manufacturer partially owned by friends of COLIN STEVEN,.
the defendant. As of the time of the events described in this
Information, the South Africa Company had no experience in the
aircraft industry or in Saudi Arabia.

The FCPA Bribery Scheme

 

6. From in or about November 2009 through in or about
April 2011, COLIN STEVEN, with others, agreed to pay, and caused
and aided and abetted Embraerâs actual payment of, approximately
$1.5 million in bribes to the Saudi Arabia Official in order to
obtain a contract between the Saudi Arabia Company and Embraer
for the sale of three business jets, valued at approximately $93

million.

 
at

7. %In his capacity as an executive with Embraerâs
Executive Jets Division, COLIN STEVEN, the defendant, oversaw
staff who were responsible for selling new and used Embraer
aircraft. Both Embraerâs revenue and employeesâ sales
commissions, including for STEVEN and the sales agents he
supervised, were significantly higher for sales of new aircraft
compared to used aircraft.

8. In or about 2006, COLIN STEVEN, the defendant, and
others at Embraer learned that the Saudi Arabia Company was
interested in purchasing aircraft. Thereafter, and until in or
about the fall of 2009, STEVEN and a salesperson who reported to
him had occasional contact with employees of the Saudi Arabia
Company, and periodically discussed the potential sale of
Embraer aircraft. During that period, STEVEN learned that the
Saudi Arabia Company was interested in purchasing used aircraft.

9. In or about late 2009, COLIN STEVEN, the defendant,
met with the Saudi Arabia Official in London, England. The
Saudi Arabia Official offered to help Embraer win the aircraft
contract from the Saudi Arabia Company, and to change the deal
from used jets to new jets if Embraer paid the Saudi Arabia
Official. STEVEN knew that the Saudi Arabia Official was a
high-level official at the Saudi Arabia Company and believed

that the Saudi Arabia Official could deliver on the promise.

10. Over the course of multiple discussions in London,
England, and with the approval of his supervisor (âEmbraer
Executive Aâ), COLIN STEVEN, the defendant, and the Saudi Arabia
Official agreed on a per-aircraft payment of $550,000 to be paid
to the Saudi Arabia Official, for a total bribe amount of $1.65
million.

Til. On or about December 10, 2009, COLIN STEVEN, the
defendant, sent an email to Embraer Executive A and another
Embraer executive (âEmbraer Executive Bâ), in which STEVEN
wrote, in part, that the Saudi Arabia Official âhas budget [ed]
for used [aircraft] only and will have to lobby for more funds
to take new [aircraft] over used.â Defendant STEVEN added,
â[t]here is more to come to replace the entire fleet they have
with [Embraer model] 170,s [sic] [Saudi Arabia Official] sees.
this as long term.â Embraer Executive A approved offering a
per-aircraft payment of $550,000 to the Saudi Arabia Official.

12. In or about late 2009 and early 2010, COLIN STEVEN,
the defendant, developed a plan to use the South Africa Company
as a purported agent on the transaction with the Saudi Arabia
Company. As a result, Embraer would pay $1.65 million in
âfinders feesâ to the South Africa Company. In truth and in
fact, the South Africa Company would perform no work on the
transaction and would be used to facilitate and to disguise the
payment to the Saudi Arabia Official.

5

 
Case :i?-cr-00788-A.N Bocument2 Filed Tgfeia? Page 6 of 24

13. Between in or about late 2009 and in or about early
2010, COLIN STEVEN, the defendant, had a telephone conversation
with an executive at Embraer (âEmbraer Executive Câ), in which
STEVEN described the planned bribery scheme and the plan to use
the South Africa Company as the entity that would pass the
payments to the Saudi Arabia Official. Embraer Executive C
reassured STEVEN that South Africa Company could be trusted to
pass on the money to the Saudi Arabia Official.

14. In or about early 2010, acting on the Saudi Arabia
Officialâs recommendation, a committee at the Saudi Arabia
Company approved the Saudi Arabia Companyâs purchase of three
new aircraft from Embraer for $93 million.

15. On or about March 5, 2010, Embraer RL executed an
agreement with the South Africa Company, pursuant to which the
South Africa Company would purportedly âpromote sales of ....
aircraft manufactured by Embraer . . . solely and specifically
toâ a subsidiary of the Saudi Arabia Company. In reality, the
South Africa Company provided no services to Embraer other than
serving as a conduit to funnel payments to the Saudi Arabia
Official. The agreement did not disclose that the payments were
ultimately bound for the Saudi Arabia Official.

16. Less than two weeks later, on or about March 15, 2010,
Embraer and a U.S.-based subsidiary of the Saudi Arabia Company

entered into an aircraft purchase agreement, pursuant to which

6

 
Case i:1?7-cr-00788-A.N Bocument2 Filed lafeia? Page 7 of 24

the subsidiary agreed to purchase three new aircraft for
approximately $93 million. The aircraft were delivered in or
around November and December 2010.

17. In or about December 2010, the South Africa Company
submitted three invoices to Embraer, each in the amount of
$550,000, for its purported commission, even though it had not
rendered any services to Embraer in connection with the sale.
Executives at Embraer approved paying the invoices. The
payments were made through two wire transfers from Embraer RLâs
bank account in Manhattan, New York, to the South Africa
Companyâs bank account in South Africa: $550,000 on or about
December 22, 2010, and $1.1 million on or about February 18,
2011.

18. Between on or about February 2, 2011, and on or about
April 5, 2011, the South Africa Company made three wire
transfers totaling $1,434,100 to bank accounts in Switzerland
and Bahrain held by an individual who was acting as an
intermediary for the Saudi Arabia Official (âIntermediary Aâ).
Intermediary A kept a portion of the funds and transferred the

remainder to the Saudi Arabia Official.

The Kickback Scheme

19. As set forth below, COLIN STEVEN, the defendant,
caused a portion of the fraudulent payment that Embraer RL made
to the South Africa Company to be paid to STEVEN as a kickback.
In total, STEVEN received approximately $129,935 in kickbacks.

20. In or about late 2009 and early 2010, while COLIN
STEVEN, the defendant, with others, was arranging to pay the
Saudi Arabia Official, STEVEN also developed a plan to take a
portion of the money as a kickback. STEVEN discussed this plan
with Embraer Executive C, and the two agreed that STEVEN,
Embraer Executive C, and the South Africa Company would each
take a portion of the $1.65 million to be paid by Embraer RL.

21. At the direction of COLIN STEVEN, the defendant, and
unbeknownst to Embraer, the South Africa Company transferred to
STEVENâs United States bank account $129,935 of the $1.65
million it had received from Embraer RL: $97,465 on or about
October 21, 2011, and $32,470 on or about December 1, 2011.
Those wire transfers passed through a bank in Manhattan, New
York.

22. COLIN STEVEN, the defendant, and Embraer Executive C,
who had recently been promoted within the company, subsequently
had a telephone conversation in which Embraer Executive C

informed STEVEN that Embraer Executive C no longer wanted his

 
Pg

Case i:1?7-cr-00788-A.N Bocument2 Filed Tgfeii? Page @ of 24

share of the money. As a result, STEVEN kept all of the
$129,935 he received from the South Africa Company.

23. In or about March 2010 and November 2010, Embraer paid
COLIN STEVEN, the defendant, a total of $44,000 in commissions
based on the sale of the three new aircraft to Saudi Arabia
Company.

24. On or about December 19, 2014, COLIN STEVEN, the
defendant, was interviewed by an agent of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (âFBIâ). During that interview, when asked about
one of the wire transfers he received from the South Africa
Company in 2011, STEVEN falsely stated that the funds had been
transferred to him by an executive of the South Africa Company
for the purpose of buying real estate in connection with a
potential business venture between STEVEN and the executive.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Thursday, December 21, 2017

Former Embraer Sales Executive Pleads Guilty to Foreign Bribery and Related Charges

A former sales executive of Embraer S.A. (Embraer), a Brazilian-based manufacturer of aircraft, pleaded guilty today in connection with a
scheme to pay bribes to a high-level foreign government official in exchange for assistance in securing Embraerâs sale of aircraft to Saudi
Arabiaâs national oil company.

Acting Assistant Attorney General John P. Cronan of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, Acting U.S. Attorney Joon H. Kim of the Southern
District of New York, Assistant Director Stephen E. Richardson of the FBIâs Criminal Investigative Division and Special Agent in Charge Robert F.
Lasky of the FBIâs Miami Field Office made the announcement.

Colin Steven, 61, a U.K. citizen residing in the United Arab Emirates, was charged by information filed today in the Southern District of New York
with one count of violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA, one count of wire fraud, one
count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, one count of money laundering, one count of conspiracy to launder money and one count of making a
false statement. Steven pleaded guilty to all of those counts before U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan of the Southern District of New York. A
sentencing date has not been scheduled yet. The Court set a control date of June 21, 2018.

As part of his plea, Steven, a former vice president of sales & marketing in Embraerâs Executive Jets Division, admitted that he engaged ina
scheme to have Embraer pay bribes to a foreign official in exchange for assistance in getting an aircraft sales contract with favorable terms
awarded to Embraer; retained a kickback as part of the scheme; and lied to law enforcement officials about his kickback.

Steven consented to the filing of the information, which alleged that Embraer was in negotiations with Saudi Arabiaâs national oil company over
a potential aircraft sale when Steven and the foreign official devised an arrangement whereby the foreign official would guarantee that Embraer
would win a contract and that the contract would involve new rather than used aircraft in exchange for approximately $1.5 million in bribe
payments. In early 2010, Saudi Arabiaâs national oil company awarded Embraer a contract for three new aircraft, valued at approximately $93
million. The information further alleged that he arranged to disguise the bribes as commissions to a South African company that was owned in
part by Steven's personal friends. The South African company transferred the bulk of the bribe proceeds to the foreign officialâs intermediary
but, at Stevenâs direction, paid a portion of the bribe proceeds to Steven.

In pleading guilty, Steven admitted that he executed, and conspired with others to execute, the bribery and kickback schemes; laundered and
conspired to launder the proceeds of those schemes through the South African company and lied to U.S. law enforcement about the kickback.

The guilty plea entered today follows the execution in October 2016 of a deferred prosecution agreement between the Department and
Embraer, under which Embraer agreed to pay a $107 million penalty to the Department as part of a $205 million global resolution to
investigations by the Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission and Brazilian authorities related to corrupt conduct in several
countries, including Saudi Arabia. The agreement acknowledged Embraerâs cooperation with the investigations. With the cooperation of U.S.
authorities, Brazilian authorities have charged 11 individuals for their alleged involvement in Embraerâs misconduct in the Dominican Republic.
Saudi Arabian authorities have charged two individuals for their alleged involvement in Embraerâs misconduct in Saudi Arabia.

The FBI's International Corruption Squads, based in Miami, Florida, and Los Angeles, California, investigated the case. Trial Attorneys John-Alex
Romano and Nikhila Raj and Assistant Chief David Johnson of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Cooper
of the Southern District of New York, are prosecuting the case. The Fraud Section appreciates the cooperation and assistance provided by the
SEC in this matter.

The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs provided significant assistance in this matter. The Department also appreciates the
cooperation and assistance provided by authorities in Brazil, the Dominican Republic, South Africa and Switzerland in this matter.

In 2015, the FBI formed International Corruption Squads across the country to address national and international implications of foreign
corruption.

The Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice Departmentâs FCPA

enforcement efforts can be found at www. justice. gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.

for Iraq Official 1Â°s agreement to help steer contract awards to Intermediary

51. On or about May 26, 2010, CC-2 attended a meeting in Perth,
Australia with employees of Company 8 and Company 9 in which they agreed to
enter into a corrupt bid-rigging process. At the meeting, CC-2 agreed with certain
employees of Company 8 and Company 9 that CC-2 would act as a go-between to
share information between Company 8 and Company 9, so that Company 8 and
Company 9 could adjust their bids to ensure that Company 8 won Iraq Project 1A
and Company 9 won Iraq Project 1B. As part of the agreement, Company 8 and
Company 9 also agreed to retain certain subsidiaries and affiliates of Intermediary
Company as sub-contractors on the projects. Certain executives at Company 8 and
Company 9 ensured that Intermediary Companyâs subsidiary and affiliated
companies would be paid so that Intermediary Company had sufficient funds to
make bribe payments to Iraqi government officials.

52. Onor about October 23, 2010, the government of Iraq awarded Iraq

including certain executives and employees at Company 8 and Company 9, agreed
to pay approximately $8.25 million to CC-7, portions of which they understood
would be paid as bribes to Iraq Official 2, Iraq Official 3, and Iraq Official 4 in

Kazakhstan

55. In Kazakhstan, Defendants C. AHSANI and S. AHSANI conspired
with others, including certain executives and employees at client companies of
Intermediary Company, to pay bribes, promise to pay bribes, offer to pay bribes,
and authorize the payment of bribes to foreign government officials, including at
SOE-3 and SOE-4, in order to obtain improper business advantages and to obtain
and retain business for Intermediary Company and its co-conspirator client
companies, including, but not limited to, Company 3, Company 4, Company 6,

20
Case 4:19-cr-00147 Documentis Filed on 03/04/19 in TXSD Page 21 of 56

21. Defendants C. AHSANI and 8S. AHSANI also conspired with others to engage
in other corrupt conduct, such as bid-rigging, paying kickbacks, and laundering of
the proceeds of the corrupt schemes.

56. For example, by at least in or around 2001, Defendant C. AHSANI
and others learned that the government of Kazakhstan would be seeking bids for
various sub-projects on âKazakhstan Project 1.â At the time, Defendant
C. AHSAN] also learned that SOE-3 had appointed a consortium of large oil and
gas services companies to assist with the bidding. Defendant C. AHSANI and
others knew that SOE-4, as the operator of the project, evaluated bids made by the
oil and gas companies and that SOE-4 made recommendations to SOE-3 for final
approval of certain significant contract awards.

57. In or around 2002, Company 3 retained Intermediary Company for
work in Kazakhstan. In or before October 2002, Defendant C. AHSANI and
others identified for certain Company 3 executives and employees âKazakhstan
Project 1A,â a sub-project to Kazakhstan Project I that is known to the United
States and Defendants, as a viable project for Company 3. In order to win that
project, Defendant C. AHSANI conspired with others, including CC-2 and certain
Company 3 executives, to bribe government officials in Kazakhstan in order to win

âKazakhstan Project 1A.â

21
Case 4:19-cr-00147 Documentis Filed on 03/04/19 in TXSD Page 22 of 56

58. Specifically, on or about December 31, 2004, Defendant C. AHSANI
promised to pay approximately $1.6 million to âKazakh Official 1,â a high-level
executive at SOE-4 whose identity is known to the United States and the
Defendants, in return for Kazakh Official 1âs assistance with helping to award
Kazakhstan Project 1A to Company 3. Although the promise to pay bribes
occurred while Kazakh Official 1 worked for SOE-4, Intermediary Company did
not make any payments to Kazakh Official 1 until Kazakh Official 1 stopped
working for SOE-4; Defendant C. AHSANI did, however, arrange for the
purchase of an automobile and furniture for Kazakh Official 1 while Kazakh
Official 1 was still employed by SOE-4. Thereafter, in or about and between
February 2005 and October 2006, Defendant C. AHSANI and others caused
Intermediary Company to make payments to a company they knew was
beneficially owned and controlled by Kazakh Official 1, as had been promised, in
return for Kazakh Official 1âs prior assistance in securing Kazakhstan Project 1A
for Company 3.

59. Defendant C. AHSANI also conspired with others to bribe certain
officials at SOE-3 to ensure that Company 3 won Kazakhstan Project 1A. For
example, on or about June 17, 2003, Intermediary Company entered into a sub-
agency agreement with a âsub-agentâ company, in which Intermediary Company

agreed to pay the âsub-agentâ approximately 0.44% of the value of the Kazakhstan

22
Case 4:19-cr-00147 Documentis Filed on 03/04/19 in TXSD Page 23 0f 56

Project 1A contract award. At the same time, Defendant C. AHSANI caused
Intermediary Company to enter into a âside letterâ agreement with the âsub-agentâ
providing that payments to the âsub-agentâ would only continue if three specific
government officials in Kazakhstan remained in their positions in the government.
Defendant C. AHSANI and others executed this âside letterâ because they
understood that portions of Intermediary Companyâs payments to the âsub-agentâ
would be used to pay bribes to these three government officials in Kazakhstan.

60. Defendant C. AHSANI further conspired with others to make bribe
payments, including payments of cash and a vehicle, to âKazakh Official 2,â a
high-ranking official at SOE-3 whose identity is known to the United States and
Defendants, in exchange for Kazakh Official 2âs agreement to use Kazakh Official
2âs authority within SOE-3 to authorize the award of Kazakhstan Project 1A to
Company 3.

61. On or about May 26, 2004, the government of Kazakhstan awarded
Kazakhstan Project 1A to Company 3.

62. In addition to the above, Defendant C. AHSANT, and at times
Defendant S. AHSANI, and others, acting within the scope of their agency and
other agreements and for the benefit of Intermediary Company and Intermediary
Companyâs client companies, conspired with others, including certain client

company executives and employees, to pay bribes, promise to pay bribes, offer to

23
Case 4:19-cr-00147 Documentis Filed on 03/04/19 in TXSD Page 24 of 56

pay bribes, and authorize the payment of bribes to at least five foreign government
officials in Kazakhstan, including within SOE-3 and SOE-4, in order to obtain the
following additional projects:

a. In or around and between 2003 and 2009, and in conspiracy
with certain executives and employees at SBM, at least one sub-contract to
Kazakhstan Project 1 for SBM and a joint venture partner;

b. In or around and between 2003 and 2010, and in conspiracy
with certain executives and employees at Company 7, at least seven sub-projects to
Kazakhstan Project 1 and at least one other oil and gas project for Company 7.
Among other things, Defendants C. AHSANI, S. AHSANI, and others also
undertook affirmative steps to conceal the bribes paid and promised to be paid on
behalf of Company 7, which included Defendant S. AHSANI coordinating with a
high-ranking executive at Company 7 to maintain a double set of books and
records to disguise Intermediary Companyâs bribery payments on behalf of
Company 7 as legitimate transactions;

c. In or around and between 2004 and 2006, and in conspiracy
with certain executives and employees at Company 6, at least one sub-project to

Kazakhstan Project 1 for Company 6;

24
Case 4:19-cr-00147 Documentis Filed on 03/04/19 in TXSD Page 25 of 56

d. In or around and between 2004 and 2010, and in conspiracy
with certain executives and employees at Rolls-Royce and Company 21, at least
one sub-project to Kazakhstan Project 1 for Rolls-Royce and Company 21;

â¬. In or around 2005, and in conspiracy with certain executives
and employees at Company 4, at least one sub-project to Kazakhstan Project 1 for

with certain executives and employees at Company 3, at least two additional sub-
projects to Kazakhstan Project 1 for Company 3;

with certain executives and employees at Company 13, at least two sub-projects to
Kazakhstan Project 1 for Company 13;

h. In or around and between 2005 and 2010, and in conspiracy
with certain executives and employees at Company 14, at least eight contracts in
connection with a major oil and gas project in Kazakhstan for Company 14. In
furtherance of the conspiracy, Defendants C. AHSANI and S. AHSANI agreed
amongst themselves and with others, including CC-6, to pay kickbacks to an
executive at one of the companies in the Company 14 partnership;

i. In or around and between 2006 and 2009, and in conspiracy

with certain executives and employees at Company 19, at least one sub-project to

with certain executives and employees at Company 20, at least three sub-projects
to Kazakhstan Project 1 for Company 20. In furtherance of the corrupt conspiracy,
Defendants C. AHSANI, S. AHSANI, and others paid kickbacks to an executive
at Company 20.
Algeria

63. In Algeria, Defendants C. AHSANI and S. AHSANI conspired with
others, including certain executives and employees at client companies of
Intermediary Company, to pay bribes, promise to pay bribes, offer to pay bribes,
and authorize the payment of bribes to foreign government officials, including at
SOE-S, in order to obtain improper business advantages and to obtain and retain
business for Intermediary Company and its co-conspirator client companies,
including, but not limited to, Company 2, Company 15, Company 16, and
Company 18. Defendants C. AHSANI and S. AHSANT also conspired with others
to engage in other corrupt conduct such as bid-rigging, paying kickbacks, and
laundering the proceeds of the corrupt schemes.

64. For example, beginning by at least in or around November 2010,

executives at Company 2 contacted executives of Intermediary Company about

26
Case 4:19-cr-00147 Documentis Filed on 03/04/19 in TXSD Page 27 of 56

assistance for work in Algeria. In or about early 2011, Defendant C. AHSANI
received a âpanickedâ phone call from a Company 2 executive who said that the
Company 2 executive had promised to pay one or more individuals who had
assisted Company 2 in obtaining a contract from SOE-5. The Company 2
executive told Defendant C. AHSANI that Company 2 needed to make this
payment, and that if the payment were not made, Company 2 would have
âproblemsâ with the SOE-5 contract. The Company 2 executive asked Defendant
C. AHSANT if Intermediary Company would agree to make the payment on behalf
of Company 2. Defendant C. AHSANI believed that the Company 2 executive
was asking him to pay a bribe.

65. In or around June 2011, Defendants C. AHSANI, S. AHSANT, and
others caused Intermediary Company to enter into a âSales Consultant Agreementâ
with Company 2. As part of the arrangement, Defendant C. AHSANI agreed with
others, including two executives of Company 2, that Company 2 would pay
$300,000 to Intermediary Company, and that Intermediary Company would
perform no services for Company 2, except that Intermediary Company would pass
on a portion of the $300,000 payment to a shell company that had itself performed
no work for Intermediary Company or Company 2.

27
Case 4:19-cr-00147 Documentis Filed on 03/04/19 in TXSD Page 28 of 56

States, on to an Intermediary Company bank account in Monaco. In or about and
between October 25, 2012 and December 31, 2012, Defendants C. AHSANI and
S. AHSANI caused Intermediary Company to transfer approximately $170,000
from an Intermediary Company bank account in the United Arab Emirates, through
a correspondent account in the United States, on to the shell company bank
account in the United Kingdom.

67. In addition to the above, Defendants C. AHSANI, S. AHSANI, and
others, acting within the scope of their agency and other agreements and for the
benefit of Intermediary Company and Intermediary Companyâs client companies,
conspired with others, including certain client company executives and employees,
to pay bribes, promise to pay bribes, offer to pay bribes, and authorize the payment
of bribes to government officials in Algeria, including within SOE-5, in order to
obtain the following additional projects:

a. In or around 2008, and in conspiracy with certain executives
and employees at Company 15, Company 16, and Company 17, in order to win
certain projects for Company 15 and Company 16. Among other things,
Defendants C. AHSANI, S. AHSANT, and others, conspired with executives at
Company 15, Company 16, and Company 17 to rig the bid on the two projects to
ensure that Company 15 won one project and that Company 16 won the other. In

furtherance of this agreement, Defendants C. AHSANI, S. AHSANTI, and others,

28
Case 4:19-cr-00147 Documentis Filed on 03/04/19 in TXSD Page 29 of 56

paid Company 17 to compensate Company 17 for deliberately losing the bid; and
paid kickbacks to an executive of Company 15 and paid kickbacks to a consultant
for Company 17; and
b. In or around and between 2009 and 2014, and in conspiracy
with certain executives and employees of Company 18, in order to obtain certain
contracts supplying spare parts to SOE-5 for Company 18. In furtherance of this
and other schemes, Defendants C. AHSANI, 8S. AHSANI, and others paid
kickbacks to an executive of Company 18.
Libya

68. In Libya, Defendants C. AHSANI and S. AHSANI, conspired with
others, including certain executives and employees at client companies of
Intermediary Company, to pay bribes, promise to pay bribes, offer to pay bribes,
and authorize the payment of bribes to foreign government officials in Libya,
including at SOE-6, in order to obtain improper business advantages and to obtain
and retain business for Intermediary Company and its co-conspirator client
companies, including, but not limited to, Company 10, Company 11, Company 12,
Company 23, and Company 24. Defendants C. AHSANI and S. AHSANT also
conspired with others to engage in other corrupt conduct such as paying kickbacks
to executives and laundering the proceeds of the corrupt bribery and kickback

schemes.

29
Case 4:19-cr-00147 Documentis Filed on 03/04/19 in TXSD Page 30 of 56

69. For example, in or around May 2006, Company 10 entered into an
âAgency Agreementâ appointing Intermediary Company as its agent in attempting
to secure the award of âLibya Project 1,â a design and construction project that is
known to the United States and Defendants. Thereafter, Defendant S. AHSANI
conspired with others, including CC-5, to promise to pay âLibya Official 1,â an
individual whose identity is known to the United States and the Defendants, in
exchange for Libya Official 1âs agreement to assist Intermediary Company and
Company 10 in obtaining the contract award for Libya Project 1. While Defendant
S. AHSANI, CC-5, and others understood that Libya Official 1 was not an
appointed Libyan government official at the time they promised to pay Libya
Official 1, Defendant S. AHSANI, CC-5, and others, believed Libya Official 1
could exert influence over senior Libyan government officials, including one
official who was a close relative of the then-head of the Libyan government, and
that this senior Libya officialâs support or lack of support could determine whether
Company 10 and its subsidiaries won the award for Libya Project 1. At the time,
Defendants C. AHSANI and 8. AHSANI also agreed to pay the bribe because
they understood that Libya Official 1 could potentially use Libya Official 1âs
influence to steer other Libyan government contracts to Intermediary Company

and its co-conspirator clients.

30
Case 4:19-cr-00147 Documentis Filed on 03/04/19 in TXSD Page SL of $6

70. In or around October 2006, the Libyan government awarded Libya
Project 1 to Company 10.

71. After Libya Project 1 was awarded to Company 10, and in furtherance
of the corrupt arrangement, Defendants C. AHSANI, S. AHSANI, and others paid
$250,000 to a shell company they believed to be held in the name of a relative of
Libya Official 1, who by this time had an official title in the Libyan government.

72. Later, in or around 2009, Company 10 and Intermediary Company
had a contract dispute, which led Company 10 to stop making contractual
payments. In order to induce Company 10 to continue their payments to
Intermediary Company, Defendants C. AHSANI and 8S. AHSANI agreed to pay
two executives at Company 10 kickbacks valued at approximately $100,000 each.

73.  Inaddition to the above, Defendants C. AHSANI and S. AHSANI,
acting within the scope of their agency and other agreements and for the benefit of
Intermediary Company and Intermediary Companyâs client companies, conspired
with others, including certain client company executives and employees, to pay
bribes, promise to pay bribes, offer to pay bribes, and authorize the payment of
bribes to government officials in Libya, including at SOE-6, in order to obtain the

following additional projects:

31
Case 4:10-cr-00147 Documentis Filed on 03/04/19 in TXSD Page 32 of 56

a. In or around and between 2008 and 2011, and in conspiracy
with certain executives at Company 23 and Company 24, at least one project for
Company 23 and Company 24;

b. In or around and between 2009 and 2010, and in conspiracy
with certain executives and employees at Company 12, at least one project for
Company 12. In furtherance of the corrupt conspiracy, Defendants C. AHSANI
and S. AHSANI, and others, paid kickbacks to an executive at Company 12; and

c. In or around 2010, and in conspiracy with certain executives
and employees at Company 11, at least one project for Company 11.

Concealment and Obstruction

74. Beginning in or around 2006 and continuing until in or around 2016,
Defendants C. AHSANI and S. AHSANI conspired with others to conceal the
ongoing bribery and money laundering schemes on behalf of Intermediary
Company and its co-conspirator client companies. Among other things,
Defendants C. AHSANI, S. AHSANI, and others used code words when
communicating with others about the corrupt scheme, made false statements over
international wires to the United States to obtain necessary compliance
certifications, caused false statements to be made in official proceedings, and took
efforts to conceal the discovery of incriminating information by law enforcement

in the United States and elsewhere.

32
Case 4:19-cr-00147 Documentis Filed on 03/04/19 in TXSD Page 33 of 56

75. For example, Defendants C. AHSANI and S. AHSANI conspired
with others to make false statements, through interstate and international wire
communications, to âDue Diligence Organization,â an anti-bribery organization
headquartered in the United States whose identity is known to the United States
and the Defendants. Due Diligence Organization offered companies due diligence
services, including screenings and certifications, which were designed to signal
whether a company had met certain anticorruption standards.

76. Beginning in or around 2006, Rolls-Royceâs compliance department
initiated a new control that required all sales agents to undergo Due Diligence
Organizationâs screening and obtain a compliance certification. In order to obtain
Due Diligence Organizationâs certification and continue doing business with Rolls-
Royce and RRESI, Defendants C. AHSANI, S. AHSANI, and others agreed to
cause materially false and misleading information to be transmitted, through
interstate and international wire, to Due Diligence Organization in the United
States, including false statements that Intermediary Company was not involved in
the payment of bribes to foreign government officials. Further, Defendants
C. AHSANI, S. AHSANI, and others provided Due Diligence Organization with
business references, including executives at Company 3, Company 7, and
Company 18, who knew that Intermediary Company paid bribes to win business

for Company 3, Company 7, and Company 18, respectively. Defendants

33
Case 4:19-cr-00147 Documentis Filed on 03/04/19 in TXSD Page 34 of 56

C. AHSANI, S. AHSANI, and others caused Intermediary Company to submit
false statements so that Intermediary Company could continue to maintain Due
Diligence Organizationâs certifications until at least in or around 2015.
| 77. Additionally, in or around June and July of 2011, Defendant

C. AHSANL S. AHSANI and others learned that a foreign law enforcement
agency had begun investigating a co-conspirator. In response, Defendants

C. AHSANI, S. AHSANI, and others caused over 250,000 potentially
incriminating emails and other documents on Intermediary Companyâs system to
be archived. Thereafter, Defendants C. AHSANI, S. AHSANI, and others caused
the archived documents to be relocated from Intermediary Companyâs offices in
Monaco to Lebanon and the United Arab Emirates.

78. On or about March 29, 2016, several media outlets began reporting
that Defendants C. AHSANI, S. AHSANI, and others had participated in a long-
running bribery scheme at Intermediary Company, and the news reports included
excerpts from the archived documents identified in Paragraph 77. The Defendants
learned that multiple law enforcement agencies, including law enforcement in the
United States, were conducting investigations into Intermediary Companyâs
bribery scheme. Thereafter, in or around the summer of 2016, Defendants

C. AHSANI, S. AHSANI, and others destroyed incriminating documents with the

34
Case 4:10-cr-00147 Documentis Filed on 03/04/19 in TXSD Page 35 of 56

intent to prevent their discovery by law enforcement agents in the United States,
the United Kingdom, Australia, and elsewhere.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Wednesday, October 30, 2019

Oil Executives Plead Guilty for Roles in Bribery Scheme Involving Foreign Officials

The former CEO and chief operations officer (COO) of a Monaco-based intermediary company have pleaded guilty for their roles in a scheme to
corruptly facilitate millions of dollars in bribe payments to officials in multiple countries. These included Algeria, Angola, Azerbaijan, the
Democratic Republic of Congo, Iran, Irag, Kazakhstan, Libya and Syria. The companyâs former business development director also pleaded guilty
for his role in paying bribes in Libya.

Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Ryan K. Patrick of the Southern
District of Texas, Assistant Director in Charge Timothy R. Slater of the FBIâs Washington Field Office, Inspector in Charge Adrian Gonzales of the
U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) Houston Division and Special Agent in Charge D. Richard Goss of the IRS-Criminal Investigationâs (IRS-Cl)
Houston Field Office made the announcement.

Cyrus Ahsani, 51, and Saman Ahsani, 46, both of United Kingdom (UK), each pleaded guilty March 25 to one count of conspiracy to violate the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), for conspiring to facilitate bribes on behalf of companies in foreign countries in order to secure oil and gas
contracts. UK resident Steven Hunter, 50, former business development director, pleaded guilty Aug. 2, 2018, to one count of conspiracy to
violate the FCPA. Cyrus and Saman Ahsani are set for sentencing April 20, 2020, before U.S. District Judge Vanessa Gilmore of the Southern
District of Texas. Hunterâs sentencing is scheduled for March 13, 2020, before U.S. District Judge David Hittner.

According to court documents, former U.S. resident and CEO Cyrus Ahsani and former COO Saman Ahsani managed a Monaco-based
intermediary company that provided services for multinational companies operating in the energy sector. From approximately 1999 to 2016,
the Ahsanis conspired with others, including multiple companies and individuals, to make millions of dollars in bribe payments to government
officials in Algeria, Angola, Azerbaijan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Iran, Irag, Kazakhstan, Libya and Syria.

Additionally, court documents reflect Cyrus and Saman Ahsani laundered the proceeds of their bribery scheme in order to promote and conceal
the schemes and to cause the destruction of evidence in order to obstruct investigations in the United States and elsewhere. Hunter
participated in the conspiracy to violate the FCPA by, among other things, facilitating bribe payments to Libyan officials between about 2009
and 2015.

The FBI, IRS-Criminal Investigation and U.S. Postal Inspection Service conducted the investigation. Trial Attorneys Dennis R. Kihm, Gerald M.
Moody Jr., Jonathan P. Robell and Gwendolyn A. Stamper of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Suzanne Elmilady
of the Southern District of Texas are prosecuting the case. The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs also provided substantial
assistance in this matter.

The governments of Australia, Canada, France, Guernsey, Italy, Monaco, the Netherlands, Portugal, Switzerland and UK provided significant
assistance in this matter as did the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Eurojust.

The Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice Departmentâs FCPA

SUPERSEDING INDICTMENT
THE GRAND JURY CHARGES:
GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

At all relevant times, unless otherwise specified:

1. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (âFCPAâ), as amended,
Title 15, United States Code, Sections 78dd-1, et seg., was enacted by Congress for
the purpose of, among other things, making it unlawful to act corruptly in
furtherance of an offer, promise, authorization, or payment of money or anything
of value, directly or indirectly, to a foreign official for the purpose of obtaining or
retaining business for, or directing business to, any person.

2. Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (ââPDVSAââ) was the Venezuelan state-
owned and state-controlled oil company. PDVSA and its subsidiaries and affiliates

were responsible for the exploration, production, refining, transportation, and trade
 

in energy resources in Venezuela and provided funding for other operations of the
Venezuelan government. PDVSA Services, Inc. was the U.S.-based affiliate of
PDVSA located in Houston, Texas, that, at various times, was responsible for
international purchasing on behalf of PDVSA. Bariven S.A. (âBarivenââ) was the
PDVSA procurement subsidiary responsible for equipment purchases. PDVSA
and its wholly owned subsidiaries, including PDVSA Services, Inc. and Bariven,
(hereinafter collectively referred to as âPDVSAâ) were âinstrumentalitiesâ of the
Venezuelan government as that term is used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States
Code, Section 78dd-2(h)(2)(A). PDVSA officers and employees were âforeign
officialsâ as that term is used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section
78dd-2(h)(2)(A).

3. PDVSA awarded contracts for energy services and equipment in a
number of ways, including through a competitive bidding process. One such
competitive bidding process began with a PDVSA purchasing analyst assembling a
bidding panel, which identified those companies that would be invited to submit
bids in connection for a particular project. PDVSA would then issue a request for
quotation to the companies included on the bidding panel and those companies
would in turn submit formal bids, from which a winner would be selected.

PDVSA also awarded sole source contracts, which were not subject to a
 

competitive bidding process. Ultimately, all contracts needed to be approved by
more senior PDVSA employees.

4. Beginning in at least 2011 and continuing until at least 2013,
NERVIS GERARDO VILLALOBOS CARDENAS, ALEJANDRO ISTURIZ
CHIESA, RAFAEL ERNESTO REITER MUNOZ, JAVIER ALVARADO
OCHOA, Luis Carlos De Leon Perez, and Cesar David Rincon Godoy
(collectively, the âPDVSA Defendantsâ), solicited PDVSA vendors for bribes and
kickbacks in exchange for providing assistance to those vendors in connection with
their PDVSA business, including assisting them in obtaining PDVSA contracts and
assisting them in receiving payment priority over other vendors for outstanding
PDVSA invoices during the Venezuelan liquidity crisis.

5. The PDVSA Defendants, with the assistance of DAISY TERESA
RAFOI BLEULER and PAULO JORGE DA COSTA CASQUEIRO MURTA
(collectively with the PDVSA Defendants the âDefendants,â described more fully
below), then laundered the proceeds of the bribery scheme through numerous
financial transactions, including through international wire transfers to and from
bank accounts that they opened in Switzerland, Curacao, Dubai, and elsewhere in
the names of various companies.

6. The Defendants sought to conceal the nature of the scheme through

various complex financial transactions by directing bribe payments to be sent to
various recipients other than the intended PDVSA Defendants, including
companies, intermediaries, relatives, friends, creditors, and close personal
associates of the PDVSA Defendants.

__as though fully set forth herein.
49. From in or around 2011 and continuing until at least 2013, in the
Southern District of Texas and elsewhere, the defendants,
NERVIS GERARDO VILLALOBOS CARDENAS
ALEJANDRO ISTURIZ CHIESA
RAFAEL ERNESTO REITER MUNOZ
JAVIER ALVARADO OCHOA

and
DAISY TERESA RAFOI BLEULER,

did knowingly conspire, confederate, and agree with each other, De Leon, Cesar
Rincon, and others known and unknown to the Grand Jury to commit offenses

under Title 18, United States Code, Section 1956, namely:

12

 
a. knowing that the property involved in a financial transaction represented
the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity, to conduct or attempt to
conduct such a financial transaction which in fact represented the
proceeds of specified unlawful activity, knowing that the transaction is
designed in whole and in part to conceal and disguise the nature, the
location, the source, the ownership, and the control of the proceeds of
specified unlawful activity, namely, bribery of a foreign official, a felony
violation of the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Sections 78dd-2 and
78dd-3, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section
1956(a)(1)(B); and

b. with the intent to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity,
namely, bribery of a foreign official, a felony violation of the FCPA,
Title 15, United States Code, Sections 78dd-2 and 78dd-3, transport,
transmit, or transfer funds from a place in the United States to a place
outside the United States, in violation of Title 18, United States Code,
Section 1956(a)(2)(A).

Manner and Means of the Conspiracy
50. The manner and means by which VILLALOBOS, ISTURIZ,

REITER, ALVARADO, RAFOT, De Leon, Cesar Rincon, and their co-

13
conspirators sought to accomplish the purpose of the conspiracy included, among
other things, the following, while in the Southern District of Texas and elsewhere:

51. The PDVSA Defendants promised Rincon, Shiera, and others known
and unknown to the Grand Jury assistance with getting paid on outstanding
invoices on PDVSA contracts, as well as assistance with winning new PDVSA
contracts, in exchange for bribe payments.

52. VILLALOBOS, ISTURIZ, ALVARADO, De Leon, and Cesar
Rincon solicited assistance, and in turn Rincon, Shiera, and RAFOI, together with
others, assisted the PDVSA Defendants in opening bank accounts, including bank
accounts in Switzerland, for the PDVSA Defendants and their co-conspirators to
receive bribe payments.

53. The PDVSA Defendants directed bribe payments to be sent to various
recipients other than the intended PDVSA Defendants, including companies,
intermediaries, relatives, friends, creditors, and close personal associates of the
PDVSA Defendants, for the purpose of concealing and disguising the nature,
source, and ownership of the bribe payments.

54. De Leon and VILLALOBOS, together with others, participated in
meetings in the United States with Rincon and Shiera to discuss the bribe

payments.

14
55. DeLeon, VILLALOBOS, and ALVARADO, together with others,
engaged in monetary transactions among their various accounts designed to
conceal the nature, source, and ownership of the proceeds of the specified unlawful
activity.

56. RAFOI and Cesar Rincon, each and together with others, created
false justifications for certain of the bribes, including invoices for services that
were never performed, for the purpose of concealing and disguising the nature,
source, and ownership of those bribe payments.

57. Rincon and Shiera, together with others, directed the wire transfer of,
and caused to be wired, bribe payments from bank accounts which were frequently
in the name of companies other than the companies being awarded PDVSA
contracts and receiving payments from PDVSA, for the purpose of concealing and
disguising the nature, source, and ownership of the bribe payments.

Acts In Furtherance of the Conspiracy

58. Beginning in at least 2010, Venezuela began to experience a liquidity
crisis as the profits earned through PDVSA, which historically had been a
significant source of revenue to the Venezuelan government as a result of its oil
reserves, were insufficient to meet the governmentâs expenses. Numerous analysts
began to speculate that PDVSA could default on its debt, and the government

made public commitments for PDVSA to increase oil production.

15
59. Given these liquidity problems, PDVSA was unable to pay all of its
vendors in a timely manner, but remained under pressure to continue to escalate oil
production.

60. In or about 2011, Rincon and Shiera were approached by De Leon and
VILLALOBOS, who were acting on behalf of the PDVSA Defendants. Rincon
and Shiera also referred to the PDVSA Defendants as the âmanagement team.â
The PDVSA Defendants offered to give Rinconâs and Shieraâs companies payment
priority over other PDVSA vendors, ensuring that Rinconâs and Shieraâs
companies would get at least partial payment on outstanding PDVSA invoices, and
to provide Rinconâs and Shieraâs companies with assistance in winning future
PDVSA business, in exchange for providing a bribe to the PDVSA Defendants in
the amount of 10% of all payments Rincon and Shiera received from PDVSA. The
PDVSA Defendants made similar offers to other vendors known and unknown to
the Grand Jury. In addition, individual PDVSA Defendants, including ISTURIZ,
REITER, and Cesar Rincon solicited additional bribe payments from Rincon and
Shiera.

61. DeLeon and VILLALOBOS explained that the bribe proceeds would
be split and would be shared among VILLALOBOS, ISTURIZ, REITER,

ALVARADO, De Leon, Cesar Rincon, and Official B.

16

Pryahe Pra oa are)

62. Rincon and Shiera agreed to make the payments to the PDVSA
Defendants in exchange for payment priority and assistance in winning future
PDVSA contracts.

63. Because they were able to guarantee payment through the corrupt
scheme, Rincon and Shiera continued to supply goods and services to PDVSA,
thereby enabling PDVSA to continue to do business with such vendors who might
not otherwise accept the risk of non-payment.

64. Payment allocation decisions for vendors were typically documented
by Bariven in weekly reports entitled, as translated into English, âProposal for
Payment to International Providers for the Procurement of Materials, Equipment,
and Food in Foreign Markets On Behalf of PDVSA and its Subsidiaries.â These
documents, generally referred to in shorthand, as translated into English, as the
payment proposals or proposals, typically contained a âPremiseâ stating, as
translated into English, âThe invoicing included in this payment schedule was
coordinated with the international offices of procurement (Houston and the
Netherlands) in line with the agreed upon payment conditions and the operational
needs coordinated between the hierarchic levels of Bariven and PDVSAâs
different businesses to ensure the delivery of materials and equipment in order to
safeguard the operational continuity of the Industry,â and then set forth the debt

and proposed payments to selected vendors. The payment proposals were the

17
POP Oana 12 Af FR
MSD Page is of 75

subject of extensive communications among the PDVSA Defendants and their co-
conspirators, including discussions about how much would be allocated to and
among Rinconâs and Shieraâs companies and discussions about the bribe payments
due to the PDVSA Defendants as a function of how much Rinconâs and Shieraâs
companies were receiving from PDVSA. Cesar Rincon and ISTURIZ had
responsibility for developing and approving the payment proposals, which were
ultimately authorized by ALVARADO.

Account Set-Up

65. In order to facilitate the bribe payments and conceal their nature and
ownership, Shiera introduced De Leon and VILLALOBOS to RAFOI and Swiss
Company A for the purpose of setting up Swiss bank accounts into which bribe
payments could be received and to assist in providing justifications for the
payments.

66. RAFOT assisted with setting up accounts for De Leon,
VILLALOBOS, Cesar Rincon, and ALVARADO.

67. Ultimately, a number of accounts, in Switzerland and elsewhere, were
used in connection with the scheme. These accounts were used to funnel the bribes
from, to, and through multiple destinations before reaching their ultimate recipient.

68. âSwiss Account 1,â whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was a

Swiss bank account for which De Leon was a beneficial owner and

18
VILLALOBOS and De Leon were authorized signers. Swiss Account 1 was used
in connection with the scheme.

69. âSwiss Account 2,â whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was a
Swiss bank account controlled by VILLALOBOS. Swiss Account 2 was used in
connection with the scheme.

70. âSwiss Account 3,â whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was a
Swiss bank account controlled by De Leon. Swiss Account 3 was used in
connection with the scheme.

71. âSwiss Account 4,â whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was a
Swiss bank account controlled by ALVARADO, for which ALVARADO Relative
1 was the listed beneficial owner. Swiss Account 4 was used in connection with
the scheme.

72. âSwiss Account 5,â whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was a
Swiss bank account owned and controlled by Rincon and Shiera. Swiss Account 5
was used in connection with the scheme.

73. âSwiss Account 6,â whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was a
Swiss bank account owned and controlled by Shiera. Swiss Account 6 was used in

connection with the scheme.

19

A PTC AP OF FO

74. âSwiss Account 7,â whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was a
Swiss bank account owned and controlled by ISTURIZ. Swiss Account 7 was
used in connection with the scheme.

75. âSwiss Account 8,â whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was a
Swiss bank account owned and controlled by Cesar Rincon. Swiss Account 8 was
used in connection with the scheme.

76. âSwiss Account 9,â whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was a
Swiss bank account. Swiss Account 9 was used in connection with the scheme.

77. âCuracao Account 1,â whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was
a Curacaoan bank account. Curacao Account 1 was used in connection with the
scheme.

78. âU.S. Account 1,â whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was a
U.S. bank account. U.S. Account 1 was used in connection with the scheme.

79. Some of these accounts were not simply used to funnel bribe
payments, but also to provide false justifications for the payments themselves. For
example, on or about September 12, 2011, a letter and services agreement was
submitted through Swiss Company A to a Swiss bank in connection with the
request to open Swiss Account 1. The letter set forth a purported sub-contracting
arrangement between Swiss Account 5 and Swiss Account 1 in which Swiss

Account 1 was to assist Swiss Account 5 in providing services to Rincon Company

20

 
 

1. Similarly, on or about April 19, 2012, Swiss Accounts 2, 3, and 4 sent a letter to
Swiss Company A and Swiss Account | stating the general fund distribution from
Swiss Account 1 to Swiss Accounts 2, 3, and 4 and setting forth various services
purportedly provided by Swiss Accounts 2, 3, and 4 on behalf of Swiss Account 1
to Swiss Account 5 and Shiera Company 5.

80. RAFOLI the PDVSA Defendants, Shiera, Rincon, and their co-
conspirators communicated, including via e-mail, phone, and various messaging
applications, about the account set-up and the need to submit documentation to
justify the payments. For example, on or about September 8, 2011, Shiera sent
VILLALOBOS a message using BlackBerry Messenger (âBBMâ) stating, as
translated into English, âThe institution has not accepted the stick. They are asking
me for invoices and purchase orders. I already submitted them. I hope it is
resolved tomorrow.â The conspirators frequently used the word âstickâ (as
translated into English) to refer to money.

81. The Defendants ultimately established a complex web of bank
accounts through which to conduct the financial transactions in connection with the
scheme and conceal the nature and ownership of the proceeds. On or about
September 16, 2011, RAFOI wrote to Shiera, VILLALOBOS, and De Leon to
report that Swiss Company A had set up four bank accounts â Swiss Account 1,

which RAFOI referred to as the âmain account,â Swiss Account 2, which RAFOI

21
identified as being for VILLALOBOS, Swiss Account 3, which RAFOI identified
as being for De Leon, and Swiss Account 4, which RAFOI identified as being for
ALVARADO. RAFOI concluded the e-mail by stating, âWe will email you next
week the new account numbers and the wiring instructions to begin transfer of
funds into the main a/c ([Swiss Account 1]) for distribution into the 3 accounts.â

82. RAFOI, facilitated by Rincon and Shiera, also assisted the PDVSA
Defendants in opening individual accounts in the names of various entities rather
than in the PDVSA Defendantsâ own names. For example, on or about February 1,
2013, Cesar Rincon sent Shiera an e-mail attaching a copy of his passport and
utility bill. Shiera then forwarded this information to RAFOI, who requested in
addition a curriculum vitae. RAFOI asked Shiera, âShall I go ahead and order a
new Nevis company for Cesar?â Shiera replied to the e-mail, noting his
agreement.

83. On or about February 6, 2013, RAFOI sent Shiera an e-mail stating,
âA new Nevis company called [Swiss Account 8] will be formed with Cesar as the
Director/BO/Shareholder.â

Payments to the PDVSA Defendants and
Official Assistance to Rincon and Shiera

84. Rincon and Shiera made payments for the benefit of VILLALOBOS,

ISTURIZ, REITER, ALVARADO, De Leon, and Cesar Rincon using a variety

of bank accounts in the United States (including in the Southern District of Texas),

22

 
Switzerland, and Panama, to a variety of bank accounts, including, but not limited
to, the accounts referenced in Paragraphs 68 to 78 above.

85. For example, in total, accounts controlled by Rincon and Shiera
transferred over $27 million to Swiss Account 1, which transferred over $10
million to Swiss Account 2, over $16 million to Swiss Account 3, and over $1
million to Swiss Account 4, in connection with the scheme.

86. In exchange for these bribe and kickback payments, the PDVSA
Defendants provided assistance to Rincon and Shiera in getting paid on
outstanding PDVSA invoices and obtaining new PDVSA contracts.

87. For example, on or about October 10, 2011, ISTURIZ sent Shiera a
BBM message stating, as translated into English, âI got for you and Pelon [Rincon]
[Rincon Company 4] 1.3mm [Rincon Company 2] 1.2mm and [Shiera Company 2]
6.9.â Shiera replied, as translated into English, âThat [Shiera Company 2] is his. I
need in [Shiera Company 1] and [Shiera Company 3]. Check it please.â
ISTURIZ later responded, as translated into English, âShit, broâ, I had sent it
already! Let me see what I can do!â, to which Shiera replied, âChange it please.â
ISTURIZ responded, as translated into English, âPumita ! [Shiera] Relax, let
Piojo [{STURIZ] pamper you!â, to which Shiera replied, as translated into

English, âIâm in need of love $$$$$$ hahahaha.â

23
88. Consistent with ISTURIZâs BBM message, on or about October 17,
2011, PDVSA sent $6,980,000 to Shiera Company 2.

89. After several inter-company transfers, the funds referenced in
Paragraph 88 above were ultimately transferred to Rincon Company 2. On or
about October 26, 2011, Rincon Company 2 transferred $515,513.20 to Swiss
Account 1. Shortly thereafter, on or about November 2, 2011, Shiera Company 5
transferred $179,552.52 to Swiss Account 1. Then, on or about November 16,
2011, Swiss Account 1 transferred $100,000 to Swiss Account 2, $330,000 to
Swiss Account 3, and $215,000 to Swiss Account 4.

90. The PDVSA Defendants frequently checked with Rincon and Shiera
on the status of the bribe payments. For example, on or about December 20, 2011,
VILLALOBOS sent Shiera a BBM message stating, as translated into English,
âdonât forget to talk with your administrator, it Is vital the flow comes in
December,â which the conspirators understood to refer to bribe payments. Shiera
responded, as translated into English, âHe just confirmed youâ!l have it before this
Friday.â

91. On or about December 22, 2011, Shiera Company 5 made two
transfers to Swiss Account 1, one in the amount of $299,901.85 and another in the

amount of $362,485.68.

24
92. The PDVSA Defendants transferred the disbursed funds in Swiss
Account | amongst themselves, as discussed in Paragraph 89, and occasionally
also used Swiss Account | for other expenses incurred by the PDVSA Defendants.
For example, on or about June 15, 2012, VILLALOBOS instructed RAFOI to
transfer CHF 75,000 from Swiss Account 1 to an account in the name of Law Firm
2. Law Firm 2 had provided legal services to ALVARADO.

93. Rincon and Shiera frequently used De Leon and VILLALOBOS as
intermediaries for communications with or about the PDVSA Defendants. For
example, on or about November 24, 2011, Shiera sent VILLALOBOS a BBM
message stating, as translated into English, âBrother, Piojo [ISTURIZ] never fails.
He put mine at like $3.5M on the proposal and 5 for the ones from Pelon [Rincon]
according to what we talked about at dinner. Give him support.â VILLALOBOS
responded, as translated into English, âThat guy is good.â

94. In addition to help getting paid on outstanding invoices, Rincon and
Shiera also asked the PDVSA Defendants for their assistance in winning PDVSA
contracts. For example, on or about January 4, 2012, Shiera sent VILLALOBOS
a BBM message requesting VILLALOBOSâs assistance in securing a contract
over a competitor to supply equipment in relation to a PDVSA project.

95. On or about February 8, 2012, Shiera sent ISTURIZ a BBM message

asking, as translated into English, âWhatâs happened with the Motorgenerators?â

25
to which ISTURIZ replied, as translated into English, âCesar must sign it! I'll tell
him.â

96. The PDVSA Defendants corresponded with Rincon and Shiera about
PDVSA bidding panels as well as the official actions the PDVSA Defendants
would take on behalf of Rincon and Shiera. For example, on or about February 24,
2012, Shiera sent ISTURIZ a BBM message with a proposed panel of bidders for
an electric equipment panel. ISTURIZ responded, as translated into English,
âGood! Give me the panels for the others!! Get people moving on that! Look, I
have all the purchasers in my office beating them hardâ, to which Shiera replied, as
translated into English, âThat is my Piojo.â

97. In addition to allowing Rincon and Shiera to have input on PDVSA
bidding panels, as discussed in Paragraph 96 above, the PDVSA Defendants gave
Rincon and Shiera inside information on upcoming PDVSA projects so that they
could choose the projects that their companies bid on. For example, on or about
February 28, 2012, ISTURIZ e-mailed Rincon and Shiera, stating, as translated
into English, âIâm sending you a list of the process that we need to start tomorrow.
For the moment, theyâre processes for E&P [exploration and production] and Gas.

I started with e&p, because thatâs where the strength lies! I need to know before

10 am in which processes you want to participate in and the panel.â

26
98. On or about March 1, 2012, Rincon responded to the e-mail from
ISTURIZ referenced in Paragraph 97 above, copying Shiera, stating, as translated
into English, âAttached you will find what we are going to work on highlighted in
YELLOW. These are drilling parts and equipment. There is one from Abraham.â
Attached was a highlighted list of equipment PDVSA sought to purchase with the
corresponding internal budgets. |

99. The PDVSA Defendants frequently sent Rincon and Shiera updates of
the money they expected to receive in bribes in exchange for the payments Rincon
and Shiera were receiving on outstanding PDVSA invoices as a result of the
bribery scheme. The PDVSA Defendants occasionally sent Rincon and Shiera the
payment proposals themselves, either in draft form for input or in final form so
Rincon and Shiera could see how much money their companies were expected to
receive (and, in turn, how much they would need to pay in bribes). For example,
on or about January 5, 2012, ISTURIZ sent Rincon an e-mail stating, as translated
into English, âI need you to check these numbers. They are the payments for
payment proposal. The date that is on each payment corresponds to the Monday of
the week of the proposal. The date will not coincide with the one on which you
received the money, donât focus on that, just the amounts.â Attached was a
PDVSA payment proposal document setting forth vendors to be paid, (including a

number of Rinconâs companies) and the dates and amounts of the payments.

27
100. In addition, on or about May 17, 2013, Cesar Rincon sent himself a
PDVSA payment proposal from his PDVSA e-mail account to a personal e-mail
account. He forwarded it to VILLALOBOS, Shiera, and Rincon with the
message, as translated into English, âIâve attached the proposal reviewed and
approved by Javier [ALVARADO].â The attached payment proposal included
payments to a number of Shieraâs and Rinconâs companies, including Shiera
Company 1, Shiera Company 2, Shiera Company 3, Rincon Company 2, Rincon
Company 5, and Rincon Company 7.

101. The PDVSA Defendants also frequently reminded Rincon and Shiera
of how much they owed in bribe payments, using coded or vague language to
conceal what they were talking about. For example, on or about March 15, 2012,
De Leon sent Shiera a BBM message stating, as translated into English, âWere you
able to able to buy the things? Debt from the friends as of today $1,093,232â,
which the conspirators understood to be a reference to outstanding bribe payments.

102. Within a week of De Leonâs message, accounts controlled by Rincon
and Shiera then made a series of transfers to Swiss Account 1, totaling just over $1
million. On or about March 19, 2012, Swiss Account 5 transferred $536,005.42 to
Swiss Account 1. The next day, March 20, 2012, Shiera Company 5 transferred

ISTURIZ sent Rincon and Shiera instructions to pay various bank accounts, held
in the names of various companies. ISTURIZ made coded references to paying
bribes in exchange for future PDVSA business. For example, on or about March
22, 2012, ISTURIZ sent Rincon and Shiera an e-mail stating, as translated into
English, âHi P and P, Iâm sending you the coordinates in order for you to send me
something to buy coal to keep cooking the stew. ... We can use this account
while weâre opening the other one.â ISTURIZ concluded the e-mail with the
account and wire information for Curacao Account 1.

104. On or about April 2, 2012, Rincon Company 2 transferred $450,000
from its bank account in the Southern District of Texas to Curacao Account 1.
Over the following several weeks, Curacao Account | made a series of transfers to
Swiss Account 7.

105. On or about May 13, 2012, ISTURIZ sent Rincon and Shiera an e-
mail stating, as translated into English, âDear friends, Iâm sending you the
coordinates to move ahead somewhat on the payments while the other account is
being opened. I need to notify the friend at the bank before the money arrives.
Attached is a spreadsheet showing a summary of payments over the past 3 weeks.â
Set forth below was the account and wire information for Swiss Account 7.

Attached was a chart setting forth various Rincon and Shiera companies, the

29

 

 
amounts they had been paid by PDVSA for a three-week period, and two figures
representing bribe payments due in the amount of 10% and 2%.

106. On or about May 16, 2012, Rincon Company 2 transferred

[Swiss Account 7], 367,069.19 [Swiss Account 7]. THE TOTAL IS...USD
1,700,447.30.... Paulo, the problem is that sometimes we take the amount
considering the entire payment and sometimes we need to subtract 5% for our

alliesâ. ... Forgive the trouble but it is being deposited today and this way we

have a difference of USD 0000000000000000000000000000.00.â

conceal the nature and ownership of the proceeds. On or about July 12, 2012,
ISTURIZ forwarded account and wire information for U.S. Account 1 from
ISTURIZ Associate 1 to Rincon and Shiera, copying ISTURIZ Associate 1.

to start using this route. Copy to the person who is responsible for setting

everything up so that it is all really well shielded.â

Swiss Account 7.

120. On or about August 29, 2012, ISTURIZ sent Rincon and Shiera an e-
mail stating, as translated into English, âI am sending you the list up to this weekâs
proposal, which I am putting together. The numbers are going to stay like this!
Merry Christmas even though it isnât.â Attached were four charts â the first two
set forth various Rincon companies and various Shiera companies, along with the
amounts that each had been paid by PDVSA over the course of several weeks. The
second two, entitled âRRâ and âAS,â respectively, set forth various payment
amounts and payment destinations for bribe payments to ISTURIZ.

121. On or about November 30, 2012, Shiera sent De Leon a BBM

message stating, as translated into English, âI have $20MM approved to collect for

32
 

this week. Iâd appreciate your help with at least one invoice for $15MM. Let me
know.â On the same day, De Leon replied, âIâll help you with the payment.â

122. On or about February 19, 2013, Rincon Company 2 transferred
$200,000 to an account in the name of REITER Relative 1. Rincon sent the
payment confirmation to REITER by e-mail.

$250,000 to an account in the name of REITER Relative 1. Rincon sent the

124. DeLeon and VILLALOBOS continued to act as intermediaries
between Rincon and Shiera and ISTURIZ, ALVARADO, REITER, Cesar
Rincon, and Official B. For example, on or about March 11, 2013,
VILLALOBOS sent Shiera a BBM message stating, as translated into English,
âDid you get the second one for Nadal [REITER]? The one for 130?â Shiera sent
VILLALOBOS a BBM message stating, as translated into English, âThe $130k
transfer was returned to me, they say that the iban is wrong. Can you ask for it
again? This is Nadalâs [REITERâs].â VILLALOBOS responded, as translated
into English, âYes that is it, Iâm going to ask for it.â

125. For example, in or about March 13, 2013, VILLALOBOS sent Shiera

a BBM message stating, as translated into English, âBrother, I met with Primo

33
 

[Cesar Rincon], I asked him to adjust the proposal with around 75 percent of your
invoice to convince J [ALVARADO] to sign it... .â

126. In addition, on or about May 3, 2013, VILLALOBOS sent Shiera a
BBM message stating, as translated into English, âJ [ALVARADO] wrote to me,
he said he got a good ration this week.â

127. In order to disguise the nature and ownership of the bribe proceeds,
instead of having money sent directly to an account he controlled, REITER
frequently directed bribe money to third parties for his benefit. For example,
REITER directed that some of the money he was owed in connection with the
scheme be used to purchase a condominium in the name of a company controlled
by REITER Relative 1. On or about August 17, 2012, a representative of Law
Firm 1 sent Rincon Associate 1 the closing documents for a condominium at the
Four Seasons in Miami and requested that Rincon Associate 1 direct REITER
Relative 1 to execute the documents. The documents reflected that the buyer of the
condominium was a Florida corporation of which REITER Relative 1 was the
president.

128. On or about August 17, 2012, Rincon sent REITER an e-mail,
attaching the closing documentation referenced in Paragraph 127 above, stating, as

translated into English, âI need this signed by [REITER Relative 1] and returned to

34
 

me.â On or about August 21, 2012, REITER returned the documents referenced
in Paragraph 127 to Rincon by e-mail, executed by REITER Relative 1.

129. On or about August 23, 2012, Rincon Company 5 transferred
$867,619.62 to Law Firm 1âs attorney trust account, in connection with the
purchase of the condominium for REITER referenced in Paragraph 127 above.

REITER forwarded Rincon an investment agreement from Production Company
A to invest in a film, on or about May 21, 2013, at the direction of Rincon
Associate 1, Rincon Company 7 transferred $1.5 million to Production Company
A. Rincon sent the confirmation of the transfer to REITER by e-mail on or about
May 22, 2013.

131. On or about September 14, 2013, Rincon, copying Cesar Rincon,
directed a relative by e-mail to send $200,000 to Swiss Account 8. Cesar Rincon
replied, as translated into English, âThank you cousin!â

132. On or about September 16, 2013, Rincon Company 2 transferred
$200,000 to Swiss Account 8.

Gifts and Other Things of Value
133. In addition to monetary bribes, Rincon and Shiera provided the

PDVSA Defendants with gifts, recreational travel, and other things of value in

35
exchange for their assistance in connection with Rinconâs and Shieraâs business
with PDVSA.

134. For example, on or about November 30, 2011, Shiera received a
reservation confirmation by e-mail for a beach house in Parrot Cay in the Bahamas
made in the name of ISTURIZ, which Shiera then forwarded on to ISTURIZ
noting, as translated into English, âDone, Piojo.â

135. In addition, on or about January 15, 2013, Rincon Company 2
purchased a $107,500 armored car from a company in Texas for the benefit of
REITER. On or about March 18, 2013, Rincon Company 2 purchased a second

136. On or about February 28, 2013, Shiera received an e-mail requesting
that he pay $26,170.00 to a grocery store in Aruba where multiple people,
including the PDVSA Defendants, would charge items to Shieraâs account. On
March 1, 2013, Shiera forwarded the email to Shiera Associate 1, attaching an
spreadsheet listing various grocery items and prices, and directed Shiera Associate
1 to pay the grocery store and charge the expense to Shiera Company 1.The
spreadsheet included items charged by VILLALOBOS, ALVARADO, and Cesar
Rincon, including cases of lobster and steak, bottles of wine, and bottles of Scotch.

137. Similarly, on or about June 6, 2013, a luxury hotel in Aruba sent

Shiera confirmations for a number of hotel rooms, including rooms for Cesar

36
 

 

Rincon and REITER. A note next to both Cesar Rinconâs and REITERâs room
confirmations stated, âThis room will be paid by Mr. Shiera.â

138. On or about August 1, 2013, Rincon purchased a $10,300 handbag for
REITER Relative 1 at a store in the Southern District of Texas.

139. On or about July 3, 2014, REITER forwarded Rincon invoices dated
June 26, 2014, for English classes for two of Official Bâs children, one in the
amount of $16,672 and the other in the amount of $8,755.

140. On or about July 4, 2014, Rincon Company 2 made two transfers, one
in the amount of $16,672 and the other in the amount of $8,755, to a bank account
in the name of the school where Official Bâs children were taking English classes.

companies in obtaining and retaining business for and with, and directing
business to, Rincon, Shiera, their companies, and others, in violation of
the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, Title 15, United States Code, Section
78dd-3(a).
Purpose of the Conspiracy
143. The purpose of the conspiracy was for De Leon, VILLALOBOS,
RAFOI, and their co-conspirators to enrich themselves and others by directing
bribes to the PDVSA Defendants, including a portion of which De Leon and
VILLALOBOS kept for themselves, to assist Rincon, Shiera, and others in
obtaining and retaining lucrative energy contracts with PDVSA through corrupt
and fraudulent means.
Manner and Means of the Conspiracy
144. The manner and means by which De Leon, VILLALOBOS, RAFOI,
and their co-conspirators sought to accomplish the purpose of the conspiracy
included, among other things, the following, while in the Southern District of

Texas and elsewhere:

40
145. De Leon and VILLALOBOS offered Rincon and Shiera, as well as
others, the opportunity to receive payment priority over other PDVSA vendors on
outstanding PDVSA invoices and to receive assistance in winning future PDVSA
contracts, in exchange for bribes paid to the PDVSA Defendants, of which De
Leon and VILLALOBOS would receive a portion.

146. Atthe direction of De Leon and VILLALOBOS, Rincon and Shiera,
together with others, paid bribes to the PDVSA Defendants through the use of
interstate and foreign wires in order to secure any improper business advantage,
influence acts and decisions of Cesar Rincon, ISTURIZ, REITER, and
ALVARADO in their official capacities, and to induce Cesar Rincon, ISTURIZ,
REITER, and ALVARADO to do and omit to do certain acts, including, but not
limited to:

a. including Rinconâs and Shieraâs companies on payment proposals and
approving those payment proposals so that Rinconâs and Shieraâs
companies could receive payments on outstanding PDVSA invoices;

b. assisting Rinconâs and Shieraâs companies in winning PDVSA contracts;

c. providing Rincon and Shiera with inside information concerning the
PDVSA bidding process;

d. placing one or more of Rinconâs and Shieraâs companies on certain

bidding panels for PDVSA projects; and

41
e. ensuring that Rincon and Shiera were not subject to any internal

investigations at PDVSA.

147. At their request, RAFOI opened Swiss bank accounts for De Leon,
VILLALOBOS, and ALVARADO. Each account was opened in the name of a
Scottish partnership, to hide the true owner.

148. At the direction of De Leon and VILLALOBOS, Rincon and Shiera,
together with others, caused bribe payments to be wired from the bank accounts of
Rinconâs companies and Shieraâs companies to bank accounts set up by RAFOT
and controlled by De Leon and VILLALOBOS with the understanding that the
funds would be split among De Leon, VILLALOBOS, Cesar Rincon, ISTURIZ,
REITER, ALVARADO, and Official B.

149. De Leon and VILLALOBOS then provided additional directions to
RAFOI regarding disbursement of the funds.

150. RAFOI also discussed opening an account for Official B with
VILLALOBOS and Shiera.

151. In addition to monetary bribes, Rincon and Shiera, together with
others, provided other things of value to the PDVSA Defendants including
recreational travel, vehicles, gifts (including watches and wine), meals, and
entertainment, in order to receive payment priority on outstanding PDVSA

invoices and to obtain and retain business with PDVSA.

Section 1956(a)(2)(A).
Manner and Means of the Conspiracy

187. The manner and means by which ALVARADO, MURTA, and their
co-conspirators sought to accomplish the purpose of the conspiracy included,
among other things, the following, while in the Southern District of Texas and
elsewhere:

188. ALVARADO, De Leon, and VILLALOBOS promised Rincon,
Shiera, and others known and unknown to the Grand Jury assistance with getting
paid on outstanding invoices on PDVSA contracts, as well as assistance with
winning new PDVSA contracts, in exchange for bribe payments.

189. VILLALOBOS and BES Banker | told Rincon and Shiera that
Rincon and Shiera should open bank accounts at Banco Espirito Santo (âBESâ),
the bank PDVSA used, to facilitate continued payments from PDVSA.

190. MURTA, together with others, assisted the PDVSA Defendants,

Rincon, Shiera, and others known and unknown to the grand jury, in opening bank

54
accounts, including bank accounts in Dubai, for the PDVSA Defendants and their
co-conspirators to receive bribe payments.

191. MURTA, who was not a BES employee, worked closely with BES
Banker 1 and BES Banker 2 to set up the structures and accounts used in the
money laundering scheme.

192. De Leon, VILLALOBOS, and ALVARADO directed bribe
payments to be sent to various recipients other than the intended PDVSA
Defendants, including companies, intermediaries, relatives, friends, and close
personal associates of the PDVSA Defendants, for the purpose of concealing and
disguising the nature, source, and ownership of the bribe payments.

193. MURTA, Shiera, and Shiera Associate 1, each and together with
others, created false justifications for certain of the bribes, including loan
documents for false loans that were never intended to be repaid, and contracts
intended to obscure the purpose of the wire transfers, for the purpose of concealing
and disguising the nature, source, and ownership of those bribe payments.

194. Rincon and Shiera, together with others, directed and caused the wire
transfer of bribe payments to bank accounts as instructed by MURTA,
VILLALOBOS, and others, for the purpose of promoting the bribery and money

laundering scheme.

BES Dubai account under VILLALOBOSâs control. BES Account | was used in
connection with the scheme.

197. âBES Account 2,â whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was a
BES Dubai account under VILLALOBOSâs control. BES Account 2 was used in
connection with the scheme.

BES Dubai account under ALVARADOâs control. In or about 2013, BES
Account 3 was closed in Dubai and then reopened in Switzerland. BES Account 3
was used in connection with the scheme.

199. âBES Account 4,â whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was a
BES Dubai account under De Leonâs control, for which De Leon Associate 1 was
the listed beneficial owner. BES Account 4 was used in connection with the

scheme.

56
200. âBES Account 5,â whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was a |
BES Dubai account under Shieraâs control. BES Account 5 was opened for the
purpose of being used in the scheme.

201. âBES Account 6,â whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was a
BES Dubai account under Rinconâs control. BES Account 6 was opened for the
purpose of being used in the scheme.

202. âBES Account 7,â whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was a
BES Portugal account under Shieraâs control. BES Account 7 was used in
connection with the scheme.

BES Dubai account. BES Account 8 was used in connection with the scheme.

204. âMacau Account 1,â whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was
an account at the Bank of China, Macau Branch. Macau Account | was used in
connection with the scheme.

205. After VILLALOBOS and BES Banker 1 requested that Rincon and
Shiera begin using BES to receive payments from PDVSA and to pay the PDVSA
Defendants, MURTA, BES Banker 1, and BES Banker 2 assisted Rincon and

Shiera in opening their own accounts at BES.

57
206. On or about February 28 or 29, 2012, MURTA traveled to Miami,
Florida, to meet with Shiera, Shiera Associate 1, and others in connection with the
scheme.

207. MURTA, the PDVSA Defendants, Shiera, Rincon, and their co-
conspirators communicated, including via e-mail, phone, various messaging
applications, and meeting in person, about the BES accounts and the need to
submit documentation to justify the payments.

208. On or about May 3, 2012, MURTA sent Shiera Associate 1 an e-mail
providing the bank account information for, as translated into English, âour

English, âHi.ok.â On March 11, 2013, MURTA sent Shiera a BBM asking Shiera
to confirm, as translated into English, âas agreed [Shiera Associate 1] will do the
contracts for yours and Robertoâs. Correct?â

The $4.8 Million âLoanâ to BES Account 1

212. One of the methods that MURTA, Sheira, Rincon, and Shiera
Associate | used to pay bribes to VILLALOBOS, ALVARADO, and De Leon
was through a fake loan between Swiss Account 5 and BES Account 1. To that
end, on May 8, 2012, MURTA sent Shiera Associate 1 an e-mail providing the
bank account information for BES Account 1.

please.â Shiera responded, as translated into English, â[w]hat I have pending with
the group is exactly $6,413,235.â VILLALOBOS then asked, as translated into

companies in obtaining and retaining business for and with, and directing
business to, Rincon, Shiera, their companies, and others, in violation of
the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, Title 15, United States Code, Section
78dd-3(a).
Purpose of the Conspiracy
237. The purpose of the conspiracy was for MURTA, VILLALOBOS, De
Leon, and their co-conspirators, to enrich themselves and others by directing bribes
to PDVSA officials, a portion of which De Leon and VILLALOBOS kept, to
assist Rincon, Shiera, and others in obtaining and retaining lucrative energy
contracts with PDVSA through corrupt and fraudulent means.
Manner and Means of the Conspiracy
238. The manner and means by which MURTA, VILLALOBOS, De
Leon, and their co-conspirators sought to accomplish the purpose of the conspiracy
included, among other things, the following, while in the Southern District of

Texas and elsewhere:

67
239. As explained in Paragraphs 58 through 64 and 144 through 150,
Rincon and Shiera agreed to pay bribes to the PDVSA Defendants in exchange for
business advantages in connection with their business with PDVSA.

240. At the direction of De Leon and VILLALOBOS, Rincon and Shiera,
together with others, caused bribe payments to be wired from the bank accounts of
Rinconâs and Shieraâs companies to bank accounts set up by MURTA and
controlled by De Leon and VILLALOBOS with the understanding that the funds
would be disbursed to the PDVSA Defendants and Official B.

241. MURTA often provided, either directly or through VILLALOBOS,
to Rincon and Shiera the account information for the specific bank accounts into
which they were to make payments.

242. VILLALOBOS instructed Rincon to pay bribes from accounts
_ outside the United States. Rincon transferred money from inside the United States
to accounts outside the United States for the purpose of paying bribes from the
accounts outside the United States.

243. In addition to monetary bribes, Rincon and Shiera, together with
others, provided other things of value to the PDVSA Defendants, including
recreational travel, vehicles, gifts (including watches and wine), meals, and
entertainment, in order to receive payment priority on outstanding PDVSA

invoices and to obtain and retain business with PDVSA.

68
244. Rincon and Shiera also paid bribes to other PDVSA officials in
addition to the bribes paid to the PDVSA Defendants. One such official was
Official C, who assisted Shiera in winning contracts with PDVSA and provided
Shiera with inside information regarding PDVSA in exchange for bribe payments.

245. MURTA assisted Shiera in opening BES Account 9, a bank account
whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, and which MURTA opened for
Official C in the name of a relative of Official C, knowing that Official C was a
Venezuelan official and that the account would be used to receive bribe payments.

246. Prior to 2012, MURTA had opened BES Account 10, a bank account
whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, and which was opened in the name of
REITER Associate 1 for REITERâs benefit.

Overt Acts

247. In furtherance of the conspiracy and to achieve the objects thereof, at
least one of the co-conspirators committed or caused to be committed, in the
Southern District of Texas and elsewhere, at least one of the following overt acts,
among others:

248. On or about January 25, 2012, MURTA sent Shiera an e-mail
containing a breakdown of the fees that needed to be paid in order to re-activate

REITERâs account at BES.

69
249. On or about February 14, 2012, MURTA sent Shiera an e-mail
containing account information for REITERâs account at BES.

250. On or about March 6, 2013, VILLALOBOS sent an e-mail to Rincon
with the subject line âFwd: Coordenadasâ containing the account information for
Macau Account 1 and MURTAâs signature block at the bottom.

251. In or about March 2013, VILLALOBOS requested that Rincon send
bribe money to Macau Account | from an account not located in the United States.

252. On or about March 14, 2013, Shiera sent MURTA a BBM stating, as
translated into English, âHi Paulo. Please confirm for me that [Official Câs]âs
account in the name of [a relative of Official Câs] is ready to be funded. Also let
me know the costs that have to be paid for the opening of the structure and the
account.â

253. On or about March 14, 2013, MURTA responded, as translated into
English, âYes the account is ready. Iâll send the costs later[.]ââ

254. On or about March 15, 2013, MURTA sent Shiera a BBM asking, as

THE UNITED STATES CHARGES:
At all times relevant to this Information, unless otherwise stated:

I. The Defendant and Relevant Entities

 

1. Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (ââPDVSAâ) was a Venezuelan state-owned
and state-controlled oil company. PDVSA and its subsidiaries and affiliates were responsible for
exploration, production, refining, transportation and trade in energy resources in Venezuela.
PDVSA supplied asphalt, among other products, to companies around the world, and also
provided funding for various operations of the Venezuelan government. PDVSA and its wholly-
owned subsidiaries were âinstrumentalitiesâ of the Venezuelan government, as that term is
defined in the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (ââFCPAâ), Title 15, United States Code, Sections
78dd-1 et seq. PDVSA officers and employees were âforeign officials,â as that term is defined
in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Sections 78dd-2(h)(2) and 78dd-3(f)(2).

2. Asphalt Company, the identity of which is known to the United States,

was an asphalt company headquartered in Puerto Rico that operated primarily in Latin America
and the Caribbean. Asphalt Company was a âdomestic concern,â as that term is defined in the
FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2(h)(1).

3. Sargeant Marine Inc. was a company incorporated and based in the United
States that stored, transported and traded asphalt. Sargeant Marine Inc. was one of the largest
asphalt providers in the world and had several affiliates and joint ventures that traded asphalt
internationally (together, âSargeant Marineâ). Sargeant Marine Inc. was a âdomestic concern,â
as that term is defined in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2(h)(1).

4. The defendant DANIEL COMORETTO GOMEZ (ââCOMORETTOââ) was
a dual citizen of Venezuela and Italy and, since in or about September 2018, a lawful permanent
resident of the United States. COMORETTO was a manager at PDVSA involved in the trading
of asphalt in or about and between at least 2010 and 2012. During that trme, COMORETTO was
a âforeign official,â as that term is defined in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Sections
78dd-2(h)(2) and 78dd-3(f)(2).

5. Hector Nufiez Troyano (âTroyanoââ) was a dual citizen of Spain and
Venezuela. Troyano was an employee at PDVSA in or about and between 2008 and February
2015, and was involved in the sale of PDVSA asphalt. During that time, Troyano was a âforeign
official,â as that term is defined in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Sections 78dd-
2(h)(2) and 78dd-3(f)(2). Troyano was supervised by the defendant DANIEL COMORETTO
GOMEZ in or about and between 2010 and 2013.

6. David Diaz (âDiazâ) was a citizen of Venezuela and, as of approximately
2014, a naturalized U.S. citizen. From in or about and between 2011 and December 2017, Diaz

worked as an agent for Sargeant Marine and Asphalt Company. Diaz was a âdomestic concernâ

2
Case 1:21-cr-00014-ENV Document16 Filed 01/27/21 Page 3 of 7 PagelD #: 66

and an âagentâ of a âdomestic concern,â as those terms are defined in the FCPA, Title 15, United
States Code, Section 78dd-2(h)(1).

7. Asphalt Company Executive, an individual whose identity is known to the
United States, was a citizen of the United States who worked as a principal of Asphalt Company.
Asphalt Company Executive was a âdomestic concernâ and an âagentâ of a âdomestic concern,â
as those terms are defined in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2(h)(1).

Il. The Bribery and Money Laundering Scheme

 

8. In or about and between 2011 and October 2015, the defendant DANIEL
COMORETTO GOMEZ agreed with Troyano, Diaz, Asphalt Company Executive and, later,
several employees of Sargeant Marine, to participate in a scheme in which COMORETTO and
Troyano would receive bribes, facilitated by Diaz, from Asphalt Company and, later, Sargeant
Marine, in order to assist those companies in obtaining contracts to purchase asphalt from
PDVSA.

9. In or about 2011, the defendant DANIEL COMORETTO GOMEZ,
Troyano and Diaz traveled to Puerto Rico to meet with Asphalt Company Executive and other
executives of Asphalt Company. During that trip it was agreed that Asphalt Company
Executive, with the help of Diaz, would pay bribes to COMORETTO and Troyano to assist
Asphalt Company in winning term contracts to purchase asphalt from PDVSA. In or about
2012, COMORETTO, Troyano, Diaz and others agreed to a similar arrangement with Sargeant
Marine.

10. In furtherance of the scheme, in or about and between 2011 and 2015,

Asphalt Company and Sargeant Marine paid Diaz a commission of approximately 45 cents for

3
every barrel of asphalt that either Asphalt Company or Sargeant Marine purchased from PDVSA.
Diaz in turn used a portion of his commissions to pay bribes to the defendant DANIEL
COMORETTO GOMEZ, Troyano and others.

11. To promote and conceal the bribery scheme, payments to the defendant
DANIEL COMORETTO GOMEZ, Troyano and others involved in the scheme were sometimes
paid to or through bank accounts held by shell companies belonging to Diaz and Troyano. In or
about and between approximately September 2013 and January 2015, Diaz wired a total of
approximately $518,000 in payments to COMORETTO and Troyano on behalf of Asphalt
Company and Sargeant Marine. Diaz wired such payments from accounts that Diaz controlled in
the United States and Panama to Panamanian bank accounts held in the name of a shell company
controlled by Troyano. Troyano in turn wired a portion of those payments to a bank account in
the United States controlled by COMORETTO.

12. In or about and between April 2012 and September 2014, Troyano and
Diaz wired a total of approximately $229,000 in bribes to the defendant DANIEL
COMORETTO GOMEZ. Troyano and Diaz made the majority of the payments using bank
accounts located outside the United States, specifically in Panama, and, following transfers
between bank accounts held by Troyano in Panama, the bribes were wired into an account that
COMORETTO held at Bank of America in the United States to promote and conceal the scheme.
Approximately 22 of these wires were sent through bank accounts located in New York, New

York, which payments passed through the Eastern District of New York.

CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT MONEY LAUNDERING

 

13. The allegations contained in paragraphs one through 12 are realleged and
incorporated as if fully set forth in this paragraph.

14. In or about and between 2011 and October 2015, both dates being
approximate and inclusive, within the Eastern District of New York and elsewhere, the defendant
DANIEL COMORETTO GOMEZ, together with others, did knowingly and intentionally
conspire to transport, transmit and transfer monetary instruments and funds from a place in the
United States to and through a place outside the United States and to a place in the United States
from and through a place outside the United States:

(a) with the intent to promote the carrying on of one or more specified
unlawful activities, to wit: felony violations of the FCPA, in violation of Title 15, United States
Code, Sections 78dd-2 and 78dd-3 (the âSpecified Unlawful Activitiesâ), contrary to Title 18,
United States Code, Section 1956(a)(2)(A); and

(b) knowing that the monetary instruments and funds involved in the
transportation, transmission and transfer represented the proceeds of some form of unlawful
activity, and knowing that such transportation, transmission and transfer was designed in whole
and in part to conceal and disguise the nature, location, source, ownership and control of the
proceeds of one or more specified unlawful activities, to wit: the Specified Unlawful Activities,
contrary to Title 18, United States Code, Section 1956(a)(2)(B)q).

Department of Justice (âFraud Sectionâ), and Christopher Cestaro and Kevin R. Gingras, Trial
Attorneys, Fraud Section, and Defendant, Daniel Perez (âDefendantâ), and Defendantâs counsel,
pursuant to Rule 11(c)(1)(B) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, state that they have
entered into an agreement, the terms and conditions of which are as follows:

The Defendantâs Agreement

I. Defendant agrees to plead guilty to Count One of the Information. Count One

States Code, Section 78dd-2 (âFCPAâ), in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 371.

beyond a reasonable doubt.

Punishment Range
2. The statutory maximum penalty for a violation of Title 18, United States Code,

Section 371, is a term of imprisonment of not more than five years and a fine of not more than
$250,000 or twice the pecuniary gain or loss from the crime. Additionally, Defendant may receive
a term of supervised release after imprisonment of up to three years. See Title 18, United States
Code, Sections 3571(b)(3), 3571(d), and 3583(b)(2). Defendant acknowledges and understands
that if he should violate the conditions of any period of supervised release which may be imposed
as part of his sentence, then Defendant may be imprisoned for the entire term of supervised release,
without credit for time already served on the term of supervised release prior to such violation.
See Title 18, United States Code, Section 3583(e)(3). Defendant understands that he cannot have
the imposition or execution of the sentence suspended, nor is he eligible for parole.
Mandatory Special Assessment

3. Pursuant to Title 18, United States Code, Section 3013(a)(2)(A), immediately after
sentencing, Defendant will pay to the Clerk of the United States District Court a special assessment
in the amount of one hundred dollars ($100.00) per count of conviction.

Immigration Consequences

4, Defendant recognizes that pleading guilty may have consequences with respect to
his immigration status if he is not a citizen of the United States. Defendant understands that if he
is not a citizen of the United States, by pleading guilty he may be removed from the United States,
denied citizenship, and denied admission to the United States in the future. Defendantâs attorney
has advised Defendant of the potential immigration consequences resulting from Defendantâs plea

of guilty.
Case 7iis-cr-O1164 Document 25 Filedin TXSDoan P/Oe/16 Page Sof 1s
. Cooperation
5. The parties understand this Agreement carries the potential for a motion for

departure under Section SK1.1 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines (âSentencing
Guidelinesâ). Defendant understands and agrees that whether such a motion is filed will be
determined solely by the United States through the United States Attorney for the Southern District
of Texas and the Fraud Section. Should Defendantâs cooperation, in the sole judgment and
discretion of the United States, amount to âsubstantial assistance,â the United States reserves the
sole right to file a motion for departure pursuant to Section 5K1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines.
Defendant. further agrees to persist in that plea through sentencing, and fully cooperate with the
United States. | Defendant understands and agrees that the United States will request that
sentencing be deferred until that cooperation is complete.

6. Defendant understands and agrees that the usage âfully cooperate,â as used herein,
includes providing all information relating to any criminal activity known to Defendant, including,
but not limited to, violations of the FCPA. Defendant understands that such information includes
both state and federal offenses arising therefrom. In that regard:

(a) Defendant agrees that this Plea Agreement binds only the United States
Attorney for the Southern District of Texas, and the United States
Department of Justice, Criminal Division, Fraud Section, and Defendant,
and that it does not bind any other United States Attorney or other
component or unit of the Department of Justice;

(b) Defendant agrees to testify truthfully as a witness before a grand jury or in
any other judicial or administrative proceeding when called upon to do so
by the United States. Defendant further agrees to waive his Fifth
Amendment privilege against self-incrimination for the purpose of this

Agreement;

(c) Defendant agrees to voluntarily attend any interviews and conferences as
the United States may request;

(d) Defendant agrees to provide truthful, complete, and accurate information
and testimony and understands any false statements made by Defendant to
the grand jury or at any court proceeding (criminal or civil), or to a
government agent or attorney, can and will be prosecuted under the
appropriate perjury, false statement, or obstruction statutes;

(e) Defendant agrees to provide to the United States all documents in his
possession or under his control relating to all areas of inquiry and
investigation; and

(f) Should the recommended departure, if any, not meet Defendantâs
expectations, Defendant understands he remains bound by the terms of this
Agreement and that he cannot, for that reason alone, withdraw his plea.

The United Statesâ Agreements
7. The United States agrees to each of the following:

(a) At the time of sentencing, the United States agrees not to oppose
Defendantâs anticipated request to the Court and the United States Probation
Office that he receive a two-level downward adjustment under Section
3E1.1(a) of the Sentencing Guidelines should Defendant accept
responsibility as contemplated by the Sentencing Guidelines; and

(b) If Defendant qualifies for an adjustment under U.S.S.G. Section 3E1.1(a)
and Defendantâs offense level is 16 or greater, the United States may move
for an additional one-level downward adjustment based on the timeliness of
the plea or the expeditious manner in which Defendant provided complete

information regarding his role in the offense.

Agreement Binding Only Southern District of Texas and
U.S. Department of Justice, Criminal Division, Fraud Section

8. The United States agrees that it will not further criminally prosecute Defendant in
the Southern District of Texas for offenses arising from conduct charged in the Information. This
Plea Agreement binds only the United States Attorneyâs Office for the Southern District of Texas;
the United States Department of Justice, Criminal Division, Fraud Section; and Defendant. It does
not bind any other United States Attorney or any other component or unit of the Department of
Justice. The United States will bring this Plea Agreement and the full extent of Defendantâs

cooperation to the attention of other prosecuting offices if requested.
Case 7il6-cr-02164 Document25 Filedin TXSDon 1/02/16 Page 5 of 13
United Statesâ Non-Waiver of Appeal
9. The United States reserves the right to carry out its responsibilities under the
Sentencing Guidelines. Specifically, the United States reserves the right to:
(a) Bring its version of the facts of this case, including its evidence file and

any investigative files, to the attention of the Probation Office in
connection with that officeâs preparation of a presentence report;

(b) Set forth or dispute sentencing factors or facts material to sentencing;

(c) Seek resolution of such factors or facts in conference with Defendantâs
counsel and the Probation Office;

(d) File a pleading relating to these issues, in accordance with U.S.S.G.
Section 6A1.2 and Title 18, United States Code, Section 3553(a); and

(e) Appeal the sentence imposed or the manner in which it was determined.
Sentence Determination

10. Defendant is aware that a sentence has not yet been determined by the Court.
Defendant is also aware that any estimate of the possible sentencing range under the Sentencing
Guidelines that he may have received from his counsel, the United States, or the Probation Office,
is a prediction, not a promise, and such estimate did not induce his guilty plea and is binding on
neither the United States, the Probation Office, nor the Court. The United States does not make
any promise or representation concerning what sentence Defendant will receive. Defendant is
aware that the sentence will be imposed after consideration of the Sentencing Guidelines, as well
as the provisions of Title 18, United States Code, Section 3553(a). Defendant further understands
and agrees that the Sentencing Guidelines are âeffectively advisoryâ to the Court. United States
v. Booker, 125 S.Ct. 738 (2005). Accordingly, Defendant understands that, although the Court
must consult the Sentencing Guidelines and must take them into account when sentencing

Defendant, the Court is not bound to follow the Sentencing Guidelines nor sentence Defendant
within the calculated guideline range. Defendant acknowledges and agrees that the Court has
authority to impose any sentence up to and including the statutory maximum set for the offense(s)
to which Defendant pleads guilty, and that the sentence to be imposed is within the sole discretion
of the sentencing judge after the Court has consulted the applicable Sentencing Guidelines.
Defendant understands and agrees the partiesâ positions regarding the application of the
Sentencing Guidelines do not bind the Court, and that the sentence imposed is within the discretion
of the sentencing judge. If the Court should impose any sentence up to the maximum established
by statute, or should the Court order any or all of the sentences imposed to run consecutively,
Defendant cannot, for that reason alone, withdraw a guilty plea, and will remain bound to fulfill
all of the obligations under this Plea Agreement.
Waiver of Rights

11. Defendant represents to the Court that he is satisfied that his attorney has rendered
effective assistance. Defendant understands that by entering into this Agreement, he surrenders
certain rights as provided in this Plea Agreement. Defendant understands that those rights include
the following:

(a) Defendant understands that he has the right to have the facts of this case
presented to a federal grand jury, consisting of between sixteen and twenty-
three citizens, twelve of whom would have to find probable cause to believe
that he committed the offense set forth in the information before an

indictment could be returned. The defendant acknowledges that he is
knowingly and intelligently waiving his right to be indicted.

(b) If Defendant persisted in a plea of not guilty to the charges, Defendant
would have the right to a speedy jury trial with the assistance of counsel.
The trial may be conducted by a judge sitting without a jury if Defendant,
the United States, and the court all agree.

(c) Ata trial, the United States would be required to present witnesses and other
evidence against Defendant. Defendant would have the opportunity to
confront those witnesses and his attorney would be allowed to cross-
examine them. In turn, Defendant could, but would not be required to,
present witnesses and other evidence on his own behalf. If the witnesses
for Defendant would not appear voluntarily, he could require their
attendance through the subpoena power of the court.

(d) Ata trial, Defendant could rely on a privilege against self-incrimination and
decline to testify, and no inference of guilt could be drawn from such refusal
to testify. However, if Defendant desired to do so, he could testify on his
own behalf.

Factual Basis for Guilty Plea

12. Defendant is pleading guilty because he is guilty of the charges contained in Count
One of the Information. If this case were to proceed to trial, the United States could prove each
element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. The following facts, among others would be
offered to establish Defendantâs guilt:

âThe Foreign State Governmentâ was the government of one of the thirty-one states that
comprise Mexico.

âForeign Official 1â was an employee of The Foreign State Government with responsibility
for maintaining The Foreign State Governmentâs aircraft from at least in or around 2005 to in or
around December 2010.

âForeign Official 2â was an employee of The Foreign State Government with responsibility
for maintaining The Foreign State Governmentâs aircraft from in or around January 2011 through
at least in or around July 2016.

âAviation Corporation Aâ was a United States company, headquartered in Texas, which
provided maintenance, repair, overhaul, and related services to customers in the United States and
Mexico, including to The Foreign State Government.

DANIEL PEREZ (âPEREZâ) was a citizen of the United States and a resident of Texas.

PEREZ was the Director of Maintenance of Aviation Corporation A from in or around 1978
through at least in or around July 2016. PEREZ was an owner of Aviation Corporation A from
in or around 1993 through in or around 2010.

Kamta Ramnarine (âRamnarineââ) was a citizen of the United States and resident of Texas.
Ramnarine was an employee of Aviation Corporation A from in or around 1975 to at least in or
around July 2016. Ramnarine was the President of Aviation Corporation A from in or around
1993 to in or around 2010, and Ramnarine was the General Manager of Aviation Corporation A
from in or around 2010 through at least in or around July 2016. Ramnarine was an owner of
Aviation Corporation A from in or around 1993 through in or around 2010.

Between in or around 2007 and in or around April 2015, PEREZ, Ramnarine, and others
knowingly, willfully, and corruptly agreed to make payments, and caused Aviation Corporation A
to make payments, to employees of The Foreign State Government and instrumentalities of The
Foreign State Government, including Foreign Official 1 and Foreign Official 2, (collectively the
âForeign Officialsâ), to influence the Foreign Officials in their official capacity and to secure an
improper advantage for Aviation Corporation A in order to assist Aviation Corporation A in
obtaining and retaining business with The Foreign State Government and instrumentalities of The
Foreign State Government.

In furtherance of the bribe scheme, PEREZ, Ramnarine, and others caused Aviation
Corporation A to make corrupt payments to the Foreign Officials, including a corrupt payment in
the amount of approximately $35,000 from Aviation Corporation Aâs bank account in Texas in or
around December 22, 2010 to Foreign Official 1âs bank account in Texas. PEREZ knew it was
wrong to make the payments, and knew that the purpose of the corrupt payments was to influence
the Foreign Officials in their official capacity in order to improperly secure business with The

Foreign State Government and instrumentalities of The Foreign State Government. PEREZ
communicated with Ramnarine, the Foreign Officials, and others about the bribes, signed checks
that were paid to Foreign Official 1, and deposited bribe payments into a bank account controlled
by Foreign Official | in Texas.

Further, PEREZ, Ramnarine, Foreign Official 1, Foreign Official 2, and others took steps
to conceal the bribe scheme, including by hiding the amount of the bribe payments in invoices sent
to The Foreign State Government and instrumentalities of The Foreign State Government.

From in or around 2007 through in or around April 2015, PEREZ, Ramnarine, and others
knowingly, willfully, and corruptly conspired and agreed to cause Aviation Corporation A to make
bribe payments to the Foreign Officials totaling at least $665,000 in association with the bribery
scheme.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Tuesday, December 27, 2016

Four Businessmen and Two Foreign Officials Plead Guilty in Connection with Bribes Paid to
Mexican Aviation Officials

Charges were unsealed against six individuals, all of whom have pleaded guilty for their involvement in schemes to bribe Mexican officials in
order to secure aircraft maintenance and repair contracts with government-owned and controlled entities, and two for conspiring to launder the
proceeds of the schemes.

Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Kenneth Magidson of the Southern
District of Texas, Special Agent in Charge Mark Dawson of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcementâs Homeland Security Investigations (ICE-
HSI) in Houston, Special Agent in Charge Shane Folden of ICE-HSI in San Antonio and Special Agent in Charge Rick Goss of Internal Revenue
Service-Criminal Investigationâs (IRS-Cl) Houston Field Office made the announcement.

âThe six convictions announced today demonstrate the departmentâs commitment to holding accountable those who further official corruption
through bribery,â said Assistant Attorney General Caldwell. âThese convictions are the result of a coordinated effort by prosecutors and agents
who built the cases brick by brick using traditional law enforcement techniques.â

âHSI special agents and our law enforcement partners will continue to aggressively investigate financial crimes committed by corrupt foreign
officials,â said Special Agent in Charge Folden. âThis case serves as a reminder that HSI will use all its resources to identify, investigate and
dismantle these criminal networks wherever they operate.â

âThe individuals involved in this scheme paid millions of dollars in bribes to foreign officials in exchange for aviation contracts that placed
legitimate businesses at a significant competitive disadvantage,â said Special Agent in Charge Goss. âIRS-Clâs role in unraveling this scheme
assisted in facilitating the guilty pleas that were announced today.â

Douglas Ray, 55, of Magnolia, Texas, and Victor Hugo Valdez Pinon, 54, a citizen of Mexico, pleaded guilty on Oct. 28 and Oct. 26, 2016,
respectively, before U.S. District Judge Alfred H. Bennett of the Southern District of Texas to conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act (FCPA) and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Kamta Ramnarine, 69, and Daniel Perez, 69, both of Brownsville, Texas, both pleaded guilty on
Nov. 2, 2016, before U.S. District Judge Ricardo H. Hinojosa of the Southern District of Texas to one count of conspiring to violate the FCPA.
Ramnarine and Perez are scheduled to be sentenced on Jan. 30, 2017. Ray and Valdez Pinon are scheduled to be sentenced Feb. 23, 2016.

Ernesto Hernandez Montemayor, 55, and Ramiro Ascencio Nevarez, 58, both of whom are citizens of Mexico and were previous officials of
Mexican state government entities, each pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. Hernandez Montemayor
pleaded guilty before Judge Bennett on Dec. 9, 2015, and is scheduled to be sentenced on Jan. 12, 2017. Nevarez pleaded guilty before Judge
Hinojosa on March 4, 2016, and was sentenced to 15 months in prison on May 27, 2016.

According to the defendantsâ plea agreements, between 2006 and 2016, Ray conspired with Valdez and others to bribe Mexican officials. The
defendants and their co-conspirators, who owned or were associated with companies in the United States that provided aircraft maintenance,
repair, overhaul and related services to customers from the United States and Mexico, paid the bribes in order to secure parts and servicing
contracts with Mexican government-owned customers. Ray agreed to pay bribes to at least seven different foreign officials, including
Hernandez Montemayor, sometimes paying the bribes via wire transfer and checks to accounts in the United States controlled by the officials.
As part of his guilty plea, Hernandez Montemayor admitted that while employed by a Mexican state government, he accepted bribes from Ray,
Ramnarine, Perez and others in exchange for taking certain actions to assist companies they owned in winning business with Hernandez
Montemayorâs state government employer. Hernandez Montemayor also admitted that he conspired with Ray, Ramnarine, Perez and others to
launder the proceeds of the bribery scheme.

Ramnarine and Perez admitted that, in addition to bribing Hernandez Montemayor, they also conspired to pay bribes to several other foreign
officials between 2007 and 2015 to ensure that their Brownsville-based company won aircraft parts and services contracts with Mexican
government-owned customers. As part of his guilty plea, Nevarez admitted that while employed by a Mexican public university, he accepted
bribes from Ramnarine and Perez in exchange for taking certain actions to assist their company in winning business with the university.
Nevarez also admitted that he conspired with Ramnarine, Perez and others to launder the proceeds of the bribery scheme.

In total, Ray, Valdez Pinon, Ramnarine, Perez and their co-conspirators paid more than $2 million in bribes to Mexican officials, including
Hernandez Montemayor and Nevarez, in order to secure aviation maintenance, repair and overhaul contracts.

ICE-HSI and IRS-CI are investigating the case. Trial Attorneys Christopher Cestaro and Kevin R. Gingras of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section
and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jesse Salazar and Arthur Jones of the Southern District of Texas are prosecuting the case. The Criminal Division's
Office of International Affairs also provided significant assistance.

The Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the

departmentâs FCPA enforcement efforts can be found at www. justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.

Re: United States v. Daren Condrey, 26)

Criminal No. TDC-15-0336 or WBA

Dear Mr. Bonsib:

This letter, together with the Sealed Supplement, confirms the plea agreement which has
been offered to the Defendant by the United States Attomeyâs Office for the District of Maryland
and the Fraud Section, Criminal Division, United States Department of Justice (âthis Officeâ). If
the Defendant accepts this offer, please have him execute it in the spaces provided below. If this
offer has not been accepted by June 5, 2015, it will be deemed withdrawn. The terms of the
agreement are as follows:

Offense of Conviction

1. The Defendant agrees to waive indictment and plead guilty to @ one-count
criminal Information, charging him with one count of Conspiracy to Violate the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act (*FCPAâ) and to Commit Wire Fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. Â§ 371. The
Defendant admits that he is, in fact, guilty of this offense and will so advise the Court.

EJements of the Offense

2. The elements of the offense to which the Defendant has agreed to plead guilty,
and which this Office would prove if the case went to trial, are as follows:

a. the Defendant and at least one other person entered an unlawful
agreement;

b. the Defendant knowingly and willfully became a member of the
conspiracy;
 

 

c. at least one of the members of the conspiracy knowingly committed at
least one overt act; and

d. the overt act was committed to further some objective of the conspiracy.
Penalties
2. The maximum sentence provided by statute for the offense to which the

Defendant is pleading guilty is imprisonment for a term of not more than five years, supervised
release of up to three years, and a fine of not more than $250,000 or twice the gain or loss
associated with the offense. In addition, the Defendant must pay $100 as a special assessment
pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Â§ 3013, which will be due and should be paid at or before the time of
sentencing. This Court may also order him to make restitution pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 3663,
3663A, and 3664. If a fine or restitution is imposed, it shall be payable immediately, unless,
pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Â§ 3572(d), the Court orders otherwise.â The Defendant understands that if
he serves a term of imprisonment, is released on supervised release, and then violates the
conditions of his supervised release, his supervised release could be revoked - even on the last
day of the term - and the Defendant could be returned to custody to serve another period of
incarceration and a new term of supervised release. The Defendant understands that the Bureau
of Prisons has sole discretion in designating the institution at which the Defendant will serve any
term of imprisonment imposed.

Waiver of Rights

4, The Defendant understands that by entering into this agreement, he surrenders
certain rights as outlined below:

a. If the Defendant had persisted in his plea of not guilty, he would have had
the right to a speedy jury trial with the close assistance of competent counsel. That trial could be
conducted by a judge, without a jury, if the Defendant, this Office, and the Court all agreed.

b. If the Defendant elected a jury trial, the jury would be composed of twelve
individuals selected from the community. Counsel and the Defendant would have the
opportunity to challenge prospective jurors who demonstrated bias or who were otherwise
unqualified, and would have the opportunity to strike a certain number of jurors peremptorily.
All twelve jurors would have to agree unanimously before the Defendant could be found guilty
of any count. The jury would be instructed that the Defendant was presumed to be innocent, and
that presumption could be overcome only by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

e If the Defendant went to trial, the government would have the burden of
proving the Defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The Defendant would have the right to
confront and cross-examine the governmentâs witnesses. The Defendant would not have to

 

' Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Â§ 3612, if the Court imposes a fine in excess of $2,500 that remains
unpaid 15 days after it is imposed, the Defendant shall be charged interest on that fine, unless the
Court modifies the interest payment in accordance with 18 U.S.C. Â§ 3612(f)(3).
 

present any defense witnesses or evidence whatsoever. If the Defendant wanted to call witnesses
in his defense, however, he would have the subpoena power of the Court to compel the witnesses
to attend.

d. The Defendant would have the right to testify in his own defense if he so
chose, and he would have the right to refuse to testify. If he chose not to testify, the Court could
instruct the jury that they could not draw any adverse inference from his decision not to testify.

e. If the Defendant were found guilty after a trial, he would have the right to
appeal the verdict and the Courtâs pretrial and trial decisions on the admissibility of evidence to
see if any errors were committed which would require a new trial or dismissal of the charges
against him. By pleading guilty, the Defendant knowingly gives up the right to appeal the
verdict and the Courtâs decisions.

f. By pleading guilty, the Defendant will be giving up all of these rights,
except the right, under the limited circumstances set forth in the âWaiver of Appealâ paragraph
below, to appeal the sentence. By pleading guilty, the Defendant understands that he may have
to answer the Courtâs questions both about the rights he is giving up and about the facts of his
case. Any statements the Defendant makes during such a hearing would not be admissible
against him during a trial except in a criminal proceeding for perjury or false statement.

g. If the Court accepts the Defendantâs plea of guilty, there will be no further
trial or proceeding of any kind, and the Court will find him guilty.

h. By pleading guilty, the Defendant will also be giving up certain valuable
civil rights and may be subject to deportation or other loss of immigration status. The Defendant
recognizes that if he is not a citizen of the United States, pleading guilty may have consequences
with respect to his immigration status. Under federal law, conviction for a broad range of crimes
can lead to adverse immigration consequences, including automatic removal from the United
States. Removal and other immigration consequences are the subject of a separate proceeding,
however, and the Defendant understands that no one, including his attorney or the Court, can
predict with certainty the effect of a conviction on immigration status. Defendant nevertheless
affirms that he wants to plead guilty regardless of any potential immigration consequences.

Advisory Sentencing Guidelines Apply

 

ai The Defendant understands that the Court will determine a sentencing guidelines
range for this case (henceforth the âadvisory guidelines rangeâ) pursuant to the Sentencing
Reform Act of 1984 at 18 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 3551-3742 (excepting 18 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 3553(b)(1) and 3742(e))
and 28 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 991 through 998. The Defendant further understands that the Court will
impose a sentence pursuant to the Sentencing Reform Act, as excised, and must take into account
the advisory guidelines range in establishing a reasonable sentence.
Factual and Advisory Guidelines Stipulation

6. This Office and the Defendant understand, agree and stipulate to the Statement of
Facts set forth in Attachment A hereto, which this Office would prove beyond a reasonable
doubt, and set forth the following agreed-upon and disputed applicable sentencing guidelines
factors:

a. The base offense level is 12, pursuant to U.S.S.G. Â§Â§2X1.1 and
2C1.1(a)(2).

b. The offense level is increased by 2 levels, pursuant to Â§ 2C1.1(b)(1),
because there was more than one bribe.

c. The value of the payment or the benefit received or to be received will be
established at sentencing and the offense level will be further increased, pursuant to
Â§Â§ 2C1.1(b)(2) and 2B1.1(b)(1). The offense level increase will not be less than 16 levels,
pursuant to Â§Â§ 2C1.1(b)(2) and 2B1.1(b)(1)(D, because the value of the payment is more than $1
million. Further, the offense level will not be more than 24 levels, pursuant to Â§Â§ 2C1.1(b)(2)
and 2B1.1(b)(1)(M), because the value of the benefit received or to be received will not be more
than $100 million.

d. The adjusted offense level will be established at sentencing, but will not
be less than 30 nor greater than 38.

zB This Office does not oppose a 2 level reduction in the Defendantâs
adjusted offense level, based upon the Defendant's recognition and affirmative acceptance of
personal responsibility for his criminal conduct. This Office agrees to make a motion pursuant to
U.S.S.G. Â§ 3E1.1(b) for an additional 1 level decrease in recognition of the Defendant's timely
notification of his intention to plead guilty. This Office may oppose any adjustment for
acceptance of responsibility if the Defendant (a) fails to admit each and every item in the factual
stipulation; (b) denies involvement in the offense; (c) gives conflicting statements about his
involvement in the offense; (d) is untruthful with the Court, this Office, or the United States
Probation Office; (e) obstructs or attempts to obstruct justice prior to sentencing; (f) engages in
any criminal conduct between the date of this agreement and the date of sentencing; or (g)
attempts to withdraw his plea of guilty. The final offense level will be established at sentencing,
but will be between 27 and 35.

Zz The Defendant understands that there is no agreement as to his criminal history or
criminal history category, and that his criminal history could alter his offense level if he is a
career offender or if the instant offense was a part of a pattern of criminal conduct from which he
derived a substantial portion of his income.

8. This Office and the Defendant agree that with respect to the calculation of the
advisory guidelines range, with the exception of establishing the offense level increase for the
value of the benefit received or to be received at sentencing, no other offense characteristics,
sentencing guidelines factors, potential departures or adjustments set forth in the United States
Sentencing Guidelines will be raised or are in dispute. Ifthe Defendant intends to argue for any
factor that could take the sentence outside of the advisory guidelines range, he will notify the
Court, the United States Probation Officer and government counsel at least 14 days in advance of
sentencing of the facts or issues he intends to raise.

Obligations of this Office
9. At the time of sentencing, this Office will recommend a reasonable sentence.

10. The parties reserve the right to bring to the Courtâs attention at the time of
sentencing, and the Court will be entitled to consider, all relevant information concerning the
Defendantâs background, character and conduct.

Waiver of Appeal

11. In exchange for the concessions made by this Office and the Defendant in this
plea agreement, this Office and the Defendant waive their rights to appeal as follows:

a. The Defendant knowingly waives all right, except his right to effective
assistance of counsel, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1291 or otherwise, to appeal the Defendantâs
conviction;

b. The Defendant and this Office knowingly waive all right, pursuant to 18
U.S.C. Â§ 3742 or otherwise, to appeal whatever sentence is imposed (including the right to
appeal any issues that relate to the establishment of the advisory guidelines range, the
determination of the defendantâs criminal history, the weighing of the sentencing factors, and the
decision whether to impose and the calculation of any term of imprisonment, fine, order of
forfeiture, order of restitution, and term or condition of supervised release), except as follows:
(i) the Defendant reserves the right to appeal any term of imprisonment to the extent that it
exceeds any sentence within the advisory guidelines resulting from an adjusted base offense
level 35, and (ii) this Office reserves the right to appeal any term of imprisonment to the extent
that it is below any sentence within the advisory guidelines range resulting from an adjusted base
offense level 27.

C. Nothing in this agreement shall be construed to prevent the Defendant or
this Office from invoking the provisions of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(a), or from
appealing from any decision thereunder, should a sentence be imposed that resulted from
arithmetical, technical, or other clear error.

d. The Defendant waives any and all rights under the Freedom of
Information Act relating to the investigation and prosecution of the above-captioned matter and
agrees not to file any request for documents from this Office or any investigating agency.
 

 

Obstruction or Other Violations of Law

12. The Defendant agrees that he will not commit any offense in violation of federal,
state or local law between the date of this agreement and his sentencing in this case. In the event
that the Defendant (i) engages in conduct after the date of this agreement which would justify a
finding of obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G. Â§ 3Cl.1, or (ii) fails to accept personal
responsibility for his conduct by failing to acknowledge his guilt to the probation officer who
prepares the Presentence Report, or (iii) commits any offense in violation of federal, state or
local law, then this Office will be relieved of its obligations to the Defendant as reflected in this
agreement. Specifically, this Office will be free to argue sentencing guidelines factors other than
those stipulated in this agreement, and it will also be free to make sentencing recommendations
other than those set out in this agreement. As with any alleged breach of this agreement, this
Office will bear the burden of convincing the Court of the Defendantâs obstructive or unlawful
behavior and/or failure to acknowledge personal responsibility by a preponderance of the
evidence. The Defendant acknowledges that he may not withdraw his guilty plea because this
Office is relieved of its obligations under the agreement pursuant to this paragraph.

Court Not a Party

13. | The Defendant expressly understands that the Court is not a party to this
agreement. In the federal system, the sentence to be imposed is within the sole discretion of the
Court. In particular, the Defendant understands that neither the United States Probation Office
nor the Court is bound by the stipulation set forth above, and that the Court will, with the aid of
the Presentence Report, determine the facts relevant to sentencing. The Defendant understands
that the Court cannot rely exclusively upon the stipulation in ascertaining the factors relevant to
the determination of sentence. Rather, in determining the factual basis for the sentence, the
Court will consider the stipulation, together with the results of the presentence investigation, and
any other relevant information. The Defendant understands that the Court is under no obligation
to accept this Officeâs recommendations, and the Court has the power to impose a sentence up to
and including the statutory maximum stated above. The Defendant understands that if the Court
ascertains factors different from those contained in the stipulation set forth above, or if the Court
should impose any sentence up to the maximum established by statute, the Defendant cannot, for
that reason alone, withdraw his guilty plea, and will remain bound to fulfill all of his obligations
under this agreement. The Defendant understands that neither the prosecutor, his counsel, nor
the Court can make a binding prediction, promise, or representation as to what guidelines range
or sentence the Defendant will receive. The Defendant agrees that no one has made such a
binding prediction or promise.
 

 

 

 

Entire Agreement

14. This agreement supersedes any prior understandings, promises, or conditions
between this Office and the Defendant and constitutes the complete plea agreement in this case.
The Defendant acknowledges that there are no other agreements, promises, undertakings or
understandings between the Defendant and this Office other than those set forth in this
agreement and none will be entered into unless in writing and signed by all parties.

If the Defendant fully accepts each and every term and condition of this letter,
please sign and have the Defendant sign the original and return it to me promptly.

If this matter had proceeded to tial, the government would have proven the following â*r
facts beyond a reasonable doubt, The parties agree that the following facts do not encompass ail
of the facts that would have been proven had this matter proceeded to trial.

DAREN CONDREY (âCONDREY"") was a citizen of the United States and resident of
Maryland. CONDREY was an owner and executive of Transportation Corporation A from in or
about August 1998 through in or about October 2014. CONDREY was the co-President of
Transportation Corporation A from in or about January 2010 through in or about October 2014.
Thus, CONDREY was a âdomestic concertâ and an officer, employee and agent of a âdomestic
concern,â as that term is used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2(h)(1).

âTransportation Corporation A was United States company headquartered in Maryland,
and thus a âdomestic concern,â as that term is used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code,
Section 78dd-2(h)(1)(B). Transportation Corporation A was in the business of providing
logistical support services for the transportation of nuclear materials to customers in the United
States and to foreign customers, These foreign customers included JSC Techsnabexport
(âTENEXâ).

âTENEX supplied uranium and uranium enrichment services to nuclear power companies
throughout the world on behalf of the government of the Russian Federation. TENEX was
indirectly owned and controlled by, and performed functions of, the government of the Russian
Federation, and thus was an âagencyâ and âinstrumentalityâ of a foreign government, as those
terms are used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, 78dd-2(h)(2).

TENEX established a wholly-owned subsidiary company located in the United States in
or about October 2010, TENAM Corporation (*TENAMâ). TENAM was TENEXâs official
representative office in the United States, TENAM was indirectly owned and controlled by, and
performed functions of, the government of the Russian Federation, and thus was an âagencyâ and
âinstrumentalityâ of a foreign government, as those terms are used in the FCPA, Title 15, United
States Code, 78dd-2(h\(2).

Foreign Official One, a national of the Russian Federation, was a Director of TENEX
from at least 2004 through in or about October 2010, and was the President of TENAM from in
or about October 2010 through in or about October 2014. Foreign Official One was a âforeign
official,â as that term is used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2(h)(2).
From in or about December 2011 through in or about October 2014, Foreign Official One was a
resident of Maryland.

Co-Conspirator One was an owner and executive of Transportation Corporation A. from
in or about 1998 to in of about December 2009, and a consultant to Transportation Corporation
A from in or about January 2010 through io or about 2011
Cylinder Corporation A was a company, based in Ohio, which engaged in the
manufacture of tanks and vessels for the oil and gas, nuclear, and marine markets. Cylinder
Corporation A secured contracts with TENEX to supply storage and transportation cylinders. In
or about September 2012, Cylinder Corporation A was acquired by another company
headquartered in Ohio (âOhio Corporationâ).

Between in or about 2004 through in or about 2014, in the District of Maryland and
elsewhere, CONDREY knowingly combined, conspired, confederated, and agreed with others to
commit offenses against the United States, namely to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
(âFCPAâ), in violation of 15 U.S.C. Â§ 78dd-2, and to commit wire fraud, in violation of 18
U.S.C. Â§ 1343, all in violation of 18 U.S.C. Â§ 371. Specifically, CONDREY and other co-
conspirators, including Co-Conspirator One, agreed to make payments, and caused
Transportation Corporation A to make payments, at the direction of, and for the benefit of,
Foreign Official One in order to obtain and retain business with TENEX. Further, in order to
effectuate the bribe payments to Foreign Official One, CONDREY and other co-conspirators
obtained the money used to pay the bribes by inflating the prices Transportation Corporation A
charged TENEX for services, thereby depriving TENEX of money and property, in violation of
18 U.S.C. Â§ 1343.

In furtherance of the conspiracy, and to effect the objects of the conspiracy, CONDREY
and other co-conspirators discussed making bribe payments with Foreign Official One in person
and via electronic mail (âemailâ). For example, on or about October 30, 2013, CONDREY sent
an email to Foreign Official One with the subject âLFâ that attached the details of a payment that
was made in furtherance of the scheme. The terms âLF,â âlucky figure,â âcake,â and
âremunerationâ were code words used by CONDREY and others to describe the bribe payments
that were promised and made to Foreign Official One.

In order to make the bribe payments to Foreign Official One, CONDREY and other co-
conspirators caused Transportation Corporation A to make payments to offshore bank accounts
at the direction of, and for the benefit of, Foreign Official One, including a wire transfer in the
amount of $77,896 from Transportation Corporation Aâs bank account in Maryland on October
30, 2013, to a bank account located in Zurich, Switzerland. CONDREY knew it was wrong to
make, and agree to make, the bribe payments. CONDREY also knew that the bribe payments
were made for the benefit of Foreign Official One, and the payments were promised, and made,
in order to influence Foreign Official One in his official capacity and to secure an improper
advantage for Transportation Corporation A.

Further, as part of the conspiracy, CONDREY and other co-conspirators caused
Transportation Corporation A to increase the prices it charged TENEX by the amount of the
bribe payments promised to Foreign Official One. CONDREY and other co-conspirators sent,
and caused Transportation Corporation A to send, quotations and invoices to TENEX that hid the
cost of the bribe payments promised to Foreign Official One within the total of Transportation
Corporation Aâs pricing. While keeping the bribe costs hidden from TENEX, CONDREY sent
emails to Foreign Official One regarding the amount of the bribe payments that were promised
and paid in furtherance of the scheme.
 

 

CONDREY and others also caused Transportation Corporation A to act as an
intermediary for a payment Ohio Corporation made for the benefit of Foreign Official One.
Specifically, on or about November 29, 2013, Ohio Corporation made a payment to
Transportation Corporation A in the amount of $30,900 with the understanding that
Transportation Corporation A would send the money to an account at the direction of Foreign
Official One. Shortly afterwards, on or about December 16, 2013, Transportation Corporation A
sent a wire transfer in the amount of $57,713.42 from Transportation Corporation Aâs bank
account in Maryland to a bank account in Zurich, Switzerland, that included the payment Ohio
Corporation made for the benefit of Foreign Official One, minus a fee, in addition to a payment
Transportation Corporation A made for the benefit of Foreign Official One.

From 2004 through 2014, CONDREY and other co-conspirators caused Transportation
Corporation A to make bribe payments for the benefit of Foreign Official One totaling more than
$1,000,000 in association with the bribery scheme involving Transportation Corporation A.

Russian Nuclear Energy Official Pleads Guilty to Money Laundering Conspiracy Involving
Violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act

U.S. Conspirators Paid Over $2 Million to Influence Russian Nuclear Energy Official and to Secure Business with State-Owned Russian Nuclear
Energy Company

A Russian official residing in Maryland pleaded guilty today to conspiracy to commit money laundering in connection with his role in arranging
over $2 million in corrupt payments to influence the awarding of contracts with the Russian state-owned nuclear energy corporation.

Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Rod J. Rosenstein of the District of
Maryland, Deputy Inspector General John R. Hartman of the U.S. Department of Energy-Office of Inspector General (DOE-OIG) and Assistant
Director in Charge Andrew G. McCabe of the FBIâs Washington, D.C., Field Office made the announcement.

Vadim Mikerin, 56, of Chevy Chase, Maryland, pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Theodore D. Chuang of the District of Maryland.
Sentencing is scheduled before Judge Chuang on Dec. 8, 2015.

According to court documents, Mikerin was the president of TENAM Corporation and a director of the Pan American Department of JSC
Techsnabexport (TENEX). TENAM, based in Bethesda, Maryland, is a wholly-owned subsidiary and the official representative of TENEX in the
United States. TENEX, based in Moscow, acts as the sole supplier and exporter of Russian Federation uranium and uranium enrichment services
to nuclear power companies worldwide. TENEX is a subsidiary of Russiaâs State Atomic Energy Corporation.

In connection with the scheme, Daren Condrey, 50, of Glenwood, Maryland, pleaded guilty on June 17, 2015, to conspiring to violate the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and conspiring to commit wire fraud, and will be sentenced on Nov. 2, 2015. Boris Rubizhevsky, 64, of Closter,
New Jersey, pleaded guilty on June 15, 2015, to conspiracy to commit money laundering and will be sentenced on Oct. 19, 2015.

According to court documents, between 2004 and October 2014, Mikerin conspired with Condrey, Rubizhevsky and others to transmit funds
from Maryland and elsewhere in the United States to offshore shell company bank accounts located in Cyprus, Latvia and Switzerland. Mikerin
admitted the funds were transmitted with the intent to promote a corrupt payment scheme that violated the FCPA. Specifically, he admitted
that the corrupt payments were made by conspirators to influence Mikerin and to secure improper business advantages for U.S. companies that
did business with TENEX. Mikerin further admitted that he and others used consulting agreements and code words such as âlucky figure,â âLF,â
âcakeâ and âremunerationâ to disguise the corrupt payments.

According to court documents, over the course of the scheme, Mikerin conspired with Condrey, Rubizhevsky and others to transfer
approximately $2,126,622 from the United States to offshore shell company bank accounts. As part of his plea agreement, Mikerin has agreed
to the entry of a forfeiture money judgment in that amount.

The case was investigated by DOE-OIG and the FBI. The case is being prosecuted by Trial Attorneys Christopher Cestaro, Ephraim Wernick and
Derek Ettinger of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys David |. Salem and Michael T. Packard of the District of
Maryland.

(a) Defendant has a right to have the United States Attorney present
the charges in the Information to a Grand Jury consisting of not less
than sixteen (16) nor more than twenty-three (23) impartial citizens,
who would hear the facts of the case as presented by the United States

defendant only if twelve (12) or more members of the Grand Jury found
that there was probable cause to believe the defendant committed the
crime charged in the Criminal Information.

(b) If Defendant persisted in a plea of not guilty to the charges,
Defendant would have the right to a speedy jury trial with the assistance
of counsel. The trial may be conducted by a judge sitting without a

Factual Basis for Guilty Plea

16. Defendant is pleading guilty because he is in fact guilty of the charge

contained in Count One of the Information. If this case were to proceed to trial, the

United States could prove each element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.

The following facts, among others, would be offered to establish Defendantâs guilt:

10

 
Case 4:16-cr-00437 DocumentiO Filed on iQ/17/i6 in TXSD Page 21 of 20

At all relevant times, Defendant was the owner of a number of U.S.-based
energy companies that supplied equipment and services to Petroleos de Venezuela
S.A. (ââPDVSAâ), the Venezuelan state-owned and state-controlled oil company, or
to wholly-owned subsidiaries or affiliates thereof. PDVSA, together with its
subsidiaries and affiliates, was responsible for the exploration, production, refining,
transportation, and trade in energy resources in Venezuela and provided funding for
other operations of the Venezuelan government. Bariven, S.A. (âBarivenâ) was the
procurement subsidiary of PDVSA.

From in or about 2009 to in or about 2014, Defendant agreed with others to

pay bribes and other things of value te PDVSA officials in order to obtain or retain

businessâwith PDVSA and to engage in titiariCial transactions to concear thenaturÃ©,

source, and ownership of the bribe proceeds. Specifically, Defendant agreed to, and
did, pay bribes to PDVSA officials in exchange for their assistance to Defendant and
his companies, in helping them win PDVSA contracts, including providing
Defendant with inside information concerning the PDVSA bidding process, placing
Defendantâs companies on the bidding panels for certain PDVSA contracts and
assisting Defendantâs companies in receiving payment for previously awarded
PDVSA contracts, among other things. Defendant understood that the bribe

payments were made in part to continue the relationship with the officials and that

1]

 
Case 416-cr-00437 DocumentiO Filed on iQ/17/i6 in TXSD Page 22 of 20

the officials would continue to provide assistance in the future with regard to future

PDVSA contracts. Defendant provided things of value to PDVSA officials in

exchange for their assistance to Defendantâs companies, including money, gifts, -.

meals, and recreational travel.

Defendant, or others working at Defendantâs direction, made the bribe
payments by writing checks or wiring money from various bank accounts controlled
by Defendant, his companies, and a relative of Defendantâs to various bank accounts
in the United States and abroad in the names of PDVSA officials, companies
controlled by PDVSA officials, or relatives or friends of PDVSA officials.

Frequently, Defendant and his co-conspirators used fake invoices to provide false

engage in financial transactions that were designed to conceal the nature, source, and
ownership of the bribe proceeds.

One of the PDVSA officials with whom Defendant reached a bribery and
money laundering agreement was Jose Luis Ramos Castillo (âRAMOSâ).
Defendant reached an agreement to pay RAMOS in exchange for RAMOSâs
assistance in awarding business to Defendantâs companies. Defendant further
agreed with RAMOS to make payments to other PDVSA officials through RAMOS

in order to conceal the nature and source of those payments. On or about May 22,

12

 
eee

Case &i6-cr-O00437 DocumentiO Filed on TOv17/1G6in TXSD Page 13 of 20

2012, Defendant caused $682,000 to be transferred from a U.S. bank account in the
name of a company owned by Defendant to a U.S. bank account in the name of a
company that RAMOS owned with-a:relative in exchange for RAMOSâs-assistance
in awarding PDVSA contracts to companies owned by Defendant.

Another of the PDVSA officials with whom Defendant reached a bribery and
money laundering agreement was referred to in the information as âOfficial F.â
Defendant reached an agreement to pay Official F in exchange for Official Fâs
assistance in awarding contracts to Defendantâs companies and giving payment
priority to Defendantâs companies ahead of other PDVSA vendors with outstanding

invoices. On or about August 20, 2012, Defendant caused $50,000 to be wired from

âa U.S? bank account in*thÃ© namÃ© of a relative of Defendatit to a U:S: bank account

in the name of a relative of Official F in exchange for Official Fâs assistance in
awarding PDVSA contracts to companies owned by Defendant and giving payment
priority to companies owned by Defendant ahead of other PDVSA vendors with
outstanding invoices.

Overview of the Criminal Schemes

7. PARRIS, MIREMBE, and their co-conspirators engaged in, among other things, a
criminal scheme to offer and pay bribes to Ugandan judges, Ugandan welfare officers, and other
Ugandan officials to corruptly procure adoptions of Ugandan children in order to assist Adoption
Agency with obtaining business and with directing business to Adoption Agency, MIREMBE, and

others. PARRIS, MIREMBE, and their co-conspirators also lied to, and concealed material

 
a: D2 O-crfi0424-SO Doc #1 Filed: OS/t

   

information from, Adoption Agency clientsâincluding concealing facts relating to the
circumstances of the children to be adopted and concealing that the adoptions were procured
through bribery and fraudâin order to obtain money from Adoption Agency clients. PARRIS,
MIREMBE, and their co-conspirators also caused Adoption Agencyâs clients to submit fraudulent
visa applications to the United States Department of State (the âState Departmentâ) in connection
with certain adoptions. .

8. PARRIS, COLE, and their co-conspirators engaged in, among other things, a
criminal scheme to deceive authorities in the United States responsible for regulating intercountry
adoptions about a scheme to transfer a child from Poland to PARRISâs relatives without verifying
that PARRISâs relatives were eligible for intercountry adoption. COLE also lied to the Polish

âauthority responsible for intercountry adoptions about the transfer of the child to PARRISâs
relatives in an attempt to maintain Adoption Agencyâs ability to procure intercountry adoptions
from Poland.â

Relevant Laws and Regulations

9. The Intercountry Adoption Act (âIAAâ) made it a crime for any person to
knowingly and willfully make a false statement or misrepresentation about a material fact that is
intended to influence a decision or action of an accrediting entity or an entity performing a central
authority function in the United States or a foreign country. 42 U.S.C. Section 14944.

10, Adoption regulations further required that adoption agencies: (1) ensure that
intercountry adoptions take place in the best interests of children; and (2) prevent the abduction,
exploitation, sale, or trafficking of children. 22 C.F.R. Section 96.35.

ll. The State Department had primary responsibility for adjudicating the visa

applications of children coming to the United, States in intercountry adoption. Through the visa

 
Case: LipO-cr-00424-S0 Doc #1 Filled: 68/1

 

application review process, the State Department obtained information about how U.S. adoption
agencies facilitated intercountry adoptions from Uganda, Poland, and elsewhere. The State
Department could use this information to evaluate whether adoption agencies were complying with
applicable regulations, as appropriate.

12. The FCPA makes it unlawful for certain classes of persons and entities to act
corruptly in furtherance of an offer, promise, authorization, or payment of money or anything of
value to a foreign government official for the purpose of influencing foreign officials, inducing
foreign officials to take or omit certain acts, and securing an improper advantage in order to assist
those classes of persons in obtaining or retaining business for, or directing business to, any person.
15 U.S.C, Section 78dd-1, et seq.

Eligibility for Intercountry Adoption in Uganda

13. Ugandan laws provided, among other things, that children should only be separated
from their parents when a court determined that doing so would be beneficial to the child.
Probation and social welfare officers (âwelfare officersâ) in Uganda were responsible for
identifying vulnerable children and, when appropriate, applying for judicial âcare ordersâ that
would authorize persons other than a childâs parents to care for the child. To support a care order
application, welfare officers were required to interview the childâs parents, nearest relatives or
guardians and then submit a wtitten âwelfare reportâ describing why the child was vulnerable.

14. Magistrate Judges of the Family and Childrenâs Court of Uganda (âMagistrate
Judgesâ) were required to review the welfare report and determine whether to issue a care order

placing the child into an orphanage.

 
 

a: D2 O-crfi0424-SO Doc #1 Filed: O8/13/20 5 of 44.

   

Intercountry Adoption from Uganda to the United States

15. Prospective adoptive parents from the United States that sought to adopt Ugandan
orphans could do so by obtaining a guardianship order from the Family Division of the High Court
of Uganda (âUgandan High Courtâ), obtaining a visa to bring the child to the United States, and
then bringing the child to the United States to complete the adoption. At the Ugandan High Court,
the court registrar was responsible for assigning each guardianship application to a judge.

16. Guardianship applicants provided written submissions, including the welfare report
and care order, to support their applications. Ugandan High Court judges held hearings to
adjudicate guardianship applications and issued guardianship orders in writing. Once a
prospective adoptive parent obtained a guardianship order, he or she would then apply to the State
Department for an IR4 visa to bring the child to the United States. The prospective adoptive parent .
was typically interviewed at the U.S. Embassy in Kampala, Uganda in connection with their
prospective adopteeâs visa applications. The prospective adoptive parent was required, among
other things, to provide truthful information about the circumstances by which the child was
determined to be an orphan.

Details of the Uganda Criminal Schemes

17. In or around 2012, Adoption Agency started a program to facilitate adoptions of
Ugandan children by prospective adoptive parents in the United States. From at least 2012 to in
or around 2016, PARRIS managed Adoption Agencyâs adoption program in Uganda in
coordination with Longoria and others.

18. In or around 2013, Adoption Agency entered into an agreement with MIREMBE
to provide adoption-related services to Adoption Agency. PARRIS selected MIREMBE for this

role as Adoption Agencyâs foreign supervised provider in Uganda. Adoption Agency, through

 
 

a: D2 O-crf10424-SO Doc #1 Filed: OS/13/20 6 of 44.

   

PARRIS and others, communicated frequently with MIREMBE about her work for Adoption
Agency while it was in progress and provided her with instructions regarding the intercountry
adoptions that she was facilitating for Adoption Agency clients. Adoption Agency, through
PARRIS and others, directed its clients in the Uganda program to hire MIREMBE as their attorney
for adoption-related proceedings. Adoption Agency, through PARRIS and others, also supervised
MIREMBEâs work, including by requiring her to provide detailed descriptions of the services she
performed before receiving payment. Furthermore, federal regulations required Adoption Agency
to adequately supervise MIREMBE or risk being debarred by the State Department.

19. Between in or around 2013 and in or around 2016, PARRIS, MIREMBE, and others
participated in criminal schemes (1) to bribe Ugandan government officials in order to corruptly
procure adoptions of Ugandan children who PARRIS and MIREMBE knew had not been properly
determined to be orphans or otherwise to be eligible for intercountry adoption; (2) to make material
misrepresentations and to conceal material facts from Adoption Agency clients in order to obtain
money from Adoption Agency clients, including, among other things, to conceal from Adoption
Agency clients facts relating to the circumstances of the children to be adopted and the fact that
PARRIS, MIREMBE, and their co-conspirators were procuring these adoptions through bribery
and other improper means; (3) to wire money from the United States to Uganda, in part, to provide
money for the bribes; and (4) to cause Adoption Agencyâs clients to submit fraudulent visa
applications in connection with these adoptions. Many of the Ugandan children whose adoptions
PARRIS and MIREMBE had procured through bribery and fraud were not properly determined to
be orphans, and certain of the children were ultimately returned to their birth mothers in Uganda
after Adoption Agencyâs clients came to believe that these birth mothers had not knowingly given

their children up for adoption. During this same period, Adoption Agency, in collaboration with

 

 
 

Case: LipO-cr-00424-S0 Doc 1 Filled: O8/13feÂ¢

 

MIREMBE, procured the adoption of more than 30 Ugandan children by U.S. clients. Adoption
Agency received more than $900,000 from these clients. MIREMBE received more than $430,000
from Adoption Agency, as well as tens of thousands of dollars directly from Adoption Agencyâs
clients for representing them in Uganda.
PARRIS, MIREMBE, and their Co-Conspirators bribe Ugandan officials

20. PARRIS, MIREMBE, and their co-conspirators presented Ugandan children who
had not yet been determined to be orphans to Adoption Agencyâs clients for potential adoption.
PARRIS then authorized Adoption Agency to send funds to MIREMBE, knowing that MIREMBE
would use these funds, in part, to bribe Ugandan government officials to corruptly cause the
adoptions of these children. These bribes included bribes to the following individuals, each of
whom was a âforeign officialâ as that term is used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code,
Sections 78dd-2(h)(2)(A): (1) bribes to a welfare officer, so that the welfare officer would
recommend that children be placed into orphanages without first ensuring that the children were
actually orphaned or that putting them up-for adoption was in their best interest; (2) bribes to a
Ugandan magistrate judge, so that the magistrate judge would issue care orders based on the
corruptly procured welfare reports and place the children in an orphanage in the Kampala district
of Uganda (âKampala Orphanage Aâ) that was willing to accept the children without inquiring
into whether they were actually orphans; (3) bribes to court registrars to get them to assign cases
to corrupt âadoption-friendlyâ judges; and (4) bribes to Ugandan High Court judges to obtain
guardianship orders to permit Adoption Agencyâs clients to bring the children to the United States
for adoption.

21. For example, MIREMBE and others working at MIREMBEâs direction used

money from Adoption Agency to pay bribes to a welfare officer in the Kayunga district of Uganda
 

Case: LipO-cr-00424-S0 Doct: 1 Filed: O8/13feÂ¢ Pp.

 

(âKayunga Welfare Officer 1â) in exchange for Kayunga Welfare Officer 1 signing welfare reports
that recommended placing children into an orphanage. These corruptly procured welfare reports
were not based on Kayunga Welfare Officer 1âs independent determinations that these children
had to be placed in an orphanage. Rather, as PARRIS and MIREMBE knew and intended,
Kayunga Welfare Officer 1 provided welfare reports for these children because MIREMBE and
people working at MIREMBEâs direction brought the children to Kayunga Welfare Officer 1 and
paid bribes to Kayunga Welfare Officer 1 t6 corruptly obtain the welfare reports.

22. MIREMBE, at times assisted by employees of Law Firm A who were working at
her direction, drafted welfare reports and directed the employees to deliver them to Kayunga
Welfare Officer 1. Kayunga Welfare Officer | signed the welfare reports prepared by MIREMBE
and the Law Firm A employees upon receiving cash bribes. These welfare reports at times falsely
overstated the childrenâs need for care and orphan status. For example, one welfare report falsely
and fraudulently stated that the whereabouts of a childâs father were unknown.

23. In many instances, these welfare reports also often recommended that the children
be placed in âKampala Orphanage A,â even though it was in the Kampala district of Uganda,
which was approximately two hours away from the Kayunga districtâthe district that the children
were from and where there were available orphanages. -MIREMBE steered the children to
Kampala Orphanage A because MIREMBE knew that the director of Kampala Orphanage A
would accept the children without scrutinizing whether the children had any alternatives for care.
MIREMBE also steered the children to Kampala Orphanage A because the director of Kampala
Orphanage A was willing to sign affidavits drafted by MIREMBE for submission to the Ugandan

High Court without questioning them.

 

 
 

Case: LipO-cr-00424-S0 Doct: 1 Filed: O8/13feÂ¢ Pp.

 

24. PARRIS, MIREMBE and their co-conspirators caused Adoption Agency to wire
funds from the Adoption Agencyâs Ohio-based account to bank accounts controlled by MIREMBE
in Uganda for the purpose of promoting the bribery scheme and knowing that the funds would be
used, in part, to fund the bribes to Ugandan officials. .

PARRIS, MIREMBE, and their Co-Conspirators provide false information to, and conceal
material information from, Adoption Agencyâs clients

25. PARRIS and MIREMBE and their co-conspirators took steps to conceal, among
other things: (1) the bribery scheme; (2) the fees associated with the bribery scheme that were
charged to Adoption Agency clients; and (3) other material facts from Adoption Agencyâs clients
in order to obtain money from Adoption Agency clients.

26. For example, Adoption Agency sent invoices via email to Adoption Agency clients
that falsely and fraudulently concealed the bribes to court registrars as âcourt filing fees.â
MIREMBE, and Law Firm A employees working at MIREMBEâs direction, also sent invoices to
Adoption Agency via email thatâ-as PARRIS, MIREMBE and their co-conspirators knewâ
falsely described bribes to Ugandan Judges as âjudgeâs fees.â

27. In or about October 2015, an Adoption Agency client asked PARRIS and others
the reason Adoption Agency charged the client a âcourt filing fee.â The client was not told the
truth.

28. Subsequently, in order to better conceal the money that Adoption Agency clients
were being charged in order to fund the bribery scheme, PARRIS, and her co-conspirators began
concealing the cost of the bribes within the âForeign Program Feesâ that were charged to Adoption
Agencyâs clients. Adoption Agency clients in the Uganda program were often charged more than

$10,000 each in âForeign Program Fees.â

 
ease: Liz0-cr-00424-S0 Doc#i 1 Filed: 08/13/20 LO of 44, P

   

29. PARRIS, MIREMBE, and their co-conspirators also deceived Adoption Agencyâs
clients about the circumstances of the children to be adopted, including by providing Adoption
Agency clients with fraudulent welfare reports that were corruptly procured and by concealing that
the children were not properly determined to be eligible for intercountry adoption.

30. Â° For example, on or about October 14, 2014, PARRIS called an Adoption Agency
client and informed the client that a certain child was potentially available for adoption, even
though PARRIS knew the child was not eligible to be referred for adoption at that time. In or
around February 2015, Adoption Agency sent a referral package via email to the Adoption Agency
client that included the childâs welfare report, which had been corruptly procured through bribery.
The corruptly obtained welfare report falsely stated that the childâs mother âis helpless [and]
cannot provide the basic needs of the child.â The referral package also included a copy of a care
order signed by a magistrate judge that was also corruptly obtained through bribery, and which
recommended that the child be placed in the care of Kampala Orphanage A.

31. After the Adoption Agency client completed the adoption of the child, and while
the child was living in the Adoption Agency clientâs home in the United States, the Adoption
Agency client came to believe that certain information she had received in the welfare report was
false and that the: childâs birth mother had not knowingly given the child up for adoption. The
Adoption Agency Client coordinated with an individual residing in Uganda, who traveled to the
childâs home village on or about March 25, 2016, seeking additional information regarding the
childâs true background. PARRIS learned of this visit and called Adoption Agency client within
approximately one day. PARRIS told the client, in sum and substance, that the client should not
further inquire about the childâs background and that the client was putting at risk Adoption

Agencyâs ability to facilitate additional adoptions from the childâs village. Following this phone

10

 

 

 

 

 
ease: Liz0-cr-00424-S0 Doc#i 1 Filed: 08/13/20 Ll of 44. P

   

call, the client obtained the services of a social worker in the United States to assess the childâs
best interests.

32. In or around September 2016, the Adoption Agency client traveled with the child
to Uganda, reunited the child with the childâs birth mother, and relinquished parental rights over
the child back to the childâs birth mother. In total, in connection with the adoption of the child,
the Adoption Agency client made three trips to Uganda, paid approximately $25,000 to Adoption
Agency, paid more than $10,000 dollars to MIREMBE, paid more than $5,000 to an individual
affiliated with MIREMBE and Law Firm A, and incurred thousands of dollars in additional
expenses, including expenses to obtain social work services and legal services in the United States.

PARRIS misrepresents and conceals additional
material information from an Adoption Agency client

33. In or around August 2015, PARRIS referred a Ugandan child to an Adoption
Agency client for potential adoption. PARRIS falsely informed the Adoption Agency client that
the child had not been adopted by another Adoption Agency client solely because the child wanted
to be adopted into a home with a mother and a father, and PARRIS concealed from the Adoption
Agency client, among other things: (1) that the other Adoption Agency client had adopted the
childâs sibling, but had chosen to abandon the child in Uganda after having obtained a guardianship
order establishing custody over the child and spending weeks living with the child and the childâs
sibling in Uganda; and (2) that the welfare report for the child had been corruptly obtained through
bribery.

34. On or about December 28, 2015, PARRIS caused an Adoption Agency employee
to send the Adoption Agency client an email, which, among other things, included the corruptly

obtained welfare report as an attachment and requested that the Adoption Agency client pay

ll

 

 
ease: Liz0-cr-00424-S0 Doc #1 Filed: 08/13/20 12 of 44, P

   

Adoption Agency $10,010 in connection with the adoption of the child, including $9,335 for the
âForeign Program Fee.â

35. Onor about December 31, 2015, the Adoption Agency Client mailed a check from
West Virginia to Adoption Agencyâs office in Strongsville, Ohio in the amount of $10,010.
Adoption Agency deposited this check into the Adoption Agencyâs Ohio-based account on or
about January 4, 2016.

36. The Adoption Agency client traveled to Uganda in or around March 2016 to pursue
the adoption of the child. By that time, the Adoption Agency client had already paid Adoption
Agency approximately $26,000 in connection with this potential adoption. While in Uganda, the
Adoption Agency Client learned that she had been misled by PARRIS about the circumstances
under which the child had become available for adoption.

37. In or around September 2016, the Adoption Agency learned that the Adoption â
Agency client described in Paragraphs 30 through 32 had repatriated a Ugandan adoptee to Uganda
based on concerns that the childâs birth mother was manipulated into giving her child up for
adoption. PARRIS was concerned that other Adoption Agency clients would do so as well, and
that the repatriations would harm Adoption Agencyâs reputation. In October 2016, Longoria tried
to arrange a telephone call between PARRIS and the Adoption Agency client. Longoria wrote,
â(PARRIS] and I received some information this morning from Uganda that we need to share and
discuss with you.â The Adoption agency client responded by asking Longoria to put any
information in writing. Longoria wrote to PARRIS, âAre you going to write to [the Adoption

Agency client]?â PARRIS responded, âNo donât want to put on paper.â

38. In or around November 2016, the Adoption Agency client repatriated the child to
Uganda based on concerns that the childâs birth mother was manipulated into giving her child up
for adoption.

PARRIS, MIREMBE, and their Co-Conspirators cause their clients to submit false information to
the State Department to conceal their marketing of children who have not been properly
determined to be eligible for intercountry adoption

39. PARRIS, MIREMBE, and others also conspired to cause Adoption Agencyâs
clients to provide false information and to submit false documents to the State Department,
including the submission of corruptly obtained fraudulent welfare reports, in order to obtain the
visas necessary to bring the adoptive.children to the United States.

40. For example, in or around May 2015, PARRIS, MIREMBE, and their co-
conspirators caused the Adoption Agency client described in paragraphs 30 to 32 to submit the
false and corruptly obtained welfare report to the State Department in order to procure an IR4 visa
for the child.

41, In another example, PARRIS, MIREMBE, and their co-conspirators created, and
caused to be created, a welfare report for a child that falsely identified the wrong person as the
childâs birth mother and falsely stated that the childâs biological father was deceased. MIREMBE
further attempted to get an Adoption Agency client to submit to the State Department, in
connection with obtaining an IR4 visa for the child, documents that falsely indicated that the
correct birth mother for the child had been identified at the time that the Adoption Agency referred

the child to the Adoption Agency client. PARRIS, in sum and substance, recommended that the

13

 
6) LiO-cr-00424-SO Doc#i 1 Filed: 08/13/20 14 of 44, Pes

   

Adoption Agency client allow MIREMBE to submit the false documents to the State Department
as part of the visa application.

42. In another example, on or about May 19, 2015, MIREMBE emailed PARRIS and
Longoria and instructed them to create false documents in association with an IR4 visa application
to be submitted to the State Department by an Adoption Agency client because otherwise âit will
be problematic at embassy.â In response to the request, Longoria created documents falsely
representing the date upon which Adoption Agency referred the child to the client in order to
conceal the short amount of time child had been in the orphanage before being referred for
intercountry adoption. Longoria, in coordination with PARRIS, provided the false and fraudulent
documents to the client, and, on or about July 30, 2015, MIREMBE caused the client to submit
the false and fraudulent documents to the State Department as part the visa application.

Intercountry Adoption from Poland to the United States

43.  Atall times relevant to this Indictment, the Council on Accreditation (âCOAâ) was
the entity responsible for accrediting any agency in the United States that sought to provide
intercountry adoption services. COA required accredited adoption agencies to provide annual
certifications attesting that they were in substantial compliance with applicable regulations, and to
timely report certain events, including dissolved adoptions and abuse of adoptees. COA also could
suspend or cancel an adoption agencyâs accreditation to facilitate intercountry adoptionsâif it was
out of compliance with applicable laws, regulations, policies, or procedures.

44. The Ministry of Family, Labor, and Social Policy (the âPolish Central Authorityâ)
was the Polish government agency that determined, among other things, whether an adoption
service provider was permitted to facilitate intercountry adoptions in Poland. For each

intercountry adoption from Poland, adoption service providers were required to transmit a home

14

 

 

 
ease: Liz0-cr-00424-S0 Doc#i 1 Filed: 08/13/20 15 0f 44, P

   

study of prospective adoptive parents, which included a criminal background check on all adults
living in the home, to the Polish Central Authority. The State Department was also required to
send a letter to. the Polish Central Authority indicating its approval for particular United States
prospective adoptive parents to adopt particular Polish children. The State Department also had
to approve a visa for the prospective adoptee to be brought to the United States for adoption.

45. Adoption service providers were obligated to report any disruption or dissolution
of an intercountry adoption to the Council on Accreditation within 30 business days. Adoption
service providers were also required to report any disruption of an intercountry adoption from
Poland to the Polish Central Authority.

Details of the Poland Criminal Scheme

46. Adoption Agency had established an adoption program in Poland in or around
2014. The Poland program was an important potential revenue source for COLE and Adoption
Agency.

47. Poland Client was a client of Adoption Agency who transferred into Adoption
Agencyâs Poland program in or around 2015. Poland Client originally expressed a preference to
adopt one child. In or around early 2015, after Adoption Agency informed Poland Client about
the potential of adopting two siblings (Child | and Child 2), Poland Client initially agreed to adopt
both siblings.

48. On or about March 4, 2015, the State Department sent a letter to the Polish Central
Authority that indicated the State Departmentâs approval for Poland Client to adopt Child 1 and
Child 2. The Polish Central Authority also received the completed home study for Poland Client

that showed Poland Clientâs suitability to complete an intercountry adoption.

15
ease: Liz0-cr-00424-S0 Doc#i 1 Filed: 08/13/20 16 of 44, P

   

49. Â° In or around May 2015, Poland Client traveled to Poland. In Poland, Co-
Conspirator 1 was introduced to Poland Client as Adoption Agencyâs in-country representative.
Over the course of weeks in Poland with Child 1 and Child 2, Poland Client developed concerns
as to whether Poland Client could adequately meet the physical and emotional needs of both
siblings. Poland Client expressed that concern to Co-Conspirator 1. In response, Co-Conspirator
1 told Poland Client that if Poland Client did not adopt both siblings, they would be âred-markedâ
and unlikely to be adopted by anyone else. Co-Conspirator 1, in sum and substance, also told
Poland Client to adopt both siblings and then, once in the United States, find another family in the
United States to adopt Child 2.

50. At around the time that Co-Conspirator 1 pressured Poland Client to adopt both
siblings, Adoption Agency had approximately 40 pending clients in the Poland program. These
pending clients represented more than $1 million of potential revenue to Adoption Agency, and
hundreds of thousands of dollars of potential revenue to Co-Conspirator 1âs company.

51. Poland Client contacted COLE for assistance. In an email to COLE dated on or
about June 21, 2015, Poland Client described the concerns about raising both Child 1 and Child 2.
Poland Client expressed a strong desire to find another family to raise Child 2. Poland Client also
offered to travel to wherever in the United States that the other family resided to deliver Child 2
to that other family.

52. After receiving no response from COLE, Poland Client emailed COLE again three
days later and again expressed Poland Clientâs intention not to keep custody of Child 2. Poland
Client wrote to COLE, âI just want to follow up from my last email to see if there is anything [we]

need to be doing to make the process run more smoothly for the dissolution.â

16
ease: Liz0-cr-00424-S0 Doc#i 1 Filed: 08/13/20 17 of 44, P

   

53. COLE identified for Poland Client a few persons who would potentially adopt
Child 2, including Parris Relatives | and 2. COLE described Parris Relatives 1 and 2 as having a
biological child close in age to Child 2, which Poland Client believed made them a good fit. On
or about June 29, 2015, Poland Client emailed COLE, âWe are hopefully coming home sometime
this week and we need to make a plan... We both feel that we would prefer that [Child 2] is with
[Parris Relatives | and 2]... Have [Parris Relatives 1 and 2] been working on their home study?â
COLE never responded to that question.

54, Poland Client, while still in Poland, was told that Parris Relatives 1 and 2 were
relatives of PARRIS. Poland Client and PARRIS spoke multiple times by phone about Child 2.
Based on these conversations, Poland Client understood that PARRIS expected that Parris
Relatives | and 2.would permanently adopt Child 2. Poland Client and PARRIS agreed that Poland
Client would travel from Poland to Texas with Child 1 and Child 2, where Poland Client would
meet PARRIS at the airport and, through PARRIS, transfer Child 2 to Parris Relatives | and 2.

55. On or about June 27, 2015, Poland Clientâs adoptions of Child 1 and Child 2
became final under Polish law. .

56. On or about July 1, 2015, Poland Client applied for United States visas for Child 1
and Child 2 and was interviewed at the United States Embassy in Warsaw, Poland. Poland Client,
based on instructions from Co-Conspirator 1, did not mention that Poland Client had taken steps
to transfer custody of Child 2 to another family upon arrival in the United States. Rather, the visa
applications indicated that both Child.1 and Child 2 would live at Poland Clientâs home address.
On or about July 2, 2015, Poland Client obtained visas for both siblings. ,

57. On or about July 4, 2015, Poland Client traveled from Poland to Dallas/Fort Worth

International Airport (DFW Airport) with Child 1 and Child 2. There, Poland Client met PARRIS,

17
ease: Liz0-cr-00424-S0 Doc#i 1 Filed: 08/13/20 18 of 44, P

   

who had arranged for an attorney in Texas to draft documentation related to the transfer of custody
of Child 2 from Poland Client to Parris Relatives | and 2. PARRIS also arranged for Longoria to
meet them at DFW Airport to notarize the signatures on the transfer of custody paperwork.

58. Poland Client signed the documents at DFW Airport. PARRIS took Child 2 from
Poland Client: Poland Client traveled to her home with Child 1. Parris Relative 2, who
accompanied PARRIS to DFW but did not meet Poland Client, took custody of Child 2, who then
lived with Parris Relatives 1 and 2.

59. Adoption Agency had not obtained a home study or a criminal background check
of Parris Relatives 1 and 2âalthough COLE, PARRIS, and Co-Conspirator | all knew that
families pursuing intercountry adoptions from Poland were required to complete home studies and
undergo background checks.

60. In the months following July 4, 2015, Adoption Agency failed to inform the
Council on Accreditation, the State Department, and the Polish Central Authority that it had
facilitated the transfer of Child 2 from Poland Client to Parris Relatives 1 and 2, notwithstanding
its obligation under federal regulations to do so. COLE and PARRIS knew, however, that Parris
Relatives 1 and 2 continued to have custody of Child 2 and that Parris Relatives | and 2 intended
for the arrangement to be permanent.

61, On or about August 27, 2015, PARRIS sent an email to COLE and another
Adoption Agency employee that contained a proposed entry by PARRIS for an Adoption Agency
blog, in which PARRIS wrote, â[Parris Relatives 1 and 2] just adopted a young [child] from Poland
... Thad guided them through the process of international adoption on everything they could

expect from this journey...â

18
SASe! LQO-cr0424-SO Doct 1 Filed: O8/S5/20 19 of 44. Pp

   

62. Parris Relatives | and 2 attempted to finalize the adoption of Child 2 under Texas
law. In order to do so, Parris Relative 2 provided a licensed clinical social worker with information
about Parris Relative 2âs criminal history, which included an arrest for domestic violence.
PARRIS learned of Parris Relative 2âs criminal history no later than in or around December 2015.
Parris Relatives 1 and 2 completed the adoption of Child 2 under Texas law in or around February
2016.

63. On or about April 18, 2016, in order to conceal the conduct related to the adoption
of Child 2 by Parris Relative 1 and 2, COLE caused Adoption Agency to submit a false report to
the Council on Accreditation related to the âdisruption / dissolutionâ of the adoption of Child 2
(the âApril 2016 COA Reportâ). The April 2016 COA Report contained the following false
statements, among others: (1) that Poland Client initially transferred Child 2 to Parris Relatives 1
and 2 for respite (temporary) care; and (2) that the âdisruption / dissolutionâ of the adoption of
Child 2 occurred within 30 days of the report (on March 21, 2016), even though Parris Relatives
1 and 2 took custody of Child 2 in July 2015 and completed the adoption of Child 2 under Texas
law of in Februaryâ2016. The April 2016 COA Report also concealed that Parris Relatives 1 and
2 were relatives of an Adoption Agency employee. .

64, On or about August 10, 2016, PARRIS contacted a counselor for a social services
agency who resided in Texas and was experienced in intercountry adoption (âAdoption
Counselorâ) and told her that Child 2 required counseling. On or about August 12, 2016, Parris
Relative 1 informed Adoption Counselor that Child 2 had been injured. Adoption Counselor told
Parris Relative 1 that Child 2 must be taken for a medical exam before the counseling program

could begin.

19
ease: Liz0-cr-00424-S0 Doc #1 Flled: 08/15/20 20 of 44. PageiD #20

   

65. Adoption Counselor discovered that Child 2 had been placed into the home of Parris
Relatives 1 and 2 before they had completed a home study. Adoption Counselor was concerned
that PARRIS had not fully informed Adoption Counselor about the amount of time that Child 2
had been living in Parris Relative | and 2âs home.

66. On or about August 12, 2016, Adoption Counselor 1 reported Adoption Agencyâs
actions related to Child 2 to the Council on Accreditation.

67. Child 2 was taken to Cook Childrenâs Hospital in Ft. Worth, Texas. Medical staff
identified significant injuries in several areas of Child 2âs body. Child 2âs case was referred to the
Texas Department of Family and Protective Services, which removed Child 2 from Parris Relative
1 and 2âs home. Child 2âs case was also referred to the Denton Police Department.

68. In or around late August 2016, the Denton Police Department informed Poland
Client that Child 2 had been injured. At around that same time, COLE contacted Poland Client.
COLE expressed concern to Poland Client that Adoption Agency would no longer be able to
complete adoptions in Poland because of the events concerning Child 2.

69. On or about September 2, 2016, COLE submitted another report to the Council on
Accreditation regarding the injury to Child 2 (the âSeptember 2016 COA Reportâ). In the report,
COLE wrote of Parris Relatives | and 2, â[t]he family in question is not a[n] [Adoption Agency]
family.â COLE again concealed in the September 2016 COA Report that Parris Relatives 1 and 2
were related to PARRIS, and also concealed that Adoption Agency facilitated the transfer of Child
2 to them.

70, On or about December 9, 2016, COLE received an email from the Polish Central
Authority informing her that it had suspended Adoption Agencyâs accreditation in Poland. It had

done so because of what it had learned about the treatment of Child 2.

20
ease: Liz0-cr-00424-S0 Doc#i 1 Filed: 08/13/20 21 of 44, P

   

71. Also on or about December 9, 2016, Parris Relative 1 wrote an email to PARRIS
that falsely stated, â[We] were just temporary guardians of there [sic] four year old child from
Poland until they decided what they wanted to do with the child until February 2016â. PARRIS
ââ knowing that Parris Relatives | and 2 took custody of Child 2 in July 2015 with the intent to
permanently adopt the child â forwarded the false email to COLE.

72. On or about December 11, 2016, COLE emailed a letter to the Polish Central
Authority (the âDecember 2016 Letterâ), In the December 2016 Letter, COLE made false
representations and concealed material facts in an attempt to get Adoption Agency reinstated in
Poland. In the December 2016 Letter, COLE, among other things: (1) falsely stated that Poland
Client transferred Child 2 to Parris Relatives 1 and 2 in July 2015 for temporary care although
Poland Client had repeatedly told COLE that she intended to transfer Child 2 to Parris Relatives 1
and 2 permanently; (2) concealed from the Polish Central Authority that Parris Relatives 1 and 2 |
were, as COLE knew, relatives of an Adoption Agency employee; and (3) concealed the role of
herself, PARRIS, and Co-Conspirator 1 in arranging the transfer of Child 2 to Parris Relatives 1
and 2.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Monday, August 17, 2020

Three Individuals Charged with Arranging Adoptions from Uganda and Poland Through Bribery
and Fraud

Three women were charged in a 13-count indictment filed on Aug. 14 in the Northern District of Ohio for their alleged roles in schemes to
corruptly and fraudulently procure adoptions of Ugandan and Polish children through bribing Ugandan officials and defrauding U.S. adoptive
parents, U.S. authorities, and a Polish regulatory authority.

Margaret Cole, 73, of Strongsville, Ohio, Debra Parris, 68, of Lake Dallas, Texas, and Dorah Mirembe, 41, of Kampala, Uganda, were charged in
the indictment. In relation to the Uganda scheme, Parris and Mirembe were each charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and commit visa fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and wire fraud, one count of conspiracy to
commit money laundering, three substantive FCPA counts and three substantive counts of money laundering. Parris was also charged with one
count of mail fraud. In relation to the Poland scheme, Parris and Cole were each charged with one count of conspiracy to defraud the United
States. Cole was further charged with one count of making a false statement to a U.S. accrediting entity and one count of making a false
statement to a Polish authority.

âThe defendants allegedly resorted to bribery and fraud to engage in an international criminal adoption scheme that took children from their
home countries in Uganda and Poland without properly determining whether they were actually orphaned. The defendants sought to profit from
their alleged criminal activity at the expense of families and vulnerable children,â said Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian C. Rabbitt of the
Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division. âThese charges clearly show that the Department of Justice is committed to protecting children
worldwide, including those involved in the international adoption process.â

âThese defendants are accused of orchestrating an alleged scheme that bribed Ugandan officials, defrauded the United States and manipulated
parents inside and outside of the country,â said U.S. Attorney Justin Herdman of the Northern District of Ohio. âAs a result of this alleged
conduct, prospective parents were deceived, hundreds of thousands of dollars were misused and innocent children were displaced from their
homes.â

âThese three defendants preyed on the emotions of parents, those wanting the best for their child, and those wishing to give what they thought
was an orphaned child a family to love,â said Special Agent in Charge Eric B. Smith of the FBIâs Cleveland Field Office. âThese defendants
allegedly lied to both sides of the adoption process, and bribed Ugandan officials who were responsible for the welfare of children. Parents,
prospective parents and children were emotionally vested and were heartbroken when they learned of the selfishness and greed in which these
three engaged. The FBI will never cease in its efforts to protect the innocent and unwitting from those who prey on that trust and confidence
and we will vigorously pursue and hold those responsible accountable.â

With respect to the Uganda scheme, the indictment alleges that Parris and Mirembe, together with others, engaged in a scheme to pay bribes
to Ugandan officials to corruptly procure the adoption of Ugandan children by families in the United States, including the adoption of children
who were not properly determined to be orphaned and who had to be ultimately returned to their birth parents.

Specifically, Parris, Mirembe, and their co-conspirators allegedly (1) paid bribes to social welfare officers in exchange for them issuing welfare
reports recommending that certain children be placed into orphanages without first ensuring that the children were actually orphaned or that
putting them up for adoption was in the childrenâs best interest; (2) paid bribes to Ugandan magistrate judges to obtain court orders placing
those children in an orphanage that was willing to accept the children without inquiring into whether they were actually orphans; (3) paid bribes
to court registrars to cause the court registrars to assign the cases of these children to two corrupt âadoption-friendlyâ judges; and (4) paid
bribes to the corrupt Ugandan judges to obtain orders to permit their clients to bring the children to the United States for adoption.

Parris, Mirembe, and others also allegedly lied to, and concealed material information from, adoptive parents, including lying about the bribe
payments and whether the children were properly determined to be eligible for adoption, and concealing other material information about the
childrenâs history. The indictment also alleges that Parris, Mirembe, and others agreed to cause false documents to be submitted to the U.S.
Department of State to hide the corrupt and fraudulent scheme and to mislead it in its adjudication of visa applications for the Ugandan children
being considered for adoption. The co-conspirators and the entities they worked for received more than $900,000 in connection with these
adoptions.

With respect to the Poland scheme, the indictment alleges that after clients of their adoption agency determined they could not care for one of
the two Polish children they were set to adopt, Cole and Parris took steps to transfer the child to Parrisâs relatives, who were not eligible for
intercountry adoption and one of whom had a criminal arrest record. After the child was physically abused, Cole and Parris took steps to
conceal their improper conduct from the entity responsible for accrediting U.S. intercountry adoption agenciesâand from the Polish authority
responsible for intercountry adoptionsâin an attempt to continue profiting from these adoptions.

An indictment is merely an allegation and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of
law.

18. Investment Bank 2, the identity of which is known to the Grand Jury,
was an international investment bank owned by a foreign government, and had offices in
New York, London and elsewhere.

19. The International Monetary Fund (âIMFâ) was an inter-governmental
institution that, until in or about March 2016, provided financial assistance and advice to
Mozambique. To receive such assistance, Mozambique agreed, among other things, to limit
its borrowing from private lenders.

II. Terms and Definitions

20. A âsecurityâ was, among other things, any note, stock, bond, debenture,
evidence of indebtedness, investment contract or participation in any profit-sharing
agreement.

21. A âsyndicated loanâ was a loan arranged by one or more banks on
behalf of a group of lenders, referred to as a syndicate, who work together to provide funds
for a single borrower.

22. A âloan participation noteâ or âLPNâ was a fixed-income security that

Il. The Fraudulent Scheme
A. Overview

24. Through a series of financial transactions between approximately 2013
and 2016, Proindicus, EMATUM and MAM borrowed in excess of $2 billion through loans
guaranteed by the Mozambican government. The loans were arranged by Investment Bank
1 and Investment Bank 2 and sold to investors worldwide, including in the United States.
Over the course of the transactions, the co-conspirators, among other things, conspired to
defraud investors and potential investors in the Proindicus, EMATUM and MAM financings
through numerous material misrepresentations and omissions relating to, among other things:
(i) the use of loan proceeds, (ii) bribe and kickback payments to Mozambican government
officials and bankers, (iii) the amount and maturity dates of debt owed by Mozambique, and
(iv) Mozambiqueâs ability and intention to pay back the investors.

25. Each of the companies entered into contracts with Privinvest to provide
equipment and services to complete the maritime projects. The loan proceeds were
supposed to be used exclusively for the maritime projects, and nearly all of the borrowed
money was paid directly to Privinvest, the sole contractor for the projects, to benefit
Mozambique and its people. In reality, the defendants JEAN BOUSTANI, NAJIB
ALLAM, MANUEL CHANG, ANTONIO DO ROSARIO, TEOFILO NHANGUMELE,
ANDREW PEARSE, SURJAN SINGH and DETELINA SUBEVA, together with others,
created the maritime projects as fronts to raise money to enrich themselves and intentionally
diverted portions of the loan proceeds to pay at least $200 million in bribes and kickbacks to

themselves, Mozambican government officials and others.
26. The co-conspirators applied only a portion of the loan proceeds towards
the maritime projects. In furtherance of the scheme, Privinvest charged inflated prices for
the equipment and services it provided, which were then used, at least in part, to pay bribes
and kickbacks. After conducting little or no business activity, Proindicus, EMATUM and
MAM each defaulted on their loans.

B. Relevant Internal Accounting Controls of Investment Bank 1

27. The FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Sections 78m(b)(2)(B),
78m(b)(4), 78(b)(5) and 78ff(a) required issuers to maintain a system of sufficient internal
accounting controls and made it illegal to knowingly and willfully circumvent such controls.

28. Investment Bank 1 had internal accounting controls (âinternal
controlsâ) that addressed, among other things, the prevention of bribery of and by Investment
Bank 1 employees; the prevention of money laundering and other financial crimes; conflicts
of interests; outside employment; and the use of intermediaries in financial transactions.
Investment Bank 1âs compliance department exercised primary responsibility for overseeing
and enforcing Investment Bank 1âs internal controls.

29. Within Investment Bank 1, the group of investment bankers assigned to
a specific transaction was called the âdeal team.â The defendants ANDREW PEARSE,
SURJAN SINGH and DETELINA SUBEVA were part of the deal team on the Proindicus
project and SINGH was a member of the deal team on the EMATUM project. They
received regular training on Investment Bank 1âs internal controls and were also aware of

. those internal controls through their involvement in numerous transactions.

C. The Proindicus Project

30. Onor about January 18, 2013, Privinvest entered into a $366 million
contract with Proindicus to supply materials and training to protect Mozambiqueâs territorial
waters. On or about February 28, 2013, pursuant to a written loan agreement, Investment
Bank 1 agreed to arrange a $372 million syndicated loan to Proindicus, guaranteed by the
Republic of Mozambique (the âProindicus Loanâ). The defendant SURJAN SINGH signed
the loan agreement on behalf of Investment Bank 1, the defendant ANTONIO DO
ROSARIO co-signed on behalf of Proindicus and the defendant MANUEL CHANG signed
the government guarantee for the loan on behalf of Mozambique. Between approximately
June and August 2013, Investment Bank | increased the Proindicus Loan by approximately
$132 million. On or about November 15, 2013, Investment Bank 2 further increased the
Proindicus Loan by $118 million, bringing the total loaned amount to $622 million.
Proindicus never conducted significant operations or generated significant revenue and
defaulted on its loan payment due on or about March 21, 2017.

(1) Bribery of Mozambican Government Officials to Gain Approval for the
Proindicus Project

31. Beginning in or about 2011, the defendant JEAN BOUSTANI, through
discussions with the defendant TEOFILO NHANGUMELE arranged by Privinvest Co-
Conspirator 1, attempted to persuade Mozambican government officials to establish a coastal
monitoring system through a contract with Privinvest. Almost immediately, BOUSTANI
and NHANGUMELE negotiated the first round of bribe and kickback payments that

Privinvest would have to make for the benefit of Mozambican government officials for the
project to be approved. For example, in furtherance of the scheme, BOUSTANI,
NHANGUMELE and other co-conspirators had the following discussions:

(a) | Onor about November 11, 2011, NHANGUMELE wrote to
BOUSTANI by email, stating: âTo secure that the project is granted a go-ahead by the HoS
[Head of State], a payment has to be agreed before we get there, so that we know and agree,
well in advance, what ought to be paid and when. Whatever advance payments to be paid
before the project, they can be built in the project, and recovered.â

(b) Later on or about the same day, November 11, 2011,
BOUSTANI wrote to NHANGUMELE by email, stating: âA very important issue which
needs to be clear: we had various negative experiences in Africa. Especially related to the
âsuccess feesâ payments. Therefore, we have a strict policy in the Group consisting of not
disbursing any âsuccess feeâ before the signature of the Project Contract.â

(c) | Onor about November 14, 2011, NHANGUMELE responded
by email to BOUSTANI, stating: âFabulous, I agree with you in principle. Let us agree and
look at project in two distinct moments. One moment is to massage the system and get the
political will to go ahead with the project. The second moment is the project
implementation/execution. I agree with you that any monies can only be paid after the
project signing. This has to be treated separately from the project implementation .. .
Because for the project implementation there will be other players whose interest will have to
be looked after e.g. ministry of defense, ministry of interior, air force, etc. . . . in democratic
governments like ours people come and go, and everyone involved will want to have his/her

share of the deal while in office, because once out of the office it will be difficult. So, it is
important that the contract signing success fee be agreed and paid in once-off, upon the
signing of the contract.â
32. Soon thereafter, during an email exchange on or about December 28,

2011, the defendants JEAN BOUSTANI and TEOFILO NHANGUMELE agreed to $50
million in bribe and kickback payments to Mozambican government officials and $12
million in kickbacks for Privinvest co-conspirators. For example:

(a) On or about December 28, 2011, in response to an email from
BOUSTANI requesting a bribe and kickback figure, NHANGUMELE wrote: âFine brother.
I have consulted and please put 50 million chickens. Whatever numbers you have on your
poultry I will add 50 million of my breed.â

(b) Onor about the same day, BOUSTANI forwarded this email to
Privinvest personnel, stating, âSOM for them and 12M for [Privinvest Co-Conspirator 1]
(5%) ==> total of 62M on top.â

33. After more than a year of negotiations, on or about January 18, 2013,

Privinvest and Proindicus signed a $366 million contract for Privinvest to provide a coastal
monitoring system to Mozambique. Five days later, on or about January 23, 2013, the
defendant JEAN BOUSTANI instructed a bank in the UAE to make payments to the
defendant TEOFILO NHANGUMELE and Mozambican Co-Conspirator 1. The
instructions ordered the bank, in relevant part: âUpon receipt by Privinvest Shipbuilding of a
minimum amount of US$ 317,000,000 . . . to pay immediately: a. Teofilo Nhangumele the
sum of US$ 5,100,000 . . . and b. [Mozambican Co-Conspirator 1] the sum of
US$ 5,100,000.â The instructions also ordered the bank to pay NHANGUMELE and

Mozambican Co-Conspirator 1 an additional approximately $3.4 million each at later dates.

10
(2) Bribery to Gain Mozambiqueâs Government Guarantee for the
Proindicus Financing

34. | At the same time as the defendants JEAN BOUSTANI and TEOFILO
NHANGUMELE were negotiating bribe payments to cause Mozambican government
officials to approve the Proindicus project, BOUSTANI recruited Investment Bank 1 to
arrange financing for the project. During negotiations, bankers at Investment Bank 1 made
clear that Investment Bank 1 would only arrange a loan that was at or near market interest
rates, with debt that was either directly issued by the Government of Mozambique or
guaranteed by the government.

35. To further negotiations on the Proindicus project, on or about
September 13, 2012, the defendant ANDREW PEARSE traveled to the UAE to meet with
the defendants JEAN BOUSTANI and TEOFILO NHANGUMELE and a close relative of a
senior Mozambican government official, among others.

36. Tohelp obtain Mozambiqueâs agreement to Investment Bank 1âs terms,
including that any loan be at or near market rates and guaranteed by the Mozambican
government, the defendants JEAN BOUSTANI and TEOFILO NHANGUMELE enlisted the
defendant MANUEL CHANG, Mozambiqueâs Minister of Finance. On or about December
22, 2012, CHANG wrote a letter to Privinvest Co-Conspirator 2, which was forwarded to an
employee of Investment Bank 1 (âInvestment Bank 1 Employee 1â), an individual whose
identity is known to the Grand Jury, explaining that âthe financing of this project is still
constrained by the IMF imposed limitation on the Government for Mozambique to accept
commercial credit for commercial projects. Therefore, we have devised an alternative

solution whereby an SPV [Special Purpose Vehicle] . . . will be formed.â

11
37. | Onor about December 26, 2012, the defendant JEAN BOUSTANI sent
an email to the defendant TEOFILO NHANGUMELE in preparation for a meeting in
Mozambique between employees of Investment Bank 1, Privinvest and Proindicus to
negotiate the terms of the transaction. In the email, BOUSTANI emphasized: âBut the only
imperative matter for [Investment Bank 1] bro is [the defendant MANUEL CHANGâs]
signature of the guarantee for the loan.â

38. | Onor about February 28, 2013, the defendant MANUEL CHANG
signed the guarantee for the Proindicus Loan. In or about and between October 2013 and
December 2013, the defendants JEAN BOUSTANI and NAJIB ALLAM, along with others,
paid at least $5 million in bribe and kickback payments for the benefit of CHANG from a
bank account in the UAE, through the United States, to a bank account in Spain.

(3) Conspiracy to Circumvent Investment Bank 1âs Internal Controls and
Win Business for Investment Bank | in Connection with the Proindicus

Project, Including Paying Bribes to Mozambican Government Officials

39. | While negotiations over the Proindicus financings proceeded in 2012
and early 2013, the defendants ANDREW PEARSE, SURJAN SINGH and DETELINA
SUBEVA, together with others, conspired to circumvent Investment Bank 1âs internal
controls to enrich themselves and win the Proindicus business for Investment Bank 1,
including through the payment of bribes to Mozambican government officials. At the time,
PEARSE, SINGH and SUBEVA were agents acting within the scope of their employment on
behalf of Investment Bank 1, with the intent, at least in part, to benefit Investment Bank 1.

40. Investment Bank 1âs internal controls required employees, including
the compliance department and the deal team, to evaluate the potential for corruption related

to the Proindicus project and the Mozambican government officials who would be involved

12
in running it. Investment Bank 1âs review process identified certain red flags concerning the
proposed Proindicus transaction at an early stage. On or about March 9, 2012, in response
to a question from Investment Bank 1 Employee 1 as to whether there was a competitive
bidding process that resulted in Privinvest being selected, the defendant JEAN BOUSTANI
replied by email, copying the defendant SURJAN SINGH, that the selection of Privinvest
had not resulted from a competitive bid and that the deal had come about due to âhigh level
connectionsâ between Privinvest and the Mozambican government.

41.  JInor about March 2012, in anticipation of arranging financing for the
Proindicus project, Investment Bank 1 employees began conducting due diligence, or
research, on the parties involved in the project. Accordingly, as early as approximately
March 12, 2012, Investment Bank 1 employees identified allegations of corruption
associated with Privinvest Co-Conspirator 2. On that day, Investment Bank 1 Employee 1
reported to his superior and the defendant SURJAN SINGH that Investment Bank 1 had
previously designated Privinvest Co-Conspirator 2 as âan undesirable client.â Furthermore,
on or about March 13, 2012, Investment Bank 1 Employee 1 began collecting approximately
10 news articles containing potentially derogatory information regarding Privinvest Co-
Conspirator 2, and exchanged emails with SINGH regarding the information and articles.

42. Notwithstanding the existence of such red flags, while conducting due
diligence on the Proindicus transaction as required by Investment Bank 1âs internal controls,
the defendants ANDREW PEARSE, SURJAN SINGH and DETELINA SUBEVA withheld
information about the likelihood of corruption connected to the Proindicus transaction from
Investment Bank 1âs compliance department. For instance, in or about November 2012, at

the direction of the head of Investment Bank 1âs compliance department, members of the

13
Proindicus deal team consulted with a senior executive for Investment Bank 1âs Europe,
Middle East and Africa (âEMEAâ) region (the âEMEA Executiveâ), an individual whose
identity is known to the Grand Jury, regarding any legal or reputational concerns that the
Proindicus transaction might raise for the bank. On or about November 19, 2012, PEARSE
summarized those discussions in an email he sent to Investment Bank 1 Employee 1, writing
that the EMEA Executive âsaid no to the combination of Moz[ambique] and your friend
[Privinvest Co-Conspirator 2], so we need to structure him out of the picture.â Similarly,
Investment Bank | maintained a report in its due diligence files describing Privinvest Co-
Conspirator 2 as a âmaster of kickbacks.â Despite such information, PEARSE, SINGH and
Investment Bank 1 Employee 1 all failed to relay the EMEA Executiveâs concerns to
Investment Bank 1âs compliance department, and the compliance department failed to pursue
its inquiry further.

43. Furthermore, the defendants ANDREW PEARSE, SURJAN SINGH
and DETELINA SUBEVA conspired to withhold from Investment Bank 1âs compliance
department that Privinvest and Proindicus sought to appoint an individual in Mozambique
who had previously been involved in fraudulent conduct to Proindicusâs Board of Directors.
Specifically, even though Investment Bank 1 compliance personnel were responsible for
choosing an external firm to perform due diligence on Proindicusâs officers and directors, in
or about February 2013, the defendants ANDREW PEARSE, DETELINA SUBEVA and
SURJAN SINGH secretly selected a due diligence firm (âDue Diligence Firm 1â), the
identity of which is known to the Grand Jury, to research the transaction and pre-screen the
individuals identified as directors of Proindicus to secure approval by Investment Bank 1

compliance personnel.

14
44, [nor around February 2013, Due Diligence Firm 1 reported to the
defendants ANDREW PEARSE, SURJAN SINGH and DETELINA SUBEVA that one of
the proposed directors of Proindicus had previously been involved in fraudulent conduct
while he was an officer of a Mozambican state-owned company. PEARSE, SINGH and
SUBEVA did not share this information with Investment Bank 1âs compliance department.
Instead, PEARSE, SINGH and SUBEVA obtained a replacement group of directors, which
included the defendant ANTONIO DO ROSARIO, from Privinvest and Proindicus and asked
Due Diligence Firm 1 for a background investigation onthem. Due Diligence Firm 1
reported fewer red flags related to the second group of directors.

45. On or about February 26, 2013, having pre-cleared the second group of
Proindicus directors and without revealing that two separate groups of directors had been
researched, the defendant DETELINA SUBEVA forwarded the names of the second group
of proposed directors to Investment Bank 1âs compliance department for due diligence by the
firm that the compliance department had selected (âDue Diligence Firm 2â), the identity of
which is known to the Grand Jury. After reviewing a report from Due Diligence Firm 2, the
compliance department approved the new group of directors.

(4) Conspiracy to Remove or Modify Conditions on the Proindicus Loan that
Had Been Consistent with Investment Bank 1âs Internal Controls

46. As part of its system of internal controls, Investment Bank 1 imposed
conditions that Mozambique would have to meet to receive a loan. Some of those
conditions, however, carried a risk of exposing the existence of the Proindicus project to the
Mozambican public and members of Mozambiqueâs government beyond the circle of

government officials who were part of the fraudulent scheme. To conceal the fraudulent

15
scheme, avoid scrutiny and help win business for Investment Bank 1, the defendants
ANDREW PEARSE, SURJAN SINGH and DETELINA SUBEVA, together with others,
removed some of Investment Bank 1âs conditions for the Proindicus Loan.

47. For example, Investment Bank 1 originally had required Proindicus to
provide an opinion from the Attorney General of Mozambique concerning the validity of the
government guarantee. On or about February 18, 2013, the defendant JEAN BOUSTANI,
on behalf of both Privinvest and Mozambique, strenuously objected, explaining to the
defendant DETELINA SUBEVA in an email: â[T]he attorney general opinion is not
mandatory . . . I believe that this will not be accepted by Proindicus since its owner wanted to
bypass public tender and normal bureaucratic procedures from day 1 by creating a private
entity!! So they will never accept to inform the attorney general!! The [Minister of

39

Finance] guarantee is legally covered by a presidential decree.â On or before February 28,
2013, the defendants ANDREW PEARSE, SURJAN SINGH and SUBEVA, together with
others, ultimately removed the requirement from the conditions Investment Bank 1 had
imposed.

48. Similarly, on or about February 25, 2013, the defendants ANDREW
PEARSE, SURJAN SINGH and DETELINA SUBEVA, together with others, removed
Investment Bank 1âs condition that Mozambique inform the IMF of the loan. PEARSE,
SINGH and SUBEVA replaced that condition with the less stringent requirement that
Mozambique represent to investors âthat they [were] in compliance with their IMF and

World Bank obligations.â In fact, the IMF was not informed of the Proindicus Loan at the

time of the transaction. Indeed, the IMF learned of the transaction only in or about 2016,

16
when its exposure contributed to the IMFâs decision to cease providing aid and financing to
Mozambique and caused a severe financial crisis in Mozambique.

(5) The Proindicus Loan and Recruiting of Investors in the United States

49. After Investment Bank 1âs compliance department approved the
transaction on or about March 20, 2013, Investment Bank J agreed to arrange a $372 million
syndicated loan to Proindicus, guaranteed by the Republic of Mozambique, pursuant to a
written loan agreement. The defendant SURJAN SINGH signed the loan agreement on
behalf of Investment Bank 1, the defendant ANTONIO DO ROSARIO co-signed on behalf
of Proindicus and the defendant MANUEL CHANG signed the government guarantee on
behalf of Mozambique.

50. The Proindicus loan agreement provided that all payments by the
borrower or the lenders would be paid to Investment Bank 1âs bank account at a New York
City-based financial institution (âNew York City Bank 1â), the identity of which is known to
the Grand Jury. The loan agreement also required Proindicus to âapply all amounts
borrowed by it under the Facility towards the financing of the Project.â Furthermore, the
loan agreement prohibited improper payments in connection with the Proindicus project,
including payments that would violate the FCPA, the United Kingdomâs Bribery Act (âUK
Bribery Actâ) and the Mozambican Anti-Corruption Law.

| 51. Onor about March 21, 2013, Investment Bank 1 transferred the entire
proceeds of the loan, less fees totaling approximately $44 million, through a bank account at
New York City Bank 1, directly to a bank account held by Privinvest at a bank in Abu Dhabi,
UAE (âUAE Bank 1â), the identity of which is known to the Grand Jury. âInvestment Bank

1 immediately solicited United States-based investors to participate in the loan, in part by

17
sending them electronically, among other things, the Proindicus loan agreement and a
confidential information memorandum that summarized its terms.

(6) Proindicus Loan Increase and Bribe and Kickback Payments to PEARSE
and SUBEVA

52. Onor about March 28, 2013, the defendant ANDREW PEARSE
notified the defendants SURJAN SINGH and DETELINA SUBEVA and others at
Investment Bank 1 that Proindicus sought to borrow an additional $250 million from
Investment Bank 1.

53. Onor about June 13, 2013, the defendant MANUEL CHANG signed,
on behalf of Mozambique, a government guarantee for an additional $250 million in
borrowing by Proindicus. One day later, on or about June 14, 2013, Investment Bank | and
Proindicus amended their loan agreement to permit Proindicus to borrow up to an additional
$250 million from Investment Bank 1.

54. Even though Proindicus had conducted no operations, on or about June
23, 2013, Investment Bank 1âs Credit Risk Management team agreed to loan an additional
$100 million to Proindicus based on a memorandum written by the defendants ANDREW
PEARSE, SURJAN SINGH and DETELINA SUBEVA, together with others, representing
that Privinvest required additional equipment.

55. On or about June 25, 2013, Investment Bank 1 wired approximately
$100 million less its fees through New York City Bank 1 to a Privinvest account at UAE
Bank 1. Investment Bank 1 marketed and sold portions of the debt to investors, including to

an investor in the United States.

18
ay os
Rah RE

56. Throughout 2013 and 2014, using loan proceeds, Privinvest made
numerous kickback payments to the defendant ANDREW PEARSE. On or about April 15,
2013, PEARSE opened a bank account at a bank in Abu Dhabi, UAE (âUAE Bank 2â), the
identity of which is known to the Grand Jury. After PEARSE opened the account,
Privinvest wired bribe and kickback payments of more than $45 million from UAE Bank 1
accounts to PEARSEâs UAE Bank 2 account. Each payment was denominated in United
States dollars and each was routed and completed through the UAE banksâ correspondent

bank accounts in New York City and passed through the Eastern District of New York, as

57. | The defendant ANDREW PEARSE shared some of the bribes and
kickbacks that he received from the fraudulent loan proceeds with the defendant DETELINA
SUBEVA. On or about and between June 12, 2013 and October 27, 2013, PEARSE
transferred a total of approximately $2.2 million from bank accounts he held at UAE Bank 2
to a bank account SUBEVA held at UAE Bank 2.

D. EMATUM

58. Onor about August 2, 2013, EMATUM entered into an approximately
$785 million contract with Privinvest to purchase vessels, equipment and training to create a
state-owned tuna fishing company. On or about August 30, 2013, Investment Bank 1 agreed
to make up to $850 million in loans guaranteed by Mozambique to EMATUM (the
âEMATUM Loanâ). The EMATUM loan agreement was signed by, among other people,
the defendant SURJAN SINGH on behalf of Investment Bank 1 and the defendant
ANTONIO DO ROSARIO on behalf of EMATUM. The defendant MANUEL CHANG
signed the government guarantee on behalf of Mozambique. On or about September 11,
2013, Investment Bank 1 loaned approximately $500 million to EMATUM to finance the
EMATUM project and, because Investment Bank | refused to loan additional funds, on or
about October 11, 2013, Investment Bank 2 loaned an additional approximately $350 million

to EMATUM.

20
(1) The Fabricated Rationale for the EMATUM Loan

59. In or about May 2013, while Investment Bank 1 was increasing the
Proindicus Loan by approximately $100 million, the defendants ANDREW PEARSE,
DETELINA SUBEVA, JEAN BOUSTANI and ANTONIO DO ROSARIO, together with
others, agreed to a scheme for Mozambique to borrow another $850 million. A significant
portion of the additional funds would be funneled to Privinvest and then misappropriated, at
least in part, to make additional bribe and kickback payments, pay inflated profits and make
loan payments on the Proindicus Loan to prevent discovery of the co-conspiratorsâ fraudulent
scheme.

60. In approximately July 2013, the defendant ANDREW PEARSE
announced to others at Investment Bank 1 that he intended to leave the bank, but he
remained a bank employee on leave until on or about September 13, 2013. Investment Bank
1 also placed the defendant DETELINA SUBEVA on leave on or about July 22, 2013 and
terminated her on or about August 21, 2013.

61. During the summer of 2013, contrary to Investment Bank 1 policies
and procedures, the defendants ANDREW PEARSE and DETELINA SUBEVA used their
personal email accounts to conspire with Mozambican government officials and Privinvest
employees to effectuate a large loan through Investment Bank | for the EMATUM project.
For example, on or about July 4, 2013, PEARSE used his personal email account to email
SUBEVA and the defendant JEAN BOUSTANI certain questions about a proposal PEARSE
had drawn up to create a tuna fishing fleet. In response, on or about July 4, 2013,
BOUSTANI replied that the defendant ANTONIO DO ROSARIO would âgo ahead in all

suggestions needed in order to maximize funding size.â

21
62. By the end of July 2013, the defendants JEAN BOUSTANI,
ANTONIO DO ROSARIO, ANDREW PEARSE, SURJAN SINGH and DETELINA
SUBEVA, together with others, had established the details of the EMATUM project as a
pretext to justify the maximum possible loan amount, rather than to meet legitimate fishing
needs of the EMATUM project. For example, on or about July 21, 2013, BOUSTANI
emailed DO ROSARIO, copying PEARSE and SUBEVA at their personal email accounts:
â(W]e need your Marshall skills to finish by August 19 . . . we will go for 800 million$ so we
keep a cushion for Proindicus interest payment next year.â Later in the email conversation,
BOUSTANI added: âWe can decrease the trawlers to 25 and add two 45 meters OPVs
[military-style trimaran boats] with special systems to âprotectâ the trawlers. Is that better
Andrew?â PEARSE responded on or about July 21, 2013, to BOUSTANI and SUBEVA,
writing, in part: â2 big fisheries makes a lot of sense and ties into Fisheries Master Plan!â

63. Moreover, to avoid detection of the ongoing fraudulent scheme, the
defendants JEAN BOUSTANI, ANTONIO DO ROSARIO, ANDREW PEARSE and
DETELINA SUBEVA also planned to use some of the EMATUM Loan to pay the debt of
the earlier Proindicus project. On or about July 21, 2013, SUBEVA wrote an email to
BOUSTANI, PEARSE and DO ROSARIO, stating: â[W]e should also keep a cushion for
Proindicus of $17mn so that we donât need to go back to MoF [Ministry of Finance] and they
are on our side.â

(2) Conspiracy to Circumvent Investment Bank 1âs Internal Controls and
Win Business for Investment Bank 1 in Connection with the EMATUM

Project, Including Paying Bribes to Mozambican Government Officials

64. The defendants ANDREW PEARSE, SURJAN SINGH and

DETELINA SUBEVA, together with others, conspired to circumvent Investment Bank 1âs
22
internal controls to enrich themselves and win business for Investment Bank 1 in connection
with the EMATUM project. Thus, even though still employed by Investment Bank 1,
PEARSE and SUBEVA sought to conceal their involvement in setting up the EMATUM
project by using personal email accounts and removing all references to themselves from
documents they had prepared. For example:

(a) Onor about July 27, 2013, in response to a request from the
defendant SURJAN SINGH for information on the tuna fishing proposal, the defendant
ANDREW PEARSE used his personal email account to send an email to the defendant
JEAN BOUSTANI, copying the defendant DETELINA SUBEVA on her personal email
account, stating: âWe are going to send both shortly. Plse bro donât just forward but rather
create new email and attach the docs, [Investment Bank 1] is very sensitive to seeing our
names involved.â

(b)  Onor about July 27, 2013, the defendant DETELINA
SUBEVA, using her personal email account, sent an email concerning the tuna fishing
proposal to the defendants JEAN BOUSTANI and ANDREW PEARSE, addressing the
email to PEARSEâs personal email account, stating: âHi Jean â sending you a full info
package to please send to Surjan [SINGH] in a clean email (without my email details).â
Minutes later, SUBEVA sent documents she titled âfeasibility materialsâ and âfinancial
modelâ to BOUSTANI and PEARSE.

(c) Inresponse, on or about July 27, 2013, the defendant ANDREW
PEARSE used his personal email account to instruct the defendant DETELINA SUBEVA on
her personal email account: â[I]f you go into the properties of each doc, it shows you as the

author. You may want to delete [the metadata] and resendâ the documents. Later the same

23
day, using the same personal email accounts, SUBEVA sent an email to PEARSE stating:
âIâm sure Surj [SINGH] can sanitize worst comes to worst and delete the author.â

65. In addition, the defendants JEAN BOUSTANI, ANDREW PEARSE,
SURJAN SINGH and DETELINA SUBEVA created fake competing bids from contractors
for the EMATUM project in anticipation of an inquiry from Investment Bank 1 as to why
Privinvest would be awarded the project. For example, on or about July 31, 2013, PEARSE
sent an email to the BOUSTANI and SUBEVA stating: âGuys, below is the argument that I
think we (or rather the Borrower) should present to [Investment Bank 1] next week when in
Maputo .... The sponsors of the Borrower (ie the various Ministries, but principally SISE)
at the behest of the President went out to 4 shipyards [we need to have names] asking for
proposals to build a fleet... . There was no need legally to have a public tender as
procurement rules donât apply to private companies, but nonetheless they sought a number of
bids. [ JONLY ADM [a Privinvest entity] responded with the full package and offered an
integrated solution with fishing surveillance, command center and boats.â BOUSTANI
replied: âLetâs say they contacted South African yards and Spanish + Portuguese. Without
naming.â

66.  Inan effort to ensure that Investment Bank 1 would arrange the
EMATUM Loan, the defendant SURJAN SINGH included fake bid information in a
memorandum he wrote and submitted to Investment Bank 1 in or about August 2013 to gain
approval for the EMATUM Loan, falsely asserting that the Privinvest proposal was deemed
the most competitive one in comparison to bids from three other international companies.

67. Moreover, in or about early August 2013, the defendant SURJAN

SINGH travelled to Mozambique to lead Investment Bank 1âs due diligence for the
24
EMATUM transaction. In furtherance of the fraudulent scheme, SINGH and the defendants
ANDREW PEARSE and DETELINA SUBEVA provided talking points and suggested
answers to Mozambican government officials for due diligence meetings with Investment
Bank | in an effort to ensure that Investment Bank 1 would arrange the loan.

68. The defendants ANDREW PEARSE and DETELINA SUBEVA, with
the knowledge of the defendant SURJAN SINGH, also continued to hide their own
involvement in the due diligence process. On or about August 4, 2013, SUBEVA sent an
email to the defendant JEAN BOUSTANI, copying PEARSE, stating: âPlse remind [the
defendant ANTONIO DO ROSARIO] not to mention Andrew [PEARSE] and myself to the
[Investment Bank 1] team! They cannot know we are involved in this project!!!!_ If there is
a slip up, say he knows us from the previous deal.â

(3) The EMATUM Loan Agreement and Solicitation of United States
Investors

69. Onor about August 30, 2013, Investment Bank 1 entered into the
$850 million loan agreement with EMATUM. The EMATUM loan agreement was signed
by, among others, the defendant SURJAN SINGH on behalf of Investment Bank 1 and the
defendant ANTONIO DO ROSARIO on behalf of EMATUM. The defendant MANUEL
CHANG signed the government guarantee on behalf of Mozambique.

70. |The EMATUM loan agreement provided that all payments by the
borrower or the lenders would be paid to Investment Bank 1âs bank account at New York
City Bank 1. The agreement also required EMATUM to âapply all amounts borrowed by it
under the [EMATUM loan agreement] towards . . . the purchase of fishing infrastructure,

33

comprising of 27 vessels, an operations centre, and related training.â The loan agreement

25
also prohibited improper payments in connection with the project, including payments that
would violate the FCPA, the UK Bribery Act and the Mozambican Anti-Corruption Law.

71. Onor about September 11, 2013, Investment Bank 1 sent $500 million
in loan proceeds, less its fees, to Privinvest. Investment Bank 1 funded the EMATUM Loan
by selling loan participation notes to investors in the United States and elsewhere. By email
and other electronic means, Investment Bank 1 sent potential investors, including United
States investors, materials that included the EMATUM loan agreement and an offering
circular. Like the loan agreement, the offering circular stated: âThe proceeds from the Loan
will be used by the Borrower towards the financing of the purchase of fishing infrastructure,
comprising of 27 vessels, an operations centre and related training and for the general
corporate purposes of the Borrower.â

72.  Inreliance on the representations in the loan agreement and offering
circular, investors, including investors in the United States, purchased EMATUM loan
participation notes.

73. Despite projections that EMATUM would generate annual fishing
revenues of approximately $224 million by December 2016, it generated virtually no revenues
and, as of approximately late 2017, conducted no fishing operations. EMATUM defaulted
on its financing payment due on or about January 18, 2017.

(4) Bribes and Kickbacks to the Defendant SURJAN SINGH and
Mozambican Government Officials

74. The defendant SURJAN SINGH also received bribe and kickback
payments directly from Privinvest for his role in the fraudulent scheme. Specifically, on or

about October 20, 2013, the defendant ANDREW PEARSE sent an email to the defendant

26
JEAN BOUSTANI with SINGHâs bank account information at UAE Bank 2, referring to
SINGH as âUncle,â and adding, â[i]f we can do something this week he would appreciate it.â
That same day, on or about October 20, 2013, BOUSTANI forwarded the request to the
defendant NAJIB ALLAM, writing, âUncle... Surjan. Total of 4.â

75. Onor about and between October 23, 2013 and February 27, 2014,
Privinvest wired approximately six payments totaling approximately $4.49 million from its
bank account at UAE Bank 1 to the defendant SURJAN SINGHâs UAE Bank 2 account.
Each payment was routed through the UAE banksâ correspondent bank accounts in New

York City. Privinvest made the following bribe and kickback payments to SINGH:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Date Amount Wire Instruction
October 23, 2013 $800,000 | âpymt on consultancy agreementâ
November 27, 2013 $800,000 | âpmt on consultancy agreementâ
December 23, 2013 $800,000 | âpyt on consultancy agreementâ
January 27, 2014 $800,000 | âpyt on consultancy agreementâ
January 28, 2014 $799,960 | âpyt on consultancy agreementâ
February 27, 2014 $500,000 | âpyt on consultancy agreement.â

 

 

 

 

 

76. The defendants JEAN BOUSTANI and NAJIB ALLAM continued to
coordinate the payment of bribes to Mozambican government officials. On or about April 8,
2014, BOUSTANI sent an email to ALLAM, providing an accounting of bribes through the
Proindicus and EMATUM projects and stating that Privinvest had paid â125 [million U.S.
dollars] for all for everything ....â.- BOUSTANI summarized the distribution of the bribes,
including $8.5 million to the defendant TEOFILO NHANGUMELE, $8.5 million to

Mozambican Co-Conspirator 1, $15 million to the defendant ANTONIO DO ROSARIO,
27
$7 million to the defendant MANUEL CHANG and $3 million to Mozambican Co-
Conspirator 3, among others.

77. Inan effort to conceal the unlawful nature of these payments, the
defendants JEAN BOUSTANI, NAJIB ALLAM and ANTONIO DO ROSARIO used third-
party entities and fabricated invoices to distribute money to the Mozambican government
officials. For example, on or about October 17, 2013, BOUSTANI wrote an email to DO
ROSARIO, stating: âI need asap invoices in the name of: Logistics International Abu Dhabi
[a Privinvest-related company]. Invoices for everything my brother. Each one mentioning
the subject (real estate purchase...etc....). Even for Pantero [the defendant MANUEL
CHANG], a small paper say âconsultancy fees.ââ

78. Accordingly, on or about and between October 20, 2013 and December
4, 2013, the defendant JEAN BOUSTANI caused Privinvest to make bribe payments of
approximately $5 million, from Privinvestâs UAE-based bank account, through the Eastern
District of New York, to a bank account in the name of a company controlled by the
defendant MANUEL CHANG.

E. MAM

(1) MAM Loan Agreement

79. Onor about May 1, 2014, MAM and Privinvest executed an
approximately $500 million contract for Privinvest to, among other things, build a shipyard,
provide additional naval vessels and upgrade two existing facilities to service Proindicus and
EMATUM vessels.

80. On or about May 20, 2014, Investment Bank 2 and the Privinvest entity

Palomar, acting through the defendants ANDREW PEARSE and DETELINA SUBEVA,
28
together with others, arranged a syndicated loan of up to $540 million to MAM, guaranteed
by the Republic of Mozambique (the âMAM Loanâ). Investment Bank 2 solicited investors,
using, among other things, the MAM loan agreement and a confidential information
memorandum that summarized its terms. As with the Proindicus and the EMATUM loans,
the loan agreement required that the MAM loan proceeds be used for project purposes and
prohibited illegal and corrupt payments. The defendant ANTONIO DO ROSARIO signed
the loan agreement on behalf of MAM, and the defendant MANUEL CHANG signed the
government guarantee on behalf of Mozambique.

81. |The MAM loan agreement also provided that all payments required
under the agreement were to be made through a bank account in New York City at a New
York City-based financial institution (âNew York City Bank 2â), the identity of which is
known to the Grand Jury.

82. Onor about and between approximately May 23, 2014 and June 11,
2014, MAM borrowed approximately $535 million from Investment Bank 2, guaranteed by
the Republic of Mozambique, which Investment Bank 2 sent directly to Privinvest through
correspondent bank accounts at New York City Bank 2.

(2) MAM Bribe and Kickback Payments

83. An accounting spreadsheet maintained by the defendant NAJIB
ALLAM reflected that Privinvest made bribe and kickback payments to obtain the MAM
contract. Such payments included approximately $13 million to the defendant ANTONIO
DO ROSARIO, approximately $5 million to the defendant MANUEL CHANG,
approximately $918,000 to Mozambican Co-Conspirator 2 and approximately $1.8 million to

Mozambican Co-Conspirator 3.

29
84. Despite projecting approximately $63 million in operating revenues by
the end of its first year of operations, MAM generated virtually no revenues and defaulted on
its loan payment due on or about May 23, 2016.

F, EMATUM Exchange

85.  Inor about 2015, Proindicus, EMATUM, MAM and Mozambique
encountered problems servicing the approximately $2 billion in debt they had amassed in
2013 and 2014, including as a result of the Proindicus, EMATUM and MAM Loans.
Furthermore, at around the same time, Mozambican government officials, including the
defendant ANTONIO DO ROSARIO, received inquiries from the IMF concerning the use of
some of the loan proceeds.

86. To hide from the public and the IMF the near bankruptcy of the project
companies resulting from loan proceeds being diverted as part of the fraudulent scheme,
avoid inquiry from the IMF and conceal discovery of the scheme, several of the co-
conspirators, including the defendants JEAN BOUSTANI, ANDREW PEARSE and
DETELINA SUBEVA, proposed to exchange the EMATUM loan participation notes for
Eurobonds issued directly by the Mozambican government.

87. In furtherance of the fraudulent scheme, in or about and between March
2015 and May 2015, Investment Bank 1 employees, together with the defendants JEAN
BOUSTANI, ANDREW PEARSE and DETELINA SUBEVA, organized meetings with
Mozambican government officials to convince them to restructure the existing loans by
converting them into Eurobonds. The Mozambican government accepted the co-

conspiratorsâ recommendation and hired Investment Bank 1 and Investment Bank 2 to

30
tA
speck

conduct the exchange and Palomar, which employed PEARSE and SUBEVA, as an adviser
for the exchange.

88. Onor about March 9, 2016, Investment Bank 1 and Investment Bank 2
announced the exchange. To convince investors to exchange their loan participation notes
for Eurobonds, the defendants ANDREW PEARSE and DETELINA SUBEVA, together
with bankers at Investment Bank 1 and Investment Bank 2, prepared documents that were
sent to investors, including in the United States. The exchange documents failed to
adequately disclose the existence of the Proindicus and MAM Loans or the maturity dates of
those loans. The documents therefore contained false and misleading information about the
Eurobonds and Mozambiqueâs creditworthiness.

89. By onor about April 6, 2016, based upon the co-conspiratorsâ false and
misleading information, the EMATUM investors consented to the exchange, resulting in the

exchange of the EMATUM LPNs for Eurobonds on that same day.

G. Proindicus, EMATUM and MAM Loan Defaults

 

90. Following the 2016 EMATUM exchange, in or about and between May
2016 and March 2017, Proindicus, EMATUM and MAM each defaulted on their loans, and
Proindicus, EMATUM and MAM proceeded to miss more than $700 million in loan
payments.
H. Summary of Bribe and Kickback Payments
91. In furtherance of the fraudulent scheme, numerous Mozambican
government officials received bribe and kickback payments from Privinvest in connection

with the Mozambican projects. Specifically:

3]
(a) The defendant MANUEL CHANG received at least $5 million
in bribe and kickback payments from Privinvest.

(b) The defendant ANTONIO DO ROSARIO received at least
$12 million in bribe and kickback payments from Privinvest.

â(c) The defendant TEOFILO NHANGUMELE received at least

$8.5 million in bribe and kickback payments from Privinvest.

(d) | Mozambican Co-Conspirator 1 received at least $8.5 million in
bribe and kickback payments from Privinvest.

(ce) Mozambican Co-Conspirator 2 received at least $9.7 million in
bribe and kickback payments from Privinvest.

(f) Mozambican Co-Conspirator 3 received at least $2 million in
bribe and kickback payments from Privinvest.

92. The defendant JEAN BOUSTANI received approximately $15 million
from the proceeds of Privinvestâs fraudulent scheme. In or about and between May 2013
and July 2014, Privinvest paid BOUSTANI these funds in a series of wire transfers, many of
which were paid through a correspondent bank account in New York City and passed
through the Eastern District of New York.
93. Also in furtherance of the scheme, the defendants ANDREW PEARSE,

SURJAN SINGH and DETELINA SUBEVA received bribe and kickback payments in
connection with the Mozambican projects. Specifically:

(a) | The defendant ANDREW PEARSE received over $45 million
in bribe and kickback payments from Privinvest in connection with the Mozambican

maritime projects. Many of these bribe and kickback payments were paid through a

32
correspondent bank account in New York City and passed through the Eastern District of
New York.

(b) The defendant SURJAN SINGH received bribe and kickback
payments totaling approximately $4.5 million from Privinvest. At least one bribe and
kickback payment from Privinvest was paid through a correspondent account in New York
City and passed through the Eastern District of New York.

(c) The defendant DETELINA SUBEVA received bribe and
kickback payments of at least $2.2 million from the defendant ANDREW PEARSE.

(b)  Inor about February 2013, PEARSE, SINGH and SUBEVA
commissioned Due Diligence Firm 1 to advise on potential corruption and bribery risks

Bank 1 that the proposed loan increase was being used to make bribe and kickback payments
to the co-conspirators, including Mozambican government officials.

(e)  Onor about July 8, 2013, Privinvest made a payment of $1
million from its bank account in the UAE to a bank account in Portugal for the benefit of DO

and the Eastern District of New York.

(f) On or about July 27, 2013, PEARSE sent an email from his
personal email account to SUBEVA at her personal email account, stating: â[I]f you go into
the properties of each doc, it shows you as the author. You may want to delete and resendâ
the documents.

(g) On or about August 4, 2013, SUBEVA, using her personal
email account, sent an email to PEARSE at his personal email account that stated: â[A]s
promised, below is suggested âscriptâ for the DD [due diligence] meeting with the lady from
Ministry of Fisheries. These questions have been answered very well before so should
ensure a very productive low risk meeting. It overlaps well with the [Investment Bank 1]
list.â

(h) Onor about August 4, 2013, SUBEVA sent an email to DO
ROSARIO providing information for a due diligence meeting with Investment Bank 1

scheduled for the next day.

40
(i) On or about August 5, 2013, SUBEVA used her personal email
account to send PEARSE at his personal email account another due diligence script, which,
she explained, â[M]ay be helpful to go to S as it has gone to [DO ROSARIO] so he should be
prepared to handle the DD [due diligence] questions on competition, export plans and why
ADM [Abu Dhabi MAR] that are part of the list.â

(Gj) On or about August 5, 2013, SINGH traveled to Mozambique

approximately $500 million in EMATUM loan proceeds, less its fees, to Privinvest, which
payment passed through a correspondent bank account at New York City Bank 1 and the
Eastern District of New York.

(1) On or about October 23, 2013, Logistics International sent a
wire transfer of $1.175 million to a Mozambican bank account for the benefit of DO
ROSARIO, which payment passed through a correspondent bank account at New York City
Bank 1 and the Eastern District of New York.

(m) Onor about May 15, 2014, after receiving an email from a
member of the Investment Bank 1 deal team asking him to provide verification of
EMATUMâs bank account details, DO ROSARIO forwarded the request to PEARSE, who
responded: âI am trying to get hold of uncle [SINGH]. Donât have a call plse until I have
spoken with him and conformed wot the [expletive] this is about.â

(n)  Onor about the same day, May 15, 2014, after speaking with

SINGH, PEARSE wrote an email to DO ROSARIO and BOUSTANI, stating: âUncle is

sorting it out. There is some stupid UK regulatory requirement .... In any event I told
him to tell [an Investment Bank 1 employee who made the initial request], that she is fired if
she doesnât behave in the future!â

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Thursday, March 7, 2019

Mozambiqueâs Former Finance Minister Indicted Alongside Other Former Mozambican Officials,
Business Executives, and Investment Bankers in Alleged $2 Billion Fraud and Money Laundering
Scheme that Victimized U.S. Investors

More Than $200 Million in Alleged Bribes and Kickbacks Paid to Mozambican Government Officials and
Investment Bankers in Corrupt Maritime Loans for Mozambique

A four-count indictment was returned on Dec. 19, 2018, by a grand jury in the Eastern District of New York, charging two executives of a
shipbuilding company, three former senior Mozambican government officials, and three former London-based investment bankers for their roles
in a $2 billion fraud and money laundering scheme that victimized investors from the United States and elsewhere.

Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Richard P. Donoghue of the Eastern
District of New York, and Assistant Director in Charge William F. Sweeney Jr. of the FBIâs New York Field Office made the announcement.

âThe indictment unsealed today alleges a brazen international criminal scheme in which corrupt Mozambique government officials, corporate
executives, and investment bankers stole approximately $200 million in loan proceeds that were meant to benefit the people of Mozambique,â
said Assistant Attorney General Benczkowski. âThe Department of Justice and our law enforcement partners are dedicated to using all tools at
our disposal to prosecute those who engage in money laundering, financial fraud and corruption at the expense of U.S. investors, wherever
those individuals may be located.â

âAs charged in the indictment, the defendants orchestrated an immense fraud and bribery scheme that took advantage of the U.S. financial
system, defrauded its investors and adversely impacted the economy of Mozambique, in order to line their own pockets with hundreds of
millions of dollars,â said U.S. Attorney Donoghue. âThis indictment underscores the Department of Justiceâs continuing efforts to end such
fraudulent and corrupt practices and to hold those responsible to account for their crimes.â

âToday's indictment proves that no matter who you are, or what position of power you're in, you're not immune from prosecution,â said FBI
Assistant Director in Charge Sweeney. âThe FBI will continue to use all resources at our disposal to uncover crimes of this nature and expose
them for what they really are.â

Jean Boustani, 40, a citizen of Lebanon who worked for the Privinvest Group, a United Arab Emirates-based shipbuilding company, was arrested
at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York on Jan. 2, 2019 and arraigned later that day in the Eastern District of New York on charges that he
conspired with others to commit one count of wire fraud, one count of securities fraud, and one count of money laundering in connection with
$200 million in bribe and kickback payments he helped organize relating to three loans totaling more than $2 billion that were marketed and
sold to U.S. victim investors. Boustani has pleaded not guilty to the charges; a trial date has not yet been set. Alongside Boustani, Privinvestâs
chief financial officer Najib Allam, 58, a citizen of Lebanon, was charged with the same counts. Allam is alleged to have worked with Boustani to
make the bribe and kickback payments. Allam is not currently in U.S. custody.

Manuel Chang, 63, the former Mozambican minister of finance who is a citizen and resident of Mozambique, was charged with the same counts
as Boustani, namely one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, and one count of
conspiracy to commit money laundering. Chang was arrested at the request of the United States by South African authorities on Dec. 29,
2018. The United States is seeking Changâs extradition.

Antonio do Rosario, 44, a citizen and resident of Mozambique, was an official with Mozambiqueâs State Information and Security Service and a
director and officer of each of the three Mozambican entities that obtained the maritime loans. Do Rosario was charged with one count of
conspiracy to commit wire fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering
in connection with his receipt of bribe payments relating to the loans. Do Rosario is not currently in U.S. custody.

Teofilo Nhangumele, 50, a citizen and resident of Mozambique, acted on behalf of the Office of the President of Mozambique. Nhangumele was
charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering in connection with his
negotiation and receipt of bribe payments relating to the loans. Nhangumele is not currently in U.S. custody.

The three investment bankers, Andrew Pearse, 49; Surjan Singh, 44; and Detelina Subeva, 37, each of whom is a resident of the United
Kingdom, were also charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, and one
count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. In addition, each banker was charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery
and internal controls provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) in connection with their roles in facilitating bribe payments to
government officials in Mozambique and for circumventing the internal accounting controls of a foreign investment bank that arranged two of
the loans. At the time, Pearse and Singh were managing directors of the investment bank, and Subeva was a vice president.

Pearse, Singh and Subeva were arrested on Jan. 3, in the United Kingdom, all pursuant to provisional arrest warrants issued at the request of
the United States. The United States is seeking their extradition.

The indictment alleges that between approximately 2013 and 2016, the co-conspirators organized for more than $2 billion in three loans to be
arranged by Investment Bank and another foreign bank. The loans were made to companies owned and controlled by the Mozambican
government: Proindicus S.A., Empresa Mocambicana de Atum, S.A. (EMATUM) and Mozambique Asset Management (MAM). The money was
purportedly to be used to fund three maritime projects for which the shipbuilder, Privinvest, would provide the equipment and services.
Proindicus was to perform coastal surveillance, EMATUM was to engage in tuna fishing, and MAM was to build and maintain shipyards. Chang,
in his capacity as minister of finance, signed guarantees on behalf of Mozambique for all three fraudulent loans. Singh signed the agreements
on behalf of the investment bank for the two loans on which the bank acted as primary arranger. The investment bank subsequently paid the
loans directly to Privinvest.

As further alleged in the indictment, the co-conspirators facilitated Privinvestâs criminal diversion of more than $200 million in loan proceeds,
including more than $150 million in bribe payments to Chang and other Mozambican government officials that Privinvest paid to ensure that
Mozambique would enter into the loan arrangements. In addition to the bribe payments, the alleged fraud also included approximately $50
million in kickback payments to Pearse, Singh, and Subeva, who assisted the conspirators to obtain financing for the loans through their
investment bank and a second foreign investment bank. Pearse, Singh, and Subeva, along with the other members of the conspiracy, allegedly
subsequently sold the loans to investors worldwide, including in the United States. Moreover, the participants in the scheme allegedly
conspired to defraud these investors by misrepresenting how the loan proceeds would be used, the amount and maturity dates of other loans
and debt Mozambique was obligated to pay, and the ability of Mozambique or its state-owned entities to repay the loans.

Mozambique and its state-owned entities have thus far allegedly failed to make more than $700 million of repayments that have become due
on the loans.

The charges in the indictment are merely allegations, and the defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt
in a court of law.

The investigation is being conducted by the FBIâs New York Field Office. The governmentâs case is being prosecuted by the Criminal Divisionâs
Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section (MLARS) and Fraud Section, and the Business and Securities Fraud Section of the U.S. Attorney's
Office for the Eastern District of New York. MLARS Trial Attorneys Sean W. O'Donnell and Margaret A. Moeser, Fraud Section Trial Attorney
David M. Fuhr, and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Matthew S. Amatruda and Mark E. Bini of the Eastern District of New York are prosecuting the case.

The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs provided critical assistance in this case. The Department appreciates the significant
cooperation and assistance provided by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Department also appreciates the assistance provided by
law enforcement authorities in the United Kingdom and in South Africa.

MLARS'âs Bank Integrity Unit investigates and prosecutes banks and other financial institutions, including their officers, managers, and
employees, whose actions threaten the integrity of the individual institution or the wider financial system.

The Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice
Departmentâs FCPA enforcement efforts can be found at www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.

Defendant Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft (the âCompanyâ), pursuant to authority
granted by the Companyâs Management Board reflected in Attachment B, and the United States
Department of Justice, Criminal Division, Fraud Section (the âFraud Sectionâ) and Money
Laundering and Asset Recovery Section (âMLARSââ), and the United States Attorneyâs Office for
the Eastern District of New York (collectively, the âOfficesâ) enter into this Deferred Prosecution
Agreement (the âAgreementâ).

Criminal Information and Acceptance of Responsibility

1. The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Offices will file the attached two-
count criminal Information in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York
charging the Company with: (1) one count of conspiracy to commit an offense against the United
States, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 371, that is, to violate: (a) the books
and records provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (âFCPAâ), as amended, Title 15,
United States Code, Sections 78m(b)(2)(A), 78m(b)(5), and 78ff(a); and (b) the internal controls
provisions of the FCPA, as amended, Title 15, United States Code, Sections 78m(b)(2)(B),

78m(b)(5), and 78ff(a); and (2) one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud affecting a financial
institution, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1349. In so doing, the Company:
(a) knowingly waives any right it may have to indictment on these charges, as well as all rights to
a speedy trial pursuant to the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, Title 18, United
States Code, Section 3161, and Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 48(b); and (b) knowingly
waives any objection with respect to venue to any charges by the United States arising out of the
conduct described in the Statement of Facts attached as Attachment A (âStatement of Factsâ) and
consents to the filing of the Information, as provided under the terms of this Agreement, in the
United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The Offices agree to defer
prosecution of the Company pursuant to the terms and conditions described below.

2. The Company admits, accepts, and acknowledges that it is responsible under United
States law for the acts of its officers, directors, employees, and agents as charged in the
Information, and as set forth in the Statement of Facts, and that the allegations described in the
Information and the facts described in the Statement of Facts are true and accurate. The Company
agrees that, effective as of the date the Company signs this Agreement, in any prosecution that is
deferred by this Agreement, it will not dispute the Statement of Facts set forth in this Agreement,
and, in any such prosecution, the Statement of Facts shall be admissible as: (a) substantive
evidence offered by the government in its case-in-chief and rebuttal case; (b) impeachment
evidence offered by the government on cross-examination; and (c) evidence at any sentencing
hearing or other hearing. In addition, in connection therewith, the Company agrees not to assert
any claim under the United States Constitution, Rule 410 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, Rule
11(f) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, Section 1B1.1(a) of the United States Sentencing
Guidelines (âU.S.S.G.â or âSentencing Guidelinesâ), or any other federal rule that the Statement

of Facts should be suppressed or is otherwise inadmissible as evidence in any form.

2
Term of the Agreement

3. This Agreement is effective for a period beginning on the date on which the
Information is filed and ending three years from that date (the âTermâ). The Company agrees,
however, that, in the event the Offices determine, in their sole discretion, that the Company has
knowingly violated any provision of this Agreement or has failed to completely perform or fulfill
each of the Companyâs obligations under this Agreement, an extension or extensions of the Term
may be imposed by the Offices, in their sole discretion, for up to a total additional time period of
one year, without prejudice to the Officesâ right to proceed as provided in Paragraphs 23 to 25
below. Any extension of the Agreement extends all terms of this Agreement, including the terms
of the reporting requirement in Attachment D, for an equivalent period. Conversely, in the event
the Offices find, in their sole discretion, that there exists a change in circumstances sufficient to
eliminate the need for the reporting requirement in Attachment D, and that the other provisions of
this Agreement have been satisfied, the Agreement may be terminated early. If the Court refuses
to grant exclusion of time under the Speedy Trial Act, Title 18, United States Code, Section
3161(h)(2), the Term shall be deemed to have not begun, and all the provisions of this Agreement
shall be deemed null and void, except that the statute of limitations for any prosecution relating to
the conduct described in the Statement of Facts shall be tolled from the date on which this
Agreement is signed until the date the Court refuses to grant the exclusion of time plus six months,
and except for the provisions contained within Paragraph 2 of this Agreement.

Relevant Considerations
4. The Offices enter into this Agreement based on the individual facts and

circumstances presented by this case and the Company, including:
a. the Company engaged in two separate and factually unrelated multiyear
criminal schemes, namely, the FCPA scheme charged in Count One of the Information, which was
investigated by the Offices, and the commodities trading scheme charged in Count Two of the
Information, which was separately investigated by the Fraud Section. For reasons of efficiency
and convenience, the Offices and the Company have agreed to resolve both investigations at the
same time in this case;

The FCPA Case

b. the Company did not receive voluntary disclosure credit pursuant to the
FCPA Corporate Enforcement Policy in the Department of Justice Manual 9-47.120, or pursuant
to the Sentencing Guidelines, because it did not voluntarily and timely self-disclose to the Offices
the FCPA conduct described in the Statement of Facts;

C. the Company received full credit for its cooperation with the FCPA
investigation conducted by the Offices, including making detailed factual presentations, providing
regular updates on the Companyâs internal investigation, highlighting key facts and documents,
making foreign-based employees available for interviews in the United States, and producing
extensive documentation to the Offices, including documents located in foreign jurisdictions;

d. the Company provided to the Offices all relevant facts known to it,
including information about the individuals involved in the conduct described in the Statement of
Facts and conduct disclosed to the Offices prior to the Agreement;

e. the Company engaged in remedial measures, including: conducting a robust
root cause analysis and taking substantial steps to remediate and address the misconduct, including
significantly enhancing its internal accounting controls, its anti-bribery and anti-corruption

program, and its Business Development Consultants (âBDCsâ) program on a global basis; making

4
a significant reduction in the number of BDCs used by the Company; imposing a requirement that
the Anti-Fraud, Bribery and Corruption function (âAFBCâ) approve, and a member of the
Management Board support, any new BDC arrangement; undertaking a review of BDCs on an
annual basis with involvement by representatives of AFBC; instituting enhanced due diligence
procedures and practices related to BDCs; and instituting enhanced anti-bribery training for
employees. The Company also undertook employment actions based on the findings, which
included disciplining and terminating certain employees;

f. the Companyâs 2015 Deferred Prosecution Agreement with the Fraud
Section and the Department of Justiceâs Antitrust Division for criminal violations in connection
with the Companyâs manipulation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (âLIBOR Resolutionâ),
including the guilty plea of a Company subsidiary, and the imposition of an independent
compliance monitorship in 2015, which is ongoing;

g. although the Company had inadequate anti-corruption controls and an
inadequate anti-corruption compliance program during the period of the conduct described in the
Statement of Facts, the Company has enhanced and has committed to continuing to enhance its
anti-bribery and anti-corruption program and internal controls, including ensuring that its
compliance program satisfies the minimum elements set forth in Attachment C to this Agreement
(Corporate Compliance Program);

h. based on the Companyâs remediation and the current state of its anti-
corruption compliance program, the Companyâs agreement to report to the Offices as set forth in
Attachment D to this Agreement (Corporate Compliance Reporting), and the Companyâs
independent compliance monitor obligations in connection with the LIBOR Resolution, the
Offices determined that an independent compliance monitor was unnecessary;

5
1. the nature and seriousness of the offense conduct, as described in the
Statement of Facts, including making corrupt payments to BDCs, the willful falsification of books
and records to conceal those improper payments, and the willful failure to implement an adequate
system of internal controls;

j. the Companyâs contemporaneous parallel resolution with the USS.
Securities and Exchange Commission (âSECâ) through a cease-and-desist proceeding relating to
the corruption conduct described in the attached Statement of Facts, and the Companyâs agreement
to pay $35,145,619 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $8,184,003;

k. the Company has agreed to continue to cooperate with the Offices in any
ongoing investigation as described in Paragraph 5 below;

The Commodities Trading Case

 

I. the Company did not receive voluntary disclosure credit, because it did not
voluntarily and timely self-disclose to the Fraud Section the commodities trading conduct
described in the Statement of Facts;

m. the Company received full credit for its cooperation with the commodities
trading investigation conducted by the Fraud Section, including producing extensive
documentation in ways that did not implicate foreign data privacy laws;

n. the Company provided to the Fraud Section all relevant facts known to it,
including information about the individuals involved in the conduct described in the Statement of
Facts and conduct disclosed to the Fraud Section prior to the Agreement;

O. although negotiations to resolve the commodities trading investigation did
not begin until late October 2020, the Company promptly accepted responsibility and agreed to

resolve the investigation;
p. all of the commodities trading conduct described in the Statement of Facts
preceded the Companyâs 2015 Deferred Prosecution Agreement with the Fraud Section and the
Department of Justiceâs Antitrust Division for criminal violations in connection with the LIBOR
resolution, which also involved manipulative and deceptive trading practices, and the imposition
of an independent compliance monitorship in 2015, which is ongoing;

q. although the Company had inadequate commodities trading controls and an
inadequate commodities trading compliance program during the period of the conduct described
in the Statement of Facts, the Company has enhanced and has committed to continuing to enhance
its commodities trading compliance program and internal controls under the independent
compliance monitorship;

r. the nature and seriousness of the offense conduct, as described in the
Statement of Facts, including many instances of unlawful trading in precious metals futures
contracts by five traders on three continents between approximately 2008 and 2013, resulting in at
least $1,223,738 of loss to other futures market participants and significant harm to the integrity
of core U.S. commodities markets;

S. the Companyâs prior resolution with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission (âCFTCâ) on January 29, 2018, through a proceeding and order relating to the
commodities trading conduct described in the attached Statement of Facts, and the Companyâs
payment of a $30 million civil monetary penalty; and

t. the Company has agreed to continue to cooperate with the Offices in any
ongoing investigation as described in Paragraph 5 below;

U. accordingly, after considering (a) through (t) above, the Offices believe that
the appropriate resolution in this case is a Deferred Prosecution Agreement with the Company; a

7
criminal monetary penalty in the amount of $79,561,206 for the conduct related to violations of
the FCPA accounting provisions, and a criminal monetary penalty in the amount of $5,625,000 for
the conduct related to commodities trading in violation of the wire fraud statute, which both reflect
a discount of twenty-five percent off the middle of the otherwise-applicable Sentencing Guidelines
fine range, rather than a discount off the bottom of the fine range, to reflect the Companyâs prior
similar misconduct; disgorgement of $681,480 and payment of $1,223,738 to compensate victims
relating to the commodities trading conduct; and the Companyâs agreement to report to the Offices
as set forth in Attachment D to this Agreement.
Future Cooperation and Disclosure Requirements

5. The Company shall cooperate fully with the Offices in any and all matters relating
to the conduct described in the Statement of Facts and other conduct under investigation by the
Offices at any time during the Term, subject to applicable laws and regulations, until the later of
the date upon which all investigations and prosecutions arising out of such conduct are concluded,
or the end of the Term. At the request of the Offices, the Company shall also cooperate fully with
other domestic or foreign law enforcement and regulatory authorities and agencies, as well as the
Multilateral Development Banks (âMDBsââ), in any investigation of the Company, its subsidiaries,
or its affiliates, or any of its present or former officers, directors, employees, agents, and
consultants, or any other party, in any and all matters relating to the conduct described in this
Agreement and the Statement of Facts and other conduct under investigation by the Offices. The
Companyâs cooperation pursuant to this Paragraph is subject to applicable law and regulations, as
well as valid claims of attorney-client privilege or attorney work product doctrine; however, the
Company must provide to the Offices a log of any information or cooperation that is not provided

based on an assertion of law, regulation, or privilege, and the Company bears the burden of

8
establishing the validity of any such assertion. The Company agrees that its cooperation pursuant
to this paragraph shall include, but not be limited to, the following:

a. The Company shall truthfully disclose all factual information with respect
to its activities, those of its subsidiaries, and affiliates, and those of its present and former directors,
officers, employees, agents, and consultants, including any evidence or allegations and internal or
external investigations, about which the Company has any knowledge or about which the Offices
may inquire. This obligation of truthful disclosure includes, but is not limited to, the obligation of
the Company to provide to the Offices, upon request, any document, record or other tangible
evidence about which the Offices may inquire of the Company.

b. Upon request of the Offices, the Company shall designate knowledgeable
employees, agents or attorneys to provide to the Offices the information and materials described
in Paragraph 5(a) above on behalf of the Company. It is further understood that the Company
must at all times provide complete, truthful, and accurate information.

C. The Company shall use its best efforts to make available for interviews or
testimony, as requested by the Offices, present or former officers, directors, employees, agents and
consultants of the Company. This obligation includes, but is not limited to, sworn testimony before
a federal grand jury or in federal trials, as well as interviews with domestic or foreign law
enforcement and regulatory authorities. Cooperation under this Paragraph shall include
identification of witnesses who, to the knowledge of the Company, may have material information
regarding the matters under investigation.

d. With respect to any information, testimony, documents, records or other
tangible evidence provided to the Offices pursuant to this Agreement, the Company consents to

any and all disclosures, subject to applicable laws and regulations, to other governmental

9
authorities, including United States authorities and those of a foreign government, as well as the
MDBs, of such materials as the Offices, in their sole discretion, shall deem appropriate.

6. In addition to the obligations in Paragraph 5, during the Term, should the Company
learn of any evidence or allegation of conduct that may constitute a violation of the FCPA anti-
bribery or accounting provisions had the conduct occurred within the jurisdiction of the United
States, the Company shall promptly report such evidence or allegation to the Offices.

Total Criminal Monetary Amount

7. The Offices and the Company agree that the Total Criminal Monetary Amount to
be paid by the Company pursuant to this Agreement is $87,091,424, which is comprised of the
following components set forth below: (1) a criminal monetary penalty of $79,561,206 relating to
the FCPA conduct, as well as a criminal monetary penalty of $5,625,000 relating to the
commodities trading conduct; (2) a Criminal Disgorgement Amount of $681,480 relating to the
commodities trading conduct; and (3) and payment of $1,223,738 to compensate victims of the
commodities trading conduct for their losses as set forth in Paragraph 4(u) above (hereafter, the
âVictim Compensation Amountâ).

8. The Offices agree that the criminal monetary penalty of $5,625,000 relating to the
commodities trading conduct is fully credited against the $30 million civil monetary penalty
imposed on the Company by the CFTC in connection with the CFTCâs January 29, 2018
proceeding and order.

Payment of Criminal Monetary Penalty

9. With respect to the FCPA conduct in the Statement of Facts, the Offices and the

Company agree that application of the Sentencing Guidelines to determine the applicable fine

range yields the following analysis:

10
a. The November 1, 2018 version of the Sentencing Guidelines is applicable
to this matter.

b. Offense Level. Based upon U.S.S.G. Â§ 2B1.1, the total offense level is 30,
calculated as follows:

d. Culpability Score. Based upon U.S.S.G. Â§ 8C2.5, the culpability score is
10, calculated as follows:

(a) Base Culpability Score 5

(b)(1) The organization had 5,000 or more
employees and tolerance of the offense by substantial
authority personnel was pervasive throughout the
organization +5

(c)(2) The organization committed part of the instant

offense less than 5 years after a criminal adjudication

based on similar misconduct +2

recognition and affirmative acceptance of

responsibility for its criminal conduct -2

Base Fine $35,360,536
Multipliers 2(min)/4(max)

Fine Range $70,721,072 /$141,442,144
The Company agrees to pay a total criminal monetary penalty in the amount of $79,561,206 (the
âTotal Criminal Monetary Penaltyâ). This reflects a twenty-five percent discount off the middle
of the applicable Sentencing Guidelines fine range. The Total Criminal Monetary Penalty will be
paid to the United States Treasury within ten business days of the execution of this Agreement, of
which $20,000,000 will be paid to the United States Postal Inspection Service Consumer Fraud
Fund. The Company and the Offices agree that this penalty is appropriate given the facts and
circumstances of this case, including the Relevant Considerations described in Paragraph 4 of this
Agreement. The Total Criminal Monetary Penalty is final and shall not be refunded. Furthermore,
nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed an agreement by the Offices that the Total Criminal
Monetary Penalty is the maximum penalty that may be imposed in any future prosecution, and the
Offices are not precluded from arguing in any future prosecution that the Court should impose a
higher fine, although the Offices agree that under those circumstances, they will recommend to the
Court that any amount paid under this Agreement should be offset against any fine the Court
imposes as part of a future judgment. The Company acknowledges that no tax deduction may be
sought in connection with the payment of any part of the Total Criminal Monetary Penalty. The
Company shall not seek or accept directly or indirectly reimbursement or indemnification from
any source with regard to the penalty or disgorgement amounts that the Company pays pursuant
to this Agreement or any other agreement entered into with an enforcement authority or regulator

concerning the facts set forth in the Statement of Facts.

Offices and the Company agree that application of the Sentencing Guidelines to determine the
applicable fine range yields the following analysis:

a. The November 1, 2018 version of the Sentencing Guidelines is applicable
to this matter.!

b. Offense Level. Based upon U.S.S.G. Â§ 2B1.1, the total offense level is 25,
calculated as follows:

C. Base Fine. Based upon U.S.S.G. Â§ 8C2.4(a)(1), the base fine is $5,000,000
(the fine indicated in the Offense Level Fine Table)

d. Culpability Score. Based upon U.S.S.G. Â§ 8C2.5, the culpability score is 5,
calculated as follows:

(a) Base Culpability Score 5

(b)(4) The relevant unit had 50 or more employees
and an individual within substantial authority
personnel participated in, condoned, or
was willfully ignorant of the offense +2

(g)(2) The organization cooperated in the
investigation, and clearly demonstrated
recognition and affirmative acceptance of
responsibility for its criminal conduct -2

 

' Application of the version of the Sentencing Guidelines that was in effect at the time of the
commodities trading conduct described in the Statement of Facts would result in a higher total
offense level and base fine amount. See U.S.S.G. Â§ I1B1.11.

Calculation of Fine Range:

 

Base Fine $5,000,000
Multipliers (U.S.S.G. Â§ 8C2.6) 1(min)/2(max)
Fine Range $5,000,000 / $10,000,000

The Offices have determined that a criminal monetary penalty in the amount of $5,625,000 (the
âCommodities Criminal Monetary Penaltyâ) is appropriate as to the commodities trading conduct.
The Commodities Criminal Monetary Penalty reflects a twenty-five percent discount off the
middle of the applicable Sentencing Guidelines fine range. However, as noted above, the Offices
are fully crediting the Commodities Criminal Monetary Penalty against the $30 million civil
monetary penalty imposed by the CFTC in connection with its January 29, 2018 proceeding and
order.
Payment of Criminal Disgorgement Amount

11. The Company hereby agrees to disgorge to the United States the sum of $681,480
(the âCriminal Disgorgement Amountâ). The Criminal Disgorgement Amount has been calculated
by the Offices based on the unlawful trading profits for the commodities trading conduct described
in the Statement of Facts. The Company shall pay the Criminal Disgorgement Amount no later
than ten (10) business days after the Agreement is fully executed, pursuant to payment instructions
provided by the Offices in their sole discretion.

12. The Criminal Disgorgement Amount paid is final and shall not be refunded should
the Offices later determine that the Company has breached this Agreement and commence a
prosecution against the Company. In the event of a breach of this Agreement and subsequent

prosecution, the Offices may pursue additional civil and criminal forfeiture in excess of the

14
Criminal Disgorgement Amount. The Offices agree that in the event of a subsequent breach and
prosecution, they will recommend to the Court that the amounts paid pursuant to this Agreement
be offset against whatever forfeiture the Court shall impose as part of its judgment. The Company
understands that such a recommendation will not be binding on the Court.

Payment of Victim Compensation Amount

13. The Company agrees to pay the Victim Compensation Amount, which is
$1,223,738. The Company shall establish an escrow account and deposit the full Victim
Compensation Amount into the escrow account no later than ten (10) business days after the
Agreement is signed.

14. The Company agrees to disburse victim compensation payments from the escrow
account directly to identified victims according to instructions provided by the Fraud Section in
the Fraud Sectionâs sole discretion.

15. The Company agrees that any part of the Victim Compensation Amount that
remains unclaimed twelve (12) months after the execution of this Agreement shall revert to the
United States in the form of an additional criminal monetary penalty, and to pay such additional
criminal monetary payment to the United States pursuant to payment instructions provided by the
Fraud Section in its sole discretion.

Conditional Release from Liability

16. Subject to Paragraphs 23 to 25, the Offices agree, except as provided in this
Agreement, that they will not bring any criminal or civil case against the Company or any of its
branches, representative offices or direct or indirect affiliates, or joint ventures relating to any of
the conduct described in the Statement of Facts or the criminal Information filed pursuant to this

Agreement. The Offices, however, may use any information related to the conduct described in

15
the Statement of Facts against the Company: (a) in a prosecution for perjury or obstruction of
justice; (b) in a prosecution for making a false statement; (c) in a prosecution or other proceeding
relating to any crime of violence; or (d) in a prosecution or other proceeding relating to a violation
of any provision of Title 26 of the United States Code.

a. This Agreement does not provide any protection against prosecution for any
future conduct by the Company.

b. In addition, this Agreement does not provide any protection against
prosecution of any individuals, regardless of their affiliation with the Company.

Corporate Compliance Program
17. The Company represents that it has implemented and will continue to implement a

compliance and ethics program designed to prevent and detect violations of the FCPA and other
applicable anti-corruption laws throughout its operations, including those of its affiliates,
subsidiaries, agents, and joint ventures, and those of its contractors and subcontractors whose
responsibilities include interacting with foreign officials or other activities carrying a high risk of
corruption, including, but not limited to, the minimum elements set forth in Attachment C. In
order to address any deficiencies in its internal accounting controls, policies, and procedures, the
Company represents that it has undertaken, and will continue to undertake in the future, in a
manner consistent with all of its obligations under this Agreement, a review of its existing internal
accounting controls, policies, and procedures, regarding compliance with the FCPA and other
applicable anti-corruption laws. Where necessary and appropriate, the Company agrees to adopt
anew compliance program, or to modify its existing one, including internal controls, compliance
policies, and procedures in order to ensure that it maintains: (a) an effective system of internal

accounting controls designed to ensure the making and keeping of fair and accurate books, records,

16
and accounts; and (b) a rigorous anti-corruption compliance program that incorporates relevant
internal accounting controls, as well as policies and procedures designed to effectively detect and
deter violations of the FCPA and other applicable anti-corruption laws. The compliance program,
including the internal accounting controls system will include, but not be limited to, the minimum
elements set forth in Attachment C.
Corporate Compliance Reporting

18. The Company agrees that it will report to the Offices annually during the Term
regarding remediation and implementation of the compliance measures described in Attachment
C. These reports will be prepared in accordance with Attachment D.

Deferred Prosecution

19. In consideration of the undertakings agreed to by the Company herein, the Offices
agree that any prosecution of the Company for the conduct set forth in the Statement of Facts be
and hereby is deferred for the Term. To the extent there is conduct disclosed by the Company that
is not set forth in the Statement of Facts, such conduct will not be exempt from further prosecution
and is not within the scope of or relevant to this Agreement.

20. The Offices further agree that if the Company fully complies with all of its
obligations under this Agreement, the Offices will not continue the criminal prosecution against
the Company described in Paragraph 1 and, at the conclusion of the Term, this Agreement shall
expire. Within six months after the Agreementâs expiration, the Offices shall seek dismissal with
prejudice of the criminal Information filed against the Company described in Paragraph 1, and
agree not to file charges in the future against the Company based on the conduct described in this
Agreement and the Statement of Facts. If, however, the Offices determine during this six-month
period that the Company breached the Agreement during the Term, as described in Paragraph 23,

17
the Officeâs ability to extend the Term, as described in Paragraph 3, or to pursue other remedies,
including those described in Paragraphs 23 to 25, remains in full effect.
Breach of the Agreement

21. If, during the Term, the Company (a) commits any felony under United States
federal law; (b) provides in connection with this Agreement deliberately false, incomplete, or
misleading information, including in connection with its disclosure of information about individual
culpability; (c) fails to cooperate as set forth in Paragraphs 5 and 6 of this Agreement; (d) fails to
implement a compliance program as set forth in Paragraphs 18 and 19 of this Agreement and
Attachment C; (e) commits any acts that, had they occurred within the jurisdictional reach of the
FCPA, would be a violation of the FCPA; or (f) otherwise fails to completely perform or fulfill
each of the Companyâs obligations under the Agreement, regardless of whether the Offices become
aware of such a breach after the Term is complete, the Company shall thereafter be subject to
prosecution for any federal criminal violation of which the Offices have knowledge, including, but
not limited to, the charges in the Information described in Paragraph 1, which may be pursued by
the Offices in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York or any other
appropriate venue. Determination of whether the Company has breached the Agreement and
whether to pursue prosecution of the Company shall be in the Officesâ sole discretion. Any such
prosecution may be premised on information provided by the Company or its personnel. Any such
prosecution relating to the conduct described in the Statement of Facts or relating to conduct
known to the Offices prior to the date on which this Agreement was signed that is not time-barred
by the applicable statute of limitations on the date of the signing of this Agreement may be
commenced against the Company, notwithstanding the expiration of the statute of limitations,

between the signing of this Agreement and the expiration of the Term plus one year. Thus, by

18
signing this Agreement, the Company agrees that the statute of limitations with respect to any such
prosecution that is not time-barred on the date of the signing of this Agreement shall be tolled for
the Term plus one year. In addition, the Company agrees that the statute of limitations as to any
violation of federal law that occurs during the Term will be tolled from the date upon which the
violation occurs until the earlier of the date upon which the Offices are made aware of the violation
or the duration of the Term plus five years, and that this period shall be excluded from any
calculation of time for purposes of the application of the statute of limitations.

22. In the event the Offices determine that the Company has breached this Agreement,
the Offices agree to provide the Company with written notice of such breach prior to instituting
any prosecution resulting from such breach. Within thirty days of receipt of such notice, the
Company shall have the opportunity to respond to the Offices in writing to explain the nature and
circumstances of such breach, as well as the actions the Company has taken to address and
remediate the situation, which explanation the Offices shall consider in determining whether to
pursue prosecution of the Company.

23. In the event the Offices determine that the Company has breached this Agreement:
(a) all statements made by or on behalf of the Company to the Offices or to the Court, including
the Statement of Facts, and any testimony given by the Company before a grand jury, a court, or
any tribunal, or at any legislative hearings, whether prior or subsequent to this Agreement, and any
leads derived from such statements or testimony, shall be admissible in evidence in any and all
criminal proceedings brought by the Offices against the Company; and (b) the Company shall not
assert any claim under the United States Constitution, Rule 11(f) of the Federal Rules of Criminal
Procedure, Rule 410 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, or any other federal rule that any such

statements or testimony made by or on behalf of the Company prior or subsequent to this

19
Agreement, or any leads derived therefrom, should be suppressed or are otherwise inadmissible.
The decision whether conduct or statements of any current director, officer or employee, or any
person acting on behalf of, or at the direction of, the Company, will be imputed to the Company
for the purpose of determining whether the Company has violated any provision of this Agreement
shall be in the sole discretion of the Offices.

24. The Company acknowledges that the Offices have made no representations,
assurances, or promises concerning what sentence may be imposed by the Court if the Company
breaches this Agreement and this matter proceeds to judgment. The Company further
acknowledges that any such sentence is solely within the discretion of the Court and that nothing
in this Agreement binds or restricts the Court in the exercise of such discretion.

25. On the date that the period of deferred prosecution specified in this Agreement
expires, the Company, by the Chief Executive Officer of the Company and the Chief Financial
Officer of the Company, will certify to the Offices, in the form of executing the document attached
as Attachment E to this Agreement, that the Company has met its disclosure obligations pursuant
to Paragraph 6 of this Agreement. Each certification will be deemed a material statement and
representation by the Company to the executive branch of the United States for purposes of 18
U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1001 and 1519, and it will be deemed to have been made in the judicial district in which
this Agreement is filed.

Sale, Merger, or Other Change in Corporate Form of Company

26. Except as may otherwise be agreed by the parties in connection with a particular
transaction, the Company agrees that in the event that, during the Term, it undertakes any change
in corporate form, including if it sells, merges, or transfers business operations that are material to

the Companyâs consolidated operations, or to the operations of any subsidiaries or affiliates

20
involved in the conduct described in the Statement of Facts, as they exist as of the date of this
Agreement, whether such sale is structured as a sale, asset sale, merger, transfer, or other change
in corporate form, it shall include in any contract for sale, merger, transfer, or other change in
corporate form a provision binding the purchaser, or any successor in interest thereto, to the
obligations described in this Agreement. The purchaser or successor in interest must also agree in
writing that the Officeâs ability to determine a breach under this Agreement is applicable in full
force to that entity. The Company agrees that the failure to include these provisions in the
transaction will make any such transaction null and void. The Company shall provide notice to
the Offices at least thirty (30) days prior to undertaking any such sale, merger, transfer, or other
change in corporate form. The Offices shall notify the Company prior to such transaction (or series
of transactions) if it determines that the transaction(s) will have the effect of circumventing or
frustrating the enforcement purposes of this Agreement. If at any time during the Term the
Company engages in a transaction(s) that has the effect of circumventing or frustrating the
enforcement purposes of this Agreement, the Offices may deem it a breach of this Agreement
pursuant to Paragraphs 23 to 25 of this Agreement. Nothing herein shall restrict the Company
from indemnifying (or otherwise holding harmless) the purchaser or successor in interest for
penalties or other costs arising from any conduct that may have occurred prior to the date of the
transaction, so long as such indemnification does not have the effect of circumventing or
frustrating the enforcement purposes of this Agreement, as determined by the Offices.
Public Statements by Company

27. The Company expressly agrees that it shall not, through present or future attorneys,

officers, directors, employees, agents or any other person authorized to speak for the Company

make any public statement, in litigation or otherwise, contradicting the acceptance of responsibility

21
by the Company set forth above or the facts described in the Statement of Facts. Any such
contradictory statement shall, subject to cure rights of the Company described below, constitute a
breach of this Agreement, and the Company thereafter shall be subject to prosecution as set forth
in Paragraphs 23 to 25 of this Agreement. The decision whether any public statement by any such
person contradicting a fact contained in the Statement of Facts will be imputed to the Company
for the purpose of determining whether it has breached this Agreement shall be at the sole
discretion of the Offices. If the Offices determine that a public statement by any such person
contradicts in whole or in part a statement contained in the Statement of Facts, the Offices shall so
notify the Company, and the Company may avoid a breach of this Agreement by publicly
repudiating such statement(s) within five business days after notification. The Company shall be
permitted to raise defenses and to assert affirmative claims in other proceedings relating to the
matters set forth in the Statement of Facts provided that such defenses and claims do not contradict,
in whole or in part, a statement contained in the Statement of Facts. This Paragraph does not apply
to any statement made by any present or former officer, director, employee, or agent of the
Company in the course of any criminal, regulatory, or civil case initiated against such individual,
unless such individual is speaking on behalf of the Company.

28. The Company agrees that if it, or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries or
affiliates, issues a press release or holds any press conference in connection with this Agreement,
the Company shall first consult with the Offices to determine (a) whether the text of the release or
proposed statements at the press conference are true and accurate with respect to matters between
the Offices and the Company; and (b) whether the Offices have any objection to the release.

29. The Offices agree, if requested to do so, to bring to the attention of law enforcement

and regulatory authorities the facts and circumstances relating to the nature of the conduct

22
underlying this Agreement, including the nature and quality of the Companyâs cooperation and
remediation. By agreeing to provide this information to such authorities, the Offices are not
agreeing to advocate on behalf of the Company, but rather are agreeing to provide facts to be
evaluated independently by such authorities.
Limitations on Binding Effect of Agreement

30. This Agreement is binding on the Company and the Offices but specifically does
not bind any other component of the Department of Justice, other federal agencies, or any state,
local or foreign law enforcement or regulatory agencies, or any other authorities, although the
Offices will bring the cooperation of the Company and its compliance with its other obligations
under this Agreement to the attention of such agencies and authorities if requested to do so by the
Company.

ATTACHMENT A
STATEMENT OF FACTS

The following Statement of Facts is incorporated by reference as part of the
Deferred Prosecution Agreement (the âAgreementâ) between the United States Department of
Justice, Criminal Division, Fraud Section (the âFraud Sectionâ) and Money Laundering and Asset
Recovery Section (âMLARSâ), and the United States Attorneyâs Office for the Eastern District of
New York (collectively, the âOfficesâ) and Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft (âDeutsche Bank
AGâ or the âCompanyâ). The Company hereby agrees and stipulates that the following
information is true and accurate. The Company admits, accepts, and acknowledges that it is
responsible for the acts of its officers, directors, employees, and agents as set forth below. Should
the Offices pursue the prosecution that is deferred by this Agreement, the Company agrees that it
will neither contest the admissibility of, nor contradict, this Statement of Facts in any such
proceeding. The following facts establish beyond a reasonable doubt the charges set forth in the
criminal Information attached to this Agreement:
I. THE FCPA SCHEME

The Defendant and Other Relevant Entities

1. From in or about and between 2009 and at least 2016 (the âRelevant FCPA
Periodâ), Deutsche Bank AG was a global investment bank and financial services company
headquartered in Frankfurt, Germany. Deutsche Bank AG operated globally through subsidiaries,

branches and affiliates (collectively with Deutsche Bank AG, âDeutsche Bankâ),' and it employed

 

' Where Deutsche Bank AG and its subsidiaries, multiple subsidiaries, or employees from
multiple Deutsche Bank AG entities are discussed herein, âDeutsche Bankâ is used to describe
the actors.

1
during that time approximately 100,000 employees and agents in 62 countries. At all relevant
times, Deutsche Bank AG had shares of stock traded on the New York Stock Exchange and was
required to file periodic reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (âSECâ)
pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Title 15, United States Code,
Section 780(d). Accordingly, during the Relevant FCPA Period, Deutsche Bank AG was an
âissuerâ as that term is used in the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (âFCPAâ), as amended,
Title 15, United States Code, Sections 78dd-1 and 78m(b).
Overview of the Criminal FCPA Scheme

2. During the Relevant FCPA Period, Deutsche Bank contracted with third-
party intermediaries, which it called âBusiness Development Consultantsâ or âBDCs,â to obtain
and retain business globally. The BDCs were approved by then-high-level Deutsche Bank
management and various regional committees.

False Books and Records

3. Beginning in or about at least 2009 through in or about at least 2016,
Deutsche Bank AG, acting through its employees and agents, knowingly and willfully conspired
and agreed with others to maintain false books, records, and accounts that did not accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of Deutsche Bank AGâs assets, by, among other
things, (1) falsely concealing bribes paid to a clientâs decistonmaker in Saudi Arabia to retain that
clientâs business by recording the payments as âreferral feesâ paid to a BDC; and (2) falsely
concealing millions of dollars of payments made to an intermediary acting as a proxy for a foreign

official in Abu Dhabi by recording the payments as âconsultancyâ payments to a BDC.
Failure to Implement and Maintain Internal Accounting Controls

4. During the Relevant FCPA Period, Deutsche Bank AG, acting through its
employees and agents, knowingly and willfully failed to implement and maintain a system of
internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the execution of transactions in accordance with managementâs
authorization, and which would have helped detect and stop Deutsche Bank from continuing to
make corrupt payments to and through BDCs.

5. As further detailed herein, Deutsche Bank AG, acting through its employees
and agents, knowingly and willfully conspired and agreed with others to fail to implement and
maintain sufficient internal accounting controls related to payments to BDCs, including by, among
other things, failing to conduct meaningful due diligence regarding BDCs, making payments to
certain BDCs who were not under contract with Deutsche Bank AG at the time, and making
payments to certain BDCs without invoices or adequate documentation of the services purportedly
performed. Certain Deutsche Bank AG employees and agents also created, and helped BDCs to
create, false justifications and documentation necessary for payment approval.

6. During the Relevant FCPA Period and as a result of the above-described
FCPA scheme, Deutsche Bank AG made approximately $35,360,536 in profits from transactions
related to three specific BDCs detailed further herein.

Deutsche Bank AGâs Failure to Implement Adequate Controls in Response
to Red Flags Related to BDCs

7. In or about 2009, a group within Deutsche Bank AGâs internal audit
function conducted a targeted review of âbusiness arrangements that could be associated with

corruptionâ in Deutsche Bankâs Corporate Finance operations in the Asia-Pacific region. In 2009,
the internal audit group issued a report identifying ârisk indicatorsâ and highlighting concerns with
Deutsche Bankâs use of, and payments to, BDCs, including lack of oversight to ensure BDCs were
not used for corrupt purposes and lack of documentation supporting the actual services rendered.
The report made numerous recommendations regarding the use and payment of BDCs and
recommended that Deutsche Bank AGâs global BDC policy be updated accordingly. The report
was distributed to high-level management at Deutsche Bank AG, including members of Deutsche
Bank AGâs Management Board. However, Deutsche Bank AG failed to implement additional
controls sufficient to address the issues identified in the report.

8. In or about 2011, the internal audit group conducted another internal review
of BDC relationships at Deutsche Bank as part of the Deutsche Bank AGâs global anti-corruption
program and identified numerous ongoing control failures regarding BDCs. It found, among other
things: deficiencies in the due diligence conducted by Deutsche Bank employees on BDCs; failure
by Deutsche Bank to appropriately document, mitigate, and manage anti-corruption risks
associated with multiple BDCs; and failure by Deutsche Bank to document the proportionality of,
and justifications for, payments to BDCs. The internal audit groupâs 2011 report, which was also
distributed to high-level management at Deutsche Bank AG including members of Deutsche Bank
AGâs Management Board, made additional recommendations for internal controls improvements
in the BDC program. Nevertheless, Deutsche Bank continued to approve engagements of, and

payments to, BDCs without implementing additional controls.
Falsification of Records and Failures to Implement Controls in Connection
with Corrupt Payments in Abu Dhabi

9. In or about 2010, Deutsche Bank contracted with a BDC based in Abu
Dhabi (âthe Abu Dhabi BDCâ)â to obtain business with an investment vehicle indirectly owned by
the government of Abu Dhabi (âthe Abu Dhabi SOEâ). The deal was known internally at Deutsche
Bank AG as âProject X.â

10. Prior to entering into a contractual relationship with the Abu Dhabi BDC,
certain Deutsche Bank AG bankers, including at least four Managing Directors of Deutsche Bank
AG who also held high-level regional and functional positions at Deutsche Bank, knew that: (1)
the Abu Dhabi BDC was a relative of a high-ranking official of, and a decision-maker for, the Abu
Dhabi SOE and its parent entity (âthe Abu Dhabi SOE Officialâ); (2) the Abu Dhabi BDC was
acting as a proxy for the Abu Dhabi SOE Official; and (3) paying BDC fees to the Abu Dhabi
BDC was a requirement for Deutsche Bank to obtain the Project X business from the Abu Dhabi
SOE.

11. For example, on or about April 24, 2010, an executive of Deutsche Bank,
who was also a Managing Director of Deutsche Bank AG (âDeutsche Bank AG Managing Director
1â), emailed a regional Deutsche Bank executive, who was also a Managing Director of Deutsche
Bank AG, explaining that â[the Abu Dhabi BDC] confirms he is behind [the Abu Dhabi SOE

Official].â

 

* The identity of the Abu Dhabi BDC and all other anonymized entities, individuals and projects
discussed herein are known to the Company and the Offices.
5
12. Similarly, in a meeting report dated on or about March 11, 2010, another
Deutsche Bank AG Managing Director sent an email to Deutsche Bank AG Managing Director 1
stating that the Abu Dhabi BDC âreally is the gate keeper to [the Abu Dhabi SOE Official].â

13. Deutsche Bank AG Managing Director 1 also made it clear to others at
Deutsche Bank that approving the Abu Dhabi BDCâs contract was necessary to close the deal for
Project X.

14. For example, on or about May 18, 2010, Deutsche Bank AG Managing
Director 1 emailed another Deutsche Bank AG Managing Director, who was the head of a regional
business line, stating, âWe need to close the [Abu Dhabi BDC] angle within the next 48hrs. Need
ur [sic] leadership and influence on getting it thru GMRAC.â

15. The Abu Dhabi BDCâs engagement was considered and approved by the
Global Markets Risk Assessment Committee (ââGMRACââ), which included high-ranking Deutsche
Bank employees from multiple Deutsche Bank AG subsidiaries and divisions, including a high-
ranking employee in Deutsche Bankâs regional Legal and Compliance function. Documentation
reflecting the GMRAC process shows that committee members approved the BDC relationship
despite indicia of corruption related to the engagement of the Abu Dhabi BDC, including: (1) the
Abu Dhabi BDCâs relationship to government officials; (2) the Abu Dhabi BDCâs lack of
qualifications to serve as a BDC; (3) the indirect involvement of another intermediary (the âAbu
Dhabi Intermediaryâ), who was a relative of the Abu Dhabi BDC and business partner of the Abu
Dhabi SOE Official, and who had roles with several state-owned entities, including the parent
company of the Abu Dhabi SOE; and (4) the fact that the Abu Dhabi SOE Official was also

pressuring Deutsche Bank to finance a yacht in which the Abu Dhabi SOE Official had an
ownership interest (the âYachtâ) in exchange for winning additional business from the Abu Dhabi
SOE.

16. â Internal Deutsche Bank email communications show that close in time to
the GMRAC meetings about the Abu Dhabi BDC, the Abu Dhabi SOE Official pressed Deutsche
Bank to provide financing for the Yacht.

17. For example, on or about May 17, 2010, a subordinate of the Abu Dhabi
SOE Official sent an email to a Deutsche Bank AG Managing Director, copying the Abu Dhabi
SOE Official, which was then forwarded to Deutsche Bank AG Managing Director | and others
at Deutsche Bank. The email stated, â[Abu Dhabi SOE Official] has asked me to get in touch with
DB: reputationally, this financing is regarded as absolutely crucial, and [the Abu Dhabi SOE
Official] made the point very forcefully that those institutions which participate in it can expect in
future to enjoy âmost favoured statusâ with . . . [the Abu Dhabi SOE].â This email was sent
approximately two weeks before the GMRAC met to approve the Abu Dhabi BDC.

18. Deutsche Bank ultimately provided financing for the Yacht.

19. Deutsche Bank executed the BDC contract with the Abu Dhabi BDC on or
about June 3, 2010. Seven days after Deutsche Bank signed the BDC contract with the Abu Dhabi
BDC, Deutsche Bank received the business from the Abu Dhabi SOE for Project X.

20. On or about July 22, 2010, within weeks of receiving the business, Deutsche
Bank amended the Abu Dhabi BDCâs contract to increase the payment under the contract and to
include an ongoing monthly retainer of â¬85,000, without referencing any additional services that

the Abu Dhabi BDC would provide.
21. On or about July 26, 2010, Deutsche Bank corruptly paid the Abu Dhabi
BDC â¬1.585 million, comprised of a â¬1.5 million success fee for Project X and the first monthly
retainer, which it falsely recorded in Deutsche Bankâs books as a âconsultancy charge.â

22. Deutsche Bank did not conduct due diligence on the Abu Dhabi BDC before
executing the contract with the Abu Dhabi BDC and beginning to pay fees thereunder. Deutsche
Bank even failed to document the Abu Dhabi BDCâs full name and biographical information. In
total, Deutsche Bank corruptly paid the Abu Dhabi BDC approximately $3,464,650 without any
invoices and with minimal evidence of services provided, and caused those payments to be falsely
recorded in Deutsche Bank AGâs books, records, and accounts.

Falsification of Records and Failures to Implement Controls in Connection
with Corrupt Payments in Saudi Arabia

23. In or about 2011, Deutsche Bank AG entered into a BDC contract with a
special purpose vehicle (âSPVâ) beneficially owned by the wife of an individual who was
responsible for managing the family office and the personal investments (âthe Family Officeâ) of
a Saudi official (âthe Family Office Managerâ). The business was managed out of a European
Deutsche Bank subsidiary. Under the terms of the contract, the SPV owned by the Family Office
Managerâs wife (âthe Saudi BDCâ) would be paid fees that were falsely recorded in the Companyâs
books as âreferral fees,â when the true purpose was for Deutsche Bank to make corrupt payments
to the Family Office Manager in order for Deutsche Bank to retain the business of the Family
Office.

24. The Family Office Manager made investment decisions for the Family
Office and, during the Relevant FCPA Period, Deutsche Bank AG managed hundreds of millions

of dollars in investments for the Family Office. Deutsche Bank AG contracted with the Saudi
BDC to facilitate and conceal corrupt payments from Deutsche Bank AG to the Family Office
Manager, because Deutsche Bank bankers believed that the Family Office Manager would take
the Saudi officialâs business to another bank if it did not pay bribes to the Family Office Manager.

25. Prior to entering into a contractual relationship with the Saudi BDC, certain
Deutsche Bank AG bankers, including at least four Managing Directors of Deutsche Bank AG and
several high-level employees and officers of Deutsche Bank AG and Deutsche Bankâs European
subsidiary, knew that the Saudi BDC was the wife of the Family Office Manager and that the
purpose of engaging the Saudi BDC was to corruptly provide bribe payments to the Family Office
Manager in order to retain the business of the Family Office.

26. To facilitate corrupt payments to the Family Office Manager through the
Saudi BDC, Deutsche Bank helped the Saudi BDC establish a shell company in the British Virgin
Islands (âthe BVI Companyâ) and opened an account for the BVI Company at Deutsche Bank into
which Deutsche Bank AG made payments to the Saudi BDC.

27. On or about May 3, 2011, a Deutsche Bank Director, who was also the
regional head of sales and business management (âDeutsche Bank Director 1â), emailed Deutsche
Bank AG Managing Directors, including a high-level executive of Deutsche Bankâs European
subsidiary, seeking support and approval for the arrangement because â[the Saudi BDCâs]| husband
[was] a Director of the [] client,â creating an economic connection between the client and the âpaid
[Saudi BDC].â

28. To conceal the corrupt nature of the agreement with the Saudi BDC,
Deutsche Bank Director | falsely portrayed the Saudi BDC as the source of the business with the
Family Office in documentation provided to Deutsche Bank AG. Deutsche Bank Director | and
other Deutsche Bank employees knew that the Saudi BDC was not the source of the business,

9
because a Deutsche Bank AG Managing Director and regional business manager (âDeutsche Bank
AG Managing Director 2â) had a pre-existing relationship with the Family Office from his
previous employment at another bank, and he brought the Family Office client with him to
Deutsche Bank AG in or about 2010, months before he insisted that the Saudi BDC was the
âfinderâ and source of the business. Deutsche Bank bankers were aware that the Family Office
Manager and the Saudi BDC had received âfinderâs feesâ from this other bank, and that they would
expect the same from Deutsche Bank.

29. Because the Saudi BDC arrangement involved Deutsche Bank AG,
Deutsche Bankâs European subsidiary, and the establishment of a new client account at Deutsche
Bank for the BVI Company, multiple senior officers of Deutsche Bank considered and approved
the Saudi BDCâs consulting engagement. This approval chain for the Saudi BDC included a senior
executive of Deutsche Bankâs European subsidiary and a regional wealth management executive.
Each of these individuals approved the Saudi BDC relationship despite understanding the corrupt
purpose of the engagement. The Deutsche Bank European subsidiary senior executive cited âthe
high value of the clientâ as justification for paying the Saudi BDC.

30. Deutsche Bank AG made four payments to the Saudi BDC, which Deutsche
Bank AG deposited into the BVI Companyâs account held at Deutsche Bank. The first payment
was falsely described as an âexceptional paymentâ of $150,000 that was cleared through New
York, New York on or about December 22, 2011. The Saudi BDC was not entitled to this payment
under the terms of the BDC contract with Deutsche Bank AG. However, an email among Deutsche
Bank bankers, including Deutsche Bank Director 1, Deutsche Bank AG Managing Director 2, a
Deutsche Bank AG Managing Director and regional Private Wealth Management officer
(âDeutsche Bank AG Managing Director 3â), and another Deutsche Bank AG Managing Director

10
who was a regional Private Wealth Management officer (âDeutsche Bank AG Managing Director
4â), explained that this exceptional payment would âprovide [Deutsche Bank AG Managing
Director 2] with additional influence to persuade the client to upsell/invest existing large cash
balances.â In another email regarding this payment, Deutsche Bank AG Managing Director 2
stated that he needed to make the payment to âincentiviseâ the Family Office Manager, and further
urged approval of the âexceptionalâ payment, stating, âMoney paid to [the Family Office Manager]
will remain in an SPV opened for that purpose with us.â Deutsche Bank Managing Director 4
approved the âexceptional payment,â which was in fact a bribe to the Family Office Manager.

31. Deutsche Bank AG made two payments pursuant to the BDC contract with
the Saudi BDC: $220,738 in or about February 2012 and â¬340,000 in or about December 2012.
The February 2012 payment cleared through New York, New York, and passed through the
Eastern District of New York. These payments were falsely recorded as referral fees for the
introduction of a new clientâthe Family Officeâunder the contract. However, the Deutsche
Bank bankers, including Deutsche Bank AG Managing Director 2 and others, knew that the Saudi
BDC did not introduce the Family Office to Deutsche Bank AG, that the Family Office was not a
new client, and that the payments to the Saudi BDC were in fact bribes paid to the Family Office
Manager to retain the Family Office business.

32. Deutsche Bank AG also made a payment falsely recorded as a âgoodwill
paymentâ to the Saudi BDC that was not authorized by the BDC contract. In or about December
2012, in response to the Family Office Managerâs complaints about the amount of money he
personally was receiving under the Saudi BDCâs contract, Deutsche Bank AG made a second
exceptional payment to the Saudi BDC of â¬220,000. In an email advocating for this payment, sent
on or about November 30, 2012, Deutsche Bank Director 1 stated, â[Deutsche Bankâs] single

1]
largest relationship [in the region] . . . is at riskâ and there was the âserious potential of the client
withdrawing and closing his relationshipâ if the payment were not made. To appease the Family
Office Manager, and to retain the Family Officeâs business, Deutsche Bank AG made the corrupt
payment and falsely recorded it as a âgoodwill payment.â

33. After the âgoodwill payment,â Deutsche Bank Director 1 and other
Deutsche Bank bankers continued to push for additional payments to the Saudi BDC. For example,
Deutsche Bank Director 1 sent an email on or about August 30, 2013 cautioning that âclient and
[the Saudi BDC] are intimately linked and. . . any cessation of payment to the [the Saudi BDC]
will certainly prompt a significant outflow of assetsâ from the Family Office. The BDC contract
with the Saudi BDC was terminated in or about March 2016.

34. â Because Deutsche Bank helped set up the BVI Company and managed the
account into which payments were made by Deutsche Bank, Deutsche Bank was also aware that
payments to the BVI Company were ultimately transferred from that account to the Family Office
Manager, and employees and agents of Deutsche Bank AG knew that fees paid to the Saudi BDC
were bribes that were falsely recorded in Deutsche Bank AGâs books and records.

35. In addition to the four payments made to the Saudi BDC via the BVI
Company, Deutsche Bank also provided the Family Office Manager with additional benefits in
order to retain Family Office business, including a loan of approximately â¬635,000 to purchase a
house in France.

36. Between in or about 2011 and 2012, Deutsche Bank corruptly paid the Saudi
BDC a total of approximately $1,087,538 and caused those payments to be falsely recorded in the

Companyâs books, records and accounts.

12
Further Falsification of Records and Failures to Implement Controls

37. Between in or about February 2007 and February 2016, Deutsche Bank
maintained a BDC relationship with a regional tax judge (âthe Italian BDCâ) to bring clients to
Deutsche Bank.

38. Email communications and other documents exchanged between Deutsche
Bank employees around the time of the Italian BDCâs onboarding indicated clearly that the Italian
BDC was a tax judge.

39. Furthermore, invoices and records of payments to the Italian BDC
throughout his engagement were known by certain Deutsche Bank AG Managing Directors and
Deutsche Bank employees to be false, including because certain employees assisted in the
falsification of documents, and Deutsche Bank made payments to the Italian BDC outside of the
terms of his BDC contracts. For example:

a. Under the Italian BDCâs 2008 and later contracts, the Italian BDC
was to be paid twice a year by Deutsche Bank. But records show that he was in fact paid more
often than twice a year, received multiple payments for the same services, and sometimes received
payments for no services at all. The Italian BDC was also paid at a higher commission rate than
his contracts allowed;

b. When one of the Italian BDCâs 2010 invoices was challenged for
lack of supporting services, the Italian BDCâs business sponsor, who was a Deutsche Bank
Director (âDeutsche Bank Director 2â), falsely linked the introduction of three accounts for
Deutsche Bank clients to the Italian BDC;

C. In or about 2011, Deutsche Bank continued to pay the Italian BDC
for services, even though his contract had not been renewed for that year;

13
d. Between in or about 2012 and 2013, when the Italian BDC
demanded more money than he was entitled to under his contract, Deutsche Bank Director 2 and
other Deutsche Bank employees agreed that they would âfind another agreement/job to sign and
he can then invoice usâ for the amounts he requested for those services. Deutsche Bank Director
2 and other Deutsche Bank bankers ultimately agreed that the Italian BDC would submit some
training materials or an advisory report to justify the demanded payment. While the Italian BDC
provided some research materials to Deutsche Bank, email communications involving Deutsche
Bank Director 2, other Deutsche Bank employees, and the Italian BDC make it clear that this
payment was not for the materials submitted, but to comply with the Italian BDCâs demand for
more fees than he was entitled to under the BDC contract; and

e. In or about 2014, the Italian BDC demanded â¬75,000 for introducing
a client to a Deutsche Bank entity not covered by his BDC contract. A high-ranking officer of
Deutsche Bank, who was a Deutsche Bank AG Director, proposed justifying the payment by
linking it to another Deutsche Bank project unrelated to the Italian BDC. In response, the Italian
BDC suggested that he invoice Deutsche Bank for additional âreports.â Deutsche Bank ultimately
made a one-time payment of â¬75,000 to the Italian BDC to satisfy this demand, which was entirely
outside of the BDC agreement and was falsely recorded in Deutsche Bank AGâs books and records.

AO. On or about February 23, 2016, Deutsche Bank made a payment to the
Italian BDC of approximately $39,185 that was falsely recorded in Deutsche Bankâs books and
records.

Al. Deutsche Bank paid the Italian BDC a total of approximately $864,450

between in or about 2007 and 2016.

II. THE COMMODITIES FRAUD SCHEME
The Defendant and Other Relevant Individuals

42. From in or about and between 2008 and 2013 (the âRelevant Commodities

Market Overview and Definitions

48. A âfutures contractâ was a type of legally binding contract to buy or sell a
particular product or financial instrument at an agreed-upon price and on an agreed-upon date in
the future. When the parties to the futures contract (namely, the buyer and the seller) entered into
their agreement, the buyer agreed to pay for, and the seller agreed to provide, a particular product
or financial instrument at the agreed-upon price on the agreed-upon date in the future. Futures
contracts were traded on markets designated and regulated by the United States Commodity
Futures Trading Commission (âCFTCâ).

49, The CME Group Inc. (âCME Groupâ) was a commodities marketplace
made up of several exchanges, including the Commodity Exchange, Inc. (ââCOMEXââ) and the New
York Mercantile Exchange, Inc. (âNYMEXâ). Each of COMEX and NYMEX was a âregistered
entityâ with the CFTC.

50. âGlobexâ was an electronic trading system used by COMEX and NYMEX,
which allowed market participants to trade futures contracts from anywhere in the world. The
CME Group operated Globex using computer servers located in Chicago and Aurora, Illinois.

51. Precious metals futures contracts included gold, silver, platinum, and
palladium futures contracts, which were contracts for the delivery of gold, silver, platinum, and
palladium, respectively, in the future at an agreed-upon price. Gold and silver futures contracts
were traded on COMEX, and platinum and palladium futures contracts were traded on NYMEX,
both using the Globex system.

16
52. Traders using Globex could place orders in the form of âbidsâ to buy or
âoffersâ to sell one or more futures contracts at various prices, or âlevels.â

53. Trading on Globex was conducted electronically using a visible âorder
bookâ that displayed quantities of anonymous orders (i.e., offers to sell futures contracts and bids
to buy futures contracts).

54. An order was âfilledâ or âexecutedâ when a buyerâs bid price and a sellerâs
offer price for a particular contract matched.

55. An âicebergâ order was a type of order that traders could place when trading
precious metals futures contracts on COMEX and NYMEX. In an iceberg order, the total amount
of the order was divided into a visible portion of a certain pre-set quantity that was visible to other
market participants, and a portion of the order (i.e., the remainder of the order) that was not.
Whenever the visible portion of the order was filled, the same, pre-set quantity of the remaining,
hidden portion automatically became visible; this process repeated until the entire remainder of
the order was either executed or canceled.

The Conspiracy and Scheme to Defraud Precious Metals Market Participants

56. During the Relevant Commodities Fraud Period, Deutsche Bank AG,
through its employees and agents, including Vorley, Chanu, Liew, Bases, and Trader 1
(collectively, the âSubject Tradersâ), knowingly and willfully conspired and schemed to deceive
other precious metals market participants by creating and communicating materially false and
misleading information regarding supply or demand, in order to induce such other market
participants into trading precious metals futures contracts at prices, quantities, and times that they
would not have otherwise, in order to make money and avoid losses for the Company and the
Subject Traders.

17
57. In furtherance of the conspiracy, on many occasions during the Relevant
Commodities Fraud Period, the Subject Traders placed one or more visible orders for precious
metals futures contracts on one side of the market that, at the time they placed the orders, they
intended to cancel before execution (the âFraudulent Ordersâ) in order to deceive other traders.

58. By placing the Fraudulent Orders, the Subject Traders intended to create
and communicate false and misleading information regarding supply or demand (i.e., orders they
did not intend to execute) in order to deceive other traders.

59. It was further part of the conspiracy that this false and misleading
information caused other traders to buy or to sell futures contracts at prices, quantities, and times
that they otherwise would not have because, among other things, such traders reacted to the false
and misleading increase in supply or demand.

60. The Subject Traders placed Fraudulent Orders to buy, which created the
false and misleading impression in the market of increased demand, which was intended to
manipulate and move commodity futures prices upward.

6l. In addition, the Subject Traders placed Fraudulent Orders to sell, which
created the false and misleading impression in the market of increased supply, which was intended
to manipulate and move commodity futures prices downward.

62. The Subject Traders placed orders at a lower visible quantity, often in the
form of iceberg orders, on the opposite side of the market, that they intended to execute (the
âPrimary Ordersâ).

63. The Subject Traders placed Fraudulent Orders with the intent to artificially
manipulate and move the prevailing price in a manner that would increase the likelihood that one
or more of their Primary Orders would be filled.

18
64. The Fraudulent Orders placed by the Subject Traders were material
misrepresentations that falsely and fraudulently represented to traders that the Subject Traders
were intending to trade the Fraudulent Orders when, in fact, they were not because, at the time the
Fraudulent Orders were placed, the Subject Traders intended to cancel them before execution.

65. The Subject Traders engaged in this false, misleading, and deceptive
practice both by themselves and in coordination with each other and with other traders employed
at Deutsche Bank AG, all in furtherance of the conspiracy. When placing Fraudulent Orders by
themselves, the Subject Traders would place their Fraudulent Orders individually in order to
facilitate the execution of their own Primary Orders, without the placement of a Fraudulent Order
by another trader. By contrast, coordinated placement of the Fraudulent Orders involved one or
more additional traders. When engaging in coordinated placement of Fraudulent Orders, one of
the Subject Traders, or another trader at Deutsche Bank AG, would place one or more Fraudulent
Orders on one side of the market in order to facilitate the execution of Primary Orders placed on
the opposite side of the market by another of the Subject Traders, or another trader at Deutsche
Bank AG.

66. The Subject Traders intended to, attempted to, and often did cancel the
Fraudulent Orders before any part of the Fraudulent Orders were executed.

67. The Fraudulent Orders placed by the Subject Traders exposed Deutsche
Bank AG to (i) new and increased risks of loss, including in the form of: (a) fees, costs, and
expenses incurred through investigations, litigation, and proceedings arising from the underlying
conduct; (b) losses associated with the financial risk that the Fraudulent Orders would be executed
(despite the tradersâ intent to cancel the Fraudulent Orders before execution); and (c) reputational
harm; and (ii) actual loss, including: (a) the payment by Deutsche Bank AG of a $30,000,000 civil

19
monetary penalty to the CFTC on or around January 29, 2018, and (b) fees, costs, and expenses
actually incurred through investigations, litigation, and proceedings arising from the underlying
conduct.

68. In submitting the Fraudulent Orders and Primary Orders in furtherance of
their scheme, the Subject Traders transmitted and caused to be transmitted, wire communications
from outside the United States into and through United States, as well as interstate wire
communications, including certain wire communications that passed through the Eastern District

of New York.

CORPORATE COMPLIANCE PROGRAM

In order to address any deficiencies in its internal controls, compliance code, policies, and
procedures regarding compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (ââFCPAâ), 15 U.S.C. Â§Â§
78dd-1, et seg., and other applicable anti-corruption laws, Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft (the
âCompanyââ), on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries and affiliates, agrees to continue to conduct,
in a manner consistent with all of its obligations under this Agreement, appropriate reviews of its
existing internal controls, policies, and procedures.

Where necessary and appropriate, the Company agrees to adopt new, or to modify its
existing compliance programs, including internal controls, compliance policies, and procedures in
order to ensure that 1t maintains: (a) an effective system of internal accounting controls designed
to ensure the making and keeping of fair and accurate books, records, and accounts; and (b) a
rigorous anti-corruption compliance program that incorporates relevant internal accounting
controls, as well as policies and procedures designed to effectively detect and deter violations of
the FCPA and other applicable anti-corruption laws. At a minimum, this should include, but not
be limited to, the following elements to the extent they are not already part of the Companyâs
existing internal controls, compliance code, policies, and procedures:

Commitment to Compliance

by them. The Company will create and foster a culture of ethics and compliance with the law in
its day-to-day operations at all levels of the company.
Policies and Procedures

2. The Company will develop and promulgate a clearly articulated and visible
corporate policy against violations of the FCPA and other applicable foreign law counterparts
(collectively, the âanti-corruption lawsâ), which policy shall be memorialized in a written
compliance code or codes.

3. The Company will develop and promulgate compliance policies and procedures
designed to reduce the prospect of violations of the anti-corruption laws and the Companyâs
compliance code, and the Company will take appropriate measures to encourage and support the

corruption laws by personnel at all levels of the Company. These anti-corruption policies and
procedures shall apply to all directors, officers, and employees and, where necessary and
appropriate, outside parties acting on behalf of the Company in a foreign jurisdiction, including,
but not limited to, agents and intermediaries, consultants, representatives, distributors, teaming
partners, contractors and suppliers, consortia, and joint venture partners (collectively, âagents and

f. facilitation payments; and
g. solicitation and extortion.

specific authorization;

b. transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles or any other criteria
applicable to such statements, and to maintain accountability for assets;

or specific authorization; and

d. the recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets
at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences.

of a periodic risk assessment addressing the individual circumstances of the Company, in particular
the foreign bribery risks facing the Company, including, but not limited to, its geographical

organization, interactions with various types and levels of government officials, industrial sectors
of operation, potential clients and business partners, use of third parties, gifts, travel and
entertainment expenses, charitable and political donations, involvement in joint venture
arrangements, importance of licenses and permits in the Companyâs operations, degree of
governmental oversight and inspection, and volume and importance of goods and personnel
clearing through customs and immigration.

6. The Company shall review its anti-corruption compliance policies and procedures
no less than annually and update them as appropriate to ensure their continued effectiveness, taking
into account relevant developments in the field and evolving international and industry standards.

of the Company for the implementation and oversight of the Companyâs anti-corruption
compliance code, policies, and procedures. Such corporate official(s) shall have the authority to
report directly to independent monitoring bodies, including internal audit, the Companyâs
Management Board, or any appropriate committee of the Management Board, and shall have an
adequate level of stature and autonomy from management as well as sufficient resources and
authority to maintain such autonomy.

Training and Guidance

8. The Company will implement mechanisms designed to ensure that its anti-
corruption compliance code, policies, and procedures are effectively communicated to all
directors, officers, employees, and, where necessary and appropriate, agents and business partners.
These mechanisms shall include: (a) periodic training for all directors and officers, all employees

in positions of leadership or trust, positions that require such training (e.g., internal audit, sales,
legal, compliance, finance), or positions that otherwise pose a corruption risk to the Company,
and, where necessary and appropriate, agents and business partners; and (b) corresponding
certifications by all such directors, officers, employees, agents, and business partners, certifying
compliance with the training requirements. The Company will conduct training in a manner
tailored to the audienceâs size, sophistication, or subject matter expertise and, where appropriate,
will discuss prior compliance incidents.

9, The Company will maintain, or where necessary establish, an effective system for
providing guidance and advice to directors, officers, employees, and, where necessary and
appropriate, agents and business partners, on complying with the Companyâs anti-corruption
compliance code, policies, and procedures, including when they need advice on an urgent basis or
in any foreign jurisdiction in which the Company operates.

Internal Reporting and Investigation

10. = The Company will maintain, or where necessary establish, an effective system for
internal and, where possible, confidential reporting by, and protection of, directors, officers,
employees, and, where appropriate, agents and business partners concerning violations of the anti-
corruption laws or the Companyâs anti-corruption compliance code, policies, and procedures.

11. = The Company will maintain, or where necessary establish, an effective and reliable
process with sufficient resources for responding to, investigating, and documenting allegations of
violations of the anti-corruption laws or the Companyâs anti-corruption compliance code, policies,
and procedures. The Company will handle the investigations of such complaints in an effective
manner, including routing the complaints to proper personnel, conducting timely and thorough

investigations, and imposing appropriate discipline.
Enforcement and Discipline

12. The Company will implement mechanisms designed to effectively enforce its
compliance code, policies, and procedures, including appropriately incentivizing compliance and
disciplining violations.

13. The Company will institute appropriate disciplinary procedures to address, among
other things, violations of the anti-corruption laws and the Companyâs anti-corruption compliance
code, policies, and procedures by the Companyâs directors, officers, and employees. Such
procedures should be applied consistently, fairly and in a manner commensurate with the violation,
regardless of the position held by, or perceived importance of, the director, officer, or employee.
The Company shall implement procedures to ensure that where misconduct is discovered,
reasonable steps are taken to remedy the harm resulting from such misconduct, and to ensure that
appropriate steps are taken to prevent further similar misconduct, including assessing the internal
controls, compliance code, policies, and procedures and making modifications necessary to ensure
the overall anti-corruption compliance program is effective.

Third-Party Relationships

14. The Company will institute appropriate risk-based due diligence and compliance
requirements pertaining to the retention and oversight of all agents and business partners,
including:

a. properly documented due diligence pertaining to the hiring and appropriate

and regular oversight of agents and business partners;
b. informing agents and business partners of the Companyâs commitment to
abiding by anti-corruption laws, and of the Companyâs anti-corruption compliance code, policies,
and procedures; and

C. seeking a reciprocal commitment from agents and business partners. The
Company will understand and record the business rationale for using a third party in a transaction,
and will conduct adequate due diligence with respect to the risks posed by a third-party partner
such as a third-party partnerâs reputations and relationships, if any, with foreign officials. The
Company will ensure that contract terms with third parties specifically describe the services to be
performed, that the third party is actually performing the described work, and that its compensation
is commensurate with the work being provided in that industry and geographical region. The
Company will engage in ongoing monitoring of third-party relationships through updated due
diligence, training, audits, and/or annual compliance certifications by the third party.

15. Where necessary and appropriate, the Company will include standard provisions
in agreements, contracts, and renewals thereof with all agents and business partners that are
reasonably calculated to prevent violations of the anti-corruption laws, which may, depending
upon the circumstances, include: (a) anti-corruption representations and undertakings relating to
compliance with the anti-corruption laws; (b) rights to conduct audits of the books, records, and
accounts of the agent or business partner to ensure compliance with the foregoing; and (c) rights
to terminate an agent or business partner as a result of any breach of the anti-corruption laws, the
Companyâs compliance code, policies, or procedures, or the representations and undertakings

related to such matters.
Mergers and Acquisitions

16. The Company will develop and implement policies and procedures for mergers
and acquisitions requiring that the Company conduct appropriate risk-based due diligence on
potential new business entities, including appropriate FCPA and anti-corruption due diligence by
legal, accounting, and compliance personnel.

17. The Company will ensure that the Companyâs compliance code, policies, and
procedures regarding the anti-corruption laws apply as quickly as is practicable to newly acquired
businesses or entities merged with the Company and will promptly:

a. train the directors, officers, employees, agents, and business partners
consistent with Paragraphs 18 and 19 above on the anti-corruption laws and the Companyâs
compliance code, policies, and procedures regarding anti-corruption laws; and

b. where warranted, conduct an FCPA-specific audit of all newly acquired or
merged businesses as quickly as practicable.

Monitoring, Testing, and Remediation

18. In order to ensure that its compliance program does not become stale, the Company
will conduct periodic reviews and testing of its anti-corruption compliance codes, policies, and
procedures designed to evaluate and improve their effectiveness in preventing and detecting
violations of anti-corruption laws and the Companyâs anti-corruption codes, policies, and
procedures, taking into account relevant developments in the field and evolving international and
industry standards. The Company will ensure that compliance and control personnel have
sufficient direct or indirect access to relevant sources of data to allow for timely and effective

monitoring and/or testing of transactions. Based on such review and testing and its analysis of any
prior misconduct, when misconduct is identified, the Company will conduct a thoughtful root

cause analysis and timely and appropriately remediate to address the root causes.
ATTACHMENT D
REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft (the âCompanyââ) agrees that it will report to the Offices
periodically, at no less than twelve-month intervals during a three-year term, regarding
remediation and implementation of the compliance program and internal controls, policies, and
procedures described in Attachment C. During this three-year period, the Company shall: (1)
conduct an initial review and submit a report, and (2) conduct and prepare at least two (2) follow-
up reviews and reports, as described below:

a. By no later than one year from the date this Agreement is executed, the
Company shall complete an initial review and submit to the Offices a written report setting forth
a complete description of its remediation efforts to date, its proposals reasonably designed to
improve the Companyâs internal controls, policies, and procedures for ensuring compliance with
the FCPA and other applicable anti-corruption laws, and the proposed scope of the subsequent
reviews (the âfirst reportâ).

b. The Company shall undertake at least two follow-up reviews, incorporating
the Officesâ views on the Companyâs prior reviews and reports, to further monitor and assess
whether the Companyâs policies and procedures are reasonably designed to detect and prevent
violations of the FCPA and other applicable anti-corruption laws.

C. The initial review and the first report shall be submitted by no later than one
year after this Agreement is executed. The first follow-up review shall be completed and the

second report shall be submitted to the Offices by no later than one year after the submission of

submitted to the Offices by no later than thirty days before the end of the Term.

d. The reports will likely include proprietary, financial, confidential, and
competitive business information. Moreover, public disclosure of the reports could discourage
cooperation, impede pending or potential government investigations and thus undermine the
objectives of the reporting requirement. For these reasons, among others, the reports and the
contents thereof are intended to remain and shall remain non-public, except as otherwise agreed to
by the parties in writing, or except to the extent that the Offices determine in their sole discretion
that disclosure would be in furtherance of the Officesâ discharge of their duties and responsibilities
or is otherwise required by law.

e. The reports shall be transmitted to Chief - FCPA Unit, Fraud Section,
Criminal Division, U.S. Department of Justice, 1400 New York Avenue NW, Washington, DC
20530; Chief â Bank Integrity Unit, Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, Criminal

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Friday, January 8, 2021

Deutsche Bank Agrees to Pay over $130 Million to Resolve Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and
Fraud Case

Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft (Deutsche Bank or the Company) has agreed to pay more than $130 million to resolve the governmentâs
investigation into violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and a separate investigation into a commodities fraud scheme.

The resolution includes criminal penalties of $85,186,206, criminal disgorgement of $681,480, victim Compensation payments of $1,223,738,
and $43,329,622 to be paid to the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission in a coordinated resolution.

Deutsche Bank is a multi-national financial services company headquartered in Frankfurt, Germany. The charges arise out of a scheme to
conceal corrupt payments and bribes made to third-party intermediaries by falsely recording them on Deutsche Bankâs books and records, as
well as related internal accounting control violations, and a separate scheme to engage in fraudulent and manipulative commodities trading
practices involving publicly-traded precious metals futures contracts.

Deutsche Bank entered into a three-year deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Money
Laundering and Asset Recovery Section (MLARS) and with the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Eastern District of New York. The criminal
information was filed today in the Eastern District of New York charging Deutsche Bank with one count of conspiracy to violate the books and
records and internal accounting controls provisions of the FCPA and one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud affecting a financial institution
in relation to the commodities conduct.

âDeutsche Bank engaged in a seven-year course of conduct, during which it failed to implement a system of internal accounting controls
regarding the use of company funds and falsified its books and records to conceal corrupt and improper payments,â said Acting Deputy
Assistant Attorney General Robert Zink of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division. âSeparately, Deutsche Bank traders on three continents
sought to manipulate our public financial markets through fraud for five years. This resolution exemplifies the departmentâs commitment to help
ensure that publicly traded companies devise and implement appropriate and proper systems of internal accounting controls and maintain
accurate and truthful corporate documentation. It also stands as an example of the departmentâs efforts to police the public U.S. markets so
that all may continue to trust, and rely upon, the integrity of our public financial systems.â

âDeutsche Bank engaged in a criminal scheme to conceal payments to so-called consultants worldwide who served as conduits for bribes to
foreign officials and others so that they could unfairly obtain and retain lucrative business projects,â stated Acting U.S. Attorney Seth D.
DuCharme of the Eastern District of New York. âThis office will continue to hold responsible financial institutions that operate in the United
States and engage in practices to facilitate criminal activity in order to increase their bottom line.â

âThe U.S. Postal Inspection Service takes pride in investigating complex fraud and corruption cases that impact American investors,â said
Inspector in Charge Delany De LÃ©on-Coldn of the U.S. Postal Inspection Serviceâs Criminal Investigations Group. âThis type of deceptive activity
can cause immeasurable economic losses to competitive markets around the world. The combined efforts of our partners at the FBI and
Department of Justice helped to bring todayâs significant action which illustrates our efforts to protect the United States and the international
marketplace.â

The FCPA Case

According to admissions and court documents, between 2009 and 2016, Deutsche Bank, acting through its employees and agents, including
managing directors and high-level regional executives, knowingly and willfully conspired to maintain false books, records, and accounts to
conceal, among other things, payments to a business development consultant (BDC) who was acting as a proxy for a foreign official and
payments to a BDC that were actually bribes paid to a decisionmaker for a client in order to obtain lucrative business for the bank. In some
instances, Deutsche Bank made payments to BDCs that were not supported by invoices or evidence of any services provided. In other cases,
Deutsche Bank employees created or helped BDCâs create false justifications for payments.

In relation to a Saudi BDC, Deutsche Bank admitted that its employees conspired to contract with a company owned by the wife of a client
decisionmaker to facilitate bribe payments of over $1 million to the decisionmaker. Deutsche Bank approved the BDC relationship despite
Deutsche Bank employees knowing about the relationship between the Saudi BDC and the decisionmaker, and approved the corrupt payments
despite Deutsche Bank employees openly discussing the need to pay the Saudi BDC in order to incentivize her husband to continue to do
business with Deutsche Bank. In requesting approval of one payment, Deutsche Bank employees cautioned that the âclient and [the Saudi BDC]
are intimately linked and... . any cessation of payment to the [the Saudi BDC] will certainly prompt a significant outflow of [business]â from the
client.

Deutsche Bank also contracted with an Abu Dhabi BDC to obtain a lucrative transaction, despite Deutsche Bank employees knowing that the
Abu Dhabi BDC lacked qualifications as a BDC, other than his family relationship with the client decisionmaker, and that the Abu Dhabi BDC was
in fact acting as proxy for the client decisionmaker. Deutsche Bank paid the Abu Dhabi BDC over $3 million without invoices.

By agreeing to misrepresent the purpose of payments to BDCs and falsely characterizing payments to others as payments to BDCs, Deutsche
Bank employees conspired to falsify Deutsche Bankâs books, records, and accounts, in violation of the FCPA. Additionally, Deutsche Bank
employees knowingly and willfully conspired to fail to implement internal accounting controls in violation of the FCPA by, among other things,
failing to conduct meaningful due diligence regarding BDCs, making payments to certain BDCs who were not under contract with Deutsche
Bank at the time, and making payments to certain BDCs without invoices or adequate documentation of the services purportedly performed.

Deutsche Bank will pay a total criminal penalty of $79,561,206 in relation to the FCPA scheme. In a related matter with the U.S. Securities &
Exchange Commission, Deutsche Bank will also pay $43,329,622 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest.

The Commodities Fraud Case

According to admissions and court documents, between 2008 and 2013, Deutsche Bank precious metals traders engaged in a scheme to
defraud other traders on the New York Mercantile Exchange Inc. and Commodity Exchange Inc., which are commodities exchanges operated by
the CME Group Inc. On numerous occasions, traders on Deutsche Bankâs precious metals desk in New York, Singapore, and London placed
orders to buy and sell precious metals futures contracts with the intent to cancel those orders before execution, including in an attempt to profit
by deceiving other market participants through injecting false and misleading information concerning the existence of genuine supply and
demand for precious metals futures contracts.

On Sept. 25, 2020, a Chicago federal jury found two former Deutsche Bank precious metals traders, James Vorley, 42, of the United Kingdom,
and Cedric Chanu, 40, of France and the United Arab Emirates, guilty of wire fraud affecting a financial institution for their respective roles in
the commodities scheme. A third former Deutsche Bank trader, David Liew, 35, of Singapore, pleaded guilty on June 1, 2017, to conspiracy to
commit wire fraud affecting a financial institution and spoofing. A fourth former Deutsche Bank trader, Edward Bases, 58, of New Canaan,
Connecticut, was charged in a third superseding indictment on Nov. 12, 2020, and awaits trial on fraud and conspiracy charges. An indictment is
merely an allegation and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.

Deutsche Bank has agreed to pay a total criminal amount of $7,530,218 in relation to the commodities scheme. This amount includes criminal
disgorgement of $681,480, victim compensation payments of $1,223,738, and a criminal penalty of $5,625,000, which will be fully credited
against Deutsche Bankâs payment of a civil monetary penalty of $30 million to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission in January 2018
in connection with substantially the same commodities conduct.

The department reached this resolution with Deutsche Bank based on a number of factors, including the Companyâs failure to voluntarily
disclose the conduct to the department and the nature and seriousness of the offense, which included corrupt payments, willful violations of the
FCPA accounting provisions, and commodities trading violations in three countries. Deutsche Bank received full credit for its cooperation with
the department's investigations and for its significant remediation. Penalties associated with both the FCPA and wire fraud conspiracies reflect a
discount of 25 percent off the middle of the otherwise-applicable U.S. Sentencing Guidelines fine range, to account for Deutsche Bankâs 2015
resolution in connection with its manipulation of the London Interbank Offered Rate.

The FCPA investigation is being conducted by the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, and is being prosecuted by the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud
Section and Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, and the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Eastern District of New York. Trial Attorneys
Katherine Nielsen, Elizabeth S. Boison and Nikhila Raj, and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Alixandra Smith and Whitman Knapp. The Justice
Departmentâs Office of International Affairs provided assistance in this case.

The commodities case is being investigated by the FBIâs New York Field Office, and is being prosecuted by the Fraud Section. Deputy Chief Brian
R. Young, Assistant Chief Avi Perry, and Trial Attorney Leslie S. Garthwaite of the Fraud Section are prosecuting the case.

The Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice Departmentâs FCPA
enforcement efforts can be found at www.justice.gov/criminal-fraud/foreign-corrupt-practices-act.

MLARS'âs Bank Integrity Unit investigates and prosecutes banks and other financial institutions, including their officers, managers, and
employees, whose actions threaten the integrity of the individual institution or the wider financial system.

At all times relevant to this indictment, unless otherwise specified:

Introduction

1. Defendant DMITRIJ HARDER was a Russian national, naturalized German

citizen and permanent resident alien of the United States. Defendant HARDER was the
Case 2:15-cr-00001-PD Document1 Filed 01/06/15 Page 2 of 23

president and owner of both the Chestnut Consulting Group, Inc. (âChestnut Inc.â), which was
incorporated in the State of Pennsylvania, and the Chestnut Consulting Group, Co., which was
incorporated in the State of Delaware. Defendant HARDER operated through one or both of
these entities (generally referred to herein as the âChestnut Groupâ) purportedly to provide,
among other things, consulting services to companies seeking financing from multilateral
development banks. The Chestnut Group was located in Southampton, in the Eastern District of
Pennsylvania. Because both Chestnut Inc. and Chestnut Consulting Group, Co. had their
principal place of business in the United States and were organized under the laws of
Pennsylvania and Delaware, each was a âdomestic concern,â as that term is used in the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act (ââFCPAâ), Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2(h)(1)(A). Because
defendant HARDER was a resident of the United States, defendant HARDER was a âdomestic
concern,â and an officer, director, employee and agent of a âdomestic concern,â as that term is
used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2(h)()(A).

2. Between in or around 2007 through in or around 2009, defendant HARDER
engaged in a scheme to pay approximately $3.5 million in bribe payments for the benefit of a
foreign official to corruptly influence the foreign officialâs actions on applications for financing
submitted to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (âEBRDââ) by the clients
of defendant HARDER and the Chestnut Group, and to corruptly influence the foreign official to
direct business to defendant HARDER and the Chestnut Group, and others.

Additional Relevant Entities and Individuals

3. The EBRD was a multilateral development bank headquartered in London,

England, and was owned by over 60 sovereign nations. Among other things, the EBRD provided

debt and equity financing for development projects in emerging economies, primarily in Eastern
Europe. On or about June 18, 1991, the President of the United States signed Executive Order
12766 designating the EBRD as a âpublic international organization.ââ The EBRD was thus a
âpublic international organization,â as that term is defined in the FCPA, Title 15, United States
Code, Section 78dd-2(h)(2).

4. âEBRD Officialâ was a Russian and United Kingdom national residing in or
around London, England, and was a senior banker working in the Natural Resources Group at
the EBRD. As a senior banker, EBRD Official served as an Operations Leader in the Natural
Resources Group and was responsible for leading the review of applications submitted to the
EBRD for project financing, including loans and equity investments. EBRD Official thus had
the authority to influence the process for approving project financing, and setting the terms and
conditions for that financing. EBRD Official was a âforeign official,â as that term is used in the
FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2(h)(2). Defendant DMITRIJ HARDER
knew EBRD Official from business associations dating back to at least 1999.

5. âEBRD Officialâs Sisterâ was a Russian and United Kingdom national residing in
or around London, England, and was the sister of EBRD Official. EBRD Officialâs Sister
purportedly provided consulting and other business services for the Chestnut Group. In reality,
however, EBRD Officialâs Sister provided no such services to the Chestnut Group or defendant
HARDER.

6. âCompany Aâ was a Russian independent oil and gas company established in
2000. Company A had oil and gas operations in the Russian Federation. Company A retained

Chestnut Inc. purportedly to provide consulting and other services.
Case 2:15-cr-00001-PD Document1 Filed 01/06/15 Page 4 of 23

7. âCompany Bâ was an oil and gas company established in 2006 and incorporated
in the United Kingdom. Company B had oil and gas operations in the Russian Federation.
Company B retained Chestnut Inc. purportedly to provide consulting and other services.

The Bribery Scheme

8. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, Title 15, United States
Code, Sections 78dd-1, et seq. (âFCPAââ), prohibited certain classes of persons and entities from
corruptly making payments to foreign officials to assist in obtaining or retaining business.
Specifically, the FCPA prohibited certain corporations and individuals from willfully making use
of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce corruptly in furtherance of an offer,
payment, promise to pay, or authorization of the payment of money or anything of value to any
person, while knowing that all or a portion of such money or thing of value would be offered,
given, or promised, directly or indirectly, to a foreign official to influence the foreign official in
his or her official capacity, induce the foreign official to do or omit to do an act in violation of
his or her lawful duty, or to secure any improper advantage in order to assist in obtaining or
retaining business for or with, or directing business to, any person.

9. The Travel Act, Title 18, United States Code, Section 1952, was enacted by
Congress for the purpose of, among other things, making it unlawful for persons and businesses
to travel in interstate or foreign commerce or use the mail or any facility in interstate commerce
to promote, manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate the promotion, management, establishment
or carrying on of certain unlawful activity, including violations of state anti-bribery laws.

10. Between in or about 2007 and in or about 2009, defendant DMITRIJ HARDER,
through the Chestnut Group, worked as a financial consultant to companies seeking project

financing from the EBRD. For at least four of these applications, including those of Company A
Case 2:15-cr-00001-PD Document1 Filed 01/06/15 Page 5 of 23

and Company B, EBRD Official was the Operations Leader responsible for leading the
management of the application process and negotiating the terms and conditions of any financing
provided by the EBRD. Chestnut Inc. was retained by Company A and Company B despite its
relatively small size, distant location from the EBRD, and unproven track record as a financial
advisor. As set forth below, the EBRD ultimately approved the applications for project financing
for Company A and Company B.

Company Aâs Application for Financing to the EBRD

 

11. In or about August 2007, Company A approached defendant DMITRIJ HARDER
and the Chestnut Group to assist it in raising financing for a natural gas development project in
Russia.

12. In or about September 2007, defendant DMITRIJ HARDER sent EBRD Official
an email about obtaining project financing from the EBRD for Company A in connection with
the project in Russia referenced in paragraph 11 above.

13. In or about October 2007, Chestnut Inc. entered into a financial services
agreement with Company A, which was signed by defendant DMITRIJ HARDER, whereby
Company A agreed to pay Chestnut Inc. a âsuccess feeâ of a certain percentage of the funds
obtained by Company A from the EBRD. On or about December 24, 2007, the financial
services agreement was amended by a supplemental financial services agreement, which
defendant HARDER also signed on behalf of Chestnut Inc.

14. On or about April 29, 2008, based upon the recommendation of EBRD Official as
the Operations Leader for Company Aâs application, the EBRD approved an $85 million equity

investment in Company A.
Case 2:15-cr-00001-PD Document1 Filed 01/06/15 Page 6 of 23

15. On or about May 13, 2008, Chestnut Inc. entered into a new financial services
agreement with a holding company for Company A (the âHolding Companyââ) created for the
specific purpose of receiving the EBRD funding. This agreement was almost identical to the
supplemental agreement between Chestnut Inc. and Company A, except that the agreement
provided that Chestnut Inc. would assist the Holding Company, rather than Company A, to raise
financing. This agreement was also signed on behalf of Chestnut Inc. by defendant DMITRIJ
HARDER.

16. On or about June 4, 2008, the $85 million equity investment was disbursed by
EBRD to the Holding Company, on behalf of Company A.

17. On or about June 25, 2008, as a result of the approval of Company Aâs
application to the EBRD for financing, the Holding Company paid Chestnut Inc. a âsuccess feeâ
amounting to approximately $1.7 million.

18. On or about the following dates, after receiving the success fees from Company A
and the Holding Company, defendant DMITRIJ HARDER caused wire transfer payments to be
made in approximately the following amounts from Chestnut Inc.âs bank account at
Commerzbank in Frankfurt, Germany, to the Citibank bank account in Jersey, Channel Islands,

belonging to EBRD Officialâs Sister:

 

Approximate Date Approximate Amount
July 11, 2008 $300,000
September 16, 2008 $199,637
October 13, 2008 $253,665

19. On or about March 10, 2009, the EBRD approved additional project financing for

Company A, in the form of a senior loan totaling 90 million Euros.
20. On or about April 10, 2009, Chestnut Inc. and Company A entered into a further
supplemental financial services agreement, which rescinded the earlier success fee, and made the
new success fee payable on the original equity investment of $85 million and new senior loan of
90 million Euros. This supplemental financial services agreement was signed on behalf of
Chestnut Inc. by defendant DMITRIJ HARDER.

21. On or about June 18, 2009, Company A paid Chestnut Inc. a new success fee of
approximately $2.9 million, based upon both the equity investment and senior loan from the
EBRD to Company A.

22. On or about July 16, 2009, defendant DMITRIJ HARDER caused the wire
transfer of approximately $310,121 from Chestnut Inc.âs bank account at 3rd Federal Bank in
Feasterville, Pennsylvania to the Citibank bank account in Jersey, Channel Islands, belonging to
EBRD Officialâs Sister.

23. In all, Chestnut Inc. received payments from Company A totaling approximately
$2.9 million, and defendant DMITRIJ HARDER caused payments to be made to EBRD
Officialâs Sister totaling approximately $1.06 million. While EBRD Officialâs Sister purportedly
received these payments as a result of providing consulting and other business services to the
Chestnut Group, in reality, EBRD Officialâs Sister provided no such services. Instead, EBRD
Officialâs Sister received these payments for the benefit of EBRD Official, to corruptly influence
the foreign officialâs actions on applications for financing by the clients of defendant HARDER
and the Chestnut Group, and to corruptly influence the foreign official to direct business to

defendant HARDER and the Chestnut Group.
Case 2:15-cr-00001-PD Document1 Filed 01/06/15 Page 8 of 23

Company Bâs Application for Financing to the EBRD

 

24. In or about 2007, Company B initially approached the EBRD about obtaining
financing for a gas development project. Although it appeared that the EBRD would approve
Company Bâs application for financing, Company B ultimately declined to obtain financing from
the EBRD and instead obtained its financing from another international bank. Company B did
not use the services of a financial consultant in connection with its initial application to the
EBRD.

25. On or about May 7, 2009, Company B approached the EBRD again about
obtaining additional financing. EBRD Official and others from the EBRD met with
representatives from Company B to discuss Company Bâs interest in obtaining such financing.
EBRD Official was thereafter assigned as Operations Leader for Company Bâs application for
financing with the EBRD.

26. On or about May 19, 2009, Chestnut Inc. and Company B entered into a financial
services agreement, whereby Company B agreed to pay Chestnut Inc. a âsuccess feeâ of a certain
percentage of the funds obtained by Company B. The financial services agreement was signed
on behalf of Chestnut Inc. by defendant DMITRIJ HARDER.

27. On or about July 29, 2009, based upon the recommendation of EBRD Official as
the Operations Leader for Company Bâs application, the EBRD approved Company Bâs
application for financing consisting of a $40 million equity investment and a $60 million
convertible loan.

28. On or about October 1, 2009, Company B paid Chestnut Inc. a success fee of

approximately $4.9 million. Because on or about July 27, 2009, Company B had previously paid
Case 2:15-cr-00001-PD Document1 Filed 01/06/15 Page 9 of 23

Chestnut Inc. an initial payment of approximately $100,000 to be credited to any success fees,
the total success fee paid by Company B to Chestnut Inc. was approximately $5 million.

29. On or about November 20, 2009, after Chestnut Inc. received the success fees
from Company B, defendant DMITRIJ HARDER caused a payment of approximately
$2,478,580.89 to be made to EBRD Offficialâs Sister. Although EBRD Officialâs Sister
purportedly received these payments as a result of providing consulting and other business
services to the Chestnut Group, in reality, EBRD Officialâs Sister provided no such services.
Instead, EBRD Officialâs Sister received these payments for the benefit of EBRD Official, to
corruptly influence the foreign officialâs actions on applications for financing by the clients of
defendant HARDER and the Chestnut Group, and to corruptly influence the foreign official to
direct business to defendant HARDER and the Chestnut Group.

The Concealment of the Bribe Payments

 

30. Through the Chestnut Group, defendant DMITRIJ HARDER paid EBRD
Officialâs Sister approximately $3.5 million in bribe payments for the benefit of EBRD Official.

31. To conceal and cover up these bribe payments, defendant DMITRIJ HARDER
and EBRD Officialâs Sister created false paperwork to make it appear that EBRD Officialâs
Sister had provided services to the Chestnut Group for these payments, when in fact no such
services were provided. The false documents included the following:

a. an invoice dated May 20, 2009 from EBRD Officialâs Sister to the
Chestnut Group requesting payment of $310,141.04 for being a

â[p|roducing agent - various projects;â
Case 2:15-cr-00001-PD Document1 Filed 01/06/15 Page 10 of 23

b. a âConfirmation of Servicesâ letter, dated October 9, 2009, from
Chestnut Inc. to EBRD Officialâs Sister setting forth a âpre-agreed co-
brokerage feeâ in the amount of âup to $2.6 million;â and
c. an invoice dated November 18, 2009 from EBRD Officialâs Sister to
the Chestnut Group requesting payment of approximately
$2,478,580.89 for being a â[p]roducing agent - various projects.â
The Conspiracy Charge
32. From in or around 2007 through in or around November 2009, in the Eastern
District of Pennsylvania and elsewhere, defendant
DMITRIJ HARDER
did knowingly and willfully combine, conspire, confederate and agree with EBRD Offficialâs
Sister, and others known and unknown to the grand jury, to commit offenses against the United
States, namely, violations of the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2; and
violations of the Travel Act, Title 18, United States Code, Section 1952(a)(3)(A), through
commercial bribery contrary to Title 18, Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann., Section 4108.
Object of the Conspiracy
33. The object of the conspiracy was for defendant DMITRIJ HARDER, EBRD

Officialâs Sister, and others, to enrich themselves by making payments to EBRD Officialâs Sister
to corruptly influence EBRD Officialâs actions on applications for financing submitted to the
EBRD by the clients of defendant HARDER and the Chestnut Group, and to corruptly influence

EBRD Official to direct business to defendant HARDER and the Chestnut Group.

Case 2:15-cr-00001-PD Document1 Filed 01/06/15 Page 11 of 23

Manner and Means of the Conspiracy

Officialâs Sister, and others, discussed the payment of bribes from HARDER to and for the
benefit of EBRD Official.

35. It was further part of the conspiracy that defendant DMITRIJ HARDER, EBRD
Officialâs Sister, and others, offered to pay, promised to pay, and authorized and caused the
payment of bribes, directly and indirectly, to and for the benefit of EBRD Official.

36. It was further part of the conspiracy that defendant DMITRIJ HARDER, EBRD
Officialâs Sister, and others, discussed the bank accounts belonging to EBRD Officialâs Sister
into which defendant HARDER would cause the bribe payments to be paid.

37. It was further part of the conspiracy that defendant DMITRIJ HARDER, EBRD
Officialâs Sister, and others, attempted to conceal the bribe payments to EBRD Official by
making payments to EBRD Officialâs Sister.

38. It was further part of the conspiracy that defendant DMITRIJ HARDER and
others caused the transfer of approximately $3.5 million in bribe payments to bank accounts
designated by EBRD Offficialâs Sister, to corruptly influence EBRD Officialâs actions on
applications for financing submitted to the EBRD by the clients of defendant HARDER and the
Chestnut Group, and to corruptly influence EBRD Official to direct business to the Chestnut
Group.

39. It was further part of the conspiracy that defendant DMITRIJ HARDER, EBRD
Officialâs Sister, and others, attempted to conceal the payments to EBRD Official by creating
false paperwork and justifications for the payments to EBRD Officialâs Sister, including by

creating invoices that falsely claimed she performed services for the Chestnut Group.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Tuesday, January 6, 2015

Former Owner and President of Pennsylvania Consulting Companies Charged with Foreign Bribery

The former owner and President of Chestnut Consulting Group Inc. and Chestnut Consulting Group Co. (generally referred to as the âChestnut
Groupâ) was indicted by a federal grand jury today for his alleged participation in a scheme to pay bribes to a foreign official in violation of the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and the Travel Act, and to launder proceeds of those crimes.

Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Zane David Memeger of the Eastern
District of Pennsylvania and Special Agent in Charge Edward J. Hanko of the FBIâs Philadelphia Division made the announcement.

âWe are committed to combating foreign corruption, across the globe and across all industries, through enforcement actions and prosecutions
of companies and the individuals who run those companies,â said Assistant Attorney General Caldwell. âAs alleged, in this case, the owner and
chief executive of a Pennsylvania financial consulting firm secured hundreds of millions of dollars in business by bribing a European banking
official. He now faces an indictment for corruption in federal court. Bribery of foreign officials undermines the public trust in government and
fair competition in business. The charges returned today reflect the clear message that we will root out corruption and prosecute individuals
who violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.â

âWe will aggressively investigate and prosecute individuals in our district who use corrupt means like bribery to influence foreign officials,â said
U.S. Attorney Memeger. âOur criminal statutes in this arena must be enforced to ensure fair dealing in a competitive global marketplace where
foreign officials often hold significant decision-making authority. The alleged conduct here was particularly reprehensible because it
undermined the legitimacy of a process designed to support businesses for the citizens of developing nations.â

âThis is a great example of the FBIâs ability to successfully coordinate with our international law enforcement partners to tackle corruption,â said
Special Agent in Charge Hanko. âBribery - foreign or domestic - cripples the notion of fair competition in the marketplace.â

Dmitrij Harder, 42, of Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania, the former owner and president of the Chestnut Group, was charged with one count of
conspiracy to violate the FCPA and Travel Act, five counts of violating the FCPA, five counts of violating the Travel Act, one count of conspiracy
to commit international money laundering, and two counts of money laundering.

According to allegations in the indictment, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) was a multilateral development
bank headquartered in London, England, and was owned by over 60 sovereign nations. Among other things, the EBRD provided financing for
development projects in emerging economies, primarily in Eastern Europe.

According to allegations in the indictment, Harder and others paid bribes for the benefit of a senior official at the EBRD in exchange for
influencing the officialâs actions on applications for financing submitted by the Chestnut Groupâs clients and for directing business to the
Chestnut Group. The EBRD ultimately approved applications for financing from two of the Chestnut Groupâs corporate clients; the first resulted
in the EBRD providing an $85 million investment and a 90 million Euro loan, while the second resulted in a $40 million investment and a $60
million convertible loan. The Chestnut Group allegedly earned approximately $8 million in âsuccess feesâ as a result of the EBRDâs approval of
these two applications.

The indictment alleges that Harder made five payments totaling more than $3.5 million to the sister of the EBRD official, in part as an effort to
conceal the bribes. These payments were allegedly made for purported consulting and other services provided to the Chestnut Group by the
officialâs sister, when in fact she provided no such services. Harder also allegedly participated in creating fake documents to justify these
payments.

The charges contained in the indictment are merely accusations, and the defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.
The case is being investigated by the FBIâs Philadelphia Division. The Criminal Division's Office of International Affairs also provided assistance.

The case is being prosecuted by Assistant Chief Leo R. Tsao of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Michelle Morgan
of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.

At all times relevant to this indictment, unless otherwise specified:

Introduction

1. Defendant DMITRIJ HARDER was a Russian national, naturalized German

citizen and permanent resident alien of the United States. Defendant HARDER was the
Case 2:15-cr-00001-PD Document1 Filed 01/06/15 Page 2 of 23

president and owner of both the Chestnut Consulting Group, Inc. (âChestnut Inc.â), which was
incorporated in the State of Pennsylvania, and the Chestnut Consulting Group, Co., which was
incorporated in the State of Delaware. Defendant HARDER operated through one or both of
these entities (generally referred to herein as the âChestnut Groupâ) purportedly to provide,
among other things, consulting services to companies seeking financing from multilateral
development banks. The Chestnut Group was located in Southampton, in the Eastern District of
Pennsylvania. Because both Chestnut Inc. and Chestnut Consulting Group, Co. had their
principal place of business in the United States and were organized under the laws of
Pennsylvania and Delaware, each was a âdomestic concern,â as that term is used in the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act (ââFCPAâ), Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2(h)(1)(A). Because
defendant HARDER was a resident of the United States, defendant HARDER was a âdomestic
concern,â and an officer, director, employee and agent of a âdomestic concern,â as that term is
used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2(h)()(A).

2. Between in or around 2007 through in or around 2009, defendant HARDER
engaged in a scheme to pay approximately $3.5 million in bribe payments for the benefit of a
foreign official to corruptly influence the foreign officialâs actions on applications for financing
submitted to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (âEBRDââ) by the clients
of defendant HARDER and the Chestnut Group, and to corruptly influence the foreign official to
direct business to defendant HARDER and the Chestnut Group, and others.

Additional Relevant Entities and Individuals

3. The EBRD was a multilateral development bank headquartered in London,

England, and was owned by over 60 sovereign nations. Among other things, the EBRD provided

debt and equity financing for development projects in emerging economies, primarily in Eastern
Europe. On or about June 18, 1991, the President of the United States signed Executive Order
12766 designating the EBRD as a âpublic international organization.ââ The EBRD was thus a
âpublic international organization,â as that term is defined in the FCPA, Title 15, United States
Code, Section 78dd-2(h)(2).

4. âEBRD Officialâ was a Russian and United Kingdom national residing in or
around London, England, and was a senior banker working in the Natural Resources Group at
the EBRD. As a senior banker, EBRD Official served as an Operations Leader in the Natural
Resources Group and was responsible for leading the review of applications submitted to the
EBRD for project financing, including loans and equity investments. EBRD Official thus had
the authority to influence the process for approving project financing, and setting the terms and
conditions for that financing. EBRD Official was a âforeign official,â as that term is used in the
FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2(h)(2). Defendant DMITRIJ HARDER
knew EBRD Official from business associations dating back to at least 1999.

5. âEBRD Officialâs Sisterâ was a Russian and United Kingdom national residing in
or around London, England, and was the sister of EBRD Official. EBRD Officialâs Sister
purportedly provided consulting and other business services for the Chestnut Group. In reality,
however, EBRD Officialâs Sister provided no such services to the Chestnut Group or defendant
HARDER.

6. âCompany Aâ was a Russian independent oil and gas company established in
2000. Company A had oil and gas operations in the Russian Federation. Company A retained

Chestnut Inc. purportedly to provide consulting and other services.
Case 2:15-cr-00001-PD Document1 Filed 01/06/15 Page 4 of 23

7. âCompany Bâ was an oil and gas company established in 2006 and incorporated
in the United Kingdom. Company B had oil and gas operations in the Russian Federation.
Company B retained Chestnut Inc. purportedly to provide consulting and other services.

The Bribery Scheme

8. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, Title 15, United States
Code, Sections 78dd-1, et seq. (âFCPAââ), prohibited certain classes of persons and entities from
corruptly making payments to foreign officials to assist in obtaining or retaining business.
Specifically, the FCPA prohibited certain corporations and individuals from willfully making use
of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce corruptly in furtherance of an offer,
payment, promise to pay, or authorization of the payment of money or anything of value to any
person, while knowing that all or a portion of such money or thing of value would be offered,
given, or promised, directly or indirectly, to a foreign official to influence the foreign official in
his or her official capacity, induce the foreign official to do or omit to do an act in violation of
his or her lawful duty, or to secure any improper advantage in order to assist in obtaining or
retaining business for or with, or directing business to, any person.

9. The Travel Act, Title 18, United States Code, Section 1952, was enacted by
Congress for the purpose of, among other things, making it unlawful for persons and businesses
to travel in interstate or foreign commerce or use the mail or any facility in interstate commerce
to promote, manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate the promotion, management, establishment
or carrying on of certain unlawful activity, including violations of state anti-bribery laws.

10. Between in or about 2007 and in or about 2009, defendant DMITRIJ HARDER,
through the Chestnut Group, worked as a financial consultant to companies seeking project

financing from the EBRD. For at least four of these applications, including those of Company A
Case 2:15-cr-00001-PD Document1 Filed 01/06/15 Page 5 of 23

and Company B, EBRD Official was the Operations Leader responsible for leading the
management of the application process and negotiating the terms and conditions of any financing
provided by the EBRD. Chestnut Inc. was retained by Company A and Company B despite its
relatively small size, distant location from the EBRD, and unproven track record as a financial
advisor. As set forth below, the EBRD ultimately approved the applications for project financing
for Company A and Company B.

Company Aâs Application for Financing to the EBRD

 

11. In or about August 2007, Company A approached defendant DMITRIJ HARDER
and the Chestnut Group to assist it in raising financing for a natural gas development project in
Russia.

12. In or about September 2007, defendant DMITRIJ HARDER sent EBRD Official
an email about obtaining project financing from the EBRD for Company A in connection with
the project in Russia referenced in paragraph 11 above.

13. In or about October 2007, Chestnut Inc. entered into a financial services
agreement with Company A, which was signed by defendant DMITRIJ HARDER, whereby
Company A agreed to pay Chestnut Inc. a âsuccess feeâ of a certain percentage of the funds
obtained by Company A from the EBRD. On or about December 24, 2007, the financial
services agreement was amended by a supplemental financial services agreement, which
defendant HARDER also signed on behalf of Chestnut Inc.

14. On or about April 29, 2008, based upon the recommendation of EBRD Official as
the Operations Leader for Company Aâs application, the EBRD approved an $85 million equity

investment in Company A.
Case 2:15-cr-00001-PD Document1 Filed 01/06/15 Page 6 of 23

15. On or about May 13, 2008, Chestnut Inc. entered into a new financial services
agreement with a holding company for Company A (the âHolding Companyââ) created for the
specific purpose of receiving the EBRD funding. This agreement was almost identical to the
supplemental agreement between Chestnut Inc. and Company A, except that the agreement
provided that Chestnut Inc. would assist the Holding Company, rather than Company A, to raise
financing. This agreement was also signed on behalf of Chestnut Inc. by defendant DMITRIJ
HARDER.

16. On or about June 4, 2008, the $85 million equity investment was disbursed by
EBRD to the Holding Company, on behalf of Company A.

17. On or about June 25, 2008, as a result of the approval of Company Aâs
application to the EBRD for financing, the Holding Company paid Chestnut Inc. a âsuccess feeâ
amounting to approximately $1.7 million.

18. On or about the following dates, after receiving the success fees from Company A
and the Holding Company, defendant DMITRIJ HARDER caused wire transfer payments to be
made in approximately the following amounts from Chestnut Inc.âs bank account at
Commerzbank in Frankfurt, Germany, to the Citibank bank account in Jersey, Channel Islands,

belonging to EBRD Officialâs Sister:

 

Approximate Date Approximate Amount
July 11, 2008 $300,000
September 16, 2008 $199,637
October 13, 2008 $253,665

19. On or about March 10, 2009, the EBRD approved additional project financing for

Company A, in the form of a senior loan totaling 90 million Euros.
20. On or about April 10, 2009, Chestnut Inc. and Company A entered into a further
supplemental financial services agreement, which rescinded the earlier success fee, and made the
new success fee payable on the original equity investment of $85 million and new senior loan of
90 million Euros. This supplemental financial services agreement was signed on behalf of
Chestnut Inc. by defendant DMITRIJ HARDER.

21. On or about June 18, 2009, Company A paid Chestnut Inc. a new success fee of
approximately $2.9 million, based upon both the equity investment and senior loan from the
EBRD to Company A.

22. On or about July 16, 2009, defendant DMITRIJ HARDER caused the wire
transfer of approximately $310,121 from Chestnut Inc.âs bank account at 3rd Federal Bank in
Feasterville, Pennsylvania to the Citibank bank account in Jersey, Channel Islands, belonging to
EBRD Officialâs Sister.

23. In all, Chestnut Inc. received payments from Company A totaling approximately
$2.9 million, and defendant DMITRIJ HARDER caused payments to be made to EBRD
Officialâs Sister totaling approximately $1.06 million. While EBRD Officialâs Sister purportedly
received these payments as a result of providing consulting and other business services to the
Chestnut Group, in reality, EBRD Officialâs Sister provided no such services. Instead, EBRD
Officialâs Sister received these payments for the benefit of EBRD Official, to corruptly influence
the foreign officialâs actions on applications for financing by the clients of defendant HARDER
and the Chestnut Group, and to corruptly influence the foreign official to direct business to

defendant HARDER and the Chestnut Group.

Company Bâs Application for Financing to the EBRD

 

24. In or about 2007, Company B initially approached the EBRD about obtaining
financing for a gas development project. Although it appeared that the EBRD would approve
Company Bâs application for financing, Company B ultimately declined to obtain financing from
the EBRD and instead obtained its financing from another international bank. Company B did
not use the services of a financial consultant in connection with its initial application to the
EBRD.

25. On or about May 7, 2009, Company B approached the EBRD again about
obtaining additional financing. EBRD Official and others from the EBRD met with
representatives from Company B to discuss Company Bâs interest in obtaining such financing.
EBRD Official was thereafter assigned as Operations Leader for Company Bâs application for
financing with the EBRD.

26. On or about May 19, 2009, Chestnut Inc. and Company B entered into a financial
services agreement, whereby Company B agreed to pay Chestnut Inc. a âsuccess feeâ of a certain
percentage of the funds obtained by Company B. The financial services agreement was signed
on behalf of Chestnut Inc. by defendant DMITRIJ HARDER.

27. On or about July 29, 2009, based upon the recommendation of EBRD Official as
the Operations Leader for Company Bâs application, the EBRD approved Company Bâs
application for financing consisting of a $40 million equity investment and a $60 million
convertible loan.

28. On or about October 1, 2009, Company B paid Chestnut Inc. a success fee of

approximately $4.9 million. Because on or about July 27, 2009, Company B had previously paid
Case 2:15-cr-00001-PD Document1 Filed 01/06/15 Page 9 of 23

Chestnut Inc. an initial payment of approximately $100,000 to be credited to any success fees,
the total success fee paid by Company B to Chestnut Inc. was approximately $5 million.

29. On or about November 20, 2009, after Chestnut Inc. received the success fees
from Company B, defendant DMITRIJ HARDER caused a payment of approximately
$2,478,580.89 to be made to EBRD Offficialâs Sister. Although EBRD Officialâs Sister
purportedly received these payments as a result of providing consulting and other business
services to the Chestnut Group, in reality, EBRD Officialâs Sister provided no such services.
Instead, EBRD Officialâs Sister received these payments for the benefit of EBRD Official, to
corruptly influence the foreign officialâs actions on applications for financing by the clients of
defendant HARDER and the Chestnut Group, and to corruptly influence the foreign official to
direct business to defendant HARDER and the Chestnut Group.

The Concealment of the Bribe Payments

 

30. Through the Chestnut Group, defendant DMITRIJ HARDER paid EBRD
Officialâs Sister approximately $3.5 million in bribe payments for the benefit of EBRD Official.

31. To conceal and cover up these bribe payments, defendant DMITRIJ HARDER
and EBRD Officialâs Sister created false paperwork to make it appear that EBRD Officialâs
Sister had provided services to the Chestnut Group for these payments, when in fact no such
services were provided. The false documents included the following:

a. an invoice dated May 20, 2009 from EBRD Officialâs Sister to the
Chestnut Group requesting payment of $310,141.04 for being a

â[p|roducing agent - various projects;â
Case 2:15-cr-00001-PD Document1 Filed 01/06/15 Page 10 of 23

b. a âConfirmation of Servicesâ letter, dated October 9, 2009, from
Chestnut Inc. to EBRD Officialâs Sister setting forth a âpre-agreed co-
brokerage feeâ in the amount of âup to $2.6 million;â and
c. an invoice dated November 18, 2009 from EBRD Officialâs Sister to
the Chestnut Group requesting payment of approximately
$2,478,580.89 for being a â[p]roducing agent - various projects.â
The Conspiracy Charge
32. From in or around 2007 through in or around November 2009, in the Eastern
District of Pennsylvania and elsewhere, defendant
DMITRIJ HARDER
did knowingly and willfully combine, conspire, confederate and agree with EBRD Offficialâs
Sister, and others known and unknown to the grand jury, to commit offenses against the United
States, namely, violations of the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2; and
violations of the Travel Act, Title 18, United States Code, Section 1952(a)(3)(A), through
commercial bribery contrary to Title 18, Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann., Section 4108.
Object of the Conspiracy
33. The object of the conspiracy was for defendant DMITRIJ HARDER, EBRD

Officialâs Sister, and others, to enrich themselves by making payments to EBRD Officialâs Sister
to corruptly influence EBRD Officialâs actions on applications for financing submitted to the
EBRD by the clients of defendant HARDER and the Chestnut Group, and to corruptly influence

EBRD Official to direct business to defendant HARDER and the Chestnut Group.

36. It was further part of the conspiracy that defendant DMITRIJ HARDER, EBRD
Officialâs Sister, and others, discussed the bank accounts belonging to EBRD Officialâs Sister
into which defendant HARDER would cause the bribe payments to be paid.

37. It was further part of the conspiracy that defendant DMITRIJ HARDER, EBRD
Officialâs Sister, and others, attempted to conceal the bribe payments to EBRD Official by
making payments to EBRD Officialâs Sister.

38. It was further part of the conspiracy that defendant DMITRIJ HARDER and
others caused the transfer of approximately $3.5 million in bribe payments to bank accounts
designated by EBRD Offficialâs Sister, to corruptly influence EBRD Officialâs actions on
applications for financing submitted to the EBRD by the clients of defendant HARDER and the
Chestnut Group, and to corruptly influence EBRD Official to direct business to the Chestnut
Group.

39. It was further part of the conspiracy that defendant DMITRIJ HARDER, EBRD
Officialâs Sister, and others, attempted to conceal the payments to EBRD Official by creating
false paperwork and justifications for the payments to EBRD Officialâs Sister, including by

creating invoices that falsely claimed she performed services for the Chestnut Group.

Former Owner and President of Pennsylvania Consulting Companies Pleads Guilty to Bribing
Official at European Bank for Reconstruction and Development

The former owner and president of Chestnut Consulting Group Inc. and Chestnut Consulting Group Co. (the Chestnut Group) pleaded guilty
today to bribing an official at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
(FCPA).

Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Zane David Memeger of the Eastern
District of Pennsylvania and Special Agent in Charge William F. Sweeney of the FBI's Philadelphia Division made the announcement.

Dmitrij Harder, 43, of Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania, a U.S. legal permanent resident, pleaded guilty to two counts of violating the FCPA
before U.S. District Judge Paul S. Diamond of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Sentencing is scheduled for July 21, 2016.

According to admissions made in connection with Harderâs plea, the EBRD was a multilateral development bank headquartered in London that
was owned by more than 60 sovereign nations and provided financing for development projects in emerging economies, primarily in Eastern
Europe. Harder admitted that between 2007 and 2009, he engaged in a scheme to pay approximately $3.5 million in bribes to an EBRD official
to corruptly influence the officialâs actions on applications for EBRD financing submitted by the Chestnut Groupâs clients and to influence the
official to direct business to the Chestnut Group.

The EBRD ultimately approved applications for financing from two of the Chestnut Groupâs corporate clients; the first resulted in the EBRD
providing an $85 million investment and a 90 million Euro loan, while the second resulted in a $40 million investment and a $60 million
convertible loan, according to the plea. Harder admitted that the Chestnut Group earned approximately $8 million in âsuccess feesâ as a result
of the EBRDâs approval of these two applications.

In a related action, the EBRD official, Andrey Ryjenko, and his sister, Tatjana Sanderson, have been charged by the United Kingdomâs Crown
Prosecution Service and are pending trial. A status conference in that matter is set for June 8, 2016.

The FBI's Philadelphia Division is investigating the case. Assistant U.S. Attorney Michelle Morgan of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and
Senior Trial Attorney Jason Linder of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section are prosecuting the case. The City of London Policeâs Overseas Anti
Corruption Unit and the Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs provided assistance. Germany, Jersey and Guernsey also provided
assistance in this matter.

Defendant.

THE GRAND JURY CHARGES:

At all times relevant to this Indictment, unless otherwise stated:

 

I. The Defendant and Relevant Individuals and Entities

i The defendant DONVILLE INNISS, a United States lawful permanent
resident who resided in Tampa, Florida, and Barbados, was a member of the Parliament of
Barbados and the Minister of Industry, International Business, Commerce, and Small Business
Development of Barbados (collectively, âMinister of Industryâ). INNISS was a public official
in Barbados.

2, The âBarbados Company,â a corporation the identity of which is known to
the Grand Jury, was an insurance company headquartered in Barbados that offered various
financial products, including individual life, health and casualty insurance.

3 Barbados Company Executive 1, an individual whose identity is known to
the Grand Jury, was a citizen of Canada and a resident of Barbados. Barbados Company

Executive 1 was the Chief Executive Officer (âCEOâ) of the Barbados Company.
4. Barbados Company Executive 2, an individual whose identity is known to
the Grand Jury, was a citizen of Barbados and a resident of Barbados. Barbados Company
Executive 2 was a senior vice president of the Barbados Company.

3 Barbados Company Executive 3, an individual whose identity is known to
the Grand Jury, was a citizen of Barbados and a resident of Barbados. Barbados Company
Executive 3 was the Chief Financial Officer of the Barbados Company.

6. The âBermuda Company,â a corporation the identity of which is known to
the Grand Jury, was an insurance company headquartered in Bermuda that offered various
financial products, including life, property and casualty insurance. The Bermuda Company was
the majority shareholder of the Barbados Company.

7. The âNew York Dental Company,â a corporation the identity of which is
known to the Grand Jury, was a dental company that was incorporated in New York in 1992 and
had an address in Elmont, New York.

8. Co-Conspirator 1 (âCC-1â), an individual whose identity is known to the
Grand Jury, was a United States citizen and a resident of Tampa, Florida. CC-1 was the CEO of
the New York Dental Company and owned and controlled the company.

9. The Barbados Investment and Development Corporation (âBIDCââ) was an
agency of the government of Barbados. The defendant DONVILLE INNISS, as the Minister of
Industry, exercised authority over the BIDC.

Il. The Fraudulent Schemes

10. From in or about and between August 2015 and April 2016, the defendant

DONVILLE INNISS leveraged his positon as the Minister of Industry and engaged in a scheme

to accept approximately $36,000 in bribes from the Barbados Company, in violation of
Barbadian law, and to launder that money to and through the United States. Employees of the
Barbados Company, including Barbados Company Executives 1 and 2, agreed to pay bribes to
INNISS, who, in return, agreed to use his official position as the Minister of Industry to cause the
BIDC to renew insurance contracts with the Barbados Company.

11. In furtherance of the scheme, Barbados Company Executives 1, 2 and 3
caused the Barbados Companyâs majority shareholder, the Bermuda Company, to make bribe
payments to the defendant DONVILLE INNISS through a United States bank account in the
name of the New York Dental Company, which had no actual business with the Barbados
Company. The Barbados Company employees, including Barbados Company Executives 1, 2
and 3, did not disclose to the Bermuda Company that the payments were for the benefit of a
Barbadian government official and instead falsely claimed that the payments were for
âTclonsulting services.â

12. In furtherance of the scheme, in or about July 2015, the defendant
DONVILLE INNISS, using his official position as Minister of Industry, caused the BIDC to
renew an insurance contract with the Barbados Company (the â2015 Contractâ). By its terms,
the 2015 Contract required the BIDC to pay a premium of approximately $944,956.12 to the
Barbados Company and another insurance company.

13. In return, employees of the Barbados Company, including Barbados
Company Executives | and 2, agreed to pay a bribe of approximately $16,536.73 to the
defendant DONVILLE INNISS, in consideration for having caused the BIDC to renew the 2015
Contract. The bribe payment of approximately $16,536.73 was 1.75 percent of the premium
that the BIDC owed to the Barbados Company and another insurance company under the 2015

Contract.
14. | Toconceal the bribe payments, the defendant DONVILLE INNISS
arranged to launder the bribes through âBank 1,â a bank the identity of which is known to the
Grand Jury, with an address in Elmont, New York, in the name of the New York Dental
Company (the âNew York Dental Company Bank Accountâ). The payment was routed through
a branch of Bank 1 located in Brooklyn, New York. CC-1, a friend of INNISS, was the
authorized representative of the New York Dental Company Bank Account.

15. On or about August 17, 2015, the Bermuda Company transferred
approximately $16,536.73 to the New York Dental Company Bank Account based on a false
invoice provided by Barbados Company Executives 1, 2 and 3 for consulting services. On or
about August 19, 2015, the New York Dental Company transferred approximately $16,000 to a
Bank 1 account in the United States in the name of the defendant DONVILLE INNISS (the
âINNISS Bank Accountâ) via a check transaction. The New York Dental Company check for
approximately $16,000 was made payable to INNISS.

16. In or about March 2016, the defendant DONVILLE INNISS, using his
position as Minister of Industry, caused the BIDC to renew another insurance contract with the
Barbados Company (the â2016 Contractâ).

17. In return, employees of the Barbados Company, including Barbados
Company Executives | and 2, agreed to pay an additional bribe of approximately $20,000 to the
defendant DONVILLE INNISS, in consideration for having caused the BIDC to renew the 2016
Contract.

18. On or about April 18, 2016, the Bermuda Company transferred
approximately $20,000 to the New York Dental Company Bank Account based on a false

invoice provided by Barbados Company Executives 1, 2 and 3 for consulting services. On or
about April 25, 2016, the New York Dental Company made transfers of approximately $9,000
and $8,000 to the INNISS Bank Account via check transactions. The New York Dental
Company checks for approximately $9,000 and $8,000 were made payable to the defendant
DONVILLE INNISS. On or about April 27, 2016, the New York Dental Company transferred
approximately $2,750 to the INNISS Bank Account via a check transaction. The New York
Dental Company check for $2,750 was made payable to INNISS.

Ii. Barbados Prevention of Corruption Act

19. The Prevention of Corruption Act of Barbados (the âBarbados Prevention
of Corruption Actâ) provided in Section 3(1) that â[a]ny person who, by himself or by or in
conjunction with any person, corruptly solicits or receives or agrees to receive, for himself or for

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Thursday, January 16, 2020

Former Member of Barbados Parliament and Minister of Industry Found Guilty of Receiving and
Laundering Bribes from Barbadian Insurance Company

A former member of the Barbados Parliament, who also served as the Minister of Industry of Barbados, was found guilty today by a federal jury
for his role in a scheme to launder bribes paid to him by executives of the Insurance Corporation of Barbados Limited (ICBL).

Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Richard P. Donoghue of the Eastern
District of New York and Assistant Director in Charge William F. Sweeney Jr. of the FBIâs New York Field Office made the announcement.

Following a one-week trial and two hours of jury deliberations, Donville Inniss, 54, a U.S. legal permanent resident who resided in Tampa,
Florida, and Barbados, was found guilty of two counts of money laundering and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering.
Sentencing has not yet been scheduled.

According to the evidence presented at trial, in 2015 and 2016, Inniss took part in a scheme to launder into the United States approximately
$36,000 in bribes that he received from high-level executives of ICBL. At the time, Inniss was a member of the Parliament of Barbados and the
Minister of Industry, International Business, Commerce, and Small Business Development of Barbados. The trial evidence demonstrated that, in
exchange for the bribes, Inniss leveraged his position as the Minister of Industry to enable ICBL to obtain two insurance contracts from the
Barbados government to insure over $100 million worth of government property. To conceal the bribes, Inniss arranged to receive them
through a U.S. bank account in the name of his friendâs dental company, which had an address in Elmont, New York. The trial evidence further
showed that Inniss used a personal email account to communicate with an executive from ICBL in connection with the bribe payments and the
laundering of the money through the dental company in New York.

The FBI's International Corruption Squad in New York City investigated the case. In 2015, the FBI formed International Corruption Squads across
the country to address national and international implications of foreign corruption. Trial Attorney Gerald M. Moody Jr. of the Criminal Divisionâs
Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys David Gopstein and Sylvia Shweder of the Eastern District of New York prosecuted the case. The
Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs also provided assistance in this matter. The Department appreciates the cooperation provided
by its law enforcement colleagues in Barbados during this investigation.

The Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice Departmentâs FCPA
enforcement efforts can be found at www. justice. gov/criminal-fr foreign-corrupt-practi

agencies facilitated intercountry adoptions from Uganda, Poland, and elsewhere. The State
Department could use this information to evaluate whether adoption agencies were complying with
applicable regulations, as appropriate.

13. Ugandan laws provided, among other things, that children should only be separated
from their parents when a court determined that doing so would be beneficial to the child.
Probation and social welfare officers (âwelfare officersâ) in Uganda were responsible for
identifying vulnerable children and, when appropriate, applying for judicial âcare ordersâ that
would authorize persons other than a childâs parents to care for the child. To support a care order
application, welfare officers were required to interview the childâs parents, nearest relatives or
guardians and then submit a wtitten âwelfare reportâ describing why the child was vulnerable.

14. Magistrate Judges of the Family and Childrenâs Court of Uganda (âMagistrate
Judgesâ) were required to review the welfare report and determine whether to issue a care order

placing the child into an orphanage.

Intercountry Adoption from Uganda to the United States

15. Prospective adoptive parents from the United States that sought to adopt Ugandan
orphans could do so by obtaining a guardianship order from the Family Division of the High Court
of Uganda (âUgandan High Courtâ), obtaining a visa to bring the child to the United States, and
then bringing the child to the United States to complete the adoption. At the Ugandan High Court,
the court registrar was responsible for assigning each guardianship application to a judge.

16. Guardianship applicants provided written submissions, including the welfare report
and care order, to support their applications. Ugandan High Court judges held hearings to
adjudicate guardianship applications and issued guardianship orders in writing. Once a
prospective adoptive parent obtained a guardianship order, he or she would then apply to the State
Department for an IR4 visa to bring the child to the United States. The prospective adoptive parent .
was typically interviewed at the U.S. Embassy in Kampala, Uganda in connection with their
prospective adopteeâs visa applications. The prospective adoptive parent was required, among
other things, to provide truthful information about the circumstances by which the child was
determined to be an orphan.

Details of the Uganda Criminal Schemes

17. In or around 2012, Adoption Agency started a program to facilitate adoptions of
Ugandan children by prospective adoptive parents in the United States. From at least 2012 to in
or around 2016, PARRIS managed Adoption Agencyâs adoption program in Uganda in
coordination with Longoria and others.

18. In or around 2013, Adoption Agency entered into an agreement with MIREMBE
to provide adoption-related services to Adoption Agency. PARRIS selected MIREMBE for this

role as Adoption Agencyâs foreign supervised provider in Uganda. Adoption Agency, through

 
 

a: D2 O-crf10424-SO Doc #1 Filed: OS/13/20 6 of 44.

   

PARRIS and others, communicated frequently with MIREMBE about her work for Adoption
Agency while it was in progress and provided her with instructions regarding the intercountry
adoptions that she was facilitating for Adoption Agency clients. Adoption Agency, through
PARRIS and others, directed its clients in the Uganda program to hire MIREMBE as their attorney
for adoption-related proceedings. Adoption Agency, through PARRIS and others, also supervised
MIREMBEâs work, including by requiring her to provide detailed descriptions of the services she
performed before receiving payment. Furthermore, federal regulations required Adoption Agency
to adequately supervise MIREMBE or risk being debarred by the State Department.

19. Between in or around 2013 and in or around 2016, PARRIS, MIREMBE, and others
participated in criminal schemes (1) to bribe Ugandan government officials in order to corruptly
procure adoptions of Ugandan children who PARRIS and MIREMBE knew had not been properly
determined to be orphans or otherwise to be eligible for intercountry adoption; (2) to make material
misrepresentations and to conceal material facts from Adoption Agency clients in order to obtain
money from Adoption Agency clients, including, among other things, to conceal from Adoption
Agency clients facts relating to the circumstances of the children to be adopted and the fact that
PARRIS, MIREMBE, and their co-conspirators were procuring these adoptions through bribery
and other improper means; (3) to wire money from the United States to Uganda, in part, to provide
money for the bribes; and (4) to cause Adoption Agencyâs clients to submit fraudulent visa
applications in connection with these adoptions. Many of the Ugandan children whose adoptions
PARRIS and MIREMBE had procured through bribery and fraud were not properly determined to
be orphans, and certain of the children were ultimately returned to their birth mothers in Uganda
after Adoption Agencyâs clients came to believe that these birth mothers had not knowingly given

their children up for adoption. During this same period, Adoption Agency, in collaboration with

 

 
 

Case: LipO-cr-00424-S0 Doc 1 Filled: O8/13feÂ¢

 

MIREMBE, procured the adoption of more than 30 Ugandan children by U.S. clients. Adoption
Agency received more than $900,000 from these clients. MIREMBE received more than $430,000
from Adoption Agency, as well as tens of thousands of dollars directly from Adoption Agencyâs
clients for representing them in Uganda.
PARRIS, MIREMBE, and their Co-Conspirators bribe Ugandan officials

20. PARRIS, MIREMBE, and their co-conspirators presented Ugandan children who
had not yet been determined to be orphans to Adoption Agencyâs clients for potential adoption.
PARRIS then authorized Adoption Agency to send funds to MIREMBE, knowing that MIREMBE
would use these funds, in part, to bribe Ugandan government officials to corruptly cause the
adoptions of these children. These bribes included bribes to the following individuals, each of
whom was a âforeign officialâ as that term is used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code,
Sections 78dd-2(h)(2)(A): (1) bribes to a welfare officer, so that the welfare officer would
recommend that children be placed into orphanages without first ensuring that the children were
actually orphaned or that putting them up-for adoption was in their best interest; (2) bribes to a
Ugandan magistrate judge, so that the magistrate judge would issue care orders based on the
corruptly procured welfare reports and place the children in an orphanage in the Kampala district
of Uganda (âKampala Orphanage Aâ) that was willing to accept the children without inquiring
into whether they were actually orphans; (3) bribes to court registrars to get them to assign cases
to corrupt âadoption-friendlyâ judges; and (4) bribes to Ugandan High Court judges to obtain
guardianship orders to permit Adoption Agencyâs clients to bring the children to the United States
for adoption.

21. For example, MIREMBE and others working at MIREMBEâs direction used

money from Adoption Agency to pay bribes to a welfare officer in the Kayunga district of Uganda
 

Case: LipO-cr-00424-S0 Doct: 1 Filed: O8/13feÂ¢ Pp.

 

(âKayunga Welfare Officer 1â) in exchange for Kayunga Welfare Officer 1 signing welfare reports
that recommended placing children into an orphanage. These corruptly procured welfare reports
were not based on Kayunga Welfare Officer 1âs independent determinations that these children
had to be placed in an orphanage. Rather, as PARRIS and MIREMBE knew and intended,
Kayunga Welfare Officer 1 provided welfare reports for these children because MIREMBE and
people working at MIREMBEâs direction brought the children to Kayunga Welfare Officer 1 and
paid bribes to Kayunga Welfare Officer 1 t6 corruptly obtain the welfare reports.

22. MIREMBE, at times assisted by employees of Law Firm A who were working at
her direction, drafted welfare reports and directed the employees to deliver them to Kayunga
Welfare Officer 1. Kayunga Welfare Officer | signed the welfare reports prepared by MIREMBE
and the Law Firm A employees upon receiving cash bribes. These welfare reports at times falsely
overstated the childrenâs need for care and orphan status. For example, one welfare report falsely
and fraudulently stated that the whereabouts of a childâs father were unknown.

23. In many instances, these welfare reports also often recommended that the children
be placed in âKampala Orphanage A,â even though it was in the Kampala district of Uganda,
which was approximately two hours away from the Kayunga districtâthe district that the children
were from and where there were available orphanages. -MIREMBE steered the children to
Kampala Orphanage A because MIREMBE knew that the director of Kampala Orphanage A
would accept the children without scrutinizing whether the children had any alternatives for care.
MIREMBE also steered the children to Kampala Orphanage A because the director of Kampala
Orphanage A was willing to sign affidavits drafted by MIREMBE for submission to the Ugandan

High Court without questioning them.

 

 
 

Case: LipO-cr-00424-S0 Doct: 1 Filed: O8/13feÂ¢ Pp.

 

24. PARRIS, MIREMBE and their co-conspirators caused Adoption Agency to wire
funds from the Adoption Agencyâs Ohio-based account to bank accounts controlled by MIREMBE
in Uganda for the purpose of promoting the bribery scheme and knowing that the funds would be
used, in part, to fund the bribes to Ugandan officials. .

PARRIS, MIREMBE, and their Co-Conspirators provide false information to, and conceal
material information from, Adoption Agencyâs clients

25. PARRIS and MIREMBE and their co-conspirators took steps to conceal, among
other things: (1) the bribery scheme; (2) the fees associated with the bribery scheme that were
charged to Adoption Agency clients; and (3) other material facts from Adoption Agencyâs clients
in order to obtain money from Adoption Agency clients.

26. For example, Adoption Agency sent invoices via email to Adoption Agency clients
that falsely and fraudulently concealed the bribes to court registrars as âcourt filing fees.â
MIREMBE, and Law Firm A employees working at MIREMBEâs direction, also sent invoices to
Adoption Agency via email thatâ-as PARRIS, MIREMBE and their co-conspirators knewâ
falsely described bribes to Ugandan Judges as âjudgeâs fees.â

27. In or about October 2015, an Adoption Agency client asked PARRIS and others
the reason Adoption Agency charged the client a âcourt filing fee.â The client was not told the
truth.

28. Subsequently, in order to better conceal the money that Adoption Agency clients
were being charged in order to fund the bribery scheme, PARRIS, and her co-conspirators began
concealing the cost of the bribes within the âForeign Program Feesâ that were charged to Adoption
Agencyâs clients. Adoption Agency clients in the Uganda program were often charged more than

$10,000 each in âForeign Program Fees.â

 
ease: Liz0-cr-00424-S0 Doc#i 1 Filed: 08/13/20 LO of 44, P

   

29. PARRIS, MIREMBE, and their co-conspirators also deceived Adoption Agencyâs
clients about the circumstances of the children to be adopted, including by providing Adoption
Agency clients with fraudulent welfare reports that were corruptly procured and by concealing that
the children were not properly determined to be eligible for intercountry adoption.

30. Â° For example, on or about October 14, 2014, PARRIS called an Adoption Agency
client and informed the client that a certain child was potentially available for adoption, even
though PARRIS knew the child was not eligible to be referred for adoption at that time. In or
around February 2015, Adoption Agency sent a referral package via email to the Adoption Agency
client that included the childâs welfare report, which had been corruptly procured through bribery.
The corruptly obtained welfare report falsely stated that the childâs mother âis helpless [and]
cannot provide the basic needs of the child.â The referral package also included a copy of a care
order signed by a magistrate judge that was also corruptly obtained through bribery, and which
recommended that the child be placed in the care of Kampala Orphanage A.

31. After the Adoption Agency client completed the adoption of the child, and while
the child was living in the Adoption Agency clientâs home in the United States, the Adoption
Agency client came to believe that certain information she had received in the welfare report was
false and that the: childâs birth mother had not knowingly given the child up for adoption. The
Adoption Agency Client coordinated with an individual residing in Uganda, who traveled to the
childâs home village on or about March 25, 2016, seeking additional information regarding the
childâs true background. PARRIS learned of this visit and called Adoption Agency client within
approximately one day. PARRIS told the client, in sum and substance, that the client should not
further inquire about the childâs background and that the client was putting at risk Adoption

Agencyâs ability to facilitate additional adoptions from the childâs village. Following this phone

10

 

 

 

 

 
ease: Liz0-cr-00424-S0 Doc#i 1 Filed: 08/13/20 Ll of 44. P

   

call, the client obtained the services of a social worker in the United States to assess the childâs
best interests.

32. In or around September 2016, the Adoption Agency client traveled with the child
to Uganda, reunited the child with the childâs birth mother, and relinquished parental rights over
the child back to the childâs birth mother. In total, in connection with the adoption of the child,
the Adoption Agency client made three trips to Uganda, paid approximately $25,000 to Adoption
Agency, paid more than $10,000 dollars to MIREMBE, paid more than $5,000 to an individual
affiliated with MIREMBE and Law Firm A, and incurred thousands of dollars in additional
expenses, including expenses to obtain social work services and legal services in the United States.

PARRIS misrepresents and conceals additional
material information from an Adoption Agency client

33. In or around August 2015, PARRIS referred a Ugandan child to an Adoption
Agency client for potential adoption. PARRIS falsely informed the Adoption Agency client that
the child had not been adopted by another Adoption Agency client solely because the child wanted
to be adopted into a home with a mother and a father, and PARRIS concealed from the Adoption
Agency client, among other things: (1) that the other Adoption Agency client had adopted the
childâs sibling, but had chosen to abandon the child in Uganda after having obtained a guardianship
order establishing custody over the child and spending weeks living with the child and the childâs
sibling in Uganda; and (2) that the welfare report for the child had been corruptly obtained through
bribery.

34. On or about December 28, 2015, PARRIS caused an Adoption Agency employee
to send the Adoption Agency client an email, which, among other things, included the corruptly

obtained welfare report as an attachment and requested that the Adoption Agency client pay

ll

 

 
ease: Liz0-cr-00424-S0 Doc #1 Filed: 08/13/20 12 of 44, P

   

Adoption Agency $10,010 in connection with the adoption of the child, including $9,335 for the
âForeign Program Fee.â

35. Onor about December 31, 2015, the Adoption Agency Client mailed a check from
West Virginia to Adoption Agencyâs office in Strongsville, Ohio in the amount of $10,010.
Adoption Agency deposited this check into the Adoption Agencyâs Ohio-based account on or
about January 4, 2016.

36. The Adoption Agency client traveled to Uganda in or around March 2016 to pursue
the adoption of the child. By that time, the Adoption Agency client had already paid Adoption
Agency approximately $26,000 in connection with this potential adoption. While in Uganda, the
Adoption Agency Client learned that she had been misled by PARRIS about the circumstances
under which the child had become available for adoption.

37. In or around September 2016, the Adoption Agency learned that the Adoption â
Agency client described in Paragraphs 30 through 32 had repatriated a Ugandan adoptee to Uganda
based on concerns that the childâs birth mother was manipulated into giving her child up for
adoption. PARRIS was concerned that other Adoption Agency clients would do so as well, and
that the repatriations would harm Adoption Agencyâs reputation. In October 2016, Longoria tried
to arrange a telephone call between PARRIS and the Adoption Agency client. Longoria wrote,
â(PARRIS] and I received some information this morning from Uganda that we need to share and
discuss with you.â The Adoption agency client responded by asking Longoria to put any
information in writing. Longoria wrote to PARRIS, âAre you going to write to [the Adoption

Agency client]?â PARRIS responded, âNo donât want to put on paper.â

38. In or around November 2016, the Adoption Agency client repatriated the child to
Uganda based on concerns that the childâs birth mother was manipulated into giving her child up
for adoption.

PARRIS, MIREMBE, and their Co-Conspirators cause their clients to submit false information to
the State Department to conceal their marketing of children who have not been properly
determined to be eligible for intercountry adoption

39. PARRIS, MIREMBE, and others also conspired to cause Adoption Agencyâs
clients to provide false information and to submit false documents to the State Department,
including the submission of corruptly obtained fraudulent welfare reports, in order to obtain the
visas necessary to bring the adoptive.children to the United States.

40. For example, in or around May 2015, PARRIS, MIREMBE, and their co-
conspirators caused the Adoption Agency client described in paragraphs 30 to 32 to submit the
false and corruptly obtained welfare report to the State Department in order to procure an IR4 visa
for the child.

41, In another example, PARRIS, MIREMBE, and their co-conspirators created, and
caused to be created, a welfare report for a child that falsely identified the wrong person as the
childâs birth mother and falsely stated that the childâs biological father was deceased. MIREMBE
further attempted to get an Adoption Agency client to submit to the State Department, in
connection with obtaining an IR4 visa for the child, documents that falsely indicated that the
correct birth mother for the child had been identified at the time that the Adoption Agency referred

the child to the Adoption Agency client. PARRIS, in sum and substance, recommended that the

13

 
6) LiO-cr-00424-SO Doc#i 1 Filed: 08/13/20 14 of 44, Pes

   

Adoption Agency client allow MIREMBE to submit the false documents to the State Department
as part of the visa application.

42. In another example, on or about May 19, 2015, MIREMBE emailed PARRIS and
Longoria and instructed them to create false documents in association with an IR4 visa application
to be submitted to the State Department by an Adoption Agency client because otherwise âit will
be problematic at embassy.â In response to the request, Longoria created documents falsely
representing the date upon which Adoption Agency referred the child to the client in order to
conceal the short amount of time child had been in the orphanage before being referred for
intercountry adoption. Longoria, in coordination with PARRIS, provided the false and fraudulent
documents to the client, and, on or about July 30, 2015, MIREMBE caused the client to submit
the false and fraudulent documents to the State Department as part the visa application.

Intercountry Adoption from Poland to the United States

43.  Atall times relevant to this Indictment, the Council on Accreditation (âCOAâ) was
the entity responsible for accrediting any agency in the United States that sought to provide
intercountry adoption services. COA required accredited adoption agencies to provide annual
certifications attesting that they were in substantial compliance with applicable regulations, and to
timely report certain events, including dissolved adoptions and abuse of adoptees. COA also could
suspend or cancel an adoption agencyâs accreditation to facilitate intercountry adoptionsâif it was
out of compliance with applicable laws, regulations, policies, or procedures.

44. The Ministry of Family, Labor, and Social Policy (the âPolish Central Authorityâ)
was the Polish government agency that determined, among other things, whether an adoption
service provider was permitted to facilitate intercountry adoptions in Poland. For each

intercountry adoption from Poland, adoption service providers were required to transmit a home

14

 

 

 
ease: Liz0-cr-00424-S0 Doc#i 1 Filed: 08/13/20 15 0f 44, P

   

study of prospective adoptive parents, which included a criminal background check on all adults
living in the home, to the Polish Central Authority. The State Department was also required to
send a letter to. the Polish Central Authority indicating its approval for particular United States
prospective adoptive parents to adopt particular Polish children. The State Department also had
to approve a visa for the prospective adoptee to be brought to the United States for adoption.

45. Adoption service providers were obligated to report any disruption or dissolution
of an intercountry adoption to the Council on Accreditation within 30 business days. Adoption
service providers were also required to report any disruption of an intercountry adoption from
Poland to the Polish Central Authority.

Details of the Poland Criminal Scheme

46. Adoption Agency had established an adoption program in Poland in or around
2014. The Poland program was an important potential revenue source for COLE and Adoption
Agency.

47. Poland Client was a client of Adoption Agency who transferred into Adoption
Agencyâs Poland program in or around 2015. Poland Client originally expressed a preference to
adopt one child. In or around early 2015, after Adoption Agency informed Poland Client about
the potential of adopting two siblings (Child | and Child 2), Poland Client initially agreed to adopt
both siblings.

48. On or about March 4, 2015, the State Department sent a letter to the Polish Central
Authority that indicated the State Departmentâs approval for Poland Client to adopt Child 1 and
Child 2. The Polish Central Authority also received the completed home study for Poland Client

that showed Poland Clientâs suitability to complete an intercountry adoption.

15
ease: Liz0-cr-00424-S0 Doc#i 1 Filed: 08/13/20 16 of 44, P

   

49. Â° In or around May 2015, Poland Client traveled to Poland. In Poland, Co-
Conspirator 1 was introduced to Poland Client as Adoption Agencyâs in-country representative.
Over the course of weeks in Poland with Child 1 and Child 2, Poland Client developed concerns
as to whether Poland Client could adequately meet the physical and emotional needs of both
siblings. Poland Client expressed that concern to Co-Conspirator 1. In response, Co-Conspirator
1 told Poland Client that if Poland Client did not adopt both siblings, they would be âred-markedâ
and unlikely to be adopted by anyone else. Co-Conspirator 1, in sum and substance, also told
Poland Client to adopt both siblings and then, once in the United States, find another family in the
United States to adopt Child 2.

50. At around the time that Co-Conspirator 1 pressured Poland Client to adopt both
siblings, Adoption Agency had approximately 40 pending clients in the Poland program. These
pending clients represented more than $1 million of potential revenue to Adoption Agency, and
hundreds of thousands of dollars of potential revenue to Co-Conspirator 1âs company.

51. Poland Client contacted COLE for assistance. In an email to COLE dated on or
about June 21, 2015, Poland Client described the concerns about raising both Child 1 and Child 2.
Poland Client expressed a strong desire to find another family to raise Child 2. Poland Client also
offered to travel to wherever in the United States that the other family resided to deliver Child 2
to that other family.

52. After receiving no response from COLE, Poland Client emailed COLE again three
days later and again expressed Poland Clientâs intention not to keep custody of Child 2. Poland
Client wrote to COLE, âI just want to follow up from my last email to see if there is anything [we]

need to be doing to make the process run more smoothly for the dissolution.â

16
ease: Liz0-cr-00424-S0 Doc#i 1 Filed: 08/13/20 17 of 44, P

   

53. COLE identified for Poland Client a few persons who would potentially adopt
Child 2, including Parris Relatives | and 2. COLE described Parris Relatives 1 and 2 as having a
biological child close in age to Child 2, which Poland Client believed made them a good fit. On
or about June 29, 2015, Poland Client emailed COLE, âWe are hopefully coming home sometime
this week and we need to make a plan... We both feel that we would prefer that [Child 2] is with
[Parris Relatives | and 2]... Have [Parris Relatives 1 and 2] been working on their home study?â
COLE never responded to that question.

54, Poland Client, while still in Poland, was told that Parris Relatives 1 and 2 were
relatives of PARRIS. Poland Client and PARRIS spoke multiple times by phone about Child 2.
Based on these conversations, Poland Client understood that PARRIS expected that Parris
Relatives | and 2.would permanently adopt Child 2. Poland Client and PARRIS agreed that Poland
Client would travel from Poland to Texas with Child 1 and Child 2, where Poland Client would
meet PARRIS at the airport and, through PARRIS, transfer Child 2 to Parris Relatives | and 2.

55. On or about June 27, 2015, Poland Clientâs adoptions of Child 1 and Child 2
became final under Polish law. .

56. On or about July 1, 2015, Poland Client applied for United States visas for Child 1
and Child 2 and was interviewed at the United States Embassy in Warsaw, Poland. Poland Client,
based on instructions from Co-Conspirator 1, did not mention that Poland Client had taken steps
to transfer custody of Child 2 to another family upon arrival in the United States. Rather, the visa
applications indicated that both Child.1 and Child 2 would live at Poland Clientâs home address.
On or about July 2, 2015, Poland Client obtained visas for both siblings. ,

57. On or about July 4, 2015, Poland Client traveled from Poland to Dallas/Fort Worth

International Airport (DFW Airport) with Child 1 and Child 2. There, Poland Client met PARRIS,

17
ease: Liz0-cr-00424-S0 Doc#i 1 Filed: 08/13/20 18 of 44, P

   

who had arranged for an attorney in Texas to draft documentation related to the transfer of custody
of Child 2 from Poland Client to Parris Relatives | and 2. PARRIS also arranged for Longoria to
meet them at DFW Airport to notarize the signatures on the transfer of custody paperwork.

58. Poland Client signed the documents at DFW Airport. PARRIS took Child 2 from
Poland Client: Poland Client traveled to her home with Child 1. Parris Relative 2, who
accompanied PARRIS to DFW but did not meet Poland Client, took custody of Child 2, who then
lived with Parris Relatives 1 and 2.

59. Adoption Agency had not obtained a home study or a criminal background check
of Parris Relatives 1 and 2âalthough COLE, PARRIS, and Co-Conspirator | all knew that
families pursuing intercountry adoptions from Poland were required to complete home studies and
undergo background checks.

60. In the months following July 4, 2015, Adoption Agency failed to inform the
Council on Accreditation, the State Department, and the Polish Central Authority that it had
facilitated the transfer of Child 2 from Poland Client to Parris Relatives 1 and 2, notwithstanding
its obligation under federal regulations to do so. COLE and PARRIS knew, however, that Parris
Relatives 1 and 2 continued to have custody of Child 2 and that Parris Relatives | and 2 intended
for the arrangement to be permanent.

61, On or about August 27, 2015, PARRIS sent an email to COLE and another
Adoption Agency employee that contained a proposed entry by PARRIS for an Adoption Agency
blog, in which PARRIS wrote, â[Parris Relatives 1 and 2] just adopted a young [child] from Poland
... Thad guided them through the process of international adoption on everything they could

expect from this journey...â

18
SASe! LQO-cr0424-SO Doct 1 Filed: O8/S5/20 19 of 44. Pp

   

62. Parris Relatives | and 2 attempted to finalize the adoption of Child 2 under Texas
law. In order to do so, Parris Relative 2 provided a licensed clinical social worker with information
about Parris Relative 2âs criminal history, which included an arrest for domestic violence.
PARRIS learned of Parris Relative 2âs criminal history no later than in or around December 2015.
Parris Relatives 1 and 2 completed the adoption of Child 2 under Texas law in or around February
2016.

63. On or about April 18, 2016, in order to conceal the conduct related to the adoption
of Child 2 by Parris Relative 1 and 2, COLE caused Adoption Agency to submit a false report to
the Council on Accreditation related to the âdisruption / dissolutionâ of the adoption of Child 2
(the âApril 2016 COA Reportâ). The April 2016 COA Report contained the following false
statements, among others: (1) that Poland Client initially transferred Child 2 to Parris Relatives 1
and 2 for respite (temporary) care; and (2) that the âdisruption / dissolutionâ of the adoption of
Child 2 occurred within 30 days of the report (on March 21, 2016), even though Parris Relatives
1 and 2 took custody of Child 2 in July 2015 and completed the adoption of Child 2 under Texas
law of in Februaryâ2016. The April 2016 COA Report also concealed that Parris Relatives 1 and
2 were relatives of an Adoption Agency employee. .

64, On or about August 10, 2016, PARRIS contacted a counselor for a social services
agency who resided in Texas and was experienced in intercountry adoption (âAdoption
Counselorâ) and told her that Child 2 required counseling. On or about August 12, 2016, Parris
Relative 1 informed Adoption Counselor that Child 2 had been injured. Adoption Counselor told
Parris Relative 1 that Child 2 must be taken for a medical exam before the counseling program

could begin.

19
ease: Liz0-cr-00424-S0 Doc #1 Flled: 08/15/20 20 of 44. PageiD #20

   

65. Adoption Counselor discovered that Child 2 had been placed into the home of Parris
Relatives 1 and 2 before they had completed a home study. Adoption Counselor was concerned
that PARRIS had not fully informed Adoption Counselor about the amount of time that Child 2
had been living in Parris Relative | and 2âs home.

66. On or about August 12, 2016, Adoption Counselor 1 reported Adoption Agencyâs
actions related to Child 2 to the Council on Accreditation.

67. Child 2 was taken to Cook Childrenâs Hospital in Ft. Worth, Texas. Medical staff
identified significant injuries in several areas of Child 2âs body. Child 2âs case was referred to the
Texas Department of Family and Protective Services, which removed Child 2 from Parris Relative
1 and 2âs home. Child 2âs case was also referred to the Denton Police Department.

68. In or around late August 2016, the Denton Police Department informed Poland
Client that Child 2 had been injured. At around that same time, COLE contacted Poland Client.
COLE expressed concern to Poland Client that Adoption Agency would no longer be able to
complete adoptions in Poland because of the events concerning Child 2.

69. On or about September 2, 2016, COLE submitted another report to the Council on
Accreditation regarding the injury to Child 2 (the âSeptember 2016 COA Reportâ). In the report,
COLE wrote of Parris Relatives | and 2, â[t]he family in question is not a[n] [Adoption Agency]
family.â COLE again concealed in the September 2016 COA Report that Parris Relatives 1 and 2
were related to PARRIS, and also concealed that Adoption Agency facilitated the transfer of Child
2 to them.

70, On or about December 9, 2016, COLE received an email from the Polish Central
Authority informing her that it had suspended Adoption Agencyâs accreditation in Poland. It had

done so because of what it had learned about the treatment of Child 2.

71. Also on or about December 9, 2016, Parris Relative 1 wrote an email to PARRIS
that falsely stated, â[We] were just temporary guardians of there [sic] four year old child from
Poland until they decided what they wanted to do with the child until February 2016â. PARRIS
ââ knowing that Parris Relatives | and 2 took custody of Child 2 in July 2015 with the intent to
permanently adopt the child â forwarded the false email to COLE.

72. On or about December 11, 2016, COLE emailed a letter to the Polish Central
Authority (the âDecember 2016 Letterâ), In the December 2016 Letter, COLE made false
representations and concealed material facts in an attempt to get Adoption Agency reinstated in
Poland. In the December 2016 Letter, COLE, among other things: (1) falsely stated that Poland
Client transferred Child 2 to Parris Relatives 1 and 2 in July 2015 for temporary care although
Poland Client had repeatedly told COLE that she intended to transfer Child 2 to Parris Relatives 1
and 2 permanently; (2) concealed from the Polish Central Authority that Parris Relatives 1 and 2 |
were, as COLE knew, relatives of an Adoption Agency employee; and (3) concealed the role of
herself, PARRIS, and Co-Conspirator 1 in arranging the transfer of Child 2 to Parris Relatives 1
and 2.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Monday, August 17, 2020

Three Individuals Charged with Arranging Adoptions from Uganda and Poland Through Bribery
and Fraud

Three women were charged in a 13-count indictment filed on Aug. 14 in the Northern District of Ohio for their alleged roles in schemes to
corruptly and fraudulently procure adoptions of Ugandan and Polish children through bribing Ugandan officials and defrauding U.S. adoptive
parents, U.S. authorities, and a Polish regulatory authority.

Margaret Cole, 73, of Strongsville, Ohio, Debra Parris, 68, of Lake Dallas, Texas, and Dorah Mirembe, 41, of Kampala, Uganda, were charged in
the indictment. In relation to the Uganda scheme, Parris and Mirembe were each charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and commit visa fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and wire fraud, one count of conspiracy to
commit money laundering, three substantive FCPA counts and three substantive counts of money laundering. Parris was also charged with one
count of mail fraud. In relation to the Poland scheme, Parris and Cole were each charged with one count of conspiracy to defraud the United
States. Cole was further charged with one count of making a false statement to a U.S. accrediting entity and one count of making a false
statement to a Polish authority.

âThe defendants allegedly resorted to bribery and fraud to engage in an international criminal adoption scheme that took children from their
home countries in Uganda and Poland without properly determining whether they were actually orphaned. The defendants sought to profit from
their alleged criminal activity at the expense of families and vulnerable children,â said Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian C. Rabbitt of the
Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division. âThese charges clearly show that the Department of Justice is committed to protecting children
worldwide, including those involved in the international adoption process.â

âThese defendants are accused of orchestrating an alleged scheme that bribed Ugandan officials, defrauded the United States and manipulated
parents inside and outside of the country,â said U.S. Attorney Justin Herdman of the Northern District of Ohio. âAs a result of this alleged
conduct, prospective parents were deceived, hundreds of thousands of dollars were misused and innocent children were displaced from their
homes.â

âThese three defendants preyed on the emotions of parents, those wanting the best for their child, and those wishing to give what they thought
was an orphaned child a family to love,â said Special Agent in Charge Eric B. Smith of the FBIâs Cleveland Field Office. âThese defendants
allegedly lied to both sides of the adoption process, and bribed Ugandan officials who were responsible for the welfare of children. Parents,
prospective parents and children were emotionally vested and were heartbroken when they learned of the selfishness and greed in which these
three engaged. The FBI will never cease in its efforts to protect the innocent and unwitting from those who prey on that trust and confidence
and we will vigorously pursue and hold those responsible accountable.â

With respect to the Uganda scheme, the indictment alleges that Parris and Mirembe, together with others, engaged in a scheme to pay bribes
to Ugandan officials to corruptly procure the adoption of Ugandan children by families in the United States, including the adoption of children
who were not properly determined to be orphaned and who had to be ultimately returned to their birth parents.

Specifically, Parris, Mirembe, and their co-conspirators allegedly (1) paid bribes to social welfare officers in exchange for them issuing welfare
reports recommending that certain children be placed into orphanages without first ensuring that the children were actually orphaned or that
putting them up for adoption was in the childrenâs best interest; (2) paid bribes to Ugandan magistrate judges to obtain court orders placing
those children in an orphanage that was willing to accept the children without inquiring into whether they were actually orphans; (3) paid bribes
to court registrars to cause the court registrars to assign the cases of these children to two corrupt âadoption-friendlyâ judges; and (4) paid
bribes to the corrupt Ugandan judges to obtain orders to permit their clients to bring the children to the United States for adoption.

Parris, Mirembe, and others also allegedly lied to, and concealed material information from, adoptive parents, including lying about the bribe
payments and whether the children were properly determined to be eligible for adoption, and concealing other material information about the
childrenâs history. The indictment also alleges that Parris, Mirembe, and others agreed to cause false documents to be submitted to the U.S.
Department of State to hide the corrupt and fraudulent scheme and to mislead it in its adjudication of visa applications for the Ugandan children
being considered for adoption. The co-conspirators and the entities they worked for received more than $900,000 in connection with these
adoptions.

With respect to the Poland scheme, the indictment alleges that after clients of their adoption agency determined they could not care for one of
the two Polish children they were set to adopt, Cole and Parris took steps to transfer the child to Parrisâs relatives, who were not eligible for
intercountry adoption and one of whom had a criminal arrest record. After the child was physically abused, Cole and Parris took steps to
conceal their improper conduct from the entity responsible for accrediting U.S. intercountry adoption agenciesâand from the Polish authority
responsible for intercountry adoptionsâin an attempt to continue profiting from these adoptions.

An indictment is merely an allegation and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of
law.

Assistant United States Attorneys, and Defendant, Douglas Ray (âDefendantââ), and Defendantâs
counsel, pursuant fe Rule 11(c)(1)(B) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, state that they
have entered into an agreement, the terms and conditions of which are as follows:

The Defendantâs Agreement

1. Defendant agrees to plead guilty to Count One and Count Two of the Information.
Count One charges Defendant with conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, Title
15 United States Code, Section 78dd-2 (ââFCPAâ), in violation of Title 18, United States Code,

Punishment Range

2. The statutory maximum penalty for Count One, a violation of Title 18, United
States Code, Section 371, is a term of imprisonment of not more than five years and a fine of not
more than $250,000 or twice the pecuniary gain or loss from the crime. The statutory maximum
penalty for Count Two, a violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 371, is also a term of
imprisonment of not more than five years and a fine of not more than $250,000 or twice the
pecuniary gain or loss from the crime. Additionally, Defendant may receive a term of supervised
release after imprisonment of up to three years. See Title 18, United States Code, Sections
3571(b)(3), 3571(d), and 3583(b)(2). Defendant acknowledges and understands that if he should
violate the conditions of any period of supervised release which may be imposed as part of his
sentence, then Defendant may be imprisoned for the entire term of supervised release, without
credit for time already served on the term of supervised release prior to such violation. See Title
18, United States Code, Section 3583(e)(3). Defendant understands that he cannot have the
imposition or execution of the sentence suspended, nor is he eligible for parole.

Mandatory Special Assessment

3, Pursuant to Title 18, United States Code, Section 3013(a)(2)(A), immediately after
sentencing, Defendant will pay to the Clerk of the United States District Court a special assessment
in the amount of one hundred dollars ($100.00) per count of conviction.

Immigration Consequences

4, Defendant recognizes that pleading guilty may have consequences with respect to
his immigration status if he is not a citizen of the United States. Defendant understands that if he
is not a citizen of the United States, by pleading guilty he may be removed from the United States,

denied citizenship, and denied admission to the United States in the future. Defendantâs attorney

 
Mase 4:16-cr-00409 Documents? Filecdin TXSD on 1O/28/16 Page Satis

has advised Defendant of the potential immigration consequences resulting from Defendantâs plea
of guilty.
Cooperation

5. The parties understand this Agreement carries the potential for a motion for
departure under Section 5K1.1 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines (âSentencing
Guidelinesâ). Defendant understands and agrees that whether such a motion is filed will be
determined solely by the United States through the United States Attorney for the Southern District
of Texas and the Fraud Section. Should Defendantâs cooperation, in the sole judgment and
discretion of the United States, amount to âsubstantial assistance,â the United States reserves the
sole right to file a motion for departure pursuant to Section 5K1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines.
Defendant further agrees to persist in that plea through sentencing, and fully cooperate with the
United States. Defendant understands and agrees that the United States will request that sentencing
be deferred until that cooperation is complete.

6. Defendant understands and agrees that the usage âfully cooperate,â as used herein,
includes providing all information relating to any criminal activity known to Defendant, including,
but not limited to, violations of the FCPA, wire fraud, and money laundering. Defendant
understands that such information includes both state and federal offenses arising therefrom. In
that regard:

(a) Defendant agrees that this Plea Agreement binds only the United States
Attorney for the Southern District of Texas, and the United States
Department of Justice, Criminal Division, Fraud Section, and Defendant,
and that it does not bind any other United States Attorney or other
component or unit of the Department of Justice;

(b) Defendant agrees to testify truthfully as a witness before a grand jury or in
any other judicial or administrative proceeding when called upon to do so

by the United States. Defendant further agrees to waive his Fifth
Amendment privilege against self-incrimination for the purpose of this

 

 
Case 416-cr-00409 Documents? Filedin TXSD on 1/25/16 Page 4 of 18

Agreement;

(c) Defendant agrees to voluntarily attend any interviews and conferences as
the United States may request;

(d) Defendant agrees to provide truthful, complete, and accurate information
and testimony and understands any false statements made by Defendant to
the grand jury or at any court proceeding (criminal or civil), or to a
government agent or attorney, can and will be prosecuted under the
appropriate perjury, false statement, or obstruction statutes;

(e) Defendant agrees to provide to the United States all documents in his
possession or under his control relating to all areas of inquiry and
investigation; and -

(f) Should the recommended departure, if _any, not meet Defendantâs
expectations, Defendant understands he remains bound by the terms of this
Agreement and that he cannot, for that reason alone, withdraw his plea.

Waiver of Appeal

7, Defendant is aware that Title 28, United States Code, Section 1291, and Title 18,
United States Code, Section 3742, afford a defendant the right to appeal the conviction and
sentence imposed. Defendant knowingly and voluntarily waives the right to appeal the conviction
and the sentence imposed, or the manner in which the sentence was determined, except Defendant
may appeal a sentence above the statutory maximum penalty for the offenses charged in Count
One and Count Two of the Information. Additionally, Defendant is aware that Title 28, United
States Code, Section 2255, affords the right to contest or âcollaterally attackâ a conviction or
sentence after the conviction or sentence has become final. Defendant knowingly and voluntarily
waives the right to contest his conviction or sentence by means of any post-conviction proceeding,
except that Defendant does not waive the right to raise a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel
on direct appeal, if otherwise permitted, or on collateral review in a motion under Title 28, United

States Code, Section 2255. In the event the Defendant files a notice of appeal following the

imposition of the sentence, the United States will assert its rights under this agreement and seek

 
Case 416-cr-00409 Documents? Filedin TXSD on 1/25/16 Page 5 of 18

specific performance of this waiver.

8. In agreeing to these waivers, Defendant is aware that a sentence has not yet been
determined by the Court. Defendant is also aware that any estimate of the possible sentencing
range under the Sentencing Guidelines that he may have received from his counsel, the United
States, or the Probation Office, is a prediction, not a promise, and such estimate did not induce
his guilty plea and is binding on neither the United States, the Probation Office, nor the Court.
The United States does not make any promise or representation concerning what sentence
Defendant will receive. Defendant further understands and agrees that the Sentencing Guidelines
are âeffectively advisoryâ to the Court. United States v. Booker, 125 S.Ct. 738 (2005).
Accordingly, Defendant understands that, although the Court must consult the Sentencing
Guidelines and must take them into account when sentencing Defendant, the Court is not bound
to follow the Sentencing Guidelines nor sentence Defendant within the calculated guideline range.

9. Defendant understands and agrees that each and all waivers contained in the
Agreement are made in exchange for the concessions made by the United States in this Plea
Agreement.

The United Statesâ Agreements

10. The United States agrees to each of the following:

(a) At the time of sentencing, the United States agrees not to oppose
Defendantâs anticipated request to the Court and the United States Probation
Office that he receive a two-level downward adjustment under Section
3El.1(a) of the Sentencing Guidelines should Defendant accept
responsibility as contemplated by the Sentencing Guidelines; and

(b) If Defendant qualifies for an adjustment under U.S.S.G. Section 3E1.1(a)
and Defendantâs offense level is 16 or greater, the United States may move
for an additional one-level downward adjustment based on the timeliness of

the plea or the expeditious manner in which Defendant provided complete
information regarding his role in the offense.

 
Mase 4:16-cr-00409 Documents? Filecdin TXSD on 1/28/16 Page Gaf18

Agreement Binding Only Southern District of Texas and
U.S. Department of Justice, Criminal Division, Fraud Section

11. The United States agrees that it will not further criminally prosecute Defendant in
the Southern District of Texas for offenses arising from conduct charged in the Information. This
Plea Agreement binds only the United States Attorneyâs Office for the Southern District of Texas;
the United States Department of Justice, Criminal Division, Fraud Section; and Defendant. It does
not bind any other United States Attorney or any other component or unit of the Department of
Justice. The United States will bring this Plea Agreement and the full extent of Defendantâs
cooperation to the attention of other prosecuting offices if requested.

United Statesâ Non-Waiver of Appeal

12. The United States reserves the right to carry out its responsibilities under the
Sentencing Guidelines. Specifically, the United States reserves the right to:

(a) Bring its version of the facts of this case, including its evidence file and
any investigative files, to the attention of the Probation Office in
connection with that officeâs preparation of a presentence report;

(b) Set forth or dispute sentencing factors or facts material to sentencing;

(c) Seek resolution of such factors or facts in conference with Defendantâs
counsel and the Probation Office;

(d) File a pleading relating to these issues, in accordance with U.S.S.G.
Section 6A1.2 and Title 18, United States Code, Section 3553(a); and

(e) Appeal the sentence imposed or the manner in which it was determined.
Sentence Determination
13. Defendant is aware that the sentence will be imposed after consideration of the
Sentencing Guidelines, which are only advisory, as well as the provisions of Title 18, United States
Code, Section 3553(a). Defendant nonetheless acknowledges and agrees that the Court has

authority to impose any sentence up to and including the statutory maximum set for the offense(s)

 
Mase 4:16-cr-00409 Documents? Filecdin TXSD on 1/28/16 Page 7 otis

to which Defendant pleads guilty, and that the sentence to be imposed is within the sole discretion
of the sentencing judge after the Court has consulted the applicable Sentencing Guidelines.
Defendant understands and agrees the partiesâ positions regarding the application of the
Sentencing Guidelines do not bind the Court, and that the sentence imposed is within the discretion
of the sentencing judge. If the Court should impose any sentence up to the maximum established
by statute, or should the Court order any or all of the sentences imposed to run consecutively,
Defendant cannot, for that reason alone, withdraw a guilty plea, and will remain bound to fulfill
all of the obligations under this Plea Agreement.
Waiver of Rights

14. Defendant represents to the Court that he is satisfied that his attorney has rendered
effective assistance. Defendant understands that by entering into this Agreement, he surrenders
certain rights as provided in this Plea Agreement. Defendant understands that those rights include
the following:

(a) Defendant understands that he has the right to have the facts of this case
presented to a federal grand jury, consisting of between sixteen and twenty-
three citizens, twelve of whom would have to find probable cause to believe
that he committed the offense set forth in the information before an
indictment could be returned. Defendant acknowledges that he is
knowingly and intelligently waiving his right to be indicted.

(b) If Defendant persisted in a plea of not guilty to the charges, Defendant
would have the right to a speedy jury trial with the assistance of counsel.
The trial may be conducted by a judge sitting without a jury if Defendant,
the United States, and the court all agree.

a) Ata trial, the United States would be required to present witnesses and other
evidence against Defendant. Defendant would have the opportunity to
confront those witnesses and his attorney would be allowed to cross-
examine them. In turn, Defendant could, but would not be required to,
present witnesses and other evidence on his own behalf. If the witnesses

for Defendant would not appear voluntarily, he could require their
attendance through the subpoena power of the court.

 
Mase 4:16-cr-00409 Documents? Filecdin TXSD on 1/28/16 Page Batis

(d)  Atatrial, Defendant could rely on a privilege against self-incrimination and
decline to testify, and no inference of guilt could be drawn from such refusal
to testify. However, if Defendant desired to do so, he could testify on his
own behalf.

Factual Basis for Guilty Plea

15. Defendant is pleading guilty because he is guilty of the charges contained in Count
One and Count Two of the Information. If this case were to proceed to trial, the United States
could prove each element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. The following facts, among
others, would be offered to establish Defendantâs guilt:

âForeign State Government |â was the government of one of the thirty-one states that
comprise Mexico.

âForeign Official 1â was an employee of Foreign State Government | with responsibility
for maintaining Foreign State Government 1âs aircraft from at least in or around 2005 to in or
around December 2010.

âForeign State Government 2â was the government of one of the thirty-one states that
comprise Mexico.

âForeign Official 2â was an employee of Foreign State Government 2 with responsibility
for maintaining Foreign State Government 2âs aircraft from at least in or around 2005 through at
least in or around 2010.

âForeign State Government 3â was the government of one of the thirty-one states that
comprise Mexico.

âForeign Official 3â was an employee of Foreign State Government 3 with responsibility

Case 416-cr-00409 Documents? Fiedin TXSD on 1/25/16 Page Sof is

âForeign State Government 4â was the government of one of the thirty-one states that
comprise Mexico.

âForeign Official 4â was an employee of Foreign State Government 4 with responsibility
for maintaining Foreign State Government 4âs aircraft from at least in or around 2005 through at
least in or around 2013.

âForeign Law Enforcementâ was a federal law enforcement organization of Mexico.

âForeign Official 5,â âForeign Official 6,â and âForeign Official 7â were employees of

âAviation Corporation Aâ was a United States company, headquartered in Houston, Texas,
which provided maintenance, repair, overhaul, and related services to customers in the United
States and Mexico, including to Foreign State Government 1, Foreign State Government 2, Foreign
State Government 3, Foreign State Government 4, Foreign Law Enforcement, and others.

The defendant, DOUGLAS RAY (âdefendant RAYâ) was a citizen of the United States
and a resident of Texas. Defendant RAY was the President of Aviation Corporation A and an
owner of Aviation Corporation A from at least in or around 2002 through at least in or around May
2016.

âCo-Conspirator 1â was a citizen of Mexico. Co-Conspirator | was an agent of Aviation
Corporation A from at least in or around 2006 through at least in or around May 2016. Co-
Conspirator | met with defendant RAY in the United States and received corrupt payments from
Aviation Corporation A into bank accounts in the United States.

The Conspiracy to violate the FCPA

From at least in or around 2006 through in or around March 2016, defendant RAY and

 
Case 416-cr-00409 Documenta? Filed in TXSD on TO/S8/16 Page 10 of 18

others, known and unknown, including Co-Conspirator 1, knowingly, willfully, and corruptly
agreed to make payments, and caused Aviation Corporation A to make payments, to foreign
officials (the âForeign Officialsâ), including Foreign Official 1, Foreign Official 2, Foreign
Official 3, Foreign Official 4, Foreign Official 5, Foreign Official 6, Foreign Official 7, and others,
to influence the Foreign Officials in their official capacity and to secure an improper advantage
for Aviation Corporation A in order to assist Aviation Corporation A in obtaining and retaining
business with Foreign State Government 1, Foreign State Government 2, Foreign State
Government 3, Foreign State Government 4, Foreign Law Enforcement, and other foreign
governments, agencies, and instrumentalities thereof (the âForeign Governments and
Instrumentalitiesââ).

In furtherance of the bribe scheme, defendant RAY communicated with others, including
Co-Conspirator | and the Foreign Officials, about the bribes, and defendant RAY, together with
others, caused bribe payments to be made to the Foreign Officials that were deposited into bank
accounts in Texas and elsewhere. Defendant RAY, Co-Conspirator 1, and others also caused
corrupt payments to be made into Co-Conspirator 1âs bank accounts in the United States and
caused bribe payments to be made in cash in Mexico. For example, defendant RAY and others
caused Aviation Corporation A to make: (i) a corrupt payment in the amount of approximately
$155,000 from Aviation Corporation Aâs bank account in Texas in or around December 15, 2010
to Foreign Official 1âs bank account in Texas, (ii) a corrupt payment in the amount of
approximately $10,000 from Aviation Corporation Aâs bank account in Texas in or around June
11, 2009 to Foreign Official 2, (iii) a corrupt payment in the amount of approximately $3,299 from
Aviation Corporation Aâs bank account in Texas in or around June 29, 2011 to Foreign Official 3,

(iv) a corrupt payment in the amount of approximately $9,748 from Aviation Corporation Aâs bank

10

 
Case &16-cr-00409 Documenta? Filed in TXSD on TO/S8/16 Page Li of is

account in Texas in or around March 12, 2009 to Foreign Official 4, and (v) a corrupt payment in
the amount of approximately $19,754 from Aviation Corporation Aâs bank account in Texas in or
around February 29, 2012 to Co-Conspirator 1.

Defendant RAY knew it was wrong to make the payments, and knew that the purpose of
the corrupt payments was to influence the Foreign Officials in their official capacity in order to
improperly secure business with the Foreign Governments and Instrumentalities. F urther,
defendant RAY and others took steps to conceal the bribe scheme, including by hiding the amount
of the bribe payments in invoices sent to the Foreign Governments and Instrumentalities.

From at least in or around 2006 through in or around March 2016, defendant RAY and
others knowingly, willfully, and corruptly conspired and agreed to cause Aviation Corporation A
to make bribe payments to the Foreign Officials totaling more than $1,500,000 in association with
the bribe scheme.

The Conspiracy to commit Wire Fraud

From at least in or around 2006 through in or around March 2016, defendant RAY and
others, known and unknown, including Co-Conspirator 1, knowingly, willfully, and intentionally
agreed to devise, and did devise, a scheme and artifice to defraud privately owned entities in the
United States and in Mexico to obtain money from those entities by means of materially false and
fraudulent pretenses and representations and did knowingly transmit, and cause to be transmitted,
wire communications in interstate commerce for the purpose of executing the scheme.

Defendant RAY and other co-conspirators, including Co-Conspirator 1, agreed that
Aviation Corporation A would pay bribes and kickbacks to employees, agents, and representatives
of privately owned entities, and agreed they would conceal material facts from those entities in

connection with the bribery and kickback schemes.

1]

 
Case &16-cr-00409 Documenta? Filed in TXSD on TO/S8/16 Page 12 of 18

In furtherance of the scheme, among other things: (i) defendant RAY and his co-
conspirators discussed the-corrupt payment of bribes and kickbacks to employees, agents, and
representatives in person and through other means, including on the telephone and through
electronic mail; (ii) defendant RAY and his co-conspirators knowingly and intentionally caused
Aviation Corporation A to send invoices from the Southern District of Texas to privately owned
entities located in the United States and Mexico that hid the cost of bribe and kickback payments
promised to employees, agents, and representatives of those entities within Aviation Corporation
Aâs pricing; and (iii) defendant RAY and his co-conspirators knowingly and intentionally caused
privately owned entities located in the United States and Mexico to make wire payments from
bank accounts located in the United States and Mexico to the bank account of Aviation Corporation
A for goods and services procured as a result of the scheme to defraud. For example, on or about
May 23, 2011 and on or about February 10, 2014, defendant RAY and others caused Aviation
Corporation A to send invoices from the Southern District of Texas to a privately owned entity in
Mexico that were inflated and hid the cost of bribe and kickback payments promised to an
employee of the entity.

Breach of Plea Agreement

16. If Defendant should fail in any way to fulfill completely all of the obligations under
this Plea Agreement, the United States âwill be released from its obligations under the Plea
Agreement, and Defendantâs plea and sentence will stand. If at any time Defendant retains,
conceals or disposes of assets in violation of this Plea Agreement, or if Defendant knowingly
withholds evidence or is otherwise not completely truthful with the United States, then the United
States may move the Court to set aside the guilty plea and reinstate prosecution. Any information

and documents that have been disclosed by Defendant, whether prior to or subsequent to this Plea

12

 
Case &16-cr-00409 Documenta? Filed in TXSD on TO/S8/16 Page 13 of 18

Agreement, and all leads derived therefrom, will be used against Defendant in any prosecution.
Restitution, Forfeiture, and Fines â Generally

17. This Plea Agreement is being entered into by the United States on the basis of
Defendantâs express representation that he will make a full and complete disclosure of all assets
over which he exercises direct or indirect control, or in which he has any financial interest.
Defendant agrees not to dispose of any assets or take any action that would effect a transfer of
property in which he has an interest, unless Defendant obtains the prior written permission of the
United States.

18. Defendant agrees to make a complete financial disclosure by truthfully executing a
sworn financial statement (Form OBD-500 or similar form) within 14 days of signing this plea
agreement. Defendant agrees to authorize the release of all financial information requested by the
United States, including, but not limited to, executing authorization forms permitting the United
States to obtain tax information, bank account records, credit histories, and social security
information. Defendant agrees to discuss and answer any questions by the United States relating

21. Defendant stipulates and agrees that the factual basis for his guilty plea supports
the forfeiture of proceeds that resulted from the conspiracies to which Defendant is pleading guilty,
and Defendant agrees to the imposition of a personal money judgment against him and in favor of

pay. Ifthe Court imposes a money judgment, Defendant agrees to forfeit any of his property, or
his interest in property, up to the value of any unpaid portion of the money judgment, until the
money judgment is fully satisfied. Defendant stipulates and admits that one or more of the
conditions set forth in Title 21, United States Code, Section 853(p), exists.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Tuesday, December 27, 2016

Four Businessmen and Two Foreign Officials Plead Guilty in Connection with Bribes Paid to
Mexican Aviation Officials

Charges were unsealed against six individuals, all of whom have pleaded guilty for their involvement in schemes to bribe Mexican officials in
order to secure aircraft maintenance and repair contracts with government-owned and controlled entities, and two for conspiring to launder the
proceeds of the schemes.

Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Kenneth Magidson of the Southern
District of Texas, Special Agent in Charge Mark Dawson of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcementâs Homeland Security Investigations (ICE-
HSI) in Houston, Special Agent in Charge Shane Folden of ICE-HSI in San Antonio and Special Agent in Charge Rick Goss of Internal Revenue
Service-Criminal Investigationâs (IRS-Cl) Houston Field Office made the announcement.

âThe six convictions announced today demonstrate the departmentâs commitment to holding accountable those who further official corruption
through bribery,â said Assistant Attorney General Caldwell. âThese convictions are the result of a coordinated effort by prosecutors and agents
who built the cases brick by brick using traditional law enforcement techniques.â

âHSI special agents and our law enforcement partners will continue to aggressively investigate financial crimes committed by corrupt foreign
officials,â said Special Agent in Charge Folden. âThis case serves as a reminder that HSI will use all its resources to identify, investigate and
dismantle these criminal networks wherever they operate.â

âThe individuals involved in this scheme paid millions of dollars in bribes to foreign officials in exchange for aviation contracts that placed
legitimate businesses at a significant competitive disadvantage,â said Special Agent in Charge Goss. âIRS-Clâs role in unraveling this scheme
assisted in facilitating the guilty pleas that were announced today.â

Douglas Ray, 55, of Magnolia, Texas, and Victor Hugo Valdez Pinon, 54, a citizen of Mexico, pleaded guilty on Oct. 28 and Oct. 26, 2016,
respectively, before U.S. District Judge Alfred H. Bennett of the Southern District of Texas to conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act (FCPA) and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Kamta Ramnarine, 69, and Daniel Perez, 69, both of Brownsville, Texas, both pleaded guilty on
Nov. 2, 2016, before U.S. District Judge Ricardo H. Hinojosa of the Southern District of Texas to one count of conspiring to violate the FCPA.
Ramnarine and Perez are scheduled to be sentenced on Jan. 30, 2017. Ray and Valdez Pinon are scheduled to be sentenced Feb. 23, 2016.

Ernesto Hernandez Montemayor, 55, and Ramiro Ascencio Nevarez, 58, both of whom are citizens of Mexico and were previous officials of
Mexican state government entities, each pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. Hernandez Montemayor
pleaded guilty before Judge Bennett on Dec. 9, 2015, and is scheduled to be sentenced on Jan. 12, 2017. Nevarez pleaded guilty before Judge
Hinojosa on March 4, 2016, and was sentenced to 15 months in prison on May 27, 2016.

According to the defendantsâ plea agreements, between 2006 and 2016, Ray conspired with Valdez and others to bribe Mexican officials. The
defendants and their co-conspirators, who owned or were associated with companies in the United States that provided aircraft maintenance,
repair, overhaul and related services to customers from the United States and Mexico, paid the bribes in order to secure parts and servicing
contracts with Mexican government-owned customers. Ray agreed to pay bribes to at least seven different foreign officials, including
Hernandez Montemayor, sometimes paying the bribes via wire transfer and checks to accounts in the United States controlled by the officials.
As part of his guilty plea, Hernandez Montemayor admitted that while employed by a Mexican state government, he accepted bribes from Ray,
Ramnarine, Perez and others in exchange for taking certain actions to assist companies they owned in winning business with Hernandez
Montemayorâs state government employer. Hernandez Montemayor also admitted that he conspired with Ray, Ramnarine, Perez and others to
launder the proceeds of the bribery scheme.

Ramnarine and Perez admitted that, in addition to bribing Hernandez Montemayor, they also conspired to pay bribes to several other foreign
officials between 2007 and 2015 to ensure that their Brownsville-based company won aircraft parts and services contracts with Mexican
government-owned customers. As part of his guilty plea, Nevarez admitted that while employed by a Mexican public university, he accepted
bribes from Ramnarine and Perez in exchange for taking certain actions to assist their company in winning business with the university.
Nevarez also admitted that he conspired with Ramnarine, Perez and others to launder the proceeds of the bribery scheme.

In total, Ray, Valdez Pinon, Ramnarine, Perez and their co-conspirators paid more than $2 million in bribes to Mexican officials, including
Hernandez Montemayor and Nevarez, in order to secure aviation maintenance, repair and overhaul contracts.

ICE-HSI and IRS-CI are investigating the case. Trial Attorneys Christopher Cestaro and Kevin R. Gingras of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section
and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jesse Salazar and Arthur Jones of the Southern District of Texas are prosecuting the case. The Criminal Division's
Office of International Affairs also provided significant assistance.

The Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the

departmentâs FCPA enforcement efforts can be found at www. justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.

$100 special assessment.

âTt is further understood that the Defendant shall make restitution in an amount to be
. specified by. the Court in accordance with 18 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 3663, 3663A, and 3664. This amount shall
be paid according to a plan established by the Court. ety

The Defendant furthermore admits the forfeiture allegations with respect to Count One of

the Indictment and agrees to forfeit to the United States, pursuant to pursuant to 18 U.S.C.

Â§ 981(a)(1)(C) and Title 28 U.S.C. Â§ 2461, all property, real and personal, that constitutes or is

derived from proceeds traceable to the commission of the offense (the âMoney Judgmentâ). It is

. further understood that any forfeiture of the Defendantâs assets shall not be treated as satisfaction

of any fine, restitution, cost of imprisonment, or any other penalty the Court may impose upon him
in addition to forfeiture.

In addition, at the time of sentencing, the Government will move to dismiss any open
Count(s) against the Defendant. The Defendant agrees that with respect to any and all dismissed
charges he is not a âprevailing partyâ within the meaning of the âHyde Amendment,â Section 617,

violate any provision of this Agreement, Reichert shall thereafter be subject to prosecution for any

plead guilty because he is in fact guilty. By entering this plea of guilty, the defendant waives any
~ and all right to withdraw his plea or to attack his conviction, either on direct appeal or collaterally,

material, exculpatory material pursuant to Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), other than
information establishing the factual innocence of the Defendant, or impeachment material pursuant
to Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150 (1972), that has not already been produced as of the date

. The Defendant recognizes that, if he is not a citizen of the United States, his guilty plea
and conviction make it very likely that his deportation from the United States is presumptively
mandatory and that, at a minimum, he is at risk of being deported or suffering other adverse
immigration consequences. The Defendant acknowledges that he has discussed the possible
immigration consequences (including deportation) of his guilty plea and conviction with defense
counsel. The Defendant affirms that he wants to plead guilty regardless of any immigration
consequences that may result from the guilty plea and conviction, even if those consequences
_ include deportation from the United States. It is agreed that the Defendant will have no right to
withdraw his guilty plea based on any actual or perceived adverse immigration consequences
(including deportation) resulting from the guilty plea and conviction. It is further agreed that the
Defendant will not challenge his conviction or sentence on direct appeal, or through litigation
under Title 28, United States Code, Section 2255 and/or Section 2241, on the basis of any actual
or perceived adverse immigration consequences (including deportation) resulting from his guilty
plea and conviction.

This Agreement supersedes any prior understandings, promises, or conditions between the
Offices and the Defendant. No additional understandings, promises, or conditions have been

Former Siemens Executive Pleads Guilty To Role in $100 Million Foreign Bribery Scheme

The former Technical Manager of the Major Projects division of Siemens Business Services GmbH & Co. OGH (SBS), a wholly owned subsidiary of
Siemens Aktiengesellschaft (Siemens AG), pleaded guilty today to conspiring to pay tens of millions of dollars in bribes to Argentine government
officials to secure, implement and enforce a $1 billion contract to create national identity cards.

Acting Assistant Attorney General John P. Cronan of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman of the
Southern District of New York and Assistant Director in Charge Andrew W. Vale of the FBIâs Washington, D.C. Field Office made the
announcement.

Eberhard Reichert, 78, of Munich, Germany, was employed by Siemens AG from 1964 until 2001. Beginning in approximately 1990, Reichert
was the Technical Manager of the Major Projects division of SBS. Reichert pleaded guilty today in the Southern District of New York to one count
of conspiring to violate the anti-bribery, internal controls and books and records provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and to
commit wire fraud. Reichert was arraigned last December on a three-count indictment filed in December 2011 charging him and seven other
individuals. He will be sentenced by U.S. District Judge Denise L. Cote of the Southern District of New York, who accepted his plea today.

âFar too often, companies pay bribes as part of their business plan, upsetting what should be a level playing field and harming companies that
play by the rules,â said Acting Assistant Attorney General Cronan. âIn this case, one of the largest public companies in the world paid
staggeringly large bribes to officials at the uppermost levels of the government of Argentina to secure a billion-dollar contract. Eberhard
Reichertâs conviction demonstrates the Criminal Divisionâs commitment to bringing both companies and corrupt individuals to justice, wherever
they may reside and regardless of how long they may attempt to avoid arrest.â

âEberhard Reichert tried to sidestep laws designed to root corruption out of the government contracting process,â said U.S. Attorney Berman.
âAs he admitted in Manhattan federal court today, Reichert helped to conceal tens of millions of dollars in bribes that were paid to unfairly
secure a lucrative contract from the Argentine government. Todayâs plea should be a warning to others that our office is committed to bringing
corrupt criminals to justice, no matter how long they run from the law.â

In 1998, the government of Argentina awarded to a subsidiary of Siemens AG a contract worth approximately $1 billion to create state-of-the-
art national identity cards (the Documento Nacional de Identidad or DNI project). The Argentine government terminated the DNI project in
2001. In connection with his guilty plea, Reichert admitted that he engaged in a decade-long scheme to pay tens of millions of dollars in bribes
to Argentine government officials in connection with the DNI project, which was worth more than $1 billion to Siemens. Reichert admitted that
he and his co-conspirators concealed the illicit payments through various means, including using shell companies associated with
intermediaries to disguise and launder the funds.

Reichert also admitted that he used a $27 million contract between a Siemens entity and a company called MFast Consulting AG that purported
to be for consulting services to conceal bribes to Argentine officials.

In 2008, Siemens AG, a German entity, pleaded guilty to violating the books and records provisions of the FCPA; Siemens Argentina pleaded
guilty to conspiracy to violate the books and records provisions of the FCPA; and Siemens Bangladesh Limited and Siemens S.A. - Venezuela
each pleaded guilty to conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery and books and records provisions of the FCPA. As part of the plea agreements, the
Siemens companies paid a total of $450 million in criminal fines. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also brought a civil case
against Siemens AG alleging that it violated the anti-bribery, books and records and internal controls provisions of the FCPA. In resolving the
SEC case, Siemens AG paid $350 million in disgorgement of wrongful profits. The Munich Public Prosecutorâs Office also resolved similar
charges with Siemens AG that resulted in a fine of $800 million. In August 2009, following these corporate resolutions with U.S. and German
authorities, Siemens AG withdrew its claim to the more than $200 million arbitration award.

The FBI's International Corruption Squad in Washington, D.C. is investigating the case. The case is being prosecuted by Trial Attorney Michael
Culhane Harper of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Niketh Velamoor of the Southern District of New York. The
Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs, the SEC, Croatian authorities and the Munich Public Prosecutor's Office also provided
significant assistance.

The Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice

Departmentâs FCPA enforcement efforts can be found at www. justice. gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.

The United States of America charges that:

GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

At all times relevant to this Information:

1, PetrÃ©leos de Venezuela S.A. (âPDVSAâ) was the state-owned and state-controlled
oil company in Venezuela. PDVSA was responsible for the exploration, production, refining,
transportation, and trade in energy resources in Venezuela and provided funding for other
operations of the Venezuelan government.

2. PDVSA entered into various joint ventures with foreign oil companies to leverage
the expertise of those oil companies (the âPDVSA Subsidiariesâ or, individually, a âPDVSA
Subsidiaryâ). PDVSA maintained a majority stake in, and largely controlled, the PDVSA
Subsidiaries and that control extended to the procurement process.

3. Petrocedefio S.A. (âPetrocedefioâ) was a PDVSA Subsidiary that consisted of a

combination of PDVSA and two European oil companies, with majority control belonging to

 
CG

ase :19-cr-2O725-MGC Document S Entered om FLOOD Docket 11/04/2019 Page 2 offs

PDVSA. Petrocedefio had a significant operating budget and awarded several hundred million
dollars in procurement contracts each year.

4. PDVSA and the PDVSA_ Subsidiaries, including Petrocedefio, were
âinstrumentalitiesâ of the Venezuelan government as that term is used in the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act (âFCPAâ), Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2(h)(2)(A).

5. Defendant EDOARDO ORSONI was a Venezuelan citizen residing in Venezuela
until late 2017. Orsoni held various positions at PDVSA and the PDVSA Subsidiaries from 2007
to 2017, including, among others, general counsel of Petrocedefio, legal manager for all PDVSA
operations in the oil-rich Orinoco belt, and general counsel of PDVSA. Beginning in or around
2012, ORSONI served on a committee that reviewed and approved Petrocedefio contracts.
ORSONI was a âforeign officialâ as that term is used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code,
Section 78dd-2(h)(2).

6. Contractor 1, an individual whose identity is known to the United States, owned or
controlled several companies, including Florida-registered companies, that supplied goods or
services to PDVSA and PDVSA Subsidiaries. Contractor 1 was an officer, director, employee,
and agent of a âdomestic concern,â and a stockholder acting on behalf of a âdomestic concern,â as
those terms are used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2(h)(1).

CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT MONEY LAUNDERING

Beginning in or around 2012, and continuing through at least 2016, in the Southern District

of Florida, and elsewhere, the defendant,

EDOARDO ORSONI,
CG

ase 1:19-cr-20725-MGC Documents Entered on FLSD Docket DVO4/2019 Page 2 arg

did knowingly and willfully, that is, with the intent to further the objects of the conspiracy,
combine, conspire, confederate, and agree with others known and unknown to the United States,
including Contractor 1, to commit offenses against the United States, namely:

a. to knowingly conduct a financial transaction, which involved the proceeds of
specified unlawful activity, knowing the property involved in the financial transaction represented
the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity, and knowing that the transaction was designed in
whole and in part to conceal and disguise the nature, the location, the source, the ownership, and
the control of the proceeds of said specified unlawful activity, in violation of Title 18, United
States Code, Section 1956(a)(1)(B)(@); and

b. to knowingly transport, transmit, and transfer a monetary instrument and funds
from a place in the United States to and through a place outside the United States and to a place in
the United States from and through a place outside the United States with the intent to promote the
carrying on of specified unlawful activity, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section
1956(a)(2)(A).

It is further alleged that the specified unlawful activity is the following: (a) bribery of a
foreign official, a felony violation of the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2, and
(b) offenses against a foreign nation, specifically Venezuela, involving bribery of a public official,
as provided by Title 18, United States Code, Section 1956(c)(7)(B)(v).

PURPOSE OF THE CONSPIRACY

1, The purpose of the conspiracy was for EDOARDO ORSONI and other co-

conspirator contractors (including Contractor 1) to engage in financial transactions that concealed,

disguised, and promoted bribe payments made for the benefit of ORSONTI, all in an effort by the
Case iDo-cr-20725-MGC Document3 Entered on FLSD Docket 11/O4/2019 Page 4 ofS

co-conspirators (including Contractor 1) to gain an illegal and improper advantage in obtaining
and retaining procurement contracts with PDVSA and the PDVSA Subsidiaries.
MANNER AND MEANS OF THE CONSPIRACY

The manner and means by which EDOARDO ORSONI and his co-conspirators sought to
accomplish the objects and purpose of the conspiracy included, among other things, the following,
while in the Southern District of Florida and elsewhere:

2. EDOARDO ORSONI received instructions from senior PDVSA officials to
ensure that specific contractors received contracts from Petrocedefio, which ultimately yielded
benefits for these senior PDVSA officials.

3. EDOARDO ORSONI agreed to receive bribes from co-conspirator contractors
(including Contractor 1) in exchange for ORSONIâs assistance in obtaining contracts with or
recelving payments from Petrocedefio and another PDVSA Subsidiary.

4. EDOARDO ORSONI and the co-conspirator contractors (including Contractor 1)
agreed to conceal, and did in fact conceal, the nature, source, and ownership of the bribes by
directing that bribe payments be made to corporate bank accounts connected to ORSONI but not
in his name.

5. EDOARDO ORSONI and a co-conspirator whose identity is known to the United
States used proceeds of the bribes sent by co-conspirator contractors, including Contractor 1, to
conduct personal financial transactions for themselves, including the purchase of real estate in

South Florida.

THE PENALTIES Approved: DMP Fâ Gp

 

This offense carries a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment and a $250,000
fine. In addition, under 18 U.S.C. Â§ 3583, the Court may impose a term of supervised
release of not more than 3 years to begin at the expiration of any term of imprisonment.
The defendant understands that, should he violate any condition of the supervised release,
he may be required to serve a further term of imprisonment of up to 2 years per violation,
with no credit for time already spent on supervised release.

The defendant also is subject to the alternative fine provision of 18 U.S.C. Â§ 3571.
Under this section, the maximum fine that may be imposed on the defendant is the greatest of the
following amounts: (1) twice the gross gain to the defendant resulting from the offense; (2) twice
the gross loss resulting from the offense; or (3) $250,000,

In addition, the defendant is obligated by 18 U.S.C. Â§ 3013 to pay a special assessment of
$100 on each count of conviction. The defendant agrees to pay the special assessment to the
Clerk of the Court on the day the guilty plea is accepted.

Unless otherwise ordered, should the Court impose a fine of more than $2,500 as part of
the sentence, interest will be charged on the unpaid balance of the fine or restitution not paid
within 15 days after the judgment date. 18 U.S.C. Â§ 3612(f). Other penalties and fines may be
assessed on the unpaid balance of a fine or restitution pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Â§ 3572 (h), (4) and Â§

The defendant understands that the Court is required to consider any applicable
Sentencing Guidelines as well as other factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. Â§ 3553(a) to tailor an
appropriate sentence in this case and is not bound by this plea agreement. The defendant agrees
that the Sentencing Guideline determinations will be made by the Court, by a preponderance of
the evidence, based upon input from the defendant, the Government, and the United States
Probation Office, The defendant further understands that he has no right to withdraw his guilty
plea if his sentence or the Guideline application is other than he anticipated, including if the
sentence is outside any of the ranges set forth in this agreement.

April 2 2015 Letter to Thomas A. Hanusik, Esq.
Page 3 of 8

Acceptance of Responsibility

At this time, the Government agrees to recommend that the Court reduce by two levels
the defendantâs adjusted offense level under Â§ 3E1.1(a) of the Sentencing Guidelines, based on
the defendantâs prompt recognition and affirmative acceptance of personal responsibility for the
offense. Moreover, should the defendant qualify for a decrease under Â§ 3E1.1(a) and his offense
level determined prior to the operation of subsection (a) is level 16 or greater, the Government
will file a motion with the Court pursuant to Â§ 3E1.1(b) which recommends that the Court
reduce the defendantâs Adjusted Offense Level by one additional level based on his prompt
notification of his intention to enter a plea of guilty. The defendant expressly understands that
the Court is not obligated to accept the Governmentâs recommendations on the reductions.

The above-listed recommendations are conditioned upon the defendantâs affirmative
demonstration of acceptance of responsibility, by (1) truthfully admitting the conduct
comprising the offense(s) of conviction and truthfully admitting or not falsely denying any
additional relevant conduct for which the defendant is accountable under Sentencing Guideline Â§
1B1.3; and (2) truthfully disclosing to the Probation Office personal information requested,
including the submission of a complete and truthful financial statement detailing the defendantâs
financial condition.

In addition, the Government expressly reserves the right to seek denial of the adjustment
for acceptance of responsibility if the defendant engages in any acts, unknown to the
Government at the time of the signing of this agreement, which (1) indicate that the defendant
has not terminated or withdrawn from criminal conduct or associations (Sentencing Guideline Â§
3E1.1); (2) could provide a basis for an adjustment for obstructing or impeding the
administration of justice (Sentencing Guideline Â§ 3C1.1); or (3) constitute a violation of any
condition of release. Moreover, the Government reserves the right to seek denial of the
adjustment for acceptance of responsibility if the defendant seeks to withdraw his plea of guilty
or takes a position at sentencing, or otherwise, which, in the Governmentâs assessment, is
inconsistent with affirmative acceptance of personal responsibility. The defendant understands
that he may not withdraw his plea of guilty if, for the reasons explained above, the Government
does not make one or both of the recommendations or seeks denial of the adjustment for
acceptance of responsibility.

Guideline Stipulation

The parties agree that the applicable Sentencing Guidelines range exceeds the statutory
maximum sentence of five years imprisonment. Therefore, pursuant to U.S.S.G. Section
5G1.1, the applicable guideline sentence is five years imprisonment.

The defendant agrees that he will neither move for a downward departure, nor will he
seek a variance from the applicable Guideline sentence pursuant to the factors in Title 18,
United States Code, Section 3553(a), except with respect to personal history or personal
characteristics unrelated to the charged conduct. Nor will the defendant suggest that the
Case 3:19-cr-00181-JBA Document6 Filed 07/10/19 Page 4 of 8

April 2 2015 Letter to Thomas A, Hanusik, Esq.
Page 40f 8

Probation Department consider a downward departure or adjustment or suggest that the Court
sua sponte consider a downward departure, except with respect to personal history or personal
characteristics unrelated to the charged conduct.

The defendant expressly understands that the Court is not bound by this agreement on
the Guideline ranges specified above. The defendant further understands that he will not be
permitted to withdraw the plea of guilty if the Court imposes a sentence outside any of the ranges
set forth in this agreement.

In the event the Probation Office or the Court contemplates any sentencing calculations
different from those stipulated by the parties, the parties reserve the right to respond to any
inquiries and make appropriate legal] arguments regarding the proposed alternate calculations.
Moreover, the Government expressly reserves the right to defend any sentencing
determination, even if it differs from that stipulated by the parties, in any post-sentencing
proceeding.

Waiver of Right to Appeal or Collaterally Attack Conviction and Sentence

The defendant acknowledges that under certain circumstances he is entitled to challenge
his conviction and sentence. The defendant agrees not to appeal or collaterally attack his
conviction in any proceeding, including but not limited to a motion under 28 U.S.C. Â§ 2255
and/or Â§ 2241, Nor will he pursue such an appeal or collateral attack to challenge the sentence
imposed by the Court if that sentence does not exceed 5 years in prison, a 3-year term of
supervised release, a $100 special assessment, and a fine of $250,000, even if the Court imposes
such a sentence based on an analysis different from that specified above. The Government and
the defendant agree that this waiver applies regardless of whether the term of imprisonment is
imposed to run consecutively to or concurrently with, in whole or in part, the undischarged
portion of any other sentence that has been imposed on the defendant at the time of sentencing in
this case. The defendant acknowledges that he is knowingly and intelligently waiving these
rights. Furthermore, the parties agree that any challenge to the defendantâs sentence that is not
foreclosed by this provision will be limited to that portion of the sentencing calculation that is
inconsistent with (or not addressed by) this waiver. Nothing in the foregoing waiver of appellate
and collateral review rights shall preclude the defendant from raising a claim of ineffective
assistance of counsel in an appropriate forum.

Information to the Court

The Government reserves its right to address the Court with respect to an
appropriate sentence to be imposed in this case. Moreover, the Government will discuss the
facts of this case, including information regarding the defendantâs background and
character, 18 U.S.C. Â§ 3661, with the United States Probation Office and will provide the
Probation Officer with access to material in its file, with the exception of grand jury
material.

April 2 2015 Letter to Thomas A. Hanusik, Esq.
Page 5 of 8

WAIVER OF RIGHTS

Waiver of Right to Indictment

â The defendant understands that he has the right to have the facts of this case presented to
a federal grand jury, consisting of between sixteen and twenty-three citizens, twelve of whom
would have to find probable cause to believe that he committed the offense set forth in the
information before an indictment could be returned. The defendant acknowledges that he is
knowingly and intelligently waiving his right to be indicted,

Waiver of Trial Rights and Consequences of Guilty Plea

The defendant understands that he has the right to be represented by an attorney at
every stage of the proceeding and, if necessary, one will be appointed to represent him.

The defendant understands that he has the right to plead not guilty or to persist in that
plea if it has already been made, the right to a public trial, the right to be tried by a jury with the
assistance of counsel, the right to confront and cross-examine the witnesses against him, the
right not to be compelled to incriminate himself, and the right to compulsory process for the
attendance of witnesses to testify in his defense. The defendant understands that by pleading
guilty he waives and gives up those rights and that, if the plea of guilty is accepted by the Court,
there will not be a further trial of any kind.

The defendant understands that, if he pleads guilty, the Court may ask him questions
about each offense to which he pleads guilty, and if he answers those questions falsely
under oath, on the record, and in the presence of counsel, his answers may later be used
against him in a prosecution for perjury or making false statements.

Waiver of Statute of Limitations

The defendant agrees that, should the conviction following defendantâs plea of guilty
pursuant to this plea agreement be vacated for any reason, then any prosecution that is not time-
barred by the applicable statute of imitations on the date of the signing of this plea agreement
(including any indictment or counts the Government has agreed to dismiss at sentencing
pursuant to this plea agreement) may be commenced or reinstated against defendant,
notwithstanding the expiration of the statute of limitations between the signing of this plea
agreement and the commencement or reinstatement of such prosecution. The defendant agrees
to waive all defenses based on the statute of limitations with respect to any prosecution that is
not time-barred on the date the plea agreement is signed.

Waiver of Challenge to Plea Based on Immigration Consequences

The defendant understands that pleading guilty may have consequences with respect to
his immigration status if he is not a citizen of the United States. Under federal law, a broad
range of crimes are removable offenses, including the offense(s) to which the defendant is
Case 3:19-cr-00181-JBA Document6 Filed 07/10/19 Page 6 of 8

April 2 2015 Letter to Thomas A. Hanusik, Esq.
Page 6 of 8

pleading guilty. Removal and other immigration consequences are the subject of a separate
proceeding, however, and the defendant understands that no one, including his attorney or the
district court, can predict to a certainty the effect of his conviction on his immigration status.
The defendant nevertheless affirms that he wants to plead guilty regardless of any immigration
consequences that his plea may entail, even if the consequence is automatic removal from the
United States.

The defendant understands that he is bound by his guilty plea regardless of the
immigration consequences of the plea and regardless of any advice the defendant has received
from his counsel or others regarding those consequences. Accordingly, the defendant waives
any and all challenges to his guilty plea and to his sentence based on those consequences, and
agrees not to seek to withdraw his guilty plea, or to file a direct appeal or any kind of collateral
attack challenging his guilty plea, conviction or sentence, based on the immigration
consequences of his guilty plea, conviction and sentence.

ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF GUILT AND VOLUNTARINESS OF PLEA

The defendant acknowledges that he is entering into this agreement and is pleading
guilty freely and voluntarily because he is guilty. The defendant further acknowledges that he is
entering into this agreement without reliance upon any discussions between the Government and
him (other than those described in the plea agreement letter), without promise of benefit of any
kind (other than the concessions contained in the plea agreement letter), and without threats,
force, intimidation, or coercion of any kind. The defendant further acknowledges his
understanding of the nature of the offense to which he is pleading guilty, including the penalties
provided by law. The defendant also acknowledges his complete satisfaction with the
representation and advice received from his undersigned attorney. The defendant and his
undersigned counsel are unaware of any conflict of interest concerning counselâs representation
of the defendant in the case.

SCOPE OF THE AGREEMENT

The defendant acknowledges that this agreement is limited to the undersigned parties
and cannot bind any other federal authority, or any state or local authority. The defendant
acknowledges that no representations have been made to him with respect to any civil or
administrative consequences that may result from this plea of guilty because such matters are
solely within the province and discretion of the specific administrative or governmental entity
involved, Finally, the defendant acknowledges that this agreement has been reached without
regard to any civil tax matters that may be pending or which may arise involving him.

COLLATERAL CONSEQUENCES

The defendant further understands that he will be adjudicated guilty of each offense to
which he has pleaded guilty and will be deprived of certain rights, such as the right to vote, to
hold public office, to serve on a jury, or to possess firearms. Further, the defendant
understands that if he is not a citizen of the United States, a plea of guilty may result in

 
Case 3:19-cr-00181-JBA Document6 Filed 07/10/19 Page 7 of 8

April 2 2015 Letter to Thomas A. Hanusik, Esq.
Page 7 of 8

removal from the United States, denial of citizenship, and denial of admission to the United
States in the future. The defendant understands that pursuant to section 203(b) of the Justice

For All Act, the Bureau of Prisons or the Probation Office will collect a DNA sample from the

defendant for analysis and indexing. Finally, the defendant understands that the Government

reserves the right to notify any state or federal agency by which he is licensed, or with which

he does business, as well as any current or future employer of the fact of his conviction.

SATISFACTION OF FEDERAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY; BREACH

The defendantâs guilty plea, if accepted by the Court, will satisfy the federal criminal
liability of the defendant in the District of Connecticut as a result of his participation in the
conduct which forms the basis of the one-count information in this case. The Government
further agrees not to prosecute the defendant for other instances, currently known to the
Government, of conspiring to make or making corrupt payments to foreign officials in
connection with power-related contracts obtained by or on behalf of Alstom S.A. or any of
its subsidiaries, for creating or maintaining, or causing the creation or maintenance of, false
books and records associated with any such contracts or payments, for the circumvention of
internal controls in connection with any such contracts or payments, or money laundering in
connection with any such contracts or payments. |

The defendant understands that if, before sentencing, he violates any term or condition of
this agreement, engages in any criminal activity, or fails to appear for sentencing, the
Government may void all or part of this agreement, If the agreement is voided in whole or in
part, the defendant will not be permitted to withdraw his plea of guilty.

Moreover, in the event the defendant withdraws from this agreement prior to pleading
guilty to the charge identified above, or otherwise fails to fully comply with any of the terms of
this plea agreement, the Government will be released from its obligations under this agreement,
and the defendant agrees and understands that: (a) he thereby waives any protection afforded by
the proffer letter agreements between the parties, Section 1B1.8 of the Sentencing Guidelines,
Rule 11(f) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, and Rule 410 of the Federal Rules of
Evidence, and that any statements made or document provided by him as part of his cooperation
with the Department, or otherwise, whether such statements were made or whether such
documents were provided prior to or after the execution of this agreement, will be admissible
against him without any limitation in any civil or criminal proceeding brought by the
Government; (b) the defendantâs waiver of any defense based on the statute of limitations or any
other defense based on the passage of time in filing an indictment or information, referred to
herein, shall remain in ful] force and effect; and (c) the defendant stipulates to the admissibility
and authenticity, in any case brought by the United States in any way related to the facts
referred to in this agreement, of any documents provided by the defendant or his representatives
to any state or federal agency,

Case Po Ta-cr-20276-FAM Bocurent9 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/13/2018 Page i of 11

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA

CASE NO. 18-20276-CR-MORENO

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
V.
EGBERT YVAN F. KOOLMAN,

Defendant.

PLEA AGREEMENT

The United States Department of Justice, Criminal Division, Fraud Section and the United
States Attorneyâs Office for the Southern District of Florida (collectively, the âGovernmentâ) and
EGBERT YVAN FERDINAND KOOLMAN (hereinafter referred to as the âdefendantâ) enter
into the following agreement:

l. The defendant understands that he has the right to have the evidence and charges
against him presented to a federal grand jury for determination of whether there is probable
cause to believe he committed the offense for which he is charged. Understanding that right,
and after full and complete consultation with his counsel, the defendant agrees to waive in open
court his right to prosecution by indictment and agrees that the Government may proceed by way
of an information filed pursuant to Rule 7 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.

2. The defendant agrees to plead guilty to a single-count information, which charges
the defendant with conspiracy to commit money laundering, in violation of Title 18, United
States Code, Section 1956(h).

3. The defendant is aware that the sentence will be imposed by the Court after
considering the advisory Federal Sentencing Guidelines and Policy Statements (hereinafter

âSentencing Guidelinesâ). The defendant acknowledges and understands that the Court will

 
Case PTa-cr-20276-FAM Bocurment9 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/13/2018 Page 2 of 11

compute an advisory sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines and that the applicable guidelines

 

will be determined by the Court relying in part on the results of a pre-sentence investigation by
the Courtâs probation office, which investigation will commence after the guilty plea has been
entered. The defendant is also aware that, under certain circumstances, the Court may depart
from the advisory Sentencing Guidelines range that it has computed, and may raise or lower that
advisory sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines. The defendant is further aware and
understands that the Court is required to consider the advisory guideline range determined under
the Sentencing Guidelines, but is not bound to impose a sentence within that advisory range; the
Court is permitted to tailor the ultimate sentence in light of other statutory concerns, and such
sentence may be either more severe or less severe than the Sentencing Guidelinesâ advisory
range. Knowing these facts, the defendant understands and acknowledges that the Court has the
authority to impose any sentence within and up to the statutory maximum authorized by law for
the offense identified in paragraph 2 and that the defendant may not withdraw the plea solely as a
result of the sentence imposed.

4. The defendant also understands and acknowledges that the Court may impose a
statutory maximum term of imprisonment of up to 20 years, followed by a term of supervised
release of up to three years. In addition to a term of imprisonment and supervised release, the
Court may impose a fine of up to $500,000 or not more than twice the value of the property
involved in the offense set forth in paragraph 2 above, and the Court may also order forfeiture
and restitution.

5. The defendant further understands and acknowledges that, in addition to any

sentence imposed under paragraph 4 of this agreement, a special assessment in the amount of

 
Case D8-cr-20276-FAM Bocument9 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/13/2018 Page 3 of 11

CAD

$100 will be imposed on the defendant. The defendant agrees that any special assessment

 

imposed shall be paid at the time of sentencing. If the defendant is financially unable to pay the
special assessment, the defendant agrees to present evidence to the Government and the Court at
the time of sentencing as to the reasons for the defendantâs failure to pay.

6. The Government reserves the right to inform the Court and the probation office of
all facts pertinent to the sentencing process, including all relevant information concerning the
offenses committed, whether charged or not, as well as concerning the defendant and the
defendantâs background. Subject only to the express terms of any agreed-upon sentencing
recommendations contained in this agreement, the Government further reserves the right to make |
any recommendation as to the quality and quantity of punishment.

7. The Government agrees that it will recommend at sentencing that the Court
reduce by two levels the Sentencing Guidelines level applicable to the defendantâs offense,
pursuant to Section 3E1.1(a) of the Sentencing Guidelines, based upon the defendants
recognition and affirmative and timely acceptance of personal responsibility. If, at the time of
sentencing the defendantâs offense level is determined to be 16 or greater, the Government will
file a motion requesting an additional one level decrease pursuant to Section 3E1.1(b) of the
Sentencing Guidelines, stating that the defendant has assisted authorities in the investigation or
prosecution of the defendantâs own misconduct by timely notifying authorities of the defendantâs
intention to enter a plea of guilty, thereby permitting the Government to avoid preparing for trial
and permitting the government and the Court to allocate their resources efficiently. The
Government, however, will not be required to make this motion and this recommendation if the

defendant: (a) fails or refuses to make a full, accurate and complete disclosure to the probation

 

 

 

 
@ d:]8-cr-20276-F AM Document Entered on FLSD Docket 04/13/2018 Page 4 of 14

office of the circumstances surrounding the relevant offense conduct; (b) is found to have
misrepresented facts to the Government prior to entering into this plea agreement; or (c) commits
any misconduct after entering into this plea agreement, including, but not limited to, committing
a state or federal offense, violating any term of release, or making false statements or
misrepresentations to any governmental entity or official.

8. The defendant agrees that he shall cooperate fully with the Government by: (a)
providing truthful and complete information and testimony, and producing documents, records
and other evidence, when called upon by the Government, whether in interviews, before a grand
Jury, or at any trial or other Court proceeding; (b) appearing at such grand jury proceedings,
hearings, trials, and other judicial proceedings, and at meetings, as may be required by the
Government; and (c) if requested by the Government, working in an undercover role under the
supervision of, and in compliance with, law enforcement officers and agents. In addition, the
defendant agrees that he will not protect any person or entity through false information or
omission, that he will not falsely implicate any person or entity, and that he that he will not
commit any further crimes.

9. The Government reserves the right to evaluate the nature and extent of the
defendantâs cooperation and to make that cooperation, or lack thereof, known to the Court at the
time of sentencing. If in the sole and unreviewable judgment of the Government, the
defendantâs cooperation is of such quality and significance to the investigation or prosecution of
other criminal matters as to warrant the Courtâs downward departure from the advisory
sentencing range calculated under the Sentencing Guidelines and/or any applicable minimum

mandatory sentence, the Government may make a motion prior to sentencing pursuant to Section

 
Case Pc Ta-cr-20276-FAM Bocurment9 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/13/2018 Page 5 of 11

5K1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines and/or Title 18, United States Code, Section 3553(e), or
subsequent to sentencing pursuant to Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure,
informing the Court that the defendant has provided substantial assistance and recommending
that the defendantâs sentence be reduced. The defendant understands and agrees, however, that
nothing in this agreement requires the Government to file any such motions, and that the
Governmentâs assessment of the quality and significance of the defendantâs cooperation shall be
binding as it relates to the appropriateness of the Governmentâs filing or non-filing of a motion to
reduce sentence.

10. The defendant understands and acknowledges that the Court is under no
obligation to grant a motion for reduction of sentence filed by the Government. In addition, the
defendant further understands and acknowledges that the Court is under no obligation of any
type to reduce the defendantâs sentence because of the defendantâs cooperation.

11. The Government and the defendant agree that, although not binding on the
probation office or the Court, they will jointly recommend that the Court make the following
findings and conclusions as to the sentence to be imposed:

a. Base Offense Level: The relevant base offense level under Sections
2S1.1(a)(2) and 2B1.1(b)(1) of the Sentencing Guidelines is 20.

b. Specific Offense Characteristics: The defendant should receive a two-level
increase under Section 2S 1.1(b)(2)(B) of the Sentencing Guidelines because the
offense involved violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1956.

c. Aggravating Role: The defendant should receive a four-level increase under

Section 3B1.1 because the defendant was an organizer or leader of a criminal

 
Case Po Ta-cr-20276-FAM Bocurment9 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/13/2018 Page 6 of 11

activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.

d. Abuse of Position of Trust: The defendant should receive a two-level increase
under Section 3B1.3 because the defendant abused a position of public or
private trust in a manner that significantly facilitated the commission or
concealment of the offense.

e. Adjusted Offense Level: The applicable adjusted offense level under all of the
circumstances of the offense committed by the defendant is 28.

12. The defendant agrees to forfeit to the United States voluntarily and immediately
all property, real or personal, which constitutes or is derived from proceeds traceable to the
violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1956(h) charged in the Information. The
defendant agrees to consent to the entry of orders of forfeiture for such property and for a money
judgment equal in value to the total amount of proceeds traceable to his offense of conviction.
The defendant admits and agrees that the conduct described in the Information and Factual
Proffer provides a sufficient factual and statutory basis for the forfeiture of the property sought
by the government.

13. | The defendant agrees to waive any appeal of the forfeiture. The defendant
waives the requirements of Rules 32.2 and 43(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure
regarding notice of the forfeiture in the Indictment or Information, announcement of the
forfeiture at sentencing, and incorporation of the forfeiture in the judgment. The defendant also
waives any failure by the Court to advise the defendant of any applicable forfeiture at the time
the guilty plea is accepted as required by Rule 11(b)(1)(J) of the Federal Rules of Criminal

Procedure. The defendant further agrees to waive any applicable time limits for the initiation of

 
ase T:T8-cr-20276-FAM DBocurnent9 Entered an FLSD Docket 04/13/2018 Page 7 of I

administrative or judicial forfeiture proceeding and/or further notification of any such forfeiture
brought against the property sought for forfeiture.

14, The defendant also agrees to assist the Government in all proceedings,
administrative or judicial, involving forfeiture to the United States of any property, including
substitute property, regardless of its nature or form, real or personal, which the defendant or
others known to the defendant, have accumulated as a result of illegal activities. The defendant
agrees that the United States shall, at its option, be entitled to forfeiture of any property
(substitute assets) of the defendant to satisfy the money judgment. The defendant further agrees
to take all steps necessary to locate property that could be used to satisfy the forfeiture money
judgment and to pass title to the United States before the defendantâs sentencing. To that end,
defendant agrees to fully assist the government in the recovery and return to the United States of
any assets, or portions thereof, wherever located. The assistance shall include: identification of
any property subject to forfeiture, agreement to the entry of an order enjoining the transfer or
encumbrance of such property, and the transfer of such property to the United States by delivery
to the Government, upon the Governmentâs request, any necessary and appropriate
documentation, including consents to forfeiture and quit claim deeds, to deliver good and
marketable title to such property. The defendant knowingly and voluntarily agrees to waive any
claim or defense the defendant may have under the Eighth Amendment to the United States
Constitution, including any claim of excessive fine or penalty with respect to the forfeited assets.

15. The defendant further understands that forfeiture is independent of any
assessments, fines, costs, restitution, or any other penalty that may be imposed by the Court.

The defendant knowingly and voluntarily waives any claim or defense he may have under the

 
Case Pc Ta-cr-20276-FAM Bocurent 9 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/13/2018 Page 8 of 11

Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution, including any claim of excessive fine or
penalty with respect to the forfeited property.

16. | The defendant agrees to make full and accurate disclosure of his financial affairs
to the Government, and expressly authorizes the Government to obtain a credit report. The
defendant agrees that within 10 calendar days and upon request of the Government, the
defendant shall submit a completed Financial Disclosure Statement (form provided by the United
States), and shall fully disclose and identify all assets in which he has any interest and/or over
which the defendant exercises control, directly or indirectly, including those held by a spouse,
nominee, or other third party.

17. The defendant agrees that restitution is mandatory pursuant to 18 U.S.C.
Â§3663A(c)(1)(A)(ii). The defendant agrees to the entry of a restitution order for the full amount
of victim losses, as determined by the Court.

18. The defendant is aware that Title 18, United States Code, Section 3742 and Title
28, United States Code, Section 1291 afford the defendant the right to appeal the sentence
imposed in this case. Acknowledging this, in exchange for the undertakings made by the
Government in this plea agreement, the defendant hereby waives all rights conferred by Sections
3742 and 1291 to appeal any sentence imposed, including any restitution order, or to appeal the
manner in which the sentence was imposed, unless the sentence exceeds the maximum permitted
by statute or is the result of an upward departure and/or an upward variance from the advisory
guideline range that the Court establishes at sentencing. The defendant further understands that
nothing in this agreement shail affect the Governmentâs right and/or duty to appeal as set forth in

Title 18, United States Code, Section 3742(b) and Title 28, United States Code, Section 1291.

 
Case iis-cr-20276-FAM Docurnent$ Entered on FLSD Docket O4/is/e018 Page 9 of 14

x

However, if the United States appeals the defendantâs sentence pursuant to Sections 3742(b) and
1291, the defendant shall be released from the above waiver of appellate rights. In addition to
the foregoing provisions, the defendant hereby waives all rights to argue on appeal that the
statute to which the defendant is pleading guilty is unconstitutional and that the admitted conduct
does not fall within the scope of the statute. By signing this agreement, the defendant
acknowledges that the defendant has discussed the appeal waiver set forth in this agreement with
the defendantâs attorney.

19. The defendant is aware that the sentence has not yet been determined by the
Court. The defendant also is aware that any estimate of the probable sentencing range or
sentence that the defendant may receive, whether that estimate comes from the defendantâs
attorney, the Government, or the probation office, is a prediction, not a promise, and is not
binding on the Government, the probation office, or the Court. The defendant understands
further that any recommendation that the Government makes to the Court as to sentencing,
whether pursuant to this agreement or otherwise, is not binding on the Court and the Court may
disregard the recommendation in its entirety. The defendant understands and acknowledges, as
previously acknowledged in paragraph 3 above, that the defendant may not withdraw his plea
based upon the Courtâs decision not to accept a sentencing recommendation made by the
defendant, the Government, or a recommendation made jointly by the defendant and the
Government.

20. The defendant recognizes that pleading guilty may have consequences with
respect to the defendantâs immigration status if the defendant is not a citizen of the United States.

Under federal law, a broad range of crimes are removable offenses, including the offense to

 
Case 1:i8-cr-20276-FAM Document Entered on FLSD Docket O4/1S/2018 Page LO of 12

which defendant is pleading guilty. Indeed, because the defendant is pleading guilty to a
conspiracy to launder money, removal is presumptively mandatory. Removal and other
immigration consequences are the subject of a separate proceeding, however, and the defendant
understands that no one, including the defendantâs attorney or the Court, can predict to a
certainty the effect of the defendantâs conviction on the defendantâs immigration status. The
defendant nevertheless affirms that the defendant wants to plead guilty regardless of any
immigration consequences that the defendantâs plea may entail, even if the consequences include
the defendantâs automatic removal from the United States, denial of citizenship, denial of
admission to the United States in the future, and denaturalization should the defendant obtain

citizenship.

10

 

 
Case 1:i8-cr-20276-FAM Document Entered on FLSD Docket O4/1S/2018 Page li of 14

22. This is the entire agreement and understanding between the Government and the

defendant. There are no other agreements, promises, representations, or understandings.

Aruban Telecommunications Purchasing Official Sentenced to Prison in Money Laundering
Conspiracy Involving Violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act

Conspirators Paid Over $1.3 Million to Influence the Official and to Secure Business with State-Owned
Telecommunications Company

An Aruban official residing in Florida was sentenced to 36 months in prison today for money laundering charges in connection with his role in a
scheme to arrange and receive corrupt payments to influence the awarding of contracts with an Aruban state-owned telecommunications
corporation.

Acting Assistant Attorney General John P. Cronan of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Benjamin G. Greenberg of the
Southern District of Florida and Assistant Special Agent in Charge Paul Keenan of the FBIâs Miami, Florida Field Office made the announcement.

Egbert Yvan Ferdinand Koolman, 49, a Dutch citizen residing in Miami, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Federico A. Moreno of the Southern
District of Florida, who also ordered Koolman to serve three years of supervised release following his prison sentence and to pay over $1.3
million in restitution. Koolman was an official of Servicio di Telecommunicacion di Aruba N.V. (Setar), an instrumentality of the Aruban
government. He pleaded guilty on April 13, before Judge Moreno to one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering.

According to admissions made as part of his plea agreement, between 2005 and 2016, Koolman operated a money laundering conspiracy from
his position as Setarâs product manager. Koolman admitted that, as part of the scheme, he conspired with Parker and others to transmit funds
from Florida and elsewhere in the United States to Aruba and Panama with the intent to promote a wire fraud scheme and a corrupt scheme
that violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). Koolman was promised and received bribes from individuals and companies located in
the United States and abroad in exchange for using his position at Setar to award lucrative mobile phone and accessory contracts. He received
the corrupt payments via wire transfer from banks located in the United States, in cash during meetings in Miami and in Aruba, and by
withdrawing cash in Aruba using a bank card that drew money from a U.S.-based bank account. In exchange for the more than $1.3 million in
corrupt payments that he received, Koolman also admittedly provided favored vendors with Setarâs confidential information.

In connection with the scheme, Lawrence W. Parker, Jr., 42, of Miami, pleaded guilty on Dec. 28, 2017 before U.S. District Judge Cecilia M.
Altonaga of the Southern District of Florida to one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA and to commit wire fraud. He was sentenced on April
30, to serve 35 months in prison and was ordered to pay $701,750 in restitution.

The FBI's International Corruption Unit in Miami is investigating the case. Trial Attorneys Jonathan Robell and Vanessa Snyder of the Criminal
Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Lois Foster-Steers of the Southern District of Florida are prosecuting the case. The Criminal
Divisionâs Office of International Affairs, as well as law enforcement colleagues in Aruba and Panama, provided significant assistance in this
matter.

The Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the departmentâs FCPA
enforcement efforts can be found at www. justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.

EGBERT YVAN F. KOOLMAN,

Defendant.

PLEA AGREEMENT

The United States Department of Justice, Criminal Division, Fraud Section and the United
States Attorneyâs Office for the Southern District of Florida (collectively, the âGovernmentâ) and
EGBERT YVAN FERDINAND KOOLMAN (hereinafter referred to as the âdefendantâ) enter
into the following agreement:

l. The defendant understands that he has the right to have the evidence and charges
against him presented to a federal grand jury for determination of whether there is probable
cause to believe he committed the offense for which he is charged. Understanding that right,
and after full and complete consultation with his counsel, the defendant agrees to waive in open
court his right to prosecution by indictment and agrees that the Government may proceed by way
of an information filed pursuant to Rule 7 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.

2. The defendant agrees to plead guilty to a single-count information, which charges
the defendant with conspiracy to commit money laundering, in violation of Title 18, United
States Code, Section 1956(h).

3. The defendant is aware that the sentence will be imposed by the Court after
considering the advisory Federal Sentencing Guidelines and Policy Statements (hereinafter

âSentencing Guidelinesâ). The defendant acknowledges and understands that the Court will

 
Case PTa-cr-20276-FAM Bocurment9 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/13/2018 Page 2 of 11

compute an advisory sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines and that the applicable guidelines

 

will be determined by the Court relying in part on the results of a pre-sentence investigation by
the Courtâs probation office, which investigation will commence after the guilty plea has been
entered. The defendant is also aware that, under certain circumstances, the Court may depart
from the advisory Sentencing Guidelines range that it has computed, and may raise or lower that
advisory sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines. The defendant is further aware and
understands that the Court is required to consider the advisory guideline range determined under
the Sentencing Guidelines, but is not bound to impose a sentence within that advisory range; the
Court is permitted to tailor the ultimate sentence in light of other statutory concerns, and such
sentence may be either more severe or less severe than the Sentencing Guidelinesâ advisory
range. Knowing these facts, the defendant understands and acknowledges that the Court has the
authority to impose any sentence within and up to the statutory maximum authorized by law for
the offense identified in paragraph 2 and that the defendant may not withdraw the plea solely as a
result of the sentence imposed.

4. The defendant also understands and acknowledges that the Court may impose a
statutory maximum term of imprisonment of up to 20 years, followed by a term of supervised
release of up to three years. In addition to a term of imprisonment and supervised release, the
Court may impose a fine of up to $500,000 or not more than twice the value of the property
involved in the offense set forth in paragraph 2 above, and the Court may also order forfeiture
and restitution.

5. The defendant further understands and acknowledges that, in addition to any

sentence imposed under paragraph 4 of this agreement, a special assessment in the amount of

 
Case D8-cr-20276-FAM Bocument9 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/13/2018 Page 3 of 11

CAD

$100 will be imposed on the defendant. The defendant agrees that any special assessment

 

imposed shall be paid at the time of sentencing. If the defendant is financially unable to pay the
special assessment, the defendant agrees to present evidence to the Government and the Court at
the time of sentencing as to the reasons for the defendantâs failure to pay.

6. The Government reserves the right to inform the Court and the probation office of
all facts pertinent to the sentencing process, including all relevant information concerning the
offenses committed, whether charged or not, as well as concerning the defendant and the
defendantâs background. Subject only to the express terms of any agreed-upon sentencing
recommendations contained in this agreement, the Government further reserves the right to make |
any recommendation as to the quality and quantity of punishment.

7. The Government agrees that it will recommend at sentencing that the Court
reduce by two levels the Sentencing Guidelines level applicable to the defendantâs offense,
pursuant to Section 3E1.1(a) of the Sentencing Guidelines, based upon the defendants
recognition and affirmative and timely acceptance of personal responsibility. If, at the time of
sentencing the defendantâs offense level is determined to be 16 or greater, the Government will
file a motion requesting an additional one level decrease pursuant to Section 3E1.1(b) of the
Sentencing Guidelines, stating that the defendant has assisted authorities in the investigation or
prosecution of the defendantâs own misconduct by timely notifying authorities of the defendantâs
intention to enter a plea of guilty, thereby permitting the Government to avoid preparing for trial
and permitting the government and the Court to allocate their resources efficiently. The

time of sentencing. If in the sole and unreviewable judgment of the Government, the
defendantâs cooperation is of such quality and significance to the investigation or prosecution of

mandatory sentence, the Government may make a motion prior to sentencing pursuant to Section

 
Case Pc Ta-cr-20276-FAM Bocurment9 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/13/2018 Page 5 of 11

5K1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines and/or Title 18, United States Code, Section 3553(e), or
subsequent to sentencing pursuant to Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure,
informing the Court that the defendant has provided substantial assistance and recommending
that the defendantâs sentence be reduced. The defendant understands and agrees, however, that
nothing in this agreement requires the Government to file any such motions, and that the
Governmentâs assessment of the quality and significance of the defendantâs cooperation shall be
binding as it relates to the appropriateness of the Governmentâs filing or non-filing of a motion to
reduce sentence.

10. The defendant understands and acknowledges that the Court is under no
obligation to grant a motion for reduction of sentence filed by the Government. In addition, the
defendant further understands and acknowledges that the Court is under no obligation of any
type to reduce the defendantâs sentence because of the defendantâs cooperation.

11. The Government and the defendant agree that, although not binding on the
probation office or the Court, they will jointly recommend that the Court make the following
findings and conclusions as to the sentence to be imposed:

a. Base Offense Level: The relevant base offense level under Sections
2S1.1(a)(2) and 2B1.1(b)(1) of the Sentencing Guidelines is 20.

b. Specific Offense Characteristics: The defendant should receive a two-level
increase under Section 2S 1.1(b)(2)(B) of the Sentencing Guidelines because the
offense involved violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1956.

c. Aggravating Role: The defendant should receive a four-level increase under

Section 3B1.1 because the defendant was an organizer or leader of a criminal

 
Case Po Ta-cr-20276-FAM Bocurment9 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/13/2018 Page 6 of 11

activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.

d. Abuse of Position of Trust: The defendant should receive a two-level increase
under Section 3B1.3 because the defendant abused a position of public or
private trust in a manner that significantly facilitated the commission or
concealment of the offense.

e. Adjusted Offense Level: The applicable adjusted offense level under all of the
circumstances of the offense committed by the defendant is 28.

12. The defendant agrees to forfeit to the United States voluntarily and immediately
all property, real or personal, which constitutes or is derived from proceeds traceable to the
violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1956(h) charged in the Information. The
defendant agrees to consent to the entry of orders of forfeiture for such property and for a money
judgment equal in value to the total amount of proceeds traceable to his offense of conviction.
The defendant admits and agrees that the conduct described in the Information and Factual
Proffer provides a sufficient factual and statutory basis for the forfeiture of the property sought
by the government.

13. | The defendant agrees to waive any appeal of the forfeiture. The defendant
waives the requirements of Rules 32.2 and 43(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure
regarding notice of the forfeiture in the Indictment or Information, announcement of the
forfeiture at sentencing, and incorporation of the forfeiture in the judgment. The defendant also
waives any failure by the Court to advise the defendant of any applicable forfeiture at the time
the guilty plea is accepted as required by Rule 11(b)(1)(J) of the Federal Rules of Criminal

Procedure. The defendant further agrees to waive any applicable time limits for the initiation of

 
ase T:T8-cr-20276-FAM DBocurnent9 Entered an FLSD Docket 04/13/2018 Page 7 of I

administrative or judicial forfeiture proceeding and/or further notification of any such forfeiture
brought against the property sought for forfeiture.

14, The defendant also agrees to assist the Government in all proceedings,
administrative or judicial, involving forfeiture to the United States of any property, including
substitute property, regardless of its nature or form, real or personal, which the defendant or
others known to the defendant, have accumulated as a result of illegal activities. The defendant
agrees that the United States shall, at its option, be entitled to forfeiture of any property
(substitute assets) of the defendant to satisfy the money judgment. The defendant further agrees
to take all steps necessary to locate property that could be used to satisfy the forfeiture money
judgment and to pass title to the United States before the defendantâs sentencing. To that end,
defendant agrees to fully assist the government in the recovery and return to the United States of
any assets, or portions thereof, wherever located. The assistance shall include: identification of
any property subject to forfeiture, agreement to the entry of an order enjoining the transfer or
encumbrance of such property, and the transfer of such property to the United States by delivery
to the Government, upon the Governmentâs request, any necessary and appropriate
documentation, including consents to forfeiture and quit claim deeds, to deliver good and
marketable title to such property. The defendant knowingly and voluntarily agrees to waive any
claim or defense the defendant may have under the Eighth Amendment to the United States
Constitution, including any claim of excessive fine or penalty with respect to the forfeited assets.

15. The defendant further understands that forfeiture is independent of any
assessments, fines, costs, restitution, or any other penalty that may be imposed by the Court.

The defendant knowingly and voluntarily waives any claim or defense he may have under the

 
Case Pc Ta-cr-20276-FAM Bocurent 9 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/13/2018 Page 8 of 11

Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution, including any claim of excessive fine or
penalty with respect to the forfeited property.

16. | The defendant agrees to make full and accurate disclosure of his financial affairs
to the Government, and expressly authorizes the Government to obtain a credit report. The
defendant agrees that within 10 calendar days and upon request of the Government, the
defendant shall submit a completed Financial Disclosure Statement (form provided by the United
States), and shall fully disclose and identify all assets in which he has any interest and/or over
which the defendant exercises control, directly or indirectly, including those held by a spouse,
nominee, or other third party.

17. The defendant agrees that restitution is mandatory pursuant to 18 U.S.C.
Â§3663A(c)(1)(A)(ii). The defendant agrees to the entry of a restitution order for the full amount
of victim losses, as determined by the Court.

18. The defendant is aware that Title 18, United States Code, Section 3742 and Title
28, United States Code, Section 1291 afford the defendant the right to appeal the sentence
imposed in this case. Acknowledging this, in exchange for the undertakings made by the
Government in this plea agreement, the defendant hereby waives all rights conferred by Sections
3742 and 1291 to appeal any sentence imposed, including any restitution order, or to appeal the
manner in which the sentence was imposed, unless the sentence exceeds the maximum permitted
by statute or is the result of an upward departure and/or an upward variance from the advisory
guideline range that the Court establishes at sentencing. The defendant further understands that
nothing in this agreement shail affect the Governmentâs right and/or duty to appeal as set forth in

Title 18, United States Code, Section 3742(b) and Title 28, United States Code, Section 1291.

 
Case iis-cr-20276-FAM Docurnent$ Entered on FLSD Docket O4/is/e018 Page 9 of 14

x

However, if the United States appeals the defendantâs sentence pursuant to Sections 3742(b) and
1291, the defendant shall be released from the above waiver of appellate rights. In addition to
the foregoing provisions, the defendant hereby waives all rights to argue on appeal that the
statute to which the defendant is pleading guilty is unconstitutional and that the admitted conduct
does not fall within the scope of the statute. By signing this agreement, the defendant
acknowledges that the defendant has discussed the appeal waiver set forth in this agreement with
the defendantâs attorney.

19. The defendant is aware that the sentence has not yet been determined by the
Court. The defendant also is aware that any estimate of the probable sentencing range or
sentence that the defendant may receive, whether that estimate comes from the defendantâs
attorney, the Government, or the probation office, is a prediction, not a promise, and is not
binding on the Government, the probation office, or the Court. The defendant understands
further that any recommendation that the Government makes to the Court as to sentencing,
whether pursuant to this agreement or otherwise, is not binding on the Court and the Court may
disregard the recommendation in its entirety. The defendant understands and acknowledges, as
previously acknowledged in paragraph 3 above, that the defendant may not withdraw his plea
based upon the Courtâs decision not to accept a sentencing recommendation made by the
defendant, the Government, or a recommendation made jointly by the defendant and the
Government.

20. The defendant recognizes that pleading guilty may have consequences with
respect to the defendantâs immigration status if the defendant is not a citizen of the United States.

Under federal law, a broad range of crimes are removable offenses, including the offense to

 
Case 1:i8-cr-20276-FAM Document Entered on FLSD Docket O4/1S/2018 Page LO of 12

which defendant is pleading guilty. Indeed, because the defendant is pleading guilty to a
conspiracy to launder money, removal is presumptively mandatory. Removal and other
immigration consequences are the subject of a separate proceeding, however, and the defendant
understands that no one, including the defendantâs attorney or the Court, can predict to a
certainty the effect of the defendantâs conviction on the defendantâs immigration status. The
defendant nevertheless affirms that the defendant wants to plead guilty regardless of any
immigration consequences that the defendantâs plea may entail, even if the consequences include
the defendantâs automatic removal from the United States, denial of citizenship, denial of
admission to the United States in the future, and denaturalization should the defendant obtain

citizenship.

10

22. This is the entire agreement and understanding between the Government and the

defendant. There are no other agreements, promises, representations, or understandings.

Aruban Telecommunications Purchasing Official Pleads Guilty to Money Laundering Conspiracy
Involving Violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act

Conspirators Paid Over $1.3 Million to Influence the Official and to Secure Business with State-Owned
Telecommunications Company

An Aruban official residing in Florida pleaded guilty today to money laundering charges in connection with his role in a scheme to arrange and
receive corrupt payments to influence the awarding of contracts with an Aruban state-owned telecommunications corporation.

Acting Assistant Attorney General John P. Cronan of the Department of Justiceâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Benjamin G. Greenberg of the
Southern District of Florida and Special Agent in Charge Robert F. Lasky of the FBIâs Miami Field Office made the announcement.

Egbert Yvan Ferdinand Koolman, 49, a Dutch citizen residing in Miami, Florida, was an official of Servicio di Telecommunicacion di Aruba N.V.
(Setar), an instrumentality of the Aruban government. Koolman pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Frederico A. Moreno of the Southern
District of Florida to one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. He is scheduled to be sentenced on June 27.

In connection with the scheme, Lawrence W. Parker, Jr., 42, of Miami, pleaded guilty on Dec. 28, 2017 to one count of conspiracy to violate the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and to commit wire fraud. Parkerâs sentencing is scheduled for April 30.

According to admissions made as part of his plea agreement, between 2005 and 2016, Koolman operated a money laundering conspiracy from
his position as Setarâs product manager. Koolman admitted that, as part of the scheme, he conspired with Parker and others to transmit funds
from Florida and elsewhere in the United States to Aruba and Panama with the intent to promote a wire fraud scheme and a corrupt scheme
that violated the FCPA. Koolman was promised and received bribes from individuals and companies located in the United States and abroad in
exchange for using his position at Setar to award lucrative mobile phone and accessory contracts, he admitted. He received the corrupt
payments via wire transfer from banks located in the United States, in cash during meetings in Miami and in Aruba, and by withdrawing cash in
Aruba using a bankcard that drew money from a United States-based bank account, he further admitted. In exchange for the more than $1.3
million in corrupt payments that he received, Koolman also admitted providing favored vendors with Setarâs confidential information.

The FBI's International Corruption Squads is investigating the case. Trial Attorneys Jonathan Robell and Vanessa Snyder of the Criminal
Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Lois Foster-Steers of the Southern District of Florida are prosecuting the case. The Criminal
Divisionâs Office of International Affairs also provided significant assistance.

The Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the
departmentâs FCPA enforcement efforts can be found at www. justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.

contracts for the power projects in Indonesia, including the Tarahan Project and Muara Tawar
Projects. The consultantsâ primary purpose was not to provide legitimate consulting services to
the Consortium but was instead to pay bribes to Indonesian officials who had the ability to
influence the award of the contracts.

23. The Consortium first retained Consultant A in connection with the Tarahan
Project in or around late 2002. Consultant A was to receive a commission from the Consortium
based on the overall value that each would receive from the Tarahan Project contract, from
which Consultant A was expected to pay bribes to Indonesian officials. However, through the
course of 2003, MOENAF, SULIANTO, KUSUNOKI, and other executives and employees of
the Consortium came to the conclusion that Consultant A was not effectively bribing key
Indonesian officials. Accordingly, in or around September or October 2003, MOENAF,
SULIANTO, KUSUNOKI, and other executives and employees of the Consortium informed
Consultant A that Consultant A would be responsible only for paying bribes to Official 1 and

that the Consortium would retain another consultant to pay bribes to PLN officials. Shortly

thereafter, the Consortium sent Consultant A amended consulting agreements, reducing the
Case 3:15-cr-00212-IBA Documents Filed Q2/26/15 Page 9 of 35

amount of Consultant Aâs commission to reflect Consultant Aâs reduced responsibilities.
Around the same time, the Consortium also retained Consultant B to bribe PLN officials in
connection with their efforts to secure the Tarahan Project contract and the Muara Tawar
Projects contracts.

24. The Consortium was ultimately awarded the Tarahan Project and Muara Tawar
Project contracts and made payments to Consultants A and B for the purpose of paying
Indonesian government officials, including Official 1, Official 2, Official 3, and Official 4, in
exchange for their assistance in awarding the Tarahan Project and the Muara Tawar Projects
contracts to the Consortium.

25. From in or around 2002, and continuing through in or around 2009, in the District
of Connecticut, and elsewhere, KUSUNOKI, MOENAF, and SULIANTO did willfully, that is,

the Rep. I spoke with Fred [Pierucci] right after he sent the note and we have concerns about 1)

comes from discussions from Marubeni....We would like to discuss with you on Friday evening
Jkt time.â

42. On or about September 4, 2002, MOENAF sent an e-mail to Rothschild, copying
Pierucci, in which MOENAF stated, â[W]e have met [Official 1] to confirm whether he is
comfortable with your suggested approach on Representation issue (through [Consultant
A])....Again, from my point of view whichever approach taken on the Representation issue,
must assure the coverage of Palembang [the city in Indonesia where the evaluation committee
was located]. You need to be confident that [Consultant A] could do this since he â being the
one who can make the âcommitmentâ â will have to take over the lead role from us in
Palembang.â

Case 223-cr-00212-IBA DBocumentS Filed 02/26/15 Page 15 of 35

certainly have an influence in PLN. He is not an agent but one of the players....[L]ooking in to
[Consultant Aâs] performance in Tarahan, we need to think twice prior taking him into
consideration..,.As the [Tarahan] project proceed, it shown that [Consultant A] has been unable
to fulfil his tasks and our expectation, he has no grip on PLN Tender team at all. Basically, his
function is more or less similar to cashier which I feel we pay too much....As you know, I have
set an appointment to meet [Official 2] tomorrow moming to find out who would be his
recommended agent, the one that PLN can really feel comfortable with.â

45. On or about December 3, 2002, Hoskins sent an e-mail to an executive at Alstom,

agreement with Consultant A, stating, â[Consultant A] sent me the completed âAgent Profileâ for
his very small company in Baltimore, Maryland, with branch office in Washington....1
understand, that the Tarahan job is boiler supply from the US to Indonesia. As I said before, it
would make more sens[e] to have an agent in Indonesia, where [Consultant Aâs] company has
obviously an office. As you know, we do not like to have a US domiciliated company as a
consultant, with payment in the US, and most probably in USD.â

48. On or about January 15, 2003, Hoskins responded to the e-mail referenced in

Paragraph 47 above, stating, âI talked to Reza [MOENAF] and his financial controller [] on this

subject to establish whether they could implement an agreement locally in Indonesia. They were

another upcoming power project with PLN (Labuan Angin), stating, âPLN people are upset with

are so much different.â

Case 223-cr-00212-IBA DBocumentS Filed Of/26/15 Page 17 of 35

THIS PROJECT!â

describing a meeting between two Alstom employees, two Marubeni employees, and two PLN
officials, including Official 4, regarding the Tarahan Project that stated, âPLN has expressed
their concerns over our âagentâ. They did not like the approach made by the agent. More

tly, they concern whether they can trust on the agent or not in regards to ârewardsâ issue.

    

They concern that if we have won the job, whether their rewards will still be satisfactory or this
agent only give them pocket money and disappear. Nothing has been shown by the agent that
the agent is willing to spend money.â (Emphasis in original).

E. Sulianto & [an Alstom Power US employee]. The subject of discussion was the increasingly
negative direction of the [Tarahan] projectâs evaluation and report to PLN board of
Dirctors...coupled with the recent information that the key ([Official 2]) to the projectâs success
is not pleased with our agentâs commitment and actions taken this far. Marubeni made clear
their position that the consortium should take immediate measures to terminate our agreement
with [Consultant A], negotiate and settlement and engage a new representative to tun the
situation around.â

58. On or about September 25, 2003, KUSUNOKI sent an e-mail to MOENAF,
SULIANTO, Pierucci, Pomponi, and another Alstom employee, copying other employees from
Marubeni, stating, âAs you can understand, unfortunately our agent almost did not execute his
function at all, so far. In case we donât take immediate action now now, we donât have any
chance to get this project forever. We shall not wait for coming of decision maker any more.

of the contract to one percent.

60. On or about September 30, 2003, MOENAF sent an e-mail to Hoskins, stating,
âEko [SULIANTO] also informed me there has been discussion between Fred [Pierucci],
Marubeni and [Consultant A] yesterday where [Consultant A] committed to convince [Official 1]
that âoneâ is enough.â

VAT) for our scope of work to you for the various services you are providing. The details of this
agreement will be formalized in a Service Agreement.â

62. In or around October 2003, MOENAF, SULIANTO, Hoskins, Pierucci, and other

the Tarahan Project reflecting the reduced commission rate of one percent.

63. On or about October 8, 2003, Consultant A sent an e-mail to Pierucci stating,

trading with [another official], the expenses are not coming from my contract but he has not
managed to talk to [Official 2] directly, in part because he does not want to address the issue
directly....Finally, I have not been able to get a contract out of Marubeni even though they keep
saying there is no problem. They also told [Official 2] that they do not have a firm commitment
to me yet and that has not sat well with [Official 1]. So please give them a nodge. Hopefully we

can sign both contracts at the same time.â

Monday we sent Tarahan CA [consultancy agreement] to [Consultant B], he immediately feel
cornered after reading the ToP [terms of payment] which said âprorataâ. When I talked to him on
the phone I said that I will look at it and I thought it should not be that bad. I then looked into

Tarahan ToP (see attached) and realise that the project payment is spread over 3.5 year! You

would understand why he is worry, he is willing to pre-finance his scope, fulfilling his

 
 

Case 2:23-cr-00212-IBA DocumentS Filed O2/26/15 Page 21 of 35

(and others) are slightly negative at the moment on Alstom support.â

71. On or about March 19, 2004, Consultant A sent an e-mail to Pierucci, stating, âI
am back from Indonesia. I have mentioned the following to Bill [Pomponi]. But it is important
that you also are aware of it. We need a very strong support from [Official 2] to counter
Mitsubishiâs lobbeying against us. I am not conviced that he is happy enough with us to provide
the support. [Official 1] is also unhappy because he thinks Alstom has not firmly indicated its
support for [Official 2]. Please verify that we have talked to [Official 2].â

Alstom. I have mentioned this in my earlier note to Lawrence [Hoskins]. But what would you
expect with 2-3%, and âprorateâ ToP [terms of payment]. He shook his head when he heard that
the ToP is spread in three and half year. Lets ask our self what have we done which showed our
commitment to him? Talking! that is what he said to me. Be aware [Official 2âs] reaction on
Tarahan is impacting Alstomâs other project [Muara Tawar] too.â

74, On or about March 22, 2004, Pomponi sent an e-mail to Hoskins, stating, âI have
seen your response and wish to offer the following as our compromise to [Consultant Bâs]
proposal: Instead of this could we suggest something like:

-40% at receipt by ALSTOM of the down payment
-Additional 40% at receipt by ALSTOM at month 12

follow suit. We are all agreed the terms are lousy but there is no choice. Reza [MOENAF] sees
[Official 2] tomorrow and needs to confirm this position. Can you give him the all clear today?â

78. On or about March 30, 2004, Pomponi sent an e-mail in response to the e-mail
from Hoskins described in Paragraph 77 above, stating, âApproval has just come regarding the

believe we have no choice. I will send a separate message to Reza [MOENAF], Eko
[SULIANTO], Kusunoki, and [another Marubeni employee] regarding the T/P to insure we get
[Consultant Bâs] signature and follow-up action with our friends. A note from you as well to
Kusunoki and [the other Marubeni employee] would be helpful given [Marubeniâs] thus far
objections to such âfront-endâ loading of payments.â

MOENAF, Hoskins, Pierucci, and another Marubeni employee, stating, âAs we discussed last
week by telephone, [Consultant B] is requiring 95% payment within the first 12 months of the
contract. I stated that this was a problem for ALSTOM however after speaking with Reza
Moenaf and Lawrence Hoskins, I am now convinced that this mode of payment is necessary for
the continuation of [Consultant Bâs] effectiveness....As mentioned by you last week, [Marubeni]

confirmed to follow ALSTOMâs actions and conclusions for the [Consultant B] Agreement.â

representative (agent), rather than 2 or 3. According to [Official 2] in Labuan Angin [Consultant

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Tuesday, February 18, 2020

Former Alstom Executives and Marubeni Executive Charged with Bribing Indonesian Officials

Two former executives of the Indonesian subsidiary of the French power and transportation company Alstom S.A. and a former executive of the
Japanese trading company Marubeni Corporation have been charged in a superseding indictment unsealed today for their alleged participation
in a scheme to pay bribes to foreign government officials in Indonesia.

Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney John H. Durham of the District of
Connecticut and Assistant Director in Charge Paul D. Delacout of the FBIâs Los Angeles Office made the announcement.

Reza Moenaf, 63, the former president of Alstomâs subsidiary in Indonesia; Eko Sulianto, 63, the former director of sales of Alstomâs subsidiary
in Indonesia; and Junji Kusunoki, 57, the former deputy general manager of Marubeniâs Overseas Power Project Department, were each charged
with conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and conspiracy to commit money laundering. Kusunoki was charged with six
counts of violating the FCPA and four counts of money laundering, and Sulianto and Moenaf were each charged with two counts of violating the
FCPA and one count of money laundering.

According to the indictment, the defendants, together with others, paid bribes to officials in Indonesia - including, among others, a high-ranking
member of the Indonesian Parliament and the president of Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN), the state-owned and state-controlled electricity
company in Indonesia - in exchange for assistance in securing a $118 million contract, known as the Tarahan project, for Alstomâs subsidiaries
in Connecticut and Indonesia and for Marubeni to provide power-related services for the citizens of Indonesia. To conceal the bribes, the
defendants allegedly retained two so-called âconsultantsâ purportedly to provide legitimate consulting services on behalf of the power company
and its subsidiaries in connection with the Tarahan project. The indictment, however, alleges that the primary purpose for hiring the
consultants was to use the consultants to pay bribes to Indonesian officials.

The first consultant retained by the defendants allegedly received hundreds of thousands of dollars in his Maryland bank account to be used to
bribe the member of Parliament. The consultant then allegedly transferred the bribe money to a bank account in Indonesia for the benefit of
the official. According to court documents, emails between the defendants and their co-conspirators discussed in detail the use of the first
consultant to funnel bribes to the member of Parliament and the influence that the member of Parliament could exert over the Tarahan project.

The superseding indictment alleges that in the fall of 2003, the defendants and their co-conspirators determined that the first consultant was
not effectively bribing key officials at PLN. One email between Moenaf, Sulianto and their co-conspirators described PLN officialsâ âconcern that
if we have won the job, whether their rewards will still be satisfactory or this agent only give them pocket money and disappear.â In another
email, Moenaf asserted that the consultant âhas no grip on the PLN Tender team at allâ and âis more or less similar to [a] cashier which | feel we
pay too much.â As a result, the co-conspirators allegedly retained a second consultant to more effectively bribe PLN officials. The defendants
and their co-conspirators were successful in securing the Tarahan project and subsequently made payments to the consultants for the alleged
purpose of bribing the Indonesian officials, the indictment alleges.

An indictment is merely an accusation, and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of
law.

The charges against Moenaf, Sulianto, and Kusunoki are part of a wide-ranging investigation into alleged corrupt practices by employees of
Alstom and Marubeni. Five other individuals, as well as Alstom and Marubeni, have pleaded guilty in the case so far, and Lawrence Hoskins, a
former senior vice president at Alstom, was found guilty on Nov. 6, 2019, following a jury trial, of 11 counts of conspiracy, violating the FCPA,
and money laundering.

The FBI's Los Angeles Field Office is investigating the case with assistance from the FBIâs Meriden, Connecticut, Resident Agency. The Criminal
Divisionâs Office of International Affairs assisted in the investigation. Senior Deputy Chief Daniel S. Kahn and Assistant Chief Lorinda Laryea of
the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney David E. Novick of the District of Connecticut are prosecuting the case.

The department appreciates the significant cooperation provided by its law enforcement colleagues in Indonesia, Switzerland's Office of the
Attorney General, as well as authorities in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Singapore and Taiwan.

The Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice Departmentâs FCPA

enforcement efforts can be found at www. justice. gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.

DEFERRED PROSECUTION AGREEMENT

Defendant Embraer S.A. (the âCompanyâ), pursuant to authority granted by the
Companyâs Board of Directors, and the United States Department of Justice, Criminal Division,
Fraud Section (the âSectionâ), enter into this deferred prosecution agreement (the âAgreementâ.

Criminal Information and Acceptance of Responsibility

1. The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Section will file the attached
two-count criminal Information in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
Florida charging the Company with (i) one count of conspiracy to commit offenses against the
United States in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 371, that is, to violate the anti-
bribery and books and records provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977
(âFCPAâ), as amended, Title 15, United States Code, Sections 78dd-1, 78m(b)(2)(A), 78m(b)(5),
and 78ff(a); and (ii) one count of violating the internal controls provisions of the FCPA, Title 15,
United States Code, Sections 78m(b)(2)(B), 78m(b)(5), and 78ff(a). In so doing, the Company:

(a) knowingly waives its right to indictment on these charges, as well as all rights to a speedy
 

a

Case &:16-cr-60294.iC Documents Enferec on FLSD Backet TQ/24/2016 Page 2 af 59

trial pursuant to the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, Title 18, United States
Code, Section 3161, and Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 48(b); and (b) knowingly waives
any objection with respect to venue to any charges by the United States arising out of the
conduct described in the attached Statement of Facts and consents to the filing of the
Information, as provided under the terms of this Agreement, in the United States District Court
for the Southern District of Florida. The Section agrees to defer prosecution of the Company
pursuant to the terms and conditions described below.

2. The Company admits, accepts, and acknowledges that it is responsible under
United States law for the acts of its officers, directors, employees, and agents as charged in the
Information, and as set forth in the attached Statement of F acts, and that the allegations described
in the Information and the facts described in the attached Statement of Facts are true and
accurate. Should the Section pursue the prosecution that is deferred by this Agreement, the
Company stipulates to the admissibility of the attached Statement of Facts in any proceeding,
including any trial, guilty plea, or sentencing proceeding, and will not contradict anything in the
Statement of Facts at any such proceeding.

Term of the Agreement

3. This Agreement is effective for a period beginning on the date on which the
Information is filed and ending three years from the later of the date on which the Information is
filed or the date on which the independent compliance monitor (the âMonitorâ) is retained by the
Company, as described in Paragraphs 11-13 below (the âTermâ). The Company agrees,
however, that, in the event the Section determines, in its sole discretion, that the Company has
knowingly violated any provision of this Agreement, an extension or extensions of the Term may

be imposed by the Section, in its sole discretion, for up to a total additional time period of one
2
 

ry

Case &:16-cr-60294.iC Documents Enferec on FLSOD Backet TQ/24/2016 Page 3 af 59

year, without prejudice to the Sectionâs right to proceed as provided in Paragraphs 16-20 below.
Any extension of the Agreement extends all terms of this Agreement, including the terms of the
monitorship in Attachment D, for an equivalent period. Conversely, in the event the Section
finds, in its sole discretion, that there exists a change in circumstances sufficient to eliminate the
need for the monitorship in Attachment D, and that the other provisions of this Agreement have
been satisfied, the Agreement may be terminated early. If the Court rejects the Agreement, all
the provisions of the Agreement shall be deemed null and void, and the Term shall be deemed to
have not begun.

Relevant Considerations

4. The Section enters into this Agreement based on the individual facts and

circumstances presented by this case, including:

(a) the Company did not voluntarily disclose the FCPA violations to the Section; the
investigation of the matter commenced when the Securities and Exchange
Commission (âSECâ) served the Company with a subpoena;

(b) the Company fully cooperated with the Sectionâs investigation and provided all
non-privileged relevant facts known to the Company, including information about
individuals involved in the misconduct, which assisted in the prosecutions of
individuals by foreign authorities for the misconduct described in the attached
Statement of Facts;

(c) the Company had an inadequate compliance program at the time of the criminal
conduct;

(d) the Company now has designed and is implementing a more adequate compliance

program and system of internal accounting controls, has committed to ensuring

that these will be implemented in a manner that satisfies the elements set forth in
Attachment C to this Agreement, and has agreed to engage the Monitor pursuant
to the terms described herein;

the Company has engaged in partial remediation: it has disciplined a number of
Company employees and executives engaged in the misconduct described in the
attached Statement of Facts, but did not discipline a senior executive who was (at
the very least) aware of bribery discussions in emails in 2004 and had oversight
responsibility for the employees engaged in those discussions;

the nature and seriousness of the offense, including its pervasiveness throughout
each of the Companyâs three separate sales divisions and the involvement of high-
level executives in each set of criminal conduct recounted in the attached
Statement of Facts;

the Company has no prior criminal history;

the Company has agreed to continue to cooperate with the Section as set forth in
this Agreement in any investigation of the Company and its officers, directors,
employees, agents, business partners, and consultants relating to violations of the
FCPA;

the Company has agreed to disgorge the profits from the misconduct described in
the attached Statement of Facts to the SEC and to Brazilian authorities;
accordingly, after considering (a) through (i) above, the Company will enter into
the Agreement, pay a criminal penalty of 20% below the low end of United States
Sentencing Guidelines range, and the Monitor will be imposed pursuant to the

terms outlined herein.

subject to applicable law and regulations, until the later of the date upon which all investigations
and prosecutions arising out of such conduct are concluded, or the end of the Term. At the
request of the Section, the Company shall also cooperate fully with other domestic or foreign law
enforcement and regulatory authorities and agencies, as well as the Multilateral Development

protected by a valid claim of attorney-client privilege or work product doctrine with respect to its
activities, those of its parent company and affiliates, and those of its present and former directors,
officers, employees, agents, and consultants, including any evidence or allegations and internal
or external investigations, about which the Company has any knowledge or about which the
Section may inquire. This obligation of truthful disclosure includes, but is not limited to, the
obligation of the Company to provide to the Section, upon request, any document, record or
other tangible evidence about which the Section may inquire of the Company.

b. Upon request of the Section, the Company shall designate knowledgeable

employees, agents or attorneys to provide to the Section the information and materials described

must at all times provide complete, truthful, and accurate information,

c. The Company shall use its best efforts to make available for interviews or
testimony, as requested by the Section, present or former officers, directors, employees, agents
and consultants of the Company. This obligation includes, but is not limited to, sworn testimony

enforcement and regulatory authorities. Cooperation under this Paragraph shall include
identification of witnesses who, to the knowledge of the Company, may have material
information regarding the matters under investigation.

d. With respect to any information, testimony, documents, records or other
tangible evidence provided to the Section pursuant to this Agreement, the Company consents to
any and all disclosures, subject to applicable law and regulations, to other governmental
authorities, including United States authorities and those of a foreign government, as well as the
MDBs, of such materials as the Section, in its sole discretion, shall deem appropriate.

6. In addition to the obligations in Paragraph 5, during the Term, should the
Company learn of credible evidence or allegations of corrupt payments, false books, records, and
accounts, or the failure to implement adequate internal accounting controls, the Company shall
promptly report such evidence or allegations to the Section.

Payment of Monetary Penalty

7. The Section and the Company agree that application of the United States

Sentencing Guidelines (âUSSGâ or âSentencing Guidelinesâ) to determine the applicable fine

range yields the following analysis:

The Company agrees to pay a monetary penalty in the amount of $107,285,090 to the United
States Treasury no later than five business days after the filing of the Information. The Company
and the Section agree that this penalty is appropriate given the facts and circumstances of this
case, as set forth above. The $107,285,090 penalty is final and shall not be refunded.
Furthermore, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed an agreement by the Section that
$107,285,090 is the maximum penalty that may be imposed in any future prosecution, and the
Section is not precluded from arguing in any future prosecution that the Court should impose a
higher fine, although the Section agrees that under those circumstances, it will recommend to the
Court that any amount paid under this Agreement should be offset against any fine the Court
imposes as part of a future judgment. The Company acknowledges that no tax deduction may be
sought in connection with the payment of any part of this $107,285,090 penalty. The Company
shall not seek or accept directly or indirectly reimbursement or indemnification from any source
with regard to the penalty or disgorgement amounts that the Company pays pursuant to this
Agreement or any other agreement entered into with an enforcement authority or regulator
concerning the facts set forth in the attached Statement of Facts.
Conditional Release from Liability
8. Subject to Paragraph 16-20, the Section agrees, except as provided in this
Agreement, that it will not bring any criminal or civil case against the Company relating to any
. of the conduct described in the attached Statement of Facts or the criminal Information filed
pursuant to this Agreement or for the conduct that the Company disclosed to the Section prior to
the signing of this Agreement. The Section, however, may use any information related to the
conduct described in the attached Statement of Facts against the Company: (a) in a prosecution

for perjury or obstruction of justice; (b) in a prosecution for making a false statement; (c) in a
8
Case &:16-cr-60294.iC Documents Enferec on FLSOD Backet TQ/24/2016 Page 9 af So

prosecution or other proceeding relating to any crime of violence; or (d) in a prosecution or other
proceeding relating to a violation of any provision of Title 26 of the United States Code.
a. This Agreement does not provide any protection against prosecution for
any future conduct by the Company.
b. In addition, this Agreement does not provide any protection against
prosecution of any individuals, regardless of their affiliation with the Company.
Corporate Compliance Program

9. The Company represents that it has implemented and will continue to implement
a compliance and ethics program throughout its operations, including those of its affiliates,
agents, and joint ventures, and those of its contractors and subcontractors whose responsibilities
include interacting with foreign officials or other activities carrying a high risk of corruption,
designed to prevent and detect violations of the FCPA and other applicable anti-corruption laws.

10. In order to address any deficiencies in its internal accounting controls, policies,
and procedures, the Company represents that it has undertaken, and will continue to undertake in
the future, in a manner consistent with all of its obligations under this Agreement, a review of its
existing internal accounting controls, policies, and procedures regarding compliance with the
FCPA and other applicable anti-corruption laws. Where necessary and appropriate, the
Company agrees to adopt a new compliance program, or to modify its existing one, including
internal controls, compliance policies, and procedures in order to ensure that it maintains: (a) an
effective system of internal accounting controls designed to ensure the making and keeping of
fair and accurate books, records, and accounts; and (b) a rigorous anti-corruption compliance
program that incorporates relevant internal accounting controls, as well as policies and

procedures designed to effectively detect and deter violations of the FCPA and other applicable
9
Case O:16-cr-60294-NC Document 2 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/24/2016 Page TO of 59

anti-corruption laws. The compliance program, including the internal accounting controls
system will include, but not be limited to, the minimum elements set forth in Attachment C.
Independent Compliance Monitor

11. Promptly after the Sectionâs selection pursuant to Paragraph 12 below, the
Company agrees to retain a Monitor for the term specified in Paragraph 13. The Monitorâs
duties and authority, and the obligations of the Company with respect to the Monitor and the
Section, are set forth in Attachment D, which is incorporated by reference into this Agreement.
Upon the execution of this Agreement, and after consultation with the Section, the Company will
propose to the Section a pool of three qualified candidates to serve as the Monitor. If the Section
determines, in its sole discretion, that any of the candidates are not, in fact, qualified to serve as
the Monitor, or if the Section, in its sole discretion, is not satisfied with the candidates proposed,
the Section reserves the right to seek additional nominations from the Company.
The parties will endeavor to complete the monitor selection process within sixty days of the
execution of this Agreement. The Monitor candidates or their team members shall have, at a
minimum, the following qualifications:

a. demonstrated expertise with respect to the FCPA and other applicable
anti-corruption laws, including experience counseling on FCPA issues;

b. experience designing and/or reviewing corporate compliance policies,
procedures and internal controls, including FCPA and anti-corruption policies, procedures and
internal controls;

c. the ability to access and deploy resources as necessary to discharge the

Monitorâs duties as described in the Agreement; and

10
Case O:16-cr-60294-NC Document 2 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/24/2016 Page Tl of 59

d. sufficient independence from the Company to ensure effective and
impartial performance of the Monitorâs duties as described in the Agreement.

12. The Section retains the right, in its sole discretion, to choose the Monitor from
among the candidates proposed by the Company, though the Company may express its
preference(s) among the candidates. In the event the Section rejects all proposed Monitors, the
Company shall propose an additional three candidates within twenty business days after
receiving notice of the rejection. This process shall continue until a Monitor acceptable to both
parties is chosen. The Section and the Company will use their best efforts to complete the
selection process within sixty calendar days of the execution of this Agreement. If the Monitor
resigns or is otherwise unable to fulfill his or her obligations as set out herein and in Attachment
D, the Company shall within forty-five (45) business days recommend a pool of three qualified
Monitor candidates from which the Section will choose a replacement.

13. The Monitorâs term shall be three years from the date on which the Monitor is
retained by the Company, subject to extension or early termination as described in Paragraph 3.
The Monitorâs powers, duties, and responsibilities, as well as additional circumstances that may
support an extension of the Monitorâs term, are set forth in Attachment D. The Company agrees
that it will not employ or be affiliated with the Monitor or the Monitorâs firm for a period of not
less than two years from the date on which the Monitorâs term expires. Nor will the Company
discuss with the Monitor or the Monitorâs firm the possibility of further employment or

Deferred Prosecution

14. In consideration of the undertakings agreed to by the Company herein, the
Section agrees that any prosecution of the Company for the conduct set forth in the attached
Statement of Facts be and hereby is deferred for the Term.

15, The Section further agrees that if the Company fully complies with all of its
obligations under this Agreement, the Section will not continue the criminal prosecution against
the Company described in Paragraph | and, at the conclusion of the Term, this Agreement shall
expire. Within six months of the Agreementâs expiration, the Section shall seek dismissal with
prejudice of the criminal Information filed against the Company described in Paragraph 1, and
agrees not to file charges in the future against the Company based on the conduct described in
this Agreement and the attached Statement of Facts.

Breach of the Agreement

16. If, during the Term, the Company (a) commits any felony under U.S. federal law;
(b) provides in connection with this Agreement deliberately false, incomplete, or misleading
information, including in connection with its disclosure of information about individual
culpability; (c) fails to cooperate as set forth in Paragraphs 5 and 6 of this Agreement; (d) fails to
implement a compliance program as set forth in Paragraphs 9 and 10 of this Agreement and
Attachment C; (e) commits any acts that, had they occurred within the jurisdictional reach of the
FCPA, would be a violation of the FCPA; or (f) otherwise fails specifically to perform or to
fulfill completely each of the Companyâs obligations under the Agreement, regardless of whether
the Section becomes aware of such a breach after the Term is complete, the Company shall
thereafter be subject to prosecution for any federal criminal violation of which the Section has

knowledge, including, but not limited to, the charges in the Information described in Paragraph
12
Case O:16-cr-60294-NC Document 2 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/24/2016 Page 13 of 59

1, which may be pursued by the Section in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
Florida or any other appropriate venue. Determination of whether the Company has breached
the Agreement and whether to pursue prosecution of the Company shall be in the Sectionâs sole
discretion. Any such prosecution may be premised on information provided by the Company or
its personnel. Any such prosecution relating to the conduct described in the attached Statement
of Facts or relating to conduct known to the Section prior to the date on which this Agreement
was signed that is not time-barred by the applicable statute of limitations on the date of the
signing of this Agreement may be commenced against the Company, notwithstanding the
expiration of the statute of limitations, between the signing of this Agreement and the expiration
of the Term plus one year. Thus, by signing this Agreement, the Company agrees that the statute
of limitations with respect to any such prosecution that is not time-barred on the date of the
signing of this Agreement shall be tolled for the Term plus one year. In addition, the Company
agrees that the statute of limitations as to any violation of federal law related to corrupt
payments, false books, records, and accounts, or the failure to implement adequate internal
accounting controls, including violation of the anti-bribery or internal controls provisions of the
FCPA or violation of the Travel Act, Title 18, United States Code, Section 1952, that occurs
during the Term will be tolled from the date upon which the violation occurs until the earlier of
the date upon which the Section is made aware of the violation or the duration of the Term plus
five years, and that this period shall be excluded from any calculation of time for purposes of the
application of the statute of limitations.

17. In the event the Section determines that the Company has breached this
Agreement, the Section agrees to provide the Company with written notice prior to instituting

any prosecution resulting from such breach. Within thirty days of receipt of such notice, the
13
Case O:16-cr-60294-NC Document 2 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/24/2016 Page 14 of 59

Company shall have the opportunity to respond to the Section in writing to explain the nature
and circumstances of the breach, as well as the actions the Company has taken to address and
remediate the situation, which the Section shall consider in determining whether to pursue
prosecution of the Company.

18. In the event that the Section determines that the Company has breached this
Agreement: (a) all statements made by or on behalf of the Company to the Section or to the
Court, including the attached Statement of Facts, and any testimony given by the Company
before a grand jury, a court, or any tribunal, or at any legislative hearings, whether prior or
subsequent to this Agreement, and any leads derived from such statements or testimony, shall be
admissible in evidence in any and all criminal proceedings brought by the Section against the
Company; and (b) the Company shall not assert any claim under the United States Constitution,
Rule 1 1(f) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rule 410 of the Federal Rules of
Evidence, or any other federal rule that any such statements or testimony made by or on behalf of
the Company prior or subsequent to this Agreement, or any leads derived therefrom, should be
suppressed or are otherwise inadmissible. The decision whether conduct or statements of any
current director, officer or employee, or any person acting on behalf of, or at the direction of, the
Company, will be imputed to the Company for the purpose of determining whether the Company
has violated any provision of this Agreement shall be in the sole discretion of the Section.

19, The Company acknowledges that the Section has made no representations,
assurances, or promises concerning what sentence may be imposed by the Court if the Company
breaches this Agreement and this matter proceeds to judgment. The Company further
acknowledges that any such sentence is solely within the discretion of the Court and that nothing

in this Agreement binds or restricts the Court in the exercise of such discretion.
14
Case O:16-cr-60294-NC Document 2 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/24/2016 Page 15 of 58

20. Thirty days after the expiration of the period of deferred prosecution specified in
this Agreement, the Company, by the Chief Executive Officer of the Company and the Chief
Financial Officer of the Company, will certify to the Section that the Company has met its
disclosure obligations pursuant to Paragraph 6 of this Agreement. Each certification will be
deemed a material statement and representation by the Company to the executive branch of the
United States for purposes of 18 U.S.C. Â§ 1001, and it will be deemed to have been made in the
judicial district in which this Agreement is filed.

Sale, Merger, or Other Change in Corporate Form of Company

21. Except as may otherwise be agreed by the parties in connection with a particular
transaction, the Company agrees that in the event that, during the Term, it undertakes any change
in corporate form, including if it sells, merges, or transfers business operations that are material
to the Companyâs consolidated operations, or to the operations of any subsidiaries or affiliates
involved in the conduct described in the attached Statement of Facts, as they exist as of the date
of this Agreement, whether such sale is structured as a sale, asset sale, merger, transfer, or other
change in corporate form, it shall include in any contract for sale, merger, transfer, or other
change in corporate form a provision binding the purchaser, or any successor in interest thereto,
to the obligations described in this Agreement. The Company shall obtain approval from the
Section at least thirty days prior to undertaking any such sale, merger, transfer, or other change
in corporate form, including dissolution, in order to give the Section an opportunity to determine
if such change in corporate form would impact the terms or obligations of the Agreement.

Public Statements by Company
22, The Company expressly agrees that it shall not, through present or future

attorneys, officers, directors, employees, agents or any other person authorized to speak for the
15
Case O:16-cr-60294-NC Document 2 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/24/2016 Page 16 of 59

Company make any public statement, in litigation or otherwise, contradicting the acceptance of
responsibility by the Company set forth in Paragraph 2 above or the facts described in the
attached Statement of Facts. Any such contradictory statement shall, subject to cure rights of the
Company described below, constitute a breach of this Agreement, and the Company thereafter
shall be subject to prosecution as set forth in Paragraphs 16-19 of this Agreement. The decision
whether any public statement by any such person contradicting a fact contained in the Statement
of Facts will be imputed to the Company for the purpose of determining whether it has breached
this Agreement shall be at the sole discretion of the Section. If the Section determines that a
public statement by any such person contradicts in whole or in part a statement contained in the
attached Statement of Facts, the Section shall so notify the Company, and the Company may
avoid a breach of this Agreement by publicly repudiating such statement(s) within five business
days after notification. The Company shall be permitted to raise defenses and to assert
affirmative claims in other proceedings relating to the matters set forth in the attached Statement
of Facts provided that such defenses and claims do not contradict, in whole or in part, a
statement contained in the attached Statement of Facts. This Paragraph does not apply to any
statement made by any present or former officer, director, employee, or agent of the Company in
the course of any criminal, regulatory, or civil case initiated against such individual, unless such
individual is speaking on behalf of the Company.

23. The Company agrees that if it or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries or
affiliates issues a press release or holds any press conference in connection with this Agreement,
the Company shall first consult with the Section to determine (a) whether the text of the release

or proposed statements at the press conference are true and accurate with respect to matters

16
 

Case O:16-cr-60204-1C Document? Ertereconm FLSD Docket 10/24/2016 Page LY of 59

between the Section and the Company; and (b) whether the Section has any objection to the
release.

24, The Section agrees, if requested to do so, to bring to the attention of law
enforcement and regulatory authorities the facts and circumstances relating to the nature of the
conduct underlying this Agreement, including the nature and quality of the Companyâs
cooperation and remediation. By agreeing to provide this information to such authorities, the
Section is not agreeing to advocate on behalf of the Company, but rather is agreeing to provide

The following Statement of Facts is incorporated by reference as part of the Deferred
Prosecution Agreement (the âAgreementâ) between the United States Department of Justice,
Criminal Division, Fraud Section (the Sectionâ) and Embraer S.A, (âEMBRAERâ),
EMBRAER hereby agrees and stipulates that the following information is true and accurate.
EMBRAER admits, accepts, and acknowledges that it is responsible for the acts of its officers,
directors, employees, and agents. Should the Section pursue the prosecution that is deferred by
this Agreement, EMBRAER agrees that it will neither contest the admissibility of, nor
contradict, this Statement of Facts in any such proceeding. The following facts took place during
the relevant time frame and establish beyond a reasonable doubt the charges set forth in the
criminal Information attached to this Agreement:

Relevant Entities and Individuals

 

l, EMBRAER was an aircraft manufacturing company incorporated and
headquartered in Brazil. EMBRAER manufactured commercial, executive, and defense aircraft
and sold them to governmental and private customers throughout the world. EMBRAER
maintained its North American regional office in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Shares of
EMBRAERâs stock traded on the New York Stock Exchange (âNYSEâ) as American depositary
receipts (âADRsâ), and EMBRAER was required to file periodic reports with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (âSECâ) under Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. Â§

2. Embraer Representations LLC (âEmbraer RLâ) was a subsidiary wholly owned
by EMBRAER, and incorporated in Delaware. Embraer RLâs financial statements were
consolidated into EMBRAERâs financial statements. Embraer RL held and maintained a bank
account in New York from which EMBRAER made improper payments during the relevant
time.

3. âEmbraer Executive A,â an individual whose identity is known to the United

the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-] (C1). Beginning at least by May 2007,
EMBRAER referred to Dominican Official as the âGeneral Managerâ or âManaging Director of
the Project.â Dominican Official was a âforeign officialâ as that term is used in the FCPA, Title
15, United States Code, Section 78dd-1(f)(1) (âforeign officialâ),

The Unlawful Schemes
The Dominican Republic

14. From in or around August 2008 through at least in or around October 2010,
EMBRAER, through its employees and agents, agreed to pay and did pay Dominican Official
approximately $3.52 million to obtain a defense contract valued at approximately $96.4 million.

15. Beginning in or around June 2007, EMBRAER began efforts to sell the Super
Tucano aircraft, a turbine-driven military aircraft typically used for missions to fight drug
trafficking, counter insurgence missions, and training, to the FAD. There was no public bid or
tender for this sale. Rather, EMBRAER developed and negotiated the sale directly with
representatives of the FAD, and Dominican Official was EMBRAERâs primary point of contact
at the FAD.

16. By mid-2008, many of the terms of the sale had been negotiated but the
Dominican Republic Senate (âDominican Senateâ) had not yet approved the dealâs financing or

the purchase agreement, which were necessary steps for the completion of the sale). EMBRAER

A-4
Case O16-cr-60294-NC Document 2 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/24/2016 Page 26 of 59

employees and Dominican Official began discussing how they could influence the Dominican
Senate to provide the necessary approvals.

17. On or about August 25, 2008, an EMBRAER executive informed Embraer
Executive A by email that Dominican Official would be talking to a Dominican Senator about
compensation for the Senator but that Dominican Official wanted to talk to Embraer Executive A
before having that conversation. Embraer Executive A informed the other EMBRAER executive
that Embraer Executive A and Dominican Official had already spoken.

18. | Onor about September 1, 2008, Embraer Executive A agreed to pay Dominican
Official 3.7% of the value of the contract (which ultimately came to approximately $3.52
million) if the sale was completed. That same day, Embraer Executive A emailed another
EMBRAER executive that the Dominican Senateâs meeting to approve financing of the
transaction would soon take place and that âthey want to have the agent agreement doc signed
before the meeting.â

19. In or around early September 2008, Dominican Official and Embraer Executive A
agreed that the payment referred to in Paragraph 18 would be paid to three separate Dominican
shell entities: one would receive $2.5 million, a second would receive $920,000, and a third
would receive $100,000.

20. âIn or around August 2008, Dominican Official promoted the Super Tucano
contract before the Dominican Senate Finance Committee and presented the terms of the deal to
the Dominican Senate. The following month, on or about September 16, 2008, the Dominican
Senate approved the financing for the deal.

21. On or about December 24, 2008, the Dominican Senate approved the sale and

financing contracts for the eight Super Tucano airplanes, agreeing to purchase the aircraft for

A-5
Case O:16-cr-60294-NC Document 2 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/24/2016 Page 2? of 53

approximately $96.4 million. Shortly before it did so, the Secretary of the FAD issued a letter to
EMBRAER authorizing Dominican Official to sign, on behalf of the Dominican Republic,
invoices and certificates called for by the sales contract.

22. Onor about January 9, 2009, EMBRAER publicly announced its sale of eight
Super Tucano aircraft to the Dominican Republic.

23. Beginning at least when EMBRAER publicly announced the sale, Dominican
Official repeatedly contacted EMBRAER requesting the payments that had been promised. For
example, on or about March 16, 2009, Dominican Official emailed an EMBRAER employee
demanding that EMBRAER begin making the agreed-upon payments, noting that âinterested and
compromised partiesâ were exerting pressure.

24, Based on these repeated requests, on or about April 24, 2009, Embraer RL wired
$100,000 to one of the shell companies referenced in Paragraph 19 from Embraer RLâs bank
account in New York to a bank account in the Dominican Republic.

25. Following the $100,000 payment referenced in Paragraph 24, Dominican Official
persisted with efforts to collect the promised payments, and an executive in EMBRAERâs legal
department provided senior EMBRAER managers with guidance on how to make those
payments in a manner that would conceal their true purpose.

26. For example, on or about September 30, 2009, an EMBRAER employee sent an
email to an EMBRAER executive detailing how an executive in EMBRAERâs legal department
had advised using a third-party agent, âAgent A,â who had previously provided agency services
to EMBRAER, to remit the remaining two payments to Dominican Official instead of directly

paying the shell companies that Dominican Official had identified.

A-6
Case O16-cr-60294-NC Document 2 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/24/2016 Page 28 of 59

27. On or about October 16, 2009, an EMBRAER executive emailed the same
executive in EMBRAERâs legal department asking for additional guidance on how to proceed,
adding that EMBRAER feared pressure at any moment from âfour stars,â which was a reference
to Dominican government officials.

28. | Onor about November 5, 2009, Embraer Executive A emailed Agent A to say
that Dominican Official would be Agent Aâs point of contact in the Dominican Republic, that
Dominican Official was an âFAD colonel but the classmate of 4 star generals,â that Dominican
Official had provided a âsafeâ phone number to use, and that Dominican Official had been
designated as the intermediary between EMBRAER and the groups âinvolved on the other side.â

29, On or about November 16, 2009, Dominican Official emailed Embraer Executive
A to confirm that Dominican Official had spoken with Agent A, and expressed satisfaction over
Agent Aâs cooperation, but warned that at least one of the outstanding payments needed to be
made by the end of the month.

30. Onor about March 12, 2010, Embraer RL and Agent Aâs company entered into a
purported agency agreement, pursuant to which Embraer RL would pay Agent Aâs company an
8% commission on any successful sales of aircraft to the Jordanian Air Force. The agreement
called for Embraer RL to make advance payments to Agent Aâs company of $2.5 million and
$920,000, which, when totaled, equaled the $3,420,000 that EMBRAER had promised to
Dominican Official.

31, On or about April 6, 2010, Agent Aâs company submitted to Embraer RL two |
invoices for âsales promotion servicesâ in the amounts of $2.5 million and $920,000. An
internal EMBRAER memorandum indicated that the payments were related to the commission

owed for the Super Tucano aircrafts sold to the government of the Dominican Republic, not

A-7
Case O:16-cr-60294-NC Document 2 Entered om FLSD Docket 10/24/2018 Page 29 of 59

potential sales to the Jordanian Air Force. Indeed, EMBRAER never sold any aircraft to the
Jordanian Air Force, Agent A rendered no services in connection with any attempted sale to the
Jordanian Air Force, and Agent A rendered no legitimate services to EMBRAER related to the
sale of Super Tucanos to the FAD.

32, On or about May 24 and June 25, 2010, Embraer RL wired $2.5 million and
$920,000, respectively, from its New York bank account to Agent Aâs companyâs bank account
in Uruguay.

33. On or about October 21, 2010, Dominican Official sent an email to Agent A from
an email account in the United States that contained wiring instructions for a Panamanian bank
account. Agent A transferred more than $3 million to Dominican Official, including more than
â¬1 million to the Panamanian bank account identified in the October 21, 2010, email.

34. | The payments to Agent Aâs company were falsely booked as sales commissions
in Embraer RLâs internal accounting records and as selling expenses in EMBRAERâs
consolidated 2010 financial statement. The April 24, 2009, payment of $100,000 to one of the
Dominican shell companies was likewise falsely booked as a selling expense in EMBRAERâs
consolidated 2010 statement.

Saudi Arabia

35. From in or around November 2009 through February 2011, EMBRAER agreed to
pay and did pay Saudi Arabia Official more than $1.5 million to obtain a contract for the sale of
three business jets, valued at approximately $93 million, to Saudi Arabia Instrumentality.

36. In or around 2007, EMBRAER learned that Saudi Arabia Instrumentality was
interested in purchasing executive jets. By 2009, Saudi Arabia Instrumentality had narrowed its
interest to purchasing aircraft from EMBRAER and one other manufacturer.

A-8
 

Case O:16-cr-60204-1C Document? Erterecionm FLSD Docket 10/24/2016 Page 80 of 59

37.  Inor around early December 2009, Embraer Executive B met with Saudi Arabia
Official in London. Saudi Arabia Official offered to help EMBRAER win the aircraft contract
and to change the terms of the deal from the sale of used jets to new jets, which would be a more
lucrative transaction for EMBRAER, if EMBRAER compensated Saudi Arabia Official.
Embraer Executive B knew that Saudi Arabia Official was a high-level official at Saudi Arabia
Instrumentality and believed that Saudi Arabia Official could deliver on the promise.

38. Saudi Arabia Official and Embraer Executive B negotiated the amount of Saudi
Arabia Officialâs payment. Saudi Arabia Official rejected an initial offer of $200,000 per
aircraft. Embraer Executive B sent an email to Embraer Executive Bâs supervisor and another
EMBRAER executive on or about December 10, 2009, indicating that Saudi Arabia Official had
justified the request for a higher payment on the grounds that â[h]e has budget for used only and
will have to lobby for more funds to take new [aircraft] over used.â Embraer Executive B added,
âIt]here is more to come to replace the entire fleet they have with 170,s [sic] [Saudi Arabia
Official] sees this as long term.â Embraer Executive Bâs supervisor approved offering a per-
aircraft payment of $550,000.

39. On or about December 28, 2009, Embraer Executive B and Saudi Arabia Official
agreed on a per-aircraft payment of $550,000, for a total amount of $1.65 million. Two days
later, on or about December 30, 2009, Embraer Executive B told another EMBRAER executive
that Saudi Arabia Instrumentality had opted to purchase three new jets.

40. Embraer Executive B devised a plan to conceal the payments to Saudi Arabia
Official by funneling them through Agent B, which had no experience in the aircraft industry or

in Saudi Arabia.
 

Case O:16-cr-60294-NC Document 2 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/24/2016 Page 31 of 58

4l. On or about January 5, 2010, Embraer Executive B sent an email about the
transaction with Saudi Arabia Instrumentality to a number of EMBRAER employees
summarizing âwhere we are based on our latest talks today[] with [] senior mngt [for Saudi
Arabia Instrumentality] and the party driving this deal through who[m] we are working with on
an [agency] basis.â Embraer Executive B reported in the email about a meeting between âthe
head of [Saudi Arabia Instrumentalityâs] Aviation Dept (who is helping us with this deal),â and
the committee that allocated funds for the purchase, and stated that âour contact on the
transaction (head of the dept) has advised that we must hold our price during the negotiation on
the basis we have put forward our best offer for the basic aircraft and therefore[] cannot negotiate
further on this.â Embraer Executive B explained that it âha[d] been made extremely clear and
agreed with our contact[] that should any additional funds be required to cover any other
concession that exceeds our $120k limit, this would be from the [agency commission] amount in
reserve.â

42. | Onor about February 26, 2010, pursuant to Embraer Executive Bâs request,
EMBRAER executives, including one in EMBRAERâs legal department, approved the agency
arrangement with Agent B, pursuant to which Agent B would purportedly serve as EMBRAERâs
sales agent for the deal with Saudi Arabia Instrumentality.

43. Onor about March 5, 2010, Embraer RL executed an agency contract with Agent
B signed by EMBRAER executives, pursuant to which Agent B was to âpromote sales of ...
aircraft manufactured by Embraer ... solely and specifically toâ a subsidiary of Saudi Arabia
Instrumentality.

44. Less than two weeks later, on or about March 15, 2010, EMBRAER and a U.S.-
based subsidiary of Saudi Arabia Instrumentality entered into an aircraft purchase agreement,

A-10
 

Case O:16-cr-60294-NC Document 2 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/24/2016 Page 32 of 59

pursuant to which the subsidiary agreed to purchase three new aircraft for approximately $93
million. The aircraft were delivered in or around November and December of 2010.

45. In or around December 2010, Agent B submitted three invoices, each in the
amount of $550,000, for its purported commission, even though Agent B had not rendered any
services to EMBRAER in connection with the sale. Executives at EMBRAER approved paying
the invoices. The payments were made through two wire transfers from Embraer RLâs bank
account in New York to Agent Bâs bank account in South Africa: $550,000 on or about
December 22, 2010, and $1.1 million on or about February 18, 2011. Embraer RL booked the
payments as âsales commissionsâ and the payments were consolidated into the parentâs financial
statements.

46. Agent B subsequently transferred more than $1.4 million of the $1.65 million it
received from Embraer RL to bank accounts held by Saudi Arabia Officialâs longtime
acquaintance, who in turn kept a portion of the monies and transferred the remainder to Saudi
Arabia Official.

Mozambique

47. From in or around May 2008 through at least September 2008, EMBRAER
negotiated the sale of two commercial aircraft to LAM.

48. | EMBRAER submitted a formal proposal to LAM on or about May 21, 2008, for
the sale of two commercial aircraft for approximately $32 million each, with an option for LAM
to buy two more aircraft at the same price. The proposal followed nearly three years of work by
Embraer Executive D to convince LAM to purchase from EMBRAER rather than competitors.

49. In mid-August 2008, during negotiations between EMBRAER and LAM, Agent
C, who had not previously worked or had any contact with EMBRAER, contacted Embraer

A-1I1
 

Case O16-cr-60294-NC Document 2 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/24/2016 Page 33 of 59

Executive D and said that Agent C would be serving as a consultant on the deal referenced in
Paragraph 48.

50. Rather than reject Agent Câs solicitation, on or about August I1, 2008, Embraer
Executive D sent an email to two EMBRAER executives and proposed that they âcreate some
margins for the commissionsâ for Agent C in the pricing of the two optional aircraft LAM could
buy after purchasing the first two.

51. On or about August 13, 2008, Embraer Executive C sent an email to several
EMBRAER executives recounting a conversation with Agent C, in which Agent C told Embraer
Executive C that, even though EMBRAER had not been prepared to have a consultant, âwe'd
like to have a âgestureâ when delivering the first plane.â Embraer Executive C proposed in the
email that âwe have to show some gesture and maybe the value mentioned by [another
EMBRAER executive] (50K to 80K) would fit the actual need... .â Embraer Executive C had
advised Agent C how to set up a company to which EMBRAER could make purported
consultancy payments, telling Agent C that in order to receive a payment from EMBRAER,
Agent C âneeds to have a company, names, address and not be established in a tax-heaven [sic]
country ....â

52. In response, an EMBRAER executive who had received the email referenced in
Paragraph 51, agreed that they could offer to pay Agent C $50,000 for each of the first two
planes sold, and go up to $80,000 per plane if necessary, while also agreeing to a payment of
somewhere between 2 and 2.5% of the purchase price of the two optional planes, should LAM
purchase them.

53. Onor about August 18, 2008, Embraer Executive C conveyed the $50,000 offer
to Agent C. Embraer Executive C reported afterward in an email to other EMBRAER executives

A-12
 

Case O16-cr-60294-NC Document 2 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/24/2016 Page 34 of 59

that it appeared that Agent C was âexpecting [a] much higher fee,â and, indeed, after hearing the
amount, Agent C intimated that LAM may award the contract to a competitor instead.

54. On or about August 25, 2008, Mozambique Official called Embraer Executive D.
In an email the same day to other EMBRAER executives, Embraer Executive D recounted the
conversation, noting that Mozambique Official had âhighlighted that [Mozambique Official] had
received very nasty comments from some individuals, in relation to Embraerâs commission
proposal to [Agent C].â Mozambique Official further âindicated that some individuals felt that
Embraerâs proposal was an insult, and in a sense, it would have been less insulting to give
nothing, even if this was not an acceptable solution.â Embraer Executive D asked Mozambique
Official âwhat would [Agent C] expect from Embraer.â Mozambique Official responded that,
âin the current circumstances, [Mozambique Official] thought about one million USD.â After
some pushback from Embraer Executive D, Mozambique Official âfinally suggested that we
might get away with 800,000 USD (2 x400,000).â When Embraer Executive D told
Mozambique Official that EMBRAER âhad no budget for such consultancy fee,â Mozambique
Official suggested taking it from the profit margin on the two optional aircraft and also âasked if
[EMBRAER] could increase the aircraft price... .â

55. On or about September 15, 2008, EMBRAER and LAM executed the purchase
agreement for the sale of two E190 aircraft at approximately $32,690,000 each with a $312,000
down payment for a third aircraft. Mozambique Official was one of three LAM executives that
signed the purchase agreement on behalf of LAM.

56. On or about April 22, 2009, seven months after the execution of the purchase
agreement but before delivery of the first aircraft, Embraer RL entered into an agency agreement
with a company Agent C had recently formed in the Democratic Republic of S40 TomÃ© and

A-13
Case O:16-cr-60294-NC Document 2 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/24/2016 Page 35 of 58

Principe. Two EMBRAER executives signed the agency agreement on EMBRAERâs behalf.
The agency agreement authorized Agent Câs company to promote sales of the E190 âsolely and
specificallyâ to LAM, even though the sale of such aircraft had already been completed seven
months prior to the execution of the agreement, Agent Câs company did not exist at the time the
purchase agreement was signed, and Agent Câs company did not perform any legitimate work in
connection with the purchase agreement. The agreement with Agent Câs company falsely stated
that the sales promotion efforts identified therein had begun in or around March 2008.

57. Pursuant to the agency agreement described in Paragraph 56, Embraer RL agreed
to pay Agent Câs company $400,000 per aircraft (the exact amount Mozambique Official had
previously said EMBRAER could âget awayâ with paying). However, neither Agent C nor
Agent Câs company ever provided any legitimate services to EMBRAER.

58. EMBRAER delivered the two aircraft to LAM on or about July 30, 2009, and
September 2, 2009. Following the delivery of each aircraft, Agent Câs company submitted two
invoices to EMBRAER for $400,000 each, one dated August 15, 2009, and one dated September
24, 2009. An EMBRAER executive signed and approved both invoices for payment. On or
about August 31, 2009, Embraer RL wired $400,000, from its U.S.-based bank account to an
account at a bank in So TomÃ© and Principe, for further credit to the an account at a bank in
Portugal, which was held by Agent Câs company. On or about October 2, 2009, Embraer RL
wired an additional $400,000 from its U.S.-based bank account to Agent Câs companyâs
Portugal-based bank account. Embraer RL recorded these payments as âSales Commissionâ and
they were consolidated into EMBRAERâs books under âNet Operating (expenses) incomeâ as a

âSellingâ expense, specifically, âSales Commission.â

India

59. On or about July 3, 2008, EMBRAER executed a contract to provide three highly
specialized military aircraft to the Indian Air Force for approximately $208 million. In
connection with the deal, EMBRAER retained the services of Agent D pursuant to a 2005
agency agreement. It later paid $5.76 million to Agent D pursuant to a false agency agreement
signed in or around 2008.

60. Inor around January 2005, EMBRAER executed an agency agreement with a
shell company domiciled in the United Kingdom and affiliated with Agent D (although Agent
Dâs name never appeared in the agreement). Under the agency agreement, EMBRAER agreed to
pay the shell company a commission of 9% of the value of any defense contracts EMBRAER
obtained in India because EMBRAER believed Agent D could help ensure that any contract
would be awarded on a single-source, rather than competitive, basis. EMBRAER personnel
thought the agreement with Agent D was illegal under Indian law and thus took steps to conceal
its existence, including secreting the sole fully-executed version of the agreement in a safe
deposit box in London that could be opened only when both an EMBRAER employee and Agent
D or an associate of Agent D were present.

61. Less than a month after executing the agency agreement with the shell company,
on or about February 8, 2005, EMBRAER announced that it had signed a memorandum of
understanding (âMOUâ) with Indiaâs Defence Research and Development Organisation to
support the development of a new early warning radar system for the Indian Air Force, which
EMBRAER believed could ultimately result in EMBRAER securing a contract for the sale of

three Embraer 145 aircraft.

A-15
 

Case O:16-cr-60294-NC Document 2 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/24/2016 Page 37 of 53

62. On or about July 3, 2008, nearly three years after signing the MOU, the Indian Air
Force agreed to purchase three aircraft from EMBRAER for approximately $208 million (the
âIndia contractâ). The next day, on or about July 4, 2008, Agent D contacted EMBRAER
employees and demanded payment of the commission pursuant to the contract referenced in
Paragraph 60.

63. | Agent D continued making demands for payment and, in or around F ebruary and
March 2009, an EMBRAER executive met with lawyers representing Agent D to discuss Agent
D's payment demands. Following these discussions, EMBRAER executives agreed to pay $5.76
million to Agent D to settle the claim.

64. To conceal the payment referenced in Paragraph 63, EMBRAER created a false
agency agreement. On or about November 21, 2009, more than a year after EMBRAER was
awarded the India contract, EMBRAER, through its wholly owned subsidiary, ECC Investment
Switzerland AG (âECCâ), executed an agency agreement with a shell company domiciled in
Singapore and affiliated with Agent D for its purported services as an agent in a sale EMBRAER
had made to an unrelated customer in another country that had purchased an EMBRAER aircraft
more than a year earlier, in or around July 2008. The Singaporean shell company never
performed any services related to that sale or to the sale to the Indian Air Force.

65. The same day that the agency agreement was executed, the Singaporean shell
company delivered three invoices to ECC, each for $1.92 million. EMBRAER, through ECC,
remitted three payments to the shell company shortly thereafter. EMBRAERâs books and

records did not reflect that this transaction was related to its arrangement with Agent D.
 

Case O:16-cr-60204-1C Document? Ertereconm FLSD Docket 10/24/2016 Page 388 of 59

Profits

66. From the unlawful conduct described above, Embraerâs total profits were
$83,816,476.

EMBRAERâs Internal Accounting Controls

67, During the relevant period, EMBRAER knowingly and willfully failed to devise
and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. In particular, and as relevant
here, EMBRAER had no internal accounting controls that, among other things, (a) required
adequate due diligence for the retention of third-party consultants and agent; (b) required a fully
executed contract with a third-party before payment could be made to it; (c) required
documentation or other proof that services had been rendered by a third-party before payment
could be made to it; or (d) implemented oversight of the payment process to ensure that
payments were made pursuant to appropriate controls, including those described above.

68. For example, in connection with the Dominican Republic bribery scheme,
EMBRAER made payments to one of the shell companies identified by Dominican Official,
even though a foreign official had told EMBRAER to which company to make agency payments,
and EMBRAER had conducted no diligence on the shell company, did not have a signed contract
with the shell company, and knew that the shell company had not performed any legitimate
services in exchange for the payment.

69. Also in connection with the Dominican Republic bribery scheme, EMBRAER
made payments to Agent A for services purportedly rendered in connection with an aircraft sale
to the Jordanian Air Force, even though EMBRAER never sold any aircraft to the Jordanian Air
Force, and EMBRAER knew that Agent A had rendered no services in connection with any

attempted sale to the Jordanian Air Force, and even though an internal EMBRAER memorandum

A-17
Case O:16-cr-60294-NC Document 2 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/24/2016 Page 39 of 59

indicated that the payments were related to the commission owed for the Super Tucano aircrafts
sold to the government of the Dominican Republic, not potential sales to the Jordanian Air Force

70. Further, in connection with the Saudi Arabia bribery scheme, EMBRAER made
payments to Agent B, even though it had conducted minimal due diligence on Agent B, did so
almost exclusively on the basis of information Embraer Executive B personally provided to its
contracts and legal departments, and did not require any proof of services from Agent B before
making payment.

71, Similarly, in connection with the Mozambique scheme, the only due diligence
that EMBRAER conducted on Agent Câs company was limited to collecting the companyâs
registration documents, corporate by-laws, and board minutes directly from Agent C, and
EMBRAER did not require any proof of services from Agent C before making payment.

72. | Numerous high-level EMBRAER executives knew that the various agency
agreements referenced above falsely represented that payments were being made for legitimate
agency services, and that the true purpose of the payments made to the agents was to funnel
bribes to foreign officials. Many of the high-level executives who knew about the false nature of
the agreements and the improper purpose of the payments had the authority and responsibility to
ensure that EMBRAER devised and maintained an adequate system of internal accounting
controls, knew that EMBRAERâs then-existing internal accounting controls failed to prevent
EMBRAER from entering into false agency agreements and making improper payments, and
knowingly and willfully failed to implement adequate internal accounting controls to address the
known weaknesses, in part to permit EMBRAER to enter into false agency agreements and

funnel bribes to foreign officials.

The duties and authority of the Independent Compliance Monitor (the âMonitorâ), and
the obligations of Embraer S.A. (the âCompanyâ), on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries and
affiliates, with respect to the Monitor and the United States Department of Justice, Criminal

access to information, documents, records, facilities, or current or former employees of the
Company that may be subject to a claim of attorney-client privilege or to the attorney work-

product doctrine, or where the Company reasonably believes production would otherwise be

D-2
 

Case O:16-cr-60294-NC Document 2 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/24/2016 Page 52 of 59

inconsistent with applicable law, the Company shall work cooperatively with the Monitor to
resolve the matter to the satisfaction of the Monitor.

6. If the matter cannot be resolved, at the request of the Monitor, the Company shall
promptly provide written notice to the Monitor and the Section. Such notice shall include a
general description of the nature of the information, documents, records, facilities or current or
former employees that are being withheld, as well as the legal basis for withholding access. The
Section may then consider whether to make a further request for access to such information,
documents, records, facilities, or employees.

Monitorâs Coordination with the
Company and Review Methodology

7. In carrying out the Mandate, to the extent appropriate under the circumstances,
the Monitor should coordinate with Company personnel, including in-house counsel, compliance
personnel, and internal auditors, on an ongoing basis. The Monitor may rely on the product of
the Companyâs processes, such as the results of studies, reviews, sampling and testing
methodologies, audits, and analyses conducted by or on behalf of the Company, as well as the
Companyâs internal resources (e.g., legal, compliance, and internal audit), which can assist the
Monitor in carrying out the Mandate through increased efficiency and Company-specific
expertise, provided that the Monitor has confidence in the quality of those resources.

8. The Monitorâs reviews should use a risk-based approach, and thus, the Monitor is
not expected to conduct a comprehensive review of all business lines, all business activities, or
all markets. In carrying out the Mandate, the Monitor should consider, for instance, risks
presented by: (a) the countries and industries in which the Company operates; (b) current and

future business opportunities and transactions; (c) current and potential business partners,

D-3
 

Case O16-cr-60294-NC Document 2 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/24/2016 Page 53 of 59

including third parties and joint ventures, and the business rationale for such relationships; (d)
the Companyâs gifts, travel, and entertainment interactions with foreign officials; and (e) the
Companyâs involvement with foreign officials, including the amount of foreign government
regulation and oversight of the Company, such as licensing and permitting, and the Companyâs
exposure to customs and immigration issues in conducting its business affairs.

9, In undertaking the reviews to carry out the Mandate, the Monitor shall formulate
conclusions based on, among other things: (a) inspection of relevant documents, including the
Companyâs current anti-corruption policies and procedures; (b) on-site observation of selected
systems and procedures of the Company at sample sites, including internal accounting controls,
record-keeping, and internal audit procedures; (c) meetings with, and interviews of, relevant
current and, where appropriate, former directors, officers, employees, business partners, agents,
and other persons at mutually convenient times and places; and (d) analyses, studies, and testing
of the Companyâs compliance program.

Monitorâs Written Work Plans

10. To carry out the Mandate, during the Term of the Monitorship, the Monitor shall
conduct an initial review and prepare an initial report, followed by at least two follow-up reviews
and reports as described in Paragraphs 16-19 below. With respect to the initial report, after
consultation with the Company and the Section, the Monitor shall prepare the first written work
plan within thirty (30) calendar days of being retained and the Company and the Department
shall provide comments within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the written work plan.
With respect to each follow-up report, after consultation with the Company and the Section, the
Monitor shall prepare a written work plan at least sixty (60) calendar days prior to commencing a
review, and the Company and the Section shall provide comments within thirty (30) calendar

D-4
 

Case Or16-cr-60294-NC Document 2 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/24/2016 Page 54 of 59

days after receipt of the written work plan. Any disputes between the Company and the Monitor
with respect to any written work plan shall be decided by the Section in its sole discretion.

11. All written work plans shall identify with reasonable specificity the activities the
Monitor plans to undertake in execution of the Mandate, including a written request for
documents, The Monitorâs work plan for the initial review shall include such steps as are
reasonably necessary to conduct an effective initial review in accordance with the Mandate,
including by developing an understanding, to the extent the Monitor deems appropriate, of the
facts and circumstances surrounding any violations that may have occurred before the date of the
Agreement. In developing such understanding the Monitor is to rely to the extent possible on
available information and documents provided by the Company. It is not intended that the
Monitor will conduct his or her own inquiry into the historical events that gave rise to the
Agreement.

Initial Review

12. The initial review shall commence no later than one hundred twenty (120)
calendar days from the date of the engagement of the Monitor (unless otherwise agreed by the
Company, the Monitor, and the Section). The Monitor shall issue a written report within one
hundred twenty (120) calendar days of commencing the initial review, setting forth the Monitorâs
assessment and, if necessary, making recommendations reasonably designed to improve the
effectiveness of the Companyâs program for ensuring compliance with the anti-corruption laws.
The Monitor should consult with the Company concerning his or her findings and
recommendations on an ongoing basis and should consider the Companyâs comments and input
to the extent the Monitor deems appropriate. The Monitor may also choose to share a draft of his

or her reports with the Company prior to finalizing them. The Monitorâs reports need not recite

or describe comprehensively the Companyâs history or compliance policies, procedures and
practices, but rather may focus on those areas with respect to which the Monitor wishes to make
recommendations, if any, for improvement or which the Monitor otherwise concludes merit
particular attention. The Monitor shall provide the report to the Board of Directors of the
Company and contemporaneously transmit copies to the FCPA Chief, Fraud Section, Criminal
Division, U.S. Department of Justice, at 1400 New York Avenue N.W., Washington, D.C.

13. Within ninety (90) calendar days after receiving the Monitorâs initial report, the
Company shall adopt and implement all recommendations in the report, unless, within sixty (60)
calendar days of receiving the report, the Company notifies in writing the Monitor and the
Section of any recommendations that the Company considers unduly burdensome, inconsistent
with applicable law or regulation, impractical, excessively expensive, or otherwise inadvisable.
With respect to any such recommendation, the Company need not adopt that recommendation
within the one hundred and twenty (120) days of receiving the report but shall propose in writing
to the Monitor and the Section an alternative policy, procedure or system designed to achieve the
same objective or purpose. As to any recommendation on which the Company and the Monitor
do not agree, such parties shall attempt in good faith to reach an agreement within forty-five (45)
calendar days after the Company serves the written notice.

14. In the event the Company and the Monitor are unable to agree on an acceptable
alternative proposal, the Company shall promptly consult with the Section. The Section may
consider the Monitorâs recommendation and the Companyâs reasons for not adopting the

recommendation in determining whether the Company has fully complied with its obligations

hundred-twenty (120) calendar days of commencing the follow-up review, setting forth the
Monitorâs assessment and, if necessary, making recommendations in the same fashion as set

the Monitor may extend the time period for issuance of the follow-up report for a brief period of
time with prior written approval of the Section.

procedures described in Paragraphs 16-18. F ollowing the second follow-up review, the Monitor

is reasonably designed and implemented to prevent and detect violations of the anti-corruption
laws. The final follow-up review and report shall be completed and delivered to the Section no
later than thirty (30) days before the end of the Term.

Monitorâs Discovery of Potential or Actual Misconduct

20. (a) Except as set forth below in sub-paragraphs (b) and (c), should the
Monitor discover during the course of his or her engagement that:

e improper payments or anything else of value may have been offered,
promised, made, or authorized by any entity or person within the

D-8
 

Case O:16-cr-60294-NC Document 2 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/24/2016 Page 58 of 59

Company or any entity or person working, directly or indirectly, for or on
behalf of the Company; or

e the Company may have maintained false books, records or accounts; or
(collectively, âPotential Misconductâ), the Monitor shall immediately report the Potential
Misconduct to the Companyâs General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer, and/or Audit
Committee for further action, unless the Potential Misconduct was already so disclosed. The
Monitor also may report Potential Misconduct to the Section at any time, and shall report
Potential Misconduct to the Section when it requests the information.

(b) If the Monitor believes that any Potential Misconduct actually occurred or
may constitute a criminal or regulatory violation (âActual Misconductâ), the Monitor shall
immediately report the Actual Misconduct to the Section. When the Monitor discovers Actual
Misconduct, the Monitor shall disclose the Actual Misconduct solely to the Section, and, in such
cases, disclosure of the Actual Misconduct to the General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer,
and/or the Audit Committee of the Company should occur as the Section and the Monitor deem
appropriate under the circumstances.

(c) The Monitor shall address in his or her reports the appropriateness of the
Companyâs response to disclosed Potential Misconduct or Actual Misconduct, whether
previously disclosed to the Section or not. Further, if the Company or any entity or person
working directly or indirectly for or on behalf of the Company withholds information necessary
for the performance of the Monitorâs responsibilities and the Monitor believes that such
withholding is without just cause, the Monitor shall also immediately disclose that fact to the
Section and address the Companyâs failure to disclose the necessary information in his or her

reports.

(d) The Company nor anyone acting on its behalf shall take any action to
retaliate against the Monitor for any such disclosures or for any other reason.
Meetings During Pendency of Monitorship

providing each report to the Section to discuss the report, to be followed by a meeting between
the Section, the Monitor, and the Company.

22. At least annually, and more frequently if appropriate, representatives from the
Company and the Section will meet together to discuss the monitorship and any suggestions,
comments, or improvements the Company may wish to discuss with or propose to the Section,
including with respect to the scope or costs of the monitorship,

Contemplated Confidentiality of Monitorâs Reports

23. The reports will likely include proprietary, financial, confidential, and competitive
business information. Moreover, public disclosure of the reports could discourage cooperation,
or impede pending or potential government investigations and thus undermine the objectives of
the monitorship. For these reasons, among others, the reports and the contents thereof are
intended to remain and shall remain non-public, except as otherwise agreed to by the parties in
writing, or except to the extent that the Section determines in its sole discretion that disclosure
would be in furtherance of the Sectionâs discharge of its duties and responsibilities or is

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Monday, October 24, 2016

Embraer Agrees to Pay More than $107 Million to Resolve Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Charges

Parallel Resolutions with the Securities and Exchange Commission and Brazilian Authorities Equaling $97 Million in Disgorgement Also
Announced Today

Brazilian aircraft manufacturer Embraer S.A. (Embraer) entered into a resolution to resolve criminal charges and agreed to pay a penalty of
more than $107 million in connection with schemes involving the bribery of government officials in the Dominican Republic, Saudi Arabia and
Mozambique, and to pay millions more in falsely recorded payments in India via a sham agency agreement.

Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division and Assistant Special Agent in Charge William J.
Maddalena of the FBIâs Miami Field Office made the announcement.

âEmbraer paid millions of dollars in bribes to win government aircraft contracts in three different continents,â said Assistant Attorney General
Caldwell. âBut this prosecution shows that the Criminal Division will hold accountable those who treat corruption as a mere cost of doing
business. Between U.S., Brazilian and Saudi authorities, bribe payers and bribe takers alike have been brought to justice for their wrongdoing.â

âEmbraer tried to bribe their way into several profitable aircraft contracts around the world,â said Assistant Special Agent in Charge Maddalena.
âInstead of reaping a nice profit, their criminal conduct earned the Brazilian aircraft manufacturer a substantial penalty that more than wiped
out their gains from these contracts. Crime does not pay!â

According to the companyâs admissions, Embraer executives and employees paid bribes to government officials and falsified books and records
in connection with aircraft sales to foreign governments and state-owned entities in multiple countries. In 2008, Embraer paid $3.52 million to
an influential government official in the Dominican Republic via a false agency agreement to secure a contract to sell the Dominican Air Force
eight military aircraft for approximately $92 million. In 2010, Embraer paid $1.65 million to an official at a Saudi Arabian state-owned and -
controlled company via a false agency agreement to secure that instrumentalityâs agreement to purchase three aircraft from Embraer for
approximately $93 million. In 2008, Embraer paid $800,000 via a false agency agreement with an intermediary designated by a high-level
official at Mozambiqueâs state-owned commercial airline, Linhas AÃ©reas de Mocambique S.A. (LAM), to secure LAMâs agreement to purchase two
aircraft from Embraer for approximately $65 million. In 2009, Embraer paid an agent $5.76 million pursuant to a false agency agreement with a
shell company in connection with a contract it secured to sell the Indian Air Force three aircraft for approximately $208 million.

In total, Embraer earned profits of nearly $84 million on the foregoing aircraft sales.

Embraer entered into a three-year deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) to resolve the case. As part of the DPA, Embraer admitted to its
involvement in a conspiracy to violate the FCPAâs anti-bribery and books and records provisions and to its willful failure to implement an
adequate system of internal accounting controls. Embraer agreed to pay a criminal penalty of $107,285,090; continue to cooperate with the
department's investigation; enhance its compliance program; implement a more adequate system of internal accounting controls; and retain an
independent corporate compliance monitor for a term of three years.

The Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section reached this resolution based on a number of factors, including the fact that Embraer did not voluntarily
disclose the FCPA violations, but did cooperate with the department's investigation after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) served
it with a subpoena. After Embraer began cooperating, it did so fully and disclosed all relevant, non-privileged facts known to it, including about
individuals involved in the misconduct. Embraer did not, however, engage in full remediation. It disciplined a number of company employees
and executives engaged in the misconduct, but did not discipline a senior executive who was aware of bribery discussions in emails in 2004 and
had oversight responsibility for the employees engaged in those discussions. As a result, the criminal penalty in this case is 20 percent below
the bottom of the applicable range under the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines, a discount that reflects Embraerâs full cooperation but incomplete
remediation.

In related matters, Embraer reached settlements with both the SEC and Brazilian authorities. Embraer reached a settlement with the SEC,
under which it agreed to pay $83.8 million in disgorgement and $14.4 million in prejudgment interest. The SEC has agreed to credit the
disgorgement that Embraer pays to Brazilian authorities. Embraer also reached a settlement with Brazilian authorities under which it agreed to
pay $20 million in disgorgement. With the cooperation of U.S. authorities, Brazilian authorities have charged 11 individuals for their alleged
involvement in Embraerâs misconduct in the Dominican Republic. Saudi Arabian authorities have charged two individuals for their alleged
involvement in Embraerâs misconduct in Saudi Arabia.

The FBIâs Miami Field Office investigated the case. Senior Trial Attorney Jason Linder and Trial Attorney John-Alex Romano of the Criminal
Divisionâs Fraud Section prosecuted the case.

The Fraud Section appreciates the cooperation and assistance provided by the SEC in this matter. Authorities in Brazil, the Dominican Republic
and South Africa also provided assistance and cooperation. The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs also provided assistance
during the investigation.

The Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the

departmentâs FCPA enforcement efforts can be found at www. justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.

Re: = United States v. Ericsson Egypt Ltd.

 

Dear Counsel:

Pursuant to Rule 11(c)(1)(C) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the United States
of America, by and through the Department of Justice, Criminal Division, Fraud Section (the
âFraud Sectionâ) and the Office of the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New
York (the âOfficeâ) (collectively, the âUnited Statesâ), and the Defendant, Ericsson Egypt Ltd.
(âEricsson Egyptâ or the âDefendantâ), by and through its undersigned attorneys, and through its
authorized representative, pursuant to authority granted by the Defendantâs shareholders, hereby
submit and enter into this plea agreement (the âAgreementâ). The terms and conditions of this
Agreement are as follows:

The Defendantâs Agreement
1. Pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(c)(1)(C), the Defendant agrees to waive its right to

grand jury indictment and its right to challenge venue in the District Court for the Southern District

1
of New York, and to plead guilty to a one-count criminal Information charging the Defendant with
conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States, in violation of Title 18, United States
Code, Section 371, that is, to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act of 1977 (âFCPAâ), as amended, see Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-1. The
Defendant further agrees to persist in that plea through sentencing and, as set forth below, to
cooperate fully with the Fraud Section and the Office in their investigation into the conduct
described in this Agreement and other conduct related to the conduct described in this Agreement
and the Statement of Facts attached hereto as Exhibit 2 (the âStatement of Factsâ).

2. The Defendant understands that, to be guilty of this offense, the following
essential elements of the offense must be satisfied:

Count One

a. The agreement specified in the Information, and not some other agreement

or agreements, existed between at least two people to violate the anti-bribery provision of

the FCPA;
b. the Defendant willfully joined in that agreement; and
& one of the conspirators committed an overt act during the period of the

conspiracy to effect the object of the conspiracy.

3 The Defendant understands and agrees that this Agreement is between the Fraud
Section and the Office and the Defendant and does not bind any other division or section of the
Department of Justice or any other federal, state, or local prosecuting, administrative, or regulatory
authority. Nevertheless, the Fraud Section and the Office will bring this Agreement and the nature
and quality of the conduct, cooperation and remediation of the Defendant and its direct or indirect

affiliates, parent companies, subsidiaries, and joint ventures, to the attention of other prosecuting
Z
authorities or other agencies, as well as debarment authorities and Multilateral Development Banks
(âMDBsâ), if requested by the Defendant.

4, The Defendant agrees that this Agreement will be executed by an authorized
corporate representative. The Defendant further agrees that a resolution duly adopted by the
Defendantâs shareholders in the form attached to this Agreement as Exhibit 1 authorizes the
Defendant to enter into this Agreement and take all necessary steps to effectuate this Agreement,
and that the signatures on this Agreement by the Defendant and its counsel are authorized by the
Defendantâs shareholders, on behalf of the Defendant.

5, The Defendant agrees that it has the full legal right, power, and authority to enter
into and perform all of its obligations under this Agreement.

6. The Fraud Section and the Office enter into this Agreement based on the individual
facts and circumstances presented by this case and Ericsson Egyptâs parent company,
Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson (the âParent Companyâ), including:

a. The Parent Company entered into a deferred prosecution agreement (the
âDPAâ) simultaneously to the Defendant entering its guilty plea;

b, The Parent Company has agreed to pay a total criminal monetary penalty of
$520,650,432 to the United States Treasury relating to the same conduct;

C. The Parent Company and the Defendant did not receive voluntary
disclosure credit pursuant to the FCPA Corporate Enforcement Policy in the Department of Justice
Manual (âJMâ) 9-47.120, or pursuant to the United States Sentencing Guidelines (âU.S.S.G.â or
âSentencing Guidelinesâ), because they did not voluntarily self-disclose to the Fraud Section and

the Office the conduct described in the Statement of Facts;
d. The Parent Company and the Defendant received partial credit for their
cooperation with the Fraud Sectionâs and the Officeâs investigation pursuant to the FCPA
Corporate Enforcement Policy, JM 9-47.120, because they conducted a thorough internal
investigation; made regular factual presentations to the Fraud Section and the Office; provided
facts learned during witness interviews conducted by the Parent Company; voluntarily made
foreign-based employees available for interviews in the United States; produced extensive
documentation, including documents located outside of the United States as well as translations of
foreign language documents; and proactively disclosed some conduct of which the Fraud Section
and the Office were previously unaware;

a. The Parent Company and the Defendant did not receive full credit for
cooperation and remediation pursuant to the FCPA Corporate Enforcement Policy, JM 9-47.120,
because the Parent Company did not disclose allegations of corruption with respect to two relevant
matters, produced certain relevant materials in an untimely manner, and did not timely and fully
remediate, including by failing to take adequate disciplinary measures with respect to certain
executives and other employees involved in the conduct;

- Although the Parent Company and the Defendant had inadequate anti-
corruption controls and an inadequate anti-corruption compliance program during the period of
the conduct described in the Statement of Facts, the Parent Company has been enhancing and has
committed to continuing to enhance its compliance program and internal accounting controls,
including ensuring that its compliance program satisfies the minimum elements set forth in
Attachment C to the DPA;

g. Because the Parent Company has not yet fully implemented or tested its

compliance program, the Parent Company has agreed to the imposition of an independent
4
compliance monitor to reduce the risk of misconduct, including at its subsidiaries including the
Defendant, as set forth in Attachment D to the DPA;

h. The nature and seriousness of the offense conduct, including the payment
of bribes to high-level government officials in Djibouti, as well as significant books and records
and internal controls violations in Djibouti, China, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Kuwait, over a period
of years which included the involvement of high-level executives at the Parent Company;

1. The Parent Company and the Defendant have no prior criminal history; and

is The Parent Company and the Defendant have agreed to continue to
cooperate with the Fraud Section and the Office in any ongoing investigation as described in
Paragraph 9 below;

k. The Parent Company has agreed to resolve with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (âSECâ) through a civil complaint and injunction that will be filed on
December 6, 2019, relating to the conduct described in the Statement of Facts, as well as conduct
in Saudi Arabia, and has agreed to pay $458,380,000 in disgorgement and $81,540,000 in pre-
judgment interest. |

l. Accordingly, after considering (a) through (j) above, the Fraud Section and
the Office believe the appropriate resolution in this case is a deferred prosecution agreement with
the Parent Company; a criminal monetary penalty of $520,650,432, which reflects an aggregate
discount of fifteen percent off of the bottom of the otherwise-applicable U.S. Sentencing
Guidelines fine range and which includes a criminal fine against the Defendant of $9,520,000 to
be paid by the Parent Company on behalf of Ericsson Egypt; the imposition of an independent

compliance monitor; and this guilty plea by Ericsson Egypt.
ve The Defendant agrees to abide by all terms and obligations of this Agreement as

described herein, including, but not limited to, the following:

a. to plead guilty as set forth in this Agreement,
b. to abide by all sentencing stipulations contained in this Agreement;
e, to appear, through its duly appointed representatives, as ordered for all court

appearances, and obey any other ongoing court order in this matter, consistent with all applicable

U.S. and foreign laws, procedures, and regulations;

d. to commit no further crimes;
e. to be truthful at all times with the Court;
i@ to pay the applicable fine and special assessment; and

g. to work with the Parent Company in fulfilling the obligations of the DPA.

8. Except as may otherwise be agreed by the parties in connection with a particular
transaction, the Defendant agrees that in the event that, during the term of the Parent Company
DPA (the âTermâ), the Defendant undertakes any change in corporate form, including if it sells,
merges, or transfers business operations that are material to the Defendantâs consolidated
operations, or to the operations of any subsidiaries or affiliates involved in the conduct described
in the Statement of Facts, as they exist as of the date of this Agreement, whether such sale is
structured as a sale, asset sale, merger, transfer, or other change in corporate form, it shall include
in any contract for sale, merger, transfer, or other change in corporate form a provision binding
the purchaser, or any successor in interest thereto, to the obligations described in this
Agreement. The purchaser or successor in interest must also agree in writing that the Fraud
Section and the Officeâs ability to declare a breach under this Agreement is applicable in full force

to that entity. The Defendant agrees that the failure to include these provisions in the transaction
6
will make any such transaction null and void. The Defendant shall provide notice to the Fraud
Section and the Office at least thirty days prior to undertaking any such sale, merger, transfer, or
other change in corporate form. The Fraud Section and the Office shall notify the Defendant prior
to such transaction (or series of transactions) if it determines that the transaction(s) will have the
effect of circumventing or frustrating the enforcement purposes of this Agreement. If at any time
during the Term the Defendant engages in a transaction(s) that has the effect of circumventing or
frustrating the enforcement purposes of this Agreement, the Fraud Section and the Office may
deem it a breach of this Agreement pursuant to Paragraphs 22-25 of this Agreement. Nothing
herein shall restrict the Defendant from indemnifying (or otherwise holding harmless) the
purchaser or successor in interest for penalties or other costs arising from any conduct that may
have occurred prior to the date of the transaction, so long as such indemnification does not have
the effect of circumventing or frustrating the enforcement purposes of this Agreement, as
determined by the Fraud Section and the Office.

9. The Defendant shall cooperate fully with the Fraud Section and the Office in any
and all matters relating to the conducted described in this Agreement and the Statement of Facts,
and other conduct under investigation by the Fraud Section and the Office at any time during the
Term, subject to applicable laws and regulations, until the later of the date upon which all
investigations and prosecutions arising out of such conduct are concluded, or the end of the Term.
At the request of the Fraud Section or the Office, the Defendant shall also cooperate fully with
other domestic or foreign law enforcement and regulatory authorities and agencies, as well as the
Multilateral Development Banks (âMDBsâ), in any investigation of the Defendant, the Parent
Company or its affiliates, or any of its present or former officers, directors, employees, agents, and

consultants, or any other party, in any and all matters relating to the conduct described in this
7
Agreement and the Statement of Facts. The Defendantâs cooperation pursuant to this Paragraph
is subject to applicable laws and regulations, including data privacy and national security laws and
regulations, as well as valid claims of attorney-client privilege or attorney work product doctrine;
however, the Parent Company must provide to the Fraud Section and the Office a log of any
information or cooperation that is not provided based on an assertion of law, regulation, or
privilege, and the Parent Company bears the burden of establishing the validity of any such
assertion. The Defendant agrees that its cooperation pursuant to this paragraph shall include, but
not be limited to, the following:

a. The Defendant shall truthfully disclose all factual information with respect
to its activities, those of its parent company and affiliates, and those of its present and former
directors, officers, employees, agents, and consultants, including any evidence or allegations and
internal or external investigations, about which the Defendant has any knowledge or about which
the Fraud Section and the Office may inquire. This obligation of truthful disclosure includes, but
is not limited to, the obligation of the Defendant to provide to the Fraud Section and the Office,
upon request, any document, record, or other tangible evidence about which the Fraud Section and
the Office may inquire of the Defendant. |

b. Upon request of the Fraud Section and the Office, the Defendant shall
designate knowledgeable employees, agents, or stomeys to provide to the Fraud Section and the
Office the information and materials described in Paragraph 9(a) above on behalf of the Defendant.
It is further understood that the Defendant must at all times provide complete, truthful, and accurate
information.

e. The Defendant shall use its best efforts to make available for interviews or

testimony, as requested by the Fraud Section and the Office, present or former officers, directors,
8
employees, agents and consultants of the Defendant. This obligation includes, but is not limited
to, sworn testimony before a federal grand jury or in federal trials, all meetings requested by the
Fraud Section and the Office, and interviews with domestic or foreign law enforcement and
regulatory authorities. Cooperation under this Paragraph shall include identification of witnesses
who, to the knowledge of the Defendant, may have material information regarding the matters
being investigated or prosecuted.

d. With respect to any information, testimony, documents, records, or other
tangible evidence provided to the Fraud Section and the Office pursuant to this Agreement, the
Defendant consents to any and all disclosures, subject to applicable law and regulations, to other
governmental authorities, including United States authorities and those of a foreign government,
as well as the MDBs, of such materials as the Fraud Section and the Office, in their sole discretion,
shall deem appropriate.

10. During the term of the cooperation obligations provided for in the Paragraph 9 of
the Agreement, should the Defendant learn of any evidence or allegation of conduct that may
constitute a violation of the FCPA anti-bribery or accounting provisions had the conduct occurred
within the jurisdiction of the United States, the Defendant shall promptly report such evidence or
allegation to the Fraud Section and the Office. Thirty days prior to the end of the term of the
cooperation obligations provided for in Paragraph 9 of the Agreement, the Defendant, through an
appropriate senior executive, will certify to the Fraud Section and the Office that the Defendant
has met its disclosure obligations pursuant to Paragraph 9 and this Paragraph. Each certification
will be deemed a material statement and representation by the Defendant to the executive branch
of the United States for purposes of 18 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1001 and 1519, and it will be deemed to have

been made in the judicial district in which this Agreement is filed.
9
11. The Defendant agrees that any fine or restitution imposed by the Court will be due
and payable in full within ten days of the entry of judgment following such sentencing hearing,
and the Defendant will not attempt to avoid or delay payment. The Defendant further agrees to
pay the Clerk of the Court for the United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York the mandatory special assessment of $400 per count within ten business days from the date
of sentencing.

The United Statesâ Agreement

12. In exchange for the guilty plea of the Defendant and the complete fulfillment of all
of its obligations under this Agreement, the Fraud Section and the Office agree they will not file
additional criminal charges against the Defendant, the Parent Company, or any of its direct or
indirect affiliates, subsidiaries, or joint ventures relating to any of the conduct described in the
Statement of Facts, except as set forth in the DPA. This Paragraph does not provide any protection
against prosecution for any crimes, including corrupt payments or related false books and records
and failure to implement adequate internal controls, made in the future by the Defendant, by the
Parent Company, or by any of their officers, directors, employees, agents, or consultants, whether
or not disclosed by the Defendant pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. This Agreement does
not close or preclude the investigation or prosecution of any natural persons, including any
officers, directors, employees, agents, or consultants of the Defendant, the Parent Company or
their direct or indirect affiliates, subsidiaries, or joint ventures, who may have been involved in
any of the matters set forth in the Information, the Statement of Facts, or in any other matters. The
Defendant agrees that nothing in this Agreement is intended to release the Defendant from any of
the Defendantâs excise and income tax liabilities and reporting obligations for any and all income

not properly reported and/or legally or illegally obtained or derived.
10
Factual Basis

13. The Defendant is pleading guilty because it is guilty of the charge contained in the
Information. The Defendant admits, agrees, and stipulates that the factual allegations set forth in
the Information and the Statement of Facts are true and correct, that it is responsible for the acts
of its officers, directors, employees, and agents described in the Information and the Statement of
Facts, and that the Information and the Statement of Facts accurately reflect the Defendantâs
criminal conduct.

The Defendantâs Waiver of Rights, Including the Right to Appeal

14. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(f) and Federal Rule of Evidence 410 limit
the admissibility of statements made in the course of plea proceedings or plea discussions in both
civil and criminal proceedings, if the guilty plea is later withdrawn. The Defendant expressly
warrants that it has discussed these rules with its counsel and understands them. Solely to the
extent set forth below, the Defendant voluntarily waives and gives up the rights enumerated in
Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(f) and Federal Rule of Evidence 410. Specifically, the
Defendant understands and agrees that any statements that it makes in the course of its guilty plea
or in connection with the Agreement are admissible against it for any purpose in any U.S. federal
criminal proceeding if, even though the Fraud Section and the Office have fulfilled all of their
obligations under this Agreement and the Court has imposed the agreed-upon sentence, the
Defendant nevertheless withdraws its guilty plea.

15. | The Defendant is satisfied that the Defendantâs attorneys have rendered effective
assistance. The Defendant understands that by entering into this agreement, the Defendant
surrenders certain rights as provided in this agreement. The Defendant understands that the rights

of criminal defendants include the following:
11
(a) the right to plead not guilty and to persist in that plea;

(b) the right to a jury trial;

(c) the right to be represented by counsel â and if necessary have the court appoint
counsel â at trial and at every other stage of the proceedings;

(d) the right at trial to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses, to be protected
from compelled self-incrimination, to testify and present evidence, and to compel the attendance
of witnesses; and

(e) pursuant to Title 18, United States Code, Section 3742, the right to appeal the
sentence imposed.

Nonetheless, the Defendant knowingly waives the right to appeal or collaterally attack the
conviction and any sentence within the statutory maximum described below (or the manner in
which that sentence was determined) on the grounds set forth in Title 18, United States Code,
Section 3742, or on any ground whatsoever except those specifically excluded in this Paragraph,
in exchange for the concessions made by the United States in this plea agreement. This agreement
does not affect the rights or obligations of the United States as set forth in Title 18, United States
Code, Section 3742(b). The Defendant also knowingly waives the right to bring any collateral
challenge challenging either the conviction or the sentence imposed in this case. The Defendant
hereby waives all rights, whether asserted directly or by a representative, to request or receive from
any department or agency of the United States any records pertaining to the investigation or
prosecution of this case, including without limitation any records that may be sought under the
Freedom of Information Act, Title 5, United States Code, Section 552, or the Privacy Act, Title 5,
United States Code, Section 552a. The Defendant waives all defenses based on the statute of

limitations and venue with respect to any prosecution related to the conduct described in the
12
Statement of Facts or the Information, including any prosecution that is not time-barred on the date
that this Agreement is signed in the event that: (a) the conviction is later vacated for any reason;
(b) the Defendant violates this Agreement; or (c) the plea is later withdrawn, provided such
prosecution is brought within one year of any such vacation of conviction, violation of agreement,
or withdrawal of plea plus the remaining time period of the statute of limitations as of the date that
this Agreement is signed. The Fraud Section and the Office are free to take any position on appeal
or any other post-judgment matter. The parties agree that any challenge to the Defendantâs
sentence that is not foreclosed by this Paragraph will be limited to that portion of the sentencing
calculation that is inconsistent with (or not addressed by) this waiver. Nothing in the foregoing
waiver of appellate and collateral review rights shall preclude the Defendant from raising a claim
of ineffective assistance of counsel in an appropriate forum.
Penalty

16. The statutory maximum sentence that the Court can impose for the offense charged
in the Information is a fine of $500,000, or twice the gross gain or gross loss resulting from the
offense, whichever is the greatest, see 18 U.S.C. 3571(c)(3) & (d); five yearsâ probation, see Title
18, United States Code, Section 3561(c)(1); restitution in the amount of any victimsâ losses as
ordered by the Court. and a mandatory special assessment of $400 per count, see Title 18, United
States Code, Section 3013(a)(2)(B). In this case, the parties agree that the gross pecuniary gain
resulting from the offense is $7,000,000. Therefore, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Â§ 3571(d), the
maximum fine that may be imposed is $14,000,000 per offense, or in this case a total of

$14,000,000.

13
Sentencing Recommendation

17. The parties agree that pursuant to United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005), the
Court must determine an advisory sentencing guideline range pursuant to the United States
Sentencing Guidelines. The Court will then determine a reasonable sentence within the statutory
range after considering the advisory sentencing guideline range and the factors listed in Title 18,
United States Code, Section 3553(a). The partiesâ agreement herein to any guideline sentencing
factors constitutes proof of those factors sufficient to satisfy fhe apelinabite burden of proof. The
Defendant also understands that if the Court accepts this Agreement, the Court is bound by the
sentencing provisions in Paragraph 16.

18. The Fraud Section and the Office and the Defendant agree that a faithful application
of the Sentencing Guidelines to determine the applicable fine range yields the following analysis:

a. The 2018 version of the U.S.S.G. is applicable to this matter.

b. Offense Level. Based upon U.S.S.G. Â§ 2C1.1, the total offense level is 36,
calculated as follows:

(a)(2) Base Offense Level . 12
(b)(1) More than one bribe 4D

(b)(2) Value of benefit received ($7,000,000) is greater
than $3,500,000 but not more than $9,500,000 +18

(b)(3) Public official in a high-level decision-making
position +4

TOTAL 36

C. Base Fine. Based upon U.S.S.G. Â§ 8C2.4(a)(1), the base fine is
$80,000,000

d. Culpability Score. Based upon U.S.S.G. Â§ 8C2.5, the culpability score is
6, calculated as follows:
14
(a) Base Culpability Score 2

(b)(3) the unit of the organization within which the offense
was committed had 200 or more employees and an
individual within high-level personnel of the unit
participated in, condoned, or was willfully ignorant
of the offense +3

(g)(2) The organization fully cooperated in the
investigation and clearly demonstrated recognition
and affirmative acceptance of responsibility for the
criminal conduct -2

TOTAL 6

Calculation of Fine Range:

Base Fine $80,000,000

Multipliers 1.20 (min)/2.40 (max)

Fine Range $96,000,000 (min)/
$192,000,000 (max)

19. Pursuant to Rule 11(c)(1)(C) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Fraud
Section and the Office and the Defendant agree that the following represents the appropriate
disposition of the case:

a. Disposition. Pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(c)(1)(C), the Fraud Section,
the Office, and the Defendant agree that the appropriate disposition of this case is as set forth
above, and agree to recommend jointly that the Court at a hearing to be scheduled at an agreed
upon time impose a sentence requiring the Defendant to pay a criminal fine of $9,520,000, payable,
in full within ten business days of such sentencing hearing (âthe Recommended Sentenceâ). The
parties agree that the Recommended Sentence is appropriate in light of the Parent Company DPA,

which relates to, among other conduct, the same conduct to which the Defendant is pleading guilty,
15
and which requires the Parent Company to pay a total criminal fine of $520,650,432 as a result of
the misconduct committed by both the Parent Company and the Defendant, as well as the factors
cited in the DPA. As described in the DPA, the Recommended Sentence shall be deducted from
the $520,650,432 total criminal monetary penalty and shall be paid by the Parent Company.

b. The Defendant shall not seek or accept, directly or indirectly,
reimbursement or indemnification from any source, other than the Parent Company, with regard
to the fine, forfeiture, or disgorgement amounts that the Defendant pays pursuant to the Agreement
or any other agreement entered into with an enforcement authority or regulator concerning the
facts set forth in the Statement of Facts. The Defendant further acknowledges that no tax deduction
may be sought in connection with the payment of any part of this $9,520,000 criminal fine. The
Fraud Section and the Office believe that a disposition that includes $9,520,000 criminal fine is
appropriate based on the factors outlined in Paragraph 6 of this Agreement and those set forth in
18 U.S.C. Â§ 3553(a).

oe Mandatory Special Assessment. The Defendant shall pay to the Clerk of

 

the Court for the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York within ten
days of the time of sentencing the mandatory special assessment of $400 per count.

d. Restitution. As of the date of the Agreement, the Fraud Section, the Office
and the Defendant have not identified any victim qualifying for restitution and thus are not
requesting an order of restitution. The Defendant recognizes and agrees, however, that restitution
is imposed at the sole discretion of the Court. The Defendant agrees to pay restitution as part of
the Agreement in the event restitution is ordered by the Court.

20. This Agreement is presented to the Court pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(Â¢)(1)(C).

The Defendant understands that, if the Court rejects this Agreement, the Court must: (a) inform
16
the parties that the Court rejects the Agreement; (b) advise the Defendantâs counsel that the Court
is not required to follow the Agreement and afford the Defendant the opportunity to withdraw its
plea; and (c) advise the Defendant that if the plea is not withdrawn, the Court may dispose of the
case less favorably toward the Defendant than the Agreement contemplated. The Defendant
further understands that if the Court refuses to accept any provision of this Agreement, neither
party shall be bound by the provisions of the Agreement.

21. The Fraud Section, the Office, and the Defendant waive the preparation of a Pre-
Sentence Investigation Report (âPSRâ) and intend to seek a sentencing by the Court immediately
following the Rule 11 hearing in the absence of a PSR. The Defendant understands that the
decision whether to proceed with the sentencing proceeding without a PSR is exclusively that of
the Court. In the event the Court directs the preparation of a Presentence Investigation Report, the
Fraud Section and the Office will fully inform the preparer of the Presentence Investigation Report
and the Court of the facts and law related to the Defendantâs case. At the time of the plea hearing,
the parties will suggest mutually agreeable and convenient dates for the sentencing hearing with
adequate time for (a) any objections to the Presentence Report, and (b) consideration by the Court
of the Presentence Report and the partiesâ sentencing submissions.

Breach of Agreement

22. If, during the Term, the Defendant (a) commits any felony under U.S. federal law;
(b) provides in connection with this Agreement deliberately false, incomplete, or misleading
information; (c) fails to cooperate as set forth in Paragraphs 9 and 10 of this Agreement; (d)
commits any acts that, had they occurred within the jurisdictional reach of FCPA, would be a
violation of the FCPA; or (e) otherwise fails specifically to perform or to fulfill completely each

of the Defendantâs obligations under the Agreement, regardless of whether the Fraud Section and
17
the Office become aware of such a breach after the term specified in the Parent Company DPA,
the Defendant shall thereafter be subject to prosecution for any federal criminal violation of which
the Fraud Section and the Office have knowledge, including, but not limited to, the charge in the
Information described in Paragraph 1, which may be pursued by the Office in the U.S. District
Court for the Southern District of New York or any other appropriate venue. Determination of
whether the Defendant has breached the Agreement and whether to pursue prosecution of the
Defendant shall be in the Fraud Section and the Officeâs sole discretion. Any such prosecution
may be premised on information provided by the Defendant. Any such prosecution relating to the
conduct described in the attached Statement of Facts or relating to conduct known to the Fraud
Section and the Office prior to the date on which this Agreement was signed that is not time-barred
by the applicable statute of limitations on the date of the signing of this Agreement may be
commenced against the Defendant, notwithstanding the expiration of the statute of limitations,
between the signing of this Agreement and the expiration of the Term plus one year. Thus, by
signing this Agreement, the Defendant agrees that the statute of limitations with respect to any
such prosecution that is not time-barred on the date of the signing of this Agreement shall be tolled
for the term described the DPA plus one year. The Defendant gives up all defenses based on the
statute of limitations, any claim of pre-indictment delay, or any speedy trial claim with respect to
any such prosecution or action, except to the extent that such defenses existed as of the date of the
signing of this Agreement. In addition, the Defendant agrees that the statute of limitations as to
any violation of federal law that occurs during the term of the cooperation obligations provided
for in Paragraph 9 of the Agreement will be tolled from the date upon which the violation occurs

until the earlier of the date upon which the Fraud Section and the Office are made aware of the

18
violation or the duration of the term plus five years, and that this period shall be excluded from
any calculation of time for purposes of the application of the statute of limitations.

23. In the event the Fraud Section and the Office determine that the Defendant has
breached this Agreement, the Fraud Section and the Office agree to provide the Defendant with
written notice of such breach prior to instituting any prosecution resulting from such breach.
Within thirty days of receipt of such notice, the Defendant shall have the opportunity to respond
to the Fraud Section and the Office in writing to explain the nature and circumstances of such
breach, as well as the actions the Defendant has taken to address and remediate the situation, which
explanation the Fraud Section and the Office shall consider in determining whether to pursue
prosecution of the Defendant.

24. Inthe event that the Fraud Section and the Office determine that the Defendant has
breached this Agreement: (a) all statements made by or on behalf of the Defendant to the Fraud
Section and the Office or to the Court, including the attached Statement of Facts, and any testimony
given by the Defendant before a grand jury, a court, or any tribunal, or at any legislative hearings,
whether prior or subsequent to this Agreement, and any leads derived from such statements or
testimony, shall be admissible in evidence in any and all criminal proceedings brought by the Fraud
Section and the Office against the Defendant; and (b) the Defendant shall not assert any claim
under the United States Constitution, Rule 11(f) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rule
410 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, or any other federal rule that any such statements or
testimony made by or on behalf of the Defendant prior or subsequent to this Agreement, or any
leads derived therefrom, should be suppressed or are otherwise inadmissible. The decision
whether conduct or statements of any current director, officer, or employee, or any person acting

on behalf of, or at the direction of, the Defendant, will be imputed to the Defendant for the purpose
19
of determining whether the Defendant has violated any provision of this Agreement shall be in the
sole discretion of the Fraud Section and the Office.

25. The Defendant acknowledges that the Fraud Section and the Office have made no
representations, assurances, or promises concerning what sentence may be imposed by the Court
if the Defendant breaches this Agreement and this matter proceeds to judgment. The Defendant
further acknowledges that any such sentence is solely within the discretion of the Court and that
nothing in this Agreement binds or restricts the Court in the exercise of such discretion.

Public Statements by the Defendant

26. The Defendant expressly agrees that it shall not, through present or future
attorneys, officers, directors, employees, agents, or any other person authorized to speak for the
Defendant make any public statement, in litigation or otherwise, contradicting the acceptance of
responsibility by the Defendant set forth above or the facts described in the Information and the
Statement of Facts. Any such contradictory statement shall, subject to cure rights of the Defendant
described below, constitute a breach of this Agreement, and the Defendant thereafter shall be
subject to prosecution as set forth in Paragraphs 22-25 of this Agreement. The decision whether
any public statement by any such person contradicting a fact contained in the Information or the
Statement of Facts will be imputed to the Defendant for the purpose of determining whether it has
breached this Agreement shall be at the sole discretion of the Fraud Section and the Office. If the
Fraud Section and the Office determine that a public statement by any such person contradicts in
whole or in part a statement contained in the Information or the Statement of Facts, the Fraud
Section and the Office shall so notify the Defendant, and the Defendant may avoid a breach of this
Agreement by publicly repudiating such statement(s) within five business days after notification.

The Defendant shall be permitted to raise defenses and to assert affirmative claims in other
20
proceedings relating to the matters set forth in the Information and the Statement of Facts provided
that such defenses and claims do not contradict, in whole or in part, a statement contained in the
Information or the Statement of Facts. This Paragraph does not apply to any statement made by
any present or former officer, director, employee, or agent of the Defendant in the course of any
criminal, regulatory, or civil case initiated against such individual, unless such individual is
speaking on behalf of the Defendant.

Zi. The Defendant agrees that if it or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries or
affiliates issues a press release or holds any press conference in connection with this Agreement,
the Defendant shall first consult the Fraud Section and the Office to determine (a) whether the text
of the release or proposed statements at the press conference are true and accurate with respect to
matters between the Fraud Section and the Office and the Defendant; and (b) whether the Fraud

Section and the Office have any objection to the release or statement.

21
Complete Agreement

28. This document states the full extent of the Agreement between the parties. There
are no other promises or agreements, express or implied. Any modification of this Agreement
shall be valid only if set forth in writing in a supplemental or revised plea agreement signed by all

parties.

EXHIBIT 2
STATEMENT OF FACTS

The following Statement of Facts is incorporated by reference as part of the Plea
Agreement between the United States Department of Justice, Criminal Division, Fraud Section
(the âFraud Sectionâ), the United States Attorneyâs Office for the Southern District of New York
(the âOfficeâ) (collectively, the âUnited Statesâ), and the defendant Ericsson Egypt Ltd.
(âEricsson Egyptâ). Ericsson Egypt admits, accepts, and acknowledges that it is responsible for
the acts of its officers, directors, employees, and agents as set forth below. Had this matter
proceeded to trial, Ericsson Egypt acknowledges that the United States would have proven
beyond a reasonable doubt, by admissible evidence, the facts alleged below and set forth in the

Overview of the Djibouti Bribery Scheme
13. In or about and between 2010 and 2014, LM Ericsson, through certain of
its agents, including Ericsson Egypt, Ericsson AB, Employee 1, Employee 2, Employee 3,
Employee 4, and others knowingly and willfully conspired and agreed with others to corruptly
provide approximately $2,100,000 in bribe payments to, and for the benefit of, foreign officials
in Djibouti, including Foreign Official 1, Foreign Official 2, and Foreign Official 3, in order to
secure an improper advantage in order to obtain and retain business with Telecom Company and
to win a contract valued at approximately â¬20,300,000 with Telecom Company (the âTelecom
Company Contractâ).

14. In order to conceal the true nature of the approximately $2,100,000 in
bribe payments, Employee 2 completed a draft due diligence report that failed to disclose the
âspousal relationship between the owner of Consulting Company and Foreign Official 2. Further,
certain agents of LM Ericsson caused Ericsson ABâs branch office in Ethiopia to enter into a
sham contract with Consulting Company and to approve fake invoices in order to further conceal
the bribe payments.

15. In furtherance of the scheme, conspirators, including Employee 2 and
Foreign Official 2, used U.S.-based email accounts to communicate with each other and other
individuals about the scheme.

16. In addition, the $2,100,000 in bribe payments that LM Ericsson, through
certain of its agents, including Ericsson AB, ERICSSON EGYPT, and an employee of
ERICSSON EGYPT made and caused to be made to Consulting Company were routed into and

out of correspondent bank accounts at financial institutions in New York, New York.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Friday, December 6, 2019

Ericsson Agrees to Pay Over $1 Billion to Resolve FCPA Case

Ericsson Subsidiary Pleads Guilty to FCPA Violations

Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson (Ericsson or the Company), a multinational telecommunications company headquartered in Stockholm,
Sweden, has agreed to pay total penalties of more than $1 billion to resolve the governmentâs investigation into violations of the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) arising out of the Companyâs scheme to make and improperly record tens of millions of dollars in improper
payments around the world. This includes a criminal penalty of over $520 million and approximately $540 million to be paid to the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in a related matter. An Ericsson subsidiary pleaded guilty today for its role in the scheme.

Ericsson entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the department in connection with a criminal information filed today in the
Southern District of New York charging the Company with conspiracies to violate the anti-bribery, books and records, and internal controls
provisions of the FCPA. The Ericsson subsidiary, Ericsson Egypt Ltd, pleaded guilty today in the Southern District of New York to a one-count
criminal information charging it with conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA. The case is assigned to U.S. District Judge
Alison J. Nathan of the Southern District of New York. Pursuant to its agreement with the department, Ericsson has committed to pay a total
criminal penalty of $520,650,432 within 10 business days of the sentencing hearing, and has agreed to the imposition of an independent
compliance monitor.

âEricssonâs corrupt conduct involved high-level executives and spanned 17 years and at least five countries, all in a misguided effort to increase
profits,â said Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division. âSuch wrongdoing called for a
strong response from law enforcement, and through a tenacious effort with our partners in the Southern District of New York, the SEC, and the
IRS, todayâs action not only holds Ericsson accountable for these schemes, but should deter other companies from engaging in similar criminal
conduct.â

âToday, Swedish telecom giant Ericsson has admitted to a years-long campaign of corruption in five countries to solidify its grip on
telecommunications business,â said U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman of the Southern District of New York. âThrough slush funds, bribes, gifts,
and graft, Ericsson conducted telecom business with the guiding principle that âmoney talks.â Todayâs guilty plea and surrender of over a billion
dollars in combined penalties should communicate clearly to all corporate actors that doing business this way will not be tolerated.â

âImplementing strong compliance systems and internal controls are basic principles that international companies must follow to steer clear of
illegal activity,â said Don Fort, Chief, IRS Criminal Investigation. âEricssonâs shortcomings in these areas made it easier for its executives and
employees to pay bribes and falsify its books and records. We will continue to pursue cases such as these in order to preserve a global
commerce system free of corruption.â

According to admissions by Ericsson, beginning in 2000 and continuing until 2016, the Company conspired with others to violate the FCPA by
engaging in a longstanding scheme to pay bribes, to falsify books and records and to fail to implement reasonable internal accounting controls.
Ericsson used third party agents and consultants to make bribe payments to government officials and/or to manage off-the-books slush funds.
These agents were often engaged through sham contracts and paid pursuant to false invoices, and the payments to them were improperly
accounted for in Ericssonâs books and records. The resolutions cover the Companyâs criminal conduct in Djibouti, China, Vietnam, Indonesia and
Kuwait.

Between 2010 and 2014, Ericsson, via a subsidiary, made approximately $2.1 million in bribe payments to high-ranking government officials in
Djibouti in order to obtain a contract with the state-owned telecommunications company valued at approximately â¬20.3 million to modernize
the mobile networks system in Djibouti. In order to effectuate the scheme, an Ericsson subsidiary entered into a sham contract with a
consulting company and approved fake invoices to conceal the bribe payments. Ericsson employees also completed a draft due diligence
report that failed to disclose the spousal relationship between the owner of the consulting company and one of the high-ranking government
officials.

In China, between 2000 and 2016, Ericsson subsidiaries caused tens of millions of dollars to be paid to various agents, consultants and service
providers, a portion of which was used to fund a travel expense account in China that covered gifts, travel and entertainment for foreign
officials, including customers from state-owned telecommunications companies. Ericsson used the travel expense account to win business with
Chinese state-owned customers. In addition, between 2013 and 2016, Ericsson subsidiaries made payments of approximately $31.5 million to
third party service providers pursuant to sham contracts for services that were never performed. The purpose of these payments was to allow
Ericsson's subsidiaries in China to continue to use and pay third party agents in China in contravention of Ericssonâs policies and procedures.
Ericsson knowingly mischaracterized these payments and improperly recorded them in its books and records.

In Vietnam, between 2012 and 2015, Ericsson subsidiaries made approximately $4.8 million in payments to a consulting company in order to
create off-the-books slush funds, associated with Ericssonâs customers in Vietnam, that were used to make payments to third parties who would
not be able to pass Ericssonâs due diligence processes. Ericsson knowingly mischaracterized these payments and improperly recorded them in
Ericsson's books and records. Similarly, in Indonesia, between 2012 and 2015, an Ericsson subsidiary made approximately $45 million in
payments to a consulting company in order to create off-the-books slush funds, and concealed the payments on Ericssonâs books and records.

In Kuwait, between 2011 and 2013, an Ericsson subsidiary promised a payment of approximately $450,000 to a consulting company at the
request of a sales agent, and then entered into a sham contract with the consulting company and approved a fake invoice for services that were
never performed in order to conceal the payment. The sales agent provided an Ericsson employee with inside information about a tender for
the modernization of a state-owned telecommunications companyâs radio access network in Kuwait. An Ericsson subsidiary was awarded the
contract valued at approximately $182 million; Ericsson subsequently made the $450,000 payment to the consulting company and improperly
recorded it in its books.

As part of the deferred prosecution agreement, Ericsson has agreed to continue to cooperate with the department in any ongoing investigations
and prosecutions relating to the conduct, including of individuals; to enhance its compliance program; and to retain an independent compliance
monitor for three years.

The department reached this resolution with Ericsson based on a number of factors, including the Companyâs failure to voluntarily disclose the
conduct to the department and the nature and seriousness of the offense, which included FCPA violations in five countries and the involvement
of high-level executives at the Company. Ericsson received partial credit for its cooperation with the departmentâs investigation, which included
conducting a thorough internal investigation, making regular factual presentations to the department, voluntarily making foreign-based
employees available for interviews in the United States, producing extensive documentation and disclosing some conduct of which the
department was previously unaware.

Ericsson did not receive full credit for cooperation and remediation because it did not disclose allegations of corruption with respect to two
relevant matters; it produced certain materials in an untimely manner; and it did not fully remediate, including by failing to take adequate
disciplinary measures with respect to certain employees involved in the misconduct. The Company has been enhancing and committed to
further enhance its compliance program and internal accounting controls. Accordingly, the total criminal penalty reflects a 15 percent reduction
off the bottom of the applicable United States Sentencing Guidelines fine range.

In the related matter, Ericsson agreed to pay to the SEC disgorgement and prejudgment interest totaling approximately $540 million.

The case is being investigated by IRS-Cl. Acting Assistant Chief Andrew Gentin and Trial Attorney Michael Culhane Harper of the Criminal
Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney David Abramowicz of the Southern District of New York are prosecuting the case. The
Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs provided assistance.

The department appreciates the significant cooperation provided by the SEC and law enforcement authorities in Sweden in this case.

The Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice Departmentâs FCPA
enforcement efforts can be found at www.justice.gov/criminal-fraud/foreign-corrupt-practices-act.

Cooperation
5. The parties understand this Agreement carries the potential for a motion for

departure under Section 5K1.1 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines (âSentencing
Guidelinesâ). Defendant understands and agrees that whether such a motion is filed will be
determined solely by the United States through the United States Attorney for the Southern District
of Texas and the Fraud Section. Should Defendantâs cooperation, in the sole judgment and
discretion of the United States, amount to âsubstantial assistance,â the United States reserves the
sole right to file a motion for departure pursuant to Section 5K1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines.
Defendant further agrees to persist in that plea through sentencing, and fully cooperate with the
United States. Defendant understands and agrees that the United States will request that sentencing
be deferred until that cooperation is complete.

6. Defendant understands and agrees that the usage âfully cooperate,â as used herein,
includes providing all information relating to any criminal activity known to Defendant, including,
but not limited to, violations of money launderings and the FCPA. Defendant understands that
such information includes both state and federal offenses arising therefrom. In that regard:

(a) Defendant agrees that this Plea Agreement binds only the United States
Attorney for the Southern District of Texas, and the United States
Department of Justice, Criminal Division, Fraud Section, and Defendant,
and that it does not bind any other United States Attorney or other
component or unit of the Department of Justice;

(b) Defendant agrees to testify truthfully as a witness before a grand jury or in
any other judicial or administrative proceeding when called upon to do so
by the United States. Defendant further agrees to waive his Fifth
Amendment privilege against self-incrimination for the purpose of this

Agreement;

(c) Defendant agrees to voluntarily attend any interviews and conferences as
the United States may request;

(d) Defendant agrees to provide truthful, complete, and accurate information
and testimony and understands any false statements made by Defendant to
the grand jury or at any court proceeding (criminal or civil), or to a
government agent or attorney, can and will be prosecuted under the
appropriate perjury, false statement, or obstruction statutes;

(e) Defendant agrees to provide to the United States all documents in his
possession or under his control relating to all areas of inquiry and
investigation; and

(f) Should the recommended departure, if_any, not meet Defendantâs
expectations, Defendant understands he remains bound by the terms of this
Agreement and that he cannot, for that reason alone, withdraw his plea.

Waiver of Appeal

7. Defendant is aware that Title 28, United States Code, Section 1291, and Title 18,
United States Code, Section 3742, afford a defendant the right to appeal the conviction and
sentence imposed. Defendant knowingly and voluntarily waives the right to appeal the conviction
and the sentence imposed, or the manner in which the sentence was determined, except Defendant
may appeal a sentence above the statutory maximum penalty for the offense charged in Count One
of the Information. Additionally, Defendant is aware that Title 28, United States Code, Section
2255, affords the right to contest or âcollaterally attackâ a conviction or sentence after the
conviction or sentence has become final. Defendant knowingly and voluntarily waives the right
to contest his conviction or sentence by means of any post-conviction proceeding, except that
Defendant does not waive the right to raise a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct
appeal, if otherwise permitted, or on collateral review in a motion under Title 28, United States
Code, Section 2255. In the event the Defendant files a notice of appeal following the imposition
of the sentence, the United States will assert its rights under this agreement and seek specific
performance of this waiver.

8. In agreeing to these waivers, Defendant is aware that a sentence has not yet been

determined by the Court. Defendant is also aware that any estimate of the possible sentencing
range under the Sentencing Guidelines that he may have received from his counsel, the United
States, or the Probation Office, is a prediction, not a promise, and such estimate did not induce
his guilty plea and is binding on neither the United States, the Probation Office, nor the Court.
The United States does not make any promise or representation concerning what sentence
Defendant will receive. Defendant further understands and agrees that the Sentencing Guidelines
are âeffectively advisoryâ to the Court. United States v. Booker, 125 S.Ct. 738 (2005).
Accordingly, Defendant understands that, although the Court must consult the Sentencing
Guidelines and must take them into account when sentencing Defendant, the Court is not bound
to follow the Sentencing Guidelines nor sentence Defendant within the calculated guideline range.
9. Defendant understands and agrees that each and all waivers contained in the
Agreement are made in exchange for the concessions made by the United States in this Plea
Agreement.
The United Statesâ Agreements
10. The United States agrees to each of the following:

(a) At the time of sentencing, the United States agrees not to oppose
Defendantâs anticipated request to the Court and the United States Probation
Office that he receive a two-level downward adjustment under Section
3El1.1(a) of the Sentencing Guidelines should Defendant accept

responsibility as contemplated by the Sentencing Guidelines; and
(b) If Defendant qualifies for an adjustment under U.S.S.G. Section 3E1.1(a)
and Defendantâs offense level is 16 or greater, the United States may move
for an additional one-level downward adjustment based on the timeliness of
the plea or the expeditious manner in which Defendant provided complete

information regarding his role in the offense.

Agreement Binding Only Southern District of Texas and
U.S. Department of Justice, Criminal Division, Fraud Section

11. The United States agrees that it will not further criminally prosecute Defendant in

the Southern District of Texas for offenses arising from conduct charged in the Information. This
Plea Agreement binds only the United States Attorneyâs Office for the Southern District of Texas;
the United States Department of Justice, Criminal Division, Fraud Section; and Defendant. It does
not bind any other United States Attorney or any other component or unit of the Department of
Justice. The United States will bring this Plea Agreement and the full extent of Defendantâs
cooperation to the attention of other prosecuting offices if requested.
United Statesâ Non-Waiver of Appeal
12. The United States reserves the right to carry out its responsibilities under the
Sentencing Guidelines. Specifically, the United States reserves the right to:
(a) Bring its version of the facts of this case, including its evidence file and
any investigative files, to the attention of the Probation Office in
connection with that officeâs preparation of a presentence report;

(b) Set forth or dispute sentencing factors or facts material to sentencing;

(c) Seek resolution of such factors or facts in conference with Defendantâs
counsel and the Probation Office;

(d) File a pleading relating to these issues, in accordance with U.S.S.G.
Section 6A1.2 and Title 18, United States Code, Section 3553(a); and

(e) Appeal the sentence imposed or the manner in which it was determined.
Sentence Determination
13. Defendant is aware that the sentence will be imposed after consideration of the
Sentencing Guidelines, which are only advisory, as well as the provisions of Title 18, United States
Code, Section 3553(a). Defendant nonetheless acknowledges and agrees that the Court has
authority to impose any sentence up to and including the statutory maximum set for the offense(s)
to which Defendant pleads guilty, and that the sentence to be imposed is within the sole discretion
of the sentencing judge after the Court has consulted the applicable Sentencing Guidelines.

Defendant understands and agrees the partiesâ positions regarding the application of the
Sentencing Guidelines do not bind the Court, and that the sentence imposed is within the discretion
of the sentencing judge. If the Court should impose any sentence up to the maximum established
by statute, or should the Court order any or all of the sentences imposed to run consecutively,
Defendant cannot, for that reason alone, withdraw a guilty plea, and will remain bound to fulfill
all of the obligations under this Plea Agreement.
Waiver of Rights

14. Defendant represents to the Court that he is satisfied that his attorney has rendered
effective assistance. Defendant understands that by entering into this Agreement, he surrenders
certain rights as provided in this Plea Agreement. Defendant understands that those rights include

the following:

(a) Defendant understands that he has the right to have the facts of this case
presented to a federal grand jury, consisting of between sixteen and twenty-
three citizens, twelve of whom would have to find probable cause to believe
that he committed the offense set forth in the information before an
indictment could be returned. Defendant acknowledges that he is
knowingly and intelligently waiving his right to be indicted.

(b) If Defendant persisted in a plea of not guilty to the charges, Defendant
would have the right to a speedy jury trial with the assistance of counsel.
The trial may be conducted by a judge sitting without a jury if Defendant,
the United States, and the court all agree.

(c) Ata trial, the United States would be required to present witnesses and other
evidence against Defendant. Defendant would have the opportunity to
confront those witnesses and his attorney would be allowed to cross-
examine them. In turn, Defendant could, but would not be required to,
present witnesses and other evidence on his own behalf. If the witnesses
for Defendant would not appear voluntarily, he could require their
attendance through the subpoena power of the court.

(d) =â At atrial, Defendant could rely on a privilege against self-incrimination and
decline to testify, and no inference of guilt could be drawn from such refusal
to testify. However, if Defendant desired to do so, he could testify on his
own behalf.
Factual Basis for Guilty Plea

15. Defendant is pleading guilty because he is guilty of the charges contained in Count
One of the Information. If this case were to proceed to trial, the United States could prove each
element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. The following facts, among others, would be
offered to establish Defendantâs guilt:

âThe Foreign State Governmentâ was the government of one of the thirty-one states that
comprise Mexico.

From in or around 2005 to in or around December 2010, ERNESTO HERNANDEZ
MONTEMAYOR (âHERNANDEZâ) was an employee of The Foreign State Government with
responsibility for maintaining The Foreign State Governmentâs aircraft.

From in or around 2005 to in or around December 2010, âForeign State Government
Employee 1â was an employee of The Foreign State Government.

âAviation Corporation Aâ was a United States company, headquartered in Brownsville,
Texas, which provided maintenance, repair, overhaul, and related services to customers in the
United States and Mexico, including to The Foreign State Government.

âExecutive 1â was a citizen of the United States and a resident of Texas. Executive 1 was
an employee of Aviation Corporation A from in or around 1975 to at least in or around September
2015. Executive 1 was an owner of Aviation Corporation A from in or around 1993 through in or
around 2010.

âExecutive 2â was a citizen of the United States and a resident of Texas. Executive 2 was
the Director of Maintenance of Aviation Corporation A from in or around 1978 through at least in
or around September 2015. Executive 2 was an owner of Aviation Corporation A from in or

around 1993 through in or around 2010.
âAviation Corporation Bâ was a United States company, headquartered in Houston, Texas,
which provided maintenance, repair, overhaul, and related services to customers in the United
States and Mexico, including to The Foreign State Government.

âExecutive 3â was a citizen of the United States and a resident of Texas. Executive 3 was
an owner of Aviation Corporation B.

From in or around 2006 through at least in or around December 2010, United States
citizens, including Executive 1, Executive 2, Executive 3 and others, knowingly, willfully, and
corruptly agreed to make payments to HERNANDEZ to influence HERNANDEZ in his official
capacity and to secure an improper advantage for companies located in the United States
(collectively, âthe U.S. Companiesâ), including Aviation Corporation A, Aviation Corporation B,
and others, in order to assist the U.S. Companies in obtaining and retaining business with The
Foreign State Government.

From in or around 2006 through at least in or around December 2010, HERNANDEZ
knowingly and willfully conspired with individuals known and unknown, including Foreign State
Government Employee 1, Executive 1, Executive 2, Executive 3, and others, to use the proceeds
of the bribery scheme to engage in monetary transactions from U.S. bank accounts that affected
interstate commerce and were of a value greater than $10,000.

For example, on or about April 19, 2010, HERNANDEZ, Foreign State Government
Employee 1, and others knowingly and willfully used, and caused to be used, the proceeds of the
bribery scheme to issue a $40,000 check from HERNANDEZâs bank account in Texas and to
deposit the $40,000 check into Foreign State Government Employee 1âs bank account.

In furtherance of the conspiracy, HERNANDEZ and his co-conspirators, including

Foreign State Government Employee 1, Executive 1, Executive 2, Executive 3, and others,
co

knowingly and willfully used, and caused to be used, the proceeds of the bribery scheme to engage
in monetary transactions in excess of $10,000 totaling more than $2,000,000.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Tuesday, December 27, 2016

Four Businessmen and Two Foreign Officials Plead Guilty in Connection with Bribes Paid to
Mexican Aviation Officials

Charges were unsealed against six individuals, all of whom have pleaded guilty for their involvement in schemes to bribe Mexican officials in
order to secure aircraft maintenance and repair contracts with government-owned and controlled entities, and two for conspiring to launder the
proceeds of the schemes.

Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Kenneth Magidson of the Southern
District of Texas, Special Agent in Charge Mark Dawson of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcementâs Homeland Security Investigations (ICE-
HSI) in Houston, Special Agent in Charge Shane Folden of ICE-HSI in San Antonio and Special Agent in Charge Rick Goss of Internal Revenue
Service-Criminal Investigationâs (IRS-Cl) Houston Field Office made the announcement.

âThe six convictions announced today demonstrate the departmentâs commitment to holding accountable those who further official corruption
through bribery,â said Assistant Attorney General Caldwell. âThese convictions are the result of a coordinated effort by prosecutors and agents
who built the cases brick by brick using traditional law enforcement techniques.â

âHSI special agents and our law enforcement partners will continue to aggressively investigate financial crimes committed by corrupt foreign
officials,â said Special Agent in Charge Folden. âThis case serves as a reminder that HSI will use all its resources to identify, investigate and
dismantle these criminal networks wherever they operate.â

âThe individuals involved in this scheme paid millions of dollars in bribes to foreign officials in exchange for aviation contracts that placed
legitimate businesses at a significant competitive disadvantage,â said Special Agent in Charge Goss. âIRS-Clâs role in unraveling this scheme
assisted in facilitating the guilty pleas that were announced today.â

Douglas Ray, 55, of Magnolia, Texas, and Victor Hugo Valdez Pinon, 54, a citizen of Mexico, pleaded guilty on Oct. 28 and Oct. 26, 2016,
respectively, before U.S. District Judge Alfred H. Bennett of the Southern District of Texas to conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act (FCPA) and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Kamta Ramnarine, 69, and Daniel Perez, 69, both of Brownsville, Texas, both pleaded guilty on
Nov. 2, 2016, before U.S. District Judge Ricardo H. Hinojosa of the Southern District of Texas to one count of conspiring to violate the FCPA.
Ramnarine and Perez are scheduled to be sentenced on Jan. 30, 2017. Ray and Valdez Pinon are scheduled to be sentenced Feb. 23, 2016.

Ernesto Hernandez Montemayor, 55, and Ramiro Ascencio Nevarez, 58, both of whom are citizens of Mexico and were previous officials of
Mexican state government entities, each pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. Hernandez Montemayor
pleaded guilty before Judge Bennett on Dec. 9, 2015, and is scheduled to be sentenced on Jan. 12, 2017. Nevarez pleaded guilty before Judge
Hinojosa on March 4, 2016, and was sentenced to 15 months in prison on May 27, 2016.

According to the defendantsâ plea agreements, between 2006 and 2016, Ray conspired with Valdez and others to bribe Mexican officials. The
defendants and their co-conspirators, who owned or were associated with companies in the United States that provided aircraft maintenance,
repair, overhaul and related services to customers from the United States and Mexico, paid the bribes in order to secure parts and servicing
contracts with Mexican government-owned customers. Ray agreed to pay bribes to at least seven different foreign officials, including
Hernandez Montemayor, sometimes paying the bribes via wire transfer and checks to accounts in the United States controlled by the officials.
As part of his guilty plea, Hernandez Montemayor admitted that while employed by a Mexican state government, he accepted bribes from Ray,
Ramnarine, Perez and others in exchange for taking certain actions to assist companies they owned in winning business with Hernandez
Montemayorâs state government employer. Hernandez Montemayor also admitted that he conspired with Ray, Ramnarine, Perez and others to
launder the proceeds of the bribery scheme.

Ramnarine and Perez admitted that, in addition to bribing Hernandez Montemayor, they also conspired to pay bribes to several other foreign
officials between 2007 and 2015 to ensure that their Brownsville-based company won aircraft parts and services contracts with Mexican
government-owned customers. As part of his guilty plea, Nevarez admitted that while employed by a Mexican public university, he accepted
bribes from Ramnarine and Perez in exchange for taking certain actions to assist their company in winning business with the university.
Nevarez also admitted that he conspired with Ramnarine, Perez and others to launder the proceeds of the bribery scheme.

In total, Ray, Valdez Pinon, Ramnarine, Perez and their co-conspirators paid more than $2 million in bribes to Mexican officials, including
Hernandez Montemayor and Nevarez, in order to secure aviation maintenance, repair and overhaul contracts.

ICE-HSI and IRS-CI are investigating the case. Trial Attorneys Christopher Cestaro and Kevin R. Gingras of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section
and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jesse Salazar and Arthur Jones of the Southern District of Texas are prosecuting the case. The Criminal Division's
Office of International Affairs also provided significant assistance.

The Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the

departmentâs FCPA enforcement efforts can be found at www. justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.

Case 1:19-cr-20388-JEM Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 06/28/2019 Page 6 of 16

DOMINGUEZ and LUGO GOMEZ awarding contracts on behalf of Corpoelec to the Florida-
registered companies owned and controlled by the bribe-paying co-conspirators.
MANNER AND MEANS OF THE CONSPIRACY

The manner and means by which LUIS ALFREDO MOTTA DOMINGUEZ,
EUSTIQUIO JOSE LUGO GOMEZ, and their co-conspirators sought to accomplish the
purpose of the conspiracy included, among other things, the following conduct in the Southern
District of Florida and elsewhere:

4, In or around the second half of 2015, Luis Alberto Chacin Haddad, Co-Conspirator
1, and Co-Conspirator 2 submitted bids to Corpoelec in hopes of obtaining contracts to provide
equipment. Despite submitting low and competitive bids, they were not successful in securing
contracts with Corpoelec.

5. In or around the first half of 2016, Luis Alberto Chacin Haddad, Co-Conspirator 1,
and Co-Conspirator 2 joined together with Jesus Ramon Veroes, a close acquaintance of LUIS
ALFREDO MOTTA DOMINGUEZ, to pursue contracts with Corpoelec. Thereafter, Veroes
met with MOTTA DOMINGUEZ to discuss what would be required to obtain the contracts.
MOTTA DOMINGUEZ told Veroes that he would award the Corpoelec contracts to Veroes and
his business partners (Luis Alberto Chacin Haddad, Co-Conspirator 1, Co-Conspirator 2), and that
Veroes should discuss and negotiate the terms with EUSTIQUIO JOSE LUGO GOMEZ.

6. As directed, Jesus Ramon Veroes met with EUSTIQUIO JOSE LUGO GOMEZ
to discuss and negotiate the awarding of the contracts. LUGO GOMEZ explained that for every
contract awarded by Corpoelec, Veroes, Luis Alberto Chacin Haddad, and their associates would
be required to pay LUGO GOMEZ and LUIS ALFREDO MOTTA DOMINGUEZ kickbacks

from the profits.

 
 

Case 1:19-cr-20388-JEM Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 06/28/2019 Page 7 of 16

7. After finalizing the negotiations, LUIS ALFREDO MOTTA DOMINGUEZ and
EUSTIQUIO JOSE LUGO GOMEZ directed or caused Corpoelec to award Company A,
Company B, and Company C multiple contracts for the supply of equipment.

8. Luis Alberto Chacin Haddad, Jesus Ramon Veroes, and their co-conspirators
inflated the price of the contracts to increase their own profits and the corrupt payments going to
LUIS ALFREDO MOTTA DOMINGUEZ and EUSTIQUIO JOSE LUGO GOMEZ.

9. LUIS ALFREDO MOTTA DOMINGUEZ and EUSTIQUIO JOSE LUGO
GOMEZ caused Corpoelec to direct payments on the corrupt and inflated contracts to bank
accounts located in the Southern District of Florida and elsewhere.

10. Co-conspirators would and did discuss the corrupt scheme and the amount of bribes
that would be paid to LUIS ALFREDO MOTTA DOMINGUEZ and EUSTIQUIO JOSE
LUGO GOMEZ on the contracts awarded to Company A, Company B, and Company C, and how
the profits otherwise should be divided among the co-conspirators.

11. In discussions with his co-conspirators, Luis Alberto Chacin Haddad anticipated
that the initial bribe payment to LUIS ALFREDO MOTTA DOMINGUEZ and EUSTIQUIO
JOSE LUGO GOMEZ would be approximately $2 million.

12. LUIS ALFREDO MOTTA DOMINGUEZ and EUSTIQUIO JOSE LUGO
GOMEZ approved the following Corpoelec contracts on behalf of Corpoelec: (a) contract dated
on or about July 11, 2016, for Company A to provide forklifts to Corpoelec for $6,429,000;

INFORMATION
THE UNITED STATES CHARGES:

COUNT ONE
(Conspiracy â 18 U.S.C. Â§ 371)

Introduction

At all times material to this Information:

1. Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (âPDVSAâ) was the Venezuelan state-
owned and state-controlled oil company. PDVSA and its subsidiaries were
responsible for the exploration, production, refining, transportation, and trade in
energy resources in Venezuela and provided funding for other operations of the
Venezuelan government. Bariven S.A. (âBarivenââ) was the PDVSA procurement
subsidiary responsible for equipment purchases. PDVSA and its wholly owned
subsidiaries, including Bariven, were âinstrumentalitiesâ of the Venezuelan
government as that term is used in the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (âFCPAâ),

Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2(h)(2)(A). PDVSA officers and
employees were âforeign officialsâ as that term is used in the FCPA, Title 15,
United States Code, Section 78dd-2(h)(2)(A).

2. At all relevant times, Abraham Jose SHIERA BASTIDAS
(âSHIERAâ), who has been charged separately, was the owner of a number of
other U.S.-based energy companies that supplied equipment and services to
PDVSA, and a resident of the United States, and thus a ââdomestic concernâ and an
officer, director, employee, agent, and shareholder of a âdomestic concernâ as
those terms are used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-
2(h)(1).

3. At all relevant times, Roberto Enrique RINCON FERNANDEZ
(âRINCONâ), who has been charged separately, was the owner of a number of
U.S.-based energy companies, including several companies based in the Southern
District of Texas, that supplied equipment and services to PDVSA, and a resident
of Texas, and thus a âdomestic concernâ and an officer, director, employee, agent,
and shareholder of a âdomestic concernâ as those terms are used in the FCPA, Title
15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2(h)(1). RINCON and SHIERA worked
together on a number of PDVSA contracts and contract bids.

4. Defendant FERNANDO ARDILA RUEDA (âDefendant
ARDILAâ), a resident of Miami-Dade County, Florida, worked as a business

partner of SHIERA and a minority owner of SHIERAâs companies, including a
company headquartered in the Southern District of Texas. Among other things,
Defendant ARDILAâs responsibilities included serving as sales director or
manager for certain of the companies, including generating business for these
companies with PDVSA by approaching and developing relationships with
PDVSA officials. Defendant ARDILA was thus a âdomestic concernâ and an
officer, director, employee, agent, and shareholder of a âdomestic concernâ as
those terms are used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-
2(h)(1).

5. âOfficial H,â an individual whose identity is known to the United
States, was at all relevant times employed by PDVSA or a wholly owned
subsidiary thereof, including as a planning and engineering supervisor. Official
Hâs job responsibilities included helping to select or recommend vendors for
specific PDVSA projects. Official H was a âforeign officialâ as that term is used
in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2(h)(2)(A).

6. âAccountant 1,â an individual whose identity is known to the United
States, worked as an accountant for SHIERAâs companies.

7. âAccountant 2,â an individual whose identity is known to the United

States, worked as an accountant for SHIERAâs companies.
The Conspiracy

8. Beginning in at least 2008 and continuing through at least 2014, in the

Southern District of Texas, and elsewhere, the defendant,
FERNANDO ARDILA RUEDA,

did willfully, that is, with the intent to further the objects of the conspiracy, and
knowingly conspire, confederate, and agree with SHIERA, RINCON, and others
known and unknown, to commit offenses against the United States, that is: being a
domestic concern and an officer, director, employee, agent, and shareholder of a
domestic concern, and together with a domestic concern, to willfully make use of
the mails and means and instrumentalities of interstate commerce corruptly in
furtherance of an offer, payment, promise to pay, and authorization of the payment
of any money, offer, gift, promise to give, and authorization of the giving of
anything of value to a foreign official and to a person, while knowing that all or a
portion of such money and thing of value would be and had been offered, given,
and promised to a foreign official, for purposes of: (i) influencing acts and
decisions of such foreign official in his official capacity; (ii) inducing such foreign
official to do and omit to do acts in violation of the lawful duty of such official;
(iii) securing any improper advantage; and (iv) inducing such foreign official to
use his influence with a foreign government and agencies and instrumentalities
thereof to affect and influence acts and decisions of such government and agencies

4
and instrumentalities, in order to assist Defendant ARDILA, SHIERA, RINCON,
their companies, and others in obtaining and retaining business for and with, and
directing business to, SHIERAâs and RINCONâs companies, in violation of the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2(a).
Purpose of the Conspiracy

9. The purpose of the conspiracy was for Defendant ARDILA,
SHEIRA, RINCON, and their co-conspirators, to enrich themselves by obtaining
and retaining lucrative energy contracts with PDVSA through corrupt and
fraudulent means, including by paying bribes to PDVSA officials, including, but
not limited to, Official H.

Manner and Means of the Conspiracy

10. The manner and means by which Defendant ARDILA and his co-
conspirators sought to accomplish the purpose of the conspiracy included, among
other things, the following, while in the Southern District of Texas and elsewhere:

11. In order to obtain and retain business for and on behalf of SHIERAâs
and RINCONâs companies, Defendant ARDILA, together with others, including
SHIERA and RINCON, would and did discuss:

a. the need to provide things of value to PDVSA officials;

b. the identity of the PDVSA officials whom they would target;

c. the particular things of value to provide to those officials; and

d. the manner and means by which things of value would be provided.

12. Defendant ARDILA, together with others, including SHIERA and
RINCON, would and did solicit and agree with PDVSA officials, on behalf of
SHIERAâs and RINCONâs companies, that those companies would pay bribes
based on a percentage of any contracts the PDVSA officials helped to award to
SHIERAâs and RINCONâs companies.

13. Defendant ARDILA, together with others, including SHIERA and
RINCON, caused bribe payments to be wired from the bank accounts of
SHIERAâs companies to the bank accounts of PDVSA officials, their relatives, or
other individuals or entities designated by the PDVSA officials who received the
bribes, including to bank accounts in the Southern District of Texas.

14. Defendant ARDILA, together with others, including SHIERA, would
and did provide to PDVSA officials things of value, including meals and
entertainment, in order to obtain and retain business on behalf of SHIERAâs and
RINCONâs companies.

15. Defendant ARDILA, together with others, including SHIERA, would
and did attempt to conceal the bribery scheme by creating and using private e-mail

accounts to communicate about the scheme.

Overt Acts

16. In furtherance of the conspiracy and to achieve the objects thereof, at
least one of the co-conspirators committed or caused to be committed, in the
Southern District of Texas and elsewhere, at least one of the following overt acts,
among others:

17. Onor about November 10, 2008, Defendant ARDILA sent an e-mail
to Accountant 1 stating, as translated into English, âWe need to make a payment of
US$74,753.00 to this ally.ââ The co-conspirators frequently referred to the PDVSA
officials to whom they were paying bribes as âaliados,â or, as translated into
English, âalliesâ or âallieds.â For the purpose of concealing the identities of the
PDVSA officials when discussing bribe payments related to the scheme, Defendant
ARDILA and his co-conspirators assigned each official an âaliado number.â

18. Onor about July 13, 2010, Defendant ARDILA sent an e-mail to
Accountant | and SHIERA stating, as translated into English, âAttached, please
find what we have to pay urgently out of the pending amount to the allies.â

19. Onor about September 29, 2011, Defendant ARDILA sent an e-mail
to Accountant 2 stating, as translated into English, âWe need to make a transfer of
US$ 100K to AL_100[the âaliado numberâ for Official H]. Please confirm. Note
that I am going to going to give you 2 accounts for you to divide the transfer

amount into 60 and 40%.â Defendant ARDILA then set forth the account

information for an account in the United States in the name of a relative of Official
H.

20. Onor about October 19, 2011, one of SHIERAâs companies
transferred $40,000 from its account in Panama to the account in the name of
Official Hâs relative described in Paragraph 19 above.

21. Onor about June 4, 2012, Defendant ARDILA wrote to Accountant 1
and SHIERA, stating, as translated into English, âIâm attaching the coordinates for
the first 5|OK$ to be wired to [Official H]...you can make several transfers with
amounts lower than 50K$.â

22. Defendant ARDILA frequently circulated among his co-conspirators
a series of spreadsheets that tracked the bribe payments that were owed to various
PDVSA officials, who were identified on the spreadsheets by nicknames and
âaliado numbers.â Defendant ARDILA generally referred to this spreadsheet as
âSchindlerâs List.â On or about September 9, 2013, Defendant ARDILA sent an
e-mail to Accountant 2 attaching such a spreadsheet and stating, as translated into
English, âPlease find the requested indicators and the updated Schindler list. Be
very careful with this information and do not make any transfer to anyone who

does not have an identifier.â

All in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 371.

Florida Businessman Pleads Guilty to Foreign Bribery Charges in Connection With Venezuela
Bribery Scheme

A partial owner of several Florida-based energy companies pleaded guilty today to foreign bribery charges for his role in a scheme to corruptly
secure contracts from Venezuela's state-owned and state-controlled energy company, Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA).

Acting Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Blanco of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, Acting U.S. Attorney Abe Martinez of the
Southern District of Texas and Special Agent in Charge Mark Dawson of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcementâs Homeland Security
Investigationsâ (ICE-HSI) Houston office made the announcement.

Fernando Ardila Rueda (Ardila), 49, of Miami, pleaded guilty in federal court in Houston, to one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and one count of violating the FCPA. U.S. District Judge Gray H. Miller of the Southern District of Texas accepted
the guilty plea. Sentencing is scheduled for Feb. 8, 2018.

According to admissions made in connection with his plea, Ardila conspired with U.S.-based businessmen Abraham Jose Shiera Bastidas (Shiera)
and Roberto Enrique Rincon Fernandez (Rincon) to pay bribes and other things of value to PDVSA purchasing analysts. The bribes were paid to
ensure that Shieraâs and Rinconâs companies were placed on PDVSA bidding panels and in order to obtain or retain business with PDVSA. From
2008 through 2014, while he was sales director, manager and partial owner of several of Shieraâs companies, Ardila provided entertainment and
offered bribes to PDVSA officials based on a percentage of the value of contracts the officials helped to award to Shieraâs companies.

Rincon, Shiera and two other former employees of Shieraâs companies have also pleaded guilty in the case. Including Ardila, the Justice
Department has announced a total of 10 individuals have pleaded guilty and are pending sentencing as part of a larger, ongoing investigation
by the U.S. government into bribery at PDVSA.

ICE-HSI is conducting the ongoing investigation with assistance from IRS-Criminal Investigation. Trial Attorneys Aisling O'Shea and Jeremy R.
Sanders of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section, and Assistant U.S. Attorneys (AUSA) John Pearson and Robert S. Johnson of the Southern
District of Texas are prosecuting the case. AUSA Kristine Rollinson of the Southern District of Texas is handling the forfeiture aspects of the
case,

The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs and the Swiss Federal Office of Justice also provided assistance.

The Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice Departmentâs FCPA

enforcement efforts can be found at www. justice. gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.

PROBABLECAUSE Â© |

16. In 2016, a Confidential Source (CS) approached the HSI Miami Office (HSI-
Miami) regarding 78 million in Euros the CS received, which originated from a loan contract with
PDVSA. The CS was involved in a money laundeting conspiracy and wanted to surrender the
money and cooperate. HSI-Miami thereafter began an undercover investigation: Organized Crime
and Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF) Operation Money Flight.

17. TheCs agreed to, wear a recording device and Operation Money Flight proceeded
proactively with an initial focus on the defendantsâ efforts to launder a portion of the 78 million in
Euros (the âPDVSA firhdsâ) in and through South Florida.

18. âTwo years and over one hundred recordings later, Operation Money Flight revealed
an international conspiracy to launder the PDVSA funds through Miami and several large-scale,
international third-party money-laundering organizations. More specifically, the investigation

revealed the use of Miami real estate and sophisticated false-investment schemes to: launder

hundreds of millions of U.S. Dollars.

Venezuelan Corruption & Miami Laundering
19. Venezuela has a foreign-currency exchange system under which the government
âwill exchange local currency (Bolivars) at a fixed rate for U.S. Dollars. The fixed exchange rate
has been well below the true economic rate by a substantial factor for several years. For example,
in 2014, the Venezuelan government fixed exchange rate was approximately six Bolivars to one
U.S. Dollar. By contrast, the true economic exchange rate was approximately sixty Bolivars to one
U.S. Dollar. Y

20. The difference betweenâ the fixed rate and the true economic rate creates
opportunity for fraud and abuse. c

21. For example, in 2014, an individual could exchange 10 million U.S. Dollars
for 600 million Bolivars at the true economic rate. Then, if that individual had access to the
government fixed rate, he could convert that sameâ600 million Bolivars into 100 million U.S.
Dollars. Essentially, in two transactions, thatâperson could buy 100 million U.S. Dollars for 10
million U.S. Dollars. â

22. Massive fraud and corruption is rampant throughout Venezuelaâs government-run
foreign-exchange system. Estimates of the fraud range as high as $20 billion a year, and reports
indicate that corrupt government officials take kickbacks to authorize exchanges at the fixed
rate. Z

23. Embezzlement of Venezuelaâs dwindling foreign currency reserves is the fuel for

these corrupt exchange schemes. PDVSA is Venezuelaâs primary source of income and foreign

currency (namely, U.S. Dollars and Euros), and serves as the source of foreign currency used to

fund corrupt foreign exchange embezzlement schemes. As with Venezuela in general, fraud and
corruption is reportedly common at PDVSA.

24. Venezuelaâs state of social, political, and economic crisis in which multi-billion-
Dollar corrupt and criminal ecosystems thrive drives rivers of criminal proceeds through South
Florida, which has become an international money-laundering hub and a desirable destination for
well-to-do foreign criminals and kleptocrats.

False-Investment Money Laundering van

25. Most of the defendants are sophisticated operators with respect to the international
banking system and are aware of banksâ general due diligence and anti-money laundering
practices, including know-your-customer (K YC) requirements: .

26. Importantly, for one party to wire funds to a third party, there must be some
legitimate business justification provided to the bank: for instance, a payment for the purchase of
real estate or equipment. Moreover, a bank will ask for documents supporting the justification,
whichâdepending on the transactionâCan be difficult to manufacture; for instance, a bank may
be able to verify whether a supposed real estate transaction took place. This verification poses a
problem for money laundering transactions in which large sums of criminal proceeds must be
moved around the finaficial system from one person to another as bribes, kickbacks, transfers, or
exorbitant expenditures, for instance.

27. Accordingly, false investments in fake securities are convenient justifications in
that they are more difficult for a bank to investigate and verify. By way of example, one party
might wire 30 million U.S. Dollars to a third party with the justification that the amount is a loan

to the third party, supported by a 30 million U.S. Dollar promissory note due at some point in the

future, which neither party actually intends to honor. For the bank, ascertaining the true intent of
the parties and the fraudulent nature of the investment is difficult.

28. Sophisticated false-investment money laundering schemes are used throughout this
conspiracy, ranging from individual false securities (promissory notes and bonds) to entire false-
investment funds, which can be subscribed to as needed to justify transactions.

29. Surrounding and supporting these false-investment laundering schemes are
complicit money managers, brokerage firms, banks, and real estate investment firms in the United
States and elsewhere, operating as a network of professional money launderers.

Money Laundering Conspiracy .

30. The conspiracy in this case began in December 2014 with a currency exchange
scheme to embezzle approximately 600 million US. Dollars from PDVSA, obtained through
bribery and fraud, and the defendantsâ efforts to use the CS to launder a portion of the proceeds of
that scheme (the PDVSA funds). By May of*2015, the conspiracy had doubled in amount to 1.2
billion U.S. Dollars embezzled from PDVSA.

31. The facts of the âconspiracy set forth below are evidenced by electronic
communications and docunients, government records, financial records, recordings of phone
conversations and in-pÃ©rson meetings, and CS statements.

4 CONVIT & URDANETA Approach the CS

32. In 2014, URDANETA and CONVIT approached the CS with an offer to sell 100

million U.S. Dollars at a favorable Bolivar exchange rate and without the CS having to front the

Bolivars.
Case iTe-cr20085-KMW DBooumentS Entered on FLSD Docket 07/24/2018 Page 9 af 3s

33. | The CS agreed because the CS had clients in Venezuela to whom the CS could sell
the U.S. Dollars. From previous business dealings, the CS knew CONVIT obtained U.S. Dollars
from exchange contracts with PDVSA. |

34. |The CS expected to receive a simple buyer-seller foreign exchange (âforexâ)
contract to memorialize the agreement with CONVIT and URDANETA.

35. Over the course of the next month, January 2015, CONVIT, URDANETA, and the
CS continued to discuss and facilitate the supposed forex transaction, often via BlackBerry
Messenger (BBM) chats and while CONVIT was present in the Southern District of Florida,
according to U.S. travel and other records.â <

36. During this time, CONVIT delayed providing the forex contract to the CS, but this' ~
did not overly concern the CS because the funds were coming from a regulated asset management
firm, âEuropean Financial Institution 1,â which the Ã©s could explain to the receiving bank.

37. | The CS instructed CONVIT toâwire the funds from European Financial Institution
1 to an account belonging to a trust, of which the CS was the ultimate beneficiary. CONVIT agreed
and informed the CS that the funds âwould arrive in Euros and not U.S. Dollars.

38. By February, 12, 2015, the CS had received approximately 78.8 million Euros into
the trust from Europeari Financial Institution 1 in four separate wire transfers beginning on January
14, 2015. 4

39. After receiving the initial 36 million Euros in mid-January, the CS asked CONVIT

via BBM chat on January 13, 2015 if the CS could sell about 20 million Euros to a client, but

CONVIT replied âno.â CONVIT explained that he had already paid for the Bolivars on his end

 

* According to these records, CONVIT arrived in the Southern âDistrict of Florida on December
20, 2014 and departed on January 18, 2015.
Case [:bS-cr-20685-KMW Document friterecd on FLSD Docket 7/24/2018 Page LO of 33

(meaning he had no immediate need for Bolivars), and that the CS would have to wait about a
month to sell the Euros further.

40. On February 6, 2015, the CS informed CONVIT that the CS urgently needed the
forex contract between the CS and European Financial Institution 1 for the CSâs bankâs compliance
department. The CS asked CONVIT for a form draft so that the CS could prepare it.

41. That same day, CONVIT finally sent the CS a (PDF) document to justify the
transfer between European Financial Institution 1 and the CSâs trust. What CONVIT sent,
however, was a false joint venture contract between a Hong Kong shell company, Eaton Global
Services Limited, and the CSâs trust, with a forged signature on behalf of the CSâs trustee. The CS
had never seen this contract before.

42. The fake joint venture contract, dated December 17, 2014, contemplated a fictitious ;
600 million U.S. Dollar joint venture between Eaton Global and the CSâs trust; the supposed
business of the joint venture was the making of loans to PDVSA:

43, On February 9, 2015, the CS told CONVIT that the fake joint venture contract could
not be used. CONVIT and URDANETA assured the CS that the fake contract had not been used

)
or provided to any bank.

y

44. The CSâalso requested the original underlying exchange contracts and CONVIT
responded that URDANETA had physical copies and would deliver them. Days later in Venezuela,
the CS received the documents in-person from URDANETA, who explained that he obtained the
documents from âCONSPIRATOR 1,â a former PDVSA official.

45. These documents, which the CS provided to HSI-Miami, reveal the source of the

PDVSA funds and the nature of the scheme.
Case [:ES-cr-20685-KMW Document friterecd on FLSD Docket O7/24/2018 Page Li of 33

PDVSA Bribery & Embezzlement Scheme Revealed
46. Thesource of the PDVSA funds was a PDVSA foreign-currency exchange scheme
benefitting Eaton Global. The exchange scheme was disguised as a âfinancingâ arrangement using
the following three documents (provided by URDANETA) in an artless attempt to hide what was
ultimately revealed as an embezzlement:
a. First, a loan contract, dated December 17, 2014, between PDVSA
. and Rantor Capital C.A., a Venezuelan shell company, in which Rantorâagreed to
loan 7.2 billion Bolivars to PDVSA. The loan contract was executed by
âVENEZUELAN OFFICIAL 1â as Vice President of PDVSA;
b. Second, an assignment contract, dated December 23, 2014, between
Rantor and Eaton Global, in which Rantor assigns its rights as PDVSAâs creditor
under the loan contract to Eaton Global and in which it is contemplated that PDVSA
is given the right to cancel the debt within 180 days by paying 600 million U.S.
Dollars; and <
C. Third, a notice of assignment letter, dated December 23, 2014, in
which Eaton Global informs PDVSA (VENEZUELAN OFFICIAL 1) of the
assignment andâ suggests that PDVSA repay the 7.2 billion Bolivar loan in the Euro
equivalent of 600 million U.S. Dollars. The letter included instructions for PDVSA
to wire the funds to European Financial Institution 1 accounts for the benefit of
Eaton Global. |
47. In short, Eaton Global ended up with the right to pay PDVSA about 7.2 billion
Bolivars (worth around 35 million Euros) and receive about 510 million Euros, of which about

78.8 million Euros was sent to the CS.
Case iis-cr-20685-KMW Document Entered on FLSO Docket 07/24/2018 Page 12 of 33

48. While the CS continued to wait for a forex contract from CONVIT and
URDANETA, the CS began to conduct third-party transactions on their and CONSPIRATOR 1âs
behalf. Ultimately, the CS learned that the CS was not involved in a forex transaction, but rather a
money laundering operation in which the CS was expected to launder the proceeds of the
embezzlement and make cash kickback payments to VENEZUELAN OFFICIAL 1.

49. In April 2015, the CS began making cash payments in Venezuela at URDANETA
and CONSPIRATOR 1âs direction, including to URDANETA, CONSPIRATOR 1, and
VENEZUELAN OFFICIAL 1, which would ultimately total over 1 million U.S. Dollars.

50. In all, the CS conducted approximately 15 million Euros-worth of transactions
through the summer of 2015, including several U.S.-Dollar wire transactions at the defendantsâ
direction,â until the CS began to resist making further payments. Around that time, the CS used
the liquidation of the CSâs trustee as an excuse to halt payments: the CS claimed that the CS could
not continue without the forex contract. CONVIT and URDANETA continued to pressure the CS.
The ensuing impasse led to a meeting around November 2015 at CONVITâs office in Venezuela,

51. Around November 5015 , CONVIT summoned the CS to a meeting at CONVITâs
office in Caracas, Venezuela. Prior to the meeting, CONVIT explained to the CS that the CS would
meet AMPARAN, who was in charge of the financial documents.

52. At the meeting, CONVIT, URDANETA, AMPARAN, and the CS sat around a
table. CONVIT had a handgun on the table. Next to CONVIT was a German Shepard with a shock

collar. CONVIT held the remote for the collar, and commented that he could not always control

the dog. The meeting took place at CONVITâs office with numerous security guards; according to
the CS, the mood was one of intimidation by CONVIT.

53. | AMPARAN told the CS that the fake joint venture contract -had in fact been
provided to European Financial Institution 1âs banks in Canada and Malta. Accordingly,
AMPARAN explained that it would be impossible to replace the contract with a simple forex
contract and additional fake contracts were needed. The CS asked to return the PDVSA funds and
reverse the transactions, but was told a reversal was impossible. L

The CS Records the Defendants

54. Beginning in February 2016, the CS recorded conveisations with the defendants
and other conspirators in which they explicitly acknowledgedâ the money laundering conspiracy
and underlying embezzlement. As evidence by the following recordings, during this time, the cs
worked with URDANETA, ORTEGA, and CONSPIRATOR 1 to account for and distribute the
PDVSA funds to themselves and others andâto ensure that AMPARAN supplied the additional
fake contracts necessary to do so. |
55. In a-February 19, 2016 recorded meet with URDANETA, the CS complained that
the CS needed additional documents from AMPARAN. URDANETA agreed and said that he
would write to AMPARAN, CONVIT and âCONSPIRATOR 2â to âbug themâ about the
contracts. URDANETA also stated that they (CONVIT, et al.) are being âhit right nowâ by people
in the âassemblyâ and joked that it is not a âpifiata,â in an apparent reference to corrupt Venezuelan
officials hitting the defendants up for bribes. URDANETA also stated that he would not go to the

United States because the last time he was searched at the border and âthey took away [his] phone.

[And t]hank God [he] didnât have [his] phone, but a new phone.â

11
Case iiS-cr-20685-KMW Document 3S Entereci on FLSO Docket O7/24/2018 Page 14 of 83

56. In a February 22, 2016 recorded meet with ORTEGA, ORTEGA and the CS
discussed how to move ORTEGAâs money from the CS to ORTEGA. The CS explained that it is
not simple, and ORTEGA, regarding the source of his portion of the PDVSA funds, stated:

So we can be frank and open with each other. Now. You know the origin of that.

And that comes from... from something that is still making noise and itâs still

making noise and itâs still making noise. Itâs going to explode one day. [ mean,

maybe not tomorrow, and also, itâs not the... our friend, the leader in all this, he is
everywhere every day

ORTEGA also acknowledged CONSPIRATOR 1âs"" role in assigning him a portion of the PDVSA
funds and fretted aloud:

Itâs all that shit theyâve been talking about, investigatioris and shit. Or the
Americans going into all this, is that tue? How far does that reach?

But, how far could they get, in your opinion? If they get to the Swiss and they tell
them, âI want, I want this information.â Do they have to give it to them?

Finally, the CS and ORTEGA walked through somÃ© account opening forms and discussed how
ORTEGA could avoid declaring himself as a politically exposed person (also known as a PEP) on
bank KYC documents. a

57. In a February 23; 2016 recorded conversation with âCONSPIRATOR 3â
(CONSPIRATOR 1âs brother the CS explained that the CSâs trustee is liquidating and
âeventually thereâs a risk of the trustee checking the operationâ and finding that the âthe guys did
a fake deal, falsifying the signatures of these guys who are there.â The CS explained that the CS â
called URDANETA and CONSPIRATOR | and told them that they have to set the documentation
straight. The CS and CONSPIRATOR 3 also discussed a meeting in Caracas between the CS,
URDANETA, and AMPARAN about fixing the document, and CONSPIRATOR 3 noted that he

has a âpayment for [VENEZUELAN OFFICIAL 1].â

 

4 CONSPIRATOR 1 is a former PDVSA official.

12
Case BAB Cr 20685-R VW . Document S Entered on FLOD Docket O7/24/2018 Page 15 of 33

58. In a March 7, 2016 recorded meet with URDANETA, the CS and URDANETA
recounted the receipt and expenditure of the PDVSA funds to date (âseventy eight million eight
hundred and somethingâ). They recounted how much belonged to CONSPIRATOR 1 (âfourteen
million five hundred forty thousand six hundred twenty-fiveâ) and other expenditures, including a
list of cash payments to include payments to VENEZUELAN OFFICIAL 1 who authorized the
underlying PDVSA loan agreement. The CS recounted the cash kickbacks to VENEZUELAN
OFFICIAL 1 as follows: | 7 |

[VENEZUELAN OFFICIAL 1], I gave him... to the boy he sent-in one occasion

two hundred thousand [200,000], June fourth [4'*] and in another occasion one
hundred thousand [100,000], on June twenty sixth [26""). .

URDANETA agreed. URDANETA and the CS then discussed AMPARANâs plan to make new

| fake contracts justifying the transaction (the CS noted to URDANETA that AMPARAN is flying
to Miami in several days). URDANETA was conÃ©Ã©med that he didnât want to leave a trail of
âbreadcrumbsâ with respect to the accounts. URDANETA again acknowledged CONVITâs
involvement and CONSPIRATOR 1âs arrangement with ORTEGA. CONSPIRATOR 1 joined the
meeting and discussed with URDANETA and the CS the fake joint venture contract, who was
responsible for it, and how âto divide up the PDVSA funds.

59. Importantly, at this meeting, URDANETA and CONSPIRATOR 1 reviewed a
spreadsheet of all the cash payments and expenditures created by the CS; each acknowledged the
contents of the document, wrote notes on it, checked off transactions, and, ultimately, dated it. The
CS provided a copy of this document to HSI-Miami with both URDANETA and CONSPIRATOR
1âs handwritten notes ; included on the spreadsheet are the kickback payments to VENEZUELAN
OFFICIAL 1. |

60. In a March 9, 20 16 recorded meet with AMPARAN and URDANETA,

AMPARAN ran through the plan to replace the fake joint venture agreement with new documents.

s

13
Case U18-cr-20685-KMW BocumentS Erierecd on FLSO Docket O7/24/2018 Page 16 of 33

AMPARAN explained that the fake agreement could be replaced with the new (better) fake ones
in the compliance file at the Canadian bank and added to the file at European Financial Institution
1, and further that the âAccounting Firm 1â auditors are on board. AMPARAN explained that he
is flying to Miami the next day and from there he will print out and provide the CS with the new
fake contracts.

61. In a March 15, 2016 recorded meet with ORTEGA, ORTEGA explained to the CS
that he has found a âpersonâ (GUSTAVO) with a âstructureâ to transfer his PDVSA funds to
ORTEGA, and asks the CS to meet with the person in New York, Miami; or Panama. ORTEGA
asked the CS what the CSâs story is and why the CS is acting differently âovernightâ and whether
it is âan investigationâ; the CS explained that everyone is âmaking messes,â that the CS has
âstart[ed] to find out about stuff... the [CS] didnâ t know,â and that the CSi 1S stopping because the
CS doesnât want to get into trouble. ORTEGA explaiced that the rumor is that the âAmericans are
investigating you, that you are in big troubleâ and asked the CS whether the CS is under
investigation and what the banks have asked the CS.

62. In an April 2, 2016 recorded meet with ORTEGA and GUSTAVO in Panama,
ORTEGA introduced the CS to GUSTAVO, who explained how he can launder money using his
brokerage firm and private mutual fund. Specifically, GUSTAVO explained that his brokerage
firm, GSA, operates from the United States, but primarily does business in Latin America and
manages $2 billion.* Regarding GSAâs reputation, GUSTAVO explained:

I would say that our profile, would be by-by nature a business that we prioritized

the type of client with which we deal, uh...letâs say if it is a low profile, we go even
, D

 

> I am further aware, that GSA is affiliated with Global Strategic Investments, LLC (GSI), which
is a broker/dealer headquartered in Miami, Florida. GUSTAVO and the CS would later conduct
numerous meetings at GSIâs office in Miami.

14
 

lower, that way they will never talk about us, or any advertising, or any cocktail
parties.

GUSTAVO explained that they operate a fake mutual fund which receives money from a payment
made to look like an investment into the fund, but is actually laundered out of the fund. GUSTAVO
explained that âweâll make the transactions in such a way that the purchase will look legitimateâ
and that the money can be directed anywhere on the back-end using âcardsâ or âchecksâ or even
âwire transfers,â but as to the latter he (GUSTAVO) will âalways be on the lookout to see the
transfer and whoâs receiving it, because...[l]ike the saying goes, the fish dies by its mouth. ...they
have their eyes on everyone.â GUSTAVO went on to explain how he ean avoid being tracked by
the authorities such as Interpol and acknowledged that ORTEGA and the CSâs situation is a âtime
bomb.â Finally, GUSTAVO insisted that they use WhatsApp to communicate and avoid emails.Â®
Cooperation Begins & Conspiracy Continues in Miami

63. In April 2016, the CS began cooperating with HSI-Miami and continued making
consensual recordings with the defendants and other conspirators.

64. The conspiracy continued in four primary aspects. First, AMPARAN worked to
replace the fake joint venture contact with better fake contracts to justify the initial transfers to the
CS. Second, AMPARAN worked to launder URDANETAâs portion of the PDVSA funds. from
the CS using false investments. Third, GUSTAVO worked to launder ORTEGAâs portion of the
PDVSA funds fom the CS, also using false investments. And fourth, KRULL and GUSTAVO

worked to launder additional PDVSA funds that did not originally flow through the CS.

 

6 Based on my training and experience, encrypted peer-to-peer chat services, such as WhatsApp,
are preferred by individuals engaged in criminal activity because law enforcement is generally
unable to obtain the content of the communications from the service provider.

15
Case 1: bS-cr-20685-K MW Document 3S friterecd on FLSD Docket O7/24/2018 Page 18 of 33

65. During the course of this conspiracy, GUSTAVO also laundered funds as part of a
scheme to promote international narcotics trafficking. KRULL also contacted the CS with several
separate plans to launder money from at least one foreign bribery scheme, all as set forth below.

AMPARANâs Replacement of the Fake Joint Venture Contract

66. Ina recorded April 27, 2016 meet with AMPARAN at the Miami, Florida office of
Solar Cargo, Inc.,7 AMPARAN and the CS discussed the fake joint venture contract and
AMPARAN acknowledged that it was meant to justify the movement of the PDVSA funds to the
cs and that CONVIT was involved. AMPARAN assured the CS not toâworry about European
Financial Institution 1 and the fake contract because European FinanÃ©ial Institution 1 will let him
know if there is an investigation and AMPARAN âcan manipulate that.â AMPARAN and the CS
discussed supplemental fake contracts AMPARAN had previously prepared and provided.
AMPARAN also began to explain how he will lander URDANETAâs portion of the PDVSA
funds using fake bonds. â

67. On or around May 26,: 5016, the CS received a BBM chat from AMPARAN
instructing him where in Venezuela to pick up the proposed fake contracts. The CS had an assistant
pick up the replacement fake contracts from AMPARAN and provided them to HSI-Miami.

68. On May 25, 2016, URDANETA sent a BBM chat to the CS stating that
âT*âCONSPIRATOR 4%] ... has an offer and I prefer you to speak directly with him.â On May 27,

2016, the CS had a recorded call with CONSPIRATOR 4, and explained to CONSPIRATOR 4

that the CS was working with AMPARAN to fix things and that the CS had explained to the bank '

 

7 AMPARAN explained in the recorded meet that he works for Solar Cargo, that it has six planes
operating, and that he had recently been hired by PDVSA to move medicine from Iran to
Venezuela.

8 CONSPIRATOR 4 is associated with CONVIT and formerly with PDVSA .

16
Case [:bS-cr-20685-K MW Document frierecd on FLSD Docket 7/24/2018 Page 19 of 33

that the PDVSA funds were from an exchange transaction. CONSPIRATOR 4 responded âOh they
made it upâ and the following conversation ensued: |

CONSPIRATOR 4: This is bad. This is bad when not-not-not... The truth is not
L spoken and canât-canât-canât even do [unintelligible]
regarding it since it never happened.

CS: Uh-huh. But...the truth was a foreign exchange transaction,
correct?

CONSPIRATOR 4: The truth it was, was, was not a foreign exchange.
transaction. It does not exist in Bolivars. Not atall, it was
a payment [unintelligible]

CONSPIRATOR 4 suggested a meeting in Venezuela with everyone who has âan interestâ to sort
things out and fix âthe papersâ before things get bad when it is too-late.

69. On June 13, 2016, the CS met with AMPARAN in Venezuela and they executed
replacement fake contracts. The replacement fake contracts (later provided to HSI-Miami by the
CS) included a complex array of bogus financing and trust documents involving Rantor, the CSâs""
trust, and other entities.

70. On June 22, 2016, AMPARAN sent the CS an email with a fake loan agreement
between Solar Cargo and Rantot meant to supplement the replacement fake contracts. In BBM
chats between AMPARAN and the CS in August 2016, AMPARAN asked if the CS received the
latest contract, and the CS responded yes. On September 5, 2016, AMPARAN sent the final fake
contract between Solar Cargo and a company belonging to the CS. All of these replacement fake
contracts were backdated to early 2014.

AMPARAN and URDANETAâs Efforts to Continue Laundering PDVSA Funds

71. As mentioned above, in an April 27, 2016 recorded meet with AMPARAN in

Miami, the efforts to launder URDANETAâs portion of the PDVSA funds from the CS occurred

_ simultaneously to AMPARANâs efforts to replace or supplement the fake joint venture contract.

17
Case [:bS-cr-20685-KMW Document frierecd on FLSD Docket 7/24/2018 Page 20 of 33

During that meet, AMPARAN explained how he would launder URDANETAâs portion of the
PDVSA funds using the purchase of a fraudulent bond designed to default to conceal the transfer:

we are now working through a mechanism, through which, we issue a bond through
a bank, from which we have, eh, on which we have a lot of influence, or several
banks, but one in particular that is the one, we are working with right now, we issue
a bond. ... That you on that side would buy, you would make an investment in that
bond, we receive, um, that, eh, receive that money for the purchase of that bond
and you keep the bond on that side. In the term of, a number of months, that bond
starts going down in price, ... until there comes a moment when it flips, ... but the
account is never closed, nor, nor are funds transferred, the funds never leave, and
an investment is made. â4

72. In a May 12, 2016 recorded call with URDANETA, URDANETA and the CS
recounted the CSâs meeting with AMPARAN and the- defaulting-bond laundering plan.
URDANETA brought up an apartment âover thereâ in Miami for which he paid a significant

deposit that he is being pressured to close on in 60 days by the developer and agreed to send the

a
Lf

CS the notice from the developer.

2, URDANETA later sent the @S an image of a May 10, 2016 email from the
developer of the Porsche Design Tower in Miami, informing him of the upcoming closing on the
unit. The email included âPre Closing Questionnaireâ provided by the developer contains the
following warning: âNote: taking title under a company or trust may trigger FinCEN reporting
requirements.â In a follow up chat with the CS, URDANETA explained that he was worried about
the FinCEN reporting requirement and discussed ways to minimize the risk; URDANETA
suggested forming a new company with his wife as the beneficial owner.

74. In a May 17, 2016 recorded call with URDANETA, URDANETA discussed the

transfer of the Miami condominium with the equity of URDANETAâs down payment to

AMPARAN as a fee for AMPARANâs laundering services. And, ina May 18, 2016 recorded meet

18
Case [:ES-cr-20685-KMW Document friterecd on FLSD Docket O7/24/2018 Page 21 of 33

with AMPARAN at Solar Cargo in Miami, AMPARAN and the CS discussed using the Miami
condominium as a feeâ and moving forward with the defaulting-bond laundering plan. :

75. In a November 21, 2016 BBM chat, AMPARAN provided the details of an
additional fraudulent bond purchase to launder URDANETAâs PDVSA funds and explained that
the bond purchase will be facilitated through a U.K. broker dealer, âEuropean Financial Institution
2.â

76. In a March 1, 2017 recorded meet, the CS met with URDANETA, AMPARAN,
âCONSPIRATOR 5,â!â and GOIS, at the offices of European Company 1-in Madrid, Spain. Prior
to the meeting, URDANETA was captured on the recording explaining âto the CS that the CS:
should not be concerned about the fake joint venture contract-or being caught because they only
had to worry about the United States and the âAmericans ... have no jurisdictionâ; URDANETA
uses the word âlaunderâ to describe their activities. â

77. The purpose of the meeting was for the CS to gain comfort with the âoperationâ
proposed by AMPARAN. CONSPIRATOR 5 and GOIS were introduced as the managers of the
operation and meant to comfort the CS, who had relayed misgivings to URDANETA about
working with AMPARAN,, .

78. During'the meeting, GOIS asked if there is anything he can tell the CS to make him

more comfortable and the CS noted that he was concerned about European Financial Institution 2

â

 

Â°AMPARAN and URDANETA would later report that they worked out a solution to achieve the
transfer. Miami-Dade Property records show that the property was transferred from the developer
to Paladium Real Estate Group LLC on January 12, 2017. According to the Florida Department of
State, Paladium was formed on May 26, 2016 with URDANETAâs wife as an owner. On
September 23, 2016, AMPARANâs wife was added as a manager of Paladium, and on September
15, 2017, after the closing, URDANETAâs wife was removed, leaving AMPARAN in control of Â©
Paladium and the condominium.

Case (:ES-cr-20685-KMW Document frierec on FLSD Docket O7/24/2018 Page 22 of 33

because they asked âno questionâ and had âno objectionâ when an account was opened in the CSâs
name to purchase the fake bond. GOIS explained that there is no issue with European Financial
Institution 2, AMPARAN, GOIS, and CONSPIRATOR 5 went on to explain that they manage a
fund which allows them'foâ* generate payment structures, and third party payments institution, with
a very light KYC.ââ AMPARAN emphasized that they can make payments to âMiami, Panama,
Europeâ: the CS clarified, âAnd you have no issues paying in the United States?â, to which
AMPARAN replied, âNo.â GOIS explained that the CS should first buy a U.K. GILT, then
transfer it to an account in the CSâs name at European Financial Institution 2, after which it will
be swapped with the fake bond to begin the transfer to URDANETA.â |
~79. On April 26, 2017, the CS, at the request of GOIS and URDANETA, purchased a
5-million-pound U.K. GILT. On June 20, 2017, the CS, at the request of GOIS, ordered his bank,
to âfree deliverâ the GILT to an account opened for fhe CS at European Financial Institution 2. At
European Financial Institution 2, GOIS would oversee an operation to have the GILT exchanged
for a separate worthless bond, so the funds could ultimately be transferred to and concealed for
URDANETA. Thereafter, the patties continued to discuss the movement of the balance of
~ URDANETAâs portion of the PDVSA funds through 2018, though-no additional funds have been
moved to date. ra
80. Inâ a recorded December 11, 2017 meet with GOIS in the U.K., GOIS explained
how European Company 1 is the front supporting the laundering operation with the fake bond, and
that AMPARAN, CONSPIRATOR 5, and âCONSPIRATOR 6â!! are the directors. GOIS alsoâ ~

lamented their criminal exposure, and advised the CS as follows:

...the faster you get out, the better for you. Because if you... theyâre going to lock
us all up. That... Iâm telling you, [CS], what do you want me to tell you? That itâs

 

'l CONSPIRATOR 6 is a third-party money launderer.

not like that? Itâs the truth, thereâs going to be a day that they are going to lock all
of us up; they are going to lock us up. This will be known. [CS], I have no doubt.
I already saw where the shit comes from. I saw where it comes from, how theyâre
doing things, then in the end, whoever has the money is the one who is going to
have problems. The rest, well, he will have to defend himself, saying âLook, I got
paid here.â Youâll defend yourself in your own way, Iâll defend myself in the same
way. But that will happen

ORTEGA and GUSTAVOâs Efforts to Continue Laundering PDVSA Funds

81. Also beginning in April 2016, ORTEGA and GUSTAVO continued their efforts to
launder ORTEGAâs portion of the PDVSA funds through GUSTAVOâs fake mutual fund, which
culminated in the actual movement of funds about a year later. e |

82. In February 2017, the CS laundered some of ORTEGAâs portion of the PDVSA

âfunds with GUSTAVOâs fake mutual fund structure at ORTEGAâs direction. On February, 21,

2017, GUSTAVO emailed the CS subscription instructions and a subscription agreement for the
fake fund. Per these documents, the name of the find was Global Securities Trade Finance, aw
Cayman Islands entity, and the custodian bank was âUS Financial Institution 1â in New Jersey.
On February 24, 2017, the CS instructed 4 bank in the Bahamas (where a portion the PDVSA funds
were then held) to subscribe to the fund per the instructions in the amount of 5,000,0000 US.
Dollars. Thereafter, on or around February 28, 2017, that amount was wired to U.S. Financial
Institution 1; the fake subscription was obtained by the CS, and the 5,000,000 U.S. Dollars was
available for further use by ORTEGA.

83, In a March 29, 2017 recorded meet in Miami, Florida, the CS asked GUSTAVO
about U.S. Financial Institution 1 and GUSTAVO explained that the bank is controlled by his
partners in Uruguay, who also control another bank in Puerto Rico (âU.S. Financial Institution 2â)

and that they âhave our people in the backâ of the bank.

21
Case :bS-cr-20685-KMW Document friterecd on FLSD Docket O7/24/2018 Page 24 of 33

84. Innumerous BBM chats between the CS and ORTEGA, ORTEGA asks how things
are going with âGâ (GUSTAVO) and acknowledges the ongoing laundering of his (ORTEGAâs)
funds.

85. Later in April 2017, GUSTAVO, with ORTEGAâs agreement, laundered $400,000

. of the $5,000,000 back to the CS as the CSâs âfeeâ for the CSâs role in facilitating the laundering
of ORTEGAâs$5,000,000 to GUSTAVO. The CS provided GUSTAVO with an undercover (UC)
bank account in the name of a shell company in the Southern District of Floridato receive the fee.
On April 24, 2017, GUSTAVO wired $396,000 from U.S. Financial Institution 1 to the UC .
account. To âjustify,â i.e., conceal, the transaction, GUSTAVO created a fake loan contract
between the UC shell company and Global Securities Trade Finance.

86.  Thenext stage of this scheme was the laundering of the fake subscription out of the |
CSâs account and into an account ultimately benefiting ORTEGA in order to eliminate any final
trace of the movement. GUSTAVO and ORTEGA proposed several methods for this, which the
CS rejected. These efforts continue to this day. Over the course of the summer of 2017, however, .
GUSTAVO revealed his connections to yet another complicit US. financial institution, U.S.
Financial Institution 2, in an effort to launder the subscription.

87. In a rec6rded June 7, 2017 meet with GUSTAVO, GUSTAVO told the CS that he
works with U.S.Financial Institution 2, that he knows the owner, and that he can facilitate things:
âSure, and discreet. And the good thing about [U.S. Financial Institution 2] is that without being,
without being in U.S., it is in U.S....in Puerto Rico.â GUSTAVO later introduced the CS to
GUTIERREZ, the majority shareholder of U.S. Financial Institution 2, and the CS and

GUTIERREZ agreed to meet in the future.

22
 

88. On July 31, 2017, GUTIERREZ flew to Miami from Uruguay to meet with the CS. }
During a rÃ©corded meet on July 31, 2017 with GUTIERREZ in Miami, the CS explained td
GUTIERREZ that the CS needed to transfer GUSTAVOâs fund subscription to GUSTAVOâs
âclientâ (ORTEGA) with no trail. The CS and GUTIERREZ discussed options including internal
account-to-account transfers at U.S. Financial Institution 2.

89. In a recorded August 14, 2017 call with GUTIERREZ, GUTIERREZ and the CS
further discussed the subscription to GUSTAVOâs fund. GUTIERREZ offered possible schemes
to justify the transaction using U.S. Financial Institution 2 and agreÃ©d that U.S. Financial
Institution 2 will charge a two-and-a-half percent (2.5%) fee. c

90. During a recorded August 15, 2017 meet with GUSTAVO in Miami, Florida, the
CS complained to GUSTAVO about how explicit GUTIERREZ was regarding their criminal

| | c
activities because he seemed reckless, and the following conversation ensued as GUSTAVO
attempted to reassure the CS that GUTIERREZ did not know about the ORTEGA âkick-backsâ:
cs I mÃ©an, I didnât tell him, âLook, this Ortega
thing is a kick-back,â but I imagine that he
a ~ knows what it is, mean...
GUSTAVO No, no, I havenât told him anything at all, I
: mean, zero [0], zero [0], zero [0]. And I
a will never tell him anything because itâs not
necessary. I never say anything to these
4 people because you donât need to. There
_isnât, I mean... everything is done well.

91. ORTEGA ultimately rejected the U.S. Financial Institution 2 option because he

wanted to avoid the United States. The transfer of the subscription remains unresolved.
GUSTAVOâs Other Laundering Schemes
92. During the course of multiple meetings in Miami with the CS, GUSTAVO

attempted to develop a relationship with the CS as a potential feeder of additional criminal clients

23
Case DLd-cr-20685-KMW Document Erterec on FLSD Docket O7/24/2018 Page 26 of 33

in need of money laundering. Indeed, GUSTAVO would go on to encourage and develop
additional money laundering schemes with the CS, touting his connections at multiple U.S.
financial institutions along the way, including other broker/dealers, in addition to U.S. Financial
Institutions 1 & 2.

93. In a November 8, 2016 recorded meet in Miami, the CS conducted a sting against
GUSTAVO, informing GUSTAVO about a âclientâ who had to buy a plane in Brazil that is âdoing
a delicate jobâ and is âgoing to move ... sensitive merchandise.â Prior to the cs proposing this
transaction, GUSTAVO assured the CS that the CS could speak franklyâas they were âbeyond
good and evil.â The CS explained that the client needed to pay someone in Spain for the plane,
but that the payment could not be traced back to the plane because âthere could be a risk ... the
authorities eventually investigate the plane.â GUSTAVO responded âokâ and âuh huhâ without
hesitation. The CS further explained that source money is in the United States and is completely
clean. GUSTAVO suggested some options and quickly agreed: âWeâll open an account right away
... and weâll make the paymentâ and tat they will justify receiving the payment by selling the
âclientâ a âproduct,â ie., a false investment. The CS and GUSTAVO agree to only charge the
âclientâ ten percent (30,000 U.S. Dollars) in the hopes that he will do more business with them.

94. Thereafter, GUSTAVO and the CS discussed the logistics of the transfer on several

â occasions. In Jariuary 9, 2017 recorded meet, the CS explained to GUSTAVO that the CS was
worried about ORTEGA and the money they (Venezuelan kleptocrats) are moving more than the
CS was âwortied about the plane, the DEA.â GUSTAVO responded, âYes, yes.â

95. On January 10, 2017, the CS and GUSTAVO commenced the transaction. Upon

the CS receiving instructions from GUSTAVO, HSI-Miami wired 300,000 U.S. Dollars from a

UC account in the Southern District of Florida to a U.S. Wells Fargo account held by Global

24
Case 1: bS-cr-20685-KMW Document friterecd on FLSD Docket O7/24/2018 Page 2? of 33

Securities Management LLC, and, on or around January 13, 2017, the funds were received in a
UC account in Spain as instructed. As previously agreed, GUSTAVO emailed the CS a fake
300,000 U.S. Dollar loan contract to support the initial transaction as well as an invoice from
Global Securities Management in the amount of 30,000 U.S. Dollars for âLoan Structuring.â
KRULLâs Conspires to Launder Additional PDVSA Funds with GUSTAVO

96. In October 2016, the CS met with KRULL in Panama. KRULL explained that he
was looking for a bank to deposit approximately 600,000,000 U.S. Dollars: from a currency
exchange with PDVSA on behalf of a client, âCONSPIRATOR 7,â!? and which the CS learned
were located in Gazprombank. The CS stated the CS could exploreâsome options but needed a
contract proving the source of funds. On November 8, 2016, KRULL explained that he had the
contract. In a November 17, 2016 WhatsApp chat, KRULL asked if the CS had âthe hushâ
(meaning hushmail, an encrypted email provider), and the CS provided a hushmail address. That
same day a PDVSA loan contract arrived at tle CSâs hushmail account.

97. | The PDVSA contract that the CS received from KRULL was an amendment to the
original contract between PDYSA âand Rantor, and doubled the credit line from 7.2 to 14 billion
Bolivars. The amendment ,was dated May 25, 2015, and specifically incorporated the initial
PDVSA loan contract.â

98. Over the course of the next few weeks, KRULL continued to press the issue over
WhatsApp chats, explaining his client was in a âhurry.â On November 30, 2016, the CS and
KRULL met again in Panama. Per the CS, KRULL explained that the funds came from exchange

contracts which generated around 1.2 billion U.S. Dollars. KRULL explained that, in addition to

 

2 CONSPIRATOR 7 is another reported billionaire member of the âboliburguÃ©sâ and owner of a
television network in Venezuela.

25
 

the 600-million-Dollar solution for CONSPIRATOR 7, KRULL needed an additional solution for
200 million U.S. Dollars held in European Financial Institution 1 in the name of a straw owner,
âCONSPIRATOR 8.â (The CS recognized CONSPIRATOR 8 as a straw owner previously
proposed to be used to conceal money for the stepsons of VENEZUELAN OFFICIAL 2, a.k.a,
âlos chamos,â during a prior meeting with the CONSPIRATOR 8, CONVIT, and âlos chamos.âââ)

99. On November 30, 2016, KRULL sent the CS a WhatsApp message with photos of
CONSPIRATORS 7 and 8âs Venezuelan passports. KRULL also forwarded an email to the CS
explaining the European Financial Institution 1 structure; the email was in fact a string of
previously forwarded emails attaching documents from Buropean Financial Institution 1, which
had been sent from AMPARAN to âCONSPIRATOR 9,â to CONSPIRATOR 7, to KRULL, and
to the CS. . |

100. In early December 2016, the CS infotmed KRULL of a solution for laundering the
additional PDVSA funds. The CS ultimately pfoposed GUSTAVO and his mutual-fund laundering
solution. On December 21, 2016, KRULL sent the CS a resume for CONSPIRATOR 8, whom
KRULL referred to as his âbuddy.* In a later recorded January 7, 2017 phone call with KRULL,
the CS explained that he could not use the CONSPIRATOR 8 resume, noting ââthis shit is a joke.â
KRULL agreed, âYesyitâs a joke.... I agree, I agree.â |

101. In a recorded January 9, 2017 meet with GUSTAVO in Miami, the cs asked
GUSTAVO for a solution similar to ORTEGAâs for CONSPIRATORS 7 & 8, and GUSTAVO -
immediately agreed. GUSTAVO noted that CONSPIRATOR 7 has one of the wealthiest fortunes
from the ââchavismo.ââ GUSTAVO walked through all the different laundering options for both and
how to handle any âK YCâ issues. KRULL later agreed to the solution presented by GUSTAVO,

and in BBM chats would acknowledge âGustavoâ when inquiring of the status. The CS and

26
 

KRULL and the CS and GUSTAVO had numerous recorded conversations and message chats
about the scheme over the course of months.

102. In a January 10, 2017 recorded. conversation, KRULL noted that
âTCONSPIRATOR 7]â is asking if the money can be sent. In another, on January 23, 2017,
KRULL said the money at European Financial Institution 1 is ready to be moved to
CONSPIRATOR 8 and thatââI met the dude, and also met the guy that represents him.â The CS
asked, âAre these the guyâs sons?â (meaning the stepsons of VENEZUELAN OFFICIAL 2), and
KRULL responded, âNah. Donât, donât, donât ask.â

103. Ina January 31, 2017 recorded call, the CS informed KRULL that he is in Miami
and both discuss the laundering further. KRULL acknowledged receiving money from the.
European Financial Institution 1 accounts before (i.e., other laundering activity) when he described
how the wires work. <

104. On March 7, 2017, KRULL sÃ©nt the CS a WhatsApp chat and explained that the
clients are asking about GUSTAVOâs fuitd being in the United States. In a March 7, 2017 recorded
call, KRULL advised that â[CONSPIRATOR 7|â is worried, and the CS explained that the fund
is not in the United States, but that GUSTAVO has offices in the United States (Miami and New
York). The CS explainÃ©d that GUSTAVO lives in Miami. KRULL asked if GUSTAVO can fly to
Panama, and the-CS assured KRULL he could.

105. âOn March 16, 2017, the CS met with KRULL and CONSPIRATOR 8 in Panama,
and at one point called GUSTAVO (who was not in Panama) to discuss the laundering operation.
During the meeting, CONSPIRATOR 8 stated that he ârepresented three persons.â After the
meeting, KRULL confided to the CS that he had once seen CONSPIRATOR 8 at CONSPIRATOR

7âs office having lunch with âlos chamos,â i.e., the stepsons of VENEZUELAN OFFICIAL 2.

27

-

106. Inarecorded April 5, 2017 call with KRULL, KRULL stated that CONSPIRATOR
8 was worried about wiring funds to purchase GUSTAVOâs fraudulent fund to U.S. Financial
Institution 1 in New Jersey because he was worried about using U.S. banks. KRULL explained
that he told CONSPIRATOR 8 it was irrelevant because all U.S. Dollar wire transactions travel
through correspondent banks in the United States regardless.

107. Ina recorded April 14, 2017 meet in Miami with KRULL, KRULL and the CS
discussed GUSTAVO and CONSPIRATOR 7 and the plan to launder the other PDVSA funds.

108. GUSTAVO and KRULL would continue to discuss this scheme with the CS for
months thereafter. For instance, in a recorded call with KRULL on August 2, 2017, the CS told
KRULL, âI am going to be with GUSTAVO tomorrow ... and heâs going to ask me about the fund
with the children.â KRULL explained that he is not sure, but that âCONSPIRATOR 7â may be
doing something on it with âChenteâ (AMPARAN) had explained that he (KRULL) speaks mostly
to â[CONSPIRATOR 8]â about it because heâis âthe client.â

109. Records obtained from erfail search warrants confirm the flow of the PDVSA funds
from PDVSA to the defendants and other conspirators through European Financial Institution 1.
For instance, a September 201 5 email circulated among AMPARAN and CONSPIRATORS 5 and:
6 with the subject lineââNumeros [CONSPIRATOR 7] includes an attachment titled âOperation
600k,â which contains the following work sheets:

a. A work sheet titled âDetailed Income from PDVSAâ shows ten
transfers from PDVSA from December 29, 2014 through February 3, 2015 totaling
511,913,270.74 Euros. .

b. A work sheet titled âSummary of the 600 Operationâ shows that, of

the 511 million Euros: 20,476,530.83 was assigned to European Financial

Institution 1 as a 4% fee; 227,265,537.52 Euros went to the âBOLIâ (CONVIT andâ
CONSPIRATOR 2); 159,085,876.26 Euros went to âCHAMOSâ (the stepsons of
VENEZUELAN OFFICIAL 2); and 68,179,661.26 Euros went to CONSPIRATOR
7. The remaining 36,905 ,664.87 Euros was accounted for as the âCostâ of the initial
7.2 billion Bolivars used to obtain the 511 million Euros.
c. Further worksheets account for how each recipient moved the
money. The âBOLIâ for instance moved 78.8 million Euros to the CS and the
majority of the rest through apparent shell companies, Volbor Vontobel and
Vencon Holding. CONSPIRATOR 7 sent dozens of US, Dollar wires through
banks in Malta and Austria, including to aviation and yacht services as well as
brokerage companies in Miami, Florida.
These records not only exhibit the conspiracy in blint detail, but confirm the connection among
KRULL and the additional conspirators and the initial 78.8 million Euros in PDVSA funds
received by the CS. <
KRULLâs Additional V Venezuelan Laundering Schemes

110. Throughout,the course of KRULLâs scheme to launder the additional PDVSA
funds with the CS, KRULL presented other laundering schemes to the CS: One of the schemes
involved a relative of VENEZUELAN OFFICIAL 3 who needed a way to receive kickbacks from
foreign law firms who had been hired by the Government of Venezuela.

111. KRULL first approached the CS with this scheme in the summer of 2017 because

KRULL needed a laundering structure for receiving the kickbacks. Both KRULL and the CS

agreed that GUSTAVO was again a good laundering option.

29
Case :1S-cr-20685-KMW Document frierecd on FLSD Docket 7/24/2018 Pade 32 of 33

112. On June 29, 2017, KRULL called the CS and, in a recorded conversation, the CS
told KRULL that he is in Los Angeles, California. KRULL said he has to be âcandid and directâ
and stated:

Uh, Iâm sitting here with, with, with, with the [title of VENEZUELAN OFFICIAL

3]âs brother.... And, and, and well, they, they, they have earned in the last years a

payment theyâre going to receive that is for five [5]....Okay? And, and, and we

have been talking about the, the, the options they, they might have. Right? And,

and, and I donât know if, if, if you have something that you, that you might think
of, as to how it can be, uh, things can be structured. Right?

113. The CS noted that it may be difficult based on the recipient's piofile, but said they
can talk more tomorrow and explained he will be flying to Miami then. Ina later recorded call on
June 29, 2017, KRULL further specified that these were payments from law firms that had handled
international arbitrations on the Venezuelan governmentâs behalf with international companies and
had charged the government a lot of money (5,000,000 U.S. Dollars). In a recorded call the next
day, June 30, 2018, the CS, KRULL, and VENEZUELAN OFFICIAL 3âs brother discussed ways
to launder the payment which was again explicitly described as payments deriving from law firms
who represented Venezuelan government in arbitrations. Different options for laundering the
payments and âKYCâ requiremÃ©nts were discussed.

114. Ina recordÃ©d August 25, 2017 meet with GUSTAVO in Miami, the CS explained
that KRULL had two sjients related to VENEZUELAN OFFICIAL 3 who needed a way to launder
the payments they are going to receive from attorneys who were hired by the Venezuelan
government. The CS specifically stated âthe lawyers are giving them their. kick backsâ and
GUSTAVO responded, âMm-hmmm.â The CS then suggested that the lawyers themselves would
pay the kickback, and GUSTAVO immediately corrected him:

No, they canât pay these two [2] guys. No, thatâs impossible.... Just imagine.

Specially nowadays with OFAC, and with all of these people reviewing every
money transfer every day. .... Brother, thatâs kindergarten Algebra. Right? Well,

30
 

we will have to give a vehicle to each one of these guys...A private fund...The
same thing we did for [ORTEGA].

115. Inrecorded meetings on August 29, 2017 and November 14, 2017 with KRULL in
Miami, the CS and KRULL further discussed the kick-back laundering scheme.
CONCLUSION
116. Based on the foregoing, probable cause exists that the defendants conspired to
launder monetary instruments, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1956(h), and
did travel in and use facilities of interstate and foreign commerce to further the laundering

activities, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1952. y -

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Wednesday, July 25, 2018

Two Members of Billion-Dollar Venezuelan Money Laundering Scheme Arrested

Two alleged participants in a billion-dollar international scheme to launder funds embezzled from Venezuelan state-owned oil company PDVSA
using Miami, Florida real estate and sophisticated false-investment schemes were arrested yesterday and today.

Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Benjamin Greenberg of the
Southern District of Florida and Special Agent in Charge Mark Selby of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcementâs Homeland Security
Investigationsâ (HSI) Miami Field Office made the announcement.

Matthias Krull, 44, a German national and Panamanian resident, and Gustavo Adolfo Hernandez Frieri, 45, a Colombian national and naturalized
U.S. citizen, were charged in a criminal complaint with conspiracy to commit money laundering. The complaint also charged Francisco Convit
Guruceaga, 40; Jose Vincente Amparan Croquer, aka, âChente,â 44; Carmelo Urdaneta Aqui, 44; and Abraham Eduardo Ortega, 51, all
Venezuelan nationals; and Hugo Andre Ramalho Gois, 39, a Portuguese national, and Marcelo Federico Gutierrez Acosta y Lara, 40, a Uruguayan
national, for their alleged participation in the scheme. These defendants remain at large. Krull was arrested last night in Miami and had his
initial court appearance earlier today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Alicia M. Otazo-Reyes in Miami. Krull is scheduled to have a pre-trial
detention hearing on July 30, and a preliminary hearing on Aug. 8. Frieri was arrested today in Sicily, Italy and faces extradition proceedings.

According to the criminal complaint, the conspiracy in this case allegedly began in December 2014 with a currency exchange scheme that was
designed to embezzle around $600 million from PDVSA, obtained through bribery and fraud, and the defendantsâ efforts to launder a portion of
the proceeds of that scheme. By May 2015, the conspiracy had allegedly doubled in amount to $1.2 billion embezzled from PDVSA. PDVSA is
Venezuelaâs primary source of income and foreign currency (namely, U.S. Dollars and Euros).

The complaint alleges that surrounding and supporting these false-investment laundering schemes are complicit money managers, brokerage
firms, banks and real estate investment firms in the United States and elsewhere, operating as a network of professional money launderers.

The alleged conspirators include former PDVSA officials, professional third-party money launderers, and members of the Venezuelan elite,
sometimes known as âboliburguÃ©s.â

The charges contained in the complaint are merely allegations and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a
reasonable doubt in a court of law.

This case is the result of the ongoing efforts by the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF) âOperation Money Flight,â a
partnership between and among federal, state and local law enforcement agencies. The OCDETF mission is to identify, investigate and
prosecute high-level members of drug trafficking enterprises, bringing together the combined expertise and unique abilities of federal, state
and local law enforcement.

HSI Miami, HS! London, HSI Rome and HSI Madrid investigated this case. The case is being prosecuted by Assistant Chief David Johnson of the
Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Francisco R. Maderal of the Southern District of Floridaâs International Narcotics
and Money Laundering Section.

The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs provided substantial assistance in this matter and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the
National Crime Agency of the United Kingdom and Italian, Spanish and Maltese law enforcement authorities provided assistance. The Fraud
Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice Departmentâs FCPA

enforcement efforts can be found at www. justice. gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.

offense level for purposes of sentencing guideline calculations for the charged offense is 12;

b. That a 14-level enhancement of the guideline offense level applies under
U.S.S.G. Â§ 2B1.1 since the offense involved a benefit received of more than $550,000.

c. That a two-level increase to the offense level applies since the offense
involved more than one bribe pursuant to U.S.S.G. Â§ 2C1.1(b)(1);

d. As of the date of this agreement, it is expected that Defendant will enter a

plea of guilty prior to the commencement of trial, will truthfully admit his involvement in the

11
Case 1:19-cr-00008-SOM Document10 Filed 01/22/19 Page12of20 PagelD #: 42

offense and related conduct, and will not engage in conduct that is inconsistent with such
acceptance of responsibility. If all of these events occur, and Defendantâs acceptance of
responsibility continues through the date of sentencing, a downward adjustment of 2 levels for
acceptance of responsibility will be appropriate. See U.S.S.G. Â§ 3E1.1(a) and Application Note
3.

e The Government agrees that the Defendantâs agreement herein to enter
into a guilty plea constitutes notice of intent to plead guilty in a timely manner, so as to permit
the government to avoid preparing for trial as to the Defendant. Accordingly, the Government
anticipates moving in the Governmentâs Sentencing Statement for a one-level reduction in
sentencing offense level pursuant to Guideline Â§ 3E1.1(b)(2), if the Defendant is otherwise
eligible. The Defendant understands that notwithstanding its present intentions, and still within
the Agreement, the prosecution reserves the rights (1) to argue to the contrary in the event of
receipt of new information relating to those issues, and (2) to call and examine witnesses on
those issues in the event that either the United States Probation Office finds to the contrary of the
prosecutionâs intentions or the Court requests that evidence be presented on those issues.

f. The Defendant has a Criminal History Category of I.

g. Although not binding on the probation office or the Court, the parties
agree that the Defendantâs total offense level is likely to be 25, which corresponds to a guidelines
range of 57-71 months, limited by the statutory maximum term of imprisonment referenced in
Paragraph 7.

11. The parties agree that notwithstanding the partiesâ Agreement herein, the Court is

not bound by any stipulation entered into by the parties but may, with the aid of the presentence

12
Case 1:19-cr-00008-SOM Document 10 Filed 01/22/19 Page13o0f20 PagelD #: 43

report, determine the facts relevant to sentencing. The parties understand that the Courtâs
rejection of any stipulation between the parties does not constitute a refusal to accept this
Agreement since the Court is expressly not bound by stipulations between the parties.

12. The parties represent that as of the date of this agreement there are no material
facts in dispute.

APPEAL/COLLATERAL REVIEW

13. The Defendant is aware that he has the right to appeal his conviction and the
sentence imposed. The Defendant knowingly waives the right to appeal, except as indicated in
subparagraph âbâ below, his conviction and any sentence within the Guidelines range as
determined by the Court at the time of sentencing, and any restitution order imposed, or the
manner in which the sentence or restitution order was determined, on any ground whatsoever, in
exchange for the concessions made by the prosecution in this Agreement. The Defendant
understands that this waiver includes, but is not limited to, the right to assert any constitutional
challenges to the Defendantâs conviction and guilty plea on appeal or collateral review, including
any arguments that the statute or statutes to which the Defendant is pleading guilty are
unconstitutional, and any claims that the statement of facts provided in this Agreement is
insufficient to support the Defendantâs guilty plea.

a. The Defendant also waives the right to challenge his conviction or
sentence or the manner in which it was determined in any collateral attack, including, but not
limited to, a motion brought under Title 28, United States Code, Section 2255, except that the
Defendant may make such a challenge (1) as indicated in subparagraph âbâ below, or (2) based

on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.

13
Case 1:19-cr-00008-SOM Document 10 Filed 01/22/19 Page14of20 PagelD # 44

b. If the Court imposes a sentence greater than specified in the guideline
range determined by the Court to be applicable to the Defendant, the Defendant retains the right
to appeal the portion of his sentence greater than specified in that guideline range and the manner
in which that portion was determined and to challenge that portion of his sentence in a collateral
attack.

Cc. The prosecution retains its right to appeal the sentence and the manner in
which it was determined on any of the grounds stated in Title 18, United States Code, Section
3742(b).

FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
14. In connection with the collection of restitution or other financial obligations that
may be imposed upon him, the Defendant agrees as follows:

a. The Defendant agrees to fully disclose all assets in which he has any
interest or over which the Defendant exercises control, directly or indirectly, including those held
by a spouse, nominee or third party. The Defendant agrees to truthfully complete the financial
statement form provided to the Defendant in connection with this Agreement by the earlier of 45
days from the Defendantâs signature on this Agreement or the date of the Defendantâs entry of a
guilty plea, sign it under penalty of perjury, and provide it to both the United States Attorneyâs
Office and the United States Probation Office. The Defendant agrees to provide updates with
any material changes in circumstances, as described in Title 18, United States Code, Section
3664(k), which occur prior to sentencing, within seven days of the event giving rise to the

changed circumstances. The Defendant's failure to timely and accurately complete and sign the

14
Case 1:19-cr-00008-SOM Document10 Filed 01/22/19 Page1Sof20 PagelD # 45

financial statement, and any update thereto, may, in addition to any other penalty or remedy,
constitute the Defendantâs failure to accept responsibility under U.S.S.G Â§ 3E1.1.

b. The Defendant expressly authorizes the Department of Justice to obtain a
credit report on him. The Defendant also authorizes the Department of Justice to inspect and
copy all financial documents and information held by the United States Probation Office.

c Prior to sentencing, the Defendant agrees to notify the U.S. Department of
Justice, Criminal Division, Fraud Section before making any transfer of an interest in property
with a value exceeding $1,000 owned directly or indirectly, individually or jointly, by the
Defendant, including any interest held or owned under any name, including trusts, partnerships
and corporations.

IMPOSITION OF SENTENCE

15. The Defendant understands that the District Court in imposing sentence will
consider the provisions of the Sentencing Guidelines. The Defendant agrees that there is no
promise or guarantee of the applicability or non-applicability of any Guideline or any portion
thereof, notwithstanding any representations or predictions from any source.

16. | The Defendant understands that this Agreement will not be accepted or rejected
by the Court until there has been an opportunity by the Court to consider a presentence report,
unless the Court decides that a presentence report is unnecessary. The Defendant understands
that the Court will not accept an agreement unless the Court determines that the remaining
charge adequately reflects the seriousness of the actual offense behavior and accepting the

Agreement will not undermine the statutory purposes of sentencing.

15
Case 1:19-cr-00008-SOM Document 10 Filed 01/22/19 Page 16o0f20 PagelD # 46

WAIVER OF TRIAL RIGHTS
17. The Defendant understands that by pleading guilty he surrenders certain rights,
including the following:

a. If the Defendant persisted in a plea of not guilty to the charges against
him, then he would have the right to a public and speedy trial. The trial could be either a jury
trial or a trial by a judge sitting without a jury. The Defendant has a right to a jury trial.
However, in order that the trial be conducted by the judge sitting without a jury, the Defendant,
the prosecution, and the judge all must agree that the trial be conducted by the judge without a
Jury.

b. If the trial is a jury trial, the jury would be composed of twelve laypersons
selected at random. The Defendant and his attorney would have a say in who the jurors would
be by removing prospective jurors for cause where actual bias or other disqualification is shown,
or without cause by exercising peremptory challenges. The jury would have to agree
unanimously before it could return a verdict of either guilty or not guilty. The jury would be
instructed that the Defendant is presumed innocent, and that it could not convict him unless, after
hearing all the evidence, it was persuaded of his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

C: If the trial is held by a judge without a jury, the judge would find the facts
and determine, after hearing all the evidence, whether or not he or she was persuaded of the
Defendantâs guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

d. Ata trial, whether by a jury or a judge, the prosecution would be required
to present its witnesses and other evidence against the Defendant. The Defendant would be able

to confront those prosecution witnesses and his attorney would be able to cross-examine them.

16
Case 1:19-cr-00008-SOM Document 10 Filed 01/22/19 Page17of20 PagelD #: 47

In turn, the Defendant could present witnesses and other evidence on his own behalf. If the
witnesses for the Defendant would not appear voluntarily, the Defendant could require their
attendance through the subpoena power of the Court.

e. Ata trial, the Defendant would have a privilege against self-incrimination
so that he could decline to testify, and no inference of guilt could be drawn from his refusal to
testify.

18. | The Defendant understands that by pleading guilty, he is waiving all of the rights
set forth in the preceding paragraph. The Defendantâs attorney has explained those rights to
him, and the consequences of the waiver of those rights.

USE OF PLEA STATEMENTS

19. If, after signing this Agreement, the Defendant decides not to plead guilty as
provided herein, or if the Defendant pleads guilty but subsequently makes a motion before the
Court to withdraw his guilty plea and the Court grants that motion, the Defendant agrees that any
admission of guilt that he makes by signing this Agreement, that he makes while pleading guilty
as set forth in this Agreement, or that were made to the Government on or after December 12,
2018 may be used against him in a subsequent trial if the Defendant later proceeds to trial. The
Defendant voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waives any protection afforded by Rule 11(f)
of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and Rule 410 of the Federal Rules of Evidence
regarding the use of statements made in this Agreement, during the course of pleading guilty, or
that were made to the Government on or after December 12, 2018 when the guilty plea is later

withdrawn. The only exception to this paragraph is where the Defendant fully complies with

17
Case 1:19-cr-00008-SOM Document 10 Filed 01/22/19 Page18of20 PagelD #: 48

this Agreement but the Court nonetheless rejects it. Under those circumstances, the United
States may not use those statements of the Defendant for any purpose.

20. The Defendant understands that the prosecution will apprise the Court and the
United States Probation Office of the nature, scope and extent of the Defendantâs conduct
regarding the charges against him, related matters, and any matters in aggravation or mitigation
relevant to the issues involved in sentencing.

21. The Defendant and his attorney acknowledge that, apart from any written proffer
agreements, if applicable, no threats, promises, agreements or conditions have been entered into
by the parties other than those set forth in this Agreement, to induce the Defendant to plead
guilty. Apart from any written proffer agreements, if applicable, this Agreement supersedes all
prior promises, agreements or conditions between the parties.

22. The Defendant agrees that he will fully cooperate with the United States.

a. He agrees to testify truthfully at any and all trials, hearings, or any other
proceedings at which the prosecution requests him to testify, including, but not limited to, any
grand jury proceedings, trial proceedings involving co-defendants and others indicted later in the
investigation, and related civil proceedings.

b. The Defendant agrees to be available to speak with law enforcement
officials and other representatives of the Department of Justice at any time and to give truthful
and complete answers at such meetings, but he understands he may have his counsel present at
those conversations, if he so desires.

c. The Defendant agrees he will not assert any privilege to refuse to testify at

any grand jury, trial, or other proceeding, involving or related to the crimes in this Information or

18
Case 1:19-cr-00008-SOM Document10 Filed 01/22/19 Page19o0f20 PagelD #: 49

any subsequent charges related to this investigation, at which the prosecution requests him to
testify.

d. Pursuant to Section 1B1.8(a) of the Sentencing Guidelines, the
prosecution agrees that self-incriminating information provided pursuant to this Agreement to
cooperate will not be used in determining the applicable guideline range, except as may be
provided in this Agreement and under Section 1B1.8(b) of the Sentencing Guidelines.

23. In the event that the Defendant does not breach any of the terms of this agreement
but the Court nonetheless refuses to accept the Agreement after the Defendant has made
statements to law enforcement officials as set forth in paragraph 21(b) of this Agreement, the
prosecution agrees not to use said statements in its case-in-chief in the trial of the Defendant in
this matter. The Defendant understands that this does not bar the use of information and
evidence derived from said statements or prohibit the use of the statements by the prosecution in
cross-examination or rebuttal.

24. Pursuant to Guideline Section 5K1.1 and Rule 35(b), Federal Rules of Criminal
Procedure, the prosecution may move the Court to depart from the Guidelines on the ground that
the Defendant has provided substantial assistance to authorities in the investigation or
prosecution of another person who has committed an offense, or in the investigation of other
activities deemed by the United States Department of Justice to be of interest and value to United
States law enforcement. The Defendant understands that:

a. The decision as to whether to make such a request or motion is entirely

within the discretion of the government.

19
.Case 1:19-cr-00008-SOM Document 10 Filed 01/22/19 Page 200f20 PagelD #: 50

b. This Agreement does not require the government to make such a request
or motion.

Cs This Agreement confers neither any right upon the Defendant to have the
government make such a request or motion, nor any remedy to the Defendant in the event the
government fails to make such a request or motion.

d. Even in the event that the government makes such a request or motion, the
Court may refuse to depart from the Advisory Guidelines established by statute.

25. To become effective, this Agreement must be signed by all signatories listed

below.
26. Should the Court refuse to accept this Agreement, it is null and void and neither
party shall be bound thereto.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Tuesday, February 12, 2019

Micronesian Government Official Arrested in Money Laundering Scheme Involving Foreign Bribery

U.S. Executive Previously Pleaded Guilty

Charges were unsealed yesterday against a Micronesian government official for his alleged participation in a money laundering scheme
involving bribes made to corruptly secure engineering and project management contracts from the government of the Federated States of
Micronesia (FSM). In a related matter, on Jan. 22, a U.S. executive pleaded guilty for his role in a scheme to, among other things, bribe the
Micronesian official in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).

Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division and Special Agent in Charge Sean Kaul of the
FBIâs Honolulu Field Office made the announcement.

Master Halbert, 44, a Micronesian citizen, was charged in a criminal complaint filed in the District of Hawaii with one count of conspiracy to
commit money laundering. Halbert was arrested yesterday in Honolulu, Hawaii, and had his initial court appearance before U.S. Magistrate
Judge Richard L. Puglisi of the District of Hawaii. Halbert is scheduled to have a pretrial detention hearing on Feb. 13 and a preliminary hearing
on Feb. 22.

According to the criminal complaint, Halbert was a government official in the FSM Department of Transportation, Communications and
Infrastructure who administered FSMâs aviation programs, including the management of its airports. The complaint alleges that between 2006
and 2016, a Hawaii-based engineering and consulting company owned by Frank James Lyon paid bribes to FSM officials, including Halbert, to
obtain and retain contracts with the FSM government valued at nearly $8 million. According to the complaint, Lyon entered into an agreement
with Halbert to bribe Halbert in exchange for Halbertâs assistance in securing contracts for Lyon and his company. Lyon and Halbert allegedly
agreed that these bribes would be transported from the United States to FSM.

The charges contained in the complaint are merely allegations and the defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable
doubt in a court of law.

In the related matter, Lyon, 53, of Honolulu, Hawaii, pleaded guilty on Jan. 22 to a one-count information filed in the District of Hawaii charging
him with conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA and to commit federal program fraud. Lyon is scheduled to be sentenced
on May 13.

Trial Attorney Katherine Raut of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section is prosecuting the case. The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International
Affairs also provided assistance.

The Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the departmentâs FCPA
enforcement efforts can be found at www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.

MEMORANDUM OF PLEA AGREEMENT
Pursuant to Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA, by its attorney, the Assistant Attorney General of the Criminal Division, and the
Defendant, FRANK JAMES LYON, and his attorney, Erika Amatore, have agreed upon the
following:
THE CHARGES
1. The Defendant acknowledges that he has been charged in an Information with

violating Title 18, United States Code, Section 371.
,Case 1:19-cr-00008-SOM Document 10 Filed 01/22/19 Page2of20 PagelD #32

2. The Defendant has read the charge against him contained in the Information, and
that charge has been fully explained to him by his attorney.

3: The Defendant fully understands the nature and elements of the crime with which
he has been charged.

THE AGREEMENT

4. The Defendant agrees to waive indictment and enter a voluntary plea of guilty to
the Information, which charges him with conspiring to (1) violate the anti-bribery provisions of
the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (âFCPAâ), Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2, and
(2) pay a bribe to an agent of an organization receiving federal funds in violation of Title 18,
United States Code, Section 666(a)(2). The Defendant is aware that he has the right to have this
felony asserted against him by way of grand jury indictment. The Defendant hereby waives this
right and consents that this offense may be charged against him by way of the Information. In
return, the government agrees not to file additional charges against the Defendant relating to (a)
any of the conduct described in the Factual Stipulations, or (b) information made known to the
government prior to the date of this Agreement.

5. The Defendant agrees that this Memorandum of Plea Agreement shall be filed and
become part of the record in this case.

6. The Defendant enters this plea because he is in fact guilty of conspiring to violate
the FCPA and to pay a bribe to an agent of an organization receiving federal funds as charged in

the Information, and he agrees that this plea is voluntary and not the result of force or threats.

count to which the Defendant is pleading guilty. The Defendant agrees to pay $100 for each
count to which he is pleading guilty to the District Courtâs Clerkâs Office, to be credited to said
special assessments, before the commencement of any portion of sentencing. The Defendant
acknowledges that failure to make such full advance payment in a form and manner acceptable
to the prosecution will allow, though not require, the prosecution to withdraw from this
Agreement at its option.

approximately $7.8 million with the FSM government, including for an airport improvement
project funded in large part by the United States Federal Aviation Administration (âFAA AIP

,Case 1:19-cr-00008-SOM Document10 Filed 01/22/19 PageS5of20 PagelD #35

J From in or around 2011 through in or around 2016, the Defendant,

Company to make corrupt payments to a relative of Co-Conspirator 3, totaling approximately
$24,000, purportedly for services provided to Engineering Company by the relative of Co-
Conspirator 3. However, the relative of Co-Conspirator 3 did not provide any services to
Engineering Company. The purpose of the payments was for Co-Conspirator 3âs participation
in influencing the award of a State Agency contract in favor of Engineering Company. During
this period, Co-Conspirator 3 was an employee of State Agency.

q. The Defendant, together with his co-conspirators, caused Engineering
Company to make corrupt payments to Co-Conspirator 3, totaling approximately $132,500,

the award of a State Agency contract in favor of Engineering Company.

r. On or about December 28, 2010, the Defendant sent an email to Co-
Conspirator 2 regarding Engineering Companyâs purchase of travel relating to the FAA AIP
Contract and an unrelated side trip to Las Vegas, Nevada, including for Micronesian Official 1
and his wife. The Defendant stated that the side trip would be expensive, but also stated, âThis
is a huge (and very very very critical to get renewed) contract so I am not trying to save money â
or god forbid â insult [Micronesian Official 1].â

s. On or about December 28, 2010, Co-Conspirator 2 sent an email in reply
to the email in Paragraph 8(r), in which Co-Conspirator 2 stated that the Engineering Company
employees on the trip could charge their trip to the FAA AIP Contract, concealing the Las Vegas

side trip, but collecting per diem during that time.
,Case 1:19-cr-00008-SOM Document10 Filed 01/22/19 Page7of20 PagelD #37

t. On or about December 28, 2010, Co-Conspirator 2 replied again to the

you are done.â

u. On or about March 31, 2011, the Defendant and his co-conspirators
caused Engineering Company to make a corrupt payment of $4,000 to a relative of Co-
Conspirator 3, purportedly for consulting services, when in fact the payment was intended to
compensate Co-Conspirator 3 for influencing the award of a State Agency contract in favor of
Engineering Company.

v. In or around 2012, before State Agency awarded a contract to Engineering
Company, the Defendant entered into an agreement with Co-Conspirator 3 whereby, after State
Agency awarded the contract to Engineering Company, the Defendant would cause a portion of
the State Agency contract payments to Engineering Company to be paid periodically to Co-
Conspirator 3 to benefit Co-Conspirator 3 and certain State Agency officials who would have
influenced the award of the State Agency contract to Engineering Company.

w. In or around 2012, Co-Conspirator 3 and certain State Agency officials
caused State Agency to award a $2.5 million contract to Engineering Company in fulfillment of
the corrupt agreement referenced in Paragraph 8(v).

x. In or around 2012, after Engineering Company was awarded the $2.5
million State Agency contract, the Defendant met with Co-Conspirator 3 in the District of

9. Pursuant to CrimLR 32.1(a) of the Local Rules of the United States District Court
for the District of Hawaii, the parties agree that the charge to which the Defendant is pleading
guilty adequately reflects the seriousness of the actual offense behavior and that accepting this
Agreement will not undermine the statutory purposes of sentencing.

SENTENCING STIPULATIONS

10. Pursuant to CrimLR 32.1(b) of the Local Rules of the United States District Court
for the District of Hawaii and Section 6B1.4 of the Sentencing Guidelines, the parties stipulate to
the following for the purpose of the sentencing of the Defendant in connection with this matter:

a. Base offense level: Pursuant to U.S.S.G. Â§ 2C1.1(a)(2), that the base
offense level for purposes of sentencing guideline calculations for the charged offense is 12;

b. That a 14-level enhancement of the guideline offense level applies under
U.S.S.G. Â§ 2B1.1 since the offense involved a benefit received of more than $550,000.

c. That a two-level increase to the offense level applies since the offense
involved more than one bribe pursuant to U.S.S.G. Â§ 2C1.1(b)(1);

d. As of the date of this agreement, it is expected that Defendant will enter a

plea of guilty prior to the commencement of trial, will truthfully admit his involvement in the

11
Case 1:19-cr-00008-SOM Document10 Filed 01/22/19 Page12of20 PagelD #: 42

offense and related conduct, and will not engage in conduct that is inconsistent with such
acceptance of responsibility. If all of these events occur, and Defendantâs acceptance of
responsibility continues through the date of sentencing, a downward adjustment of 2 levels for
acceptance of responsibility will be appropriate. See U.S.S.G. Â§ 3E1.1(a) and Application Note
3.

e The Government agrees that the Defendantâs agreement herein to enter
into a guilty plea constitutes notice of intent to plead guilty in a timely manner, so as to permit
the government to avoid preparing for trial as to the Defendant. Accordingly, the Government
anticipates moving in the Governmentâs Sentencing Statement for a one-level reduction in
sentencing offense level pursuant to Guideline Â§ 3E1.1(b)(2), if the Defendant is otherwise
eligible. The Defendant understands that notwithstanding its present intentions, and still within
the Agreement, the prosecution reserves the rights (1) to argue to the contrary in the event of
receipt of new information relating to those issues, and (2) to call and examine witnesses on
those issues in the event that either the United States Probation Office finds to the contrary of the
prosecutionâs intentions or the Court requests that evidence be presented on those issues.

f. The Defendant has a Criminal History Category of I.

g. Although not binding on the probation office or the Court, the parties
agree that the Defendantâs total offense level is likely to be 25, which corresponds to a guidelines
range of 57-71 months, limited by the statutory maximum term of imprisonment referenced in
Paragraph 7.

11. The parties agree that notwithstanding the partiesâ Agreement herein, the Court is

not bound by any stipulation entered into by the parties but may, with the aid of the presentence

12
Case 1:19-cr-00008-SOM Document 10 Filed 01/22/19 Page13o0f20 PagelD #: 43

report, determine the facts relevant to sentencing. The parties understand that the Courtâs
rejection of any stipulation between the parties does not constitute a refusal to accept this
Agreement since the Court is expressly not bound by stipulations between the parties.

12. The parties represent that as of the date of this agreement there are no material
facts in dispute.

APPEAL/COLLATERAL REVIEW

13. The Defendant is aware that he has the right to appeal his conviction and the
sentence imposed. The Defendant knowingly waives the right to appeal, except as indicated in
subparagraph âbâ below, his conviction and any sentence within the Guidelines range as
determined by the Court at the time of sentencing, and any restitution order imposed, or the
manner in which the sentence or restitution order was determined, on any ground whatsoever, in
exchange for the concessions made by the prosecution in this Agreement. The Defendant
understands that this waiver includes, but is not limited to, the right to assert any constitutional
challenges to the Defendantâs conviction and guilty plea on appeal or collateral review, including
any arguments that the statute or statutes to which the Defendant is pleading guilty are
unconstitutional, and any claims that the statement of facts provided in this Agreement is
insufficient to support the Defendantâs guilty plea.

a. The Defendant also waives the right to challenge his conviction or
sentence or the manner in which it was determined in any collateral attack, including, but not
limited to, a motion brought under Title 28, United States Code, Section 2255, except that the
Defendant may make such a challenge (1) as indicated in subparagraph âbâ below, or (2) based

on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.

13
Case 1:19-cr-00008-SOM Document 10 Filed 01/22/19 Page14of20 PagelD # 44

b. If the Court imposes a sentence greater than specified in the guideline
range determined by the Court to be applicable to the Defendant, the Defendant retains the right
to appeal the portion of his sentence greater than specified in that guideline range and the manner
in which that portion was determined and to challenge that portion of his sentence in a collateral
attack.

Cc. The prosecution retains its right to appeal the sentence and the manner in
which it was determined on any of the grounds stated in Title 18, United States Code, Section
3742(b).

FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
14. In connection with the collection of restitution or other financial obligations that
may be imposed upon him, the Defendant agrees as follows:

a. The Defendant agrees to fully disclose all assets in which he has any
interest or over which the Defendant exercises control, directly or indirectly, including those held
by a spouse, nominee or third party. The Defendant agrees to truthfully complete the financial
statement form provided to the Defendant in connection with this Agreement by the earlier of 45
days from the Defendantâs signature on this Agreement or the date of the Defendantâs entry of a
guilty plea, sign it under penalty of perjury, and provide it to both the United States Attorneyâs
Office and the United States Probation Office. The Defendant agrees to provide updates with
any material changes in circumstances, as described in Title 18, United States Code, Section
3664(k), which occur prior to sentencing, within seven days of the event giving rise to the

changed circumstances. The Defendant's failure to timely and accurately complete and sign the

14
Case 1:19-cr-00008-SOM Document10 Filed 01/22/19 Page1Sof20 PagelD # 45

financial statement, and any update thereto, may, in addition to any other penalty or remedy,
constitute the Defendantâs failure to accept responsibility under U.S.S.G Â§ 3E1.1.

b. The Defendant expressly authorizes the Department of Justice to obtain a
credit report on him. The Defendant also authorizes the Department of Justice to inspect and
copy all financial documents and information held by the United States Probation Office.

c Prior to sentencing, the Defendant agrees to notify the U.S. Department of
Justice, Criminal Division, Fraud Section before making any transfer of an interest in property
with a value exceeding $1,000 owned directly or indirectly, individually or jointly, by the
Defendant, including any interest held or owned under any name, including trusts, partnerships
and corporations.

IMPOSITION OF SENTENCE

15. The Defendant understands that the District Court in imposing sentence will
consider the provisions of the Sentencing Guidelines. The Defendant agrees that there is no
promise or guarantee of the applicability or non-applicability of any Guideline or any portion
thereof, notwithstanding any representations or predictions from any source.

16. | The Defendant understands that this Agreement will not be accepted or rejected
by the Court until there has been an opportunity by the Court to consider a presentence report,
unless the Court decides that a presentence report is unnecessary. The Defendant understands
that the Court will not accept an agreement unless the Court determines that the remaining
charge adequately reflects the seriousness of the actual offense behavior and accepting the

Agreement will not undermine the statutory purposes of sentencing.

15
Case 1:19-cr-00008-SOM Document 10 Filed 01/22/19 Page 16o0f20 PagelD # 46

WAIVER OF TRIAL RIGHTS
17. The Defendant understands that by pleading guilty he surrenders certain rights,
including the following:

a. If the Defendant persisted in a plea of not guilty to the charges against
him, then he would have the right to a public and speedy trial. The trial could be either a jury
trial or a trial by a judge sitting without a jury. The Defendant has a right to a jury trial.
However, in order that the trial be conducted by the judge sitting without a jury, the Defendant,
the prosecution, and the judge all must agree that the trial be conducted by the judge without a
Jury.

b. If the trial is a jury trial, the jury would be composed of twelve laypersons
selected at random. The Defendant and his attorney would have a say in who the jurors would
be by removing prospective jurors for cause where actual bias or other disqualification is shown,
or without cause by exercising peremptory challenges. The jury would have to agree
unanimously before it could return a verdict of either guilty or not guilty. The jury would be
instructed that the Defendant is presumed innocent, and that it could not convict him unless, after
hearing all the evidence, it was persuaded of his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

C: If the trial is held by a judge without a jury, the judge would find the facts
and determine, after hearing all the evidence, whether or not he or she was persuaded of the
Defendantâs guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

d. Ata trial, whether by a jury or a judge, the prosecution would be required
to present its witnesses and other evidence against the Defendant. The Defendant would be able

to confront those prosecution witnesses and his attorney would be able to cross-examine them.

16
Case 1:19-cr-00008-SOM Document 10 Filed 01/22/19 Page17of20 PagelD #: 47

In turn, the Defendant could present witnesses and other evidence on his own behalf. If the
witnesses for the Defendant would not appear voluntarily, the Defendant could require their
attendance through the subpoena power of the Court.

e. Ata trial, the Defendant would have a privilege against self-incrimination
so that he could decline to testify, and no inference of guilt could be drawn from his refusal to
testify.

18. | The Defendant understands that by pleading guilty, he is waiving all of the rights
set forth in the preceding paragraph. The Defendantâs attorney has explained those rights to
him, and the consequences of the waiver of those rights.

USE OF PLEA STATEMENTS

19. If, after signing this Agreement, the Defendant decides not to plead guilty as
provided herein, or if the Defendant pleads guilty but subsequently makes a motion before the
Court to withdraw his guilty plea and the Court grants that motion, the Defendant agrees that any
admission of guilt that he makes by signing this Agreement, that he makes while pleading guilty
as set forth in this Agreement, or that were made to the Government on or after December 12,
2018 may be used against him in a subsequent trial if the Defendant later proceeds to trial. The
Defendant voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waives any protection afforded by Rule 11(f)
of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and Rule 410 of the Federal Rules of Evidence
regarding the use of statements made in this Agreement, during the course of pleading guilty, or
that were made to the Government on or after December 12, 2018 when the guilty plea is later

withdrawn. The only exception to this paragraph is where the Defendant fully complies with

17
Case 1:19-cr-00008-SOM Document 10 Filed 01/22/19 Page18of20 PagelD #: 48

this Agreement but the Court nonetheless rejects it. Under those circumstances, the United
States may not use those statements of the Defendant for any purpose.

20. The Defendant understands that the prosecution will apprise the Court and the
United States Probation Office of the nature, scope and extent of the Defendantâs conduct
regarding the charges against him, related matters, and any matters in aggravation or mitigation
relevant to the issues involved in sentencing.

21. The Defendant and his attorney acknowledge that, apart from any written proffer
agreements, if applicable, no threats, promises, agreements or conditions have been entered into
by the parties other than those set forth in this Agreement, to induce the Defendant to plead
guilty. Apart from any written proffer agreements, if applicable, this Agreement supersedes all
prior promises, agreements or conditions between the parties.

22. The Defendant agrees that he will fully cooperate with the United States.

a. He agrees to testify truthfully at any and all trials, hearings, or any other
proceedings at which the prosecution requests him to testify, including, but not limited to, any
grand jury proceedings, trial proceedings involving co-defendants and others indicted later in the
investigation, and related civil proceedings.

b. The Defendant agrees to be available to speak with law enforcement
officials and other representatives of the Department of Justice at any time and to give truthful
and complete answers at such meetings, but he understands he may have his counsel present at
those conversations, if he so desires.

c. The Defendant agrees he will not assert any privilege to refuse to testify at

any grand jury, trial, or other proceeding, involving or related to the crimes in this Information or

18
Case 1:19-cr-00008-SOM Document10 Filed 01/22/19 Page19o0f20 PagelD #: 49

any subsequent charges related to this investigation, at which the prosecution requests him to
testify.

d. Pursuant to Section 1B1.8(a) of the Sentencing Guidelines, the
prosecution agrees that self-incriminating information provided pursuant to this Agreement to
cooperate will not be used in determining the applicable guideline range, except as may be
provided in this Agreement and under Section 1B1.8(b) of the Sentencing Guidelines.

23. In the event that the Defendant does not breach any of the terms of this agreement
but the Court nonetheless refuses to accept the Agreement after the Defendant has made
statements to law enforcement officials as set forth in paragraph 21(b) of this Agreement, the
prosecution agrees not to use said statements in its case-in-chief in the trial of the Defendant in
this matter. The Defendant understands that this does not bar the use of information and
evidence derived from said statements or prohibit the use of the statements by the prosecution in
cross-examination or rebuttal.

24. Pursuant to Guideline Section 5K1.1 and Rule 35(b), Federal Rules of Criminal
Procedure, the prosecution may move the Court to depart from the Guidelines on the ground that
the Defendant has provided substantial assistance to authorities in the investigation or
prosecution of another person who has committed an offense, or in the investigation of other
activities deemed by the United States Department of Justice to be of interest and value to United
States law enforcement. The Defendant understands that:

a. The decision as to whether to make such a request or motion is entirely

within the discretion of the government.

19
.Case 1:19-cr-00008-SOM Document 10 Filed 01/22/19 Page 200f20 PagelD #: 50

b. This Agreement does not require the government to make such a request
or motion.

Cs This Agreement confers neither any right upon the Defendant to have the
government make such a request or motion, nor any remedy to the Defendant in the event the
government fails to make such a request or motion.

d. Even in the event that the government makes such a request or motion, the
Court may refuse to depart from the Advisory Guidelines established by statute.

25. To become effective, this Agreement must be signed by all signatories listed

below.
26. Should the Court refuse to accept this Agreement, it is null and void and neither
party shall be bound thereto.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Tuesday, May 14, 2019

U.S. Executive Sentenced to Prison for Role in Conspiracy to Violate Foreign Corrupt Practices Act

The owner of a Hawaii-based engineering and consulting company was sentenced to 30 months in prison yesterday for his involvement in an
international bribery conspiracy, announced Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division and
Special Agent in Charge Sean Kaul of the FBIâs Honolulu Field Office.

Frank James Lyon, 53, a U.S. citizen residing in Hawaii, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Susan O. Mollway of the District of Hawaii. Lyon
pleaded guilty on Jan. 22 to a one-count information filed in the District of Hawaii charging him with conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery
provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and to commit federal program fraud.

According to admissions made as part of his plea agreement, between 2006 and 2016, Lyon and his co-conspirators paid bribes to foreign
officials in the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) and to Hawaii state officials in exchange for those officialsâ assisting Lyonâs company in
obtaining and retaining contracts valued at more than $10 million. The bribes included, among other things, cash to FSM officials and Hawaii
officials, and vehicles, gifts and entertainment for FSM officials.

In a related matter, Master Halbert, 44, a Micronesian citizen and government official, pleaded guilty on April 2, before Judge Mollway to one
count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. He is scheduled to be sentenced on July 29, 2019.

Trial Attorney Katherine Raut of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section is prosecuting the case. The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International
Affairs and the U.S. Department of Transportation Office of Inspector General provided significant assistance.

The Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the departmentâs FCPA
enforcement efforts can be found at www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.

PLEA AGREEMENT
The United States Department of Justice, Criminal Division,

Fraud Section and Money Laundering & Asset Recovery Section

(collectively, the âGovernmentâ or the âUnited Statesâ), and Frank
Roberto Chatburn Ripalda (hereinafter referred to as the
âdefendantâ) enter into the following agreement:

1. The defendant agrees to plead guilty to Count 2 of the
superseding indictment in this case, charging him with conspiracy
to commit money laundering in violation of 18 U.S.C. Â§ 1956(h).

2. The defendant is aware that the sentence will be imposed
by the Court after considering the Federal Sentencing Guidelines
and Policy Statements (hereinafter the âSentencing Guidelinesâ),
as well as other factors enumerated in Title 18, United States
Code, Section 3553(a). The defendant acknowledges and understands

that the Court will compute an advisory sentence under the

release of up to five years. In addition to a term of imprisonment
and supervised release, the Court may impose a fine of up to
$500,000, or twice the value of the property involved in the
transactions for which the defendant conspired to launder,
whichever is greater, and the Court may also order forfeiture and
restitution.

4. The defendant further understands and acknowledges that,
in addition to any sentence imposed under paragraph 3 of this
agreement, a special assessment in the amount of $100 per count
will be imposed on the defendant. The defendant agrees that any
special assessment imposed shall be paid at the time of sentencing.
If the defendant is financially unable to pay the special
assessment, the defendant agrees to present evidence to the
Government and the Court at the time of sentencing as to the
reasons for the defendantâs failure to pay.

5. The Government reserves the right to inform the Court and
the probation office of all facts pertinent to the sentencing
process, including all relevant information concerning the
offenses committed, whether charged or not, as well as concerning
the defendant and the defendantâs background. Subject only to the
express terms of any agreed-upon sentencing recommendations
contained in this agreement, the Government further reserves the
right to make any recommendation as to the guality and quantity of

punishment.
Case 1:18-cr-20312-MGC Document 212 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/11/2019 Page 4 of 16

6. The Government agrees to recommend at sentencing that the
Court reduce by two levels the sentencing guideline level
applicable to the defendantâs offense, pursuant to Section
B3E1l.1(a) of the Sentencing Guidelines, based upon the defendantâs
recognition and affirmative acceptance of personal responsibility.
If at the time of sentencing the defendantâs offense level is
determined to be 16 or greater, the Government will make a motion
requesting an additional one-level decrease pursuant to Section
BE1.1(b) of the Sentencing Guidelines, stating that the defendant
has assisted authorities in the investigation or prosecution of
his own misconduct by timely notifying authorities of his intention
to enter a plea of guilty, thereby permitting the Government to
avoid preparing for trial and permitting the Government and the
Court to allocate their resources efficiently. The Government,
however, will not be reguired to make this motion and this
recommendation if the defendant: (1) fails or refuses to make a
full, accurate, and complete disclosure to the probation office of
the circumstances surrounding the relevant offense conduct; (2) is
found to have misrepresented facts to the Government prior to
entering into this plea agreement; or (3) commits any misconduct
after entering into this plea agreement, including but not limited
to committing a state or federal offense, violating any term of
release, or making false statements or misrepresentations to any

governmental entity or official.
Case 1:18-cr-20312-MGC Document 212 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/11/2019 Page 5 of 16

7. The Government and the defendant agree that, although
not binding on the probation office or the Court, they will jointly
recommend that the Court make the following findings and
conclusions as to the sentence to be imposed. The parties agree
not to recommend or advocate for any other guideline enhancements
or departures.

a. Base offense level: Pursuant to U.S.S.G. Â§ 2S51.1(a) (1),

 

that the base offense level for purposes of sentencing guideline
calculations for the charged offenses is 12 (see Â§ 2C1.1) plus the
number of offense levels from the table in Â§ 2Bl1.1 corresponding
to the value of the unlawful payments/laundered funds (more than
$1.5 million and less than $3.5 million), adding 16 levels, for a
total base offense level of 28;

b. Offense of conviction: That a two-level increase to the

 

offense level applies under U.S.S.G. Â§ 251.1(b) (2) (B) for a
conviction under Title 18, United States Code, Section 1956;

c. Sophisticated means: That a two-level increase to the

 

offense level applies since the offense involved sophisticated

to Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, informing
the Court that the defendant has provided substantial assistance
and recommending that the defendantâs sentence be reduced. The
defendant understands and agrees, however, that nothing in this
agreement requires the Government to file any such motions, and
that the Governmentâs assessment of the quality and significance
of the defendantâs cooperation shall be binding as it relates to
the appropriateness of the filing or non-filing of a motion to
reduce sentence. In addition, because the defendant agrees that
the Government shall have sole and unreviewable discretion to move
for any sentencing reduction based on his cooperation, the
defendant agrees that he will not seek a variance from the
guideline range under Title 18, United States Code, Section 3553 (a)
because of any cooperation, although the defendant may move for a
variance, if he chooses, because of other grounds, if any, which
do not involve cooperation.

10. The defendant understands and acknowledges that the
Court is under no obligation to grant a motion for reduction of
sentence filed by the Government. In addition, the defendant
further understands and acknowledges that the Court is under no
obligation of any type to reduce the defendantâs sentence because
of the defendantâs cooperation.

ll. In the event that the defendant chooses to seek a

variance from the sentencing guideline range, the defendant
Case 1:18-cr-20312-MGC Document 212 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/11/2019 Page 8 of 16

further agrees that any such application shall be filed in writing
with the Court and served on the United States no later than the
deadline for submitting objections to the Pre-Sentence
Investigation Report stated in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure
32(f) (1).

12. The defendant agrees, in an individual and any other
capacity, to forfeit to the United States, voluntarily and
immediately, all rights, title, and interest to any property, real
or personal, involved in the violation of Title 18, United States
Code, Section 1956(h) or any property traceable to such property.
In addition, the defendant agrees to forfeiture of substitute
property pursuant to 21 U.S.C. Â§ 853(p). The property subject to
forfeiture includes, but is not limited to a forfeiture money
judgment of at least $870,924.20 in United States currency, which
sum represents the value of the property subject to forfeiture.
Forfeiture shall be paid by the time of sentencing.

13. The defendant further agrees that forfeiture is
independent of any assessment, fine, cost, restitution, or penalty
that may be imposed by the Court. The defendant knowingly and
voluntarily agrees to waive all constitutional, legal, and
equitable defenses to the forfeiture, including excessive fines
under the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. In
addition, the defendant agrees to waive: any applicable time

limits for administrative or judicial forfeiture proceedings, the
Case 1:18-cr-20312-MGC Document 212 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/11/2019 Page 9 of 16

requirements of Fed. R. Crim. P. 32.2 and 43(a}), and any appeal of
the forfeiture.

14. The defendant also agrees to fully and truthfully
disclose the existence, nature and location of all assets in which
the defendant has or had any direct or indirect financial interest
or control, and any assets involved in the offense of conviction.
The defendant also agrees to take all steps requested by the United
States for the recovery and forfeiture of all assets identified by
the United States as subject to forfeiture. This includes, but
1s not limited to, the delivery upon request of all necessary and
appropriate documentation to deliver good and marketable title,
consenting to all orders of forfeiture, and not contesting or
impeding in any way any criminal, civil or administrative
forfeiture proceedings concerning the forfeiture.

15. In furtherance of the collection of a forfeiture money
judgment and/or a restitution judgment, the defendant agrees to
the following:

(a) The defendant agrees to make full and
accurate disclosure of his financial affairs to the Government.
Specifically, within 14 calendar days from a request by the
Government, the defendant shall submit a completed Financial
Disclosure Statement (form provided by the Government), and shall
fully disclose and identify all assets in which the defendant has

any interest and/or over which the defendant exercises control,
Case 1:18-cr-20312-MGC Document 212 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/11/2019 Page 10 of 16

directly or indirectly, including those held by a spouse, nominee,
or other third party. Upon request by the Government, the
defendant agrees to provide in a timely manner all financial
information requested, including all financial information
provided to the United States Probation Office, and to meet in
person to identify assets which may be used to satisfy a forfeiture
money judgment and/or the restitution judgment.

(b) The defendant agrees to not sell, hide, waste,
encumber, destroy, or otherwise devalue any asset until the
forfeiture money judgment and the restitution judgment are paid in
full without prior approval of the United States. The defendant
shall also identify any transfer of assets valued in excess of
$5,000 since the commencement of the offense conduct to date,
including the identity of the asset, the value of the asset, the
identity of the third party to whom the asset was transferred, and
the current location of the asset.

(c) The defendant agrees to cooperate fully in the
investigation and the identification of assets to be applied toward
forfeiture and/or restitution. The defendant agrees that
providing false or incomplete information about assets, or hiding,
selling, transferring or devaluing assets and/or failing to
cooperate fully in the investigation and identification of assets
may be used as a basis for: (i) separate prosecution, including,

under 18 U.S.C. Â§ 1001; or (11) recommendation of a denial of a

10
Case 1:18-cr-20312-MGC Document 212 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/11/2019 Page 11 of 16

reduction for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to the United
States Sentencing Guidelines Â§ 3K1.1.

(d) The defendant further agrees to liquidate assets,
or complete any other tasks which may result in immediate payment
of the forfeiture money judgment and/or the restitution judgment
in full, or full payment in the shortest amount of time, as
requested by the United States.

(e) The defendant shall notify, within 30 days, the
Clerk of the Court for the Southern District of Florida and the
Government of: (1) any change of name, residence, or mailing
address, and (ii) any material change in economic circumstances
that affects the ability to pay the forfeiture.

16. The defendant is aware that Title 18, United States
Code, Section 3742 and Title 28, United States Code, Section 1291
afford the defendant the right to appeal the sentence imposed in
this case. Acknowledging this, in exchange for the undertakings
made by the United States in this plea agreement, the defendant
hereby waives all rights conferred by Sections 3742 and 1291 to
appeal any sentence imposed, including any restitution order, or
to appeal the manner in which the sentence was imposed, unless the
sentence exceeds the maximum permitted by statute or is the result
of an upward departure and/or an upward variance from the advisory
guideline range that the Court establishes at sentencing. The

defendant further understands that nothing in this agreement shall

11
Case 1:18-cr-20312-MGC Document 212 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/11/2019 Page 12 of 16

affect the Governmentâs right and/or duty to appeal as set forth
in Title 18, United States Code, Section 3742(b) and Title 28,
United States Code, Section 1291. However, if the United States
appeals the defendantâs sentence pursuant to Sections 3742(b) and
1291, the defendant shall be released from the above waiver of
appellate rights. In addition to the foregoing provisions, the
defendant hereby waives all rights to argue on appeal that the
statute to which the defendant is pleading guilty is
unconstitutional and that the admitted conduct does not fall within
the scope of the statute. By signing this agreement, the defendant
acknowledges that the defendant has discussed the appeal waiver
set forth in this agreement with the defendantâs attorney.

7. The defendant is aware that the sentence has not yet
been determined by the Court. The defendant also is aware that
any estimate of the probable sentencing range or sentence that the
defendant may receive, whether that estimate comes from the
defendantâs attorney, the Government, or the probation office, is
a prediction, not a promise, and is not binding on the Government,
the probation office, or the Court. The defendant understands
further that any recommendation that the Government makes to the
Court as to sentencing, whether pursuant to this agreement or
otherwise, is not binding on the Court, and the Court may disregard
the recommendation in its entirety. The defendant understands and

acknowledges, as previously acknowledged in paragraph 2 above,

12
Case 1:18-cr-20312-MGC Document 212 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/11/2019 Page 13 of 16

that the defendant may not withdraw his plea based upon the Courtâs
decision not to accept a sentencing recommendation made by the
defendant, the Government, or a recommendation made jointly by
both the defendant and the Government.

18. The Government and the defendant stipulate to and agree
not to contest the facts in the Factual Proffer, attached hereto
as Exhibit A, and stipulate that such facts, in accordance with
Rule 1l1i(b) (3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, provide
a sufficient factual basis for the plea of guilty in this case,
The defendant agrees that the facts in the Factual Proffer are
true and correct to the best of the defendantâs knowledge. The
factual basis set forth in the Factual Proffer does not purport to
represent all facts and circumstances relating to the defendantâs
participation in the crime to which he is pleading guilty.
Similarly, the factual basis in the Factual Proffer is not intended
to identify all of his unlawful activity or all of the knowledge
the defendant might have of the unlawful activity of other
individuals.

19. The defendant agrees that, effective as of the date the
defendant signs this Plea Agreement, and notwithstanding any other
subsequent event, including but not limited to the defendantâs
failure to plead guilty, the courtâs refusal to accept the
defendantâs guilty plea, or the defendantâs withdrawal (or

attempted withdrawal) of his guilty plea, the factual basis in the

13
Case 1:18-cr-20312-MGC Document 212 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/11/2019 Page 14 of 16

Factual Proffer set forth in connection with this Plea Agreement
shall be admissible against the defendant in any criminal case
involving the Fraud Section or the Money Laundering and Asset
Recovery Section and the defendant, as: (a) substantive evidence
offered by the government in its case-in-chief and rebuttal cases;
(bob) impeachment evidence offered by the government on cross-
examination; and (c) evidence at any sentencing hearing or other
hearing. In addition, the defendant also agrees not to assert any
claim under the United States Constitution, any statute, the
Federal Rules of Evidence (including Rule 410 of the Federal Rules
of Evidence), the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (including
Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure), or the United
States Sentencing Guidelines that the factual basis in the Factual
Proffer set forth in connection with this Plea Agreement should be
suppressed or is otherwise inadmissible as evidence (in any form).

20. The defendant recognizes that pleading guilty may have
consequences with respect to the defendantâs immigration status if
the defendant is not a citizen of the United States or if the
defendant is a naturalized citizen of the United States. Under
federal law, a broad range of crimes are removable offenses,
including the offense to which the defendant is pleading guilty.
Indeed, because the defendant is pleading guilty to a conspiracy
to launder money, removal is presumptively mandatory. Removal and

other immigration consequences are the subject of a separate

14
Case 1:18-cr-20312-MGC Document 212 Entered on FLSD Docket 10/11/2019 Page 15 of 16

proceeding, however, and defendant understands that no. one,
including the defendantâs attorney or the Court, can predict to a
certainty the effect of the defendantâs conviction on the
defendantâs immigration status. The defendant nevertheless
affirms that the defendant wants to plead guilty regardless of any
immigration consequences that the defendantâs plea may entail,
even if the consequence is the defendantâs automatic removal from
the United States.

21. This is the entire agreement and understanding between
the United States and the defendant. There are no other

agreements, promises, representations, or understandings.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Friday, October 11, 2019

Miami-Based Financial Advisor Pleads Guilty for Conspiring to Launder Money Relating To FCPA
and Ecuadorian Bribery Law Violations

A financial advisor based in Miami, Florida, pleaded guilty today to a money laundering conspiracy for his role in using the U.S. financial system
to launder money to promote violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and Ecuadorian bribery law violations and to conceal and
disguise the true nature of those illegal bribe payments. Specifically, this conspiracy related to a scheme to pay bribes to officials of Ecuadorâs
state-owned and state-controlled oil company, Empresa Publica de Hidrocarburos del Ecuador (PetroEcuador).

Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, Special Agent in Charge Kelly Jackson of the IRS-
Criminal Investigationâs (IRS-Cl) Washington, D.C. office, Special Agent in Charge Raymond Villanueva of U.S. Immigration and Customs
Enforcementâs Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Washington, D.C., office, and Special Agent in Charge George Piro of the FBIâs Miami Field
Office made the announcement.

Frank Roberto Chatburn Ripalda (Chatburn), 42, a dual U.S. and Ecuadorian citizen, pleaded guilty in federal district court in Miami before the
Honorable Marcia G. Cooke to one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, which carries a 20-year statutory maximum sentence.
Chatburn is scheduled to be sentenced by Judge Cooke on Dec. 18.

According to his admissions at the plea hearing, Chatburn conspired with an oil services contractor to pay nearly $3 million in bribes to
Ecuadorian government officials in an effort to obtain and retain contracts with PetroEcuador. As a financial advisor to the contractor, Chatburn
agreed to make bribe payments for the benefit of several then-PetroEcuador officials through the use of shell companies and bank accounts in
the United States, Panama, the Cayman Islands, Curacao and Switzerland. To conceal the bribe payments and to promote the scheme,
Chatburn established Panamanian shell companies with Swiss bank accounts on behalf of two then-PetroEcuador officials.

Chatburn further admitted that he conspired with another Ecuadorian government official to conceal bribe payments intended for the official
from Odebrecht S.A., the Brazilian construction conglomerate. Chatburn facilitated hiding these bribe payments by conducting the transactions
through several shell companies and bank accounts in multiple jurisdictions, including in the United States. Odebrecht S.A. pleaded guilty on
Dec. 21, 2016, in the Eastern District of New York to conspiring to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA in connection with a broader
scheme to pay nearly $800 million in bribes to public officials in twelve countries, including Angola, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Dominican
Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, Mozambique, Panama, Peru and Venezuela.

To date, 10 individuals, including former Ecuadorian government officials, oil services contractors and financial advisors, have pleaded guilty to
criminal charges in U.S. courts for their involvement in the PetroEcuador bribery and money laundering schemes.

This case was investigated by HSI and IRS-Cl, jointly under the auspices of the Global Illicit Financial Team, and by the FBIâs International
Corruption Squad in Miami. Deputy Chief Brian Young, Assistant Chiefs David Fuhr and Lorinda Laryea, Trial Attorney Katherine Raut of the
Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section, and Trial Attorneys Randall Warden and Mary Ann McCarthy of the Criminal Divisionâs Money Laundering and
Asset Recovery Section (MLARS) are prosecuting the case.

The U.S. Marshals Service and the Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs have provided significant assistance by obtaining evidence in
this case, as have public authorities in, among other countries, Ecuador, Panama and the Cayman Islands.

MLARSâs Bank Integrity Unit investigates and prosecutes banks and other financial institutions, including their officers, managers and
employees, whose actions threaten the integrity of the individual institution or the wider financial system.

The Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice Departmentâs FCPA

enforcement efforts can be found at www. justice. gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.

INDICTMENT
THE GRAND JURY CHARGES:

COUNT ONE
(Conspiracy â 18 U.S.C. Â§ 371)

Introduction
At all relevant times, unless otherwise specified:
1, The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (âFCPAâ), as amended,
Title 15, United States Code, Sections 78dd-1, et seq., was enacted by Congress for
the purpose of, among other things, making it unlawful to act corruptly in furtherance
of an offer, promise, authorization, or payment of money or anything of value,

directly or indirectly, to a foreign official for the purpose of obtaining or retaining
business for, or directing business to, any person.

2. Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (ââPDVSAâ) was the Venezuelan state-
owned and state-controlled oil company. PDVSA and its subsidiaries were
responsible for the exploration, production, refining, transportation, and trade in
energy resources in Venezuela and provided funding for other operations of the
Venezuelan government. PDVSA Services, Inc. (âPSIâ) was the U.S.-based affiliate
of PDVSA located in Houston, Texas, that, at various times, was responsible for
international purchasing on behalf of PDVSA. Bariven S.A. was the PDVSA
procurement subsidiary responsible for equipment purchases. PDVSA and its
wholly owned subsidiaries, including PSI and Bariven S.A. (hereinafter collectively
referred to as âPDVSAâ) were âinstrumentalitiesâ of the Venezuelan government as
that term is used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-
2(h)(2)(A). PDVSA officers and employees were âforeign officialsâ as that term is
used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Sections 78dd-2(h)(2)(A).

3. PDVSA awarded contracts for energy services and equipment in a
number of ways, including through a competitive bidding process. In some
instances, PDVSA also awarded sole source contracts.

4. âCompany A,â a company whose identity is known to the Grand Jury,
was a U.S.-based supplier of industrial equipment that was incorporated in the

United States. Company A was thus a âdomestic concernâ as that term is used in
the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2(h)(1). Company A and its
affiliates were PDVSAâs exclusive supplier of heavy equipment manufactured by
another company headquartered in the United States.

5. âCompany Aâs Affiliate,â a company whose identity is known to the
Grand Jury, was a Curacao-based company affiliated with Company A.

The Defendants and Their Co-Conspirators

6. Defendant RAFAEL ENRIQUE PINTO FRANCESCHI
(âPINTOâ) was a Venezuelan national and resident of the United States. PINTO
was employed as a sales representative for Company A. PINTO was thus a
âdomestic concernâ and an officer, director, employee, and agent of a âdomestic
concern,â and a stockholder thereof acting on behalf of a âdomestic concernâ as
those terms are used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-
2(h)(1).

7. Defendant FRANZ HERMAN MULLER HUBER (âMULLERâ)
was a Venezuelan national and resident of the United States. MULLER was the
President of Company A. MULLER was thus a âdomestic concernâ and an officer,
director, employee, and agent of a âdomestic concern,â and a stockholder thereof
acting on behalf of a âdomestic concernâ as those terms are used in the FCPA, Title

15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2(h)(1).
8. Jose Orlando Camacho (âCamachoâ), who has been charged separately,
was a dual Venezuelan and United States citizen who resided in the Southern District
of Texas. Between approximately 2004 and 2013, Camacho was employed by
PDVSA. During that time, Camacho held a number of positions related to
procurement, including serving as a sourcing supervisor and planning and
procurement manager for PSI.

9. Ivan Alexis Guedez (ââGuedezâ), who has been charged separately, was
a United States citizen who resided in the Southern District of Texas. Between
approximately 2006 and 2011, Guedez was employed by PSI. During that time,
Guedez held a number of positions related to procurement, including serving as the
purchasing manager for PSI.

10. âOfficial A,â an individual whose identity is known to the Grand Jury,
was a Venezuelan national and resident of the United States. Until approximately
2009 or 2010, Official A was employed by PSI as a buyer.

11. During their employment at PDVSA, Camacho, Guedez, and Official
A (together the âPDVSA officialsâ) were each a âforeign officialâ as that term is
used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2(h)(2)(A).

Other Entities
12. âShell Company A.â whose identity is known to the Grand Jury, was a

company organized under the laws of Panama.
13. The âSwiss Accountâ was a bank account in Switzerland in the name
of Shell Company A.

14. The âPanama Accountâ was a bank account in Panama held in the name
of one of PINTOâs associates.

15. The âPuerto Rico Accountâ was a bank account in Puerto Rico in the
name of a corporate entity whose identity is known to the Grand Jury.

The Conspiracy

16. Beginning in or around 2009 and continuing through at least 2013, in

the Southern District of Texas, and elsewhere, the defendants,

RAFAEL ENRIQUE PINTO FRANCESCHI and
FRANZ HERMAN MULLER HUBER

did willfully and knowingly conspire, confederate, and agree with others known and
unknown to the Grand Jury to commit offenses against the United States, that is, to
willfully make use of the mails and means and instrumentalities of interstate
commerce corruptly in furtherance of an offer, payment, promise to pay, and
authorization of the payment of any money, offer, gift, promise to give, and
authorization of the giving of anything of value to a foreign official and to a person,
while knowing that all and a portion of such money and thing of value would be and
had been offered, given, and promised to a foreign official, for purposes of: (i)
influencing acts and decisions of such foreign official in his official capacity; (ii)

inducing such foreign official to do and omit to do acts in violation of the lawful

5
duty of such official; (111) securing an improper advantage; and (iv) inducing such
foreign official to use his influence with a foreign government and agencies and
instrumentalities thereof to affect and influence acts and decisions of such
government and agencies and instrumentalities, in order to assist Company A,
PINTO, and MULLER in obtaining and retaining business for and with, and
directing business to, Company A and others, in violation of the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2(a).
Manner and Means of the Conspiracy

17. The manner and means by which PINTO, MULLER, and their co-
conspirators sought to accomplish the purpose of the conspiracy included, among
other things, the following, while in the Southern District of Texas and elsewhere:

18. PINTO and the PDVSA officials agreed that in exchange for bribe
payments, which they called âcommissions,â the PDVSA officials would assist
Company A in its business with PDVSA. PINTO, and later MULLER, would
receive kickbacks as part of the scheme. They agreed that they would take three
percent of each payment that PDVSA made to Company A and split it equally
amongst themselves.

19. PINTO and MULLER, together with others, paid bribes to the
PDVSA officials through the use of interstate and foreign wires in order to secure

an improper advantage, influence acts and decisions of the PDVSA officials in their
official capacities, and induce the PDVSA officials to do and omit to do certain acts,
including, but not limited to:
a. taking steps to ensure that end users at PDVSA would request a certain
brand of equipment for which Company A was a distributor, resulting
in additional business from PDVSA for Company A;

b. providing PINTO with inside information regarding PDVSA;

c. assisting Company A in receiving payment for previously awarded
PDVSA business, including by requesting payment priority for
Company A over other vendors.

20. Beginning in or around 2009 and continuing through at least 2013, the
conspirators agreed that three percent of every payment made by PDVSA to
Company A would be split as bribe payments and kickbacks as follows:

a. initially, as an even four-way split between bribes to Camacho, Guedez,

and Official A, and kickbacks to PINTO;

b. after Official Aâs employment at PDVSA was terminated in

approximately 2009 or 2010, as an even three-way split between
Camacho, Guedez, and PINTO; and
Cc. from in or around March 2012, MULLER received 0.5% while

Camacho, Guedez, and PINTO evenly split the remaining 2.5%.
21. MULLER, together with others, caused bribe payments to be wired
from Company Aâs Affiliateâs bank account in Curacao to the Swiss Account.
22. Guedez maintained a spreadsheet tracking the amounts paid into the
Swiss Account from Company Aâs Affiliate, and the amounts disbursed from the
Swiss Account to the foreign officials, PINTO, and MULLER.
23. PINTO and MULLER, together with others, attempted to conceal, and
did in fact conceal, the nature, source, and ownership of the bribes and kickbacks,
by:
a. Providing Guedez and Camacho with information regarding PDVSAâs
payments to Company A, which Guedez used to create false invoices in
the name of Shell Company A;

b. Causing invoices from Shell Company A to be paid, despite knowing that
Shell Company A had not provided any services to Company A or
Company Aâs Affiliate;

c. Communicating about the scheme using their personal email accounts,

35. Onor about December 2, 2012, PINTO sent an email to Camacho and
Guedez listing purchase orders for which Company A had been paid and noting the

the Swiss Account, notwithstanding that Shell Company A had not performed any
services for Company A or Company Aâs Affiliate. |

Introduction
At all relevant times, unless otherwise specified:
1. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (ââFCPAâ), as amended,
Title 15, United States Code, Sections 78dd-1, et seg., was enacted by Congress for
the purpose of, among other things, making it unlawful to act corruptly in furtherance

business for, or directing business to, any person.

2. Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (âPDVSAâ) was the Venezuelan state-
owned and state-controlled oil company. PDVSA and its subsidiaries were
responsible for the exploration, production, refining, transportation, and trade in
energy resources in Venezuela and provided funding for other operations of the
Venezuelan government. PDVSA Services, Inc. (âPSIâ) was the U.S.-based affiliate
of PDVSA located in Houston, Texas, that, at various times, was responsible for
international purchasing on behalf of PDVSA. Bariven S.A. was the PDVSA
procurement subsidiary responsible for equipment purchases. PDVSA and its
wholly owned subsidiaries, including PSI and Bariven S.A. (hereinafter collectively
referred to as âPDVSAâ) were âinstrumentalitiesâ of the Venezuelan government as
that term is used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-
2(h)(2)(A). PDVSA officers and employees were âforeign officialsâ as that term is
used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Sections 78dd-2(h)(2)(A).

3. | PDVSA awarded contracts for energy services and equipment in a
number of ways, including through a competitive bidding process. In some
instances, PDVSA also awarded sole source contracts.

4. âCompany A,â a company whose identity is known to the Grand Jury,
was a U.S.-based supplier of industrial equipment that was incorporated in the

United States. Company A was thus a âdomestic concernâ as that term is used in
the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2(h)(1). Company A and its
affiliates were PDVSAâs exclusive supplier of heavy equipment manufactured by
another company headquartered in the United States.

5. âCompany Aâs Affiliate,â a company whose identity is known to the
Grand Jury, was a Curacao-based company affiliated with Company A.

The Defendants and Their Co-Conspirators

6. Defendant RAFAEL ENRIQUE PINTO FRANCESCHI
(âPINTOâ) was a Venezuelan national and resident of the United States. PINTO
was employed as a sales representative for Company A. PINTO was thus a
âdomestic concernâ and an officer, director, employee, and agent of a âdomestic
concern,â and a stockholder thereof acting on behalf of a âdomestic concernâ as
those terms are used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-
2(h)(1).

7. Defendant FRANZ HERMAN MULLER HUBER (âMULLERâ)
was a Venezuelan national and resident of the United States. MULLER was the
President of Company A. MULLER was thus a âdomestic concernâ and an officer,
director, employee, and agent of a âdomestic concern,â and a stockholder thereof
acting on behalf of a âdomestic concernâ as those terms are used in the FCPA, Title

15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2(h)(1).
8. Jose Orlando Camacho (âCamachoâ), who has been charged separately,
was a dual Venezuelan and United States citizen who resided in the Southern District
of Texas. Between approximately 2004 and 2013, Camacho was employed by
PDVSA. During that time, Camacho held a number of positions related to
procurement, including serving as a sourcing supervisor and planning and
procurement manager for PSI.

9. Ivan Alexis Guedez (âGuedezâ), who has been charged separately, was
a United States citizen who resided in the Southern District of Texas. Between
approximately 2006 and 2011, Guedez was employed by PSI. During that time,
Guedez held a number of positions related to procurement, including serving as the
purchasing manager for PSI.

10. âOfficial A,â an individual whose identity is known to the Grand Jury,
was a Venezuelan national and resident of the United States. Until approximately
2009 or 2010, Official A was employed by PSI as a buyer.

11. During their employment at PDVSA, Camacho, Guedez, and Official
A (together the âPDVSA officialsâ) were each a âforeign officialâ as that term is
used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2(h)(2)(A).

13. The âSwiss Accountâ was a bank account in Switzerland in the name

of one of PINTOâs associates.

15. The âPuerto Rico Accountâ was a bank account in Puerto Rico in the

The Conspiracy

16. Beginning in or around 2009 and continuing through at least 2013, in

the Southern District of Texas, and elsewhere, the defendants,

RAFAEL ENRIQUE PINTO FRANCESCHI and
FRANZ HERMAN MULLER HUBER

did willfully and knowingly conspire, confederate, and agree with others known and
unknown to the Grand Jury to commit offenses against the United States, that is, to
willfully make use of the mails and means and instrumentalities of interstate
commerce corruptly in furtherance of an offer, payment, promise to pay, and
authorization of the payment of any money, offer, gift, promise to give, and
authorization of the giving of anything of value to a foreign official and to a person,
while knowing that all and a portion of such money and thing of value would be and
had been offered, given, and promised to a foreign official, for purposes of: (1)
influencing acts and decisions of such foreign official in his official capacity; (11)

inducing such foreign official to do and omit to do acts in violation of the lawful

5
duty of such official; (111) securing an improper advantage; and (iv) inducing such
foreign official to use his influence with a foreign government and agencies and
instrumentalities thereof to affect and influence acts and decisions of such
government and agencies and instrumentalities, in order to assist Company A,
PINTO, and MULLER in obtaining and retaining business for and with, and
directing business to, Company A and others, in violation of the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2(a).
Manner and Means of the Conspiracy

17. The manner and means by which PINTO, MULLER, and their co-
conspirators sought to accomplish the purpose of the conspiracy included, among
other things, the following, while in the Southern District of Texas and elsewhere:

18. PINTO and the PDVSA officials agreed that in exchange for bribe
payments, which they called âcommissions,â the PDVSA officials would assist
Company A in its business with PDVSA. PINTO, and later MULLER, would
receive kickbacks as part of the scheme. They agreed that they would take three
percent of each payment that PDVSA made to Company A and split it equally
amongst themselves.

19. PINTO and MULLER, together with others, paid bribes to the
PDVSA officials through the use of interstate and foreign wires in order to secure

an improper advantage, influence acts and decisions of the PDVSA officials in their

official capacities, and induce the PDVSA officials to do and omit to do certain acts,
including, but not limited to:
a. taking steps to ensure that end users at PDVSA would request a certain
brand of equipment for which Company A was a distributor, resulting
in additional business from PDVSA for Company A;

b. providing PINTO with inside information regarding PDVSA;

C. assisting Company A in receiving payment for previously awarded
PDVSA business, including by requesting payment priority for
Company A over other vendors.

20. Beginning in or around 2009 and continuing through at least 2013, the
conspirators agreed that three percent of every payment made by PDVSA to
Company A would be split as bribe payments and kickbacks as follows:

a. initially, as an even four-way split between bribes to Camacho, Guedez,

and Official A, and kickbacks to PINTO;

b. after Official Aâs employment at PDVSA was terminated in

approximately 2009 or 2010, as an even three-way split between
Camacho, Guedez, and PINTO; and
C. from in or around March 2012, MULLER received 0.5% while

Camacho, Guedez, and PINTO evenly split the remaining 2.5%.

28. On or about August 3, 2010, PINTO sent an email to Camacho and
Guedez, listing purchase orders for which Company A had been paid and noting the
three-percent calculation to be paid as part of the scheme. In the email, PINTO
distinguished between one invoice, for which âel pelonâ (a nickname for Official A)
should receive a portion of the commission payment, and two invoices for which âel
pelonâ was not to receive a portion.

29. Onor about February 16, 2011, PINTO sent an email to Camacho and
Guedez listing purchase orders for which Company A had been paid and noting the

30. On or about February 21, 2011, Guedez emailed MULLER a false
invoice in the amount of $167,601.99 in the name of Shell Company A. The invoice

the Swiss Account, notwithstanding that Shell Company A had not performed any
services for Company A or Company Aâs Affiliate.

31. On or about March 10, 2011, MULLER caused $167,601.99 to be
wired to the Swiss Account.

Guedez listing purchase orders for which Company A had been paid and noting the
three-percent calculation for this group of invoices as $159,542.98.

33. Onor about April 3, 2012, Guedez emailed MULLER a false invoice
in the amount of $159,542.98 in the name of Shell Company A. The invoice falsely

Company Aâs Affiliate and directed Company Aâs Affiliate to send payment to the

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Tuesday, February 26, 2019

Two Businessmen Charged with Foreign Bribery in Connection with Venezuela Bribery Scheme

A former sales representative and the president of a U.S.-based company were charged in an indictment unsealed today on foreign bribery, wire
fraud and money laundering charges for their alleged roles in a scheme to corruptly secure business advantages, including contracts and
payment on past due invoices, from Venezuelaâs state-owned and state-controlled energy company, Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA).

Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Ryan K. Patrick of the Southern
District of Texas and Special Agent in Charge Mark Dawson of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcementâs Homeland Security Investigations
(HSI) Houston Field Office made the announcement.

Rafael Enrique Pinto Franceschi (Pinto), 40, of Miami, Florida, and Franz Herman Muller Huber (Muller), 68, of Weston, Florida, were charged ina
five-count indictment returned in the Southern District of Texas on Feb. 21, and unsealed today. Pinto and Muller made their initial
appearances today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Jonathan Goodman of the Southern District of Florida. Pinto and Muller are each charged with
one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, two counts of wire
fraud, and one count of conspiracy to launder money.

The indictment alleges that beginning in or around 2009 and continuing through at least 2013, Pinto, a sales representative for a Miami-based
PDVSA supplier (âCompany Aâ in the indictment), and Muller, the President of Company A, conspired with others to bribe three PDVSA officials
in exchange for providing assistance in connection with Company Aâs PDVSA business. According to the indictment, in exchange for bribe
payments the PDVSA officials allegedly assisted Company A in obtaining additional PDVSA contracts, inside information and payment on past
due invoices. The indictment alleges that when Company A received a payment from PDVSA, Pinto would alert one of the PDVSA officials who
would, in turn, create a fictitious invoice from a Panamanian shell company charging Company A three percent of whatever payment Company
A had received from PDVSA and directing Company A to send payment to a Swiss bank account. According to the charges, the false invoice
would be sent to Muller, who would ensure that the invoices were paid.

The wire fraud charges against Pinto and Muller are based on allegations that, in addition to directing Company A money to the three PDVSA
officials to benefit Company A, Pinto and Muller received kickbacks in connection with the scheme. In total, Pinto is alleged to have received
over $985,000 in kickback payments, and Muller over $258,000.

Two of the three officials that Pinto and Muller are accused of bribing - Jose Camacho and Ivan Guedez, both of Houston - have already pleaded
guilty in connection with the case and are pending sentencing.

An indictment is merely an allegation and the defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of
law.

With the unsealing of the indictment today, the Justice Department has announced charges against 21 individuals, 15 of whom have pleaded
guilty, as part of a larger, ongoing investigation by the U.S. government into bribery at PDVSA. HSI Houston is conducting the ongoing
investigation with assistance from HSI Boston and Miami. Trial Attorneys Sarah E. Edwards and Sonali D. Patel of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud
Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys John P. Pearson and Robert S. Johnson of the Southern District of Texas are prosecuting the case. Assistant
U.S. Attorney Kristine Rollison of the Southern District of Texas is handling the forfeiture aspects of the case.

The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs, the Swiss Federal Office of Justice, and the Cayman Mutual Legal Assistance Authority and
Cayman Office of the Director of Public Prosecution also provided assistance.

The Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Departmentâs FCPA

enforcement efforts can be found at www. justice. gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.

Re: Fresenius Medical Care AG & Co. KGaA.
Dear Mr. Carr-Howard:

The United States Department of Justice, Criminal Division, Fraud Section and the United
States Attorneyâs Office for the District of Massachusetts (collectively, the âDepartmentâ) and
Fresenius Medical Care AG & Co. KGaA (the âCompanyâ) pursuant to authority granted by the
Companyâs Management Board, enter into this Non-Prosecution Agreement (the âAgreementâ).
On the understandings specified below, the Department will not criminally prosecute the Company
for any crimes (except for criminal tax violations, as to which the Department does not make any
agreement) relating to any of the conduct described in the Statement of Facts attached hereto as
Attachment A. To the extent there is conduct disclosed by the Company that does not relate to
any of the conduct described in the attached Statement of Facts, such conduct will not be exempt
from prosecution and is not within the scope of or relevant to this Agreement. The Company,
pursuant to authority granted by the Companyâs Management Board, also agrees to certain terms
and obligations of the Agreement as described below.

The Department enters into this Agreement based on the individual facts and circumstances
presented by this case and the Company, including:

(a) the Company did receive voluntary disclosure credit because it voluntarily and
timely disclosed to the Department the conduct described in the Statement of Facts attached hereto
as Attachment A (âStatement of Factsâ);

(b) the Company received partial credit for its cooperation with the Departmentâs
investigation, including: conducting a thorough internal investigation; making regular factual
presentations to the Department; providing facts learned during witness interviews; voluntarily
making foreign-based employees available for interviews in the United States; producing
documents to the Department from foreign countries in ways that did not implicate foreign data
privacy laws; collecting, analyzing, and organizing voluminous evidence and information from
multiple jurisdictions for the Department, including translating key documents; and disclosing
conduct to the Department that was outside the scope of its initial voluntary self-disclosure;
however, the Company did not receive full cooperation credit because it did not timely respond to

1
requests by the Department and, at times, did not provide fulsome responses to requests for
information;

(c) the Company provided to the Department all relevant facts known to it, including
information about the individuals involved in the conduct described in the attached Statement of
Facts and conduct disclosed to the Department prior to the Agreement;

(d) the Company engaged in remedial measures, including: (1) causing at least ten
employees who were involved in or failed to detect the misconduct described in the Statement of
Facts to be removed from the Company, because their employment was terminated, they resigned
after being asked to leave, or they voluntarily left once the Companyâs internal investigation began;
(2) enhancing its compliance program, controls, and anti-corruption training; (3) terminating
business relationships with the third party agents and distributors who participated in the
misconduct described in the Statement of Facts; (4) adopting heightened controls on the selection
and use of third parties, to include third party due diligence; and (5) withdrawing from
consideration of pending public contracts potentially related to the misconduct described in the
Statement of Facts;

(e) the Company has enhanced, and has committed to continuing to enhance, its
compliance program and internal controls, including by taking steps to ensure that its compliance
program satisfies the minimum elements set forth in Attachment B to this Agreement (Corporate
Compliance Program);

(f) misconduct continued to occur at the Company until 2016, thus the parties have
agreed that to ensure and test the effectiveness of the Companyâs enhanced compliance program
and to prevent a reoccurrence of the conduct outlined in the Statement of Facts, an independent
compliance monitor shall be appointed for a term of two years;

(g) the nature and seriousness of the offense conduct, including: the amount of illegal
payments to foreign officials; conduct in multiple, high-risk jurisdictions; the pervasiveness
throughout a business unit of the Company responsible for the conduct described in the Statement
of Facts; the continuation of unlawful conduct until 2016; and the involvement of certain high-
level executives;

(h) the Company has agreed to disgorge $147 million in profits and prejudgment
interest to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the âSECââ) in connection with the conduct
described in the Statement of Facts;

(1) the Company has agreed to continue to cooperate with the Department in any
ongoing investigation of the conduct of the Company; and

(j) accordingly, after considering (a) through (1) above, the Department believes that
the appropriate resolution of this case is a non-prosecution agreement with the Company, a
criminal penalty with an aggregate discount of 40% off of the bottom of the U.S. Sentencing
Guidelines fine range, and an independent compliance monitor for a term of two years, followed
by self-monitoring for the remainder of the Agreement.
The Company admits, accepts, and acknowledges that it is responsible under United States
law for the acts of its officers, directors, employees, and agents as set forth in the attached
Statement of Facts, and that the facts described therein are true and accurate and constitute a willful
violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (âFCPAâ), 15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78dd-1, et seg. The
Company expressly agrees that it shall not, through present or future attorneys, officers, directors,
employees, agents or any other person authorized to speak for the Company make any public
statement, in litigation or otherwise, contradicting the acceptance of responsibility under U.S. law
by the Company set forth above or the facts described in the attached Statement of Facts. The
Company agrees that if it or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries or affiliates issues a press
release or holds any press conference in connection with this Agreement, the Company shall first
consult the Department to determine (a) whether the text of the release or proposed statements at
the press conference are true and accurate with respect to matters between the Department and the
Company; and (b) whether the Department has any objection to the release.

The Companyâs obligations under this Agreement shall have a term of three years from the
later of the date on which the Agreement is executed or the date on which the independent
compliance monitor (the âMonitorââ) is retained by the Company, as described below (the âTermââ).
The Company agrees, however, that, in the event the Department determines, in its sole discretion,
that the Company has knowingly violated any provision of this Agreement or has failed to
completely perform or fulfill each of the Companyâs obligations under this Agreement, an
extension or extensions of the Term may be imposed by the Department, in its sole discretion, for
up to a total additional time period of one year, without prejudice to the Departmentâs right to
proceed as provided in the breach provisions of this Agreement below. Any extension of the
Agreement extends all terms of this Agreement, including the terms of the monitorship in
Attachment C, for an equivalent period. Conversely, in the event the Department finds, in its sole
discretion, that there exists a change in circumstances sufficient to eliminate the need for the
monitorship in Attachment C, and that the other provisions of this Agreement have been satisfied,
the Agreement may be terminated early.

The Company shall cooperate fully with the Department in any and all matters relating to
the conduct described in this Agreement and the attached Statement of Facts and other conduct
under investigation by the Department at any time during the Term, subject to applicable law and
regulations, until the later of the date upon which all investigations and prosecutions arising out of
such conduct are concluded, or the end of the Term. At the request of the Department, the
Company shall also cooperate fully with other domestic or foreign law enforcement and regulatory
authorities and agencies, as well as with Multilateral Development Banks (âMDBsââ), in any
investigation of the Company, its parent company or its affiliates, or any of its present or former
officers, directors, employees, agents, and consultants, or any other party, in any and all matters
relating to the conduct described in this Agreement and the attached Statement of Facts and other
conduct under investigation by the Department or any other component of the Department of
Justice at any time during the Term. The Companyâs cooperation pursuant to this Paragraph is
subject to applicable law and regulations, including relevant data privacy, national security laws
and regulations, and labor laws, as well as valid claims of attorney-client privilege or attorney
work product doctrine; however, the Company must provide to the Department a log of any
information or cooperation that is not provided based on an assertion of law, regulation, or
privilege, and the Company bears the burden of establishing the validity of any such assertion.
The Company agrees that its cooperation shall include, but not be limited to, the following:

a. The Company shall truthfully disclose all factual information with respect to its
activities, those of its parent company and affiliates, and those of its present and former directors,
officers, employees, agents, and consultants, including any evidence or allegations and internal or
external investigations, about which the Company has any knowledge or about which the
Department may inquire. This obligation of truthful disclosure includes, but is not limited to, the
obligation of the Company to provide to the Department, upon request, any document, record or
other tangible evidence about which the Department may inquire of the Company.

b. Upon request of the Department, the Company shall designate knowledgeable
employees, agents or attorneys to provide to the Department the information and materials
described above on behalf of the Company. It is further understood that the Company must at all
times provide complete, truthful, and accurate information.

C. The Company shall use its best efforts to make available for interviews or
testimony, as requested by the Department, present or former officers, directors, employees,
agents, and consultants of the Company. This obligation includes, but is not limited to, sworn
testimony before a federal grand jury or in federal trials, as well as interviews with domestic or
foreign law enforcement and regulatory authorities. Cooperation shall include identification of
witnesses who, to the knowledge of the Company, may have material information regarding the
matters under investigation.

d. With respect to any information, testimony, documents, records or other tangible
evidence provided to the Department pursuant to this Agreement, the Company consents to any
and all disclosures to other governmental authorities, including United States authorities and those
of a foreign government, of such materials as the Department, in its sole discretion, shall deem
appropriate.

In addition, during the Term, should the Company learn of any evidence or allegation that
may constitute a violation of the FCPA anti-bribery or accounting provisions had the conduct
occurred within the jurisdiction of the United States, or any evidence or allegation of a violation
of a Federal health care fraud offense, as that term is defined in Title 18, United States Code,
Section 24, the Company shall promptly report such evidence or allegation to the Department. On
the date that the Term expires, the Company, by the Chief Executive Officer of the Company and
the Chief Financial Officer of the Company, will certify to the Department that the Company has
met its disclosure obligations pursuant to this Agreement. Each certification will be deemed a
material statement and representation by the Company to the executive branch of the United States
for purposes of 18 U.S.C. Â§ 1001.

The Company represents that it has implemented and will continue to implement a
compliance and ethics program designed to prevent and detect violations of the FCPA and other
applicable anti-corruption laws throughout its operations, including those of its affiliates, agents,
and joint ventures, and those of its contractors and subcontractors whose responsibilities include
interacting with foreign officials or other activities carrying a high risk of corruption, including,
but not limited to, the minimum elements set forth in Attachment B (Corporate Compliance
Program).

In order to address any deficiencies in its internal accounting controls, policies, and
procedures, the Company represents that it has undertaken, and will continue to undertake in the
future, in a manner consistent with all of its obligations under this Agreement, a review of its
existing internal accounting controls, policies, and procedures regarding compliance with the
FCPA and other applicable anti-corruption laws as set forth within the scope of the Mandate and
Corporate Compliance Program (Attachments B and C). Where necessary and appropriate, the
Company agrees to adopt a new compliance program, or to modify its existing one, including
internal controls, compliance policies, and procedures in order to ensure that it maintains: (a) an
effective system of internal accounting controls designed to ensure the making and keeping of fair
and accurate books, records, and accounts; and (b) a rigorous anti-corruption compliance program
that incorporates relevant internal accounting controls, as well as policies and procedures designed
to effectively detect and deter violations of the FCPA and other applicable anti-corruption laws.
The compliance program, including the internal accounting controls system will include, but not
be limited to, the minimum elements set forth in Attachment B. In assessing the companyâs
compliance program, the Department, in its sole discretion, may consider the Monitorâs
certification decision.

The Company agrees to retain a Monitor for the term of two years from the date on which
the Monitor is retained by the Company, subject to extension or early termination as described
above. The Monitorâs duties and authority, and the obligations of the Company with respect to
the Monitor and the Department, are set forth in Attachment C, which is incorporated by reference
into this Agreement. No later than the date of execution of this Agreement, the Company will
propose to the Department a pool of three qualified candidates to serve as the Monitor. The
Monitor candidates or their team members shall have, at a minimum, the following qualifications:

a. demonstrated expertise with respect to the FCPA and other applicable anti-
corruption laws, including experience counseling on FCPA issues;

b. experience designing and/or reviewing corporate compliance policies,
procedures and internal controls, including FCPA and anti-corruption
policies, procedures and internal controls;

C. the ability to access and deploy resources as necessary to discharge the
Monitorâs duties as described in the Agreement; and

d. sufficient independence from the Company to ensure effective and impartial
performance of the Monitorâs duties as described in the Agreement.

The Department retains the right, in its sole discretion, to choose the Monitor from among
the candidates proposed by the Company, though the Company may express its preference(s)
among the candidates. Monitor selections shall be made in keeping with the Department of
Justiceâs commitment to diversity and inclusion. If the Department determines, in its sole
discretion, that any of the candidates are not, in fact, qualified to serve as the Monitor, or if the
Department, in its sole discretion, is not satisfied with the candidates proposed, the Department
reserves the right to request that the Company nominate additional candidates. In the event the
Department rejects any proposed Monitors, the Company shall propose additional candidates
within twenty business days after receiving notice of the rejection so that three qualified candidates
are proposed. This process shall continue until a Monitor acceptable to both parties is chosen. The
Department and the Company will use their best efforts to complete the selection process within
sixty calendar days of the execution of this Agreement. If the Monitor resigns or is otherwise
unable to fulfill his or her obligations as set out herein and in Attachment C, the Company shall
within twenty business days recommend a pool of three qualified Monitor candidates from which
the Department will choose a replacement.

The Monitorâs powers, duties, and responsibilities, as well as additional circumstances that
may support an extension of the Monitorâs term, are set forth in Attachment C. The Company
agrees that it will not employ or be affiliated with the Monitor or the Monitorâs firm for a period
of not less than two years from the date on which the Monitorâs term expires. Nor will the
Company discuss with the Monitor or the Monitorâs firm the possibility of further employment or
affiliation during the Monitorâs term.

At the end of the monitorship, provided all requirements set forth in Paragraphs 19-20 of
Attachment C are met, the Company will report on its compliance to the Department periodically,
every six-months, for the remainder of this Agreement, regarding remediation and implementation
of the enhanced compliance measures set forth by the Monitor as described in Paragraph 21 of
Attachment C.

The Company agrees to pay a monetary penalty in the amount of $84,715,273 to the United
States Treasury no later than five business days after the Agreement is fully executed, and to pay
disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $147 million. The monetary penalty is
based upon profits of approximately $141,192,121 as a result of the offense conduct, and reflects
a discount of 40% off of the bottom of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines fine range. The Department
will credit the $147 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest that the Company is paying
to the SEC. The Company acknowledges that no tax deduction may be sought in connection with
the payment of any part of this $84,715,273 penalty. The Company shall not seek or accept directly
or indirectly re1mbursement or indemnification from any source with regard to the penalty or
disgorgement amounts that the Company pays pursuant to this Agreement or any other agreement
entered into with an enforcement authority or regulator concerning the facts set forth in the
attached Statement of Facts.

The Department agrees, except as provided herein, that it will not bring any criminal or
civil case (except for criminal tax violations, as to which the Department does not make any
agreement) against the Company relating to any of the conduct described in the attached Statement
of Facts. The Department, however, may use any information related to the conduct described in
the attached Statement of Facts against the Company: (a) in a prosecution for perjury or obstruction
of justice; (b) in a prosecution for making a false statement; (c) in a prosecution or other proceeding
relating to any crime of violence; or (d) in a prosecution or other proceeding relating to a violation
of any provision of Title 26 of the United States Code. This Agreement does not provide any
protection against prosecution for any future conduct by the Company or any of its present or
former parents or subsidiaries. In addition, this Agreement does not provide any protection against
prosecution of any individuals, regardless of their affiliation with the Company or any of its present
or former parents or subsidiaries.

If, during the Term, the Company (a) commits any felony under U.S. federal law; (b)
provides in connection with this Agreement deliberately false, incomplete, or misleading
information, including in connection with its disclosure of information about individual
culpability; (c) fails to cooperate as set forth in this Agreement; (d) fails to implement a compliance
program as set forth in this Agreement and Attachment B; (e) commits any acts that, had they
occurred within the jurisdictional reach of the FCPA, would be a violation of the FCPA; or (f)
otherwise fails to completely perform or fulfill each of the Companyâs obligations under the
Agreement, regardless of whether the Department becomes aware of such a breach after the Term
is complete, the Company shall thereafter be subject to prosecution for any federal criminal
violation of which the Department has knowledge, including, but not limited to, the conduct
described in the attached Statement of Facts, which may be pursued by the Department in the U.S.
District Court for the District of Massachusetts or any other appropriate venue. Determination of
whether the Company has breached the Agreement and whether to pursue prosecution of the
Company shall be in the Departmentâs sole discretion. Any such prosecution may be premised on
information provided by the Company or its personnel. Any such prosecution relating to the
conduct described in the attached Statement of Facts or relating to conduct known to the
Department prior to the date on which this Agreement was signed that is not time-barred by the
applicable statute of limitations on the date of the signing of this Agreement may be commenced
against the Company, notwithstanding the expiration of the statute of limitations, between the
signing of this Agreement and the expiration of the Term plus one year. Thus, by signing this
Agreement, the Company agrees that the statute of limitations with respect to any such prosecution
that is not time-barred on the date of the signing of this Agreement shall be tolled for the Term
plus one year. In addition, the Company agrees that the statute of limitations as to any violation
of U.S. federal law that occurs during the Term will be tolled from the date upon which the
violation occurs until the earlier of the date upon which the Department is made aware of the
violation or the duration of the Term plus five years, and that this period shall be excluded from
any calculation of time for purposes of the application of the statute of limitations.

In the event the Department determines that the Company has breached this Agreement,
the Department agrees to provide the Company with written notice of such breach prior to
instituting any prosecution resulting from such breach. Within thirty days of receipt of such notice,
the Company shall have the opportunity to respond to the Department in writing to explain the
nature and circumstances of such breach, as well as the actions the Company has taken to address
and remediate the situation, which explanation the Department shall consider in determining
whether to pursue prosecution of the Company.

In the event that the Department determines that the Company has breached this
Agreement: (a) all statements made by or on behalf of the Company to the Department or to the
Court, including the attached Statement of Facts and any testimony given by the Company before
a grand jury, a court, or any tribunal, or at any legislative hearings, whether prior or subsequent to
this Agreement, and any leads derived from such statements or testimony, shall be admissible in
evidence in any and all criminal proceedings brought by the Department against the Company;
and (b) the Company shall not assert any claim under the United States Constitution, Rule 11(f) of
the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rule 410 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, or any other
federal rule that any such statements or testimony made by or on behalf of the Company prior or
subsequent to this Agreement, or any leads derived therefrom, should be suppressed or are
otherwise inadmissible. The decision whether conduct or statements of any current director,
officer or employee, or any person acting on behalf of, or at the direction of, the Company, will be
imputed to the Company for the purpose of determining whether the Company has violated any
provision of this Agreement shall be in the sole discretion of the Department.

Except as may otherwise be agreed by the parties in connection with a particular
transaction, the Company agrees that in the event that, during the Term, it undertakes any change
in corporate form, including if it sells, merges, or transfers business operations that are material to
the Companyâs consolidated operations, or to the operations of any subsidiaries or affiliates
involved in the conduct described in the attached Statement of Facts, as they exist as of the date of
this Agreement, whether such change is structured as a sale, asset sale, merger, transfer, or other
change in corporate form, it shall include in any contract for sale, merger, transfer, or other change
in corporate form a provision binding the purchaser, or any successor in interest thereto, to the
obligations described in this Agreement. The purchaser or successor in interest must also agree in
writing that the Departmentâs ability to determine there has been a breach under this Agreement is
applicable in full force to that entity. The Company agrees that the failure to include this
Agreementâs breach provisions in the transaction will make any such transaction null and void.
The Company shall provide notice to the Department at least thirty (30) days prior to undertaking
any such sale, merger, transfer, or other change in corporate form. The Department shall notify
the Company prior to such transaction (or series of transactions) if it determines that the
transaction(s) will have the effect of circumventing or frustrating the enforcement purposes of this
Agreement. If at any time during the Term the Company engages in a transaction(s) that has the
effect of circumventing or frustrating the enforcement purposes of this Agreement, the Department
may deem it a breach of this Agreement pursuant to the breach provisions of this Agreement.
Nothing herein shall restrict the Company from indemnifying (or otherwise holding harmless) the
purchaser or successor in interest for penalties or other costs arising from any conduct that may
have occurred prior to the date of the transaction, so long as such indemnification does not have
the effect of circumventing or frustrating the enforcement purposes of this Agreement, as
determined by the Department.

This Agreement is binding on the Company and the Department but specifically does not
bind any other component of the Department of Justice, other federal agencies, or any state, local
or foreign law enforcement or regulatory agencies, or any other authorities, although the
Department will bring the cooperation of the Company and its compliance with its other
obligations under this Agreement to the attention of such agencies and authorities if requested to
do so by the Company.

It is further understood that the Company and the Department may disclose this Agreement
to the public.
This Agreement sets forth all the terms of the agreement between the Company and the
Department. No amendments, modifications or additions to this Agreement shall be valid unless
they are in writing and signed by the Department, the attorneys for the Company, and a duly
authorized representative of the Company. |

STATEMENT OF FACTS

The following Statement of Facts is incorporated by reference as part of the non-
prosecution agreement (the âAgreementâ) between the United States Department of Justice,
Criminal Division, Fraud Section and the United States Attorneyâs Office for the District of
Massachusetts (collectively, the âDepartmentâ) and Fresenius Medical Care AG & Co. KGaA
(âFMCâ or the âCompanyâ). FMC hereby agrees and stipulates that the following information is
true and accurate. FMC admits, accepts, and acknowledges that it is responsible for the acts of its
officers, directors, employees, and agents as set forth below:

Relevant Entities and Individuals

1. FMC, a German Corporation headquartered in Bad Homburg, Germany, was a
leading provider of products and services for people with chronic kidney failure. FMC engaged
in its business through various subsidiaries around the world, and FMC maintained separate
geographic divisions which oversaw operations of its subsidiaries in the carrying out of FMCâs
business. FMCâs American Depositary Receipt shares were publicly traded on the New York
Stock Exchange under the ticker âFMSâ and it was an âissuerâ within the meaning of the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act (ââFCPAâ), Title 15, United States Code, Sections 78 dd-1(a) and 78m(b).

2. FMCâs Europe, Middle East, and Africa (âEMEAâ) division includes Fresenius
Medical Care Deutschland GmbH (âFMC-Dââ), a limited liability company organized under the
federal laws of Germany. The EMEA division was responsible for FMCâs operations of its

subsidiaries in those areas and its leadership and staff were based in Bad Homburg, Germany.

A-1
3. âFMC Executive 1,â an individual whose identity is known to the Department and
to FMC, was a high-level executive within the EMEA division whose responsibilities included
business development.

4. âFMC Employee 1,â an individual whose identity is known to the Department and
to FMC, was a sales manager within the EMEA division whose responsibilities included sales in
North and West Africa.

Overview of the Schemes

5. Between in or around 2007 and in or around 2016, FMC, through its agents and
employees, engaged in various schemes to pay bribes to publicly-employed health and/or
government officials to obtain or retain business for and on behalf of FMC. In Angola and Saudi
Arabia, these agents and employees utilized the means and instrumentalities of U.S. interstate
commerce, including the use of internet-based email accounts hosted by numerous service
providers located in the United States. With respect to these schemes, as well as in connection
with conduct in Morocco, Spain, Turkey, and West Africa, FMC, through its agents and
employees, knowingly and willfully failed to implement reasonable internal accounting controls
over financial transactions or failed to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly
reflected the transactions.

FCPA Anti-Bribery Violations

Angola
Relevant Entities and Individuals

6. FMC Portugal was a wholly owned subsidiary of FMC under the responsibility of
FMCâs EMEA Division. FMC operated in Portugal and Angola, through FMC Portugal. FMC

Portugal provided FMC services and products in Portugal and sold FMC products for use in

A-2
Angola. FMC Portugal and its employees were âagentsâ of an issuer within the meaning of the
FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-1(a).

7. âFMC Portugal Executive 1,â an individual whose identity is known to the
Department and to FMC, was a high-level executive at FMC Portugal whose responsibilities
included business development.

8. FMC and FMC Portugal operated in Angola through FMC Angola, which was
established for the purpose of expanding FMC into the Angolan dialysis market. FMC Angola
was overseen by FMC Portugal. FMC Angola and its employees were âagentsâ of an issuer within
the meaning of the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-1(a).

9. âAngolan State-Owned Clinic 1,â an entity whose identity is known to the
Department and to FMC, was a state-owned and controlled medical clinic in Angola that
performed functions that Angola treated as its own, and thus was an instrumentality within the
meaning of the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-1((1).

10. âAngolan State-Owned Clinic 2,â an entity whose identity is known to the
Department and to FMC, was a state-owned and controlled medical clinic in Angola that
performed functions that Angola treated as its own, and thus was an instrumentality within the
meaning of the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-1((1).

11. âAngolan State-Owned Military Hospital,â an entity whose identity is known to the
Department and to FMC, was a state-owned and controlled hospital in Angola that performed
functions that Angola treated as its own, and thus was an instrumentality within the meaning of
the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-1(f)(1).

12. âAngolan Military Health Officer,â an individual whose identity is known to the

Department and to FMC, was a high-ranking officer in the Medical Services Division of the

A-3
Angolan Armed Forces and a âforeign officialâ within the meaning of the FCPA, Title 15, United
States Code, Section 78dd-1(f)(1).

13. âShareholder Company,â an entity whose identity is known to the Department and
to FMC, was owned by the sons of the Angolan Military Health Officer. One of the owners of
Shareholder Company was also a shareholder in FMC Angola.

14. âAngolan Doctor 1,â an individual whose identity is known to the Department and
to FMC, was a top nephrologist in Angola, a Director at the Angolan State-Owned Military
Hospital, an employee of Angolan State-Owned Clinic 2, and a âforeign officialâ within the
meaning of the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-1((1).

15. âAngolan Doctor 2,â an individual whose identity is known to the Department and
to FMC, was a top nephrologist in Angola, an employee of Angolan State-Owned Clinic 1 and
Angolan State-Owned Clinic 2, and a âforeign officialâ within the meaning of the FCPA, Title 15,
United States Code, Section 78dd-1(f)(1).

Conduct Relevant to Angola

16. Between approximately 2010 and 2014, FMC, through FMC Portugal and FMC
Angola, offered or provided things of value to the Angolan Military Health Officer and his family,
as well as prominent Angolan government-employed nephrologists, specifically shares in a joint
venture, storage contracts, and consultancy agreements, for the purpose of securing an improper
advantage and assisting FMC with obtaining and retaining business in Angola.

17. For example, in developing the FMC Angola joint venture, on or about August 4,
2010, FMC Portugal Executive | emailed FMC Executive | explaining the intention to attribute
35% of the share capital of FMC Angola to certain âlocal partnersâ as minority shareholders â

specifically â15% to [Angolan Military Health Officer who was listed by his military rank], 15%

A-4
to [Angolan Doctor 1] and 5% to NefroAngola - a local company which owners are all the Angolan
nephrologists.â

18. On or about August 24, 2010, FMC Portugal Executive 1 emailed another FMC
Portugal executive requesting that she update the drafts of the proposal to sell shares of FMC
Angola for FMC Executive 1 and another FMC executive to consider. This new configuration
assigned 15% of the share capital of FMC Angola to the Angolan Military Health Officer, who
was identified as âDr.â instead of by his military rank as in previous emails; 12.5% of the share
capital to Angolan Doctor 1; 2.5% of the share capital to Angolan Doctor 2; and 5% of the share
capital to NefroAngola. This email also explained that the payment for share acquisition on the
part of the new minority shareholders would be made when the first dividends were distributed.

19. In or around September 2010, FMC Executive | prepared and presented the
proposal to sell shares in FMC Angola to âlocal partnersâ to the FMC Board of Management
(âBoMâ) in Germany. The JVA did not disclose that the minority shareholders included an
Angolan military health officer and Angolan government-employed doctors. Rather the JVA
simply identified the Angolan Military Health Officer as a âDoctor.â Ultimately, no shares were
provided to the Angolan Military Health Officer.

20. During the same time period, in or around September 2010, FMC Angola started
selling products to Angolan State-Owned Clinic 1, where Angolan Doctor 2 (a proposed
shareholder) was employed, and Angolan State-Owned Military Hospital, where Angolan Doctor
1 (another proposed shareholder) was employed. Further, FMC entered into a contract for services
with Angolan State-Owned Clinic 2, where both Angolan Doctor | and Angolan Doctor 2 were

also employed.

A-5
21. Approximately one month later, in or around October 2010, the FMC BoM
approved the JVA and valued the minority shareholdersâ stake at $35,000. The JVA was structured
so that the shares would be purchased with proceeds from the first dividends issued by FMC
Angola. On or about October 27, 2011, FMC Portugal Executive 1 emailed a spreadsheet with the
total number of shares that each shareholder would receive to the Angolan Military Health Officer
and copied Angolan Doctor | on his internet-based email account. The JVA was not finalized
until January 2012, when shares of FMC Angola were formally transferred to the minority
shareholders, including the foreign officials identified above.

22. In or around January 2012, the shareholder agreement between FMC, the son of the
Angolan Military Health Officer (who was appointed in place of the Angolan Military Health
Officer), Angolan Doctor 1, Angolan Doctor 2, and NefroAngola was finalized. The minority
shareholders never paid for their shares in FMC Angola, nor did they ever receive dividends

23. In exchange for their shares, the minority shareholders directed customers to FMC
Angola. For example, in or around June 2012, FMC executives and FMC Portugal executives
received an internal audit report highlighting a conflict of interest that existed in FMC Angola,
specifically âtwo Angolan shareholders brought customers to FMC Angolaâ and that these
shareholders âalso work for these customers as doctors.ââ As discussed above, Angolan Doctors 1
and 2 were both shareholders in FMC Angola and both employed by Angolan state-owned entities.
Further, the Angolan Military Health Officer, whose son was a designated shareholder of FMC
Angola, exercised authority over the Angolan State-Owned Military Hospital in his role as an
officer in the Medical Services Division of the Angolan Armed Forces. Thus, FMC was made

aware that the minority shareholders were foreign officials.

A-6
24. In or around late 2010, FMC Angola entered into an oral contract with the
Shareholder Company, which was owned by the sons of the Angolan Military Health Officer, to
provide warehousing space. In or around December 2011, FMC Angola paid approximately
$560,000 to the Shareholder Company for purported âTemporary Storage Services,â however, no
FMC Angola products were ever stored at the Shareholder Company warehouse.

25. After the June 2012 internal audit report identified this temporary storage contract
as a conflict of interest, in or around July 2012, FMC Angola (through a FMC Portugal executive
and FMC Portugal Executive 1) executed a written contract with the Shareholder Company to
provide temporary storage services for approximately $77,000 per month from January 2012 to
January 2013. During that time period, no FMC Angola products were ever stored at the
Shareholder Company warehouse. FMC Angola did not ultimately pay the storage fees associated
with the written contract due to the initiation of the Companyâs internal investigation.

26. In addition to the temporary storage contract with the Shareholder Company, FMC
Angola entered into a separate distribution arrangement with the Shareholder Company in which
the Shareholder Company would serve as the sole distributor for FMC products sold to Angolan
State-Owned Clinic 1. In or around July 2012, FMC Portugal Executive | emailed the Shareholder
Company, wherein he stated that â[FMC Angola] might be able to move the contracts from
[Angolan State-Owned Clinic 1] into [Shareholder Company] before the end of the year!!â In or
around 2013, Angolan State-Owned Clinic 1 notified FMC Angola that it was no longer on the list
of authorized suppliers for certain consumable products and that Angolan State-Owned Clinic 1
could only purchase these products through the Shareholder Company because Shareholder
Company was on the list of authorized dealers. Thereafter, FMC Angola sold the designated

products to the Shareholder Company without a written contract, while FMC Angola continued to

A-7
supply other products directly to Angolan State-Owned Clinic 1. The Shareholder Company never
paid FMC Angola for the products purportedly purchased for distribution to Angolan State-Owned
Clinic 1. FMC terminated the distribution to Shareholder Company in or around 2014.

27. Finally, FMC Portugal and FMC Angola also made improper payments to
government doctors through sham consulting contracts for which no services were ever performed.
For example, beginning in or around January 2011, FMC Portugal entered into a contract with
Angolan Doctor | for purported consulting services for â¬5,000 per month. On or about May 24,
2011, FMC Portugal Executive | emailed Angolan Doctor | on his internet-based email account
discussing his consultancy payments for January 2011 until April 2011. In or around October
2011, after the initial consulting contract was terminated, FMC Angola entered into a second
consulting contract with Angolan Doctor 1. The second contract was for purported consulting
services to provide information about the Angolan dialysis market for $7,500 per month. The
second contract was terminated in or around November 2012. Angolan Doctor 1, however, never
provided any services related to these consulting agreements.

28. In addition, beginning in or around April 2010, NefroCare Portugal (a subsidiary
of FMC Portugal) entered into a contract with Angolan Doctor 2 to provide purported consultancy
services related to the Angolan health industry for which Angolan Doctor 2 was paid
approximately â¬2,500 per month, which increased to â¬3,500 per month in or around January 2011.
In or around August 2012 and continuing until in or around November 2012, FMC Portugal
entered into a separate contract with Angolan Doctor 2 to provide purported consultancy services
for the Angolan health industry for which Angolan Doctor 2 was paid approximately â¬4,230 per
month. Angolan Doctor 2, however, never provided any services related to these consulting

agreements.

A-8
29. As aresult of improper payments made to Angolan health officials, FMC benefited

by approximately $12.6 million during the relevant time period.
Saudi Arabia
Relevant Entities and Individuals

30. âSaudi Distributor,â an entity whose identity is known to the Department and to
FMC, was a third-party distributor. FMCâs operations in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (âKSAâ)
were conducted through Saudi Distributor pursuant to a Management Assistance Agreement and
an Agency and Distributorship Agreement with FMC. The Management Assistance Agreement
and Agency and Distribution Agreement provided that Saudi Distributor would sell products on
behalf of FMC and pursuant to specific terms and conditions set by FMC. In addition, Saudi
Distributorâs finances were fully consolidated within FMCâs. Thus, Saudi Distributor and its
employees were âagentsâ of an issuer within the meaning of the FCPA, Title 15, United States
Code, Section 78dd-1(a).

31. âSaudi Distributor GM,â an individual whose identity is known to the Department
and to FMC, was the General Manager of Saudi Distributor.

32. âSaudi Technical Organization,â an entity whose identity is known to the
Department and to FMC, received funds from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and was acting in an
official capacity for or on behalf of a foreign government within the meaning of the FCPA, Title
15, United States Code, Section 78dd-1(f)(1). Saudi Technical Organization was involved in
nephrology-related activities in KSA, including the coordination of dialysis treatments in KSA.

33. âSaudi Medical Services Group,â an entity whose identity is known to the
Department and to FMC, was a medical services company. Saudi Medical Services Group was

the authorized KSA distributor for products for a German company, which developed and sold

A-9
products that could be used in connection with dialysis equipment (âGerman Company 1â). Saudi
Medical Services Group had a contract pursuant to which it would receive a commission on sales
of products purchased by FMC from German Company 1. FMC purchased certain assets and
products of German Company 1 in 2004, after which it ceased operations.

34. âSaudi JV,â an entity whose identity is known to the Department and to FMC, was
a joint venture in which FMC was a 25% shareholder. Saudi JV manufactured dialyzers at a
production plant in KSA. FMC served as the primary source of raw materials for the dialyzers
produced by Saudi JV.

35. âSaudi Doctor 1,â an individual whose identity is known to the Department and to
FMC, was a prominent doctor in KSA, the Chairman and Director General of Saudi Technical
Organization, and a âforeign officialâ within the meaning of the FCPA, Title 15, United States
Code, Section 78dd-1(f)(1). Saudi Doctor | is also affiliated with Saudi Medical Services Group.

36. âSaudi Doctor 2,â an individual whose identity is known to the Department and to
FMC, was also a prominent doctor in KSA, the Deputy Director General of Saudi Technical
Organization, and a âforeign officialâ within the meaning of the FCPA, Title 15, United States
Code, Section 78dd-1(M(1). Saudi Doctor 2 is also affiliated with Saudi Medical Services Group
and Saudi JV.

37. âSaudi Doctor 3,â an individual whose identity is known to the Department and to
FMC, was the Chief Executive Officer of a government owned and operated charity that focused
on medical care for patients in renal failure.

Conduct Relevant to Saudi Arabia
38. Between 2007 and 2012, FMC, through Saudi Distributor, made improper

payments to publicly-employed doctors and others in order to expand its market share in KSA.

A-10
39. During the relevant period, Saudi Distributor GM employed a check cashing
scheme in order to funnel cash to publicly-employed doctors. Specifically, Saudi Distributor GM
instructed employees to cash checks that had been made payable in their names and return the cash
to him. Saudi Distributor GM then arranged to have the cash delivered to Saudi government
doctors and others.

AO. Saudi Distributor GM concealed the true purpose of these transactions by falsely
recording them as âProject Marketing Expensesâ or âCollection Commissionsâ in Saudi
Distributorâs financial records, which were ultimately consolidated with FMCâs. In total, FMC
made approximately $1.7 million in payments through the check writing scheme.

41. Saudi Distributor also often made improper payments to government doctors
through sham consulting and commission agreements for which no services were ever performed.
For example, Saudi Distributor entered into a âSales Supportâ consultancy agreement with Saudi
Doctor 1 pursuant to which Saudi Doctor | received a $68,000 commission purportedly for
services rendered in connection with a 2007 tender for dialysis equipment won by Saudi
Distributor. Saudi Doctor 1, however, provided no services in connection with that tender. The
agreement was prepared after the tender had been awarded. A June 14, 2007 FMC email shows
that the FMC Project Director responsible for the business explained to his regional supervisor that
winning this tender was âcompensationâ from Saudi Technical Organization for losing an earlier
tender. In addition, on or about June 24, 2010, Saudi Distributor GM emailed Saudi Doctor 1 on
his internet-based email account, wherein he discussed getting Saudi Doctor | his commission
payments.

42. Saudi Doctor 2 was paid over $220,000 through âcommissionâ agreements.

Internal FMC communications show that these payments to Saudi Doctor 2 were viewed as

A-11
necessary to continue to do business in KSA. In 2011, for example, an email sent from Saudi JVâs
plant manager to FMC employees in Germany explained that Saudi Doctor 2 assisted in avoiding
a government inspection of its factory that âcould have shut down the factory or made it ineligible
for tenders.â

43. Saudi Distributor paid more than $90,000 to a government charity run by Saudi
Doctor 3. Saudi Distributor GM understood that such payments were necessary in order to win
contracts. In fact, in one November 2008 email from Saudi Distributor GM to FMC personnel, he
explains that Saudi Doctor 3 âinformed [] frankly that who will support the Association will get
the orders as simple as that[.]â In addition, on or about March 15, 2012, Saudi Doctor 3, using his
internet-based email account, emailed Saudi Distributor GM a draft commission contract for
helping to secure tenders for FMC. That agreement was never executed.

44. FMC also channeled improper payments through fake collection commission
agreements. Despite having salaried employees responsible for collecting outstanding debts, Saudi
Distributor entered into a commission collection agreement with the relative of a Ministry of
Health (âMOHâ) official in connection with bidding on MOH dialysis machine tenders, which
FMC ultimately won. In total, Saudi Distributor made over $200,000 in improper payments in
connection with this contract.

45. Another method by which Saudi Distributor made improper payments to Saudi
government doctors was by providing gifts and paying for travel with no business or educational
justification. Often times, the payments were made using the credit card of Saudi Distributor GM
and included luxury accommodations for the doctors and their families.

46. For example, Saudi Distributor purchased laptops as gifts for two nurses at

government hospitals. According to FMC emails, the nurses specifically requested the laptops as
gifts and an FMC consultant recommended Saudi Distributor make the purchases because
otherwise the nurses could report to MOH the fact that their hospitals did not receive certain parts
from Saudi Distributor. Emails show that the consultant also recommended the purchase of the
laptops because âotherwise we will lost the IA tender of 2008.â Saudi Distributor GM authorized
the purchase for a cost of $1,165.33.

47. In other instance, which occurred in or around January 2010, Saudi Distributor paid
for a six-night stay at the Atlantis Palm Hotel in Dubai for Saudi Doctor 2 and his wife. The trip
was recorded as related to a medical congress in Saudi Distributor records, but no evidence exists
that Saudi Doctor 2 participated or attended any such congress. The total cost of the trip was
$7,579.20.

48. In addition to the payments discussed above, Saudi Distributor also steered
improper payments to customs officials in order to clear shipments more quickly and avoid or
reduce associated fees. The improper payments were made through a third-party freight and
logistics company that served as a customs clearance agent (âCustoms Agentâ) and were
mischaracterized on invoices as âhandling chargesâ and âmiscellaneous expenses.â For example,
in or around July 2011, Saudi Distributor learned of the detention of a shipment by Saudi customs
officials for lack of country-of-origin documentation. In order to release the shipment, Customs
Agent sought the approval of a $3,200.00 payment. Saudi Distributor approved the charge for the
stated purpose of âexpediting the mentioned shipment.â Records of the transaction show that the
payment was subsequently booked as a miscellaneous âhandling charge.â In total, there were over
$1.7 million in payments to Customs Agent that lacked supporting documentation for the services

rendered.

A-13
49. Finally, in addition to the conduct discussed above, there is evidence demonstrating
that numerous documents and other records were altered or destroyed. After the FMC internal
investigation commenced in late 2012, Saudi Distributor GM directed employees to destroy or
alter company documents, to create additional fictitious records, and to lie to investigators.

50. As a result of improper payments made in Saudi Arabia, FMC benefitted by
approximately $42.7 million during the relevant period.

FCPA Accounting Violations

Conduct Relevant to Morocco

57. Between in or around October 2006 and in or around 2010, FMC and FMC
Morocco paid bribes to Morocco State-Official | for the purpose of securing an improper
advantage and assisting FMC with obtaining and retaining business in Morocco.

58. During the relevant period, in preparing a bid to develop a dialysis center at
Morocco State-Owned Military Hospital 1, FMC Employee | and FMC Morocco Executive |
devised a financial model that included provisions to pay Morocco State-Official | a âcommissionâ
that was 10% of the total order value, 50% of which would be paid during the first year (2007) and
12.5% annually thereafter. This commission was, in fact, a bribe to be paid in exchange for
Morocco State-Official 1 selecting FMC Morocco to develop the dialysis center at Morocco State-
Owned Military Hospital 1. In discussing the commission payment, FMC Employee | sent an
email saying he would meet with Morocco State-Official 1 in order to discuss and obtain additional
development projects, such as Morocco State-Owned Military Hospital 2 and Marrakesh for which

99

â[FMC Employee 1] insisted to get a certain support...ââ In addition, FMC Employee | emailed
Morocco State-Official 1 wherein he stated that 50% of Morocco State-Official 1âs âcommissionâ
amount would be given as soon as possible.

59. In or around January 2007, FMC Employee 1, FMC Morocco Executive 1, and
Morocco State-Employee | signed a â¬1.8 million contract relating to the Morocco State-Owned
Military Hospital | project. FMC received payments in connection with this contract until in or
around December 2010.

60. In or around January 2007, FMC Employee | and others concealed the first
payment to Morocco State-Official 1 by amending and backdating another FMC employeeâs
contract which allowed him to receive a bonus of â¬90,000 (half of the 10% âcommissionââ for the
â¬1.8 million project). The remaining âcommissionâ payments were disguised as bonus payments
and paid out to Morocco State-Official 1 at approximately â¬22,500 for each of the next four years
between in or around 2008 and in or around 2011 for a total of approximately â¬90,000. Each of
these payments were falsely recorded as âcommissionsâ in the books and records of FMC and
FMC Morocco.

61. Additionally, in or around 2009, FMC and FMC Morocco were preparing to make
an offer on the Morocco State-Owned Military Hospital 2 project to develop a dialysis center. In
or around January 2009, employees of FMC Morocco and FMC Germany discussed the use of a
consultant in âpromotingâ FMC Moroccoâs interest in the project, which was intended to pay
bribes to Morocco-State Official 1 in exchange for selecting FMC Morocco to develop the dialysis
center. In an email dated on or about August 27, 2009, FMC Morocco Executive | suggested to
FMC Germany employees that they not specify the purpose of the consultancy contract, noting

that they âkeep it as is, we both know the objective of this contract.â

A-16
62. On or about September 15, 2009, Morocco State-Official 1 and FMC Morocco
Executive | signed a â¬1.4 million contract for the Morocco State-Owned Military Hospital 2
project.

63. Shortly after FMC Morocco was awarded the Morocco State-Owned Military
Hospital 2 project, an FMC executive and FMC Morocco Executive | signed a service agreement
with Company A, an entity that was created in or around February or March 2009 with a stated
business purpose of providing staffing and miscellaneous services. The contract provided a vague
description of services and, although it was signed on or about September 30, 2009, it was
backdated to June 20, 2009.

64. Between in or around October 2009 and December 2010, FMC Morocco paid
Company A approximately â¬170,000 in improper payments intended for Morocco State-Official
1.

65. As a result of improper payments made to Morocco State-Official 1, FMC
benefitted by approximately $3.7 million during the relevant period.

Spain
Relevant Entities and Individuals

66. FMC Spain was a wholly owned subsidiary of FMC under the responsibility of
FMCâs EMEA Division. FMC operated in Spain through FMC Spain, and FMC Spain provided
FMC services and products in Spain. FMC Spain and its employees were âagentsâ of an issuer
within the meaning of the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-1(a).

67. âSpanish State-Owned Hospital 1,â an entity whose identity is known to the

Conduct Relevant to Spain

TA. Beginning in at least 2007 and continuing until approximately 2014, FMC Spain
made payments to publicly-employed doctors and other healthcare professionals in Spain, in
connection with public tenders in which FMC Spain sought to compete. Among other things,
FMC Spain sometimes accomplished this through (1) fake consulting agreements with publicly-
employed doctors or professionals who could influence or provide information about public
tenders; (i1) gifts or other benefits such as travel to medical conferences; and (111) donations to fund

projects for the doctors.

A-18
75. In certain public tenders, FMC Spain received advance information about tender
specifications from publicly-employed doctors or administrators, some of whom received
payments from FMC Spain. In some tenders, FMC Spain intended to influence the publicly-
employed doctors or administrators to modify aspects of the tenders before they were publicly
announced. For example, between 2008 and 2011, FMC Spain paid Spanish Doctor 1 more than
â¬8 1,000 without a consulting agreement or contract in place. In addition, from 2012 through 2014,
FMC Spain had a consulting contract with Spanish Doctor | which resulted in over â¬39,000 in
payments, and provided Spanish Doctor | with travel sponsorships.

76. In connection with a 2011 tender held by Spanish State-Owned Hospital 2, FMC
Spain submitted draft technical specifications and improvements, a draft tender scoring
methodology, and proposed scores to Spanish Doctor 1. FMC Spain was awarded the tender in
March 2011. Ultimately, this tender resulted in more than â¬1.7 million in revenue to FMC Spain.

77. FMC Spain also provided money and benefits to Spanish Doctor 2. In connection
with a 2015 tender held by Spanish State-Owned Hospital 3, FMC Spain suggested to Spanish
Doctor 2 how the tender should be drafted. According to a December 2014 email from FMC
Spainâs Sales Director, FMC âgot [Spanish Doctor 2] to decide to âsupport [FMC Spain]â to obtain
60% of the adjudication.ââ FMC Spain was later awarded 60% of the tender, which was valued at
approximately â¬2.66 million.

78. FMC Spain also entered into consulting agreements with doctors in Spain and
provided them with other financial incentives in an effort to get the doctors to influence FMC
Spain business. For example, from 2008 to 2014, pursuant to various consulting agreements, FMC
Spain paid Spanish Doctor 3 approximately â¬340,000, paid for his travel to various medical

congresses and for a trip to the United States, and paid for a two-week English language course.

A-19
79. FMC Spain also made improper payments to doctors in exchange for patient
referrals to FMC Spain clinics. The payments were channeled to the doctors through consulting
agreements with entities owned by the same doctors. In other instances, FMC Spain purchased
businesses from the doctors and, thereafter, paid the doctors for use of the buildings in which the
businesses were located.

80. For example, FMC Spain made payments and provided benefits to six publicly-
employed doctors at Spanish State-Owned Hospital 4. FMC Spain paid approximately â¬5 million
plus 5% of sales for five years for a clinic that was owned by the doctors. FMC Spain also entered
into a lease agreement with another entity owned by the six doctors to rent the space in which the
original clinic was located.

81. As a result of FMC Spainâs failure to implement reasonable internal controls, the
improper payments to doctors continued until 2014. Many of these payments were improperly
recorded as consulting expenses in the books and records of FMC and FMC Spain. During the
relevant time period, FMC benefitted by approximately $23.8 million as a result of these payments.

Turkey
Relevant Entities and Individuals

82. FMC Turkey was a wholly owned subsidiary of FMC under the responsibility of
FMCâs EMEA Division. FMC operated in Turkey through FMC Turkey, and FMC Turkey
provided FMC services and products in Turkey. FMC Turkey and its employees were âagentsâ of
an issuer within the meaning of the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-1(a).

83. âFMC Turkey Executive 1,â an individual whose identity is known to the

Department and to FMC, was a high-level executive at FMC Turkey.

A-20
84. âTurkish Doctor 1,â an individual whose identity is known to the Department and
to FMC, was a prominent nephrology doctor, a professor at a public university.

85. âJoint Venture 1,â an entity whose identity is known to the Department and to FMC,
was a partnership between FMC Turkey and Turkish Doctor 1.

86. âFMC Turkey Distributor,â an individual whose identity is known to the
Department and to FMC, was a former distributor of FMC Turkey products.

87. âTurkish Doctor 2,â an individual whose identity is known to the Department and
to FMC, was a prominent nephrologist at a Turkish state-owned hospital.

88. âJoint Venture 2,â an entity whose identity is known to the Department and to FMC,
was a partnership between FMC Turkey and Turkish Doctor 2.

Conduct Relevant to Turkey

89. Between in or around 2005 until in or around 2014, FMC Turkey entered into joint
ventures with publicly-employed doctors in exchange for those doctors directing business from
their public employer to FMC Turkey clinics.

90. Although FMC Turkey primarily developed and proposed the joint ventures, in
some instances, FMC Turkey sought approval from FMC managers in Germany, including the
FMC Acquisition Investment Committee (âAICââ) and, in some cases, the FMC BoM to establish
the joint ventures.

91. In a presentation from approximately 2007, FMC Turkey Executive 1 set forth
FMC Turkeyâs strategy to increase patient volumes and growth, and discussed a need âto select
and find ways to work with nephrologists who refer the patients from the important state hospitals.â
The presentation also included a proposal to pay salaries and bonuses to publicly-employed doctors

or enter into joint ventures in which the doctors would be given â20-30% shares.â

A-21
92. For example, in or around 2006, FMC Turkey entered into Joint Venture | with
Turkish Doctor 1, who received 35% of the joint venture shares (worth approximately $74,000 at
the time) at the time it was formed. Employees of FMC Turkey understood that Turkish Doctor
1âs shares were held in the name of a former FMC Turkey distributor, as demonstrated through
numerous emails. For example, on or about November 25, 2008, FMC Turkey Executive |
emailed FMC Executive | and another FMC executive, noting that they had established the joint
venture and given a 35% share to Turkish Doctor | in the name of former FMC Turkey distributor.

93. Similarly, in another email sent on or about November 25, 2008, FMC Turkey
Executive | noted to FMC Executive | and another FMC executive that Turkish Doctor | would
not be able to contribute to a capital increase in Joint Venture | and, as a result, they intended to
decrease his shares from 35% to 25%. When the other FMC executive questioned why âthey have
to be so cooperative to keep [Turkish Doctor 1] when heâs not paying anything,â FMC Turkey
Executive | responded that Turkish Doctor 1| has strong relations with state hospitals and that they
are ânot in the position to start a fight with this professor by diluting his shares.â

94. In or around 2010, FMC Turkey purchased Turkish Doctor 1âs shares in the joint
venture for approximately $356,000 (which was concealed by paying Turkish Doctor | through a
former FMC Turkey distributor), in part based on patient enrollment. FMC Turkey and FMC
never required Turkish Doctor | to pay for his shares in the joint venture resulting in $356,000
profit to Turkish Doctor 1.

95. In another example, in or around June 2012, FMC Turkey entered into Joint
Venture 2 with Turkish Doctor 2. FMC Turkey understood that it could not hire Turkish Doctor
2 as an employee, but evaded this issue by entering into a joint venture relationship with him.

Indeed, FMC Turkey paid for Turkish Doctor 2âs initial capital contribution for the 20% position,

A-22
which was valued at approximately $111,000. FMC Turkeyâs approval request to the FMC BoM
stated that Turkish Doctor 2 would pay for his shares through a deduction of proceeds from the
future sale of the 20% interest in the venture instead of paying up front. Turkish Doctor 2 never
paid for his shares through this proposed deduction.

96. In or around August 2012, FMC Turkey entered into a share purchase agreement
to purchase Turkish Doctor 2âs 20% interest, which was predicated on Turkish Doctor 2 doubling
the number of patients being treated at the clinic. Pursuant to the share purchase agreement
Turkish Doctor 2 also received approximately $63,000 in payments between 2012 and 2013 based
on the number of patients treated. In addition to these payments, in or around 2014, FMC Turkey
purchased Turkish Doctor 2âs shares in the joint venture for approximately $451,000 without
requiring Turkish Doctor 2 to pay for his shares. Thus, the joint venture served as a means for
FMC to pay Turkish Doctor 2 approximately $451,000 at the same time he was involved in
referring patients from his state-owned employer to the clinic.

97. As a result of FMCâs lack of reasonable internal controls, improper payments were
made to publicly-employed doctors in Turkey through joint ventures and FMC benefitted by
approximately $1.3 million during the relevant period.

West Africa
Relevant Entities and Individuals

98. FMCâs operation in West Africa fell under the responsibility of FMCâs EMEA
division. FMC operated in West Africa through FMC employees based in Germany and Morocco
and these FMC employees provided FMC services and products in French-speaking West Africa,

including Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Niger, Gabon, Chad, and Senegal. FMC

A-23
Germany and its employees were âagentsâ of an issuer within the meaning of the FCPA, Title 15,
United States Code, Section 78dd-1(a).

99. âGabon State-Owned Hospital 1,â an entity whose identity is known to the
Department and to FMC, was a state-owned and controlled hospital located in Libreville, Gabon.

100. âGabon State-Owned Hospital Employee 1,â an individual whose identity is known
to the Department and to FMC, is a high-level executive at Gabon State-Owned Hospital 1
responsible for finances.

101. âGabon State-Owned Hospital Employee 2,â an individual whose identity is known
to the Department and to FMC, is a high-level executive at Gabon State-Owned Hospital 1
responsible for accounting.

102. âGabon State-Owned Hospital Employee 3,â an individual whose identity is known
to the Department and to FMC, is a high-level executive Gabon State-Owned Hospital 1
responsible for accounting.

103. âGabon State-Owned Hospital Employee 4,â an individual whose identity is known
to the Department and to FMC, is a technician at Gabon State-Owned Hospital 1.

Conduct Relevant to West Africa

104. Between in or around 2007 and in or around 2016, FMC knowingly paid bribes to
publicly-employed health officials in Gabon and other West African countries to obtain and retain
business, specifically consisting of direct payments, concealing payments through third parties,
and concealing payments through a third-party distributorship.

105. For example, as part of the scheme, FMC employees met with representatives of
Gabon State-Owned Hospital | and proposed a five-year agreement that would include the âprices

plus the commissionâ that the officials would receive for each kit sold. On or about October 20,

A-24
2006 an FMC employee responsible for sales in West Africa reported to FMC Employee 1, stating
that the agreement would provide for a â¬12 commission for each kit sold, which was intended as
a âcommission for the three persons who sign the contract with us.â

106. In or around January 2007, FMC and Gabon State-Owned Hospital | entered into
a five year contract in which FMC would provide 10,000 kits per year, priced at â¬72 per kit. The
contract was signed by FMC Employee |, another FMC employee, Gabon State-Owned Hospital
Employee 1, Gabon State-Owned Hospital Employee 2, and Gabon State-Owned Hospital
Employee 3. In exchange for their assistance in obtaining this contract, FMC employees directed
approximately $400,000 to the officials employed by Gabon State-Owned Hospital | through sham
consultancy agreements designed to hide the âcommissions.â

107. The commission payments were booked to the General Ledger account, as
translated into English, as âProvision for export commissionsâ when in fact they were bribes.

108. In or around February 2009, FMC entered into a new contract with Gabon State-
Owned Hospital 1. The contract provided a minimum purchase by Gabon State-Owned Hospital
of 13,000 kits per year, over five years, with a new cost per kit of â¬92.5.

109. In or around the summer of 2010, FMC entered into a service agreement with
Company B. The service agreement was signed by two FMC executives and a Company B
Executive, and was backdated to January 2009. Under the agreement, FMC paid Company B â¬800
per day for purported services in West Africa. In reality, the payments to Company B were
intended to paper over the âcommissionsâ to state-owned employees who previously received
direct payments from FMC, as well as a 15% fee for Company B.

110. In addition to the conduct described above for Gabon, between in or around 2010

until in or around 2013, FMC paid Company B to make similar improper âcommissionâ payments

A-25
to state-owned hospital employees in the West African countries of Benin, Burkina Faso, Senegal,
Ivory Coast, and Niger. Further, between in or around 2010 and in or around 2012, FMC also paid
Company C to make improper âcommissionâ payments to state-owned hospital employees in
Cameroon.

111. Finally, in or around August 2012, FMC shifted its scheme from service agreements
to a distributorship model with Company B and entered into a new contract with the MOH for
Gabon specifying that sales may go through Company B. Under this contract, Company B would
now distribute FMC products to the MOH of Gabon as a conduit entity. Records show that
Company B did not actually distribute FMC products and that FMC continued to ship the products
directly to the MOH. The improper âcommissionâ payments to state-owned hospital employees
continued with the cost now concealed within the price per kit. For example, Company B invoiced
Gabon State-Owned Hospital | â¬92.50 per kit while FMC invoiced Company B only â¬ 54 per kit,
allowing Company B to keep the difference of â¬38.50 per kit. FMCâs relationship with Company
B continued until in or around 2016.

112. As a result of improper payments made to publicly-employed doctors in West
Africa through direct payments, concealing payments through third parties, and concealing
payments through a third-party distributorship, FMC benefitted by approximately $56.7 million

during the relevant period.

and, where necessary and appropriate, agents and business partners; and (b) corresponding
certifications by all such directors, officers, employees, agents, and business partners, certifying

9. The Company will maintain, or where necessary establish, an effective system for
providing guidance and advice to directors, officers, employees, and, where necessary and

compliance code, policies, and procedures, including when they need advice on an urgent basis or

in any foreign jurisdiction in which the Company operates.

process with sufficient resources for responding to, investigating, and documenting allegations of
violations of the anti-corruption laws or the Companyâs anti-corruption compliance code, policies,
and procedures.

Enforcement and Discipline

12. The Company will implement mechanisms designed to effectively enforce its
compliance code, policies, and procedures, including appropriately incentivizing compliance and
disciplining violations.

13. The Company will institute appropriate disciplinary procedures to address, among
other things, violations of the anti-corruption laws and the Companyâs anti-corruption compliance
code, policies, and procedures by the Companyâs directors, officers, and employees. Such
procedures should be applied consistently and fairly, regardless of the position held by, or
perceived importance of, the director, officer, or employee. The Company shall implement
procedures to ensure that where misconduct is discovered, reasonable steps are taken to remedy
the harm resulting from such misconduct, and to ensure that appropriate steps are taken to prevent
further similar misconduct, including assessing the internal controls, compliance code, policies,
and procedures and making modifications necessary to ensure the overall anti-corruption

compliance program is effective.

abiding by anti-corruption laws, and of the Companyâs anti-corruption compliance code, policies,

C. seeking a reciprocal commitment from agents and business partners.

15. Where necessary and appropriate, the Company will include standard provisions
in agreements, contracts, and renewals thereof with all agents and business partners that are
reasonably calculated to prevent violations of the anti-corruption laws, which may, depending
upon the circumstances, include: (a) anti-corruption representations and undertakings relating to
compliance with the anti-corruption laws; (b) rights to conduct audits of the books and records of
the agent or business partner to ensure compliance with the foregoing; and (c) rights to terminate

businesses or entities merged with the Company and will promptly:

a. train the directors, officers, employees, agents, and business partners
consistent with Paragraph 8 above on the anti-corruption laws and the Companyâs compliance

ATTACHMENT C

 

CORPORATE COMPLIANCE REPORTING
INDEPENDENT COMPLIANCE MONITOR

The duties and authority of the Independent Compliance Monitor (the âMonitorââ), and the
obligations of Fresenius Medical Care AG & Co. KGaA (the âCompanyââ), on behalf of itself and
its subsidiaries and affiliates, with respect to the Monitor and the United States Department of
Justice, Criminal Division, Fraud Section and the United States Attorneyâs Office for the District
of Massachusetts (collectively, the âDepartmentâ), are as described below:

1. The Company will retain the Monitor for a period of not less than two years (the
âTerm of the Monitorshipââ), unless the early termination provisions of Paragraph 3 of the Non-
Prosecution Agreement (the âAgreementââ) are triggered. Subject to certain conditions specified
below that would, in the sole discretion of the Department, allow for an extension of the Term of
the Monitorship, the Monitor shall be retained until the criteria in Paragraphs 19-20 below are
satisfied or the Agreement expires, whichever occurs first.

Monitorâs Mandate

2. The Monitorâs primary responsibility is to assess and monitor the Companyâs
compliance with the terms of the Agreement, including the Corporate Compliance Program in
Attachment B, so as to specifically address and reduce the risk of any recurrence of the Companyâs
misconduct. During the Term of the Monitorship, the Monitor will evaluate, in the manner set
forth below, the effectiveness of the internal accounting controls, record-keeping, and financial
reporting policies and procedures of the Company as they relate to the Companyâs current and
ongoing compliance with the FCPA and other applicable anti-corruption laws (collectively, the

âanti-corruption lawsââ), except for Fresenius Medical Care Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries, to

C-]
the extent that those entities and/or their employees and agents operate exclusively within the
United States, and take such reasonable steps as, in his or her view, may be necessary to fulfill the
foregoing mandate (the âMandateââ). Nothing in this Mandate precludes the Monitor from seeking
a briefing on the Companyâs compliance program in the United States. This Mandate shall include
an assessment of the Management Boardâs and senior managementâs commitment to, and effective
implementation of, the corporate compliance program described in Attachment B of the
Agreement.
Companyâs Obligations

3. The Company shall cooperate fully with the Monitor, and the Monitor shall have
the authority to take such reasonable steps as, in his or her view, may be necessary to be fully
informed about the Companyâs compliance program in accordance with the principles set forth
herein and applicable law, including applicable data protection and labor laws and regulations. To
that end, the Company shall: facilitate the Monitorâs access to the Companyâs documents and
resources; not limit such access, except as provided in Paragraphs 5-6; and provide guidance on
applicable local law (such as relevant data protection and labor laws). The Company shall provide
the Monitor with access to all information, documents, records, facilities, and employees, as
reasonably requested by the Monitor, that fall within the scope of the Mandate of the Monitor
under the Agreement. The Company shall use its best efforts to provide the Monitor with access
to the Companyâs former employees and its third-party vendors, agents, and consultants.

4. Any disclosure by the Company to the Monitor concerning corrupt payments, false
books and records, and internal accounting control failures shall not relieve the Company of any
otherwise applicable obligation to truthfully disclose such matters to the Department, pursuant to

the Agreement.

C-2
Withholding Access

5. The parties agree that no attorney-client relationship shall be formed between the
Company and the Monitor. In the event that the Company seeks to withhold from the Monitor
access to information, documents, records, facilities, or current or former employees of the
Company that may be subject to a claim of attorney-client privilege or to the attorney work-product
doctrine, or where the Company reasonably believes production would otherwise be inconsistent
with applicable law, the Company shall work cooperatively with the Monitor to resolve the matter
to the satisfaction of the Monitor.

6. If the matter cannot be resolved, at the request of the Monitor, the Company shall
promptly provide written notice to the Monitor and the Department. Such notice shall include a
general description of the nature of the information, documents, records, facilities or current or
former employees that are being withheld, as well as the legal basis for withholding access. The
Department may then consider whether to make a further request for access to such information,
documents, records, facilities, or employees.

Monitorâs Coordination with the
Company and Review Methodology

7. In carrying out the Mandate, to the extent appropriate under the circumstances, the
Monitor should coordinate with Company personnel, including in-house counsel, compliance
personnel, and internal auditors, on an ongoing basis. The Monitor may rely on the product of the
Companyâs processes, such as the results of studies, reviews, sampling and testing methodologies,
audits, and analyses conducted by or on behalf of the Company, as well as the Companyâs internal
resources (e.g., legal, compliance, and internal audit), which can assist the Monitor in carrying out
the Mandate through increased efficiency and Company-specific expertise, provided that the

Monitor has confidence in the quality of those resources.

C-3
8. The Monitorâs reviews should use a risk-based approach, and thus, the Monitor is
not expected to conduct a comprehensive review of all business lines, all business activities, or all
markets. In carrying out the Mandate, the Monitor should consider, for instance, risks presented
by: (a) the countries and industries in which the Company operates, other than Fresenius Medical
Care Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries, to the extent that those entities and/or their employees and
agents operate exclusively within the United States; (b) current and future business opportunities
and transactions; (c) current and potential business partners, including third parties and joint
ventures, and the business rationale for such relationships; (d) the Companyâs gifts, travel, and
entertainment interactions with foreign officials; and (e) the Companyâs involvement with foreign
officials, including the amount of foreign government regulation and oversight of the Company,
such as licensing and permitting, and the Companyâs exposure to customs and immigration issues
in conducting its business affairs.

9. In undertaking the reviews to carry out the Mandate, the Monitor shall formulate
conclusions based on, among other things: (a) inspection of relevant documents, including the
Companyâs current anti-corruption policies and procedures; (b) on-site observation of selected
systems and procedures of the Company at sample sites, including internal accounting controls,
record-keeping, and internal audit procedures; (c) meetings with, and interviews of, relevant
current and, where appropriate, former directors, officers, employees, business partners, agents,
and other persons at mutually convenient times and places; and (d) analyses, studies, and testing
of the Companyâs compliance program.

Monitorâs Written Work Plans
10. To carry out the Mandate, during the Term of the Monitorship, the Monitor shall

conduct an initial review and prepare an initial report, followed by at least one follow-up review
and report as described in Paragraphs 16-18 below. With respect to the initial report, after
consultation with the Company and the Department, the Monitor shall prepare the first written
work plan within thirty (30) calendar days of being retained, and the Company and the Department
shall provide comments within fifteen (15) calendar days after receipt of the written work plan.
With respect to each follow-up report, after consultation with the Company and the Department,
the Monitor shall prepare a written work plan at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to commencing
a review, and the Company and the Department shall provide comments within fifteen calendar
days after receipt of the written work plan. Any disputes between the Company and the Monitor
with respect to any written work plan shall be decided by the Department in its sole discretion.

11. All written work plans shall identify with reasonable specificity the activities the
Monitor plans to undertake in execution of the Mandate, including a written request for documents.
The Monitorâs work plan for the initial review shall include such steps as are reasonably necessary
to conduct an effective initial review in accordance with the Mandate, including by developing an
understanding, to the extent the Monitor deems appropriate, of the facts and circumstances
surrounding any prior FCPA violations that gave rise to this Agreement or other applicable anti-
corruption laws. In developing such understanding the Monitor is to rely to the extent possible on
available information and documents provided by the Company. The Monitor shall not conduct
his or her own inquiry into the historical events that gave rise to the Agreement.

Initial Review

12. The initial review shall commence no later than sixty (60) calendar days from the
date of the engagement of the Monitor (unless otherwise agreed by the Company, the Monitor, and
the Department). The Monitor shall issue a written report within one hundred twenty calendar

days of commencing the initial review, setting forth the Monitorâs assessment and, if necessary,

C-5
making recommendations reasonably designed to improve the effectiveness of the Companyâs
program for ensuring compliance with the anti-corruption laws. The Monitor should consult with
the Company concerning his or her findings and recommendations on an ongoing basis and should
consider the Companyâs comments and input to the extent the Monitor deems appropriate. The
Monitor may also choose to share a draft of his or her reports with the Company and the
Department prior to finalizing them. The Monitorâs reports need not recite or describe
comprehensively the Companyâs history or compliance policies, procedures and practices, but
rather may focus on those areas with respect to which the Monitor wishes to make
recommendations, if any, for improvement or which the Monitor otherwise concludes merit
particular attention. The Monitor shall provide the report to the Companyâs Management Board
and contemporaneously transmit copies to both the (a) Deputy Chief - FCPA Unit, Fraud Section,
Criminal Division, U.S. Department of Justice, 1400 New York Avenue N.W., Bond Building,
Eleventh Floor, Washington, D.C. 20005; and (b) Chief â Economic Crimes Unit, United States
Attorneyâs Office, District of Massachusetts, 1 Courthouse Way, Suite 9200, Boston, MA 02210.
After consultation with the Company, the Monitor may extend the time period for issuance of the
initial report for a brief period of time with prior written approval of the Department.

13. Within one hundred twenty (120) calendar days after receiving the Monitorâs initial
report, the Company shall adopt and implement all recommendations in the report, unless, within
thirty (30) calendar days of receiving the report, the Company notifies in writing the Monitor and
the Department of any recommendations that the Company considers unduly burdensome,
inconsistent with applicable law or regulation, impractical, excessively expensive, or otherwise
inadvisable. With respect to any such recommendation, the Company need not adopt that

recommendation within the one hundred twenty (120) calendar days of receiving the report but

C-6
shall propose in writing to the Monitor and the Department an alternative policy, procedure, or
system designed to achieve the same objective or purpose. As to any recommendation on which
the Company and the Monitor do not agree, such parties shall attempt in good faith to reach an
agreement within fifteen (15) calendar days after the Company serves the written notice.

14. In the event the Company and the Monitor are unable to agree on an acceptable
alternative proposal, the Company shall promptly consult with the Department. The Department
may consider the Monitorâs recommendation and the Companyâs reasons for not adopting the
recommendation in determining whether the Company has fully complied with its obligations
under the Agreement. Pending such determination, the Company shall not be required to
implement any contested recommendation(s).

15. With respect to any recommendation that the Monitor determines cannot
reasonably be implemented within one hundred twenty (120) calendar days after receiving the
report, the Monitor may extend the time period for implementation with prior written approval of
the Department.

Follow-Up Review

16. The follow-up review shall commence no later than one hundred twenty (120)
calendar days after the issuance of the initial report (unless otherwise agreed by the Company, the
Monitor and the Department). The Monitor shall issue a written follow-up report within one
hundred fifty (150) calendar days of commencing the follow-up review, setting forth the Monitorâs
assessment and, if necessary, making recommendations in the same fashion as set forth in
Paragraph 12 with respect to the initial review. The Monitor shall also certify whether the
Companyâs compliance program, including its policies and procedures, is reasonably designed and

implemented to prevent and detect violations of the anti-corruption laws. After consultation with
the Company, the Monitor may extend the time period for issuance of the follow-up report for a
brief period of time with prior written approval of the Department.

17. Within one hundred twenty (120) calendar days after receiving the Monitorâs
follow-up report, the Company shall adopt and implement all recommendations in the report,
unless, within thirty (30) calendar days after receiving the report, the Company notifies in writing
the Monitor and the Department concerning any recommendations that the Company considers
unduly burdensome, inconsistent with applicable law or regulation, impractical, excessively
expensive, or otherwise inadvisable. With respect to any such recommendation, the Company
need not adopt that recommendation within the one hundred twenty (120) calendar days of
receiving the report but shall propose in writing to the Monitor and the Department an alternative
policy, procedure, or system designed to achieve the same objective or purpose. As to any
recommendation on which the Company and the Monitor do not agree, such parties shall attempt
in good faith to reach an agreement within fifteen (15) calendar days after the Company serves the
written notice.

18. In the event the Company and the Monitor are unable to agree on an acceptable
alternative proposal, the Company shall promptly consult with the Department. The Department
may consider the Monitorâs recommendation and the Companyâs reasons for not adopting the
recommendation in determining whether the Company has fully complied with its obligations
under the Agreement. Pending such determination, the Company shall not be required to
implement any contested recommendation(s).

Certification of Compliance
and Termination of the Monitorship

19. At the conclusion of the ninety (90) calendar day period following the issuance of

the follow-up report, if the Monitor believes that the Companyâs compliance program is reasonably

C-8
designed and implemented to detect and prevent violations of the anti-corruption laws and is
functioning effectively, the Monitor shall certify the Companyâs compliance with its compliance
obligations under the Agreement. The Monitor shall then submit to the Department a written
report (âCertification Reportâ) within forty (40) calendar days. The Certification Report shall set
forth an overview of the Companyâs remediation efforts to date, including the implementation
status of the Monitorâs recommendations, and an assessment of the sustainability of the
Companyâs remediation efforts. The Certification Report should also recommend the scope of the
Companyâs future self-reporting. Also at the conclusion of the one hundred twenty (120) calendar
day period following the issuance of the follow-up report, the Company shall certify in writing to
the Department, with a copy to the Monitor, that the Company has adopted and implemented all
of the Monitorâs recommendations in the initial and follow-up report(s), or the agreed-upon
alternatives. The Monitor or the Company may extend the time period for issuance of the
Certification Report or the Companyâs certification, respectively, with prior written approval of
the Department.

20. At such time as the Department approves the Certification Report and the
Companyâs certification, the monitorship shall be terminated, and the Company will be permitted
to self-report to the Department on its enhanced compliance obligations for the remainder of the
term of the Agreement. The Department, however, reserves the right to terminate the monitorship
absent certification by the Monitor, upon a showing by the Company that termination is,
nevertheless, in the interests of justice.

21. If permitted to self-report to the Department, the Company shall thereafter submit
to the Department a written report every six months setting forth a complete description of its

remediation efforts to date, its proposals to improve the Companyâs internal accounting controls,

C-9
policies, and procedures for ensuring compliance with the anti-corruption laws, and the proposed
scope of the subsequent reviews. The report shall be transmitted to both the (a) Deputy Chief â
FCPA Unit, Fraud Section, Criminal Division, U.S. Department of Justice, 1400 New York
Avenue, N.W., Bond Building, Eleventh Floor, Washington, D.C. 20005, or his or her designee;
and (b) Chief - Economic Crimes Unit, United States Attorneyâs Office, District of Massachusetts,
1 Courthouse Way, Suite 9200, Boston, MA 02210, or his or her designee. The Company may
extend the time period for issuance of the self-report with prior written approval of the Department.
Extension of the Term of the Monitorship

22. If, however, at the conclusion of the ninety (90) calendar-day period following the
issuance of the follow-up report, the Department concludes that the Company has not by that time
successfully satisfied its compliance obligations under the Agreement, the Term of the
Monitorship shall be extended for a reasonable period of time not to exceed one year.

23. Under such circumstances, the Monitor shall commence the second follow-up
review no later than sixty (60) calendar days after the Department concludes that the Company has
not successfully satisfied its compliance obligations under the Agreement (unless otherwise agreed
by the Company, the Monitor, and the Department). The Monitor shall issue a written follow-up
report within one hundred twenty (120) calendar days of commencing the second follow-up review
in the same fashion as set forth in Paragraph 12 with respect to the initial review and in accordance
with the procedures for follow-up reports set forth in Paragraphs 16-18. A determination to
terminate the monitorship shall then be made in accordance with Paragraphs 19-20.

24. If, after completing the second follow-up review, the Department again concludes
that the Company has not successfully satisfied its obligations under the Agreement with respect

to the Monitorâs Mandate, the Term of the Monitorship shall be extended until expiration of the

C-10
Agreement, and the Monitor shall commence a third follow-up review within sixty (60) calendar

days after the Department concludes that the Company has not successfully satisfied its

compliance obligations under the Agreement (unless otherwise agreed by the Company, the

Monitor, and the Department). The Monitor shall issue a written follow-up report within one

hundred twenty (120) calendar days of commencing the third follow-up review in the same fashion

as set forth in Paragraph 12 with respect to the initial review and in accordance with the procedures

for follow-up reports set forth in Paragraphs 16-18.
Monitorâs Discovery of Potential or Actual Misconduct

25. (a) Except as set forth below in sub-paragraphs (b) and (c), should the Monitor
discover during the course of his or her engagement that:

e improper payments or anything else of value may have been offered,

promised, made, or authorized by any entity or person within the Company

or any entity or person working, directly or indirectly, for or on behalf of

the Company;
e the Company may have maintained false books, records or accounts; or,
e the Company may have failed to implement a system of internal accounting

controls that is sufficient to accurately record the Companyâs transactions
(collectively, âPotential Misconductâ), the Monitor shall immediately report the Potential
Misconduct to the Companyâs General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer, and/or Audit
Committee for further action, unless the Potential Misconduct was already so disclosed. The
Monitor also may report Potential Misconduct to the Department at any time, and shall report

Potential Misconduct to the Department when it requests the information.

C-11
(b) If the Monitor believes that any Potential Misconduct actually occurred or
may constitute a criminal or regulatory violation (âActual Misconductâ), the Monitor shall
immediately report the Actual Misconduct to the Department. When the Monitor discovers Actual
Misconduct, the Monitor shall disclose the Actual Misconduct solely to the Department, and, in
such cases, disclosure of the Actual Misconduct to the General Counsel, Chief Compliance
Officer, and/or the Audit Committee of the Company should occur as the Department and the
Monitor deem appropriate under the circumstances.

(c) The Monitor shall address in his or her reports the appropriateness of the
Companyâs response to disclosed Potential Misconduct or Actual Misconduct, whether previously
disclosed to the Department or not. Further, if the Company or any entity or person working
directly or indirectly on behalf of the Company withholds information necessary for the
performance of the Monitorâs responsibilities and the Monitor believes that such withholding is
without just cause, the Monitor shall also immediately disclose that fact to the Department and
address the Companyâs failure to disclose the necessary information in his or her reports.

(d) The Company nor anyone acting on its behalf shall take any action to
retaliate against the Monitor for any such disclosures or for any other reason.

Meetings During Pendency of Monitorship
26. The Monitor shall meet with the Department within thirty (30) calendar days after
providing each report to the Department to discuss the report, to be followed by a meeting between
the Department, the Monitor, and the Company.
27. At least annually, and more frequently if appropriate, representatives from the

Company and the Department will meet together to discuss the monitorship and any suggestions,

C-12
comments, or improvements the Company may wish to discuss with or propose to the Department,
including with respect to the scope or costs of the monitorship.
Contemplated Confidentiality of Monitorâs Reports

28. The reports will likely include proprietary, financial, confidential, and competitive
business information. Moreover, public disclosure of the reports could discourage cooperation, or
impede pending or potential government investigations and thus undermine the objectives of the
monitorship. For these reasons, among others, the reports and the contents thereof are intended to
remain and shall remain non-public, except as otherwise agreed to by the parties in writing, or
except to the extent that the Department determines in its sole discretion that disclosure would be
in furtherance of the Departmentâs discharge of its duties and responsibilities or is otherwise

required by law.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Friday, March 29, 2019

Fresenius Medical Care Agrees to Pay $231 Million in Criminal Penalties and Disgorgement to
Resolve Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Charges

Fresenius Medical Care AG & Co. KGaA (Fresenius), a German-based provider of medical products and services, has agreed to pay
approximately $231 million to resolve investigations by the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) into
violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) in connection with Freseniusâs participation in various corrupt schemes to obtain business
in multiple foreign countries.

Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Department's Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Andrew E. Lelling of the District of
Massachusetts, Assistant Director Robert Johnson of the FBI's Criminal Investigative Division and Special Agent in Charge Joseph R. Bonavolonta
of the FBI Boston Field Division made the announcement.

According to Freseniusâs admissions in connection with the resolution, between 2007 and 2016, Fresenius paid bribes to publicly employed
health and/or government officials to obtain or retain business in Angola and Saudi Arabia. In Angola and Saudi Arabia, as well as in Morocco,
Spain, Turkey and countries in West Africa, Fresenius knowingly and willfully failed to implement reasonable internal accounting controls over
financial transactions and failed to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflected the transactions, the company admitted.

âFresenius doled out millions of dollars in bribes across the globe to gain a competitive advantage in the medical services industry, profiting to
the tune of over $140 million,â said Assistant Attorney General Benczkowski. âTodayâs resolution, under which Fresenius has agreed to retain
an independent compliance monitor for at least two years, reflects the Departmentâs firm commitment to both rooting out bribery and
promoting the kind of effective corporate compliance programs that will prevent misconduct going forward.â

âBribery, in all forms, is corrosive and illegal,â said U.S. Attorney Lelling. âAs todayâs announcement makes clear, this Office will continue its
long tradition of aggressively investigating companies and individuals who use bribes and kickbacks to gain an unfair and illicit business
advantage, or who deliberately turn a blind eye to that conduct.â

âThis case shows the continued commitment of the FBI and our partners to investigate bribery and corruption worldwide,â said FBI Assistant
Director Robert Johnson. âThe FBI's dedicated International Corruption Squads across the United States will continue to combat foreign
corruption that reaches our shores and send a strong message that, no matter how long it takes, we will not wane in our efforts to uphold the
law.â

âThis case shows the FBI will hold accountable those who treat corruption as the cost of doing business,â said FBI Special Agent in Charge
Bonavolonta. âFreseniusâs admissions are incredibly concerning because no company should break the law by paying-off international partners
to obtain or retain business. We will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to root out corrupt schemes and ensure they do not
become common practice at the expense of other hard-working businesses.â

In Angola, Fresenius offered or provided things of value to an Angolan military health officer who exercised authority over the Angolan state-
owned military hospital in his role as an officer in the Medical Services Division of the Angolan Armed Forces and his family, as well as
prominent Angolan government-employed nephrologists. Specifically, Fresenius offered these individuals shares in a joint venture in
Freseniusâs local subsidiary, specifically, 15 percent to the Angolan military health officer and 15 percent to a publicly employed doctor, storage
contracts with a company owned by the sons of the Angolan military health officer, to provide warehousing space, however, no Fresenius
products were ever stored at the warehouse, and consultancy agreements with publicly employed doctors for which no services were ever
performed, all for the purpose of securing an improper advantage and assisting Fresenius with obtaining and retaining business in Angola.

In Saudi Arabia, Fresenius offered or provided things of value to Saudi Arabian health officials and publicly employed doctors who directed or
were employed by a Saudi medical organization and a governmental charity. Specifically, Fresenius engaged in a check-cashing scheme where
employees were directed to cash checks that had been made payable in their names and return the cash to the general manager of Freseniusâs
distributor and agent where he [the agent] then arranged to have the cash delivered to Saudi government doctors and others. In addition,
publicly employed doctors were awarded sham consulting and commission agreements for which no services were ever performed. Fresenius
also entered into fake collection commission agreements, made payments to a government charity, and gave gifts and made payments to
publicly employed doctors for travel with no business or educational justification, the company admitted.

In Morocco, Fresenius paid bribes through a sham commission to a Moroccan state official for the purpose of obtaining contracts to develop
kidney dialysis centers at Moroccan state-owned military hospitals. The sham commission would pay 10 percent of the value of the contract to
the Moroccan state official and was disguised as a bonus payment to a Fresenius employee. In Spain, Fresenius entered into fictitious
consulting agreements with publicly employed doctors or professionals who could influence or provide information about public tenders. For
example, between 2008 and 2011, Fresenius paid a publicly employed doctor more than â¬81,000 without a consulting agreement or contract in
place. This publicly employed doctor was the head of nephrology at a Spanish state-owned hospital that ultimately awarded Fresenius a tender
in 2011. Further, Fresenius gave gifts or provided other benefits such as travel to medical conferences, and made donations to fund projects for
the doctors, the company admitted. In Turkey, Fresenius entered into joint ventures with publicly employed doctors in exchange for those
doctors directing business from their public employer to Fresenius clinics in Turkey. For example, in or around 2006, Fresenius entered into a
joint venture with a publicly employed Turkish doctor, who received 35 percent of the joint venture shares (worth approximately $74,000 at the
time) at the time it was formed. In 2010, Fresenius purchased the doctorâs shares and never required the doctor to pay for his shares in the
joint venture resulting in $356,000 profit to the doctor. In West Africa, Fresenius knowingly paid bribes to publicly employed health officials and
government-employed doctors in numerous countries, including Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Ivory Coast, Niger, Gabon, Chad and
Senegal. For example, Fresenius employees met with representatives of a Gabon state-owned hospital and proposed a five-year agreement
that would include the âprices plus the commissionâ that the officials would receive for each kit sold. A Fresenius employee responsible for
sales in West Africa reported that the agreement would provide for a â¬12 commission for each kit sold, which was intended as a âcommission
for the three persons who sign the contract with us.â Fresenius paid these bribes through a combination of direct payments, payments through
third parties and payments through a third-party distributorship, all to obtain and retain business in those countries, the company admitted.

In total, Fresenius admitted to earning more than $140 million in profits from the corrupt schemes.

To resolve the case, Fresenius entered into a nonprosecution agreement (NPA) with the Department and agreed to pay a total criminal penalty
of $84,715,273. As part of the NPA, Fresenius also agreed to continue to cooperate with the Departmentâs investigation, enhance its
compliance program, implement rigorous internal controls and retain an independent corporate compliance monitor for at least two years.

The Department reached this resolution based on a number of factors. Notably, although Fresenius voluntarily self-disclosed the misconduct in
April 2012, the company did not timely respond to certain requests by the Department and, at times, did not provide fulsome responses to
requests for information. In addition, misconduct occurred in 13 countries, yielded profits of more than $140 million and continued in certain
countries until 2016. Moreover, the company has not yet had the opportunity to test the effectiveness of its compliance enhancements. In light
of all the factors, the company did not qualify for a declination under the Corporate Enforcement Policy; however, the company was afforded a
reduction of 40 percent below the low end of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines fine range. As part of the resolution, the company agreed to an
independent compliance monitor for a term of two years, followed by an additional year of self-reporting to the Department.

Fresenius settled a related FCPA matter with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) today, and will pay $147 million in
disgorgement and prejudgment interest to the SEC, which the Department credited in its resolution, bringing the total amount paid by Fresenius
to over $231 million.

This case is being investigated by the FBI's International Corruption Squad in New York and the FBI's Boston Field Office. Trial Attorneys Paul A.
Hayden and Sonali D. Patel of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Jordi de Llano of the District of Massachusetts
are prosecuting the case.

The Department appreciates the significant cooperation and assistance provided by the SEC in this matter.

The Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice Departmentâs
Fraud Section FCPA enforcement efforts can be found at www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.

institution, affecting interstate and foreign commerce, in criminally derived property of a value
Fd

 

greater than $10,000, such property having been derived from a specified unlawful activity (i.e. a
violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (âFCPAâ), in violation of Title 15, United States
Code, Section 78dd-3) in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1956(h).

3. The defendant is aware that the sentence will be imposed by the Court after
considering the advisory Federal Sentencing Guidelines and Policy Statements (hereinafter
âSentencing Guidelinesâ). The defendant acknowledges and understands that the Court will
compute an advisory sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines and that the applicable guidelines
will be determined by the Court relying in part on the results of a pre-sentence investigation by the
Courtâs probation office, which investigation will commence after the guilty plea has been entered,
The defendant is also aware that, under certain circumstances, the Court may depart from the
advisory Sentencing Guidelines range that it has computed, and may raise or lower that advisory
sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines. The defendant is further aware and understands that
the Court is required to consider the advisory guideline range determined under the Sentencing
Guidelines, but is not bound to impose a sentence within that advisory range; the Court is permitted
to tailor the ultimate sentence in light of other statutory concerns, and such sentence may be either
more severe or less severe than the Sentencing Guidelinesâ advisory range. Knowing these facts,
the defendant understands and acknowledges that the Court has the authority to impose any
sentence within and up to the statutory maximum authorized by law for the offense identified in
paragraph two and that the defendant may not withdraw his plea solely as a result of the sentence
imposed, |

2
Case $:18-c7r-80054-RLR Document 24 Erterect om FLSD Docket OS/2s/2018 Page 3 of il

Court may impose a fine of up to $250,000 or not more than twice the amount of the criminally
derived property involved in the transaction relating to the offense set forth in paragraph two
above, and the Court may also order forfeiture and restitution.

5. The defendant further understands and acknowledges that, in addition to any

Sour Gyr We Â®Q zhrolaie
sentence imposed under paragraph three of this agreement, a special assessment in the amount of
$100 will be imposed on the defendant. The defendant agrees that any special assessment
imposed shall be paid at the time of sentencing. Ifthe defendant is financially unable to pay the
special assessment, the defendant agrees to present evidence to the Government and the Court at
the time of sentencing as to the reasons for the defendantâs failure to pay.

6. The Government reserves the right to inform the Court and the probation office of
all facts pertinent to the sentencing process, including all relevant information concerning the
offenses committed, whether charged or not, as well as concerning the defendant and the
defendantâs background. Subject only to the express terms of any agreed-upon sentencing
recommendations contained in this agreement, the Government further reserves the right to make
âany recommendation as to the quality and quantity of punishment.

7. The Government agrees that it will recommend at sentencing that the Court reduce
by two levels the Sentencing Guidelines level applicable to the defendantâs offense, pursuant to
Section 3E1.1(a) of the Sentencing Guidelines, based upon the defendantâs recognition and
affirmative and timely acceptance of personal responsibility. If, at the time of sentencing the -
defendantâs offense level is determined to be 16 or greater, the Government will file a motion
requesting an additional one level decreaseâ pursuant to Section 3E1.1(b) of the Sentencing
Guidelines, stating that the defendant has assisted authorities in the investigation or prosecution of
the defendantâs own misconduct by timely notifying authorities of the defendantâs intention to

Case 9:18-cr-80054-RLR Document 14 Eriterect on FLSD Docket OS/2s/2018 Page 4of il

{

-âentera plea of guilty, thereby permitting the Government to avoid preparing for trial and permitting
the Government and the Court to allocate their resources efficiently. The Government, however,
will not be required to make this motion and this recommendation if the defendant: (a) fails or
refuses to make a full, accurate and complete disclosure to the probation office of the
circumstances surrounding the relevant offense conduct; (b) is found to have misrepresented facts
to the Government prior to entering into this plea agreement; or (c) commits any misconduct after
entering into this plea agreement, including, but not limited to, committing a state or federal
offense, violating any term of release, or making false statements or misrepresentations to any
governmental entity or official.

8. The defendant agrees that he shall cooperate fully with the Government by: (a)
providing truthful and complete information and testimony, and producing documents, records and
other evidence, when called upon by the Government, whether in interviews, before a grand jury,
or at any trial or other Court proceeding; (b) appearing at such grand jury proceedings, hearings,
trials, and other judicial proceedings, and at meetings, as may be required by the Government; and
(c) if requested by the Government, working in an undercover role under the supervision of, and
in compliance with, law enforcement officers and agents. In addition, the defendant agrees that
he will not protect any person or entity through false information or omission, that he will not

9. The Government reserves the right to evaluate the nature and extent of the
defendantâs cooperation and to make that cooperation, or lack thereof, known to the Court at the
time of sentencing. If in the sole and unreviewable judgment of the Government, the defendantâs
cooperation is of such quality and significance to the investigation or prosecution of other criminal

matters as to warrant the Courtâs downward departure from the advisory sentencing range

4
 

calculated under the Sentencing Guidelines and/or any applicable minimum mandatory sentence,
the Government may make a motion prior to sentencing pursuant to Section 5K1.1 of the
Sentencing Guidelines and/or Title 18, United States Code, Section 3553(e), or subsequent to
sentencing pursuant to Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, informing the Court
that the defendant has provided substantial assistance and recommending that the defendantâs
sentence be reduced. The defendant understands and agrees, however, that nothing in this
agreement requires the: Government to file any such motions, and that the Governmentâs
assessment of the quality and significance of the defendantâs cooperation shall be binding as it
relates to the appropriateness of the Governmentâs filing or non-filing of a motion to reduce
sentence. |

10. The defendant understands and acknowledges that the Court is under no obligation
to grant a motion for reduction of sentence filed by the Government. In addition, the defendant
further understands and acknowledges that the Court is under no obligation of any type to reduce
the defendantâs sentence because of the defendantâs cooperation.

11. The defendant agrees to forfeit to the United States voluntarily and immediately-all
property, real or personal, which constitutes or is derived from proceeds traceable to the violation
of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1956(h) charged in the Information. The defendant
agrees to consent to the entry of orders of forfeiture for such property and for a money judgment
equal in value to the total amount of proceeds traceable to his offense of conviction. The
defendant admits and agrees that the conduct described in the Information and Factual Proffer
provides a sufficient factual and statutory basis for the forfeiture of the property sought by the

Government.
Case $:18-cr-80054-RLR Docurnent 14 Entered on FLSD Docket OG/23/2018 Page Gof 1h

- 12. The defendant agrees to waive any appeal of the forfeiture. The defendant waives
the requirements of Rules 32.2 and 43(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure regarding
notice of the forfeiture in the Information, announcement of the forfeiture at sentencing, and
incorporation of the forfeiture in the judgment. The defendant also waives any failure by the
Court to advise the defendant of any applicable forfeiture at the time the guilty plea is accepted as
required by Rule 11(b)(1)(J) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The defendant further
agrees to waive any applicable time limits for the initiation of administrative or judicial forfeiture
proceeding and/or further notification of any such forfeiture brought against the property sought
- for forfeiture. |

13. The defendant also agrees to assist the Government in all proceedings,
administrative or judicial, involving forfeiture to the United States of any property, including
substitute property, regardless of its nature or form, real or personal, which the defendant or others
- known to the defendant, have accumulated as a result of illegal activities. The defendant agrees
that the United States shall, at its option, be entitled to forfeiture of any property (substitute assets)
of the defendant to satisfy the money judgment. The defendant further agrees to take all steps
necessary to locate property that could be used to satisfy the forfeiture money judgment and to
pass title to the United States before the defendantâs sentencing. To that end, the defendant agrees
to fully assist the Government in the recovery and return to the United States of any assets, or
portions thereof, wherever located. The assistance shall include: identification of any property
subject to forfeiture, agreement to the entry of an order enjoining the transfer or encumbrance of

such property, and the transfer of such property to the United States by delivery to the Government,

upon the Governmentâs request, any necessary and appropriate documentation, including consents .

to forfeiture and quit claim deeds, to deliver good and marketable title to such property. The

6

=~

(

defendant knowingly and voluntarily agrees to waive any claim or defense the defendant may have .
under the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution, including any claim of excessive
fine or penalty with respect to the forfeited assets.

14. The defendant further understands that forfeiture is independent of any
assessments, fines, costs, restitution, or any other penalty that may be imposed by the Court. The
defendant knowingly and voluntarily waives any claim or defense he may have under the Eighth
Amendment to the United States Constitution, including any claim of excessive fine or penalty
with respect to the forfeited property. |

15. The defendant agrees to make full and accurate disclosure of his financial affairs to
the Government, and expressly authorizes the Government to obtain a credit report. The
defendant agrees that within 10 calendar days of his change of plea and upon request of the
Government. the defendant shall submit a completed Financial Disclosure Statement (form
provided by the United States), and shall fully disclose and identify all assets in which he has any
interest and/or over which the defendant exercises control, directly or indirectly, including those
held by a spouse, nominee, or other third party. .

16. The defendant is aware that Title 18, United States Code, Section 3742 and Title
28, United States Code, Section 1291 afford the defendant the right to appeal the sentence imposed
in this case. Acknowledging this, in exchange for the undertakings made by the Government in
this plea agreement, the defendant hereby waives all rights conferred by Sections 3742 and 1291
to appeal any sentence imposed, including any restitution order, or to appeal the manner in which
the sentence was imposed, unless the sentence exceeds the maximum permitted by statute or is the
result of an upward departure and/or an upward variance from the advisory guideline range that
the Court establishes at sentencing. The defendant further understands that nothing in this

7
Case 9:18-cr-80084-RLR Document 14 Eritered on FLSD Docket O3/ea/2018 Page 8 of 11

agreement shall affect the Governmentâs right and/or duty to appeal as set forth in Title 18, United
States Code, Section 3742(b) and Title 28, United States Code, Section 1291. However, if the
Government appeals the defendantâs sentence pursuant to Sections 3742(b) and 1291, the
defendant shall be released from the above waiver of appellate rights. In addition, the defendant
âexpressly waives any argument that (1) the statute(s) to which the defendant is pleading guilty is
unconstitutional and (2) the admitted conduct does not fall within the scope of the statute(s). By
signing this agreement, the defendant acknowledges that the defendant has discussed the appeal
waiver set forth in this agreement with the defendantâs attorney.

17. The defendant is aware that the sentence has not yet been determined by the Court.
The defendant also is aware that any estimate of the probable sentencing range or sentence that the
defendant may receive, whether that estimate comes from the defendantâs attorney, the
Government, or the probation office, is a prediction, not a promise, and is not binding on the
Government, the probation office, or the Court. The defendant understands further that any
recommendation that the Goverment makes to the Court as to sentencing, whether pursuant to
this agreement or otherwise, is not binding on the Court and the Court may disregard the -
recommendation in its entirety. The defendant understands and acknowledges, as previously
acknowledged in paragraph three above, that the defendant may not withdraw his plea based upon
the Courtâs decision not to accept a sentencing recommendation made by the defendant, the
Government, or a recommendation made jointly by the defendant and the Government.

18. The defendant recognizes that pleading guilty may have consequences with respect
to the defendantâs immigration status if the defendant is not:a citizen of the United States. Under
federal law, a broad range of crimes are removable offenses, including the offense to which the
defendant is pleading guilty. Removal and other immigration consequences are the subject of a

8
Case $:18-cr-80054-RLR Document 24 Eriterect on FLSD Docket OS/2s/2018 Page Sof il

separate proceeding, however, and the defendant understands that no one, including the
defendantâs attorney or the Court, can predict to a certainty the effect of the defendantâs conviction
on the defendantâs immigration status. The defendant nevertheless affirms that the defendant
wants to plead guilty regardless of any immigration consequences that the defendantâs plea may
entail, even if the consequence is the defendantâs automatic removal from the United States.

19. | The Government and the defendant stipulate to and agree not to contest the facts in
the Factual Proffer, and stipulate that such facts, in accordance with Rule 11(b)(3) of the Federal
Rules of Criminal Procedure, provide a sufficient factual basis for the plea of guilty in this case.
The defendant agrees that the facts in the Factual Proffer are true and correct to the best of the
defendantâs knowledge. Because the factual basis set forth in the Factual Proffer has the limited
purpose of supporting the defendantâs guilty plea to the charge discussed in paragraph two, the
factual basis set forth in the Factual Proffer does not purport to represent all facts and
circumstances relating to the defendantâs participation. Similarly, the factual basis in the Factual
Proffer is not intended to identify all knowledge the defendant might have of the unlawful activity
of other individuals.

20. In the event the defendant withdraws from this agreement prior to or after pleading
guilty to the charge identified in paragraph two above, or should the Government, in its sole .
discretion, determine that the defendant has failed to fully comply with any of the terms of this
plea agreement, the Government will be released from its obligations under this agreement, and
the defendant agrees and understands that:

(a) the defendant thereby waives any protection afforded by any proffer letter agreement
between the parties, Section 1B1.8 of the Sentencing Guidelines, Rule 11(f) of the Federal Rules
of Criminal Procedure, and Rule 410 of the Federal Rules of Evidence;

9
Case 9:18-cr-80054-RLR Documentid Entered on FLSD Docket O3/23/2018 Page 10 of 11

(b) that any statements made by the defendant as part of the plea discussions, any
debriefings or interviews, or in this agreement, whether made prior to or after the execution of this
agreement, will âbe admissible against him without any limitation in any civil or criminal
proceeding brought by the Government;

| (c) the defendantâs waiver of any defense based on the statute of limitations and venue,
including the waiver set forth in this agreement, or any defense based on the passage of time in
filing an Indictment or Information, referred to herein, shall remain in full force and effect:

(d) the defendant stipulates to the admissibility and authenticity, in any case brought by the
United States inâ any way related to the facts referred to in this agreement, of any documents
provided by the defendant or the defendantâs representatives to any state of federal agency and/or
the Government; and

(e) the defendant has adopted the entire factual basis as the defendantâs statements, and the
defendant has stipulated to the admissibility of the Factual Proffer in any case brought by the
United States.

21. This is the entire agreement and understanding between the Government and the

defendant. There are no other agreements, promises, representations, or understandings.

defendantâs offense level is determined to be 16 or greater, the Government will file a motion
requesting an additional one level decreaseâ pursuant to Section 3E1.1(b) of the Sentencing
Guidelines, stating that the defendant has assisted authorities in the investigation or prosecution of
the defendantâs own misconduct by timely notifying authorities of the defendantâs intention to

{

-âentera plea of guilty, thereby permitting the Government to avoid preparing for trial and permitting
the Government and the Court to allocate their resources efficiently. The Government, however,
will not be required to make this motion and this recommendation if the defendant: (a) fails or
refuses to make a full, accurate and complete disclosure to the probation office of the
circumstances surrounding the relevant offense conduct; (b) is found to have misrepresented facts
to the Government prior to entering into this plea agreement; or (c) commits any misconduct after
entering into this plea agreement, including, but not limited to, committing a state or federal
offense, violating any term of release, or making false statements or misrepresentations to any
governmental entity or official.

8. The defendant agrees that he shall cooperate fully with the Government by: (a)
providing truthful and complete information and testimony, and producing documents, records and
other evidence, when called upon by the Government, whether in interviews, before a grand jury,
or at any trial or other Court proceeding; (b) appearing at such grand jury proceedings, hearings,
trials, and other judicial proceedings, and at meetings, as may be required by the Government; and
(c) if requested by the Government, working in an undercover role under the supervision of, and
in compliance with, law enforcement officers and agents. In addition, the defendant agrees that
he will not protect any person or entity through false information or omission, that he will not
falsely implicate any person-or entity, and that he that he will not commit any further crimes.

9. The Government reserves the right to evaluate the nature and extent of the
defendantâs cooperation and to make that cooperation, or lack thereof, known to the Court at the
time of sentencing. If in the sole and unreviewable judgment of the Government, the defendantâs
cooperation is of such quality and significance to the investigation or prosecution of other criminal

matters as to warrant the Courtâs downward departure from the advisory sentencing range

calculated under the Sentencing Guidelines and/or any applicable minimum mandatory sentence,
the Government may make a motion prior to sentencing pursuant to Section 5K1.1 of the
Sentencing Guidelines and/or Title 18, United States Code, Section 3553(e), or subsequent to
sentencing pursuant to Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, informing the Court
that the defendant has provided substantial assistance and recommending that the defendantâs
sentence be reduced. The defendant understands and agrees, however, that nothing in this
agreement requires the: Government to file any such motions, and that the Governmentâs
assessment of the quality and significance of the defendantâs cooperation shall be binding as it
relates to the appropriateness of the Governmentâs filing or non-filing of a motion to reduce
sentence. |

10. The defendant understands and acknowledges that the Court is under no obligation
to grant a motion for reduction of sentence filed by the Government. In addition, the defendant
further understands and acknowledges that the Court is under no obligation of any type to reduce
the defendantâs sentence because of the defendantâs cooperation.

11. The defendant agrees to forfeit to the United States voluntarily and immediately-all
property, real or personal, which constitutes or is derived from proceeds traceable to the violation
of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1956(h) charged in the Information. The defendant
agrees to consent to the entry of orders of forfeiture for such property and for a money judgment
equal in value to the total amount of proceeds traceable to his offense of conviction. The
defendant admits and agrees that the conduct described in the Information and Factual Proffer
provides a sufficient factual and statutory basis for the forfeiture of the property sought by the

Government.
Case $:18-cr-80054-RLR Docurnent 14 Entered on FLSD Docket OG/23/2018 Page Gof 1h

- 12. The defendant agrees to waive any appeal of the forfeiture. The defendant waives
the requirements of Rules 32.2 and 43(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure regarding
notice of the forfeiture in the Information, announcement of the forfeiture at sentencing, and
incorporation of the forfeiture in the judgment. The defendant also waives any failure by the
Court to advise the defendant of any applicable forfeiture at the time the guilty plea is accepted as
required by Rule 11(b)(1)(J) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The defendant further
agrees to waive any applicable time limits for the initiation of administrative or judicial forfeiture
proceeding and/or further notification of any such forfeiture brought against the property sought
- for forfeiture. |

13. The defendant also agrees to assist the Government in all proceedings,
administrative or judicial, involving forfeiture to the United States of any property, including
substitute property, regardless of its nature or form, real or personal, which the defendant or others
- known to the defendant, have accumulated as a result of illegal activities. The defendant agrees
that the United States shall, at its option, be entitled to forfeiture of any property (substitute assets)
of the defendant to satisfy the money judgment. The defendant further agrees to take all steps
necessary to locate property that could be used to satisfy the forfeiture money judgment and to
pass title to the United States before the defendantâs sentencing. To that end, the defendant agrees
to fully assist the Government in the recovery and return to the United States of any assets, or
portions thereof, wherever located. The assistance shall include: identification of any property
subject to forfeiture, agreement to the entry of an order enjoining the transfer or encumbrance of

such property, and the transfer of such property to the United States by delivery to the Government,

upon the Governmentâs request, any necessary and appropriate documentation, including consents .

to forfeiture and quit claim deeds, to deliver good and marketable title to such property. The

6

=~

(

defendant knowingly and voluntarily agrees to waive any claim or defense the defendant may have .
under the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution, including any claim of excessive
fine or penalty with respect to the forfeited assets.

14. The defendant further understands that forfeiture is independent of any
assessments, fines, costs, restitution, or any other penalty that may be imposed by the Court. The
defendant knowingly and voluntarily waives any claim or defense he may have under the Eighth
Amendment to the United States Constitution, including any claim of excessive fine or penalty
with respect to the forfeited property. |

15. The defendant agrees to make full and accurate disclosure of his financial affairs to
the Government, and expressly authorizes the Government to obtain a credit report. The
defendant agrees that within 10 calendar days of his change of plea and upon request of the
Government. the defendant shall submit a completed Financial Disclosure Statement (form
provided by the United States), and shall fully disclose and identify all assets in which he has any
interest and/or over which the defendant exercises control, directly or indirectly, including those
held by a spouse, nominee, or other third party. .

16. The defendant is aware that Title 18, United States Code, Section 3742 and Title
28, United States Code, Section 1291 afford the defendant the right to appeal the sentence imposed
in this case. Acknowledging this, in exchange for the undertakings made by the Government in
this plea agreement, the defendant hereby waives all rights conferred by Sections 3742 and 1291
to appeal any sentence imposed, including any restitution order, or to appeal the manner in which
the sentence was imposed, unless the sentence exceeds the maximum permitted by statute or is the
result of an upward departure and/or an upward variance from the advisory guideline range that
the Court establishes at sentencing. The defendant further understands that nothing in this

7
Case 9:18-cr-80084-RLR Document 14 Eritered on FLSD Docket O3/ea/2018 Page 8 of 11

agreement shall affect the Governmentâs right and/or duty to appeal as set forth in Title 18, United
States Code, Section 3742(b) and Title 28, United States Code, Section 1291. However, if the
Government appeals the defendantâs sentence pursuant to Sections 3742(b) and 1291, the
defendant shall be released from the above waiver of appellate rights. In addition, the defendant
âexpressly waives any argument that (1) the statute(s) to which the defendant is pleading guilty is
unconstitutional and (2) the admitted conduct does not fall within the scope of the statute(s). By
signing this agreement, the defendant acknowledges that the defendant has discussed the appeal
waiver set forth in this agreement with the defendantâs attorney.

17. The defendant is aware that the sentence has not yet been determined by the Court.
The defendant also is aware that any estimate of the probable sentencing range or sentence that the
defendant may receive, whether that estimate comes from the defendantâs attorney, the
Government, or the probation office, is a prediction, not a promise, and is not binding on the
Government, the probation office, or the Court. The defendant understands further that any
recommendation that the Goverment makes to the Court as to sentencing, whether pursuant to
this agreement or otherwise, is not binding on the Court and the Court may disregard the -
recommendation in its entirety. The defendant understands and acknowledges, as previously
acknowledged in paragraph three above, that the defendant may not withdraw his plea based upon
the Courtâs decision not to accept a sentencing recommendation made by the defendant, the
Government, or a recommendation made jointly by the defendant and the Government.

18. The defendant recognizes that pleading guilty may have consequences with respect
to the defendantâs immigration status if the defendant is not:a citizen of the United States. Under
federal law, a broad range of crimes are removable offenses, including the offense to which the
defendant is pleading guilty. Removal and other immigration consequences are the subject of a

8
Case $:18-cr-80054-RLR Document 24 Eriterect on FLSD Docket OS/2s/2018 Page Sof il

separate proceeding, however, and the defendant understands that no one, including the
defendantâs attorney or the Court, can predict to a certainty the effect of the defendantâs conviction
on the defendantâs immigration status. The defendant nevertheless affirms that the defendant
wants to plead guilty regardless of any immigration consequences that the defendantâs plea may
entail, even if the consequence is the defendantâs automatic removal from the United States.

19. | The Government and the defendant stipulate to and agree not to contest the facts in
the Factual Proffer, and stipulate that such facts, in accordance with Rule 11(b)(3) of the Federal
Rules of Criminal Procedure, provide a sufficient factual basis for the plea of guilty in this case.
The defendant agrees that the facts in the Factual Proffer are true and correct to the best of the
defendantâs knowledge. Because the factual basis set forth in the Factual Proffer has the limited
purpose of supporting the defendantâs guilty plea to the charge discussed in paragraph two, the
factual basis set forth in the Factual Proffer does not purport to represent all facts and
circumstances relating to the defendantâs participation. Similarly, the factual basis in the Factual
Proffer is not intended to identify all knowledge the defendant might have of the unlawful activity
of other individuals.

20. In the event the defendant withdraws from this agreement prior to or after pleading
guilty to the charge identified in paragraph two above, or should the Government, in its sole .
discretion, determine that the defendant has failed to fully comply with any of the terms of this
plea agreement, the Government will be released from its obligations under this agreement, and
the defendant agrees and understands that:

(a) the defendant thereby waives any protection afforded by any proffer letter agreement
between the parties, Section 1B1.8 of the Sentencing Guidelines, Rule 11(f) of the Federal Rules
of Criminal Procedure, and Rule 410 of the Federal Rules of Evidence;

9
Case 9:18-cr-80054-RLR Documentid Entered on FLSD Docket O3/23/2018 Page 10 of 11

(b) that any statements made by the defendant as part of the plea discussions, any
debriefings or interviews, or in this agreement, whether made prior to or after the execution of this
agreement, will âbe admissible against him without any limitation in any civil or criminal
proceeding brought by the Government;

| (c) the defendantâs waiver of any defense based on the statute of limitations and venue,
including the waiver set forth in this agreement, or any defense based on the passage of time in
filing an Indictment or Information, referred to herein, shall remain in full force and effect:

(d) the defendant stipulates to the admissibility and authenticity, in any case brought by the
United States inâ any way related to the facts referred to in this agreement, of any documents
provided by the defendant or the defendantâs representatives to any state of federal agency and/or
the Government; and

(e) the defendant has adopted the entire factual basis as the defendantâs statements, and the
defendant has stipulated to the admissibility of the Factual Proffer in any case brought by the
United States.

21. This is the entire agreement and understanding between the Government and the

defendant. There are no other agreements, promises, representations, or understandings.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Tuesday, November 20, 2018

Venezuelan Billionaire News Network Owner, Former Venezuelan National Treasurer and Former
Owner of Dominican Republic Bank Charged in Money Laundering Conspiracy Involving Over $1
Billion in Bribes

A Venezuelan billionaire who owns Globovision news network was charged in an indictment unsealed yesterday for his role in a billion-dollar
currency exchange and money laundering scheme. A former Venezuelan national treasurer and a former owner of Banco Peravia bank in the
Dominican Republic each pleaded guilty in proceedings unsealed today for their roles in the scheme.

Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Ariana Fajardo Orshan of the
Southern District of Florida, Special Agent in Charge Mark Selby of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcementâs Homeland Security
Investigations (HSI) Miami Field Office, Special Agent in Charge Mark B. Dawson of HSI Houston Field Office, Special Agent in Charge George L.
Piro of the FBI Miami Field Office, Special Agent in Charge Peter C. Fitzhugh and Inspector General Jay N. Lerner of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporationâs (FDIC) Washington, D.C. Office made the announcement.

Raul Gorrin Belisario (Gorrin), 50, a Venezuelan citizen with a residence in Miami, Florida, was charged in an indictment filed on Aug. 16, 2018 in
the Southern District of Florida with one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), one count of conspiracy to
commit money laundering and nine counts of money laundering. The case has been assigned to U.S. District Judge William P. Dimitrouleas of
the Southern District of Florida. Alejandro Andrade Cedeno (Andrade), 54, a Venezuelan citizen residing in Wellington, Florida and a former
Venezuelan national treasurer, pleaded guilty under seal on Dec. 22, 2017 before U.S. District Judge Robin L. Rosenberg of the Southern District
of Florida to one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. Gabriel Arturo Jimenez Aray (Jimenez), 50, a Venezuelan citizen residing in
Chicago, Illinois and former owner of Banco Peravia bank, pleaded guilty under seal on March 20, 2018 in the Southern District of Florida before
Judge Rosenberg to one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. Charges against Andrade and Jimenez were unsealed today.

The indictment alleges that Gorrin paid millions of dollars in bribes to two high-level Venezuelan officials, including Andrade, to secure the rights
to conduct foreign currency exchange transactions at favorable rates for the Venezuelan government. In addition to wiring money to and for
the officials, Gorrin allegedly purchased and paid expenses for them related to private jets, yachts, homes, champion horses, high-end watches
and a fashion line. To conceal the bribe payments, Gorrin made payments through multiple shell companies. Gorrin allegedly partnered with
Jimenez to acquire Banco Peravia, a bank in the Dominican Republic, to launder bribes paid to Venezuelan officials and proceeds of the

scheme.

As part of his guilty plea, Andrade admitted that he received over $1 billion in bribes from Gorrin and other co-conspirators in exchange for
using his position as Venezuelan national treasurer to select them to conduct currency exchange transactions for the Venezuelan government.
As part of his plea agreement, Andrade agreed to a forfeiture money judgment of $1 billion and forfeiture of all assets involved in the corrupt
scheme, including real estate, vehicles, horses, watches, aircraft and bank accounts. His sentencing is scheduled for Nov. 27.

As part of his guilty plea, Jimenez admitted that, as part of the scheme, he conspired with Gorrin and others to acquire Banco Peravia, through
which he helped launder bribe money and scheme proceeds. His sentencing is scheduled for Nov. 29.

HSI Miami, HSI Houston, HSI Boston, FBI Miami, and the FDIC D.C. investigated this case. This case is being prosecuted by Trial Attorneys
Vanessa Sisti Snyder, Paul A. Hayden and John-Alex Romano of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Michael B.
Nadler and Nalina Sombuntham of the Southern District of Floridaâs Criminal Division. The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs
provided significant assistance in this matter. The Policia Nacional (Spanish National Police) also provided significant assistance.

The Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the departmentâs FCPA

enforcement efforts can be found at www. justice. gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.

The charges in the indictment are merely allegations, and the defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in
a court of law.

DEFERRED PROSECUTION AGREEMENT

The defendant The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (the âCompanyâ), pursuant to authority
granted by the Companyâs Board of Directors, reflected in Attachment B, and the United States
Department of Justice, Criminal Division, Fraud Section and Money Laundering and Asset
Recovery Section, and the United States Attorneyâs Office for the Eastern District of New York
(collectively the âOfficesâ), enter into this deferred prosecution agreement (the âAgreementâ.

Criminal Information and Acceptance of Responsibility

1. The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Offices will file the attached one-
count criminal information (the âInformationâ) in the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of New York charging the Company with one count of conspiracy to commit offenses
against the United States, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 371, that is, to
violate the anti-bribery provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (âFCPAâ), as

amended, see Title 15, United States Code, Sections 78dd-1, 78dd-2 and 78dd-3. In so doing, the
Company: (a) knowingly waives its right to indictment on these charges, as well as all rights to a
speedy trial pursuant to the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, Title 18, United
States Code, Section 3161, and Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 48(b); and (b) knowingly
waives any objection with respect to venue to any charges by the United States arising out of the
conduct described in the Statement of Facts attached hereto as Attachment A (the âStatement of
Factsâ) and consents to the filing of the Information, as provided under the terms of this
Agreement, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The Offices
agree to defer prosecution of the Company pursuant to the terms and conditions described below.

2. The Company admits, accepts, and acknowledges that it is responsible under United
States law for the acts of its officers, directors, employees, and agents as charged in the
Information, and as set forth in the Statement of Facts, and that the allegations described in the
Information and the facts described in the Statement of Facts are true and accurate. Should the
Offices pursue the prosecution that is deferred by this Agreement, the Company stipulates to the
admissibility of the Statement of Facts in any proceeding by the Offices, including any trial, guilty
plea, or sentencing proceeding, and will not contradict anything in the Statement of Facts at any
such proceeding. The Company agrees that, effective as of the date the Company signs this
Agreement, in any prosecution that is deferred by this Agreement, it will not dispute the Statement
of Facts set forth in this Agreement, and, in any such prosecution, the Statement of Facts shall be
admissible as: (a) substantive evidence offered by the government in its case-in-chief and rebuttal
case; (b) impeachment evidence offered by the government on cross-examination; and (c) evidence
at any sentencing hearing or other hearing. In addition, in connection therewith, the Company

agrees not to assert any claim under the United States Constitution, Rule 410 of the Federal Rules

2
of Evidence, Rule 11(f) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, Section 1B1.1(a) of the United
States Sentencing Guidelines (âUSSGâ or âSentencing Guidelinesâ), or any other federal rule that
the Statement of Facts should be suppressed or is otherwise inadmissible as evidence in any form.
Term of the Agreement

3. This Agreement is effective for a period beginning on the date on which the
Information is filed and ending three (3) years from that date (the âTermââ). The Company agrees,
however, that, in the event the Offices determine, in their sole discretion, that the Company has
knowingly violated any provision of this Agreement or has failed to completely perform or fulfill
each of the Companyâs obligations under this Agreement, an extension or extensions of the Term
may be imposed by the Offices, in their sole discretion, for up to a total additional time period of
one year, without prejudice to the Officesâ right to proceed as provided in Paragraphs 17-20 below.
Any extension of the Agreement extends all terms of this Agreement, including the terms of the
reporting requirement in Attachment D (Corporate Compliance Reporting), for an equivalent
period. Conversely, in the event the Offices find, in their sole discretion, that there exists a change
in circumstances sufficient to eliminate the need for the reporting requirement in Attachment D,
and that the other provisions of this Agreement have been satisfied, the Agreement may be
terminated early. If the Court refuses to grant exclusion of time under the Speedy Trial Act, 18
U.S.C. Â§ 3161(h)(2), the Term shall be deemed to have not begun and all the provisions of the
Agreement shall be deemed null and void, except that the statute of limitations for any prosecution
relating to the conduct described in the Statement of Facts shall be tolled from the date on which
this Agreement was signed until the date the Court refuses to grant the exclusion of time plus six

months. In addition, if Goldman Sachs (Malaysia) Sdn. Bhd. (âGoldman Malaysiaâ) later is
permitted to withdraw its plea of guilty, this Agreement shall be deemed null and void, except that
the statute of limitations for any prosecution relating to the conduct described in the Statement of
Facts shall be tolled from the date on which this Agreement is signed until six months following
the date on which the plea of guilty is subsequently withdrawn.
Relevant Considerations
4, The Offices enter into this Agreement based on the individual facts and
circumstances presented by this case and the Company, including:

a. the Company did not receive voluntary disclosure credit pursuant to the
FCPA Corporate Enforcement Policy in the Department of Justice Manual (âJMâ) 9-47.120, or
pursuant to the Sentencing Guidelines, because it did not voluntarily and timely self-disclose to
the Offices the conduct described in the Statement of Facts;

b. the Company received partial credit for its cooperation with the Officesâ
investigation of the underlying conduct, including: collecting and producing voluminous evidence
located in other countries; making regular factual presentations and investigative updates to the
Offices; and voluntarily making foreign-based employees available for interviews in the United
States;

C. the Company did not receive full credit for its cooperation because the
Company was significantly delayed in producing relevant evidence, including recorded phone
calls in which the Companyâs bankers, executives, and control functions personnel discussed
allegations of bribery and misconduct relating to the conduct set forth in the Statement of Facts;

d. the Company ultimately provided to the Offices all relevant facts known to

it, including information about the individuals involved in the misconduct;

4
e. the Companyâs wholly-owned subsidiary, Goldman Malaysia, is pleading
guilty pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C) to one count of conspiracy to
commit offenses against the United States, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section
371, that is, to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA, as amended, Title 15, United States
Code, Sections 78dd-1 and 78dd-3;

f. the Company ultimately engaged in remedial measures, including (1)
implementing heightened controls and additional procedures and policies relating to electronic
surveillance and investigation, due diligence on proposed transactions or clients and the use of
third-party intermediaries across business units; and (11) enhancing anti-corruption training for all
management and relevant employees;

g. the Company has committed to continuing to enhance its compliance
program and internal controls, including ensuring that its compliance program satisfies the
minimum elements set forth in Attachment C to this Agreement (Corporate Compliance Program);

h. based on the Companyâs remediation and the state of its compliance
program, and the Companyâs agreement to report to the Offices as set forth in Attachment D, the
Offices determined that an independent compliance monitor is unnecessary;

1. the nature and seriousness of the offense conduct, including, among other
things: the amount of bribes; the level and number of the foreign officials bribed; the duration of
the scheme; the resulting illicit gains to and increased stature in the region for the Company from
the deals, which were significant to the Company and key to the divisions of the Company in

which the deals occurred;
j. the pervasiveness of the misconduct within the Company, including that
high-level employees within the Companyâs investment bank were involved in the misconduct
described in the Statement of Facts and others ignored significant red flags;

k. the Company has agreed, concurrent with this resolution, to resolve
additional investigations relating to the conduct described in the Statement of Facts, including by
entering into a Consent Order with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the
âthe Fedâ) pursuant to which it will pay a civil money penalty of $154 million; by settling an
Administrative Action filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the âSECâ) and
agreeing to pay $606 million in disgorgement and a civil monetary penalty of $400 million; by
entering into a Consent Order with the New York State Department of Financial Services (the
âDFSâ) pursuant to which it will agree to pay a civil money penalty of $150 million; by resolving
the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authorityâs and Prudential Regulation Authorityâs (the
âUK FCA and PRAâ) investigations and paying a civil penalty to each of $63 million (for a total
of $126 million); by resolving the investigation by the Attorney-Generalâs Chambers of the
Republic of Singapore (the âSingapore AGCâ) pursuant to which it will pay $122 million; by
resolving the investigation of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (the âSingapore MASâ); by
resolving with the Commercial Affairs Department of the Singapore Police Force (the âSingapore
CADâ); and by resolving the investigation by the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission
(the âHong Kong SFCâ) pursuant to which it will pay $350 million;

I. the Company has no prior criminal history; and

m. the Company has agreed to continue to cooperate with the Officesâ ongoing

investigation of individuals and other entities, including as described in Paragraph 5 below.
n. Accordingly, after considering (a) through (m) above, the Offices believe
that the appropriate resolution in this case is a deferred prosecution agreement with the Company;
a criminal monetary penalty of $2,315,088,000, which reflects an aggregate discount of ten (10)
percent off of the bottom of the otherwise-applicable Sentencing Guidelines fine range for the
FCPA conduct; disgorgement of $606 million; and a guilty plea by Goldman Malaysia.

Future Cooperation and Disclosure Requirements

5. The Company shall cooperate fully with the Offices in any and all matters relating
to the conduct described in this Agreement and the Statement of Facts and other conduct under
investigation by the Offices at any time during the Term, subject to applicable laws and
regulations, until the later of the date upon which all investigations and prosecutions arising out of
such conduct are concluded, or the end of the Term. At the request of the Offices, the Company
shall also cooperate fully with other domestic or foreign law enforcement and regulatory
authorities and agencies, as well as the Multilateral Development Banks (âMDBsâ), in any
investigation of the Company, its branches, representative offices, subsidiaries or its affiliates, or
any of its present or former officers, directors, employees, agents, and consultants, or any other
party, in any and all matters relating to the conduct described in this Agreement and the Statement
of Facts. The Companyâs cooperation pursuant to this Paragraph is subject to applicable laws and
regulations, including relevant data privacy and national security laws and regulations, as well as
valid claims of attorney-client privilege or attorney work product doctrine; however, the Company
must provide to the Offices a log of any information or cooperation that is not provided based on

an assertion of law, regulation, or privilege, and the Company bears the burden of establishing the
validity of any such assertion. The Company agrees that its cooperation pursuant to this Paragraph
shall include, but not be limited to, the following:

a. The Company shall truthfully disclose all factual information with respect
to its activities, those of its branches, representative offices, subsidiaries and affiliates, and those
of its present and former directors, officers, employees, agents, and consultants, including any
evidence or allegations and internal or external investigations, about which the Company has any
knowledge or about which the Offices may inquire. This obligation of truthful disclosure includes,
but is not limited to, the obligation of the Company to provide to the Offices, upon request, any
document, record, or other tangible evidence about which the Offices may inquire of the Company.

b. Upon request of the Offices, the Company shall designate knowledgeable
employees, agents, or attorneys to provide to the Offices the information and materials described
in Paragraph 5(a) above on behalf of the Company. It is further understood that the Company
must at all times provide complete, truthful, and accurate information.

C. The Company shall use its best efforts to make available for interviews or
testimony, as requested by the Offices, present or former officers, directors, employees, agents and
consultants of the Company. This obligation includes, but is not limited to, sworn testimony before
a federal grand jury, in federal trials or at any other proceeding, all meetings requested by the
Offices, and interviews with domestic or foreign law enforcement and regulatory authorities.
Cooperation under this Paragraph shall include identification of witnesses who, to the knowledge
of the Company, may have material information regarding the matters being investigated or

prosecuted.
d. With respect to any information, testimony, documents, records, or other
tangible evidence provided to the Offices pursuant to this Agreement, the Company consents to
any and all disclosures, subject to applicable laws and regulations, to other governmental
authorities, including United States authorities and those of a foreign government, as well as the
MDBs, of such materials as the Offices, in their sole discretion, shall deem appropriate.

6. In addition to the obligations in Paragraph 5, during the Term, should the Company
learn of any evidence or allegation of conduct that may constitute a violation of the money
laundering laws that involve the employees or agents of the Company, or should the Company
learn of any evidence or allegation of conduct that may constitute a violation of the FCPAâs anti-
bribery or accounting provisions had the conduct occurred within the jurisdiction of the United
States, the Company shall promptly report such evidence or allegation to the Offices.

Payment of Monetary Penalty

7. The Offices and the Company agree that application of the Sentencing Guidelines

to determine the applicable fine range yields the following analysis:
a. The 2018 USSG are applicable to this matter.

b. Offense Level. Based upon USSG Â§ 2C1.1, the total offense level is 48, calculated

as follows:

(a)(2) Base Offense Level 12
(b)(1) Multiple Bribes +2
(b)(2) Value of benefit received more than $550,000,000 +30
(b)(3) High-Level Official Involved +4
TOTAL 48
c. Base Fine. Based upon USSG Â§ 8C2.4(a)(3), the base fine is $1,607,700,000 (value
of the unlawful payments, pursuant to Â§ 2C1.1(d)(1)).

d. Culpability Score. Based upon USSG Â§ 8C2.5, the culpability score is 8, calculated
as follows:

(a) Base Culpability Score 5
(b)(1) the organization had 5,000 or more employees and

an individual within high-level personnel of the
organization participated in, condoned, or was

willfully ignorant of the offense +5
(g)(2) Cooperation, Acceptance -2
TOTAL 8

e. Calculation of Fine Range:

 

Base Fine $1,607,700,000

Multipliers 1.6 (min)/3.2 (max)

Fine Range $2,572,320,000 to $5,144,640,000
8. The Offices and the Company agree, based on the application of the Sentencing

Guidelines to the misconduct, that the appropriate disgorgement is $606 million (the
âDisgorgement Amountâ) and the total monetary penalty is $2,315,088,000 (the âTotal Criminal
Penaltyâ), $500,000 of which will be paid as a criminal fine by Goldman Malaysia pursuant to its
plea agreement entered into simultaneously herewith. The Total Criminal Penalty reflects a ten
(10) percent discount off the bottom of the applicable U.S.S.G. fine range for the Companyâs
cooperation. The Company and the Offices further agree that the Company will pay the United

States $1,263,088,000, $500,000 of which will be paid as a criminal fine by Goldman Malaysia,

10
to the United States Treasury within ten business days of the sentencing hearing by the Court of
Goldman Malaysia in connection with its plea agreement entered into simultaneously herewith.
9. The Offices agree to credit the remaining amount of the Total Criminal Penalty
against the amount the Company pays to the SEC, Fed, DFS, UK FCA and PRA, Singapore AGC,
Singapore CAD and Hong Kong SFC. The Offices will credit the entire penalty amount that the
Company pays to the SEC, Fed, DFS, UK FCA and PRA, Singapore AGC and Singapore CAD,
as well as $100 million of the penalty the Company pays to Hong Kong SFC, in connection with
parallel resolutions entered into between the Company and those authorities. The Companyâs
payment obligations to the United States under the Agreement will be complete upon the total
payment of $1,263,088,000, so long as the Company pays the remaining amount of the Total
Criminal Penalty to the SEC, Fed, DFS, UK FCA and PRA, Singapore AGC and Hong Kong SFC,
by the end of one year from the beginning of the Term. Should any amount of such payments to
these authorities not be made by the end of one year from the beginning of the Term, or be returned
to the Company or any affiliated entity for any reason, the remaining balance of the Total Criminal
Penalty will be paid to the United States Treasury. The Offices further agree to credit the
Disgorgement Amount against any amount equal or greater to the Disgorgement Amount that the
Company pays to authorities in Malaysia in connection with the conduct detailed in the Statement
of Facts, if paid within one year from the beginning of the Term. Should the Company not pay
the full Disgorgement Amount to Malaysia by one year from the beginning of the Term, or should
all or a portion of the Disgorgement Amount be returned to the Company or any affiliated entity

for any reason, the remaining balance of the Disgorgement Amount will be paid to the United

1]
States Treasury, except that the Offices agree to credit any part of this amount that is paid to the
SEC as disgorgement.

10. The Company and the Offices agree that the Total Criminal Penalty and the
Disgorgement Amount are appropriate given the facts and circumstances of this case, including
the Relevant Considerations described in Paragraph 4 of this Agreement. The Total Criminal
Penalty is final and shall not be refunded. Furthermore, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed
an agreement by the Offices that the Total Criminal Penalty is the maximum penalty that may be
imposed in any future prosecution, and the Offices are not precluded from arguing in any future
prosecution that the Court should impose a higher fine, although the Offices agree that under those
circumstances, it will recommend to the Court that any amount paid under this Agreement should
be offset against any fine the Court imposes as part of a future judgment. The Company
acknowledges that no tax deduction may be sought in connection with the payment of any part of
the Total Criminal Penalty. The Company shall not seek or accept directly or indirectly
reimbursement or indemnification from any source with regard to the Total Criminal Penalty or
the Disgorgement Amount that the Company pays pursuant to this Agreement or any other
agreement entered into with an enforcement authority or regulator concerning the facts set forth in
the Statement of Facts.

Conditional Release from Liability

11. Subject to Paragraphs 17-20, the Offices agree, except as provided in this
Agreement and in the plea agreement between the Offices and Goldman Malaysia dated October
22, 2020, that they will not bring any criminal or civil case against the Company or any of its

branches, representative offices or direct or indirect affiliates, subsidiaries, or joint ventures,

12
relating to any of the conduct described in the Statement of Facts or the criminal Information filed
pursuant to this Agreement. The Offices, however, may use any information related to the conduct
described in the Statement of Facts against the Company: (a) in a prosecution for perjury or
obstruction of justice; (b) in a prosecution for making a false statement; (c) in a prosecution or
other proceeding relating to any crime of violence; or (d) in a prosecution or other proceeding
relating to a violation of any provision of Title 26 of the United States Code.

a. This Agreement does not provide any protection against prosecution for any
future conduct by the Company or any of its branches, representative offices or direct or indirect
affiliates, subsidiaries, or joint ventures.

b. In addition, this Agreement does not provide any protection against
prosecution of any individuals, regardless of their affiliation with the Company.

Corporate Compliance Program

12. The Company represents that it has implemented and will continue to implement a
compliance and ethics program designed to prevent and detect violations of the FCPA and other
applicable anti-corruption laws or money laundering laws throughout its operations, including
those of its branches, representative offices, subsidiaries, agents, and joint ventures, and those of
its contractors and subcontractors whose responsibilities include interacting with foreign officials
or other activities carrying a high risk of corruption, including, but not limited to, the minimum
elements set forth in Attachment C.

13. In order to address any deficiencies in its internal accounting controls, policies, and
procedures, the Company represents that it has undertaken, and will continue to undertake in the

future, in a manner consistent with all of its obligations under this Agreement, a review of its

13
existing internal accounting controls, policies, and procedures, regarding compliance with the
FCPA and other applicable anti-corruption laws. Where necessary and appropriate, the Company
agrees to modify or maintain its existing compliance program, including internal controls,
compliance policies, and procedures in order to ensure that it maintains: (a) an effective system of
internal accounting controls designed to ensure the making and keeping of fair and accurate books,
records, and accounts; and (b) a rigorous anti-corruption compliance program that incorporates
relevant internal accounting controls, as well as policies and procedures designed to effectively
detect and deter violations of the FCPA and other applicable anti-corruption laws. The compliance
program, including the internal accounting controls system, will include, but not be limited to, the
minimum elements set forth in Attachment C.
Corporate Compliance Reporting

14. The Company agrees that it will report to the Offices annually during the Term
regarding remediation and implementation of the compliance measures described in Attachment
C. These reports will be prepared in accordance with Attachment D.

Deferred Prosecution

15. In consideration of the undertakings agreed to by the Company herein, the Offices
agree that any prosecution of the Company for the conduct set forth in the Statement of Facts be
and hereby is deferred for the Term, except as provided in the plea agreement between the Offices
and Goldman Malaysia, dated October 22, 2020. To the extent there is conduct disclosed by the
Company that is not set forth in the Statement of Facts, such conduct will not be exempt from

further prosecution and is not within the scope of or relevant to this Agreement.

14
16. The Offices further agree that if the Company fully complies with all of its
obligations under this Agreement, the Offices will not continue the criminal prosecution against
the Company described in Paragraph 1 and, at the conclusion of the Term, this Agreement shall
expire. Within six months of the Agreementâs expiration, the Offices shall seek dismissal with
prejudice of the criminal Information filed against the Company described in Paragraph 1, and
agree not to file charges in the future against the Company based on the conduct described in this
Agreement and the Statement of Facts. If, however, the Offices determine during this six-month
period that the Company breached the Agreement during the Term, as described in Paragraph 17,
the Officesâ ability to extend the Term, as described in Paragraph 3, or to pursue other remedies,
including those described in Paragraphs 17-20, remains in full effect.

Breach of the Agreement

17. If, during the Term, the Company (a) commits any felony under U.S. federal law;
(b) provides in connection with this Agreement deliberately false, incomplete, or misleading
information, including in connection with its disclosure of information about individual
culpability; (c) fails to cooperate as set forth in Paragraphs 5 and 6 of this Agreement; (d) fails to
implement a compliance program as set forth in Paragraphs 12 and 13 of this Agreement and
Attachment C; (e) commits any act that, had it occurred within the jurisdictional reach of the
FCPA, would be a violation of the FCPA; or (f) otherwise fails to completely perform or fulfill
each of the Companyâs obligations under the Agreement, regardless of whether the Offices become
aware of such a breach after the Term is complete, the Company shall thereafter be subject to
prosecution for any federal criminal violation of which the Offices have knowledge, including, but

not limited to, the charges in the Information described in Paragraph 1, which may be pursued by

15
the Offices in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York or any other appropriate
venue. Determination of whether the Company has breached the Agreement and whether to pursue
prosecution of the Company shall be in the Officesâ sole discretion. Any such prosecution may be
premised on information provided by the Company or its personnel. Any such prosecution relating
to the conduct described in the Statement of Facts or relating to conduct known to the Offices prior
to the date on which this Agreement was signed that is not time-barred by the applicable statute of
limitations on the date of the signing of this Agreement may be commenced against the Company,
notwithstanding the expiration of the statute of limitations, between the signing of this Agreement
and the expiration of the Term plus one year. Thus, by signing this Agreement, the Company
agrees that the statute of limitations with respect to any such prosecution that is not time-barred on
the date of the signing of this Agreement shall be tolled for the Term plus one year. In addition,
the Company agrees that the statute of limitations as to any violation of federal law that occurs
during the Term will be tolled from the date upon which the violation occurs until the earlier of
the date upon which the Offices are made aware of the violation or the duration of the Term plus
five years, and that this period shall be excluded from any calculation of time for purposes of the
application of the statute of limitations.

18. In the event the Offices determine that the Company has breached this Agreement,
the Offices agree to provide the Company with written notice of such breach prior to instituting
any prosecution resulting from such breach. Within thirty days of receipt of such notice, the
Company shall have the opportunity to respond to the Offices in writing to explain the nature and

circumstances of such breach, as well as the actions the Company has taken to address and

16
remediate the situation, which explanation the Offices shall consider in determining whether to
pursue prosecution of the Company.

19. In the event that the Offices determine that the Company has breached this
Agreement: (a) all statements made by or on behalf of the Company to the Offices or to the Court,
including the Statement of Facts, and any testimony given by the Company before a grand jury, a
court, or any tribunal, or at any legislative hearings, whether prior or subsequent to this Agreement,
and any leads derived from such statements or testimony, shall be admissible in evidence in any
and all criminal proceedings brought by the Offices against the Company; and (b) the Company
shall not assert any claim under the United States Constitution, Rule 11(f) of the Federal Rules of
Criminal Procedure, Rule 410 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, or any other federal rule that any
such statements or testimony made by or on behalf of the Company prior or subsequent to this
Agreement, or any leads derived therefrom, should be suppressed or are otherwise
inadmissible. The decision whether conduct or statements of any current director, officer, or
employee, or any person acting on behalf of, or at the direction of, the Company, will be imputed
to the Company for the purpose of determining whether the Company has violated any provision
of this Agreement shall be in the sole discretion of the Offices.

20. The Company acknowledges that the Offices have made no representations,
assurances, or promises concerning what sentence may be imposed by the Court if the Company
breaches this Agreement and this matter proceeds to judgment. The Company further
acknowledges that any such sentence is solely within the discretion of the Court and that nothing

in this Agreement binds or restricts the Court in the exercise of such discretion.

17
21. On the date that the period of deferred prosecution specified in this Agreement
expires, the Company, by the Chief Executive Officer of the Company and the Chief Financial
Officer of the Company, will certify, in the form of executing the document attached as Attachment
E to this Agreement, to the Offices that the Company has met its disclosure obligations pursuant
to Paragraph 6 of this Agreement. Each certification will be deemed a material statement and
representation by the Company to the executive branch of the United States for purposes of 18
U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1001 and 1519, and it will be deemed to have been made in the judicial district in which
this Agreement is filed.

Sale, Merger, or Other Change in Corporate Form of Company

22. Except as may otherwise be agreed by the parties in connection with a particular
transaction, the Company agrees that in the event that, during the Term, it undertakes any change
in corporate form, including if it sells, merges, or transfers business operations that are material to
the Companyâs consolidated operations, or to the operations of any branches, representative
offices, subsidiaries or affiliates involved in the conduct described in the Statement of Facts, as
they exist as of the date of this Agreement, whether such sale is structured as a sale, asset sale,
merger, transfer, or other change in corporate form, it shall include in any contract for sale, merger,
transfer, or other change in corporate form a provision binding the purchaser, or any successor in
interest thereto, to the obligations described in this Agreement. The purchaser or successor in
interest must also agree in writing that the Officesâ ability to declare a breach under this Agreement
is applicable in full force to that entity. The Company agrees that the failure to include these
provisions in the transaction will make any such transaction null and void. The Company shall

provide notice to the Offices at least thirty days prior to undertaking any such sale, merger, transfer,

18
or other change in corporate form. The Offices shall notify the Company prior to such transaction
(or series of transactions) if they determine that the transaction(s) will have the effect of
circumventing or frustrating the enforcement purposes of this Agreement. At any time during the
Term the Company engages in a transaction(s) that has the effect of circumventing or frustrating
the enforcement purposes of this Agreement, the Offices may deem it a breach of this Agreement
pursuant to Paragraphs 17-20 of this Agreement. Nothing herein shall restrict the Company from
indemnifying (or otherwise holding harmless) the purchaser or successor in interest for penalties
or other costs arising from any conduct that may have occurred prior to the date of the transaction,
so long as such indemnification does not have the effect of circumventing or frustrating the
enforcement purposes of this Agreement, as determined by the Offices.

Public Statements by Company

23. The Company expressly agrees that it shall not, through present or future attorneys,
officers, directors, employees, agents or any other person authorized to speak for the Company,
make any public statement, in litigation or otherwise, contradicting the acceptance of responsibility
by the Company set forth above or the facts described in the Statement of Facts. Any such
contradictory statement shall, subject to cure rights of the Company described below, constitute a
breach of this Agreement, and the Company thereafter shall be subject to prosecution as set forth
in Paragraphs 17-20 of this Agreement. The decision whether any public statement by any such
person contradicting a fact contained in the Statement of Facts will be imputed to the Company
for the purpose of determining whether it has breached this Agreement shall be at the sole
discretion of the Offices. If the Offices determine that a public statement by any such person

contradicts in whole or in part a statement contained in the Statement of Facts, the Offices shall so

19
notify the Company, and the Company may avoid a breach of this Agreement by publicly
repudiating such statement(s) within five business days after notification. The Company shall be
permitted to raise defenses and to assert affirmative claims in other proceedings relating to the
matters set forth in the Statement of Facts provided that such defenses and claims do not contradict,
in whole or in part, a statement contained in the Statement of Facts. This Paragraph does not apply
to any statement made by any present or former officer, director, employee, or agent of the
Company in the course of any criminal, regulatory, or civil case initiated against such individual,
unless such individual is speaking on behalf of the Company.

24. The Company agrees that if it or any of its branches, representatives or direct or
indirect subsidiaries, affiliates or joint ventures issues a press release or holds any press conference
in connection with this Agreement, the Company shall first consult with the Offices to determine
(a) whether the text of the release or proposed statements at the press conference are true and
accurate with respect to matters between the Offices and the Company; and (b) whether the Offices
have any objection to the release or statement.

25. The Offices agree, if requested to do so, to bring to the attention of law
enforcement and regulatory authorities the facts and circumstances relating to the nature of the
conduct underlying this Agreement, including the nature and quality of the Companyâs cooperation
and remediation. By agreeing to provide this information to such authorities, the Offices are not
agreeing to advocate on behalf of the Company, but rather are agreeing to provide facts to be
evaluated independently by such authorities. Nothing in this Agreement restricts in any way the
ability of the Offices, any other federal department or agency, or any state or local government

from proceeding criminally, civilly, or administratively, against any current or former directors,

20
officers, employees or agents of the Company or against any other entities or individuals. The
parties to this Agreement intend that the Agreement does not confer or provide any benefits,
privileges, immunities or rights to any other individual or entity other than the parties hereto.
Limitations on Binding Effect of Agreement

26. This Agreement is binding on the Company and the Offices but specifically does
not bind any other component of the Department of Justice, other federal agencies, or any state,
local, or foreign law enforcement or regulatory agencies, or any other authorities, although the
Offices will bring the cooperation of the Company and its compliance with its other obligations
under this Agreement to the attention of such agencies and authorities if requested to do so by the
Company.

27. Any notice to the Offices under this Agreement shall be given by electronic mail

Agreement shall be valid unless they are in writing and signed by the Offices, the attorneys for the

Company, and a duly authorized representative of the Company.

ATTACHMENT A
STATEMENT OF FACTS

The following Statement of Facts is incorporated by reference as part of the
Deferred Prosecution Agreement (the âAgreementââ) between the United States Department of
Justice, Criminal Division, Fraud Section (the âFraud Sectionâ) and Money Laundering and
Asset Recovery Section (ââMLARSâ), and the United States Attorneyâs Office for the Eastern
District of New York (the âOfficeâââ) (collectively, the âUnited Statesâ), and the defendant, The
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries and affiliated entities,
âGoldmanâ or the âCompanyââ). Goldman hereby agrees and stipulates that the following facts
and conclusions of law are true and accurate. Certain of the facts herein are based on
information obtained from third parties by the United States through its investigation and
described to Goldman. Goldman admits, accepts, and acknowledges that it is responsible for the
acts of its officers, directors, employees and agents as set forth below. Should the United States
pursue the prosecution that is deferred by this Agreement, Goldman agrees that it will neither
contest the admissibility of, nor contradict, this Statement of Facts in any such proceeding. The
following facts took place during the relevant time period, unless otherwise noted, and establish
beyond a reasonable doubt the charges set forth in the criminal Information attached to the
Agreement.

The Defendant Goldman and Other Entities

1. From in or about and between 2009 and at least 2014 (the ârelevant time
periodâ), Goldman was a global investment banking, securities and investment management firm
incorporated in Delaware and headquartered in New York, New York. Accordingly, during the

relevant time period, Goldman was a âUnited States personâ as that term is used in the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act (ââFCPAâ), Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-1(g). Goldman had
a class of securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(Title 15, United States Code, Section 781) and was required to file periodic reports with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission (âSECâ). Accordingly, during the relevant time period,
Goldman was an âissuerâ as that term is used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section
78dd-1. Goldman operated worldwide primarily through wholly-owned subsidiaries and
affiliated entities. Goldman and its subsidiaries and affiliated entities, combined, had
approximately 38,000 employees.

2. Goldman Sachs (Malaysia) Sdn. Bhd. (âGoldman Malaysiaâ) was a
wholly-owned subsidiary and agent of Goldman. Goldman Malaysia was incorporated in
Malaysia and had offices in Kuala Lumpur. Goldman Malaysiaâs records and accounts were
included in Goldmanâs consolidated financial statements to the SEC. Goldman Malaysia also
received revenue related to the relevant transactions described more fully below. During the
relevant time period, Goldman Malaysia and its employees and directors were agents of an
âissuer as that term is used in the FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-1.

3. Goldman Sachs (Singapore) Pte., Goldman Sachs International, Goldman
Sachs Bank USA, Goldman Sachs & Co. L.L.C. and Goldman Sachs (Asia) L.L.C. are each
Goldman subsidiaries, and they and their employees were agents of Goldman that assisted in
carrying out business around the world, including the relevant transactions and conduct set forth
herein. During the relevant time period, Goldman Sachs (Asia) L.L.C. was incorporated in
Delaware, had offices in Hong Kong and was a âdomestic concernâ as that term is used in the
FCPA, Title 15, United States Code, Section 78dd-2, and a âUnited States personâ as that term is

The Criminal Scheme
Overview

23. In or about and between 2009 and 2014, Goldman, through certain of its
agents and employees, together with others, knowingly and willfully conspired and agreed with
others to corruptly provide payments and things of value to, or for the benefit of, foreign officials
and their relatives to induce those foreign officials to influence the decisions of IMDB, IPIC and
Aabar to obtain and retain business for Goldman, including positions as an advisor to IMDB on
the acquisitions of Malaysian energy assets, underwriter of the IMDB bonds, and underwriter of
certain other IMDB business, including the contemplated initial public offering (âIPOââ) of
1MDBâs Malaysian energy assets. Leissner, Ng and Employee | used Lowâs connections within
the Governments of Malaysia and Abu Dhabi to obtain and retain this and other business for
Goldman and, in turn, concealed Lowâs involvement in the deals from certain employees and
agents of Goldman. In total, Goldman conspired to provide approximately $1.6077 billion to, or
for the benefit of, foreign officials and their relatives, of which approximately $18.1 million was
paid from accounts controlled by Leissner.

24. The bribes resulted in Goldman being engaged on, among other projects,
three bond offerings that were related to 1MDBâs energy acquisitions and that raised a total of
approximately $6.5 billion for IMDB in 2012 and 2013. The bribes were also intended to help

Goldman secure a role on the anticipated IPO of those energy assets. These three bond offerings
and a related acquisition, along with a transaction involving Low and IPIC,! ultimately earned
Goldman in excess of $600 million in fees and revenue across its divisions, and increased
Goldmanâs stature in Southeast Asia. In the course of this scheme, payments and
communications made in furtherance of the scheme were made via wires that passed through the
Eastern District of New York.

25. Pursuant to Goldmanâs internal accounting controls, each IMDB bond
transaction required Goldman managementâs general and specific authorization. Moreover,
because Goldman initially purchased the full value of each bond from IMDB using Goldmanâs
assets, the transactions needed to be appropriately authorized and properly recorded. Among
other things, Goldmanâs internal accounting controls included the Firmwide Capital Committee
(âFWCCââ), which was authorized by Goldmanâs Chief Executive Officer to provide global
oversight and approval of bond transactions, including those transactions in which Goldman used
its own assets to purchase the financial instruments, like the IMDB bonds. Goldmanâs internal
accounting controls also included approval of the bonds by Goldmanâs Business Intelligence
Group (âBIGâ) and compliance, both of which were represented on the FWCC. While certain of
Goldmanâs employees and agents, including Leissner, Ng and Employee 1, circumvented these
and other controls, other Goldman employees and agents who were responsible for implementing
its internal accounting controls failed to do so in connection with the IMDB bond deals.
Specifically, although employees serving as part of Goldmanâs control functions knew that any
transaction involving Low posed a significant risk, and although they were on notice that he was
involved in the transactions, they did not take reasonable steps to ensure that Low was not

involved. Additionally, there were significant red flags raised during the due diligence process

 

' This transaction involved Leissner, Employee 1, Low and IPIC, and Lowâs monetary
contribution to this deal involved funds misappropriated from the bond offerings.

9
and afterward, including, but not limited to, Lowâs involvement in the deals, that were either
ignored or only nominally addressed so that the transactions would be approved and Goldman
could continue to do business with IMDB.

Goldmanâs Relationship with Low

26. In or about 2009, Leissner and Ng were introduced to Low, who was
known to be close to various high-ranking officials in Malaysia and Abu Dhabi, and through
Low began cultivating relationships with Malaysian Official 1 and others to secure business for
Goldman.

27. In or about January 2009, Leissner and Ng discussed with Low and others
a role for Goldman in the creation of and potential fundraising for Terengganu Investment
Authority (âTIAâ), IMDBâs predecessor entity.

28. Leissner and Ng also attempted to onboard Low as a Goldman client, or
otherwise work with Low, on numerous occasions in or about and between 2009 and 2013. For
example, in or about September 2009, Ng referred Low for a private wealth management account
(âPWMâ) through a Goldman European subsidiary. Ng described Low as âour partner in a lot of
transactions in [M]alaysia. Largely the mid-east and [M]alaysia rationship [sic]. As part of the
onboarding process, Goldmanâs control functions, including BIG, vetted Lowâs finances and
raised questions about his source of wealth. As control functions personnel worked to diligence
those questions about Low, the business side continued to pressure them to approve Low as a
client. In a March 13, 2010 email, a Goldman regional head of compliance wrote to a high-level
BIG executive and others, expressing frustration with the pressure to approve Low and
underscoring the red flags Low raised as a client:

This has been an exceptionally trying experience I have to admit, and I believe that
no matter what we do [Goldman PWM representative] is not willing to accept that

10
we are not in a position to onboard this prospect .. . I do not believe we will ever
be able to get comfortable with this matter. Iâd like to shut this down once and for
all... Itis seldom that one sees a vendor report, which has been backed up verbally
by them, that so clearly states that we should exercise extreme caution.

29. Ultimately, BIG personnel rejected Low as a Goldman client because of
his inability to satisfactorily answer questions raised by Goldmanâs control functions, as well as
negative news coverage about Lowâs lavish spending. Notwithstanding this rejection, there were
additional attempts to onboard Low and his companies as a Goldman client.

30. For example, in early 2011, Leissner tried to onboard two of Lowâs
companies as clients of Goldman but was unable to do so due to complianceâs continued
objections to Low.

31. Around the same time, Leissner made an additional attempt to bring Low
on as a PWM client through Goldmanâs Singapore office, without referencing the prior attempt.
Low was again denied due to, among other things, his questionable source of wealth. In a March
11, 2011 email chain discussing the attempt, a high-ranking employee in compliance and MD
noted, âTo be clear, we have pretty much zero appetite for a relationship with this individual,â
and a high-ranking employee in BIG and MD expressed, âthis is a name to be avoided.â

32. Even after the control functions had rejected Low as a client, Leissner, Ng
and others at Goldman continued their relationship with Low and used him to obtain and retain
business for Goldman from 1MDB and others. In or about and between 2012 and 2013,
Leissner, Ng, Employee | and other Goldman employees worked with Low to help IMDB raise

more than $6.5 billion via three separate bond offering transactions, referred to internally at

Goldman as âProject Magnolia,â âProject Maximusâ and âProject Catalyze,â respectively.

11
Project Magnolia

33. In or about February 2012, IMDB engaged Goldman as its financial
advisor for its anticipated purchase of a Malaysian energy company (âMalaysian Energy
Company Aâ). Low helped secure Goldmanâs role in that transaction.

34. On or about January 23, 2012, Low arranged a meeting between Leissner,
Ng and a high-ranking 1MDB official. In making the arrangements, Low emailed all three at
their personal email addresses, and stated âMaking an introduction to [Leissner] and [Ng]âs
private e-mail accounts [....] Please exclude me from the e-mail list going forward.â Thereafter,
Leissner and Ng worked with the high-ranking IMDB official on the potential purchase of
Malaysian Energy Company A.

35. 1MDB was also interested in raising funds to acquire Malaysian Energy
Company A, including through a bond transaction. In or about early 2012, Leissner, Ng, IMDB
Official 1, IMDB Official 3, Low and others met in Malaysia to discuss the necessity of a
guarantee from IPIC to make the bond transaction feasible for Goldman, which would purchase
all of the bonds initially, and then sell the bonds to other investors.

36. In or about February 2012, Leissner and Ng traveled to London to meet
with Low and others to discuss the proposed bond transaction. Leissner and Ng utilized
Goldman resources to fund their travel to London.

37. At that meeting, Low explained that government officials from Abu Dhabi
and Malaysia needed to be bribed to both obtain the guarantee from IPIC and get the necessary
approvals from Malaysia and IMDB. Low advised that a high-ranking official of IPIC (âIPIC

Official 1â) and Malaysian Official 1 needed to be paid the largest bribes out of all the

12
government officials to approve the transaction, and that other lower-level officials would need
to be bribed as well.

38. Subsequently, Leissner and Ng each separately informed Employee 1
about the information they had learned at the London meeting regarding the need to bribe foreign
officials.

39. Low also promised remuneration to various |1MDB officials to facilitate
the deals and to ensure Goldmanâs role in those deals. For example, on or about March 8, 2012,
IMDB Official 1 emailed himself a copy of an online chat he had with Low on or about March
8, 2012, in which they discussed, among other things, Malaysian Energy Company A. In that
chat, Low told IMDB Official 1 that he would give IMDB Official 1 a âbig presentâ when the
Malaysian Energy Company A transaction was completed and then directed IMDB Official 1 to
âdelete from email and destroy once done.â

AO. On or about March 5, 2012, Leissner, Ng, Employee 1, Low and others
traveled to Abu Dhabi to meet with IPIC and Aabar representatives regarding the potential debt
financing that would assist 1 MDB in raising funds for the acquisition of Malaysian Energy
Company A. During the same trip, Low arranged a meeting between Leissner and IPIC
Official 1, during which Leissner delivered a letter from Malaysian Official 1 addressed to IPIC
Official 1.

Al. On or about March 19, 2012, IMDB formally chose Goldman as the âsole
bookrunner and arrangerâ for the $1.75 billion debt financing transaction designed, in part, to
pay $822 million towards Malaysian Energy Company Aâs acquisition. IPIC was chosen to
serve as guarantor on the bond and Aabar was granted certain options by the 1MDB issuer for

assistance in securing the guarantee.

13
42. One of Goldmanâs goals in pursuing this transaction was to secure more
business for itself, including a role in the potential IPO of IMDBâs energy assets, as explicitly
stated in Goldmanâs FWCC memorandum circulated during the approval process for Project
Magnolia: âPost closing, we expect significant follow on business from IMDB and IMDB
Energy[,] including the IPO of IMDB Energy.â

43. As work progressed on Project Magnolia, between on or about March 25,
2012 and on or about March 29, 2012, Leissner and Ng traveled to Los Angeles, California and
New York, New York to discuss matters related to Project Magnolia with Low and others.
Leissner and Ng traveled using Goldman resources.

44. Meanwhile, although employees within Goldmanâs control functions
suspected that Low may be involved in the deal, the only step taken by the control functions to
investigate that suspicion was to ask members of the deal team whether Low was involved and to
accept their denials without reasonable confirmation.

45. For example, during a telephone call in or about March 2012, a high-
ranking employee in BIG and MD voiced suspicions that Low was involved in Project Magnolia.
Leissner denied that Low was involved. Similarly, on or about April 3, 2012, the day before a
FWCC meeting to discuss Project Magnolia, a high-ranking executive in BIG, who was also an
advisor to the FWCC (âEmployee 2â), emailed other members of BIG that âLeissner said Jho
Low not involved at all in deal as far as he [is] aware but that Low was present when Leissner
met [IPIC Official 1] in Abu Dhabi.â

46. On or about April 4, 2012, the FWCC meeting was held, which was
attended telephonically by Goldman executives in New York, New York. During this meeting,

Leissner was asked whether Low was involved in Project Magnolia and Leissner said that, other

14
than arranging a meeting between Leissner and IPIC Official 1, Low was not involved. Ng was
also present during this meeting and did not correct Leissnerâs false statement about Lowâs
involvement. Later that same day, after the FWCC meeting, Employee 2 emailed Leissner,
stating âI was told Jho Low attended the meeting you had with [IPIC Official 1]... that was
wrong.â Leissner responded that he âhand delivered a letter by the Prime Minister of Malaysia
to [IPIC Official 1] and the Crown Prince.â Employee 2 replied, âI guess Low will have had a
hand in fixing that you were able to carry the letter from the Malaysian PM . . . Important we
have no role on our side for Low and we should ask that any payments from any of [the]
participants to any intermediaries are declared and transparent.â Leissner agreed with Employee
2âs admonishment.

47. Goldmanâs control functions accepted the statements of the deal team
members about Lowâs involvement at face value, rather than taking additional steps that
Goldmanâs control functions took in other deals, such as reviewing the electronic
communications of members of the deal team to look for evidence of Lowâs involvement (e.g.,
searching for references to Low). For example, had Goldman conducted a review of Leissnerâs
electronic communications at this time, it would have discovered multiple messages linking Low
to, among others, the bond deal, IMDB officials, Malaysian Official 1 and Abu Dhabi Official 1,
as well as the use of personal email addresses by Leissner and Ng to discuss Goldman business.

48. During this time period, Low, Leissner and Ng continued to structure the
bribery scheme. Leissner and Ng ultimately understood that Low intended to use the funds
raised through Project Magnolia to pay bribes, and cause bribes to be paid, to foreign officials in
Malaysia and Abu Dhabi to influence those officials to obtain the necessary approvals and

assistance for Goldman to execute Project Magnolia.

15
49. On or about May 16, 2012, Goldmanâs committees approved Project
Magnolia, and on or about May 21, 2012, the $1.75 billion bond issuance closed. Goldman
purchased the entire bond issuance from 1MDB.

50. On or about May 22, 2012, Goldman caused approximately $907,500,000
in proceeds from Project Magnolia to be wired to a IMDB subsidiary (âIMDB Subsidiary 1ââ),
through a correspondent bank account in New York, New York. Goldman booked
approximately $192,500,000 in fees for this bond transaction and an additional approximately
$16,800,000 in fees for advising on the acquisition of Malaysian Energy Company A.

51. Low and others caused the following transfers of funds from the proceeds
of Project Magnolia:

a. On or about May 22, 2012, approximately $576,943,490 of the
Project Magnolia bond proceeds were transferred from the account of IMDB Subsidiary | to an
account at Foreign Financial Institution A (âShell Company Account 1ââ) in the name of a
company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands with a name similar to Aabar (âShell
Company 1â). However, Shell Company 1 was not, in fact, associated with Aabar but was rather
associated with Abu Dhabi Official 1, Abu Dhabi Official 2 and Low. Abu Dhabi Official 1 and
Abu Dhabi Official 2 were signatories on Shell Company Account 1, and Low exercised control
over Shell Company Account 1.

b. On or about May 25, 2012, approximately $295 million was
transferred via wire from Shell Company Account | to an account at a foreign bank in the name
of a shell company beneficially owned and controlled by Low and Individual | (âShell Company
Account 2â). On or about July 25, 2012, another approximately $133 million was transferred via

wire from Shell Company Account | to Shell Company Account 2.

16
C. On or about June 18, 2012, approximately $133 million was
transferred from Shell Company Account | to an account at Foreign Financial Institution A,
opened in the name of a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands and beneficially
owned and controlled by a close relative of Malaysian Official 1 (âShell Company Account 3â).
Between on or about August 8, 2012 and on or about August 22, 2012, another approximately
$16 million was transferred from Shell Company Account 2 through another shell company to
Shell Company Account 3.

d. Between on or about June 20, 2012 and on or about November 20,
2012, approximately $60 million was transferred over multiple wires from Shell Company
Account 3 to the account of U.S. Motion Picture Company 1, an account at U.S. Financial
Institution | in Los Angeles, California (âHolding Company | Accountâ). U.S. Motion Picture
Company | was a U.S. legal entity owned, in part, by a close relative of Malaysian Official 1,
and the funds transferred from Shell Company Account 3 to Holding Company | Account were
used to, among other things, finance movie productions.

e. Between on or about May 29, 2012 and on or about August 1,
2012, approximately $258.75 million was transferred via wire from Shell Company Account 2 to
an account at Foreign Financial Institution B in the name of Shell Company Account 4, which
was beneficially owned and controlled by Abu Dhabi Official 1.

f. Also between on or about May 29, 2012 and on or about July 13,
2012, approximately $35 million was transferred via wire from Shell Company Account 2 to an
account at Foreign Financial Institution C in the name of Shell Company Account 5, which was

beneficially owned and controlled by Abu Dhabi Official 2.

17
g. Between on or about June 15, 2012 and on or about July 9, 2012, a
total of approximately $1.6 million was transferred from Shell Company Account 2 through
another shell company account to an account at Foreign Financial Institution D that was
beneficially owned and controlled by IMDB Official 3.

h. Between on or about June 11, 2012 and on or about July 16, 2012,
approximately $51.96 million was transferred via wire through the United States from Shell
Company Account 2 to Holding Company 2 Account, which was beneficially owned and
controlled by Leissner and his close relative, and, in turn, approximately $24.4 million was
subsequently transferred from Holding Company 2 Account to an account at Foreign Financial
Institution E beneficially owned by Ngâs relative (âShell Company Account 6â).â

Project Maximus

52. Within weeks of closing Project Magnolia, in or about May 2012, IMDB
sought assistance from Goldman to purchase a second Malaysian energy company (âMalaysian
Energy Company Bââ) and to issue a bond to raise funds for the acquisition. In or about August
2012, IMDB agreed to purchase Malaysian Energy Company B for approximately $814 million
and planned to finance the purchase with another $1.75 billion bond guaranteed indirectly by
IPIC.

53. Once again, Goldmanâs control functions simply accepted at face value
the representations of the deal team members and failed to further investigate Lowâs suspected
involvement in this bond deal. For example, on or about June 20, 2012, a member of Goldmanâs

control functions asked members of the deal team, âIs Jho Low involve[d] in this transaction?

 

? Based on records, the name of the company that held Shell Company Account 6 subsequently
changed, but Shell Company Account 6 remained beneficially owned by Ngâs relative.

18
Please also keep us posted if there are any other politically exposed person involve[d] in this
transaction in a non-official capacity.â A deal team member responded âno.â

54. Additionally, on or about October 10, 2012, in response to committee
questions, Leissner told a firmwide committee that neither Low nor any intermediary was
involved in Project Maximus. Despite their continued concern, as evidenced by their repeated
questions, Goldmanâs control functions did not engage in electronic surveillance of Leissnerâs
correspondence or activities to determine whether Low was involved in the deal.

55. Goldmanâs continued control failures were further compounded when
Goldman ignored additional red flags raised by Project Maximus, including that IMDB was
seeking to raise additional funds within a few months of raising $1.75 billion via Project
Magnolia without having utilized the full amount from that deal, and was also seeking to raise
far more than was needed to acquire Malaysian Energy Company B. Goldmanâs control
functions also failed to verify how Project Magnoliaâs proceeds were used.

56. On or about October 19, 2012, Project Maximus closed. Goldman
purchased the entire bond issuance from IMDB. On or about October 19, 2012, Goldman
caused approximately $1.64 billion to be transferred via wire through correspondent accounts in
the United States to another 1MDB subsidiary (â1 MDB Subsidiary 2â). Goldman booked
approximately $110,000,000 in fees for Project Maximus.

57. Low and others caused the following transfers of funds from the proceeds
of Project Maximus:

a. On or about October 19, 2012, approximately $790,354,855 was

transferred from 1MDB Subsidiary 2 to Shell Company Account 1.

19
b. Between on or about October 24, 2012 and on or about December
17, 2012, approximately $664 million was transferred from Shell Company Account | to Shell
Company Account 2.

C. Between on or about October 23, 2012 and on or about November
14, 2012, approximately $106.2 million was transferred from Shell Company Account | to Shell
Company Account 3, which was beneficially owned and controlled by a close relative of
Malaysian Official 1.

d. Between on or about October 30, 2012 and on or about November
19, 2012, approximately $30 million was transferred from Shell Company Account 2 to an
account held by Malaysian Official 1.

e. Between on or about October 29, 2012 and on or about November
30, 2012, approximately $214 million was transferred from Shell Company Account 2 to Shell
Company Account 4, which was beneficially owned and controlled by Abu Dhabi Official 1.

f. Between on or about July 3, 2012 and on or about December 19,
2012, approximately $21 million was transferred from Shell Company Account 2 and another
shell entity to an account beneficially owned and controlled by an official in the government of
the United Arab Emirates (âUAE Official 1ââ).

g. Between on or about November 2, 2012 and on or about January
22, 2013, approximately $31.6 million was transferred from Shell Company Account 2 to Shell
Company Account 5 and another account beneficially owned and controlled by Abu Dhabi

Official 2 and his close relative.

20
h. On or about December 6, 2012, approximately $5 million was
transferred from Shell Company Account 2 to an account beneficially owned and controlled by
IMDB Official 3.

1. Between on or about December 6, 2012 and on or about January
21, 2013, approximately $20.5 million was transferred from Shell Company Account 2 to
Holding Company 2 Account.

58. Leissner then directed follow-on transfers from Holding Company 2
Account to government officials and others. For example, on or about December 4, 2012,
Leissner emailed his close relative from his personal account with bank account details and
amounts to be wired from Holding Company 2 Account to Malaysian Official 2, IMDB Official
4 and IMDB Official 5. On or about January 15, 2013, Leissner again emailed his close relative
from his personal account, correcting some banking information and adding a transfer to 1|MDB
Official 2.

a. On or about December 7, 2012, Leissner directed approximately
$1 million to be transferred from Holding Company 2 Account to an account beneficially owned
and controlled by Malaysian Official 2.

b. Between on or about December 7, 2012 and on or about December
20, 2012, Leissner directed approximately $700,000 to be transferred from Holding Company 2
Account to an account beneficially owned and controlled by 1MDB Official 5 and his close
relative.

C. On or about December 20, 2012, Leissner directed approximately
$1 million to be transferred from Holding Company 2 Account to an account beneficially owned

and controlled by 1MDB Official 1.

21
d. Also on or about January 17, 2013, Leissner directed
approximately $1 million to be transferred from Holding Company 2 Account to an account
beneficially owned and controlled by IMDB Official 4.

e. On or about January 17, 2013, Leissner directed approximately $1
million to be transferred from Holding Company 2 Account to an account beneficially owned
and controlled by 1MDB Official 2.

Project Catalyze

59. In or about November 2012, almost immediately after Project Maximus
closed, Leissner* and Low began working on another bond issuance. Ultimately, Goldman
underwrote a third bond issuance that raised an additional $3 billion for IMDB with Goldman
acting as arranger and underwriter. This bond issuance was purportedly intended to fund
1MDBâs portion of a joint venture with Aabar.

60. Goldmanâs control functions had continued suspicions that Low was
working on the third bond deal. Once again, however, the control functions relied solely on the
deal team membersâ denials of Lowâs involvement without any further scrutiny.

61. On or about April 24, 2013, a senior Goldman executive who was a
member of Goldmanâs approval committee located in New York, New York, emailed Leissner
about âIMDB,â asking: âIs there a story circulating about an intermediary on the Magnolia
trades??â Leissner responded, âNot that I am aware of .. . There definitely was no intermediary
on any of the trades. The blogs in Malaysia always try to link a young Chinese business man

[sic], Jho Low, to IMDB. That is not the case other than he was an advisor alongside other

 

3 Ng had a new position within Goldman by this time and did not work directly on the deal team
for Project Catalyze, but was recognized by Goldman as a continued contact point for IMDB.

22
prominent figures to the King of Malaysia at the time of the creation of IMDB.â There was no
follow-up by Goldmanâs control functions about Low.

62. Goldman also failed to address the other red flags that were raised by the
proposed $3 billion transaction, including, once again, IMDB raising large sums of money with
no identified use of proceeds within months of Project Magnolia and Project Maximus, and
Goldmanâs failure to verify use of past bond proceeds. Adding to the transactionâs risks was the
upcoming Malaysian general election, which directly affected the political future of Malaysian
Official 1.

63. Goldmanâs committees nevertheless approved Project Catalyze on or
about March 13, 2013, and the proceeds from Project Catalyze were issued on or about March
19, 2013. Goldman purchased the entire bond issuance from IMDB and booked approximately
$279,000,000 in fees on Project Catalyze.

64. Low and Leissner continued to pay bribes to government officials from
the bond proceeds. On or about March 19, 2013, Goldman transferred via wire from and through
the United States approximately $2.7 billion from Project Catalyze to an account for another
IMDB subsidiary (âIMDB Subsidiary 3â) at Foreign Financial Institution A. Subsequently,
Low caused approximately $1,440,188,045 to be transferred through a series of pass-through
accounts to accounts beneficially owned or controlled by Low and Individual 1. Low then
directed multiple transfers to various government officials, including:

a. On or about March 21, 2013, approximately $620 million was
transferred from a shell entity beneficially owned or controlled by Low, Shell Company Account

7, to an account beneficially owned and controlled by Malaysian Official 1. Four days later, on

23
or about March 25, 2013, another approximately $61 million was transferred from Shell
Company Account 7 to the same account for Malaysian Official 1.

b. On or about April 5, 2013, approximately $10 million was
transferred from Shell Company Account 8, an account beneficially owned and controlled by
Low, to an account beneficially owned and controlled by Abu Dhabi Official 2.

C. On or about July 1, 2013, approximately $1 million was transferred
from Shell Company Account 8 to an account beneficially owned and controlled by IMDB
Official 5.

d. On or about October 21, 2013, approximately $11.5 million was
transferred from Shell Company Account 8 to Shell Company Account 3.

e. On or about September 11, 2013, approximately $1 million was
transferred from Shell Company Account 8 to an account beneficially owned and controlled by
IMDB Official 1.

f. On or about September 11, 2013, approximately $1 million was
transferred from Shell Company Account 8 to an account beneficially owned and controlled by
Malaysian Official 2.

g. On or about September 11, 2013, approximately $980,000 was
transferred from Shell Company Account 8 to an account beneficially owned and controlled by
Malaysian Official 3.

h. On or about September 11, 2013, approximately $895,000 was
transferred from Shell Company Account 8 to an account beneficially owned and controlled by

Malaysian Official 4.

24
1. On or about July 3, 2013, approximately $65.1 million was
transferred from Shell Company Account 8 to Holding Company 2 Account. From there,
Leissner directed payment of approximately $4.2 million to Shell Company Account 6, which
was beneficially owned by Ngâs close relative.

j. On or about July 29, 2013, approximately $1 million was
transferred from Holding Company 2 Account to an account beneficially owned and controlled
by IMDB Official 2.

k. Also on or about July 29, 2013, approximately $1 million was
transferred from Holding Company 2 Account to an account beneficially owned and controlled
by IMDB Official 4.

L. On or about July 19, 2013, approximately $6 million was
transferred from Holding Company 2 Account to another account beneficially owned and
controlled by Leissner and his close relative, Management Company | Account. Subsequently,
on or about July 22, 2013, approximately $6 million was transferred from Management
Company | Account to an account beneficially owned and controlled by IMDB Official 3.

m. On or about June 27, 2013, Low transferred approximately $30
million from an account he beneficially owned and controlled to an account beneficially owned
and controlled by UAE Official 1.

Other Anticipated IMDB Deals
65. After the bond deals were complete, Goldman continued to pursue IMDB
business, including a role in the anticipated IMDB Energy IPO. In the pursuit of that additional
business, in or about September 2013, Goldman hosted a roundtable in New York for Malaysian

Official 1. Several senior Goldman executives, Leissner, Low, IMDB Official 3 and others were

25
scheduled to attend this meeting, though Low did not ultimately attend. However, during that
trip, a New York jeweler (âJeweler 1â) met with Low and the wife of Malaysian Official 1 ina
hotel suite at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in New York, New York, to show the wife of
Malaysian Official 1 a piece of expensive jewelry that Jeweler 1 had designed for her at Lowâs
request.

66. On or about January 13, 2014, IMDB invited Goldman to submit a
proposal to provide services to IMDB in connection with the IPO. Goldman worked on the
proposed IPO through 2014, during which time Low and Leissner continued to make or promise
corrupt payments to government officials, including from Project Catalyzeâs misappropriated
proceeds.

67. On or about June 2, 2014, Leissner sent an email to himself at his personal
email account containing a chat between himself and Low in which the two discussed IMDB
business opportunities that Goldman was trying to win at the time, including the IPO.
Specifically, they discussed how to manage officials at IMDB to steer additional business to
Goldman, including getting Goldman to serve as a Joint Global Coordinator for the IPO.

a. For example, Low stated that IMDB Official 2 and another high-
ranking IMDB official were unhappy with Goldman for not âdeliver[ing]ââ a loan to IMDB in
2013, which was ultimately provided by Foreign Financial Institution F. As a result, according
to Low, IMDB would only give Goldman a more limited role in the IPO. Leissner responded
that he âwould have deliveredâ the loan, and expressed frustration that Goldman was concerned
about issues related to IMDBâs delayed financial reporting at the time, declaring âCommittee is

stupid!!!â

26
b. Low and Leissner then agreed that Leissner would âbabysitâ
IMDB Official 2 and the high-ranking IMDB official, and Low would âmanage via [IMDB
Board of Directors]. Leissner also noted that neither named official provided âmuch of valueâ
but that they âneed[ed] to suck up to them.â

C. Low and Leissner also discussed sending âcakesâ to âmadam bossââ
and Low asked if he could transfer money to Management Company 1 Account so that Leissner
could âsettle madam cakes 2.â Low asked Leissner, âDo u mind if funds go [from] [Shell
Company 1] to u [sic] direct at [Management Company 1]? Or u [sic] think too sensitive?â
Leissner responded, â[Shell Company 1] is ok too. But need to get it out asap. Best today.
Because I am seriously in trouble.â

d. Low and Leissner further discussed Leissnerâs continued efforts to
onboard Low as a formal Goldman client. Leissner explained he would âpush harderâ for Low
once Leissner was confirmed as Goldmanâs Southeast Asia Chairman of the Investment Banking
Division.

68. On or about June 2, 2014, approximately $1.215 million was transferred
from Shell Company Account 8 to Management Company | Account.

69. On or about October 10, 2014, Leissner caused approximately $4.1
million to be transferred from Management Company | Account to Jeweler | in New York, New
York, in part to pay for approximately $1.3 million in jewelry that had been purchased on or
about January 3, 2014 by the wife of Malaysian Official | while she, Malaysian Official 1 and

Low were in the United States.

27
70. On or about October 14, 2014, Leissner transferred approximately
$600,000 from Holding Company 2 Account to an account beneficially owned and controlled by
Abu Dhabi Official 2 and his close relative.

71. Also on or about October 14, 2014, Leissner transferred approximately
$3.5 million from Holding Company 2 Account to the business account of an associate of
Malaysian Official 1âs relative.

Additional Failures of Goldmanâs Control Functions

72. After the bond deals were completed, in or about and between March 2013
and February 2016, additional red flags were raised in the press and on internal phone calls
among Goldmanâs employees and executives about Lowâs involvement in the deals and the
possible payment of bribes in connection with the deals. Goldman failed to investigate these red
flags or to perform an internal review of its role in the bond deals despite the clear implication
that the deals had involved criminal wrongdoing. Further, high ranking employees of Goldman
failed to escalate concerns about bribery and other criminal conduct related to the bond deals
pursuant to Goldmanâs escalation policy, which required that any Goldman employee who
became aware of any conduct that could raise, among others, ââa legal, compliance, reputational,
ethical, accounting, [or] internal accounting controlâ issue to report such conduct immediately to
a supervisor and Goldmanâs control functions.

73. Specifically, in or about May 2013, a Goldman PMD (âEmployee 3â) who
had been involved in the IMDB deals, discussed the deals in a series of phone calls with
Goldman senior executives that were recorded on Goldman phone lines. For example, on or
about May 8, 2013, Employee 3 called a senior Goldman executive about, among other things,

Project Catalyze. Employee 3 stated, âthe main reason for the delay for [IPIC] not having

28
funded their three billion into the JV with IMDB is [Abu Dhabi Official 1] is trying to get
something on the side in his pocket.â He continued later, âI think itâs quite disturbing to have
come across this piece of information... .â The senior Goldman executive replied, âWhatâs
disturbing about that? Itâs nothing new, is it?â In response, Employee 3 agreed that the situation
was nothing new. Employee 3 had at least one substantially similar phone conversation with at
least one other senior Goldman executive.

74. Subsequently, in May 2015 and again in October 2015, amid negative
media reporting linking Low with the IMDB bond deals and Malaysian Official 1, Goldman
executives and employees discussed Lowâs involvement in the [MDB deals. For example, ona
recorded call on or about October 13, 2015, Employee 3 told the senior Goldman executive that a
senior IPIC officer had informed his subordinate that âthere are a number of key people who are
involved in, letâs call it the situation. [Abu Dhabi Official 1] is one. Jho Low for sure. He
thinks Jho Low is the leader of the pack. And he has a very strong view that [Leissner] is
involved.â The control functions never took steps to address these red flags.

75. There were also subsequent emails and recorded phone calls between
Employee 3 and senior Goldman executives in the control functions about the disparity between
how due diligence and risk issues were handled on various deals. In particular, they discussed
the unusual latitude granted to certain employees, such as Leissner and Employee 1.

76. For example, in or about January 2016, on a recorded call between
Employee 2, who had been involved in BIGâs review of each of the relevant transactions, and
Employee 3, they discussed, among other things, Leissnerâs conduct, including Leissnerâs false
statements that Low was not involved in the IMDB deals. Employee 2 then noted that there

were several similarly âproblematicâ people from a compliance perspective at Goldman, and

29
Employee 3 agreed, immediately mentioning Employee | as an example of a âproblematicâ
person. Employee 3 also noted the âdouble standardâ between the minor repercussions meted
out to favored employees like Leissner and Employee | when they got caught trying to
circumvent the control functions, and the more serious repercussions to other, less favored
employees who engaged in similar behavior. Employee 2 agreed, stating, âYes, double standard,
and it looks stupid.ââ In the course of the call, Employee 2 also noted that Leissnerâs email
communications had been searched as part of an internal investigation into a separate incident
involving the use of an intermediary that occurred subsequent to the IMDB deals, which
Employee 2 stated âseems to me should have been done ages ago.ââ Employee 3 similarly
discussed on a recorded call in or about February 2016 with a high-ranking employee in
compliance and MD how repercussions for control functions violations varied radically between
deals.

Goldmanâs Other Low-Related Deals and Contacts

77. The IMDB bond deals and underlying acquisitions were not the only
Low-related transactions that Goldman engaged in during the relevant period. Despite the
negative view that Goldmanâs control functions took of Low, there were numerous potential and
completed deals with which Low was involved in some manner.

78. For example, Goldman served as an advisor on a deal in or about 2013
where a Low-related entity was one of the original clients. The deal was not submitted for due
diligence review until it was substantially finalized. At that point, BIG raised concerns about the
involvement of the Low-related entity and advised the deal team that the deal should not proceed
if Low was involved as a client, received a fee or had an active role in the deal. Through his

relationship with Abu Dhabi Official 1, Low arranged for another entity to become Goldmanâs

30
putative client. However, Low remained in the deal as a co-investor and an active participant.
Goldman deal team members knew this was merely a technical change in the deal structure, and
knew but did not inform BIG of Lowâs continued involvement in the deal. BIG employees were
later surprised to see press reports that the deal had been completed with Lowâs involvement in
late 2013. The deal resulted in a multi-million dollar fee for Goldman. Goldmanâs control
functions performed no additional review after the deal was completed.

79. In addition, senior executives at Goldman had continuing contact with
Low during the relevant period. These contacts included, but were not limited to, a meeting in or
about 2009 between a senior Goldman executive and PMD and Malaysian Official | that was
arranged by Low; a meeting in or about 2012 that was attended by a Goldman senior executive,
Abu Dhabi Official 2 and Low, among others; and a meeting on a yacht in Southern France in or
about 2013 attended by another senior Goldman executive and PMD, Leissner, Malaysian

Official 1 and Low, among others.

certifications by all such directors, officers, employees, agents, and business partners, certifying
compliance with the training requirements. The Company will conduct training in a manner
tailored to the audienceâs size, sophistication, or subject matter expertise and, where appropriate,
will discuss prior compliance incidents.

9, The Company will maintain, or where necessary establish, an effective system for
providing guidance and advice to directors, officers, employees, and, where necessary and
appropriate, agents and business partners, on complying with the Companyâs anti-corruption

in any foreign jurisdiction in which the Company operates.

11. = The Company will maintain, or where necessary establish, an effective and reliable
process with sufficient resources for responding to, investigating, and documenting allegations of
violations of the anti-corruption laws or the Companyâs anti-corruption compliance code, policies,
and procedures. The Company will handle the investigations of such complaints in an effective
manner, including routing the complaints to proper personnel, conducting timely and thorough

disciplining violations.

13. The Company will institute appropriate disciplinary procedures to address, among
other things, violations of the anti-corruption laws and the Companyâs anti-corruption compliance
code, policies, and procedures by the Companyâs directors, officers, and employees. Such
procedures should be applied consistently, fairly and in a manner commensurate with the violation,
regardless of the position held by, or perceived importance of, the director, officer, or employee.
The Company shall implement procedures to ensure that where misconduct is discovered,
reasonable steps are taken to remedy the harm resulting from such misconduct, and to ensure that
appropriate steps are taken to prevent further similar misconduct, including assessing the internal
controls, compliance code, policies, and procedures and making modifications necessary to ensure
the overall anti-corruption compliance program is effective.

and procedures, taking into account relevant developments in the field and evolving international
and industry standards. Company will ensure that compliance and control personnel have

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Thursday, October 22, 2020

Goldman Sachs Charged in Foreign Bribery Case and Agrees to Pay Over $2.9 Billion

The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (Goldman Sachs or the Company), a global financial institution headquartered in New York, New York, and
Goldman Sachs (Malaysia) Sdn. Bhd. (GS Malaysia), its Malaysian subsidiary, have admitted to conspiring to violate the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act (FCPA) in connection with a scheme to pay over $1 billion in bribes to Malaysian and Abu Dhabi officials to obtain lucrative
business for Goldman Sachs, including its role in underwriting approximately $6.5 billion in three bond deals for 1Malaysia Development Bhd.
(1MDB), for which the bank earned hundreds of millions in fees. Goldman Sachs will pay more than $2.9 billion as part of a coordinated
resolution with criminal and civil authorities in the United States, the United Kingdom, Singapore, and elsewhere.

Goldman Sachs entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the department in connection with a criminal information filed today in the
Eastern District of New York charging the Company with conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA. GS Malaysia pleaded
guilty in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York to a one-count criminal information charging it with conspiracy to violate the
anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA.

Previously, Tim Leissner, the former Southeast Asia Chairman and participating managing director of Goldman Sachs, pleaded guilty to
conspiring to launder money and to violate the FCPA. Ng Chong Hwa, also known as âRoger Ng,â former managing director of Goldman and
head of investment banking for GS Malaysia, has been charged with conspiring to launder money and to violate the FCPA. Ng was extradited
from Malaysia to face these charges and is scheduled to stand trial in March 2021. The cases are assigned to U.S. District Judge Margo K.
Brodie of the Eastern District of New York.

In addition to these criminal charges, the department has recovered, or assisted in the recovery of, in excess of $1 billion in assets for Malaysia
associated with and traceable to the 1MDB money laundering and bribery scheme.

âGoldman Sachs today accepted responsibility for its role in a conspiracy to bribe high-ranking foreign officials to obtain lucrative

underwriting and other business relating to 1MDB,â said Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian C. Rabbitt of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal
Division. âTodayâs resolution, which requires Goldman Sachs to admit wrongdoing and pay nearly three billion dollars in penalties, fines, and
disgorgement, holds the bank accountable for this criminal scheme and demonstrates the departmentâs continuing commitment

to combatting corruption and protecting the U.S. financial system.â

âOver a period of five years, Goldman Sachs participated in a sweeping international corruption scheme, conspiring to avail itself of more than
$1.6 billion in bribes to multiple high-level government officials across several countries so that the company could reap hundreds of millions of
dollars in fees, all to the detriment of the people of Malaysia and the reputation of American financial institutions operating abroad,â said Acting
U.S. Attorney Seth D. DuCharme of the Eastern District of New York. âTodayâs resolution, which includes a criminal guilty plea by Goldman
Sachsâ subsidiary in Malaysia, demonstrates that the department will hold accountable any institution that violates U.S. law anywhere in the
world by unfairly tilting the scales through corrupt practices.â

âWhen government officials and business executives secretly work together behind the scenes for their own illegal benefit, and not that of their
citizens and shareholders, their behavior lends credibility to the narrative that businesses donât succeed based on the quality of their products,
but rather their willingness to play dirty,â said Assistant Director in Charge William F. Sweeney Jr. of the FBIâs New York Field Office. âGreed
eventually exacts an immense cost on society, and unchecked corrupt behavior erodes trust in public institutions and government entities alike.
This case represents the largest ever penalty paid to U.S. authorities in an FCPA case. Our investigation into the looting of funds from 1MDB
remains ongoing. If anyone has information that could assist the case, call us at 1-800-CALLFBI.â

âIMDB was established to drive strategic initiatives for the long-term economic development of Malaysia. Goldman Sachs admitted today that
one billion dollars of the money earmarked to help the people of Malaysia was actually diverted and used to pay bribes to Malaysian and Abu
Dhabi officials to obtain their business,â said Special Agent in Charge Ryan L. Korner of IRS Criminal Investigationâs (IRS-Cl) Los Angeles Field
Office. âTodayâs guilty pleas demonstrate that the law applies to everyone, including large investment banks like Goldman Sachs. IRS Criminal
Investigation will work tirelessly alongside our law enforcement partners to identify and bring to justice those who engage in fraud and deceit
around the globe. When the American financial system is misused for corruption, the IRS will take notice and we will take action.â

According to Goldmanâs admissions and court documents, between approximately 2009 and 2014, Goldman conspired with others to violate the
FCPA by engaging in a scheme to pay more than $1.6 billion in bribes, directly and indirectly, to foreign officials in Malaysia and Abu Dhabi in
order to obtain and retain business for Goldman from 1MDB, a Malaysian state-owned and state-controlled fund created to pursue investment
and development projects for the economic benefit of Malaysia and its people. Specifically, the Company admitted to engaging in the bribery
scheme through certain of its employees and agents, including Leissner, Ng, and a former executive who was a participating managing director
and held leadership positions in Asia (Employee 1), in exchange for lucrative business and other advantages and opportunities. These included,
among other things, securing Goldmanâs role as an advisor on energy acquisitions, as underwriter on three lucrative bond deals with a total
value of $6.5 billion, and a potential role in a highly anticipated and even more lucrative initial public offering for 1MDBâs energy assets. As
Goldman admitted â and as alleged in the indictment pending in the Eastern District of New York against Ng and Low â in furtherance of the
scheme, Leissner, Ng, Employee 1, and others conspired to pay bribes to numerous foreign officials, including high-ranking officials in the
Malaysian government, 1MDB, Abu Dhabiâs state-owned and state-controlled sovereign wealth fund, International Petroleum Investment
Company (IPIC), and Abu Dhabiâs state-owned and state-controlled joint stock company, Aabar Investments PJS (Aabar).

Goldman admitted today that, in order to effectuate the scheme, Leissner, Ng, Employee 1, and others conspired with Low Taek |ho, aka Jho
Low, to promise and pay over $1.6 billion in bribes to Malaysian, 1MDB, IPIC, and Aabar officials. The co-conspirators allegedly paid these
bribes using more than $2.7 billion in funds that Low, Leissner, and other members of the conspiracy diverted and misappropriated from the
bond offerings underwritten by Goldman. Leissner, Ng and Low also retained a portion of the misappropriated funds for themselves and other
co-conspirators. Goldman admitted that, through Leissner, Ng, Employee 1 and others, the bank used Lowâs connections to advance and
further the bribery scheme, ultimately ensuring that IMDB awarded Goldman a role on three bond transactions between 2012 and 2013, known
internally at Goldman as âProject Magnolia,â âProject Maximus,â and âProject Catalyze.â

Goldman also admitted that, although employees serving as part of Goldmanâs control functions knew that any transaction involving Low posed
a significant risk, and although they were on notice that Low was involved in the transactions, they did not take reasonable steps to ensure that
Low was not involved. Goldman further admitted that there were significant red flags raised during the due diligence process and afterward â
including but not limited to Lowâs involvement â that either were ignored or only nominally addressed so that the transactions would be
approved and Goldman could continue to do business with 1MDB. As a result of the scheme, Goldman received approximately $606 million in
fees and revenue, and increased its stature and presence in Southeast Asia.

Under the terms of the agreements, Goldman will pay a criminal penalty and disgorgement of over $2.9 billion. Goldman also has reached
separate parallel resolutions with foreign authorities in the United Kingdom, Singapore, Malaysia, and elsewhere, along with domestic
authorities in the United States. The department will credit over $1.6 billion in payments with respect to those resolutions.

The department reached this resolution with Goldman based on a number of factors, including the Companyâs failure to voluntarily disclose the
conduct to the department; the nature and seriousness of the offense, which included the involvement of high-level employees within the
Companyâs investment bank and others who ignored significant red flags; the involvement of various Goldman subsidiaries across the world;
the amount of the bribes, which totaled over $1.6 billion; the number and high-level nature of the bribe recipients, which included at least 11
foreign officials, including high-ranking officials of the Malaysian government; and the significant amount of actual loss incurred by IMDB as a
result of the co-conspiratorsâ conduct. Goldman received partial credit for its cooperation with the departmentâs investigation, but did not
receive full credit for cooperation because it significantly delayed producing relevant evidence, including recorded phone calls in which the
Companyâs bankers, executives, and control function personnel discussed allegations of bribery and misconduct relating to the conduct in the
statement of facts. Accordingly, the total criminal penalty reflects a 10 percent reduction off the bottom of the applicable U.S. sentencing
guidelines fine range.

Low has also been indicted for conspiracy to commit money laundering and violate the FCPA, along with Ng, E.D.N.Y. Docket No. 18-CR-538
(MKB). Low remains a fugitive. The charges in the indictment as to Low and Ng are merely allegations, and those defendants are presumed
innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.

The investigation was conducted by the FBIâs International Corruption Unit and IRS-Cl. The prosecution is being handled by the Criminal
Divisionâs Fraud Section and the Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section (MLARS), and the Business and Securities Fraud Section of the
U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York. Trial Attorneys Katherine Nielsen, Nikhila Raj, Jennifer E. Ambuehl, Woo S. Lee, Mary
Ann McCarthy, Leo Tsao, and David Last of the Criminal Division, and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jacquelyn M. Kasulis, Alixandra Smith and Drew
Rolle of the Eastern District of New York are prosecuting the case. Additional Criminal Division Trial Attorneys and Assistant U.S. Attorneys
within U.S. Attorneyâs Offices for the Eastern District of New York and Central District of California have provided valuable assistance with
various aspects of this investigation, including with civil and criminal forfeitures. The Justice Departmentâs Office of International Affairs of the
Criminal Division provided critical assistance in this case.

The department also appreciates the significant assistance provided by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission; the Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System, including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York; the New York State Department of Financial Services, the
United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority; the United Kingdom Prudential Regulation Authority; the Attorney Generalâs Chambers of
Singapore; the Singapore Police Force-Commercial Affairs Division; the Monetary Authority of Singapore; the Office of the Attorney General and
the Federal Office of Justice of Switzerland; the judicial investigating authority of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and the Criminal Investigation
Department of the Grand-Ducal Police of Luxembourg; the Attorney Generalâs Chambers of Malaysia; the Royal Malaysian Police; and the
Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission. The department also expresses its appreciation for the assistance provided by the Ministry of Justice of
France; the Attorney General's Office of the Bailiwick of Guernsey and the Guernsey Economic Crime Division.

The Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice Departmentâs FCPA
enforcement efforts can be found at www.justice.gov/criminal-fraud/foreign-corrupt-practices-act.

MLARS'âs Bank Integrity Unit investigates and prosecutes banks and other financial institutions, including their officers, managers, and
employees, whose actions threaten the integrity of the individual institution or the wider financial system.

MLARSâs Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative, in partnership with federal law enforcement agencies, and often with U.S. Attorney's Offices,
seeks to forfeit the proceeds of foreign official corruption and, where appropriate, to use those recovered assets to benefit the people harmed
by these acts of corruption and abuse of office.

in other countries, (i) making regular factual presentations and investigative updates to the
Offices, and (111) voluntarily making foreign-based employees available for interviews in the
United States;

d. the Defendant and the Parent Company did not receive full credit for their
cooperation because the Defendant and the Parent Company were significantly delayed in
producing relevant evidence, including recorded phone calls in which the Parent Companyâs
bankers, executives, and control functions personnel discussed allegations of bribery and
misconduct relating to the conduct set forth in the Statement of Facts;

e. the Defendant and the Parent Company ultimately provided to the Offices
all relevant facts known to them, including information about the individuals involved in the
misconduct;

f. the Parent Company ultimately engaged in remedial measures, including
(i) implementing heightened controls and additional procedures and policies relating to
electronic surveillance and investigation, due diligence on proposed transactions or clients and
the use of third-party intermediaries across business units; and (11) enhancing anti-corruption
training for all management and relevant employees;

g. the Parent Company has committed to continuing to enhance its
compliance program and internal controls, including ensuring that its compliance program
satisfies the minimum elements set forth in Attachment C to the Parent Companyâs DPA;

h. based on the Parent Companyâs remediation, the state of the Parent
Companyâs compliance program and the Parent Companyâs agreement to report to the Offices as
set forth in Attachment D to the Parent Companyâs DPA, the Offices determined that an

independent compliance monitor is unnecessary;
1. the Parent Company has agreed, concurrent with this resolution, to resolve
additional investigations relating to the conduct described in the Statement of Facts, including by
entering into a Consent Order with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the
âthe Fedââ) pursuant to which it will pay a civil money penalty of $154 million; by settling an
Administrative Action filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the âSECââ) and
agreeing to pay $606 million in disgorgement and a civil monetary penalty of $400 million; by
entering into a Consent Order with the New York State Department of Financial Services (the
âDFSââ) pursuant to which it will agree to pay a civil money penalty of $150 million; by
resolving the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authorityâs and Prudential Regulation
Authorityâs (the âUK FCA and PRAâ) investigations and paying a civil penalty to each of $63
million (for a total of $126 million); by resolving the investigation by the Attorney-Generalâ s
Chambers of the Republic of Singapore (the âSingapore AGCââ) pursuant to which it will pay
$122 million; by resolving the investigation of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (the
âSingapore MASâ); by resolving with the Commercial Affairs Department of the Singapore
Police Force (the âSingapore CADââ); and by resolving the investigation by the Hong Kong
Securities and Futures Commission (the âHong Kong SFCâ) pursuant to which it will pay $350
million;

j. the nature and seriousness of the offense conduct, including, among other
things, the amount of bribes; the level and number of foreign officials bribed; the duration of the
scheme; the resulting illicit gains to and increased stature in the region for the Defendant and the
Parent Company from the deals, which were significant to the Defendant and the Parent

Company;
k. the Defendant and the Parent Company have no prior criminal history; and

L. the Defendant and the Parent Company have agreed to continue to
cooperate with the Offices in any ongoing investigation, as described in Paragraph 5 of the
Parent Companyâs DPA and Paragraphs 9 and 10 below;

m. Accordingly, after considering (a) through (1) above, the Defendant
received a discount of ten (10) percent off of the bottom of the otherwise-applicable Sentencing
Guidelines fine range for the conduct described in the Statement of Facts.

7. The Defendant agrees to abide by all terms and obligations of the Agreement as

described herein, including, but not limited to, the following:

a. to plead guilty as set forth in the Agreement;
b. to abide by all sentencing stipulations contained in the Agreement;
C. to appear, through its duly appointed representatives, as ordered for all

court appearances, and obey any other ongoing court order in this matter, consistent with all

applicable U.S. and foreign laws, procedures, and regulations;

d. to commit no further crimes;

e. to be truthful at all times with the Court;

f. to pay the applicable fine and special assessment;

g. to cooperate fully with the Offices as described in Paragraphs 9 and 10;
and

h. to work with the Parent Company in fulfilling the obligations of the Parent

Companyâs DPA.
8. Except as may otherwise be agreed by the parties in connection with a particular
transaction, the Defendant agrees that in the event that, during the term of the Parent Companyâ s
DPA (the ââTermââ), the Defendant undertakes any change in corporate form, including if it sells,
merges, or transfers business operations that are material to the Defendantâs consolidated
operations, or to the operations of any subsidiaries or affiliates involved in the conduct described
in the Statement of Facts, as they exist as of the date of this Agreement, whether such sale is
structured as a sale, asset sale, merger, transfer, or other change in corporate form, it shall
include in any contract for sale, merger, transfer, or other change in corporate form a provision
binding the purchaser, or any successor in interest thereto, to the obligations described in this
Agreement. The purchaser or successor in interest must also agree in writing that the Officesâ
ability to declare a breach under this Agreement is applicable in full force to that entity. The
Defendant agrees that the failure to include these provisions in the transaction will make any
such transaction null and void. The Defendant shall provide notice to the Offices at least 30 days
prior to undertaking any such sale, merger, transfer, or other change in corporate form. If the
Offices notify the Defendant prior to such transaction (or series of transactions) that they have
determined that the transaction or transactions have the effect of circumventing or frustrating the
enforcement purposes of this Agreement, as determined in the sole discretion of the Offices, the
Defendant agrees that such transaction or transactions will not be consummated. In addition, if
at any time during the Term of the Agreement the Offices determine in their sole discretion that
the Defendant has engaged in a transaction or transactions that have the effect of circumventing
or frustrating the enforcement purposes of this Agreement, they may deem them a breach of this

Agreement pursuant to Paragraphs 22 to 25 of this Agreement. Nothing herein shall restrict the
Defendant from indemnifying (or otherwise holding harmless) the purchaser or successor in
interest for penalties or other costs arising from any conduct that may have occurred prior to the
date of the transaction, so long as such indemnification does not have the effect of circumventing
or frustrating the enforcement purposes of this Agreement, as determined by the Offices.

9. The Defendant shall, subject to applicable law and regulations, cooperate fully
with the Offices in any and all matters relating to the conduct described in the Agreement and the
Statement of Facts and other conduct under investigation by the Offices or any other component
of the Department of Justice at any time during the Term until the later of the date upon which
all investigations and prosecutions arising out of such conduct are concluded, or the end of the
Term. At the request of the Offices, the Defendant shall also cooperate fully with other domestic
or foreign law enforcement and regulatory authorities and agencies, as well as the MDBs in any
investigation of the Defendant, the Parent Company, or its affiliates, or any of its present or
former officers, directors, employees, agents, and consultants, or any other party, in any and all
matters relating to the conduct described in this Agreement and the Statement of Facts and any
other conduct under investigation by the Offices or any other component of the Department of
Justice. The Defendantâs cooperation pursuant to this Paragraph is subject to applicable laws
and regulations, as well as valid claims of attorney-client privilege or attorney work product
doctrine; however, the Defendant must provide to the Offices a log of any information or
cooperation that is not provided based on an assertion of law, regulation, or privilege, and the
Defendant bears the burden of establishing the validity of any such assertion. The Defendant
agrees that its cooperation pursuant to this Paragraph shall include, but not be limited to, the

following:
a. The Defendant shall truthfully disclose all factual information not
protected by a valid claim of attorney-client privilege or work product doctrine with respect to its
activities, those of its Parent Company and affiliates, and those of its present and former
directors, officers, employees, agents, and consultants, including any evidence or allegations and
internal or external investigations, about which the Defendant has any knowledge or about which
the Offices may inquire. This obligation of truthful disclosure includes, but is not limited to, the
obligation of the Defendant to provide to the Offices, upon request, any document, record or
other tangible evidence about which the Offices may inquire of the Defendant.

b. Upon request of the Offices, the Defendant shall designate knowledgeable
employees, agents or attorneys to provide to the Offices the information and materials described
in Paragraph 9(a) above on behalf of the Defendant. It is further understood that the Defendant
must at all times provide complete, truthful, and accurate information.

C. The Defendant shall use its best efforts to make available for interviews or
testimony, as requested by the Offices, present or former officers, directors, employees, agents
and consultants of the Defendant. This obligation includes, but is not limited to, sworn
testimony before a federal grand jury or in federal trials, as well as interviews with domestic or
foreign law enforcement and regulatory authorities. Cooperation under this Paragraph shall
include identification of witnesses who, to the knowledge of the Defendant, may have material
information regarding the matters under investigation.

d. With respect to any information, testimony, documents, records or other
tangible evidence provided to the Offices pursuant to this Agreement, the Defendant consents to

any and all disclosures, subject to applicable law and regulations, to other governmental

10
authorities, including United States authorities and those of a foreign government, as well as the
MDBs, of such materials as the Offices, in their sole discretion, shall deem appropriate.

10. In addition to the obligations in Paragraph 9, during the Term, should the
Defendant learn of any evidence or any allegations of conduct that may constitute a violation of
the money laundering laws that involve the employees or agents of the Defendant, or should the
Defendant learn of any evidence or allegation of conduct that may constitute a violation of the
FCPAâs anti-bribery or accounting provisions had the conduct occurred within the jurisdiction of
the United States, the Defendant shall promptly report such evidence or allegation to the Offices.
Thirty days prior to the end of the Term, the Defendant, by a Member of the Board of Directors
of the Defendant, will certify, in the form of executing the document attached as Attachment C to
this Agreement, to the Offices that the Defendant has met its disclosure obligations pursuant to
this Paragraph. Each certification will be deemed a material statement and representation by the
Defendant to the executive branch of the United States for purposes of Title 18, United States
Code, Sections 1001 and 1519, and it will be deemed to have been made in the judicial district in
which this Agreement is filed.

11. The Defendant agrees that any fine imposed by the Court will be due and payable
as specified in Paragraph 19 below, and that any restitution imposed by the Court will be due and
payable in accordance with the Courtâs order. The Defendant further agrees to pay to the Clerk
of the Court for the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York the
mandatory special assessment of $400 (pursuant to Title 18, United States Code, Section

3013(a)(2)(B)) within 10 business days from the date of sentencing.

11
THE UNITED STATESâ AGREEMENT

 

12. In exchange for the guilty plea of the Defendant and the complete fulfillment of
all of its obligations under this Agreement, the Offices agree that they will not file additional
criminal charges against the Defendant, the Parent Company or any of its direct or indirect
affiliates, subsidiaries or joint ventures relating to any of the conduct described in the Statement
of Facts or the Information filed pursuant to this Agreement. The Offices, however, may use any
information related to the above referenced conduct against the Defendant: (a) in a prosecution
for perjury or obstruction of justice; (b) in a prosecution for making a false statement; (c) in a
prosecution or other proceeding relating to any crime of violence; or (d) in a prosecution or other
proceeding relating to a violation of any provision of Title 26 of the United States Code. This
Agreement does not provide any protection against prosecution for any future conduct by the
Defendant or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries. In addition, this Agreement does not
provide any protection against prosecution of any individuals, regardless of their affiliation with
the Defendant. The Defendant agrees that nothing in this Agreement is intended to release the
Defendant from any and all of the Defendantâs tax liabilities and reporting obligations for any
and all income not properly reported and/or legally or illegally obtained or derived.

FACTUAL BASIS

 

13. The Defendant is pleading guilty because it is guilty of the charge contained in the
Information. The Defendant admits, agrees, and stipulates that the factual allegations set forth in
the Information and the Statement of Facts are true and correct, that it is responsible for the acts

of its officers, directors, employees, and agents described in the Information and the Statement of

12
Facts, and that the Information and the Statement of Facts accurately reflect the Defendantâs
criminal conduct.
THE DEFENDANTâS WAIVER OF RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO APPEAL

14. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(f) and Federal Rule of Evidence 410 limit
the admissibility of statements made in the course of plea proceedings or plea discussions in both
civil and criminal proceedings, if the guilty plea is later withdrawn. The Defendant expressly
warrants that it has discussed these rules with its counsel and understands them. Solely to the
extent set forth below, the Defendant voluntarily waives and gives up the rights enumerated in
Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(f) and Federal Rule of Evidence 410. The Defendant
agrees that, effective as of the date the Defendant signs this Agreement, it will not dispute the
Statement of Facts set forth in this Agreement, and that the Statement of Facts shall be admissible
against the Defendant in any criminal case involving any of the Offices and the Defendant, as: (a)
substantive evidence offered by the government in its case-in-chief and rebuttal case; (b)
impeachment evidence offered by the government on cross-examination; and (c) evidence at any
sentencing hearing or other hearing. In addition, the Defendant also agrees not to assert any claim
under the Federal Rules of Evidence Gincluding Rule 410 of the Federal Rules of Evidence), the
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (including Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal
Procedure), or the Sentencing Guidelines (including USSG Â§ 1B1.1(a)) that the Statement of Facts
set forth in this Agreement should be suppressed or is otherwise inadmissible as evidence (in any
form). Specifically, the Defendant understands and agrees that any statements that it makes in the
course of its guilty plea or in connection with the Agreement are admissible against it for any

purpose in any U.S. federal criminal proceeding if, even though the Offices have fulfilled all of

13
their obligations under this Agreement and the Court has imposed the agreed-upon sentence, the
Defendant nevertheless withdraws its guilty plea.

15. The Defendant is satisfied that the Defendantâs attorneys have rendered effective
assistance. The Defendant understands that by entering into this Agreement, the Defendant
surrenders certain rights as provided in this Agreement. The Defendant understands that the

rights of criminal defendants include the following:

a. the right to plead not guilty and to persist in that plea;
b. the right to a jury trial;
C. the right to be represented by counsel â and if necessary have the court

appoint counsel â at trial and at every other stage of the proceedings;

d. the right at trial to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses, to be
protected from compelled self-incrimination, to testify and present evidence, and to compel the
attendance of witnesses; and

e. pursuant to Title 18, United States Code, Section 3742, the right to appeal
the sentence imposed.

Nonetheless, the Defendant knowingly waives the right to appeal or collaterally attack the
conviction and any sentence within the statutory maximum described below (or the manner in
which that sentence was determined) on the grounds set forth in Title 18, United States Code,
Section 3742, or on any ground whatsoever except those specifically excluded in this Paragraph,
in exchange for the concessions made by the Offices in this Agreement. The Agreement does
not affect the rights or obligations of the Offices as set forth in Title 18, United States Code,

Section 3742(b). The Defendant also knowingly waives the right to bring any collateral attack

14
challenging either the conviction or the sentence imposed in this case. The Defendant hereby
waives all rights, whether asserted directly or by a representative, to request or receive from any
department or agency of the United States any records pertaining to the investigation or
prosecution of this case, including without limitation any records that may be sought under the
Freedom of Information Act, Title 5, United States Code, Section 552, or the Privacy Act, Title
5, United States Code, Section 552a. The Defendant waives all defenses based on the statute of
limitations and venue with respect to any prosecution related to the conduct described in the
Information and the Statement of Facts, including any prosecution that is not time-barred on the
date that this Agreement is signed in the event that: (a) the conviction is later vacated for any
reason; (b) the Defendant violates the Agreement; or (c) the plea is later withdrawn, provided
such prosecution is brought within one year of any such vacation of conviction, violation of the
Agreement, or withdrawal of plea plus the remaining time period of the statute of limitations as
of the date that this Agreement is signed. The Offices are free to take any position on appeal or
any other post-judgment matter. The parties agree that any challenge to the Defendantâs
sentence that is not foreclosed by this Paragraph will be limited to that portion of the sentencing
calculation that is inconsistent with (or not addressed by) this waiver. Nothing in the foregoing
waiver of appellate and collateral review rights shall preclude the Defendant from raising a claim
of ineffective assistance of counsel in an appropriate forum.
PENALTY

16. The statutory maximum sentence that the Court can impose for a violation of Title

18, United States Code, Section 371, is: a fine of $500,000 or twice the gross pecuniary gain or

gross pecuniary loss resulting from the offense, whichever is greatest (Title 18, United States

15
Code, Section 371 and Title 18, United States Code, Sections 3571(c) and (d)); five yearsâ
probation (Title 18, United States Code, Section 3561(c)(1)); a mandatory special assessment of
$400 per count (Title 18, United States Code, Section 3013(a)(2)(B)); and restitution in the
amount of any victimsâ losses as ordered by the Court. In this case, the parties agree that the
gross pecuniary gain resulting from the offense is $1,607,700,000. Therefore, pursuant to Title
18, United States Code, Section 3571(d), the maximum fine that may be imposed is twice the
gross loss, or approximately $3,215,400,000 per offense.

SENTENCING RECOMMENDATION

 

17. The parties agree that pursuant to United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005),
the Court must determine an advisory Sentencing Guidelines range. The Court will then
determine a reasonable sentence within the statutory range after considering the advisory
Sentencing Guidelines range and the factors listed in Title 18, United States Code, Section
3553(a). The partiesâ agreement herein to any guideline sentencing factors constitutes proof of
those factors sufficient to satisfy the applicable burden of proof. The Defendant also understands
that if the Court accepts this Agreement, the Court is bound by the sentencing provisions in
Paragraph 19.

18. The Offices and the Defendant agree that a faithful application of the Sentencing
Guidelines to determine the applicable fine range yields the following analysis:

a. The 2018 USSG are applicable to this matter.

b. Offense Level. Based upon USSG Â§ 2C1.1, the total offense level is 48,
calculated as follows:

(a)(2) Base Offense Level 12

(b)(1) Multiple Bribes +2

16
19.

Offices and the Defendant agree that the following represents the appropriate disposition of the

Case:

(b)(2) Value of Benefit more than $550 million +30

(b)(3) High-Level Official Involved +4

TOTAL 48

Base Fine. Based upon USSG Â§ 8C2.4(a)(3), the base fine is
$1,607,700,000 (value of the unlawful payments, pursuant to USSG Â§
2C1.1(d)(1)).

Culpability Score. Based upon USSG Â§ 8C2.5, the culpability score is 8,

calculated as follows:
(a) Base Culpability Score 5
(b)(1) The organization had 5,000 or more employees

and an individual within high-level personnel of the
organization participated in, condoned or was

willfully ignorant of the offense +5
(g)(2) Cooperation and Acceptance -2-
TOTAL 8

Calculation of Fine Range:

 

Base Fine (USSG Â§Â§ 8C2.4(a), (e))
Multipliers (USSG Â§ 8C2.6)

Fine Range (USSG Â§ 8C2.7)

Pursuant to Rule 11(c)(1)(C) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the

Disposition. Pursuant to Fed. R. Crim, P. 11(c)(1)(C), the Offices and the

Defendant agree that the appropriate disposition of this case is as set forth above, and agree to

recommend jointly that the Court, at a hearing to be scheduled at an agreed upon time, impose a

17

$1,607,700,000
1.6 (min)/3.2 (max)

$2,572,320,000 to $5,144,640,000
sentence requiring the Defendant to pay a $500,000 criminal fine within ten business days of the
sentencing hearing (the âRecommended Sentenceââ). Specifically, the parties agree that the
Recommended Sentence is appropriate in light of the Parent Companyâs DPA, which relates to
the same conduct to which the Defendant is pleading guilty. Pursuant to the DPA, the Parent
Company and the Offices agreed, based on the application of the USSG to the misconduct, that
the appropriate disgorgement is $606 million (the âDisgorgement Amountâ) and the total
monetary penalty is $2,315,088,000 (the âTotal Criminal Penaltyâ), $500,000 of which will be
paid as a criminal fine by the Defendant pursuant to this Agreement. The Total Criminal Penalty
reflects a ten (10) percent discount off the bottom of the applicable USSG fine range for the
Parent Companyâs cooperation. The Parent Company and the Offices further agreed that the
Parent Company will pay the United States $1,263,088,000, $500,000 of which will be paid as a
criminal fine by the Defendant pursuant to this Agreement, to the United States Treasury within
ten business days of the sentencing hearing by the Court of the Defendant in connection with this
Agreement. The Offices agreed to credit the remaining amount of the Total Criminal Penalty
against the amount the Parent Company pays to the SEC, Fed, DFS, UK FCA and PRA,
Singapore AGC, Singapore CAD and Hong Kong SFC. The Offices will credit the entire
penalty amount that the Parent Company pays to the SEC, Fed, DFS, UK FCA and PRA,
Singapore AGC and Singapore CAD, as well as $100 million of the penalty the Parent Company
pays to Hong Kong SFC, in connection with parallel resolutions entered into between the Parent
Company and those authorities. The Parent Companyâs payment obligations to the United States
under the Agreement will be complete upon the Parent Companyâs payment of $1,263,088,000,

$500,000 of which will be paid as a criminal fine by the Defendant pursuant to this Agreement,

18
so long as the Parent Company pays the remaining amount of the Total Criminal Penalty to the
SEC, Fed, DFS, UK FCA and PRA, Singapore AGC, and Hong Kong SFC, by the end of one
year from the beginning of the Term. Should any amount of such payments to these authorities
not be made by the end of one year from the beginning of the Term, or be returned to the Parent
Company or any affiliated entity for any reason, the remaining balance of the Total Criminal
Penalty will be paid to the United States Treasury. The Offices further agree to credit the
Disgorgement Amount against any amount equal or greater to the Disgorgement Amount that the
Company pays to authorities in Malaysia in connection with the conduct detailed in the
Statement of Facts, if paid within one year from the beginning of the Term. Should the Parent
Company not pay the full Disgorgement Amount to Malaysia by one year from the beginning of
the Term, or should all or a portion of the Disgorgement Amount be returned to the Parent
Company or any affiliated entity for any reason, the remaining balance of the Disgorgement
Amount will be paid to the United States Treasury, except that the Offices agree to credit any
part of this amount that is paid to the SEC as disgorgement.

b. The Defendant shall not seek or accept directly or indirectly
reimbursement or indemnification from any source, other than the Parent Company, with regard
to the fine, penalty, forfeiture, or disgorgement amounts that the Defendant or the Parent
Company pays pursuant to the Agreement, the DPA or any other agreement entered into with an
enforcement authority or regulator concerning the facts set forth in the Statement of Facts. The
Defendant further acknowledges that no tax deduction may be sought in connection with the

payment of any part of this fine.

19
C. Mandatory Special Assessment. The Defendant shall pay to the Clerk of

 

the Court for the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York within 10
days of the date of sentencing the mandatory special assessment of $400.

d. Restitution. As of the date of the Agreement, the Offices and the
Defendant have not identified any victim qualifying for restitution and thus are not requesting an
order of restitution. The Defendant recognizes and agrees, however, that restitution is imposed
at the sole discretion of the Court. The Defendant agrees to pay restitution as part of the
Agreement in the event restitution is ordered by the Court.

20. This Agreement is presented to the Court pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P.
11(c)(1)(C). The Defendant understands that, if the Court rejects this Agreement, the Court
must: (a) inform the parties that the Court rejects the Agreement; (b) advise the Defendantâs
counsel that the Court is not required to follow the Agreement and afford the Defendant the
opportunity to withdraw its plea; and (c) advise the Defendant that if the plea is not withdrawn,
the Court may dispose of the case less favorably toward the Defendant than the Agreement
contemplated. The Defendant further understands that if the Court refuses to accept any
provision of this Agreement, neither party shall be bound by the provisions of the Agreement.

21. The Defendant and the Offices waive the preparation of a Pre-Sentence
Investigation Report (âPSRâââ) and intend to ask the Court to set a sentencing hearing in the
absence of a PSR at a date in the future. The Defendant understands that the decision whether to
proceed with the sentencing proceeding without a PSR is exclusively that of the Court. In the
event the Court directs the preparation of a PSR, the Offices will fully inform the preparer of the

PSR and the Court of the facts and law related to the Defendantâs case.

20
BREACH OF AGREEMENT

 

22. If the Defendant (a) commits any felony under U.S. federal law; (b) provides in
connection with this Agreement deliberately false, incomplete, or misleading information; (c)
fails to cooperate as set forth in Paragraphs 9 and 10 of this Agreement; (d) commits any acts
that, had they occurred within the jurisdictional reach of the FCPA, would be a violation of the
FCPA; or (e) otherwise fails specifically to perform or to fulfill completely each of the
Defendantâs obligations under the Agreement, regardless of whether the Offices become aware
of such a breach after the Term, the Defendant shall thereafter be subject to prosecution for any
federal criminal violation of which the Offices have knowledge, which may be pursued by the
Offices or any other United States Attorneyâs Office. Determination of whether the Defendant
has breached the Agreement and whether to pursue prosecution of the Defendant shall be in the
Officesâ sole discretion. Any such prosecution may be premised on information provided by the
Defendant or its personnel. Any such prosecution relating to the conduct described in the
Information and the attached Statement of Facts or relating to conduct known to the Offices prior
to the date on which this Agreement was signed that is not time-barred by the applicable statute
of limitations on the date of the signing of this Agreement may be commenced against the
Defendant, notwithstanding the expiration of the statute of limitations, between the signing of
this Agreement and the expiration of the Term of the Agreement plus one year. Thus, by signing
this Agreement, the Defendant agrees that the statute of limitations with respect to any such
prosecution that is not time-barred on the date of the signing of this Agreement shall be tolled for
the Term plus one year. The Defendant gives up all defenses based on the statute of limitations,

any claim of pre-indictment delay, or any speedy trial claim with respect to any such prosecution

21
or action, except to the extent that such defenses existed as of the date of the signing of this
Agreement. In addition, the Defendant agrees that the statute of limitations as to any violation of
federal law that occurs during the term of the cooperation obligations provided for in Paragraphs
9 and 10 of the Agreement will be tolled from the date upon which the violation occurs until the
earlier of the date upon which the Offices are made aware of the violation or the duration of the
Term plus five years, and that this period shall be excluded from any calculation of time for
purposes of the application of the statute of limitations.

23. In the event the Offices determine that the Defendant has breached this
Agreement, the Offices agree to provide the Defendant with written notice of such breach prior
to instituting any prosecution resulting from such breach. Within 30 days of receipt of such
notice, the Defendant shall have the opportunity to respond to the Offices in writing to explain
the nature and circumstances of such breach, as well as the actions the Defendant has taken to
address and remediate the situation, which explanation the Offices shall consider in determining
whether to pursue prosecution of the Defendant.

24. In the event that the Offices determine that the Defendant has breached this
Agreement: (a) all statements made by or on behalf of the Defendant to the Offices or to the
Court, including the Information and the Statement of Facts, and any testimony given by the
Defendant before a grand jury, a court, or any tribunal, or at any legislative hearings, whether
prior or subsequent to this Agreement, and any leads derived from such statements or testimony,
shall be admissible in evidence in any and all criminal proceedings brought by the Offices
against the Defendant; and (b) the Defendant shall not assert any claim under the United States

Constitution, Rule 11(f) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rule 410 of the Federal

22
Rules of Evidence, or any other federal rule that any such statements or testimony made by or on
behalf of the Defendant prior or subsequent to this Agreement, or any leads derived therefrom,
should be suppressed or are otherwise inadmissible. The decision whether conduct or statements
of any current director, officer or employee, or any person acting on behalf of, or at the direction
of, the Defendant, will be imputed to the Defendant for the purpose of determining whether the
Defendant has violated any provision of this Agreement shall be in the sole discretion of the
Offices.

25. The Defendant acknowledges that the Offices have made no representations,
assurances, or promises concerning what sentence may be imposed by the Court if the Defendant
breaches this Agreement and this matter proceeds to judgment. The Defendant further
acknowledges that any such sentence is solely within the discretion of the Court and that nothing
in this Agreement binds or restricts the Court in the exercise of such discretion.

PUBLIC STATEMENTS BY THE DEFENDANT

 

26. The Defendant expressly agrees that it shall not, through present or future
attorneys, officers, directors, employees, agents or any other person authorized to speak for the
Defendant make any public statement, in litigation or otherwise, contradicting the acceptance of
responsibility by the Defendant set forth above or the facts described in the Information and the

The Criminal Scheme
Overview

23. In or about and between 2009 and 2014, Goldman, through certain of its
agents and employees, together with others, knowingly and willfully conspired and agreed with
others to corruptly provide payments and things of value to, or for the benefit of, foreign officials
and their relatives to induce those foreign officials to influence the decisions of IMDB, IPIC and
Aabar to obtain and retain business for Goldman, including positions as an advisor to IMDB on
the acquisitions of Malaysian energy assets, underwriter of the IMDB bonds, and underwriter of
certain other IMDB business, including the contemplated initial public offering (âIPOââ) of
1MDBâs Malaysian energy assets. Leissner, Ng and Employee | used Lowâs connections within
the Governments of Malaysia and Abu Dhabi to obtain and retain this and other business for
Goldman and, in turn, concealed Lowâs involvement in the deals from certain employees and
agents of Goldman. In total, Goldman conspired to provide approximately $1.6077 billion to, or
for the benefit of, foreign officials and their relatives, of which approximately $18.1 million was
paid from accounts controlled by Leissner.

24. The bribes resulted in Goldman being engaged on, among other projects,
three bond offerings that were related to 1MDBâs energy acquisitions and that raised a total of
approximately $6.5 billion for IMDB in 2012 and 2013. The bribes were also intended to help

Goldman secure a role on the anticipated IPO of those energy assets. These three bond offerings
and a related acquisition, along with a transaction involving Low and IPIC,! ultimately earned
Goldman in excess of $600 million in fees and revenue across its divisions, and increased
Goldmanâs stature in Southeast Asia. In the course of this scheme, payments and
communications made in furtherance of the scheme were made via wires that passed through the
Eastern District of New York.

25. Pursuant to Goldmanâs internal accounting controls, each IMDB bond
transaction required Goldman managementâs general and specific authorization. Moreover,
because Goldman initially purchased the full value of each bond from IMDB using Goldmanâs
assets, the transactions needed to be appropriately authorized and properly recorded. Among
other things, Goldmanâs internal accounting controls included the Firmwide Capital Committee
(âFWCCââ), which was authorized by Goldmanâs Chief Executive Officer to provide global
oversight and approval of bond transactions, including those transactions in which Goldman used
its own assets to purchase the financial instruments, like the IMDB bonds. Goldmanâs internal
accounting controls also included approval of the bonds by Goldmanâs Business Intelligence
Group (âBIGâ) and compliance, both of which were represented on the FWCC. While certain of
Goldmanâs employees and agents, including Leissner, Ng and Employee 1, circumvented these
and other controls, other Goldman employees and agents who were responsible for implementing
its internal accounting controls failed to do so in connection with the IMDB bond deals.
Specifically, although employees serving as part of Goldmanâs control functions knew that any
transaction involving Low posed a significant risk, and although they were on notice that he was
involved in the transactions, they did not take reasonable steps to ensure that Low was not

involved. Additionally, there were significant red flags raised during the due diligence process

 

' This transaction involved Leissner, Employee 1, Low and IPIC, and Lowâs monetary
contribution to this deal involved funds misappropriated from the bond offerings.

9
and afterward, including, but not limited to, Lowâs involvement in the deals, that were either
ignored or only nominally addressed so that the transactions would be approved and Goldman
could continue to do business with IMDB.

Goldmanâs Relationship with Low

26. In or about 2009, Leissner and Ng were introduced to Low, who was
known to be close to various high-ranking officials in Malaysia and Abu Dhabi, and through
Low began cultivating relationships with Malaysian Official 1 and others to secure business for
Goldman.

27. In or about January 2009, Leissner and Ng discussed with Low and others
a role for Goldman in the creation of and potential fundraising for Terengganu Investment
Authority (âTIAâ), IMDBâs predecessor entity.

28. Leissner and Ng also attempted to onboard Low as a Goldman client, or
otherwise work with Low, on numerous occasions in or about and between 2009 and 2013. For
example, in or about September 2009, Ng referred Low for a private wealth management account
(âPWMâ) through a Goldman European subsidiary. Ng described Low as âour partner in a lot of
transactions in [M]alaysia. Largely the mid-east and [M]alaysia rationship [sic]. As part of the
onboarding process, Goldmanâs control functions, including BIG, vetted Lowâs finances and
raised questions about his source of wealth. As control functions personnel worked to diligence
those questions about Low, the business side continued to pressure them to approve Low as a
client. In a March 13, 2010 email, a Goldman regional head of compliance wrote to a high-level
BIG executive and others, expressing frustration with the pressure to approve Low and
underscoring the red flags Low raised as a client:

This has been an exceptionally trying experience I have to admit, and I believe that
no matter what we do [Goldman PWM representative] is not willing to accept that

10
we are not in a position to onboard this prospect .. . I do not believe we will ever
be able to get comfortable with this matter. Iâd like to shut this down once and for
all... Itis seldom that one sees a vendor report, which has been backed up verbally
by them, that so clearly states that we should exercise extreme caution.

29. Ultimately, BIG personnel rejected Low as a Goldman client because of
his inability to satisfactorily answer questions raised by Goldmanâs control functions, as well as
negative news coverage about Lowâs lavish spending. Notwithstanding this rejection, there were
additional attempts to onboard Low and his companies as a Goldman client.

30. For example, in early 2011, Leissner tried to onboard two of Lowâs
companies as clients of Goldman but was unable to do so due to complianceâs continued
objections to Low.

31. Around the same time, Leissner made an additional attempt to bring Low
on as a PWM client through Goldmanâs Singapore office, without referencing the prior attempt.
Low was again denied due to, among other things, his questionable source of wealth. In a March
11, 2011 email chain discussing the attempt, a high-ranking employee in compliance and MD
noted, âTo be clear, we have pretty much zero appetite for a relationship with this individual,â
and a high-ranking employee in BIG and MD expressed, âthis is a name to be avoided.â

32. Even after the control functions had rejected Low as a client, Leissner, Ng
and others at Goldman continued their relationship with Low and used him to obtain and retain
business for Goldman from 1MDB and others. In or about and between 2012 and 2013,
Leissner, Ng, Employee | and other Goldman employees worked with Low to help IMDB raise

more than $6.5 billion via three separate bond offering transactions, referred to internally at

Goldman as âProject Magnolia,â âProject Maximusâ and âProject Catalyze,â respectively.

11
Project Magnolia

33. In or about February 2012, IMDB engaged Goldman as its financial
advisor for its anticipated purchase of a Malaysian energy company (âMalaysian Energy
Company Aâ). Low helped secure Goldmanâs role in that transaction.

34. On or about January 23, 2012, Low arranged a meeting between Leissner,
Ng and a high-ranking 1MDB official. In making the arrangements, Low emailed all three at
their personal email addresses, and stated âMaking an introduction to [Leissner] and [Ng]âs
private e-mail accounts [....] Please exclude me from the e-mail list going forward.â Thereafter,
Leissner and Ng worked with the high-ranking IMDB official on the potential purchase of
Malaysian Energy Company A.

35. 1MDB was also interested in raising funds to acquire Malaysian Energy
Company A, including through a bond transaction. In or about early 2012, Leissner, Ng, IMDB
Official 1, IMDB Official 3, Low and others met in Malaysia to discuss the necessity of a
guarantee from IPIC to make the bond transaction feasible for Goldman, which would purchase
all of the bonds initially, and then sell the bonds to other investors.

36. In or about February 2012, Leissner and Ng traveled to London to meet
with Low and others to discuss the proposed bond transaction. Leissner and Ng utilized
Goldman resources to fund their travel to London.

37. At that meeting, Low explained that government officials from Abu Dhabi
and Malaysia needed to be bribed to both obtain the guarantee from IPIC and get the necessary
approvals from Malaysia and IMDB. Low advised that a high-ranking official of IPIC (âIPIC

Official 1â) and Malaysian Official 1 needed to be paid the largest bribes out of all the

12
government officials to approve the transaction, and that other lower-level officials would need
to be bribed as well.

38. Subsequently, Leissner and Ng each separately informed Employee 1
about the information they had learned at the London meeting regarding the need to bribe foreign
officials.

39. Low also promised remuneration to various |1MDB officials to facilitate
the deals and to ensure Goldmanâs role in those deals. For example, on or about March 8, 2012,
IMDB Official 1 emailed himself a copy of an online chat he had with Low on or about March
8, 2012, in which they discussed, among other things, Malaysian Energy Company A. In that
chat, Low told IMDB Official 1 that he would give IMDB Official 1 a âbig presentâ when the
Malaysian Energy Company A transaction was completed and then directed IMDB Official 1 to
âdelete from email and destroy once done.â

AO. On or about March 5, 2012, Leissner, Ng, Employee 1, Low and others
traveled to Abu Dhabi to meet with IPIC and Aabar representatives regarding the potential debt
financing that would assist 1 MDB in raising funds for the acquisition of Malaysian Energy
Company A. During the same trip, Low arranged a meeting between Leissner and IPIC
Official 1, during which Leissner delivered a letter from Malaysian Official 1 addressed to IPIC
Official 1.

Al. On or about March 19, 2012, IMDB formally chose Goldman as the âsole
bookrunner and arrangerâ for the $1.75 billion debt financing transaction designed, in part, to
pay $822 million towards Malaysian Energy Company Aâs acquisition. IPIC was chosen to
serve as guarantor on the bond and Aabar was granted certain options by the 1MDB issuer for

assistance in securing the guarantee.

13
42. One of Goldmanâs goals in pursuing this transaction was to secure more
business for itself, including a role in the potential IPO of IMDBâs energy assets, as explicitly
stated in Goldmanâs FWCC memorandum circulated during the approval process for Project
Magnolia: âPost closing, we expect significant follow on business from IMDB and IMDB
Energy[,] including the IPO of IMDB Energy.â

43. As work progressed on Project Magnolia, between on or about March 25,
2012 and on or about March 29, 2012, Leissner and Ng traveled to Los Angeles, California and
New York, New York to discuss matters related to Project Magnolia with Low and others.
Leissner and Ng traveled using Goldman resources.

44. Meanwhile, although employees within Goldmanâs control functions
suspected that Low may be involved in the deal, the only step taken by the control functions to
investigate that suspicion was to ask members of the deal team whether Low was involved and to
accept their denials without reasonable confirmation.

45. For example, during a telephone call in or about March 2012, a high-
ranking employee in BIG and MD voiced suspicions that Low was involved in Project Magnolia.
Leissner denied that Low was involved. Similarly, on or about April 3, 2012, the day before a
FWCC meeting to discuss Project Magnolia, a high-ranking executive in BIG, who was also an
advisor to the FWCC (âEmployee 2â), emailed other members of BIG that âLeissner said Jho
Low not involved at all in deal as far as he [is] aware but that Low was present when Leissner
met [IPIC Official 1] in Abu Dhabi.â

46. On or about April 4, 2012, the FWCC meeting was held, which was
attended telephonically by Goldman executives in New York, New York. During this meeting,

Leissner was asked whether Low was involved in Project Magnolia and Leissner said that, other

14
than arranging a meeting between Leissner and IPIC Official 1, Low was not involved. Ng was
also present during this meeting and did not correct Leissnerâs false statement about Lowâs
involvement. Later that same day, after the FWCC meeting, Employee 2 emailed Leissner,
stating âI was told Jho Low attended the meeting you had with [IPIC Official 1]... that was
wrong.â Leissner responded that he âhand delivered a letter by the Prime Minister of Malaysia
to [IPIC Official 1] and the Crown Prince.â Employee 2 replied, âI guess Low will have had a
hand in fixing that you were able to carry the letter from the Malaysian PM . . . Important we
have no role on our side for Low and we should ask that any payments from any of [the]
participants to any intermediaries are declared and transparent.â Leissner agreed with Employee
2âs admonishment.

47. Goldmanâs control functions accepted the statements of the deal team
members about Lowâs involvement at face value, rather than taking additional steps that
Goldmanâs control functions took in other deals, such as reviewing the electronic
communications of members of the deal team to look for evidence of Lowâs involvement (e.g.,
searching for references to Low). For example, had Goldman conducted a review of Leissnerâs
electronic communications at this time, it would have discovered multiple messages linking Low
to, among others, the bond deal, IMDB officials, Malaysian Official 1 and Abu Dhabi Official 1,
as well as the use of personal email addresses by Leissner and Ng to discuss Goldman business.

48. During this time period, Low, Leissner and Ng continued to structure the
bribery scheme. Leissner and Ng ultimately understood that Low intended to use the funds
raised through Project Magnolia to pay bribes, and cause bribes to be paid, to foreign officials in
Malaysia and Abu Dhabi to influence those officials to obtain the necessary approvals and

assistance for Goldman to execute Project Magnolia.

15
49. On or about May 16, 2012, Goldmanâs committees approved Project
Magnolia, and on or about May 21, 2012, the $1.75 billion bond issuance closed. Goldman
purchased the entire bond issuance from 1MDB.

50. On or about May 22, 2012, Goldman caused approximately $907,500,000
in proceeds from Project Magnolia to be wired to a IMDB subsidiary (âIMDB Subsidiary 1ââ),
through a correspondent bank account in New York, New York. Goldman booked
approximately $192,500,000 in fees for this bond transaction and an additional approximately
$16,800,000 in fees for advising on the acquisition of Malaysian Energy Company A.

51. Low and others caused the following transfers of funds from the proceeds
of Project Magnolia:

a. On or about May 22, 2012, approximately $576,943,490 of the
Project Magnolia bond proceeds were transferred from the account of IMDB Subsidiary | to an
account at Foreign Financial Institution A (âShell Company Account 1ââ) in the name of a
company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands with a name similar to Aabar (âShell
Company 1â). However, Shell Company 1 was not, in fact, associated with Aabar but was rather
associated with Abu Dhabi Official 1, Abu Dhabi Official 2 and Low. Abu Dhabi Official 1 and
Abu Dhabi Official 2 were signatories on Shell Company Account 1, and Low exercised control
over Shell Company Account 1.

b. On or about May 25, 2012, approximately $295 million was
transferred via wire from Shell Company Account | to an account at a foreign bank in the name
of a shell company beneficially owned and controlled by Low and Individual | (âShell Company
Account 2â). On or about July 25, 2012, another approximately $133 million was transferred via

wire from Shell Company Account | to Shell Company Account 2.

16
C. On or about June 18, 2012, approximately $133 million was
transferred from Shell Company Account | to an account at Foreign Financial Institution A,
opened in the name of a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands and beneficially
owned and controlled by a close relative of Malaysian Official 1 (âShell Company Account 3â).
Between on or about August 8, 2012 and on or about August 22, 2012, another approximately
$16 million was transferred from Shell Company Account 2 through another shell company to
Shell Company Account 3.

d. Between on or about June 20, 2012 and on or about November 20,
2012, approximately $60 million was transferred over multiple wires from Shell Company
Account 3 to the account of U.S. Motion Picture Company 1, an account at U.S. Financial
Institution | in Los Angeles, California (âHolding Company | Accountâ). U.S. Motion Picture
Company | was a U.S. legal entity owned, in part, by a close relative of Malaysian Official 1,
and the funds transferred from Shell Company Account 3 to Holding Company | Account were
used to, among other things, finance movie productions.

e. Between on or about May 29, 2012 and on or about August 1,
2012, approximately $258.75 million was transferred via wire from Shell Company Account 2 to
an account at Foreign Financial Institution B in the name of Shell Company Account 4, which
was beneficially owned and controlled by Abu Dhabi Official 1.

f. Also between on or about May 29, 2012 and on or about July 13,
2012, approximately $35 million was transferred via wire from Shell Company Account 2 to an
account at Foreign Financial Institution C in the name of Shell Company Account 5, which was

beneficially owned and controlled by Abu Dhabi Official 2.

17
g. Between on or about June 15, 2012 and on or about July 9, 2012, a
total of approximately $1.6 million was transferred from Shell Company Account 2 through
another shell company account to an account at Foreign Financial Institution D that was
beneficially owned and controlled by IMDB Official 3.

h. Between on or about June 11, 2012 and on or about July 16, 2012,
approximately $51.96 million was transferred via wire through the United States from Shell
Company Account 2 to Holding Company 2 Account, which was beneficially owned and
controlled by Leissner and his close relative, and, in turn, approximately $24.4 million was
subsequently transferred from Holding Company 2 Account to an account at Foreign Financial
Institution E beneficially owned by Ngâs relative (âShell Company Account 6â).â

Project Maximus

52. Within weeks of closing Project Magnolia, in or about May 2012, IMDB
sought assistance from Goldman to purchase a second Malaysian energy company (âMalaysian
Energy Company Bââ) and to issue a bond to raise funds for the acquisition. In or about August
2012, IMDB agreed to purchase Malaysian Energy Company B for approximately $814 million
and planned to finance the purchase with another $1.75 billion bond guaranteed indirectly by
IPIC.

53. Once again, Goldmanâs control functions simply accepted at face value
the representations of the deal team members and failed to further investigate Lowâs suspected
involvement in this bond deal. For example, on or about June 20, 2012, a member of Goldmanâs

control functions asked members of the deal team, âIs Jho Low involve[d] in this transaction?

 

? Based on records, the name of the company that held Shell Company Account 6 subsequently
changed, but Shell Company Account 6 remained beneficially owned by Ngâs relative.

18
Please also keep us posted if there are any other politically exposed person involve[d] in this
transaction in a non-official capacity.â A deal team member responded âno.â

54. Additionally, on or about October 10, 2012, in response to committee
questions, Leissner told a firmwide committee that neither Low nor any intermediary was
involved in Project Maximus. Despite their continued concern, as evidenced by their repeated
questions, Goldmanâs control functions did not engage in electronic surveillance of Leissnerâs
correspondence or activities to determine whether Low was involved in the deal.

55. Goldmanâs continued control failures were further compounded when
Goldman ignored additional red flags raised by Project Maximus, including that IMDB was
seeking to raise additional funds within a few months of raising $1.75 billion via Project
Magnolia without having utilized the full amount from that deal, and was also seeking to raise
far more than was needed to acquire Malaysian Energy Company B. Goldmanâs control
functions also failed to verify how Project Magnoliaâs proceeds were used.

56. On or about October 19, 2012, Project Maximus closed. Goldman
purchased the entire bond issuance from IMDB. On or about October 19, 2012, Goldman
caused approximately $1.64 billion to be transferred via wire through correspondent accounts in
the United States to another 1MDB subsidiary (â1 MDB Subsidiary 2â). Goldman booked
approximately $110,000,000 in fees for Project Maximus.

57. Low and others caused the following transfers of funds from the proceeds
of Project Maximus:

a. On or about October 19, 2012, approximately $790,354,855 was

transferred from 1MDB Subsidiary 2 to Shell Company Account 1.

19
b. Between on or about October 24, 2012 and on or about December
17, 2012, approximately $664 million was transferred from Shell Company Account | to Shell
Company Account 2.

C. Between on or about October 23, 2012 and on or about November
14, 2012, approximately $106.2 million was transferred from Shell Company Account | to Shell
Company Account 3, which was beneficially owned and controlled by a close relative of
Malaysian Official 1.

d. Between on or about October 30, 2012 and on or about November
19, 2012, approximately $30 million was transferred from Shell Company Account 2 to an
account held by Malaysian Official 1.

e. Between on or about October 29, 2012 and on or about November
30, 2012, approximately $214 million was transferred from Shell Company Account 2 to Shell
Company Account 4, which was beneficially owned and controlled by Abu Dhabi Official 1.

f. Between on or about July 3, 2012 and on or about December 19,
2012, approximately $21 million was transferred from Shell Company Account 2 and another
shell entity to an account beneficially owned and controlled by an official in the government of
the United Arab Emirates (âUAE Official 1ââ).

g. Between on or about November 2, 2012 and on or about January
22, 2013, approximately $31.6 million was transferred from Shell Company Account 2 to Shell
Company Account 5 and another account beneficially owned and controlled by Abu Dhabi

Official 2 and his close relative.

20
h. On or about December 6, 2012, approximately $5 million was
transferred from Shell Company Account 2 to an account beneficially owned and controlled by
IMDB Official 3.

1. Between on or about December 6, 2012 and on or about January
21, 2013, approximately $20.5 million was transferred from Shell Company Account 2 to
Holding Company 2 Account.

58. Leissner then directed follow-on transfers from Holding Company 2
Account to government officials and others. For example, on or about December 4, 2012,
Leissner emailed his close relative from his personal account with bank account details and
amounts to be wired from Holding Company 2 Account to Malaysian Official 2, IMDB Official
4 and IMDB Official 5. On or about January 15, 2013, Leissner again emailed his close relative
from his personal account, correcting some banking information and adding a transfer to 1|MDB
Official 2.

a. On or about December 7, 2012, Leissner directed approximately
$1 million to be transferred from Holding Company 2 Account to an account beneficially owned
and controlled by Malaysian Official 2.

b. Between on or about December 7, 2012 and on or about December
20, 2012, Leissner directed approximately $700,000 to be transferred from Holding Company 2
Account to an account beneficially owned and controlled by 1MDB Official 5 and his close
relative.

C. On or about December 20, 2012, Leissner directed approximately
$1 million to be transferred from Holding Company 2 Account to an account beneficially owned

and controlled by 1MDB Official 1.

21
d. Also on or about January 17, 2013, Leissner directed
approximately $1 million to be transferred from Holding Company 2 Account to an account
beneficially owned and controlled by IMDB Official 4.

e. On or about January 17, 2013, Leissner directed approximately $1
million to be transferred from Holding Company 2 Account to an account beneficially owned
and controlled by 1MDB Official 2.

Project Catalyze

59. In or about November 2012, almost immediately after Project Maximus
closed, Leissner* and Low began working on another bond issuance. Ultimately, Goldman
underwrote a third bond issuance that raised an additional $3 billion for IMDB with Goldman
acting as arranger and underwriter. This bond issuance was purportedly intended to fund
1MDBâs portion of a joint venture with Aabar.

60. Goldmanâs control functions had continued suspicions that Low was
working on the third bond deal. Once again, however, the control functions relied solely on the
deal team membersâ denials of Lowâs involvement without any further scrutiny.

61. On or about April 24, 2013, a senior Goldman executive who was a
member of Goldmanâs approval committee located in New York, New York, emailed Leissner
about âIMDB,â asking: âIs there a story circulating about an intermediary on the Magnolia
trades??â Leissner responded, âNot that I am aware of .. . There definitely was no intermediary
on any of the trades. The blogs in Malaysia always try to link a young Chinese business man

[sic], Jho Low, to IMDB. That is not the case other than he was an advisor alongside other

 

3 Ng had a new position within Goldman by this time and did not work directly on the deal team
for Project Catalyze, but was recognized by Goldman as a continued contact point for IMDB.

22
prominent figures to the King of Malaysia at the time of the creation of IMDB.â There was no
follow-up by Goldmanâs control functions about Low.

62. Goldman also failed to address the other red flags that were raised by the
proposed $3 billion transaction, including, once again, IMDB raising large sums of money with
no identified use of proceeds within months of Project Magnolia and Project Maximus, and
Goldmanâs failure to verify use of past bond proceeds. Adding to the transactionâs risks was the
upcoming Malaysian general election, which directly affected the political future of Malaysian
Official 1.

63. Goldmanâs committees nevertheless approved Project Catalyze on or
about March 13, 2013, and the proceeds from Project Catalyze were issued on or about March
19, 2013. Goldman purchased the entire bond issuance from IMDB and booked approximately
$279,000,000 in fees on Project Catalyze.

64. Low and Leissner continued to pay bribes to government officials from
the bond proceeds. On or about March 19, 2013, Goldman transferred via wire from and through
the United States approximately $2.7 billion from Project Catalyze to an account for another
IMDB subsidiary (âIMDB Subsidiary 3â) at Foreign Financial Institution A. Subsequently,
Low caused approximately $1,440,188,045 to be transferred through a series of pass-through
accounts to accounts beneficially owned or controlled by Low and Individual 1. Low then
directed multiple transfers to various government officials, including:

a. On or about March 21, 2013, approximately $620 million was
transferred from a shell entity beneficially owned or controlled by Low, Shell Company Account

7, to an account beneficially owned and controlled by Malaysian Official 1. Four days later, on

23
or about March 25, 2013, another approximately $61 million was transferred from Shell
Company Account 7 to the same account for Malaysian Official 1.

b. On or about April 5, 2013, approximately $10 million was
transferred from Shell Company Account 8, an account beneficially owned and controlled by
Low, to an account beneficially owned and controlled by Abu Dhabi Official 2.

C. On or about July 1, 2013, approximately $1 million was transferred
from Shell Company Account 8 to an account beneficially owned and controlled by IMDB
Official 5.

d. On or about October 21, 2013, approximately $11.5 million was
transferred from Shell Company Account 8 to Shell Company Account 3.

e. On or about September 11, 2013, approximately $1 million was
transferred from Shell Company Account 8 to an account beneficially owned and controlled by
IMDB Official 1.

f. On or about September 11, 2013, approximately $1 million was
transferred from Shell Company Account 8 to an account beneficially owned and controlled by
Malaysian Official 2.

g. On or about September 11, 2013, approximately $980,000 was
transferred from Shell Company Account 8 to an account beneficially owned and controlled by
Malaysian Official 3.

h. On or about September 11, 2013, approximately $895,000 was
transferred from Shell Company Account 8 to an account beneficially owned and controlled by

Malaysian Official 4.

24
1. On or about July 3, 2013, approximately $65.1 million was
transferred from Shell Company Account 8 to Holding Company 2 Account. From there,
Leissner directed payment of approximately $4.2 million to Shell Company Account 6, which
was beneficially owned by Ngâs close relative.

j. On or about July 29, 2013, approximately $1 million was
transferred from Holding Company 2 Account to an account beneficially owned and controlled
by IMDB Official 2.

k. Also on or about July 29, 2013, approximately $1 million was
transferred from Holding Company 2 Account to an account beneficially owned and controlled
by IMDB Official 4.

L. On or about July 19, 2013, approximately $6 million was
transferred from Holding Company 2 Account to another account beneficially owned and
controlled by Leissner and his close relative, Management Company | Account. Subsequently,
on or about July 22, 2013, approximately $6 million was transferred from Management
Company | Account to an account beneficially owned and controlled by IMDB Official 3.

m. On or about June 27, 2013, Low transferred approximately $30
million from an account he beneficially owned and controlled to an account beneficially owned
and controlled by UAE Official 1.

Other Anticipated IMDB Deals
65. After the bond deals were complete, Goldman continued to pursue IMDB
business, including a role in the anticipated IMDB Energy IPO. In the pursuit of that additional
business, in or about September 2013, Goldman hosted a roundtable in New York for Malaysian

Official 1. Several senior Goldman executives, Leissner, Low, IMDB Official 3 and others were

25
scheduled to attend this meeting, though Low did not ultimately attend. However, during that
trip, a New York jeweler (âJeweler 1â) met with Low and the wife of Malaysian Official 1 ina
hotel suite at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in New York, New York, to show the wife of
Malaysian Official 1 a piece of expensive jewelry that Jeweler 1 had designed for her at Lowâs
request.

66. On or about January 13, 2014, IMDB invited Goldman to submit a
proposal to provide services to IMDB in connection with the IPO. Goldman worked on the
proposed IPO through 2014, during which time Low and Leissner continued to make or promise
corrupt payments to government officials, including from Project Catalyzeâs misappropriated
proceeds.

67. On or about June 2, 2014, Leissner sent an email to himself at his personal
email account containing a chat between himself and Low in which the two discussed IMDB
business opportunities that Goldman was trying to win at the time, including the IPO.
Specifically, they discussed how to manage officials at IMDB to steer additional business to
Goldman, including getting Goldman to serve as a Joint Global Coordinator for the IPO.

a. For example, Low stated that IMDB Official 2 and another high-
ranking IMDB official were unhappy with Goldman for not âdeliver[ing]ââ a loan to IMDB in
2013, which was ultimately provided by Foreign Financial Institution F. As a result, according
to Low, IMDB would only give Goldman a more limited role in the IPO. Leissner responded
that he âwould have deliveredâ the loan, and expressed frustration that Goldman was concerned
about issues related to IMDBâs delayed financial reporting at the time, declaring âCommittee is

stupid!!!â

26
b. Low and Leissner then agreed that Leissner would âbabysitâ
IMDB Official 2 and the high-ranking IMDB official, and Low would âmanage via [IMDB
Board of Directors]. Leissner also noted that neither named official provided âmuch of valueâ
but that they âneed[ed] to suck up to them.â

C. Low and Leissner also discussed sending âcakesâ to âmadam bossââ
and Low asked if he could transfer money to Management Company 1 Account so that Leissner
could âsettle madam cakes 2.â Low asked Leissner, âDo u mind if funds go [from] [Shell
Company 1] to u [sic] direct at [Management Company 1]? Or u [sic] think too sensitive?â
Leissner responded, â[Shell Company 1] is ok too. But need to get it out asap. Best today.
Because I am seriously in trouble.â

d. Low and Leissner further discussed Leissnerâs continued efforts to
onboard Low as a formal Goldman client. Leissner explained he would âpush harderâ for Low
once Leissner was confirmed as Goldmanâs Southeast Asia Chairman of the Investment Banking
Division.

68. On or about June 2, 2014, approximately $1.215 million was transferred
from Shell Company Account 8 to Management Company | Account.

69. On or about October 10, 2014, Leissner caused approximately $4.1
million to be transferred from Management Company | Account to Jeweler | in New York, New
York, in part to pay for approximately $1.3 million in jewelry that had been purchased on or
about January 3, 2014 by the wife of Malaysian Official | while she, Malaysian Official 1 and

Low were in the United States.

27
70. On or about October 14, 2014, Leissner transferred approximately
$600,000 from Holding Company 2 Account to an account beneficially owned and controlled by
Abu Dhabi Official 2 and his close relative.

71. Also on or about October 14, 2014, Leissner transferred approximately
$3.5 million from Holding Company 2 Account to the business account of an associate of
Malaysian Official 1âs relative.

Additional Failures of Goldmanâs Control Functions

72. After the bond deals were completed, in or about and between March 2013
and February 2016, additional red flags were raised in the press and on internal phone calls
among Goldmanâs employees and executives about Lowâs involvement in the deals and the
possible payment of bribes in connection with the deals. Goldman failed to investigate these red
flags or to perform an internal review of its role in the bond deals despite the clear implication
that the deals had involved criminal wrongdoing. Further, high ranking employees of Goldman
failed to escalate concerns about bribery and other criminal conduct related to the bond deals
pursuant to Goldmanâs escalation policy, which required that any Goldman employee who
became aware of any conduct that could raise, among others, ââa legal, compliance, reputational,
ethical, accounting, [or] internal accounting controlâ issue to report such conduct immediately to
a supervisor and Goldmanâs control functions.

73. Specifically, in or about May 2013, a Goldman PMD (âEmployee 3â) who
had been involved in the IMDB deals, discussed the deals in a series of phone calls with
Goldman senior executives that were recorded on Goldman phone lines. For example, on or
about May 8, 2013, Employee 3 called a senior Goldman executive about, among other things,

Project Catalyze. Employee 3 stated, âthe main reason for the delay for [IPIC] not having

28
funded their three billion into the JV with IMDB is [Abu Dhabi Official 1] is trying to get
something on the side in his pocket.â He continued later, âI think itâs quite disturbing to have
come across this piece of information... .â The senior Goldman executive replied, âWhatâs
disturbing about that? Itâs nothing new, is it?â In response, Employee 3 agreed that the situation
was nothing new. Employee 3 had at least one substantially similar phone conversation with at
least one other senior Goldman executive.

74. Subsequently, in May 2015 and again in October 2015, amid negative
media reporting linking Low with the IMDB bond deals and Malaysian Official 1, Goldman
executives and employees discussed Lowâs involvement in the [MDB deals. For example, ona
recorded call on or about October 13, 2015, Employee 3 told the senior Goldman executive that a
senior IPIC officer had informed his subordinate that âthere are a number of key people who are
involved in, letâs call it the situation. [Abu Dhabi Official 1] is one. Jho Low for sure. He
thinks Jho Low is the leader of the pack. And he has a very strong view that [Leissner] is
involved.â The control functions never took steps to address these red flags.

75. There were also subsequent emails and recorded phone calls between
Employee 3 and senior Goldman executives in the control functions about the disparity between
how due diligence and risk issues were handled on various deals. In particular, they discussed
the unusual latitude granted to certain employees, such as Leissner and Employee 1.

76. For example, in or about January 2016, on a recorded call between
Employee 2, who had been involved in BIGâs review of each of the relevant transactions, and
Employee 3, they discussed, among other things, Leissnerâs conduct, including Leissnerâs false
statements that Low was not involved in the IMDB deals. Employee 2 then noted that there

were several similarly âproblematicâ people from a compliance perspective at Goldman, and

29
Employee 3 agreed, immediately mentioning Employee | as an example of a âproblematicâ
person. Employee 3 also noted the âdouble standardâ between the minor repercussions meted
out to favored employees like Leissner and Employee | when they got caught trying to
circumvent the control functions, and the more serious repercussions to other, less favored
employees who engaged in similar behavior. Employee 2 agreed, stating, âYes, double standard,
and it looks stupid.ââ In the course of the call, Employee 2 also noted that Leissnerâs email
communications had been searched as part of an internal investigation into a separate incident
involving the use of an intermediary that occurred subsequent to the IMDB deals, which
Employee 2 stated âseems to me should have been done ages ago.ââ Employee 3 similarly
discussed on a recorded call in or about February 2016 with a high-ranking employee in
compliance and MD how repercussions for control functions violations varied radically between
deals.

Goldmanâs Other Low-Related Deals and Contacts

77. The IMDB bond deals and underlying acquisitions were not the only
Low-related transactions that Goldman engaged in during the relevant period. Despite the
negative view that Goldmanâs control functions took of Low, there were numerous potential and
completed deals with which Low was involved in some manner.

78. For example, Goldman served as an advisor on a deal in or about 2013
where a Low-related entity was one of the original clients. The deal was not submitted for due
diligence review until it was substantially finalized. At that point, BIG raised concerns about the
involvement of the Low-related entity and advised the deal team that the deal should not proceed
if Low was involved as a client, received a fee or had an active role in the deal. Through his

relationship with Abu Dhabi Official 1, Low arranged for another entity to become Goldmanâs

30
putative client. However, Low remained in the deal as a co-investor and an active participant.
Goldman deal team members knew this was merely a technical change in the deal structure, and
knew but did not inform BIG of Lowâs continued involvement in the deal. BIG employees were
later surprised to see press reports that the deal had been completed with Lowâs involvement in
late 2013. The deal resulted in a multi-million dollar fee for Goldman. Goldmanâs control
functions performed no additional review after the deal was completed.

79. In addition, senior executives at Goldman had continuing contact with
Low during the relevant period. These contacts included, but were not limited to, a meeting in or
about 2009 between a senior Goldman executive and PMD and Malaysian Official | that was
arranged by Low; a meeting in or about 2012 that was attended by a Goldman senior executive,
Abu Dhabi Official 2 and Low, among others; and a meeting on a yacht in Southern France in or
about 2013 attended by another senior Goldman executive and PMD, Leissner, Malaysian

Official 1 and Low, among others.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Thursday, October 22, 2020

Goldman Sachs Charged in Foreign Bribery Case and Agrees to Pay Over $2.9 Billion

The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (Goldman Sachs or the Company), a global financial institution headquartered in New York, New York, and
Goldman Sachs (Malaysia) Sdn. Bhd. (GS Malaysia), its Malaysian subsidiary, have admitted to conspiring to violate the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act (FCPA) in connection with a scheme to pay over $1 billion in bribes to Malaysian and Abu Dhabi officials to obtain lucrative
business for Goldman Sachs, including its role in underwriting approximately $6.5 billion in three bond deals for 1Malaysia Development Bhd.
(1MDB), for which the bank earned hundreds of millions in fees. Goldman Sachs will pay more than $2.9 billion as part of a coordinated
resolution with criminal and civil authorities in the United States, the United Kingdom, Singapore, and elsewhere.

Goldman Sachs entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the department in connection with a criminal information filed today in the
Eastern District of New York charging the Company with conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA. GS Malaysia pleaded
guilty in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York to a one-count criminal information charging it with conspiracy to violate the
anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA.

Previously, Tim Leissner, the former Southeast Asia Chairman and participating managing director of Goldman Sachs, pleaded guilty to
conspiring to launder money and to violate the FCPA. Ng Chong Hwa, also known as âRoger Ng,â former managing director of Goldman and
head of investment banking for GS Malaysia, has been charged with conspiring to launder money and to violate the FCPA. Ng was extradited
from Malaysia to face these charges and is scheduled to stand trial in March 2021. The cases are assigned to U.S. District Judge Margo K.
Brodie of the Eastern District of New York.

In addition to these criminal charges, the department has recovered, or assisted in the recovery of, in excess of $1 billion in assets for Malaysia
associated with and traceable to the 1MDB money laundering and bribery scheme.

âGoldman Sachs today accepted responsibility for its role in a conspiracy to bribe high-ranking foreign officials to obtain lucrative

underwriting and other business relating to 1MDB,â said Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian C. Rabbitt of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal
Division. âTodayâs resolution, which requires Goldman Sachs to admit wrongdoing and pay nearly three billion dollars in penalties, fines, and
disgorgement, holds the bank accountable for this criminal scheme and demonstrates the departmentâs continuing commitment

to combatting corruption and protecting the U.S. financial system.â

âOver a period of five years, Goldman Sachs participated in a sweeping international corruption scheme, conspiring to avail itself of more than
$1.6 billion in bribes to multiple high-level government officials across several countries so that the company could reap hundreds of millions of
dollars in fees, all to the detriment of the people of Malaysia and the reputation of American financial institutions operating abroad,â said Acting
U.S. Attorney Seth D. DuCharme of the Eastern District of New York. âTodayâs resolution, which includes a criminal guilty plea by Goldman
Sachsâ subsidiary in Malaysia, demonstrates that the department will hold accountable any institution that violates U.S. law anywhere in the
world by unfairly tilting the scales through corrupt practices.â

âWhen government officials and business executives secretly work together behind the scenes for their own illegal benefit, and not that of their
citizens and shareholders, their behavior lends credibility to the narrative that businesses donât succeed based on the quality of their products,
but rather their willingness to play dirty,â said Assistant Director in Charge William F. Sweeney Jr. of the FBIâs New York Field Office. âGreed
eventually exacts an immense cost on society, and unchecked corrupt behavior erodes trust in public institutions and government entities alike.
This case represents the largest ever penalty paid to U.S. authorities in an FCPA case. Our investigation into the looting of funds from 1MDB
remains ongoing. If anyone has information that could assist the case, call us at 1-800-CALLFBI.â

âIMDB was established to drive strategic initiatives for the long-term economic development of Malaysia. Goldman Sachs admitted today that
one billion dollars of the money earmarked to help the people of Malaysia was actually diverted and used to pay bribes to Malaysian and Abu
Dhabi officials to obtain their business,â said Special Agent in Charge Ryan L. Korner of IRS Criminal Investigationâs (IRS-Cl) Los Angeles Field
Office. âTodayâs guilty pleas demonstrate that the law applies to everyone, including large investment banks like Goldman Sachs. IRS Criminal
Investigation will work tirelessly alongside our law enforcement partners to identify and bring to justice those who engage in fraud and deceit
around the globe. When the American financial system is misused for corruption, the IRS will take notice and we will take action.â

According to Goldmanâs admissions and court documents, between approximately 2009 and 2014, Goldman conspired with others to violate the
FCPA by engaging in a scheme to pay more than $1.6 billion in bribes, directly and indirectly, to foreign officials in Malaysia and Abu Dhabi in
order to obtain and retain business for Goldman from 1MDB, a Malaysian state-owned and state-controlled fund created to pursue investment
and development projects for the economic benefit of Malaysia and its people. Specifically, the Company admitted to engaging in the bribery
scheme through certain of its employees and agents, including Leissner, Ng, and a former executive who was a participating managing director
and held leadership positions in Asia (Employee 1), in exchange for lucrative business and other advantages and opportunities. These included,
among other things, securing Goldmanâs role as an advisor on energy acquisitions, as underwriter on three lucrative bond deals with a total
value of $6.5 billion, and a potential role in a highly anticipated and even more lucrative initial public offering for 1MDBâs energy assets. As
Goldman admitted â and as alleged in the indictment pending in the Eastern District of New York against Ng and Low â in furtherance of the
scheme, Leissner, Ng, Employee 1, and others conspired to pay bribes to numerous foreign officials, including high-ranking officials in the
Malaysian government, 1MDB, Abu Dhabiâs state-owned and state-controlled sovereign wealth fund, International Petroleum Investment
Company (IPIC), and Abu Dhabiâs state-owned and state-controlled joint stock company, Aabar Investments PJS (Aabar).

Goldman admitted today that, in order to effectuate the scheme, Leissner, Ng, Employee 1, and others conspired with Low Taek |ho, aka Jho
Low, to promise and pay over $1.6 billion in bribes to Malaysian, 1MDB, IPIC, and Aabar officials. The co-conspirators allegedly paid these
bribes using more than $2.7 billion in funds that Low, Leissner, and other members of the conspiracy diverted and misappropriated from the
bond offerings underwritten by Goldman. Leissner, Ng and Low also retained a portion of the misappropriated funds for themselves and other
co-conspirators. Goldman admitted that, through Leissner, Ng, Employee 1 and others, the bank used Lowâs connections to advance and
further the bribery scheme, ultimately ensuring that IMDB awarded Goldman a role on three bond transactions between 2012 and 2013, known
internally at Goldman as âProject Magnolia,â âProject Maximus,â and âProject Catalyze.â

Goldman also admitted that, although employees serving as part of Goldmanâs control functions knew that any transaction involving Low posed
a significant risk, and although they were on notice that Low was involved in the transactions, they did not take reasonable steps to ensure that
Low was not involved. Goldman further admitted that there were significant red flags raised during the due diligence process and afterward â
including but not limited to Lowâs involvement â that either were ignored or only nominally addressed so that the transactions would be
approved and Goldman could continue to do business with 1MDB. As a result of the scheme, Goldman received approximately $606 million in
fees and revenue, and increased its stature and presence in Southeast Asia.

Under the terms of the agreements, Goldman will pay a criminal penalty and disgorgement of over $2.9 billion. Goldman also has reached
separate parallel resolutions with foreign authorities in the United Kingdom, Singapore, Malaysia, and elsewhere, along with domestic
authorities in the United States. The department will credit over $1.6 billion in payments with respect to those resolutions.

The department reached this resolution with Goldman based on a number of factors, including the Companyâs failure to voluntarily disclose the
conduct to the department; the nature and seriousness of the offense, which included the involvement of high-level employees within the
Companyâs investment bank and others who ignored significant red flags; the involvement of various Goldman subsidiaries across the world;
the amount of the bribes, which totaled over $1.6 billion; the number and high-level nature of the bribe recipients, which included at least 11
foreign officials, including high-ranking officials of the Malaysian government; and the significant amount of actual loss incurred by IMDB as a
result of the co-conspiratorsâ conduct. Goldman received partial credit for its cooperation with the departmentâs investigation, but did not
receive full credit for cooperation because it significantly delayed producing relevant evidence, including recorded phone calls in which the
Companyâs bankers, executives, and control function personnel discussed allegations of bribery and misconduct relating to the conduct in the
statement of facts. Accordingly, the total criminal penalty reflects a 10 percent reduction off the bottom of the applicable U.S. sentencing
guidelines fine range.

Low has also been indicted for conspiracy to commit money laundering and violate the FCPA, along with Ng, E.D.N.Y. Docket No. 18-CR-538
(MKB). Low remains a fugitive. The charges in the indictment as to Low and Ng are merely allegations, and those defendants are presumed
innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.

The investigation was conducted by the FBIâs International Corruption Unit and IRS-Cl. The prosecution is being handled by the Criminal
Divisionâs Fraud Section and the Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section (MLARS), and the Business and Securities Fraud Section of the
U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York. Trial Attorneys Katherine Nielsen, Nikhila Raj, Jennifer E. Ambuehl, Woo S. Lee, Mary
Ann McCarthy, Leo Tsao, and David Last of the Criminal Division, and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jacquelyn M. Kasulis, Alixandra Smith and Drew
Rolle of the Eastern District of New York are prosecuting the case. Additional Criminal Division Trial Attorneys and Assistant U.S. Attorneys
within U.S. Attorneyâs Offices for the Eastern District of New York and Central District of California have provided valuable assistance with
various aspects of this investigation, including with civil and criminal forfeitures. The Justice Departmentâs Office of International Affairs of the
Criminal Division provided critical assistance in this case.

The department also appreciates the significant assistance provided by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission; the Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System, including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York; the New York State Department of Financial Services, the
United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority; the United Kingdom Prudential Regulation Authority; the Attorney Generalâs Chambers of
Singapore; the Singapore Police Force-Commercial Affairs Division; the Monetary Authority of Singapore; the Office of the Attorney General and
the Federal Office of Justice of Switzerland; the judicial investigating authority of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and the Criminal Investigation
Department of the Grand-Ducal Police of Luxembourg; the Attorney Generalâs Chambers of Malaysia; the Royal Malaysian Police; and the
Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission. The department also expresses its appreciation for the assistance provided by the Ministry of Justice of
France; the Attorney General's Office of the Bailiwick of Guernsey and the Guernsey Economic Crime Division.

The Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice Departmentâs FCPA
enforcement efforts can be found at www.justice.gov/criminal-fraud/foreign-corrupt-practices-act.

MLARS'âs Bank Integrity Unit investigates and prosecutes banks and other financial institutions, including their officers, managers, and
employees, whose actions threaten the integrity of the individual institution or the wider financial system.

MLARSâs Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative, in partnership with federal law enforcement agencies, and often with U.S. Attorney's Offices,
seeks to forfeit the proceeds of foreign official corruption and, where appropriate, to use those recovered assets to benefit the people harmed
by these acts of corruption and abuse of office.
