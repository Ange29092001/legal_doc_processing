ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFFâS EX PARTE
MOTION FOR STATUTORY RESTRAINING ORDER AND SCHEDULING
PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION HEARING

THIS CAUSE is before the Court on Plaintiff's Ex Parte Motion for Statutory
Restraining Order and Motion for Preliminary Injunction (Doc. S-4; Motion), filed on
January 5, 2015. Simultaneously with the Motion, the United States Commodity Futures
Trading Commission (Plaintiff or CFTC) filed a Complaint for Injunctive Relief, Civil
Monetary Penalty, and Other Equitable Relief (Doc. S-3) against Defendants Allied Markets
LLC, Joshua Gilliland, and Chawalit Wongkhiao (collectively, Defendants). In the Motion,
the CFTC moves, pursuant to Section 6c(a) of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), 7
U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(a) (2012), for an ex parte statutory restraining order freezing assets and
prohibiting the destruction of books, records, or other documents; and for an order requiring

Defendants to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not issue.
 

 

 

The Court has considered the pleadings, declarations, exhibits, and memorandum
filed in support of the CFTCâs Motion, and now, being fully advised, finds as follows:

l. The Court possesses jurisdiction over the parties and over the subject matter
of this action pursuant to Section 6c of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2012).

om Venue properly lies in this District, pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the CEA,
7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(e) (2012).

as There is good cause to believe that Defendant Allied Markets LLC (âAllied
Marketsâ), by and through its agents, principals and control persons, Defendants Joshua
Gilliland and Chawalit Wongkhiao have engaged in, are engaging in, and may continue to
engage in violations of Sections 2(c)(2)(C)Gii)(D(cc), 4b(a)(2)(A) and (C), 4k(2), 4m(1), and
40(1) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 2(c)(2)(C)Gu)(D(cc), 6b(a)(2)(A), (C), 6k(2), 6m(1), 60(1)
(2012); and CFTC Regulations 3.12, 4.20(a)-(c), 4.41(a), 5.2(b)(1) and (3), 5.3(a)(2)@), and
5.3(a)(2)(ii), 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 3.12, 4.20(a)-(c), 4.41 (a), 5.2(b)(1), (3), 5.3(a)(2)G), (41) (2014).

4, The CFTC has presented evidence that, since at least January 2012,
Defendants fraudulently solicited more than $1 million from members of the public to
participate in a supposed commodity pool purportedly trading leveraged or margined retail
off-exchange foreign currency contracts, commonly known as âforex.â The CFTC has also
presented evidence that Defendants misappropriated pool participantsâ funds to pay
Defendants Gillilandâs and Wongkhiaoâs personal expenses. Additionally, the CFTC has
presented evidence that Defendants failed to register with the CFTC as required, failed to

segregate customer funds, and failed to operate the commodity pool as a separate entity, and
 

 

failed to accurately report or disclose the performance of the relevant investments, as
required by the CEA and CFTC Regulations.

Â» There is good cause to believe that immediate and irreparable damage to the
Courtâs ability to grant effective final relief in the form of monetary redress will occur from
the sale, transfer, assignment, or other disposition by Defendants of assets or records unless
Defendants are immediately restrained and enjoined by order of this Court;

6. There is good cause for entry of an order freezing assets owned, controlled,
managed, or held by or on behalf of, or for the benefit of, Defendants.

7: There is good cause for entry of an order prohibiting Defendants, their agents,
servants, employees, assigns, attorneys, and persons in active concert or participation with
Defendants, including any successor thereof, from destroying records and/or denying agents
of the CFTC immediate and complete access to Defendantsâ books and records for inspection
and copying.

8. Absent the entry of this order, Defendants would have the ability to dissipate
or transfer assets and destroy books and records.

9. An ex parte statutory restraining order is warranted here to preserve the status
quo, protect customers from loss and damage, and enable the CFTC to fulfill its statutory
duties.

Accordingly, it is ORDERED:

10. âPlaintiff's Ex Parte Motion for Statutory Restraining Order and Motion for
Preliminary Injunction (Doc. S-4) is GRANTED, in part, and TAKEN UNDER

ADVISEMENT, in part.
A. To the extent the CFTC requests an ex parte statutory restraining order,
the Motion is GRANTED as set forth below.
B. To the extent the CFTC requests the entry of a preliminary injunction, the
Motion is TAKEN UNDER ADVISEMENT.

absent further order,â the hearing will be limited to the written submissions and arguments of
counsel.

24. In issuing this Statutory Restraining Order, the Court understands that
Defendants have not yet been given an opportunity to be heard and emphasizes that it is not
making a final decision on any request for preliminary injunctive relief. However, the Court
is persuaded that issuing the Statutory Restraining Order until a full hearing can be held on

the CFTCâs request for preliminary injunctive relief is the lawful and proper action.

evidentiary hearing must be held... . [W]here material facts are not in dispute, or where facts in dispute are not
material to the preliminary injunction sought, district courts need not hold an evidentiary hearing.â) In the
event either party believes such a hearing is warranted in this action, the party must, after conferring with
opposing counsel, file a motion requesting an evidentiary hearing and identifying the factual issues or dispute
which necessitate such relief,

Federal Court in Florida Enters Order Freezing Assets in CFTC Foreign Currency Anti-
Fraud Action against Allied Markets LLC and its Principals Joshua Gilliland and Chawalit
Wongkhiao

CFIC Charges Jacksonville, Florida, Defendants with Operating a
Fraudulent Forex Pool and Misappropriating Customer Funds to Pay
Personal Expenses

Washington, DC â The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced that it filed a civil
enforcement Complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, charging Defendants Allied Markets
LLC, and its principals Joshua Gilliland and Chawalit Wongkhiao, all of Jacksonville, Florida, with operating a
fraudulent foreign currency (forex) commodity pool in violation of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC
Regulations. In addition, none of the Defendants has ever been registered with the CFTC, as required.

On January 7, 2015, the day after the CFTC Complaint was filed under seal, U.S. District Judge Marcia Morales Howard
issued an emergency Order freezing and preserving assets under the Defendantsâ control and prohibiting them from
destroying documents or denying CFTC staff access to their books and records. The Court has scheduled a hearing for
January 21, 2015, on the CFTCâs motion for a preliminary injunction.

The CFTC Complaint charges that, as early as January 2012, the Defendants fraudulently solicited more than $1 million
from members of the public to trade forex in a commodity pool. As alleged, Defendants Gilliland and Wongkhiao
misappropriated funds to pay their personal expenses. For example, instead of trading forex as promised, they allegedly
withdrew approximately $850,000 in pool participant funds from the Allied Markets forex account, spending more than
$64,000 of the stolen funds on restaurants and entertainment; approximately $33,000 on travel, hotels and rental cars;
and approximately $66,000 on rent for their residence in Jacksonville Beach, Florida. They also transferred at least
$83,200 to their personal bank accounts and withdrew approximately $139,000 in cash from automated teller machines
and at bank branches, the Complaint charges.

Defendants also used pool participant funds to pay purported trading profits and supposedly returned pool participantsâ
principal in the manner of a Ponzi scheme, according to the Complaint.

Specifically, according to the Complaint, the Defendants solicited members of the public to send them money for forex
trading by fraudulently guaranteeing specific trading returns and by making material misrepresentations regarding their
trading expertise and results, including that Defendantsâ forex trading was generating large profits.

In its continuing litigation, the CFTC seeks full restitution to defrauded pool participants, disgorgement of any ill-gotten
gains, a civil monetary penalty, permanent registration and trading bans, and a permanent injunction against future
violations of the CEA and CFTC Regulations, as charged.

The CFTC appreciates the assistance of the Jacksonville Beach Police Department, the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office, the
Florida Office of Financial Regulation, the United States Marshals Service, and the National Futures Association.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this action are Jonah McCarthy, Patricia Gomersall, Dmitriy
Vilenskiy, Jonathan Robell, John Einstman, and Paul Hayeck.

DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY

 

UNITED STATES COMMODITY FUTURES
TRADING COMMISSION,

Plaintiff, Civil No. 13-5755 (NLH/JS)
Vv. FINAL ORDER OF DEFAULT
JUDGMENT AS TO DEFENDANTS
MICHAEL J. SIEGEL, et al., MICHAEL J. SIEGEL, TOTE
FUND LLC AND MJS CAPITAL
Defendants. MANAGEMENT LLC

 

HILLMAN, District Judge

 

On September 27, 2013, the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission (hereafter, âCommissionâ) filed a complaint against
Defendants Michael J. Siegel, TOTE Fund LLC (hereafter, âTOTEâ)
and MJS Capital Management LLC (hereafter, âMJSâ) seeking
injunctive and other equitable relief, as well as the imposition
of restitution and civil monetary penalties, for violations of
the Commodity Exchange Act, as amended (âActâ), 7 U.S.C. 8Â§ 1 et
seg. (2002), and the Commissionâs Regulations promulgated
thereunder, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1 et seg. (2004).

Defendants failed to respond to the complaint, and the
Commission thus requested a Clerkâs entry of default on January
31, 2014. Thereafter, Defendants having failed to seek to

vacate the entry of default, the Commission filed the present

 
Case 1:13-cv-05755-NLH-JS Document 12 Filed 12/30/14 Page 2 of 39 PagelD: 245

motion for default judgment. The Court, having carefully
considered the complaint, the allegations of which are well-
pleaded and hereby taken as true, the Commissionâs motion for
entry of default judgment, and the Declaration of Kara L. Mucha,
Futures Trading Investigator for the Commission (hereafter,
âMucha Decl.â), finds that there is good cause for the entry of
this Final Order of Default Judgment as to Defendants Siegel,
TOTE, and MJS and that there is no just reason for delay.

Therefore, on this 30th day of December, 2014, the Court:

GRANTS the Commissionâs motion [Doc. No. 11] for judgment
of default as to Defendants Siegel, TOTE and MJS;

ORDERS the entry of the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of
Law set forth below; and

GRANTS the Commissionâs requests for relief, as set forth
below.
qr. FINDINGS OF FACT

The Court hereby finds as follows:

A. The Parties

1, The Commission is an independent federal
regulatory agency charged with the responsibility for
administering and enforcing the provisions of the Act and the
Regulations promulgated under it. (Compl. @ 12.)
2. Defendant TOTE was a Delaware limited liability

company with its principal place of business in Los Angeles,

 
Case 1:13-cv-05755-NLH-JS Document 12 Filed 12/30/14 Page 3 of 39 PagelD: 246

California. TOTE served as the commodity pool operator
(hereafter, âCPOâ) for a commodity pool, the Monarch Futures
Fund LLC (hereafter, âMonarchâ), from August 2007 through at
least October 2010. TOTE acted as the manager of Monarch. (Id.
(J 13, 16, 18.)

3. Defendant MJS was a Delaware limited liability
company with its principal place of business in Los Angeles,
California. MJS served as the CPO for a commodity pool, the QEP
Futures Fund LLC (hereafter, âQEPâ), from August 2008 through at
least October 2010. MJS acted as the manager of QEP. (Id. V1
14, 16, 20.)

4. Defendant Siegel is an individual who resides in
Northfield, New Jersey. Siegel is the chief executive officer
and sole principal of both TOTE and MJS, and was responsible for

the day-to-day operations of TOTE and MJS. Siegel controlled

the operations of TOTE including controlling its bank accounts,

and distributing all promotional materials. (Id. @ 15.)
B. Siegelâs Formation and Operation of the Monarch and
QEP Pools
5. In August 2007, Siegel formed Monarch as a

vehicle for trading futures contracts using an automated trading
system he developed called MX2. In August 2008, Siegel formed

QEP for the same purpose. (Id. @ 16.)

 
Case 1:13-cv-05755-NLH-JS Document 12 Filed 12/30/14 Page 4 of 39 PagelD: 247

6. Siegel solicited pool participants for Monarch
and QEP from among students and family members of students he
taught to trade using his MX2 trading program, which
computerized Siegelâs trading philosophy. (Id. @ 17.)

7. Approximately ten individuals and one entity
placed funds totaling $400,000 with Monarch. (Id. @@ 19.)

8. TOTE filed a Notice of Claim Exemption from
Commodity Pool Operator registration pursuant to Commission
Regulation 4.13(a) (2), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 4.13(a) (2) (2007), with
reference to Monarch, which is listed as a commodity pool
operated by TOTE. (Id. 7 18; see also Mucha Decl., Ex. A.)

9. Three individuals placed funds totaling
approximately $975,000 with QEP. (Compl. @ 21.)

10. MJS filed a Notice of Claim Exemption from
Commodity Pool Operator registration pursuant to Commission
Regulation 4.13(a) (4), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 4.13(a) (4) (2007), with
reference to QEP, which is listed as a commodity pool operated
by MJS. (Id. @ 20; see also Mucha Decl., Ex. B.)

11. Defendants used the mails or other
instrumentalities of interstate commerce by, inter alia, using
the United States Postal Service or other private or commercial
interstate carriers to send payments to pool participants and
wiring funds to and from pool accounts to Siegelâs personal bank

accounts. (Compl. @ 49.)

 
Case 1:13-cv-05755-NLH-JS Document 12 Filed 12/30/14 Page 5 of 39 PagelD: 248

Cc. Siegelâs Misappropriation of Monarch and QEP Pool
Participant Funds

12. TOTE and MJS were each to receive an incentive
fee of thirty-five percent (35%) of all net new trading profits
each month, plus 0.2 percent of the net asset values of the
pools as a monthly management fee and approximately two percent
(2%) of the net asset value of the pools annually as
administrative fees or operating expenses. (Compl. @ 23.)

13. Although Siegelâs trading generated some profits
in 2008, overall trading for both pools was unprofitable in
2009. (Id. F 24.)

14. Because there were no profits for either pool in
2009, no incentive fees were due to Defendants. (Id. 97 25.)

15. From approximately January 2008 through October
2010, Siegel transferred from Monarch and TOTE to his personal
bank accounts and a credit card account approximately $105,186
more than he and TOTE were purportedly due in incentive and
other fees. (Id. 7 26.)

16. In September 2008, Siegel withdrew approximately
$36,000 from QEP to pay non-pool expenses. In addition, from
September 2008 through October 2010, Siegel transferred from QEP
and MJS to his personal bank account and a credit card account
approximately $50,503 more than he and MJS were due in incentive

and other fees. Thus, in total, Siegel transferred from the QEP

 
Case 1:13-cv-05755-NLH-JS Document 12 Filed 12/30/14 Page 6 of 39 PagelD: 249

bank accounts and related account approximately $86,503 more
than he was purportedly due in incentive and other fees to his
personal bank accounts, a credit card account, and for the
purpose of paying non-pool expenses. (Id. @ 27.)

17. Siegel transferred approximately $511,598 from
bank accounts in the names of Monarch, QEP, and TOTE to his
personal bank accounts, to a credit card account and to at least
one individual. Siegel used some of these funds to pay personal
expenses. (Id. 7 28.)

18. From September 2008 through October 2010, Siegel
earned $319,909 in incentive, management and administrative fees
based on his trading for Monarch and QEP. (Id.)

19. From August 2007 through October 2010, Defendants
withdrew in total approximately $191,689 from Monarch and QEP
for non-pool expenses and fees to which Defendants were not
entitled. (Id.)

20. Siegel testified that he did not keep track of
the incentive fees, and that he âwas just drawing against the
fees that [he] felt. . . were being earned and [he] assumed
that the records and the brokerage office and the records at the
bank ultimately would . . . balance out.â (Mucha Decl., Ex. E
at 88:8-14.) He further testified that his principle in
determining the amount of incentive fees was âarbitrary,â that

he took whatever amount of money he felt he needed to pay

 
Case 1:13-cv-05755-NLH-JS Document 12 Filed 12/30/14 Page 7 of 39 PagelD: 250

personal expenses and living expenses, and that he would
thereafter calculate what amount of funds should have been
withdrawn. (Id. at 89:2-14.)

21. Defendants Siegel and MJS failed to return funds
to at least two pool participants who sought to withdraw their
funds from QEP at or near the end of 2009. (Compl. 7 29.)
Specifically, two QEP pool participants, Carl Coffman and Robert
Lund, sought to withdraw their funds from QEP at or near the end
of 2009. (Mucha Decl. @ 46.) Siegel and MJS failed to return
approximately $71,998.60 to Coffman and approximately $32,685.87
to Lund. (Id.)

D. Defendant TOTE Failed to Provide Copies of Monthly

Futures Commission Merchants Statements to the Monarch

Pool Participants

22. From August 2007 through October 2010, TOTE,
acting through Siegel, failed to provide pool participants with
copies of the monthly statements received by TOTE from the
futures commission merchants (hereafter, âFCMâ) who carried
Monarchâs trading accounts. (Compl. 7 30.)

23. Instead of providing monthly statements from the
FCM, TOTE, acting through Siegel, provided only a few quarterly
updates generally describing the status of Monarchâs trading and
sometimes included only a page or two of the statements received

from the FCM. (Id. { 32.)

E. Siegel Controlled TOTE and MJS and was their Agent
24, From August 2007 through October 2010, Siegel was
a controlling person of TOTE and MJS. Siegel acted as the Chief
Executive Officer and sole principal of both TOTE and MJS.
Siegel was the sole person responsible for directing trades on
behalf of TOTE and MUS and for the day-to-day operations of TOTE
and MJS. (Id. 7 33.)
F. Recent Trading Communications
25. Since the filing of the complaint in this matter,
the Commission has received inquiries from some individuals who
had prior dealings with Siegel concerning his trading system or
his mentoring. These individuals informed Commission staff that
Siegel contact them recently to discuss participation in trading
activity. (Mucha Decl. FI 49.)

II. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

 

A. Jurisdiction and Venue

1. This Court has jurisdiction over this action
pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1, which
authorizes the Commission to bring an action in the United
States district court for injunctive relief against any person
whenever it shall appear to the Commission that such person has
engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in any act or
practice constituting a violation of any provision of the Act or

any rule, regulation or order thereunder.

 
Case 1:13-cv-05755-NLH-JS Document 12 Filed 12/30/14 Page 9 of 39 PagelD: 252

2. Venue properly lies with the Court pursuant to
Section 6c(3) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1, in that the
Defendants are found in, inhabit, reside and/or transact

business in the District of New Jersey.

B. Standard for Default Judgment
3. The first step in obtaining a default judgment is
the entry of default. âWhen a party against whom a judgment for

affirmative relief is sought has failed to plead or otherwise
defend, and that failure is shown by affidavit or otherwise, the
Clerk must enter the partyâs default.â Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(a).
4, The Clerk properly entered default against
Defendants. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
4(e) (1), service of process may be effected on an individual by
âdelivering a copy of the summons and of the complaint to the
individual personally[.]â Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(e) (1). Service of
process as to corporate defendants is proper if made, as was
done in this case, on a corporationâs officer âby delivering a
copy of the summons and of the complaint to an officer[.]â Fed.
R. Civ. P. 4{h) (1). Here, Defendant Siegel was served with the
summons and complaint directed to him, individually, and as an
officer of Defendants TOTE and MJS, on October 20, 2013. (Decl.
of James A. Garcia 7 4.) Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 12(a) (1), Defendants were required to respond to the

Commissionâs complaint within twenty-one days from the date of

 
Case 1:13-cv-05755-NLH-JS Document 12 Filed 12/30/14 Page 10 of 39 PagelD: 253

service. Although service of process was properly effected,
Defendants failed to timely respond to the complaint and have

1 Accordingly, the

otherwise failed to appear in this action.
Commission requested entry of default on January 31, 2014 and
the Clerk properly entered default on February 3, 2014.

5. âFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 55(b) (2)
authorizes courts to enter a default judgment against a properly

served defendant who fails to a file a timely responsive

pleading.â Chanel v. Gordashevsky, 558 F. Supp. 2d 532, 535

 

(D.N.J. 2008) (citing Anchorage Assoc. v. Virgin Is. Bd. of Tax

 

Rev., 922 F.2d 168, 177 n.9 (3d Cir. 1990)). However, a party
seeking default judgment âis not entitled to a default judgment

as of a right.â Franklin v. Natâl Maritime Union of America,

 

1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9819, at *3-4 (D.N.J. 1991) (quoting 10

(1983)), aff'd, 972 F.2d 1331 (3d Cir. 1992). The decision to

 

1 The Court notes the Declaration of James A. Garcia, which
indicates that counsel for the Commission was contacted by an
attorney, Jack A. Berenato, Esq., on behalf of Defendant Siegel
on November 26, 2013. (Decl. of James A. Garcia (hereafter,
âGarcia Decl.â) I 7.) The Commissionâs counsel represents that
multiple attempts to reach Mr. Berenato were made between
November 27, 2013 and January 27, 2014 to ascertain when he
intended to appear on behalf of Defendants and file answers to
the complaint. (Id. @ 8.) Mr. Berenato purportedly contacted
counsel for the Commission on February 7, 2014 and advised that
he intended to seek to vacate the Clerkâs entries of default.
(Id. 7 11.) At this time, none of the defendants has filed a
motion to vacate the entry of default.

enter a default judgment is âleft primarily to the discretion of

the district court.â Hritz v. Woma Corp., 732 F.2d 1178, 1180

 

(3d Cir. 1984) .?
6. Although every âwell-pled allegationâ of the
complaint, except those relating to damages, are deemed

admitted, Comdyne I. Inc. v. Corbin, 908 F.2d 1142, 1149 (3d

 

Cir. 1990), before entering a default judgment the Court must
decide whether âthe unchallenged facts constitute a legitimate
cause of action, since a party in default does not admit mere
conclusions of law,â Chanel, 558 F. Supp. 2d at 535 (citing

Directv, Inc. v. Asher, No. 03-1969, 2006 WL 680533, at *1

 

(D.N.J. Mar. 14, 2006)).

7. âThree factors control whether a default judgment
should be granted: (1) prejudice to the plaintiff if default is
denied, (2) whether the defendant appears to have a litigable
defense, and (3) whether defendant's delay is due to culpable

conduct.â Chamberlain v. Giampapa, 210 F.3d 154, 164 (3d Cir.

 

2000); United States v. $55,518.05 in U.S. Currency, 728 F.2d

 

 

* Rule 55(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides
that notice of the motion for default judgment must be sent when
âthe party against whom a default judgment is sought has
appeared personally or by a representative,â and written notice
of the application must be sent at least seven days before the
hearing. Here, none of the defendants has appeared personally
or through a representative. Nonetheless, counsel for the
Commission represented that he would send copies of this
application to Mr. Berenato and Defendant Siegel so as to
provide notice of the motion. (Garcia Decl. @ 16.)

192, 195

(3d Cir. 1984). If a review of the complaint

demonstrates a valid cause of action, the Court must then

determine whether plaintiff is entitled to default judgment.

Cc.

2008,

Defendants Violated Section 4b(a) (2) (i) and (iii) of
the Act for conduct prior to June 18, 2008 and Section
4b(a) (1) (A) and (C) of the Act for conduct on or after

Section 4b(a) (2) (i) and (i311) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§

6b(a) (2) (i) and (iii), makes it unlawful:

for any person, in or in connection with any
order to make, or the making of, any
contract of sale of any commodity for future

3 Portions of the Act were amended in 2008. Defendantsâ alleged
acts occurred between 2007 and 2010, making both versions of the
Act applicable to this case. The amendments to the relevant
section are not so substantive as to warrant separate
discussion.

any such order or contract or the
disposition or execution of any
such order or contract, or in
regard to any act of agency
performed with respect to such

9. With respect to conduct occurring on or after
June 18, 2008, Section 4b(a) (1) (A) and (C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
Â§ 6b(a) (1) (A) and (C), make it unlawful

paragraph (2), with the other person[.]

10. Courts have held that misappropriation of pool
participant funds, knowingly or with reckless disregard for the
truth, constitutes a violation of Section 4b(a) (2) (i) and (iii)
of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6b(a) (2) (1) and (i111), with respect to
acts occurring before June 18, 2008, and Section 4b(a) (1) (A) and

WL 3771407, at *5 (N.D. Iil. June 12, 2013); Commodity Futures

Trading Commân v. Palmer, Civ. A. No. CV-09-76-S-EJL, 2012 WL

 

6930320, at *5 (D. Id. Nov. 30, 2012).

11. The facts alleged by the Commission establish
that from January 2008 through at least October 2010, Defendants
Siegel and TOTE, by and through Siegel, cheated, defrauded,
attempted to cheat or defraud, willfully deceived and/or
attempted to deceive customers of Monarch by misappropriating
customer funds knowingly or with reckless disregard for the
truth.

12. The facts alleged by the Commission establish
that from September 2008 through October 2010, Defendants Siegel
and MJS, by and through Siegel, cheated, defrauded, attempted to
cheat or defraud, willfully deceived and/or attempted to deceive
customers of QEP by misappropriating customer funds knowingly or
with reckless disregard for the truth.

13. By this conduct, Siegel, MJS and TOTE, by and
through Siegel, violated Section 4(b) (a) (2) (i) and (i111) of the
Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6b(2) (i) and (iii), with respect to conduct
occurring before June 18, 2008, and violated Section 4b(a) (1) (A)
and (C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6b(a)(1) (A) and (C) with respect

to conduct occurring on or after June 18, 2008.

14

 
Case 1:13-cv-05755-NLH-JS Document 12 Filed 12/30/14 Page 15 of 39 PagelD: 258

14. The foregoing acts of Siegel were committed
within the scope of his employment, office or agency with TOTE
and MJS. Therefore, pursuant to Section 2(a) (1) (B) of the Act, 7
U.S.C. Â§ 2(a) (1) (B), TOTE and MJS are liable for these acts.

15. Siegel controlled TOTE and MUS, directly or
indirectly, and knowingly induced, directly or indirectly, the
acts of TOTE and MJS by transferring more funds than were due to
Siegel, TOTE or MJS to Siegelâs personal bank account and a
credit card account. Therefore, pursuant to Section 13(b) of
the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13c(b), Siegel is liable for TOTEâs and MJSâ
violations of Section 4b(a)(2) (1) and (iii) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
Â§ 6b (2) (1) and (iii) with respect to conduct occurring before
June 18, 2008 and Section 4b(1) (A) and (C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
Â§ 6b(a) (1) (A) and (C) with respect to conduct occurring on or
after June 18, 2008.

D. Fraud by a CPO and an AP of a CPO

16. Section 40(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 60(1) makes
it unlawful for a commodity pool operator or associated person
(hereafter, âAPâ) of a commodity pool operator, to âemploy any
device, scheme, or artifice to defraud any client or participant
or prospective client or participant,â or âto engage in any
transaction, practice, or course of business which operates as a
fraud or deceit upon any client or participant or prospective

client or participant.â

15

 
Case 1:13-cv-05755-NLH-JS Document 12 Filed 12/30/14 Page 16 of 39 PagelD: 259

17. A âcommodity pool operatorâ is any person
âengaged in a business that is of the nature of a commodity
pool, investment trust, syndicate, or similar form of
enterprise, and who, in connection therewith, solicits, accepts,
or receives from others, funds, securities, or property, either
directly or through capital contributions, the sale of stock or
other forms of securities, or otherwise, for the purpose of
trading in commodity interests, including any . . . commodity
for future delivery, security futures product, or swap
[.]â% 7 U.S.C. Â§ la(il).

18. From August 2007 through October 2010, Defendants
TOTE and MJS acted as commodity pool operators of the Monarch
and QEP pool by engaging in a business that is of the nature of
an investment trust, syndicate, or similar form of enterprise
and by soliciting, accepting or receiving funds from others for
the purpose of trading in futures. In fact, TOTE and MJS
registered as CPOs exempt from CPO registration pursuant to
Commission Regulation 4.13(a).

19. An âassociated personâ is âany natural person who
is associated in any of the following capacities with... [a]
commodity pool operator as a partner, officer, employee,
consultant, or agent (or any natural person occupying a similar
status or performing similar functions), in any capacity which

involves (i) the solicitation of funds, securities, or property

16

 
Case 1:13-cv-05755-NLH-JS Document 12 Filed 12/30/14 Page 17 of 39 PagelD: 260

for a participation in a commodity pool or (ii) the supervision
of any person or persons so engaged[.]â 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.3 (aa) (3).

20. As chief executive officer and sole principal of
TOTE and MJS, who solicited pool participants and funds
therefrom, Siegel acted as an associated person (hereafter,
âAPâ) of both commodity pool operators.

21. Defendants TOTE and MJS, as commodity pool

operators, and Defendant Siegel as an associated person of a
commodity pool operator, violated Section 40(1) (A) and (B) of
the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 60(1), in that they employed a device,
scheme or artifice to defraud pool participants and/or engaged
in transactions, practices or a course of business which
operated as a fraud or deceit upon pool participants. These
fraudulent acts include misappropriating funds invested by pool
participants.

22. The misappropriation of pool participant funds
was made through use of the mails or other instrumentalities of
interstate commerce, including wiring funds to and from pool
accounts to Siegelâs personal bank accounts, in violation of
Section 40(1) (A) and (B) of the Act.

23. Defendants engaged in the acts and practices
described above knowingly or with reckless disregard for the

truth.

17

 
Case 1:13-cv-05755-NLH-JS Document 12 Filed 12/30/14 Page 18 of 39 PagelD: 261

24. Siegel controlled TOTE and MJS, directly or
indirectly, and knowingly induced, directly or indirectly, the
acts of TOTE and MJS constituting the violations described
above. Therefore, pursuant to Section 13(b) of the Act, 7
U.S.C. Â§ 13c(b), Siegel is liable for TOTEâs and MJSâ violations
of Section 40(1)(A) and (B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 60(1) (A) and
(B).

25. The foregoing acts of Siegel occurred within the
scope of his employment, office or agency with TOTE and MJS.
Therefore, TOTE and MUS are liable for Siegelâs violations of
Section 40(1) (A) and (B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6o(1) (A) and
(B), pursuant to Section 2(a) (1) (B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§

2 (a) (1) (B).
E. Violation of Commission Regulation 4.13 (cÂ¢) (2) (i)

26. Commission Regulation 4.13(c) (2) (i), 17 C.F.R. Â§
4.13(c) (2) (i), requires that CPOs claiming exemption for
registration under Regulation 4.13(a) (2) must promptly furnish
to all pool participants a copy of each monthly statement for
the pool that the CPO receives from the FCM.

27. As found above, between August 2007 and October
2010, TOTE, acting through Siegel, failed to provide pool
participants with copies of the statements received by TOTE from
the FCM who carried Monarchâs trading accounts as required under

Commission Regulation 4.13(c) (2) (i), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 4.13(c) (2) (1).

18

 
Case 1:13-cv-05755-NLH-JS Document 12 Filed 12/30/14 Page 19 of 39 PagelD: 262

Instead, TOTE, acting through Siegel, provided only a few
quarterly updates.

28. Siegel controlled TOTE, directly and indirectly,
and did not act in good faith or knowingly induced, directly or
indirectly, the conduct of TOTE described above. Therefore,
pursuant to section 13(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13c(b), Siegel
is liable for TOTEâs violations of Commission Regulation
4.13 (c) (2) (i), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 4.13(c) (2) (i).

29. The foregoing acts of Siegel occurred within the
scope of his employment, office or agency with TOTE. Therefore,
TOTE is liable for Siegelâs acts pursuant to Section 2 (a) (1) (B)
of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(a) (1) (B).

F. Defendantsâ Failure to Answer Warrants Entry of
Default Judgment

30. All three factors that the Court must consider in
deciding whether to enter default judgment support entry of
default judgment against Defendants.

31. As to the first factor, whether the party subject
to default judgment has a meritorious defense, because
Defendants failed to file responsive pleadings it is difficult
to ascertain any defenses that might be available. The Court
has considered the well-pleaded allegations in the Commissionâs
complaint, which must be accepted as true, and the Mucha

Declaration and attachments thereto, and there is nothing in

19

 
Case 1:13-cv-05755-NLH-JS Document 12 Filed 12/30/14 Page 20 of 39 PagelD: 263

these documents to suggest that the Commission would not prevail

if this action were to proceed. See UFCW Local 152 Health &

 

Welfare Fund v. Holiday Shop N Bag at Welsh Road, No. 12-7305,

 

2013 WL 3441290, at *3 (D.N.J. July 9, 2013) (âAbsent Defendants'
responsive pleadings, however, the Court is unable to readily
ascertain any meritorious defenses that would be available to
Defendants at this time.â).

32. As to the second factor, prejudice to the party
seeking default judgment, it is evident to the Court that the
Commission will not be able to vindicate the public interest and
recover funds misappropriated by Defendants. The Commission
seeks through this action, inter alia, injunctive relief so as
to ensure that Defendants do not continue to defraud members of
the public, as well as restitution and disgorgement of funds
misappropriated by Defendants. Despite being properly served
and having ample opportunity to respond to the complaint,
Defendants have not participated in this action and have thereby
stalled the Commissionâs efforts to address Defendantsâ alleged
wrongdoing and recover funds that were purportedly
misappropriated by Defendants. Under these circumstances,
absent a default judgment, the Commission will continue to be
unable to obtain the relief it seeks from Defendants, and

members of the public are at risk of being further defrauded by

20

 
Case 1:13-cv-05755-NLH-JS Document 12 Filed 12/30/14 Page 21 of 39 PagelD: 264

Defendants. Accordingly, the second factor weighs in favor of
entry of default judgment.

33. Finally, under the third factor, which requires
the Court to consider Defendantsâ culpability, the record
demonstrates that Defendants, through Defendant Siegel, were
each properly served and had notice that a lawsuit had been
filed against them. Defendants filed no answer or other
responsive pleading and have made no efforts to obtain an
extension of time to respond to the complaint. Defendants were
given ample time and opportunity to respond, and counsel for the
Commission attempted without success on several occasions to
contact counsel for Defendant Siegel to assess whether
Defendants intended to participate in this matter. Nonetheless,
Defendants have not taken any action to respond to the complaint
or otherwise defend against the claims brought by the
Commission. Thus, the Court finds no excuse or reason for
Defendantsâ default other than their own conduct. The third
factor therefore also weighs in favor of entry of a default
judgment.

G. Relief Requested

34, The allegations in the Commission's pleadings,
taken as true, are sufficient to show that the Commission is
entitled to the requested relief. Accordingly, having

considered all of the relevant factors, the Court concludes that

21

 
Case 1:13-cv-05755-NLH-JS Document 12 Filed 12/30/14 Page 22 of 39 PagelD: 265

the relief sought by the Commission in the complaint is
appropriate.

35. Under Section 6(c) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-
l(a), injunctive relief is appropriate where there is a
reasonable likelihood of future violations. âIn reviewing the
grant of an injunction, âthe ultimate test .. . is whether the
defendant's past conduct indicates that there is a reasonable
likelihood of further violations in the future.ââ Commodity

Futures Trading Commân v. Wilshire Inv. Mgmt. Corp., 531 F.3d

 

1339, 1346 (11th Cir. 2008); Commodity Futures Trading Commân v.

 

Am. Metals Exchange Corp., 991 F.2d 71, 73 n.3 (3d Cir. 1993)

 

(âinjunctive relief may issue upon a showing that the defendants
âengaged in, [are] engaging in, or [are] about to engage in any
act or practice constituting a violation of any provision of the
Act.â The plaintiff also needed to show that the defendants
were still in business so that there was a likelihood that
violations would continue.â).

36. The Court concludes that permanent injunctive
relief is warranted since it is probable that Defendants will
engage in future violations of the Act. In this case,
Defendants engaged in egregiously fraudulent conduct in
violation of the Act and misappropriated nearly $200,000 for
Siegelâs personal expenses. Siegel testified that he siphoned

funds arbitrarily, without regard to the amount of fees actually

22

 
Case 1:13-cv-05755-NLH-JS Document 12 Filed 12/30/14 Page 23 of 39 PagelD: 266

due to him, and according to the Mucha Declaration has contacted
individuals subsequent to the filing of this action to discuss
participation in trading activity. Considering the totality of
the circumstances, it appears likely that Siegel, individually
or through TOTE or MJS, may engage in future violations of the
Act if not permanently enjoined. Accordingly, the Court will
enjoin Defendants from future violations of the Act as well as
trading on behalf of any other person or entity, including, but
not limited to, any association, partnership, corporation or
trust.

37. The Court further concludes that restitution is
appropriate with respect to Defendants Siegel and MJS so as to
make whole the two QEP pool participants, Messrs. Coffman and
Lund, who sought to withdraw their funds from QEP near the end
of 2009. â¢ââ*Restitution is meant to make the damaged persons
whole and compensate them for a defendantâs wrongful acts.ââ

Commodity Futures Trading Commân v. Perkins, Civ. No. 06-4674,

 

2009 WL 806576, at *10 (D.N.J. Mar. 25, 2009) (quoting Commodity

Futures Trading Commân v. AVCO Fin., 28 F. Supp. 2d 104, 121

 

(S.D.N.Y. 1998)). Siegel and MJS failed to return approximately
571,998.60 to Coffman and $32,685.87 to Lund for a total of
$104,684.47.

38. The Court also finds that disgorgement of gains

is an appropriate remedy under the circumstances. â¢ââThe

23

 
Case 1:13-cv-05755-NLH-JS Document 12 Filed 12/30/14 Page 24 of 39 PagelD: 267

disgorgement remedy is not intended to compensate investors;
rather, it is intended to deprive the violator of his ill-gotten
gains and to further the deterrence objectives of the [Act].ââ
Perkins, 2009 WL 806576, at *11 (quoting AVCO, 28 F. Supp. 2d at
121). Defendants misappropriated $191,689.25 from Monarch and
QEP pool participants by withdrawing money from the pools for
non-pool expenses and fees to which Defendants were not
entitled. These ill-gotten gains should be disgorged.

39. The Commission also seeks in its motion for
default judgment an assessment of civil monetary penalties at
three times the amount of Defendantsâ gain. Section 6c(d) (1) of
the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(d), provides that the Court may assess
civil monetary penalties of ânot more than the greater of
$100,000 or triple the monetary gain to the person for each

â

violation.â4 The Court notes that civil monetary penalties âact
to vindicateâ the provisions of the Act and the Commissionâs

rules and âare also exemplary; they remind both the recipient of

the penalty and other persons subject to the Act that

 

4 The Commission Regulations set forth inflation-adjusted civil
monetary penalties, which state that the penalty for violations
committed between October 23, 2004 and October 22, 2008 are ânot
more than the greater of $130,000 or triple the monetary gain to
such person for each such violation,â and the penalty for
violations committed after October 23, 2008 are ânot more than
the greater of $140,000 or triple the monetary gain to such
person for each such violation.â 17 C.F.R. Â§
143.8(a) (1) (12) (C)-(D).

Case 1:13-cv-05755-NLH-JS Document12 Filed 12/30/14 Page 25 of 39 PagelD: 268

noncompliance carries a cost. To effect this exemplary purpose,
that cost must not be too low or potential violators may be
encouraged to engage in illegal conduct.â In re GNP
Commodities, Inc. [1990-92 Transfer Binder] Com. Fut. L. Rep.
(CCH) @ 25,360 at 39,222 (CFTC Aug. 11, 1992).

40. This case warrants the imposition of a civil
monetary penalty against Defendants because they knowingly
engaged in fraud, which is a core violation of the Act. See
Commodity Futures Trading Commân v. Arrington, 998 F. Supp. 2d
847, 875-76 (D. Neb. 2014) (citation omitted). Defendant Siegel
even contacted individuals after this case was filed to discuss
participation in trading activity, and it is not clear that
Defendant Siegel, individually or through TOTE or MJS, will
comply with the Act in the future unless deterred by civil
monetary penalties. Accordingly, the Court will award civil
monetary penalties.

41. The Court notes the Commissionâs allegation in
the complaint that â[e]lach act of misappropriation ... is
alleged as a separate and distinct violationâ of the Act.
(Compl. @ 41.) Pursuant to the Act, the Court could award
$130,000 or $140,000 (depending on the date of the violation) or
treble damages for each violation. Although the complaint does
not delineate each separate withdrawal from pool funds for

improper purposes, it appears from the Mucha Declaration that

25

 
Case 1:13-cv-05755-NLH-JS Document 12 Filed 12/30/14 Page 26 of 39 PagelD: 269

there were several separate transfers over the course of at
least two years. (See, e.g., Mucha Decl. (TT 36, 39.) The
Commission seeks treble damages based solely on the total amount
improperly retained by Defendants,Â° i.e., three times $191,689
for a total of $575,067. This amount is likely less than the
amount the Court could, in its discretion, award if it assessed
a penalty of $130,000 or $140,000 per violation, given that
there were apparently multiple fraudulent withdrawals of pool
participant funds. Based on Defendantsâ knowing and repeated
violations of the Act, the Court finds that a civil monetary
penalty in the amount of triple the monetary gain to Defendants

is appropriate.

 

Â° In this regard, Siegel transferred approximately $511,598 for
personal expenses, when the incentive, management and
administrative fees due totaled only $319,909. The difference
of $191,689 is the amount that Defendants misappropriated, and
Defendants seek triple this amount. In the Order for Relief,
infra, the Court separates this award in accordance with the
respective amounts withdrawn from Monarch and QEP pool funds.
Therefore, the civil monetary penalty against Defendants Siegel
and TOTE is $315,557.67, which is triple the $105,185.89
misappropriated from Monarch pool participants, and the civil
monetary penalty against Defendants Siegel and MJS is
$259,510.08, which is triple the $86,503.36 misappropriated from
QEP pool participants.

B. Restitution

5.

Defendants Siegel and MJS, jointly and severally,

shall pay restitution in the amount of $104,684.47 (hereafter,

the âRestitution Obligationâ), plus post-judgment interest.

Post-judgment interest shall accrue beginning on the date of

entry of this Order and shall be determined by using the

30

 
Case 1:13-cv-05755-NLH-JS Document 12 Filed 12/30/14 Page 31 of 39 PagelD: 274

Treasury Bill rate prevailing on the date of entry of this Order
pursuant to 28 U.S.c. Â§ 1961.

6. To effect payment of the Restitution Obligation
and the distribution of any restitution payments to Messrs.
Coffman and Lund, the Court appoints the National Futures
Association (hereafter, âNFAâ) as Monitor (hereafter,
âMonitorâ). The Monitor shall collect restitution payments from
Defendants and make distribution to Messrs. Coffman and Lund in
accordance with the Findings of Fact, @ 21, set forth above.
Because the Monitor is acting as an officer of this Court in
performing these services, the Monitor shall not be liable for
any action or inaction arising from NFAâs appointment as
Monitor, other than actions involving fraud,

7. Defendants Siegel and MJS shall make Restitution
Obligation payments under this Order to the Monitor in the name
âSiegel/MJS Restitution Fundâ and shall send such Restitution
Obligation payments by electronic funds transfer, or by U.S.
postal money order, certified check, bank cashierâs check or
bank money order, to the Office of Administration, National
Futures Association, 300 South Riverside Plaza, Suite 1800,
Chicago, Illinois 60606 under cover letter that identifies the
paying Defendant and the name and docket number of this
proceeding. The paying Defendant shall simultaneously transmit

Financial Officer, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Three
Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street, N.W., Washington, D.C.
20581.

8. The Monitor shall oversee the Restitution
Obligation and shall have the discretion to determine the manner
of distribution of such funds in an equitable fashion to Messrs.
Coffman and Lund or may defer distribution until such time as
the Monitor deems appropriate. In the event that the amount of
Restitution Obligation payments to the Monitor are of a de
minimus nature such that the Monitor determines that the
administrative cost of making a distribution to eligible pool
participants is impractical, the Monitor may, in its discretion,
treat such restitution payments as civil monetary penalty
payments, which the Monitor shall forward to the Commission
following the instructions for civil monetary penalty payments
set forth below.

9. Defendants MJS and Siegel shall execute any
documents necessary to release funds that they have in any
repository, bank, investment or other financial institution,
wherever located, in order to make partial or total payment
toward the Restitution Obligation.

10. The Monitor shall provide the Commission at the
beginning of each calendar year with a report detailing the

disbursement of funds to Messrs. Coffman and Lund during the

32

cover letter that identifies the name and docket number of this
proceeding to the Chief Financial Officer, Commodity Futures
Trading Commission, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street,
N.W., Washington, D.C. 20581.

11. The amounts payable to each restitution recipient
shall not limit the ability of any restitution recipient from
proving that a greater amount is owed from Defendants or any
other person or entity, and nothing herein shall be construed in
any way to limit or abridge the rights of any pool participant
that exist under state or common law.

12. Pursuant to Rule 71 of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure, each restitution recipient is explicitly made an
intended third-party beneficiary of this Order and may seek to
enforce obedience of this Order to obtain satisfaction of any
portion of the Restitution Obligation that has not been paid by
Defendants Siegel and MJS, to ensure continued compliance with
any provision of this Order, and to hold Defendants in contempt
for any violations of any provision of this Order.

13. To the extent that any funds accrue to the U.S.
Treasury for satisfaction of the Restitution Obligation, such
funds shall be transferred to the Monitor for disbursement in

accordance with the procedures set forth above.

CFTC Obtains Judgment against Commodity Pool Operators TOTE Fund LLC and MJS
Capital Management LLC, and their Principal, Michael J. Siegel, for Commodity Pool Fraud
and Other Violations

Federal Court Orders Defendants to Pay More than $871,000 in
Restitution, Disgorgement, and Civil Monetary Penalties

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced that Judge Noel L. Hillman
of the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey entered an Order of default judgment and permanent injunction
against Defendants TOTE Fund LLC (TOTE) and MJS Capital Management LLC (MJS), two Commodity Pool Operators,
and their sole principal Michael J. Siegel of Northfield, New Jersey.

The courtâs Order requires Siegel and MJS, jointly and severally, to pay restitution of $104,684.47, disgorgement of
$86,503.36, and a civil monetary of $259,510.08. Siegel and TOTE are also jointly and severally required to pay
disgorgement of $105,185.89 and a civil monetary penalty of $315,557.67. The Order further imposes permanent trading
and registration bans against all Defendants. The Order, entered on December 30, 2014, stems from a CFTC Complaint
filed on September 27, 2013 (see CFTC Press Release 6723-13).

The Order finds that Defendants violated the Commodity Exchange Act by misappropriating funds totaling approximately
$191,689 from Monarch Futures Fund LLC (Monarch) and QEP Futures Fund LLC (QEP), two commodity pools
operated by TOTE and MJS, respectively, by withdrawing money from the pools for non-pool expenses and taking fees to
which they were not entitled. According to the Order, despite earning incentive, management, and administrative fees of
$319,909 based on his trading, Siegel transferred approximately $511,598 from bank accounts in the names of Monarch,
QEP, and TOTE to his personal bank accounts, to a credit card account, and to at least one individual and used some of
these funds to pay personal expenses.

The Order further finds that MJS and Siegel misappropriated funds by failing to return funds to at least two pool
participants who sought to withdraw their funds from QEP. Also, TOTE, acting through Siegel, failed to provide Monarch
pool participants with copies of monthly statements received by TOTE from Futures Commission Merchants, as required
by a CFTC Regulation, the Order finds.

The CFTC cautions victims that restitution orders may not result in the recovery of money lost because the wrongdoers
may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers and to
ensure the wrongdoers are held accountable.

The CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Kara L. Mucha, James A. Garcia, Michael W.
Solinsky, Charles D. Marvine, and Gretchen L. Lowe.

FINDINGS AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

III.
The Commission finds the following:
A. SUMMARY

During the Relevant Period, Summit Energy acted as an unregistered Commodity
Trading Advisor (âCTAâ) by, for compensation or profit, engaging in the business of advising
more than fifteen clients as to the value of or the advisability of trading in natural gas swaps and
natural gas commodity futures contracts and held itself out generally to the public as a CTA.

B. RESPONDENT

Respondent Summit Energy Services, Inc. is a Delaware corporation based in
Louisville, Kentucky. During the Relevant Period, Summit Energy was not registered with the
Commission in any capacity.

C. FACTS

During the Relevant Period, Summit Energy, using the mails or any means or
instrumentality of interstate commerce, engaged in the business of advising its clients as to the
value of or the advisability of trading in over-the-counter (âOTCâ) natural gas swaps and natural
gas commodity futures, for compensation or profit, without being registered. Most of Summit
Energyâs clients were commercial entities that purchase physical natural gas and electricity as
part of their energy needs. Summit Energy provided its clients with advice concerning physical
natural gas and electricity transactions. Throughout the Relevant Period, more than 15 clients
received advice from Summit Energy as to the value of or the advisability of trading in natural
gas OTC swaps and futures for hedging purposes. With respect to some of its clients, Summit
Energy also acted as a broker in OTC natural gas swaps trades.

Through its website and public brochures, Summit Energy publicly offered prospective
clients ârisk managementâ services which included advising its clients as to the value of or the
advisability of trading in natural gas swaps and futures. Summit Energyâs commodity trading
advice was part of, and not solely incidental to, its business.

IV.
LEGAL DISCUSSION

Section 1a(12)(i) of the Act defines a CTA as any person who, for compensation or profit,
engages in the business of advising others, either directly or through publications, writings, or
electronic media, as to the value of or advisability of trading in, inter alia, futures or swaps. Pursuant to
Section 1a(38) of the Act, the term âpersonâ imports the plural or singular, and includes individuals,
associations, partnerships, corporations, and trusts. Section 4m(1) of the Act requires a person who is

 

? Since September 26, 2014, Summit Energy has been registered with the Commission as a CTA.
acting as a CTA and makes use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce in
connection with the personâs business as such CTA to register with the Commission unless the person
provides such commodity trading advice to fewer than fifteen persons in the preceding twelve months
and does not hold itself out generally to the public as a CTA.

During the Relevant Period Summit Energy acted as a CTA by engaging, for compensation
or profit, in the business of advising its clients as to the value of or the advisability of trading in
OTC natural gas swaps and futures. In addition, Summit Energy held itself out publicly as a CTA by
offering to others its risk management services, including commodity trading advice concerning natural
gas futures and OTC swaps, through its website and sales brochures. In addition, Summit Energy was
not exempt from registration as a CTA under any provision of the Act or Commission Regulations.

V.
FINDINGS OF VIOLATION

Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that, during the Relevant Period, Summit
Energy violated Section 4m(1) of the Act.

CFTC Orders Summit Energy Services, Inc. to Pay $140,000 Civil Monetary Penalty and
Cease and Desist from Acting as an Unregistered Commodity Trading Advisor

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today entered an Order requiring Summit
Energy Services, Inc. (Summit Energy), a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Louisville,
Kentucky, to pay a $140,000 civil monetary penalty for acting as an unregistered Commodity Trading Advisor (CTA).

The Order finds that, from at least October 2012 to September 25, 2014, Summit Energy, for compensation or profit,
engaged in the business of advising more than 15 clients as to the value of or the advisability of trading in futures
contracts and over-the-counter (OTC) natural gas swaps and held itself out generally to the public as a CTA, without
being registered as such with the CFTC.

Furthermore, according to the Order, Summit Energy, through its website and public brochures, offered prospective
clients ârisk managementâ services, which included advising its clients as to the value of or the advisability of trading in
natural gas swaps and futures. Most of Summit Energyâs clients were commercial entities that purchased physical natural
gas and electricity as part of their energy needs. The Order also finds that Summit Energy acted as a broker in OTC
natural gas swaps transactions with respect to some of its clients and that Summit Energyâs commodity trading advice
was not solely incidental to its business, but rather was an integral part of the services it provided to its clients.

In addition to the civil monetary penalty, the CFTC ordered Summit Energy and its parents, affiliates, subsidiaries,
successors, and assigns to cease and desist from further violations of the CTA registration provision of the Commodity
Exchange Act.

The CFTC appreciates the assistance of the National Futures Association in this matter.
The CFTC staff members responsible for this matter are Amanda L. Olear and Kevin Piccoli of the Division of Swap Dealer

and Intermediary Oversight and W. Derek Shakabpa, Judith M. Slowly, Trevor Kokal, David Acevedo, Lenel Hickson, Jr.,
and Manal M. Sultan of the Division of Enforcement.

Respondents.

 

ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTIONS 6(c) AND 6(d) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, AS AMENDED,
MAKING FINDINGS AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

I.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ) has reason to believe that
Olam International, Ltd. (âOlam Internationalâ) and Olam Americas, Inc. (âOlam Americasâ)
(collectively, âRespondentsâ) violated Section 4a(e) of the Commodity Exchange Act (âActâ),
7 ULS.C, Â§ 6a(e) (2012), on seven trading days between February 2011 and August 2014; Section
Ac(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6c(a) (2012), and Commission Regulation (âRegulationâ) 1.38(a),
17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.38(a) (2014), on sixty-four occasions between February 2011 and January 2013;
and Section 41 of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 61 (2012), and Regulation 18.04, 17 C.FLR. Â§ 18.04 (2014).
Therefore, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest that public
administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted to determine whether Respondents
engaged in the violations set forth herein and to determine whether any order should be issued
imposing remedial sanctions.

I.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Respondents have
submitted an Offer of Settlement (âOfferâ), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Without admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, Respondents consent to
the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 6(c) and 6(d) of the
Commodity Exchange Act, as Amended, Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions
(âOrderâ) and acknowledge service of this Order.

 

' Respondents consent to the entry of this Order and to the use of these findings in this proceeding and in
any other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party; provided,
however, that Respondents do not consent to the use of the Offer, or the findings or conclusions in this
Order consented to in the Offer, as the sole basis for any other proceeding brought by the Commission,
other than in a proceeding in bankruptcy or to enforce the terms of this Order. Nor do Respondents

 
Il.
The Commission finds the following:
A. Summary

On seven trading days between February 2011 and August 2014, Olam International and
Olam Americas held aggregated net positions in cocoa futures contracts that exceeded position
limits established by ICE Futures U.S. Inc. âIFUSâ). On sixty-four occasions between February
2011 and January 2013, Olam International and Olam Americas executed exchange of futures for
physical transactions (âEFPsâ) opposite each otherâs cocoa futures trading accounts, even though
their accounts were not independently controlled as required for such transactions. Additionally,
Olam International submitted to the Commission a Form 40 âStatement of Reporting Traderâ in
each of 2010 and 2012, and Olam Americas submitted to the Commission a Form 40 in 2012,
that failed to identify all required information, including that their cocoa futures trading accounts
were not independently controlled.

B. Respondents

Olam International, Ltd. is a global supply chain manager of agricultural commodities
with its headquarters in Singapore. Among other activities, it purchases cocoa from farmers,
merchants, and marketing associations, processes cocoa, and sells it to chocolate manufacturers.
Olam International has never been registered with the Commission in any capacity.

Olam Americas, Inc. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Olam International and is based in
New Jersey. Among other activities, it purchases cocoa from Olam International and unrelated
parties and sells cocoa to end users in the United States. Olam Americas has never been
registered with the Commission in any capacity.

C, Facts

The trading of cocoa futures is subject to position limits established by IFUS. IFUS Rule
6.17(b), which was in effect at all times relevant to this Order, states that the maximum net long
or short position that a market participant may own or control in the cocoa futures contract traded
on IFUS is 1,000 contracts during the spot month, a limitation that becomes effective at the close
of business on the trading day prior to first notice day.â

At all times relevant to this Order, Olam International operated a futures trading desk in
London, England, and Olam Americas operated a futures trading desk in Summit, New Jersey.
Between February 2011 and January 2013, cocoa futures traders on both desks had access to
each otherâs position information and regularly discussed the cocoa markets, and Olam
Americasâ cocoa futures traders placed orders to buy and sell cocoa futures contracts on behalf

consent to the use of the Offer or this Order, or the findings or conclusions in this Order consented to in
the Offer, by any other party in any other proceeding.

* First notice day is the first day on which notices of intent to deliver actual commodities against futures
market positions can be received,

 
of Olam Internationalâs cocoa operations in Ecuador. Additionally, between January 2012 and
May 2012, an Olam Americas cocoa futures trader supervised certain of Olam Internationalâs
cocoa futures trading activities. As a result, between February 2011 and January 2013, Olam
Internationalâs and Olam Americasâ cocoa futures positions should have been aggregated for
position limit purposes.

When aggregated, the cocoa futures positions of Olam International and Olam Americas
exceeded the 1,000-contract spot month position limit for cocoa futures contracts traded on IFUS
as follows: in the March 2011 contract, by 508 contracts on February 11, 2011; in the March
2012 contract, by 923 contracts on February 14, 2012, 516 contracts on February 15, 2012, and
90 contracts on February 16, 2012; and in the May 2012 contract, by 187 contracts on April 16,
2012 and 26 contracts on April 17, 2012.

The Act and Regulations permit noncompetitive trading, such as EFPs, only if such
transactions are conducted in accordance with rules of an exchange, such as IFUS, that are
approved by the Commission. At all times relevant to this Order, IFUS rules permitted the
transaction of EFPs between independently controlled accounts. However, Olam Internationalâs
and Olam Americasâ cocoa futures trading accounts were not independently controlled between
February 2011 and January 2013, rendering the sixty-four EFPs they executed opposite each
otherâs accounts during this time period impermissible.

Upon special call by the Commission, traders who hold reportable positions are required
to file with the Commission a âStatement of Reporting Traderâ on Form 40. The Form 40 asks
the reporting trader to identify whether the trader controls the futures or options trading of any
other persons, including individuals, associations, partnerships, corporations, and trusts. It also
asks the reporting trader if any other persons control the trading of the reporting trader. Olam
International, in 2010 and 2012, and Olam Americas, in 2012, filed with the Commission a
âStatement of Reporting Traderâ that answered both of these questions in the negative, failing to
disclose that their cocoa futures trading accounts were not independently controlled.

On February 25, 2013, Olam International and Olam Americas began aggregating their
cocoa futures positions and submitted a revised Form 40 to the Commission disclosing that they
were trading cocoa futures as a single global unit. Subsequently, on August 15, 2014, their
ageregated cocoa futures positions exceeded the 1,000-contract spot month position limit for
cocoa futures contracts traded on IFUS in the September 2014 contract by 24 contracts, Olam
Americas self-reported this violation to IFUS and reduced their position to within position limits
on the following trading day.

IV.
LEGAL DISCUSSION

Section 4a(e) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6a(e) (2012), makes it unlawful âfor any person to
violate any bylaw, rule, regulation, or resolution of any contract market, derivatives transaction
execution facility, or other board of trade licensed, designated, or registered by the Commission
... fixing limits on the amount of trading which may be done or positions which may be held by
any person under contracts of sale of any commodity for future delivery or under options on such

 
contracts or commodities, if such bylaw, rule, regulation, or resolution has been approved by the
Commission or certified by a registered entity pursuant to [S]ection S5c(c)(1)â of the Act,

7 U.S.C, Â§ 7a-2(c) (2012). On September 1, 2005, the Board of Trade of the City of New York,
Inc. (âNYBOTâ), a designated contract market pursuant to Section 5 of the Act that by later
merger became IFUS,â submitted writteri certification to the Commission pursuant to Section
Se(c)(1) of the Act for an amendment to its Rule 6.17 that established the spot month limit for
cocoa futures positions traded on the exchange as 1,000 contracts.

Regulation 150.5(g), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 150.5(g) (2014), provides that â[i]n determining
whether any person has exceeded the limits established [by a designated contract market], all
positions in accounts for which such person by power of attorney or otherwise directly or
indirectly controls trading shall be included with the positions held by such person; such limits
upon positions shall apply to positions held by two or more person[s] acting pursuant to an
express or implied agreement or understanding, the same as if the positions were held by a single
person.â Similarly, IFUS Rule 6.12 provides that IFUSâs position limits âshall apply to all
positions held by any Person, including those positions in accounts for which such Person by
power of attorney or otherwise directly or indirectly controls trading; and in the case of positions
held by two (2) or more Persons acting pursuant to an express or implied agreement or
understanding, the same as if all of the positions were held by a single Person.â

The Commission does not need to establish scienter âi.e., proof of intent to exceed the
applicable position limit â in order to prove a violation of Section 4a(e) of the Act. See Saberi v.
CFTC, 488 F.3d 1207, 1212 (9th Cir. 2007); CFTC vy, Hunt, 591 F.2d 1211, 1218 (7th Cir,
1979). Instead, the plain language of Section 4a(e) of the Act âunambiguously imposes liability
for violations of contract market position limit rulesâ such as IFUS Rule 6.17. Saberi, 488 F.3d
at 1212.

Because Olam International and Olam Americas directly or indirectly controlled the
otherâs cocoa futures trading activities and/or acted pursuant to an express or implied agreement
or understanding, their cocoa futures positions should have been aggregated for position limit
purposes beginning in February 2011. By exceeding, on an aggregated basis, the IFUS spot
month limit of 1,000 cocoa futures contracts on seven trading days between February 2011 and
August 2014, Respondents violated Section 4a(e) of the Act.

Section 4c(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6c(a) (2012), makes it unlawful to engage in any
transaction that is of the character of, or commonly known to the trade, as a âwash saleâ or that is
a fictitious sale, Regulation 1.38(a), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.38(a) (2014), requires futures contracts to be
executed openly and competitively and permits noncompetitive trading only if executed âin
accordance with written rules of the contract market which have been submitted to and approved
by the Commission, specifically providing for the noncompetitive execution of such
transactions.â At no time relevant to this Order did IFUS rules approved by the Commission

 

* On January 12, 2007, IntercontinentalExchange, Inc. (âICEâ) announced that its merger with NYBOT
was complete. Effective September 3, 2007, NYBOT changed its corporate name to IFUS.

 
permit EFPs, noncompetitive trades, between accounts under common control.â By executing
sixty-four EFPs opposite each otherâs cocoa futures trading accounts, which were not
independently controlled as required for such transactions, between February 2011 and January
2013, Respondents violated Section 4c(a) of the Act and Regulation 1.38(a).

Section 4i of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 61 (2012), and Regulation 18.04, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 18.04
(2014), together require every trader who owns, holds, or controls a reportable futures or options
position to file with the Commission a âStatement of Reporting Traderâ on Form 40 in response
to the Commissionâs special call, to be completed in accordance with the formâs
instructions, The Form 40 specifically requires a reportable trader to state whether it controls the
futures trading of anyone else and whether anyone else controls the trading of the reportable
trader. By failing to disclose that their cocoa futures trading accounts were not independently
controlled on Olam Internationalâs 2010 and 2012 Form 40s and on Olam Americasâ 2012 Form
40, Respondents violated Section 4i of the Act and Regulation 18.04.

Vv.
FINDINGS OF VIOLATION

Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that Respondents violated Sections 4a(e),
4c(a), and 41 of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6a(e), 6c(a), and 61 (2012), and Regulations 1.38(a) and
18.04, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1.38(a) and 18.04 (2014),

CFTC Imposes $3 Million Penalty against Olam International, Ltd. and Olam Americas, Inc.
for Violating Cocoa Position Limits and Unlawfully Executing Noncompetitive Trades

Olam International and Olam Americas failed to disclose to the CFTC
that their cocoa futures trading was not independently controlled

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today issued an order filing and
simultaneously settling charges against Singapore-based Olam International, Ltd. (Olam International), which operates
a futures trading desk in London, England, and its subsidiary, Olam Americas, Inc. (Olam Americas), which is based in
Summit, New Jersey and operates a futures trading desk there. Both companies purchase, sell, and trade cocoa and other
agricultural products. The CFTC Order requires Olam International and Olam Americas to pay a $3 million civil monetary
penalty and prohibits them from committing future violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC
Regulations, as charged.

The CFTC Order finds that between February 2011 and January 2013, the cocoa futures positions of Olam International
and Olam Americas were not independently controlled. Cocoa futures traders on both desks had access to each otherâs
position information and regularly discussed the cocoa markets; Olam Americas cocoa traders placed orders to buy and
sell cocoa futures for Olam Internationalâs account; and an Olam Americasâ cocoa trader supervised certain of Olam
Internationalâs cocoa futures trading activities between January 2012 and May 2012, according to the CFTC Order. The
CFTC Order finds the accounts, therefore, should have been aggregated for purposes of complying with the applicable
position limits and that, when aggregated, the cocoa futures positions of Olam International and Olam Americas
exceeded the 1,000-contract spot month position limit for cocoa futures contracts traded on ICE Futures U.S. Inc. (IFUS)
on six trading days between February 2011 and January 2013, in violation of the CEA.

The CFTC Order also finds that Olam International and Olam Americas impermissibly entered into exchange of futures for
physical transactions (EFPs) opposite each otherâs cocoa futures trading accounts. According to the CFTC Order, EFPs are
noncompetitive transactions that are permitted only if conducted in compliance with exchange rules approved by the
CFTC. According to the CFTC Order, although IFUS rules approved by the CFTC between February 2011 and January 2013
allowed EFPs, those rules required that the EFPs be transacted only between independently controlled accounts. Because
Olam Internationalâs and Olam Americasâ cocoa futures trading accounts were not independently controlled, the CFTC
Order finds that the 64 EFPs they conducted opposite each other violated the CEA and CFTC Regulations.

Additionally, the CFTC Order finds that Olam International filed a âStatement of Reporting Traderâ (Form 40) with the
CFTC in 2010 and 2012, and Olam Americas filed a Form 40 with the CFTC in 2012, that failed to disclose that their cocoa
futures trading accounts were not independently controlled, in violation of the CEA and CFTC Regulations. According to
the CFTC Order, on February 25, 2013, Olam International and Olam Americas filed a revised Form 40 disclosing to the
CFTC that they were trading cocoa futures as a single global unit. But after they began aggregating their cocoa futures
positions, the CFTC Order finds that Olam International and Olam Americas exceeded the 1,000-contract spot month
position limit for cocoa futures contracts traded on IFUS on yet another trading day in August 2014, in violation of the
CEA.

The CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this action are Stephanie Reinhart, David Chu, Judith
McCorkle, Tom Nolan, Elizabeth Streit, Scott Williamson, and Rosemary Hollinger. Kelly Beck, Harold Hild, Matthew
Hunter, and Vincent Varisano of the CFTCâs Division of Market Oversight also assisted in this matter.

I INTRODUCTION

On September 30, 2013, Plaintiff U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission (âCFTCâ or âCommissionââ) filed a Complaint against Defendants
Lions Wealth Holdings, Inc. and Lions Wealth Services, Inc., both d/b/a Lions
Wealth Capital or âLWCâ (collectively âLions Wealthâ), 20/20 Precious Metals,
Inc. (â20/20 Metalsâ), and Bharat Adatia (âAdatiaâââ) (collectively âDefendantsââ)
seeking injunctive and other equitable relief, as well as the imposition of civil
penalties, for violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (the âActââ), 7 U.S.C.
Â§Â§ 1 et seg.â Specifically, the Commission charged Defendants with violating
Sections 4(a), 4b(a)(2)(A)-(C) and 6(c)(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6(a),
6b(a)(2)(A)-(C) and 9(1) (2012), and Commission Regulation 180.1(a)(1)-(3),
17 C.F.R. { 180.1(a)(1)-(3) (2013), in connection with illegal off-exchange
transactions involving the purported purchase or sale of physical metals on a

leveraged, margined or financed basis (âRetail Commodity Transactionsâ).

 

' The Commission commenced this action in the District of Nevada. On or around December 9,
2013, that Court issued an Order transferring this case to the Central District of California.

* Effective J uly 16, 2011, Section 742 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act of 2010 (âDodd-Frank Actâ), Public Law 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376 (2010),
broadened the scope of the CFTCâs jurisdiction to include financed commodity transactions with
retail customers, including those at issue in this matter by amending Section 2(c)(2) of the Act to
create a new subparagraph, Section 2(c)(2)(D), entitled âRetail Commodity Transactionsâ.
Specifically, this broadened jurisdiction requires that financed commodity transactions with
retail customers be executed on an exchange and, among other things, subjects these transactions
to Section 4(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6(a), and the anti-fraud provisions of Section 4b of the Act,

THE PARTIES AGREE AND THE COURT HEREBY FINDS:
A. _ Findings of Fact

1. The Parties to this Consent Order

14. Plaintiff U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an
independent federal regulatory agency charged by Congress with administering
and enforcing the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1 et seg., and the Commission Regulations
promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1.1 et seg. From at least July 16, 2011
through July 31, 2012, Defendant Lions Wealth Holdings, Inc. (âLWHâ) was an
active Nevada corporation with its principal place of business in in San Juan
Capistrano, California. From at least July 16, 2011 through the present, Defendant
Lions Wealth Services, Inc. (ââLWSâ) has been an active Nevada corporation with
its principal place of business in San Juan Capistrano, California. Neither LWH
nor LWS has been registered with the Commission in any capacity.

15. From at least November 2009 through December 2012, when its
incorporation was revoked, Defendant 20/20 Precious Metals, Inc. was a Nevada
corporation. From at least July 16, 2011 through February 22, 2013, 20/20 Metals
maintained an office in San Juan Capistrano, California. 20/20 Metals has never
been registered with the Commission in any capacity.

16. Defendant Bharat Adatia, also known as Brad Adatia, resides in San

Juan Capistrano, California. Adatia is the sole officer and director of LWH and

20/20 Metals, and the president and director of LWS. Adatia managed and ran the
day-to-day operations of Lions Wealth and 20/20 Metals, including
communicating with Hunter Wise Commodities, LLC and its various subsidiaries
and related entities (collectively âHunter Wiseâ) about retail metals transactions.
Adatia was registered with the Commission in various capacities from 1996
through 2009, including as an associated person of 20/20 Trading Company, Inc.
(20/20 Tradingââ), a registered introducing broker (âIBââ), from 2000 to 2009.

2. Overview of Defendantsâ Business Model

17. Beginning on or shortly after July 16, 2011, the date Section
2(c)(2)(D) of the Act became effective, and continuing through at least
February 22, 2013 (the ârelevant timeââ), Defendants LWH and LWS, both doing
business as âLions Wealth Capitalâ or âLWCââ, through their officers, agents and
other persons acting on their behalf, including Defendant Adatia, and defendant
20/20 Metals, through its officers, agents and other persons acting on its behalf,
including Adatia, offered to enter into, entered into, confirmed the execution of,
and conducted an office and business in the United States for the purpose of
soliciting, accepting orders for, and otherwise dealing in illegal, off-exchange,
financed commodity transactions with retail customers.

18. Defendants falsely claimed to sell physical commodities, including

gold, silver, platinum, and palladium, in off-exchange transactions to retail

8

ase 8:13-cv-01923-JLS-JPR Document 55 Filed 01/16/15 Page 9of37 Page ID#:5

customers throughout the United States. Most notably, Defendants falsely claimed
to: (a) sell actual physical metals to customers; (b) make loans to customers to
purchase the physical metals; (c) transfer title of physical metals to customers; and
(d) arrange for the transfer and storage of customersâ physical metals in
independent depositories where such metal purportedly was held on the customersâ
behalf.

19. In fact, Defendants did not purchase, sell, transfer ownership of, or
arrange for storage of any physical metals in connection with the financed
commodity transactions, and Defendants never had possession of, or title to, the
physical metals they purported to purchase, sell, finance and/or transfer on behalf
of retail customers. Defendants also did not lend funds to customers to purchase
physical metals or advance or loan physical metals to customers. Rather, during
the relevant time, Defendants introduced their retail customer accounts to Hunter
Wise, a purported precious metals dealer that recorded and tracked customer orders
and trading positions. In reality, Hunter Wise did not purchase, sell, finance and/or
transfer metals in connection with Defendantsâ financed transactions, but rather
traded derivatives in its own margin accounts. Defendants knew or recklessly
disregarded that Hunter Wise did not sell or transfer ownership of any physical

metals and/or store physical metals in any depositories for or on behalf of Lions

Wealth and/or 20/20 Metals retail customers. Defendants also did not disclose
their relationship with Hunter Wise to retail customers.

20. Lions Wealth and 20/20 Metals customers were charged a
commission (up to 15% of the total metal value of a single transactions and up to
38% of the funds deposited for each transaction), a price spread (a 1.5-3% mark-up
or mark-down from the current price of the metal), interest on the purported loan
(at an annual rate of approximately 9.5%) and other fees (such as a âservice feeâ of
approximately 7% annually on the total market value of the account) for the Retail
Commodity Transactions. The customerâs equity increased or decreased as prices
of metals fluctuated, and was also subject to depletion on a daily basis by interest
and service fees. When a customerâs equity fell below 15% of the value of the
total trading position, the customer received a margin call, requiring the customer
to deposit additional funds in order to maintain the trading position. If the
customerâs equity dropped to 9% of the total value, any open trading positions
were liquidated.

21. Although no physical metal was held anywhere in the Lions Wealth or
20/20 Metals customersâ names, Lions Wealth and 20/20 Metals fraudulently
charged Lions Wealthâs and 20/20 Metalsâ customers commissions on orders for
purchasing metals, interest on non-existent loans to finance supposed metals

purchases, storage fees on non-existent metal, and other fees supposedly incurred

in connection with the purchase of physical metals. In the course of this scheme,
during the relevant time, at least 44 Lions Wealth retail customers collectively
incurred at least $1,807,712 in trading losses, commissions, interest charges and
other fees, and at least 30 20/20 Metals retail customers collectively incurred at
least $570,266 in trading losses, commissions, interest charges and other fees.

3. Defendants Knew or Recklessly Disregarding that there Was No
Metal Underlying the Retail Commodity Transactions

22. On April 26, 2011, prior to the effective date of the Dodd-Frank Act
and the broadening of the CFTCâs anti-fraud jurisdiction, the Commission filed a
civil injunctive enforcement action in the U.S. District Court for the Central
District of California against 20/20 Metals and Adatia, as well as 20/20 Trading, a
defunct entity and non-party to this action, and various individual defendants. See
CFTC v. 20/20 Trading Company, Inc. et al., Case No. SACV 11-643-JLS
(FMOx) (CD Cal.) (the âPrior 20/20 Litigationâ).

23. Inthe Prior 20/20 Litigation, the Commission charged the defendants
with committing fraud in connection with both commodity options trading and
leveraged metals sales. As to the purported sale of precious metals to retail
customers, the business model employed by 20/20 Metals and 20/20 Trading prior
to April 26, 2011, and at issue in the Prior 20/20 Litigation, was the same or

substantially similar to the business model utilized for the Retail Commodity

Transactions as more fully described herein. Ultimately, the Court found that â
prior to the broadening of the Commissionâs authority under the Dodd-Frank Act â
the Commission lacked jurisdiction over the defendantsâ leverage metals business
and dismissed those claims.

24. During the course of the Prior 20/20 Litigation, the Court appointed a
temporary receiver who filed a report on May 23, 2011. See CFTC v. 20/20
Trading, Rept. of Temporary Receiverâs Activities, Doc. No. 60. (CD Cal. May 23,
2011). Among other things, the receiver advised the Court and the parties in the
Prior 20/20 Litigation that, after reviewing documents and conducting interviews
with Adatia and representatives from Hunter Wise, among others, he was unable to
âverify the existence, ownership, and safekeeping of precious metalsâ purportedly
purchased and held in 20/20 Trading and 20/20 Metals customer accounts.

25. Adatia received and reviewed the receiverâs report, and therefore
knew or recklessly disregarded that the court appointed receiver had been unable to
identify, locate, and/or inspect any metal purportedly held on behalf of retail
customers. Nevertheless, Adatia subsequently failed to verify that any depository
held or was holding metal on behalf of 20/20 Trading, 20/20 Metals, Lions Wealth

and/or any of their customers during the relevant period of this action.

4. Defendants Solicited Customers for Illegal, Off-Exchange Retail
Commodity Transactions and Falsely Represented that Customers
Were Purchasing Actual Physical Metal

26. In connection with the Retail Commodity Transactions, Lions
Wealthâs website falsely represented that: (a) Lions Wealthâs retail customers
could purchase physical commodities, specifically gold, silver, platinum and
palladium; (b) customers purchased the âactual physical commodityâ in the âform
of either bullion bars or coinsâ, as opposed to âbuy[ing] a futures or options
contract on an underlying commodityâ; and (c) customers could elect to receive
physical metals or have Lions Wealth store metals on the customerâs behalf in âa
depository selected by LWCâ as Lions Wealth is âtied to and work[s] with experts
who understand the specifics of storing metal bullion.â Similarly, 20/20 Metalsâ
website claimed that retail customers could either take delivery of physical metals
or rely on 20/20 Metals and its âexperts who understand the specifics of storing
metal bullionâ for storage servicesââWe know how to keep your bullion safe and
sound.â The website also references the possibility of financing a metals purchase.

27.  Inaddition, Defendantsâ written marketing materials falsely
represented that in Retail Commodity Transactions customers purchased physical
metals through a financing arrangement that had âthe benefits of a âdown paymentâ
similar to those found in real estate, where you buy a propertyâ but âunlike real

estate, the non-recourse loan . . . has limited risk similar to an âoptionâ, but with no

immediate expiration date to worry about. With no ticking clock, [customers] have
an open-ended commodity transaction.â

28. Through their officers, agents and other persons acting on their behalf,
including Adatia, both Lions Wealth and 20/20 Metals knew or recklessly
disregarded that, in connection with their Retail Commodity Transactions, neither
they nor Hunter Wise purchased or sold physical metals, stored metals, delivered
metals to an affiliate, bank or depository, or lent funds to customers for the
purchase of physical metals. Defendants also knew or recklessly disregarded the
fact that there were no accounts with any metals depository holding physical
metals in the name of Lions Wealth, 20/20 Metals and/or any of their retail
customers.

5. Defendants Made Material Misrepresentations to Retail Customers
about the Purchase, Sale, Financing and Delivery of Physical Metal

29. Most, if not all, Lions Wealth customers executed the Customer
Purchase and Sale Agreement (the âPurchase Agreementâ) in which Lions Wealth
falsely represented that customers were purchasing âphysical commoditiesâ from
Lions Wealth Capital âon credit with financing provided by Lions Wealth
Service[s] Inc.â Prior to July 16, 2011, most if not all 20/20 Metals customers
executed a Purchase Agreement with 20/20 Metals that contained the same or

substantially similar provisions as those quoted herein.

30. Inthe Purchase Agreement, Defendants knowingly or recklessly
misrepresented that, within seven days of receiving a customerâs payment of the
required portion of the purchase price, they would âdeliver the commodities to
Customer, to Customerâs designee, or for the benefit of Customer to banks or
depositories used for the purpose of safekeeping Customer commodities
(collectively referred to as Bank).â Further, Defendants represented that
âOwnership of Commodities purchased by Customer, subject to any security
interest therein, passes to Customer upon delivery to Customer, Customerâs
appointed designee, or to Bank to be held for Customer,â and that âCommodities
transferred to Bank for Customer will be delivered as an undivided share of a
fungible lot and held in safekeeping on a fungible basis with the commodities of
other Bank Customers.â Finally, in the Purchase Agreement, Lions Wealth
represented that LWC (or, as applicable, 20/20 Metals) âmay utilize one or more
sources, including its own inventory, to acquire the physical commodities
necessary to fulfill its obligations to Customer.â

31. Most, if not all, Lions Wealth customers executed a Loan, Security
and Storage Agreement (the âLoan Agreementâ) with Lions Wealth in which Lions
Wealth falsely represented that LWS loans âphysical commoditiesâ or âsums of
money to purchase physical commodities, including, but not limited to, delivery to

a depository, costs, fees, storage, collateral, security interests, certain risks and

costs associated with each loan transactionâ to retail customers in exchange for a
âsecurity interestâ in all âcommoditiesâ belonging to and held on behalf of the
customer. Prior to July 16, 2011, most if not all 20/20 Metals customers executed
a Loan Agreement with 20/20 Metals that contained the same or substantially
similar provisions as those quoted herein.

32. The Loan Agreement states that â[c]ommodities transferred to Bank
for Borrower will be delivered as an undivided share of a fungible lot and held in
safekeeping on a fungible basis with the commodities of other Bank customers.â
The Loan Agreement further specifies that â[u]pon delivery of commodities on
behalf of Borrower to Bank, Borrower will receive a confirmation evidencing that
such quantity of commodities has been delivered to the depository and is being and
will continue to be held as an undivided share of the commodities so held by the
depository, on the purchaserâs behalf, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances,
other than liens of [LWS or 20/20 Metals].â

33. In fact, Defendants did not disburse any funds for the so-called âloanâ
or âfinancedâ portion of Retail Commodity Transactions, nor did Defendants ever
intend to loan or finance the Retail Commodity Transactions. Moreover, to the
extent that Hunter Wise purported to extend purchase money loans to Defendantâs
customers, such loans were a sham because Hunter Wise never obtained any

physical metal for, or delivered any such metal to, those customers.

34. Nevertheless, during the relevant time, Lions Wealth customers
collectively paid $47,161 in interest on the purported loans to retail customers and
20/20 Metals customers collectively paid $56,551 in interest on the purported loans
to retail customers in connection with Retail Commodity Transactions.

35. Further, Lions Wealth and 20/20 Metals customer account statements
reflect metal purchases and sales that were not actually made. Hunter Wise
generated the customer account statements and transmitted them to Lions Wealth
and/or 20/20 Metals, or directly to retail customers, pursuant to certain agreements
between Hunter Wise and Defendants. The customer account statements notified
retail customers of âcommodities purchasedâ, âopening buyâ, âclosing buyâ and/or
âcommodity receivedâ into the account. The statements also informed customers
that they had âloan feesâ and a loan âbalanceâ even though Defendants did not
disburse any funds for the so-called âloanâ or âfinancedâ portion of Retail
Commodity Transactions and loans purportedly extended by Hunter Wise were a
sham.

36. Defendants also falsely claimed to âshipâ or âreceiveâ metals
following each trade in Transfer of Commodity notices. The Transfer of
Commodity notices sent to retail customers included, among other provisions,

language reflecting âProduced Received into your Accountâ and a statement that

Lions Wealth âhereby confirms that a depository (âCustodianââ) authorized by

connection with, a contract for the purchase or sale of a commodity for future
delivery unless the transaction is conducted on or subject to the rules of a board of
trade that has been designated or registered by the Commission as a contract
market.

41. By the conduct described in paragraphs 14 through 36, above,
Defendants Lions Wealth and 20/20 Metals, individually and/or through their
employees and agents including Adatia, violated Section 4(a) of the Act by

is therefore liable as a controlling person for the violations by Lions Wealth and
20/20 Metals to the same extent as those Defendants.

44. Unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, there is a reasonable
likelihood that the Defendants will continue to engage in the acts and practices
alleged in the Complaint and in similar acts and practices in violation of the Act

their employment, agency, or office with these entity Defendants, and are deemed
to be the acts, omissions and failures of those Defendants by operation of Section

likelihood that the Defendants will continue to engage in the acts and practices
alleged in the Complaint and in similar acts and practices in violation of the Act

and Regulations.

fashion to Defendantsâ customers identified by the CFTC or may defer distribution

restitution payments as civil monetary penalty payments, which the Monitor shall
forward to the Commission following the instructions for civil monetary penalty
payments set forth in paragraphs 70 and 71, below.

Federal Court Orders California-Based Defendants Bharat Adatia and His Companies, Lions
Wealth Holdings, Lions Wealth Services, and 20/20 Precious Metals to Pay over $5.3
Million in Monetary Sanctions for Multi-Million Dollar Fraudulent Precious Metals Scheme

Defendants Defrauded Customers of More than $2.3 Million in
Connection with Illegal Off-Exchange Precious Metals Transactions

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced that on January 16, 2015,
Judge Josephine L. Staton of the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered a Consent Order for
permanent injunction against Defendants Lions Wealth Holdings, Inc. and Lions Wealth Services, Inc. (collectively
Lions Wealth), 20/20 Precious Metals, Inc. (20/20 Metals), and their principal Bharat Adatia (aka Brad Adatia) for
fraudulently soliciting retail customers and prospective customers to enter into off-exchange trading of precious metals
on a leveraged, margined or financed basis. Adatia resides in San Juan Capistrano, California. The Defendants were also
charged in the CFTC Complaint with falsely representing that customers were purchasing actual physical metal and
issuing false account statements, among other illegal conduct (see CFTC Press Release and Complaint 6729-13,
September 30, 2013).

The courtâs Consent Order requires Lions Wealth and Adatia jointly to pay restitution of $1,773,013, and 20/20 Metals and
Adatia jointly to pay restitution of $543,227 (resulting in a combined restitution sum of $2,316,240) and requires the
Defendants to pay a civil monetary penalty totaling $3,072,490. The Order also imposes permanent trading, solicitation,
and registration bans against the Defendants and prohibits them from violating the Commodity Exchange Act and a CFTC
Regulation, as charged.

According to the CFTCâs Complaint, the Defendants falsely claimed to sell physical metals (including gold, silver,
platinum, and palladium); make loans to customers to purchase physical metals; and arrange for the storage and transfer
of customersâ physical metals to an independent depository. The Complaint further charged that the Defendants did not
sell or transfer ownership of any physical metals or disburse funds as loans and that, in fact, no metals were stored in any
depositories for or on behalf of Lions Wealth and 20/20 Metals customers. Rather, the Defendants used a portion of the
funds received from retail customers to enter into paper transactions with a third-party, Hunter Wise Commodities, LLC
(Hunter Wise) (see CFTC Press Releases 6447-12, December 5, 2012 and 6935-14, May 22, 2014).

Specifically, the Order finds that between July 16, 2011 and February 22, 2013, the Defendants falsely claimed to sell
physical metals. During that time, at least 44 Lions Wealth retail customers collectively incurred at least $1,807,712 in
trading losses, commissions, interest charges, and other fees. The Order further finds that at least 30 20/20 Metals retail
customers collectively incurred at least $570,266 in trading losses, commissions, interest charges, and other fees. The
Defendants knew or recklessly disregarded that there was no metal underlying the retail commodity transactions,
according the Order.

The Order provides that Melanie Damian, Esq. is responsible for collecting restitution and making any distributions to
Lions Wealth and 20/20 Metals customers. Ms. Damian was appointed by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District
of Florida as Special Monitor, Corporate Manager, and Equity Receiver in the CFTCâs enforcement action against Hunter
Wise and certain of its associated entities.

The CFTC cautions victims that restitution orders may not result in the recovery of money lost because the wrongdoers
may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers and to
ensure the wrongdoers are held accountable.

The CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this action are Elizabeth N. Pendleton, Melissa
Glasbrenner, Joseph Konizeski, William P. Janulis, Scott Williamson and Rosemary Hollinger.

20. Atwood, Kardonick and Shapoff solicited clients through the internet at
www.atwoodjames.com, mail flyers, other promotional material, cold calling and other personal
solicitations. Atwood 8.A.âs solicitations focused on prospective clients located in Portugal and
Atwood Ltd.âs solicitations focused on prospective clients located in the United States, the
United Kingdom and elsewhere. However, Atwood 8.A. and Atwood Ltd. representatives
generally referred only to âAtwoodâ in their oral solicitations of prospective clients.

21, In its written and oral solicitations, Atwood, directly and through its employees,
agents and officers, and , Kardonick and Shapoff directly made material misrepresentations and
omissions concerning, among other things, Atwoodâs operations and regulatory status,
Defendantsâ lengthy and successful trading histories, the safety of clientsâ principal investment
due to the use of certain trading strategies, and Kardonick and Shapoffâs criminal records.
Overall, Atwood conveyed to prospective clients that profitable returms on small investments in
foreign currency options were highly likely, if not virtually guaranteed.

22. Through its website, www.atwoodjames.com, promotional material and customer
agreements, Atwood offerred trading in foreign currency options in the âglobal foreign exchange
marketâ (âforex marketâ). The website provided a detailed description of the forex market,
advice on investing in foreign currency options, as well as regularly updated market reports.
Through its oral solicitations of at least certain prospective clients, Atwood, Kardonick and

Shapoff emphasized that Atwood trades foreign currency options on U.S. exchanges on behalf of
DEC G1 2Atasd 66S chOEOSZEUSIMWP = Documeht 73! SFiReP 12/08/84 5 Peg? G24 P.88725

its clients.

23. On the website and in the flyers and other materials, Atwood created an
appearance of a sophisticated global enterprise. Its website contact information indicated its
office is in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. In email correspondence, Atwood also listed offices in
Amsterdam, London and New York City. To create the appearance of a strong European
presence, Atwood used what appears to be a British royal family crest with the letters âAâ and
âJâ emblazoned on it as its logo, and âLtdâ in its name, a British commonwealth term for
incorporation. The Atwood website also claimed to serve âclients al] over Western and Central
Europe.â Similarly, with respect to their solicitations of prospective clients in areas such as
Portugal, Atwood used âS.A.â in its name and logo.

24. â- Yet, in certain oral solicitations, Atwood, Kardonick and Shapoff emphasized that
while having a global presence, its main office was in Rochester, New York. Earlier United
States clients understood Atwoodâs main office to be in New York City.

25, Atwoodâs website reassured prospective clients that, with Atwood, the customer
receives over 30 years of combined tenure in the forex market with the ability to âinstantly
choose and execute trades most likely to succeed for our clients.â Atwoodâs website provided
further reassurance about Atwoodâs experience by stating that âit has unparalleled knowledge of
the forex market supported by experience in commodity futures and options.â Atwood further
claimed on the website that it focused on forex exclusively the last fifteen years. By such clairns,
Atwood implied that it has been profitably engaged in foreign currency trading for much of the
time after its initial incorporation in 1978.

26. Atwood also used promotional flyers that similarly emphasized its claimed almost

30-year trading history. At least one Atwood client saw an Atwood flyer stating, âSmall
DEC G1 2hddcd BGR cVOGSELEISIMWP = Documett 73! Fire i 2/0B/F4 âPages ti24 =P Baves

movements. Big benefits ... Every day for the past 29 years, we have been making timely and
intelligent decisions on behalf of our clients. Isnât it time you found out how you can earn big
investments from small currency movements?â

27. According to its website and oral solicitations, Atwood, Kardonick and Shapoff
purportedly assigned a team of three, a broker, analyst, and strategist, to each client account, and
promised weekly contact to discuss planned transactions. Clients either provided powers of
attorney to allow Atwood to trade on their behalf without explicit approval, i.e., with discretion,
or authorized all transactions to be executed on their behalf.

28. Atwood purported to offer four month trades where at the end of four months
Atwood exercised the options, and the client could elect to withdraw principal and revenue or
reinvest and plan another four month trade.

29. In the website, Atwood pronounced that âOur goal for you is a 30% return in four
months. That is equivalent to a 90% annual retum, When is the last time your stocks almost
doubled in a year!â

30. Inthe website, Atwood provided an example of âA Typical Forex Trading
Experienceâ to show how they may achieve this goal by using a trading strategy called a
âstraddle.â Atwoodâs website described a straddle as âplaying on both sides of the fenceâ and as
an âinsurance policyâ against heavy losses.

31.  Atwoodâs website also represented that Atwood trades through a clearing firm
and deals with established firms. To convince prospective clients that Atwood was a âlegitimate
company,â Atwoodâs website answered the question of âhow do I know that I am dealing with a
legitimate companyâ by stating that âit is important to trade with firms which are utilizing

established financial entitiesâ and claiming its âcurrent clearing firm did $28 billion dollars in
DEC G1 20Â¢4sd 6:62 cVDEOSLEIS!MWP Docume 73! âFife 12/08/F4 âPages GF24 0 PL ves

business last year.â

32. The Atwood website also reassured prospective clients that they would be able to
track an optionâs current market value because âcurrencies are traded on exchanges that have
continuous electronic quotation systems.â

33. To further lull prospective clients into believing that Atwood was legitimate and
regulated, the website then claimed that the Atwood advisors and principals âalthough they are
not have required to be licensed to trade foreign currency options, have been licensed through |
various governmental agencies at one time or another in the past most still are.â

34. Atwoodâs, Kardonickâs and Shapoftâs personal solicitations repeated the claims of
Atwoodâs vast and successful trading experience, the legitimacy of Atwood and its
representatives through licensing, regulation and exchange trading, the likelihood of profits, and
the security of clientsâ principal through the use of the straddle strategy.

35. Shortly after mailing an Atwood postage-paid flyer, or sometimes without prior
contact, prospective clients received a call from an Atwood representative. The Atwood
representative urged prospective clients to purchase options in Eurodollars or the Japanese Yen
in order to capitalize on markets that Atwood represented would move dramatically.

36. During these imitial calls with at least certain prospective clients, Atwood
representatives emphasized that Atwood was a licensed or registered U.S. entity regulated by the
U.S. government to trade foreign currency options, and in certain instances, claimed the trading
occurred on U.S. exchanges.

37. Atwood also reinforced the use and protections of the straddle strategy. Atwood
representatives told prospective clients that, with this strategy, clients would not lose their

principal. Those same representatives created the impression that Atwoodâs trading strategy
DEC G1 2@sel6:098cw-B6bS2Â°RIS'MWP DocumÃ©se73 ! Filed12/68/14 =Pagestrap24 oF. 1ives

virtually guaranteed profits. For example, one prospective client was told that he would never
lose his investment and if he did, he would be the âunluckiest trader in history.â

38. In one such solicitation, Atwood, Kardonick and Shapoff told clients and
prospective chents that Atwood conducted its business and trading out of its main office in
Rochester, New York. The Atwood website and emails, however, did not provide any
information conceming a Rochester office. To the contrary, the website listed only an address
and telephone number in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Atwood emails identified other Atwood offices
purportedly located in Amsterdam, London and NewYork City, but not Rochester. When
questioned by prospective clients, Atwood representatives provided a Rochester address, a local
Rochester telephone number and a toll-free telephone number. These contact points were for
Shapoff.

39. At least three of Atwoodâs clients called the Rochester local and toll-free
telephone numbers to verify that Atwood was a U.S. company with a legitimate and substantial
presence in the United States.

40. In one instance, a prospective client called the Rochester number and a person
named âGaryâ answered the telephone. âGaryâ told this client that all Atwood representatives
were out of the office and that no other executives were available to talk at that time. Gary also
told the client that the Rochester office had 16 other people in it, but that none had direct lines
because they were traders and did not wish to be interrupted while trading. âGaryâ was Shapoff.

41. Prospective clients were satisfied after calling the Rochester numbers that they
were dealing with a legitimate U.S. entity based in Rochester, New York.

42. During the telephone solicitations, if prospective clients questioned Atwoodâs,

Kardonickâs and Shapoffâs claim that clientsâ principal was not at risk through options trading,

10
DEC G1 2iPlebel 6-082 cVOGOS2Â°ESS'MWP DocumÃ©HÃ©73! Fil@eet2/08/f4 =PagesrhaP24 fF. 12-25

or if they were unable to invest the minimum investment amount of $13,000, the Atwood
representative referred them to the website and a âsenior trading advisor,â or to Kardonick
himself, who representatives and Kardonick describe as Atwoodâs head trading advisor.

43. Atwood representatives informed prospective clients that Kardonick had over 30
years of trading experience with a virtually spotless trading history. Representatives also told
prospective clients that Kardonick made the decisions on whether a prospective client may invest
less that the required minimum amount.

44. â_ Kardonick boasted to prospective clients that he was one of the best in the
business with over 30 years of experience in options trading âon Wall Streetâ and regaled them
with supposed connections with heads of state, Wall Street and politicians. He reiterated that
when trading with Atwood, clientsâ principal investments were safe and profitable returns were
virtually guaranteed.

45. _ As part of their solicitations, Atwood, Kardonick and Shapoff provided a
Customer Advisory Agreement for clients to sign (the âAgreementâ). The Agreement referenced
on-exchange and over-the-counter trading of foreign currency options but did not specify where
or with whom trading occurs. The only trading entity referenced is Atwood.

46. The Agreement also provided that Atwood charged a $220 commission fee and a
$20 administrative fee per option contract.

47. â Atwood instructed the prospective clients to strike certain risk disclosure
provisions in the Agreement, including provisions stating that âas a result of market conditions
and other factors, you may sustain a loss to your initial investment and any additional fund[s]
you deposit,â and â[s]trategies utilizing ...straddles may have as much risk as simple long or

short positions. It may be difficult or impossible to execute orders and offset or liquidate open

1]
DEC 41 2@ebe!6:08Fcv-BEBSPÂ°EIS'MWP DocumÃ©ft73 ! FilÃ©d412/08/14! SPage3eh24 =P. 13725

market position due to market liquidity and /or operations.â

48. At the same time, Atwood instructed prospective clients to highlight a statement
in the Agreement that emphasizes the much higher probability of a profitable returm based on the
straddle strategy touted in Atwoodâs personal solicitations of prospective clients. The

highlighted statement provides:
However options traded on a weighted straddle basis have a much higher
probability of making money Then [sic] just playing calls or puts alone, also
buying options closer to market price greatly enhances your chances of
making money.

49. The highlighted statement reinforced Atwoodâs, Kardonickâs and Shapoffâs oral
reassurances to prospective chents concerning the security of their investment through use of the
straddle strategy and eviscerated the risk disclosure set forth immediately above it in the
Agreement, which included the statement that âan option is an extremely complicated trading
vehicle, which carries substantial risks ...â

50. Atwood instructed clients to wire funds to U.S. bank accounts held in the name of
Atwood. Kardonick was a signatory on the Atwood bank accounts, and Shapoff was a signatory
on at least one Atwood bank account.

51. Thereafter, Atwood sent confirmations on Atwood letterhead of the profitable
trades purportedly executed by Atwood traders. The confirmations contained the clientâs name,
the clientâs account number, analyst name, and the date and details of the trades. The
confirmations did not reflect any exchange, clearing firm, or counterparty information. The only
company identified on the confirmations is Atwood. Based on the confirmations, Atwood clients
believed their funds were held in segregated accounts in their individual names.

52. Along with the confirmations showing profitable trading, Atwood, Kardonick and

Shapoff also made oral representations that clients were making money through Atwoodâs

12
DEC B81 2@eselG:09&cv-O6O82Â°RISIMWP DocumÃ©At73 ! Filed2/08/14' 5Pageaassh24 =P. L4ves

trading.

53. After receiving written and oral representations of profitable trading based on
their initial investments, some Atwood clients invested additional funds with Atwood.

54. To the extent that Atwood and Kardonick actually engaged in any trading on
behalf of clients, in at least one instance, Atwood and Kardonick traded client funds without
client authorization. The client had not granted Atwood power of attomey over the trading of his
account. He initially authorized certain trades in Euro options. Shortly thereafter, Atwood
informed the client that his Euro options trade had reached its strike price and, if the client
relinquished his position, he would sell for a profit of $1,000 or 15%. The client instructed
Atwood to exercise the option and pay him his principal and return. Instead, Atwood sold the
Euro option and bought five Japanese Yen puts for a total of $6,650. When the client
complained, an Atwood representative said Kardonick had authorized the trade.

55. With respect to at least certain Atwood clients, Atwood eventually notified them
that all their funds had been lost in trading, including their principal investments. Despite
demands by clients, Atwood refused to refund clientsâ principal. Atwood also refused to provide
additional documentation that Atwood was indeed trading on behalf of the clients.

3. Defendantsâ Solicitations Were False and Misleading
56. Defendantsâ solicitations of prospective and existing clients as alleged above were

materially false and misleading because, among other things:

(a) Atwood Ltd., Atwood 8.A., and Kardonick did not hold any known licenses or
registrations with the United States government in connection with the trading of foreign
currency options; specifically, Atwood and Kardonick were not registered with the
Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission or any other financial regulator;

(b) Atwood had not been profitably trading foreign currency options for the last fifteen
years on behalf of clients; as noted herein, no Atwood trading accounts were located and
funds in Atwood bank accounts were not used for trading on behalf of clients; in addition,

13
DEC G1 2@aseld:09%cV-B6BS29RISIMWP DocumÃ©stÃ©73 ! FilÃ©a2/68/14 =Page3eep24 =P. LS v25

although Atwood Ltd. has an incorporation date of 1978, the New York Division of
Corporations dissolved it in 1982, and Atwood did not form again until 2005. Similarly,

Atwood 8.A, did not form until 2003;

(c) Defendants failed to disclose that Kardonick and Shapoff had criminal fraud
convictions;

(d) Atwood did not maintain an office with staff in Rochester, New York. The Rochester
address Atwood provided was the address of a retail clothing store and the Rochester
telephone number Atwood provided was the home telephone number of . Shapoff; and

(e) even with the use of the straddle strategy, clientsâ principal was at risk when trading
foreign currency options.

57.  Atwoodâs, Kardonickâs and Shapoffâs solicitations were also false and misleading
because, despite claims that Atwood successfully traded on U.S, exchanges and that Atwood
traded through a clearing firm, Atwood never traded on behalf of or in the name of clients on
U.S. exchanges or indeed, anywhere. Likewise, Atwood did not have a relationship with a
clearing firm. Moreover, no at any FCM or other financial institution holds trading accounts in
the name of or controlled by Atwood Ltd. or Atwood S.A.

58, Defendantsâs solicitations were also false and misleading because Kardonick was not
a successful foreign currency options trader. Kardonickâs commodity futures and options trading
accounts reflect that from 2003 through September 2008, Kardonick sustained net trading losses
of approximately $1.7 million.

| 59. Defendants knowingly or with reckless disregard made the above-alleged material
misrepresentations or omissions. Atwood clients relied on these misrepresentations and
omissions in making their decisions to trade foreign currency options with Atwood.

4, Defendants Misappropriated Funds
60. Defendants accepted funds from Atwood clients for the purported purpose of

14
DEC Bl 2Qacel 6CCHDEOILEISMGNIP Docum@Be73! FiSEC12/O0/P4 SPARE ER24 = F-18725

trading foreign currency options.

61. Defendants misappropriated client funds for personal use and to make payments to
other Atwood clients.
B. Conclusions of Law

1. Jurisdiction and Venue

62. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2012),
which provides that whenever it shall appear to the Commission that any person has engaged, is
engaging, or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a violation of any provision of
the Act or any rule, regulation, or order promulgated thereunder, the Commission may bring an
action in the proper district court of the United States against such person to enjoin such act or
practice, or to enforce compliance with the Act, or any rule, regulation or order thereunder.

63. Venue properly lies with this Court pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
Â§ 13a-1(e) (2012), because the Defendants reside in this jurisdiction and the acts and practices in
violation of the Act occurred within this District.

2. Fraud by Misrepresentations and Omissions, False Account Statements, and
Misappropriation of Funds

64. By the conduct described in paragraphs 1 through 63 above, Defendants cheated
and defrauded, or attempted to cheat and defraud, and willfully deceived, or attempted to
deceive, their customers by, among other things, knowingly or recklessly making false,
deceptive, or misleading representations and omissions of material facts in their solicitations of

trading, by issuing false oral and written statements concerning the profitability of trading on
behalf of clients, and by misappropriating client funds in violation of 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6c(b) (2012),

and 17 C.F.R. 1,1(6)(1)-(3), and 32.9(2013).

15
DEC Bl 2@abel6:09Â¢cVOeOS2Â°RIS'MWP DocumÃ©AÃ©73! Filed12/68/4 âPagetesh24 =P - eves

65, Kardonick and Shapoff controlled Atwood, directly or indirectly, and did not act in
good faith or knowingly induced, directly or indirectly, Atwoodâs act or acts in violation of the Act and
Regulations; therefore, pursuant to 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13c(b) (2012), Kardonick and Shapoff are liable for
Atwoodâs violations of 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6Â¢(b) (2012), and 17 C.F.R. 1.1(6)(1)-(3), and 32.9(2013),

66. The foregoing acts, omissions, and failures of Kardonick and Shapoff occurred within
the scope of their employment, office, or agency with Atwood, therefore, pursuant to 7 U.S.C. Â§
2(a)(1)(B\(2012) and 17 C-F.R. Â§ 1.2 (2013), Atwood is liable for Kardonick and Shapoffâs acts,
omissions, and failures in violation of 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6c(b) (2012), and 17 C.F.R. 1.1(b)(1)-(3), and

32.9(2013).

Federal Court in New York Imposes a $2.16 Million Penalty and Permanent Trading Bans
against Michael A. Kardonick, Gary R. Shapoff, and Atwood & James for Forex Options
Fraud and Misappropriation

Kardonick and Shapoff Are Serving Time in Prison after Pleading Guilty
to Related Federal Criminal Charges

Washington DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced that a federal court in
Rochester, New York issued a consent Order against Atwood & James, Ltd. and Atwood & James, SA (collectively,
Atwood), which operated out of New York and Brazil, and Michael A. Kardonick, who maintained multiple residences in
Brooklyn; New York; Pembrook Pines, Florida; and Rio de Janeiro, and Gary R. Shapoff of Pittsford, New York. Kardonick
and Shapoff are currently incarcerated in Federal custody. The courtâs Order stems from a CFTC civil Complaint that
charged the Defendants with fraudulently soliciting retail clients to trade foreign currency (forex) options and charged
Atwood and Kardonick with misappropriating client funds (see CFTC Press Release and Complaint 5605-09, January 27,
2009). None of the Defendants has ever been registered with the CFTC, as required.

The consent Order, issued by the Honorable Charles Siragusa of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of New
York, assesses a civil monetary penalty against the Defendants of $2,164,059.57, recognizes the criminal restitution
award, and permanently bans Atwood, Shapoff, and Kardonick from registering, trading, soliciting and engaging in any
CFTC-regulated activity.

The CFTC Complaint alleged that, from at least 2001 to 2008, Defendants fraudulently solicited funds from members of
the general public located throughout the world, including the U.S. and the United Kingdom, to trade forex options.
Through an internet website and other means, the Defendants made extraordinary and false claims regarding, among
other things, Atwoodâs trading abilities.

In fact, according to the Order, Atwood and Kardonick were not successful traders; no trading accounts in the name of
Atwood or for the benefit of Atwood clients have been located; and, there was no evidence that Atwood had or has a
relationship with a clearing firm. The only known trading accounts were Kardonickâs personal trading accounts, which
from 2003 through September 2008 sustained net losses of approximately $1.7 million trading commodity futures and
options.

The courtâs Order also finds that Kardonick and Shapoff failed to disclose to clients that both have criminal convictions for
mail and wire fraud, and that Shapoff was the subject of two CFTC reparations actions in which the allegations included
misrepresentation, misuse of customer funds, nondisclosure, and order execution.

Related Criminal Acton

In a related criminal action brought by the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Western District of New York, Kardonick and
Shapoff pleaded guilty to charges of tax evasion and money laundering and are serving prison sentences of 120 months
for Kardonick and 60 months for Shapoff.

A criminal restitution order of $2,164,059.57 was issued against Kardonick and Shapoff, jointly and severally.

The CFTC cautions victims that restitution orders may not result in the recovery of money lost because the wrongdoers
may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers and to
ensure the wrongdoers are held accountable.

The CFTC appreciates the cooperation of the U.S. Attorneyâs Office, Western District of New York, the FBI Field Western
District of New York field office, the Brazilian Comissao de Valores Mobiliarios, and the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority in
this matter.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are James H. Holl lll, Katherine M. Driscoll, Kara
Mucha, Michelle Bougas, Rick Glaser, and Gretchen L. Lowe.

ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTIONS 6(c) AND 6(d) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, AS AMENDED,
MAKING FINDINGS AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

I.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionââ) has reason to believe that
from in or about January 2012 to at least February 2013 (the âRelevant Periodâ), Gold Coast
Bullion, Inc. (*GCBâ) and Anthony Lauria (âLauriaâ) (collectively âRespondentsâ) violated
Sections 4(a), 4b(a)(2)(A)-(C) and 4d, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§6(a), 6b(a)(2)(A)-(C), and 6d (2012).
Therefore, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest that public
administrative proceedings be,.and hereby are, instituted to determine whether Respondents
engaged in the violations set forth herein and to determine whether any order should be issued
imposing remedial sanctions.

Il.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Respondents have
submitted an Offer of Settlement (âOfferâ), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Without admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, Respondents consent to
the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 6(c) and 6(d) of the
Commodity Exchange Act, as Amended, Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions
(âOrderââ) and acknowledge service of this Order.'

 

' Respondents consent to the entry of this Order and to the use of these findings in this

proceeding and in any other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission
is a party; provided, however, that Respondents do not consent to the use of the Offer, or the
findings or conclusions in this Order consented to in the Offer, as the sole basis for any other
proceeding brought by the Commission, other than in a proceeding in bankruptcy or to enforce
the terms of this Order. Nor do Respondents consent to the use of the Offer or this Order, or the
findings or conclusions in this Order consented to in the Offer, by any other party in any other
proceeding.
Il.
The Commission finds the following:
A, SUMMARY

During the Relevant Period, GCB was a retail precious metals dealer that purportedly
sold physical precious metals to retail customers in financed transactions in which GCB would
arrange a loan. GCB, by and through its employees, and under the control of Lauria, solicited
retail investors by phone, internet website and interstate mail. However, GCB did not own,
possess or sell physical metals, nor did GCB arrange for loans to retail customers. Instead, GCB
transmitted orders for metals to AmeriFirst Management, LLC (âAMLâ), which simply made a
record of the transaction on its books, GCB then issued false purchase confirmations and
account statements to their retail customers. GCB was not registered with the Commission.
Therefore, Respondents engaged in illegal, off-exchange retail commodity transactions, made
fraudulent statements, and failed to register as a futures commission merchant, all in violation of
Sections 4(a), 4b(a)(2)(A)-(C) and 4d of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§86(a), 6b(a)(2)(A)-(C) and 6d.

B. RESPONDENTS

Gold Coast Bullion, Inc. is a Florida Corporation with its principal place of business at
6499 North Powerline Road, Suite 206, Fort Lauderdale, FL. GCB held itself out as a precious
metals broker that would sell physical precious metals to retail customers on a leveraged,
margined or financed basis. GCB solicited customers via phone and the internet. GCB has
never been registered with the Commission.

Anthony Lauria was the president and sole officer of GCB, as well as the agent for
service of process, Prior to forming, GCB Lauria was employed by at least four other
telemarketing firms that sold precious metals to retail customers on a leveraged, margined or
financed basis. At least one of those firms was the subject of an emergency action by the
Securities and Exchange Commission (âSECâ), although Lauria was only an employee at that
firm, Lauria has never been registered with the Commission.

C. OTHER RELEVANT ENTITY

AmeriFirst Management LLC is a Florida limited liability company formed in October
2011. It has never been registered with the Commission in any capacity, On its website, it
claimed to provide dealers with âtangible assets in a growing physical marketâ and âguarantee[s]
that every ounce of metal in [the dealerâs] customers [sic] account exists and is ready for delivery
at any point in time.â During the relevant period, AML executed and confirmed the execution of
retail commodity transactions involving gold, silver, and platinum through the United States
using a network of telemarketing solicitors, such as GCB, that it referred to as âdealers.â On
July 29, 2013, the CFTC filed a civil injunctive enforcement action in the U.S. District Court for
the Southern District of Florida against AML and its owners, charging them with marketing
illegal, off-exchange financed commodity transactions through a network of dealers and
fraudulently misrepresenting the nature of those transactions.

 
D. FACTS

During the relevant period, GCB was a telemarketing firm that solicited retail customers
to engage in financed precious metals transactions. Although GCB offered precious metals on a
fully paid basis, the vast majority of its business was in financed precious metals transactions.
This Order relates to the financed precious metals transactions executed through AML in which
customers were told that they would be purchasing precious metals with financing through a loan
from GCB and/or AML.

GCB conducted nearly all of its solicitations by telephone. Lauria, the controlling person
of GCB, directly solicited customers and supervised the other telemarketers involved in
solicitation. When soliciting customers for financed precious metals transactions executed
through AML, Lauria and the other GCB telemarketers represented that to purchase a certain
quantity of metal, the customer needed to deposit only a percentage of the total metal value,
typically 25%. GCB represented that the customer would receive a loan for the remaining 75%,
and that the customer would have to pay a finance charge on the loan, as well as a service
charge. In addition, in order to purchase the metal, GCB represented that the customer needed to
pay commission on the total metal value, with a maximum commission of 15%, and a mark-up
on the spot price of the metal, typically 3%.

If the customer agreed to the transaction, GCB confirmed the transaction in a recorded
call. In the course of this compliance call, the customer agreed to the quantity and price of the
precious metals, and agreed that GCB would provide a loan at a particular interest rate. GCB
would tell the customer that the transaction was a âspotâ transaction, and that the customer could
receive the physical metals as a result of their trade. GCB directed the customer to send a lump
sum to GCB, which represented the total of the 25% equity deposit, the commission amount, and
the mark-up amount. Upon receipt of those funds, GCB sent the funds in their entirety to AML.
AML then sent GCB any commission and fees due.

After receipt of sufficient funds from a customer, GCB would send the customer a trade
confirmation on its own letterhead. The trade confirmation showed that the customer purchased
the âTotal Ouncesâ of metal at a given price. GCB would also issue a âNotice of Allocationâ
which purported to show the total quantity of metals in a given transaction, as well as the trade
date. Thereafter, GCB would issue monthly statements, or allow customers access to account
information on line.

Neither GCB, nor AML bought, sold, loaned, stored, or transferred any physical metals
for these financed precious metals transactions. Likewise, neither GCB, nor AML actually
delivered any precious metals to any customers. Further, neither GCB nor AML made any loans
to customers to enable them to purchase precious metals. Instead, AML managed exposure on
these transactions using derivatives in margin trading accounts with several entities, and made
book entries which tracked the value of the customerâs account.

During the relevant period, GCB customers lost $5,940,124.16 in connection with the
retail financed precious metals transactions executed through AML. Of this, GCB received over
$2.6 million in commissions, and approximately $466,000.00 in additional charges.
IV.
LEGAL DISCUSSION
A. Relevant Statutory Background

Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010,
Public Law 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376 (2010) (âthe Dodd-Frank Actâ) amended the Commodity
Exchange Act to add, among other things, new authority over certain leveraged, margined, or
financed retail commodity transactions, including authority to prohibit fraud in connection with
such transactions.

Section 742(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act added Section 2(c)(2)(D) to the Act.â That
jurisdictional provision broadly applies to any agreement, contract, or transaction in any
commodity that is entered into with, or offered to (even if not entered into with), a non-eligible
contract participant (ânon-ECPâ)â or non-eligible commercial entity on a leveraged or margined
basis, or financed by the offeror, the counterparty, or a person acting in concert with the offeror
or counterparty on a similar basis. 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(c)(2)(D)(i). Section 2(c)(2)(D) further provides
that such an agreement, contract, or transaction shall be subject to Sections 4(a), 4(b), and 4b of

the Act âas if the agreement, contract, or transaction was a contract of sale of a commodity for
future delivery.â 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(c)(2)(D)(iii).

Section 2(c)(2)(D)(il) of the Act excepts certain transactions from Section 2(c)(2)(D).
Section 2(c)(2)(D)(1i)(II1)(aa) excepts a contract of sale that results in âactual deliveryâ within 28
days ....Â°* As found by the Eleventh Circuit, the term âactual deliveryâ is unambiguous, and is -
therefore given its ordinary meaning. âDeliveryâ is â[t]he formal act of transferring somethingâ;
it denotes a transfer of possession and control.â CFTC v. Hunter Wise Commodities, LLC, 749
F.3d 967, 978-9 (11"" Cir. 2014), citing Blackâs Law Dictionary 494 (9"""" ed, 2009). As such,
ââTalctual deliveryâ denotes â[t]he act of giving real and immediate possession to the buyer or the
buyerâs agent.ââ Jd âActual deliveryâ is distinct from âconstructive delivery.â See Jd. (holding
that âthe electronic transfer of documents indicating control or possession effectuates delivery
without physical transfer of the commodityâis by any definition constructive, rather than
actual,â); see also Blackâs Law Dictionary 494 (9"" ed, 2009) (defining âconstructive deliveryâ as
âTaln act that amounts to a transfer of title by operation of law when actual transfer is impractical
or impossibleâ). âActualâ is that which âexist[s] in factâ and is âreal,â rather than constructive.
Id. at 40.

 

* Section 2(c)(2)(D) of the Act became effective July 16, 2011.

Â° As is relevant to this matter, Section 1a(18)(xi) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1la(18)(xi), defines an
eligible contract participant as an individual who has amounts invested on a discretionary basis,
the ageregate of which is in excess of $10,000,000, or which is in excess of $5,000,000 and who
enters into the agreement, contract, or transaction in order to manage the risk associated with an
asset owned or liability incurred, or reasonably likely to be owned or incurred, by the individual.

* The Commission has not adopted any regulations permitting a longer actual delivery period for
any commodity pursuant to Section 2(c)(2)(D)(ii)(ID(aa) of the Act. Accordingly, the 28 day
actual delivery period set forth in this provision remains applicable to all commodities.

 
The Commissionâs view complements the Eleventh Circuitâs definition. The
Commission has stated that the determination of whether âactual deliveryâ has occurred within
the meaning of Section 2(c)(2)(D)ii)(IID)(aa) requires consideration of evidence beyond the four
corners of the contract documents. In determining whether actual delivery has occurred within
28 days, the Commission employs a functional approach to assess whether there has been a âreal
and immediateâ transfer of âpossession and controlâ to the âbuyer or the buyerâs agentâ of the
commodity. The Commission examines how the agreement, contract, or transaction is marketed,
managed, and performed. Ownership, possession, title, and physical location, as well as the
relationships between the buyer, seller, and possessor of the commodity, and the manner in
which the sale is recorded and completed are all relevant considerations in determining whether
there has been actual delivery. Thus, physical delivery of the entire quantity of the commodity,
including the portion purchased using leverage, margin or financing, into the possession of the
buyer, or a depository other than the seller, the sellerâs parent company, partners, agents and
affiliates will satisfy the actual delivery exception, provided that the purported delivery is not a
sham.

Congress did not express any intent to limit the reach of Section 2(c)(2)(D). Rather, in
enacting the statute Congress expressed its intent that Section 2(c)(2)(D) should be applicable to
a broad range of agreements, contracts, and transactions.

B. The Commissionâs Jurisdiction

Respondents offered precious metals transactions to, and entered into such transactions
with, persons who were not eligible contract participants or eligible commercial entities.
Generally, Respondentsâ customers were unsophisticated, individual investors who did not meet
the $10 million discretionary investment threshold to be considered ECPs. Moreover,
Respondents offered and entered into such transactions on a margined or leveraged basis, or
financed by GCB, or AML acting in concert with GCB. Respondentsâ retail financed precious
metals transactions fall squarely within the Commissionâs jurisdiction under Section 2(c)(2)(D)
of the Act.

Respondentsâ retail-financed precious metals transactions executed through AML did not
result in actual delivery to the customer. Respondents did not transfer possession and control of
any precious metals to their customers. Therefore, Respondentsâ transactions are not excepted
from the Commissionâs jurisdiction under Section 2(c)(2)(D)(ii)(1H)(aa) of the Act.

Cc. Respondents Violated Section 4(a) of the Act: Hlegal, Off-Exchange Transactions

As stated above, retail commodity transactions within the scope of Section 2(c)(2)(D) of
the Act are subject to enforcement under Section 4(a) of the Act, among other provisions, as if
such transactions are commodity futures contracts. Section 4(a) of the Act makes it unlawful for
any person to offer to enter into, enter into, execute, confirm the execution of, or conduct an
office or business in the United States for the purpose of soliciting, or accepting any order for, or

 

Â° See Retail Commodity Transactions Under Commodity Exchange Act, 78 Fed. Reg. 52,426
(Aug. 23, 2013).

 
otherwise dealing in any transaction in, or in connection with, a commodity futures contract,
unless such transaction is made on or subject to the rules of a board of trade that has been
designated or registered by the CFTC as a contract market or derivatives transaction execution
facility for the specific commodity.

Respondents offered to enter into, entered into, and confirmed the execution of retail
financed precious metals transactions. Respondents also conducted an office and business in the
United States for the purpose of soliciting, accepting orders for, and otherwise dealing in retail
financed precious metals transactions. None of the retail financed precious metals transactions
were conducted on or subject to the rules of a board of trade that has been designated or
registered by the CFTC as a contract market or derivatives transaction execution facility for
precious metals. Respondents therefore violated Section 4(a) of the Act.

D. Respondents Violated Sections 4b(a)(2)(A)-(C) by Committing Fraud in Connection
with Retail Commodity Transactions

Section 4b(a)(2)(A)-(C) of the Act prohibits all manner of fraud and false statements in or
in connection with retail commodity transactions, including fraudulent solicitation and
misappropriation. Section 4b(a)(2)(A)-(C) provides that it is unlawful:

for any person, in or in connection with any order to make, or the
making of, any contract of sale of any commodity in interstate
commerce or for future delivery ... that is made, or to be made,
for or on behalf of, or with, any other person, other than on or
subject to the rules of a designated contract market-- (A) to cheat
or defraud or attempt to cheat or defraud the other person,

(B) willfully to make or cause to be made to the other person any
false report or statement or willfully to enter or cause to be entered
for the other person any false record, [or] (C) willfully to deceive
or attempt to deceive the other person by any means whatsoever in
regard to any order or contract or the disposition or execution of
any order or contract, or in regard to any act of agency performed,
with respect to any order or contract for or, in the case of
paragraph (2), with the other person... .

Pursuant to Section 2(c)(2)(D)(iii) of the Act, Section 4b of the Act applies to the retail
commodity transactions conducted by Respondents and offered to, or entered into with, non-
ECPs on a leveraged, margined or financed basis, âas ifâ they were a contract of sale for a
commodity for future delivery.

To establish that Respondents violated Section 4b(a)(2)(A)-(C) of the Act, the
Commission must prove that (1) a misrepresentation has occurred; (2) with scienter; and (3) the
misrepresentation was material. CFTC y, RJ. Fitzgerald & Co,, 310 F.3d 1321, 1328-29 (11th
Cir. 2002) cert, denied, 543 U.S. 1034 (2004); CFTC v. Hunter Wise Commodities, LLC, -- F.
Supp. 2d --, [Current Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) 4 33,150; 2014 WL 2022239
*15 (S.D. Fla., May 16, 2014). âWhether a misrepresentation has been made depends on the
overall message and the common understanding of the information conveyed.â RJ. Fitzgerald

 
& Co., 310 F.3d at 1328 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). A statement or
omission is material if âa reasonable customer would consider it important in deciding whether
to make an investment.â Jd. at 1328-29. In order to meet the scienter requirement, the
Commission must demonstrate that a defendant committed the alleged wrongful acts
âmtentionally or with reckless disregard for his duties under the Act.â Drexel Burnham Lambert,
Inc. v. CFTC, 850 F.2d 742, 748 (D.C. Cir, 1988) (finding that recklessness is sufficient to
satisfy scienter requirement). To prove that conduct is intentional, the Commission need only
show that a defendantâs actions were âintentional as opposed to accidental.â Lawrence v. CFTC,
759 F. 2d 767, 773 (9th Cir. 1985). To prove that conduct is reckless, the Commission must
show that it âdeparts so far from the standards of ordinary care that it is very difficult to believe
the [actor] was not aware of what he was doing.â Drexel Burnham Lambert, 850 F.2d at 748
(alteration in original) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), Do v. Lind-Waldock &
Co. [1994-1996 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) J 26,516, 1995 CFTC LEXIS 247,
at *4 (CFTC Sept. 27, 1995) (determining that a reckless act is one that âdeparts so far from the
standards of ordinary care that it is very difficult to believe the [actor] was not aware of what he
was doingâ) (quoting Drexel Burnham Lambert, 850 F.2d at 848); see also CFTC vy. Noble
Metals Int'l, Inc., 67 F.3d 766, 774 ch Cir. 1995) (âMere negligence, mistake, or inadvertence
fails to meet Section 4bâs scienter requirement.ââ).

By falsely representing to customers of GCB that they were, in fact, purchasing physical
precious metals and receiving loans, Respondents committed fraud in connection with its retail
commodity transactions in violation of Section 4b(a)(2)(A) and (C). Further, when Respondents
sent documents to GCB customers which confirmed the purchase or sale of physical precious
metals Respondents made false reports or statements in connection with these retail commodity
transactions in violation of Section 4b(a)(2)(B) of the Act.

E. GCB Violated Section 4d by Failing to Register as a Futures Commission Merchant

Section 4d of the Act requires all persons acting as futures commission merchants
(âFCMâ) to register with the Commission. Section 1a(28) of the Act defines a FCM, in relevant
part, as an individual, partnership, corporation or trust, that is engaged in soliciting or accepting
orders for retail commodity transactions, or that accepts money in connection with such
transactions. See 7 U.S.C, Â§1a(28)(i)(1)(aa)(DD). See also CFTC v. Hunter Wise Commodities,
et al., 1 F.Supp.3d 1311 (S.D. Fla. 2014) (entering summary judgment against Hunter Wise for
failing to register as an FCM).

Respondents solicited retail customers to enter into retail commodity transactions,
accepted orders for retail commodity transactions, and received funds from those customers in
connection with retail commodity transactions. Respondents were not, however, registered with
the Commission. Therefore, Respondents violated Section 4d of the Act.

F, GCB Is Liable for the Violations of its Agents

GCB is liable for the violations of its agents, including Lauria and other employees.
Under Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(a)(1)(B), as well as Regulation 1.2, 17 C.F.R.
Â§ 1.2, a principal is strictly liable for the violations of its agents made within the scope of the
agentsâ employment. Rosenthal & Co. v, CFTC, 802 F.2d 963, 966 (7th Cir. 1986). Lauria,

 
along with other GCB telemarketers, were agents of GCB, and in the scope of their employment
they violated Section 4(a) and 4b of the Act. GCB is therefore liable for these violations.

G. Lauria is Liable as the Controlling Person Under Section 13(b) of the Act for GCBâs
Violations

Lauria is directly liable for violations of Section 4(a) and 4b of the Act. In addition,
Lauria directly controlled GCB and directly and knowingly induced GCBâs conduct constituting
violations of the Act; therefore, pursuant to Section 13(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13c(b), Lauria is
liable for GCBâs violations of Section 4(a) of the Act. Section 13(b) of the Act states that a
controlling person of an entity is liable for the violations of that entity, provided that the
controlling person knowingly induced, directly or indirectly, the violations, or provided that the
controlling person did not act in good faith. âA fundamental purpose of Section 13b [sic] is to
allow the Commission to reach behind the corporate entity to the controlling individuals of the
corporation and to impose liability for violations of the Act directly on such individuals as well
as the corporation itself.â RJ. Fitzgerald & Co., Inc., 310 F.3d at 1334 (internal quotation marks
and citation omitted).

To establish controlling person liability under Section 13(b), the Division must show both
(1) control; and (2) lack of good faith or knowing inducement of the acts constituting the
violation. In re First Nat'l Trading Corp., [1992-1994 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep.
(CCH) Â§ 26,142 at 41,787 (CFTC Jul. 20, 1994), aff'd without opinion sub nom. Pick vy, CFTC,
99 F.3d 1139 (6th Cir. 1996). To establish the first element, control, a defendant must possess
general control over the operation of the entity principally liable. See, e.g., RJ. Fitzgerald, 310
F.3d at 1334 (recognizing an individual who âexercised the ultimate choice-making power
within the firm regarding its business decisionsâ as a controlling person). Evidence that a
defendant is an officer, founder, principal, or the authorized signatory on the companyâs bank
accounts indicates the power to control a company. Jn re Spiegel, [1987-1990 Transfer Binder]
Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) Â¢ 24,103 at 34,767 (CFTC Jan. 12, 1988). The Division must also
show that a defendant possessed specific control, which is âthe power or ability to control the
specific transaction or activity upon which the primary violation was predicated.â Monieson v
CFTC, 996 F.2d 852, 860 (7th Cir. 1993) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The
defendant does not need to participate in or benefit from the wrongdoing; the issue is whether the
defendant has the power to address the illegal conduct. /d. (finding that, in a trade allocation
case, the fact that the defendant could fire or discipline responsible employees, end the
placement of orders without numbers as soon as the defendant knew of it, or order a full
investigation was sufficient to show specific control).

With respect to control, Lauria was the sole owner and operator of GCB. He managed
the day to day operations, supervising the solicitation of retail customers and engaging in
solicitations himself. Lauria was the ultimate decision maker and controlled all aspects of
GCBâs business. Lauria had both general control over GCBâs business and specific control over
the conduct underlying GCBâs violations.

In addition to control, the Division must show the controlling person knowingly induced,
directly or indirectly, the acts constituting the violation or did not act in good faith. To show
knowing inducement, the Division must show that a defendant had actual or constructive

 
knowledge of the core activities that constituted the violation and allowed the activities to
continue, In re Spiegel, [1987-1990 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) at 34,767. To
show lack of good faith, the Division must show that a defendant did not have an adequate
system of internal supervision, or that a defendant did not enforce such system with reasonable
diligence. Monieson, 996 F.2d at 860.

Lauria knew that the basic nature or essence of GCBâs business was in off-exchange,
retail financed precious metals transactions. Lauria further knew that neither GCB nor AML
purchased or held actual physical precious metals, and that no loans were made in connection
with any retail commodity transactions. Lauria further failed to register GCB with the
Commission as an FCM. Thus, Lauria knowingly induced the conduct in violation of Sections
A(a), 4b and 4d of the Act.

V.
FINDINGS OF VIOLATION

Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that, during the Relevant Period, GCB and
Anthony Lauria violated Sections 4(a), 4b(a)(2)(A)-(C), and 4d of the Act.

VI.

VIL

ORDER

Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT:

A,

Respondents shall cease and desist from violating Sections 4(a), 4b(a)(2)(A)-(C), and 4d
of the Act.

Respondents, jointly and severally, shall pay restitution in the amount of five million,
nine hundred forty thousand, one hundred twenty four dollars and sixteen cents
($5,940,124.16) (âRestitution Obligationâ). Post-judgment interest shall accrue on the
Restitution Obligation beginning on the date of entry of this Order and shall be
determined by using the Treasury Bill rate prevailing on the date of entry of this Order
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1961 (2006).

To effect payment by Respondents and the distribution of restitution to Respondentsâ
customers, the Commission appoints the NFA as âMonitor.â The Monitor shall collect
payments of the Restitution Obligation from Respondents and make distributions as set
forth below. Because the Monitor is not being specially compensated for these services,
and these services are outside the normal duties of the Monitor, it shall not be liable for
any action or inaction arising from its appointment as Monitor other than actions
involving fraud.

Respondents shall make payments of the Restitution Obligation under this Order in the
name of the âGold Coast Bullion, Inc.âs Settlement Fundâ and shall send such payments
by electronic funds transfer, or U.S. postal money order, certified check, bank cashierâs
check, or bank money order to the Office of Administration, National Futures
Association, 300 South Riverside Plaza, Suite 1800, Chicago, Illinois 60606, under a
cover letter that identifies the paying Respondent and the name and docket number of this
proceeding. The paying Respondent shall simultaneously transmit copies of the cover
letter and the form of payment to the Chief Financial Officer, Commodity Futures
Trading Commission, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street, NW, Washington, D.C.
20581.

The Monitor shall oversee Respondentsâ Restitution Obligation and shall have the
discretion to determine the manner of distribution of funds in an equitable fashion to the
Respondentsâ customers or may defer distribution until such time as the Monitor may
deem appropriate. In the event that the amount of payments of the Restitution Obligation
to the Monitor are of a de minimis nature such that the Monitor determines that the
administrative cost of making a restitution distribution is impractical, the Monitor may, in
its discretion, treat such restitution payments as civil monetary penalty payments, which
the Monitor shall forward to the Commission, as discussed below. To the extent any
funds accrue to the U.S. Treasury for satisfaction of Respondentsâ Restitution Obligation,
such funds shall be transferred to the Monitor for disbursement in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this Order,

1]

 
Respondents, jointly and severally, shall pay a civil monetary penalty in the amount of
three million, seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars ($3,750,000.00) (the âCMP
Obligationâ). Post-judgment interest shall accrue on the CMP Obligation beginning on
the date of entry of this Order and shall be determined by using the Treasury Bill rate
prevailing on the date of entry of this Order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1961 (2006).
Respondents shall pay the CMP Obligation by electronic funds transfer, U.S. postal
money order, certified check, bank cashierâs check, or bank money order. If payment is
to be made other than by electronic funds transfer, then the payment shall be made
payable to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and sent to the address below:

CFTC Orders Florida Resident Anthony Lauria and His Company Gold Coast Bullion, Inc. to
Pay More than $9.6 Million in Restitution and a Civil Monetary Penalty in Off-Exchange
Precious Metals Fraud

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today entered an Order filing and
simultaneously settling charges against Anthony Lauria and his company, Gold Coast Bullion, Inc. (GCB), operating
out of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, for engaging in illegal, off-exchange precious metals transactions, for committing fraud in
connection with those illegal transactions, and for operating GCB as an unregistered Futures Commission Merchant
(FCM).

The CFTC Order requires Lauria and GCB jointly to pay restitution totaling $5,940,124.16 and a civil monetary penalty of
$3.75 million. In addition, the Order imposes permanent registration and trading bans on Lauria and GCB.

The CFTC Order finds that, from at least January 2012 to February 2013, GCB was a telemarketing firm that solicited
retail customers to engage in financed precious metals transactions. The Order further finds that Lauria solicited
customers directly and supervised other telemarketers involved in solicitation.

When soliciting customers for financed precious metals transactions, Lauria and other GCB telemarketers represented
that to purchase a certain quantity of metal, 1) the customer needed to deposit only a percentage of the total metal
value, typically 25 percent, 2) that GCB would arrange for the customer to receive loan for the remaining 75 percent, and
3) that the customer would have to pay a finance charge on the loan, as well as a service charge, according to the Order.

As the Order finds, financed transactions in commodities with retail customers, like those in which GCB engaged, must be
executed on or subject to the rules of an exchange approved by the CFTC, which GCB did not do. In addition, the Order
finds that GCB accepted money from or extended credit to its customers to margin, guarantee, or secure trades when it
was not registered with the CFTC as an FCM. Finally, the Order finds that GCB never actually delivered any precious
metals in connection with these transactions, but received commissions and fees totaling more than $2.6 million.

According to the CFTC Order, GCB did not purchase or sell any physical metals, but instead contacted another company,
AmeriFirst Management LLC (AML), to execute the customersâ buy or sell orders. The CFTC Order states that GCB
then confirmed the execution of the transactions by issuing false trade confirmations to the customers. The CFTC Order
further states that AML, for its part, also did not purchase or sell any physical metals in connection with these
transactions. AML managed its own exposure on these transactions using derivatives in margin trading accounts with
several entities, and made book entries which tracked the value of the customerâs account, according to the Order.

On July 30, 2013, the CFTC sued AML in federal court in Florida, charging it with engaging in illegal, off-exchange precious
metals transactions, fraud, and other violations (see CFTC Press Release 6655-13). On July 24, 2014, the court entered a
supplemental consent Order against AML and the three individual Defendants in that case requiring them to pay more
than $25 million in restitution and $10 million in civil monetary penalties (See CFTC Press Release 6973-14).

The CFTC cautions victims that restitution orders may not result in the recovery of money lost because the wrongdoers
may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers and to
ensure the wrongdoers are held accountable.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this action include Thaddeus Glotfelty, Judith McCorkle,
Joseph Konizeski, Scott Williamson, and Rosemary Hollinger.

Appendix to Plaintiff's Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Its
Application for Ex Parte Statutory Restraining Order and Motion for a Preliminary
Injunction,

THE COURT FINDS:

1. This Court has jurisdiction over the parties and subject matter of this
action. Section 6c of the Commodity Exchange Act (âActâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§13a-1(a)
(2012), authorizes this Court to enter an ex parte statutory restraining order against
Defendants Christopher Valois (Valois), Cynthia Wong (âWongâ), Bertram Trade
LLC (âBertram Tradeâ) and Churchhill Commodities Trading LLC (ââChurchhillâ)
(collectively âDefendantsâ).

2. Venue properly lies with this Court pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the
Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(e).

3. It appears that there is good cause to believe that Defendants have
engaged, are engaging, or are about to engage in violations of the Act. Specifically,
it appears that Defendants have engaged, are engaging, or are about to engage in
violations of Sections 4(a) and 4b(a)(2)(A) and (C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6(a) and
6b(a)(2)(A) and (C), and that Defendants Valois and Wong also have engaged, are

engaging, or are about to engage in violations of Sections 4b(a)(1)(A) and (C),

40(1)(A) and (B) (2012),

4, It further appears that there is good cause to believe immediate and
irreparable harm to the Courtâs ability to grant effective final relief to Defendantsâ
customers in the form of monetary redress will occur from the sale, transfer,
assignment, or other disposition by Defendantsâ assets or destruction of books
and records unless they are immediately restrained and enjoined by order of the
Court. Accordingly, there is good cause to issue this Order.

5. Consequently, the Court is satisfied that this is a proper case for
granting an ex parte statutory restraining order to preserve the status quo and to
protect public investors from further fraud, deceit, loss or damage, and enable the
Commission to fulfill its statutory duties. It further appears that the interest of
Justice requires that the ex parte application be heard without notice and that the

notice requirement of L.R. 7-19.1 is waived.

CFTC Charges California Residents Christopher Valois and Cynthia Wong and Their
Companies with Fraud and Registration Violations

Husband and wife team allegedly stole more than $300,000 of the
$750,000 their customers invested

Federal court enters emergency Order freezing Defendantsâ assets and
protecting books and records

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced that Judge Cormac J.
Carney of the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered an emergency restraining Order freezing
assets and prohibiting the destruction or concealment of books and records of Defendants Christopher Valois, Cynthia
Wong, and their companies, Bertram Trade LLC (Bertram) and Churchhill Commodities Trading LLC (Churchhill),
all of Orange County California. The judge set a hearing date for February 12, 2015.

The courtâs Order arises from a CFTC Complaint filed on January 28, 2015, charging the Defendants with precious metals
and futures fraud, misappropriation, engaging in illegal off-exchange precious metals transactions, and registration
violations, in violation of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC Regulations from October 2011 to the present.

According to the Complaint, husband and wife Valois and Wong, acting by and through Bertram and Churchhill,
fraudulently solicited approximately $450,000 from six customers, some of whom were senior citizens, to purchase
precious metals or engage in futures trading. The Complaint states that the precious metals transactions offered by
Valois and Wong and their companies were illegal off-exchange instruments and alleges that Valois and Wong
misappropriated more than $300,000 of customer money to pay their personal expenses.

The Complaint also alleges that Valois and Wong acted as Commodity Trading Advisors by trading another $300,000 of at
least four members of the general public in futures contracts and receiving advisory fees for such futures trading, even
though they were not registered with the CFTC, as required. In fact, Valois previously had been banned from the futures
industry for cheating and defrauding customers, according to the Complaint.

In its continuing litigation, the CFTC seeks restitution, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, civil monetary penalties, trading
and registration bans, and a permanent injunction against further violations of federal commodities laws, as charged.

The CFTC appreciates the cooperation of the National Futures Association in this matter.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Camille Arnold, Joseph Patrick, Robert Howell,
Scott Williamson, and Rosemary Hollinger.

Federal Court Orders U.S. Bank National Association to Pay $18 Million to Peregrine
Customers

U.S. Bank held the Peregrine Financial Group, Inc. customer segregated
funds account that Russell Wasendorf, Sr. used to misappropriate
customer funds

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced that on February 4, 2015,
Chief Judge Linda R. Reade of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of lowa entered a Consent Order imposing a
permanent injunction against U.S. Bank National Association (U.S. Bank) and ordering the bank to pay $18 million
dollars to be returned to Peregrine Financial Group, Inc. (Peregrine) customers.

At the time of its failure in July 2012, Peregrine was the nationâs second largest non-bank, non-clearing Futures
Commission Merchant (FCM). U.S. Bank maintains branch offices in Cedar Falls, lowa, where Peregrine and its owner,
Russell Wasendorf, Sr. (Wasendorf), were located. U.S. Bank was a depository for Peregrine and held a customer
segregated funds account that Wasendorf used to defraud more than 24,000 Peregrine clients and misappropriate over
$215 million of customersâ money. On July 10, 2012, the CFTC instituted a civil action against Wasendorf and Peregrine,
CFTC v. Peregrine Financial Group, Inc. and Russell Wasendorf, Sr., 12-cv-05383 (N.D.IL July 10, 2012) (see CFTC Press
Release and CFTC Complaint 6300-12). Wasendorf was also criminally charged, pled guilty, and on January 23, 2013 was
sentenced to 50 years in prison and ordered to pay more than $215 million in restitution. U.S. v. Russell Wasendorf, Sr.,
12-cr-2021(N.D.IA).

During the relevant period of the CFTCâs action, June 2008 through July 2012, Wasendorf withdrew and transferred
approximately $36 million from the US Bank customer segregated funds account to persons and entities that were not
Peregrine customers and U.S. Bank regularly withdrew its account fees from the customer segregated funds account for
both Peregrine and non-Peregrine accounts held at the bank.

The Order enjoins U.S. Bank from committing future violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and the CFTCâs
Regulations that prohibit any depository institution, like U.S. Bank, from holding, disposing of, or using funds that belong
to customers of an FCM as though they belong to anyone other than the customers, and also prohibit the extension of
credit based on such funds to anyone other than the customers.

The Order also requires U.S. Bank to pay $18 million to the court-appointed Trustee for Peregrine in /n re Peregrine
Financial Group, Inc., BK Case No. 12-27488 (N.D.IL) that will be returned to Peregrine customers that held domestic
futures accounts.

CFTC Director of Enforcement Aitan Goelman stated: âRussell Wasendorf stole enormous sums of money that Peregrineâs
customers entrusted to him. He is responsible for his crimes. However, that fact does not excuse U.S. Bankâs failure to
meet its own responsibilities to safeguard Peregrineâs customer funds that it held. As this litigation and its resolution
demonstrate, the CFTC will be relentless in pursuing recovery on behalf of innocent investors.â

The courtâs Order arises from a Complaint filed by the CFTC on June 5, 2013 charging U.S. Bank with improperly holding
and using a Peregrine customer segregated funds account by treating the account like a regular business checking
account, thereby allowing Wasendorf to withdraw customer money for non-customer purposes from June 2008 through
July 2012 (see CFTC Press Release and Complaint 6601-13, June 5, 2013).

In the Order, the parties adopt the undisputed facts from the courtâs November 19, 2014 Summary Judgment Order (see
Order under Related Links). There the court found that on August 3, 1992, Peregrine opened an account at a predecessor
to U.S. Bank and designated the account a âPeregrine Financial Group, Inc. Customer Segregated Account.â U.S. Bank
provided two letters to Peregrine acknowledging the account contained customer money, would be properly segregated,
and maintained in accordance with the CEA. However, during the relevant period alleged in the CFTC Complaint, no U.S.
Bank employee that had responsibility for the customer segregated funds account understood that the account was a
customer segregated funds account or understood the meaning of that account designation. At that time, U.S. Bank had
no policies, procedures or training specifically applicable to FCM customers or customer segregated funds. During the
relevant period, Wasendorf withdrew approximately $36 million to persons and entities that were not Peregrine
customers and U.S. Bank regularly withdrew its account fees from the customer segregated funds account for both
Peregrine and non-Peregrine accounts held at the bank.

After the CFTC initiated its investigation in July 2012, U.S. Bank implemented new policies and procedures specifically
applicable to FCM customer segregated funds accounts.
CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this action are Robert Howell, Susan Gradman, Joy
McCormack, Stephanie Reinhart, Ashley Burden, Jennifer Diamond, Jon Kramer, Elizabeth Pendleton, Scott Williamson,
and Rosemary Hollinger.

ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTIONS 6(c) AND 6(d) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, AS AMENDED,
MAKING FINDINGS AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

I.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (ââCommissionâ or âCFTCâ) has reason to
believe that from in or about July 16, 2011 through March 2013 (the ârelevant periodâ), Midwest
Metals Exchange, LLC (âMidwestâ) and its controlling person, Brian Steven Ekasala
(âEkasalaâ) (collectively âRespondentsâ), violated Section 4(a) of the Commodity Exchange Act
(âActâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6(a) (2012). Therefore, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the
public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted to determine
whether Respondents engaged in violations set forth herein, and to determine whether any order
should be issued imposing remedial sanctions.

I.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Respondents have
submitted an Offer of Settlement (âOfferâ), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Without admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, Respondents consent to
the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 6(c) and 6(d) of the
Commodity Exchange Act, Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (âOrderâ) and
acknowledge service of this Order.â

 

' Respondents consent to the entry of this Order and to the use of these findings in this

proceeding and in any other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission
is a party; provided, however, that Respondents do not consent to the use of the Offer, or the
findings or conclusions in this Order consented to in the Offer, as the sole basis for any other
proceeding brought by the Commission, other than in a proceeding in bankruptcy or to enforce
(Footnote continued)

 
III,
The Commission finds the following:
A, SUMMARY

During the relevant period, Respondents violated Section 4(a) of the Act by offering to
enter into, entering into, confirming the execution of, and conducting an office and business in
the United States for the purpose of soliciting, accepting orders for, and otherwise dealing in
illegal, off-exchange retail commodity transactions. Specifically, the transactions were financed
precious metals transactions with individual investors. Ekasala is directly liable for such
violations, and he is also liable as the controlling person of Midwest. For these transactions,
Midwest received commissions and fees totaling $322,852.71.

B. RESPONDENTS

Midwest Metals Exchange, LLC is a Florida limited liability company formed in
January 2010 and it has been inactive since September 2014. Its principal place of business was
Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Midwest was a telemarketing firm that solicited retail customers to
invest in financed precious metals transactions. Midwest has never been registered with the
Commission in any capacity. |

Brian Steven Ekasala is a resident of Lake Worth, Florida, Ekasala was the owner,
operator, and controlling person of Midwest. Ekasala was intermittently registered with the
Commission as an associated person between 1992 and 2008.

Cc, OTHER RELEVANT ENTITY

Hunter Wise Commodities, LLC (âHunter Wiseâ) was formed as a California limited
liability company in July 2007 but was converted to a Nevada limited liability company in
October 2010. It held itself out on its website as âa physical commodity trading company,
wholesaler, market maker, back-office support provider, and finance company.â During the
relevant period, Hunter Wise executed and confirmed the execution of retail commodity
transactions involving gold, silver, platinum, palladium, and copper throughout the United States
using a network of telemarketing solicitors, such as Midwest, that it referred to as âdealers.â

D. FACTS

During the relevant period, Midwest was a telemarketing firm that solicited retail
customers to engage in financed precious metals transactions, Although Midwest also offered
precious metals and coins on a fully paid basis, the vast majority of its business was in financed

 

the terms of this Order. Nor do Respondents consent to the use of the Offer or this Order, or the
findings or conclusions in this Order consented to in the Offer, by any other party in any other
proceeding.

 
precious metals transactions. This Order relates to the financed precious metals transactions
executed through Hunter Wise.

Midwest telemarketers conducted nearly all of their solicitations by telephone. Ekasala,
the controlling person of Midwest, directly solicited customers of his own and supervised other
telemarketers involved in customer solicitations, When soliciting customers for financed
precious metals transactions executed through Hunter Wise, Ekasala and the other Midwest
telemarketers represented that to purchase a specific quantity of metal, the customer was required to
deposit thirty percent of the total metal value. Midwest represented that the customer would
receive a loan for the remaining percentage (e.g., 70%), and that the customer would have to pay
a finance charge on the loan. In addition, for each metal purchase, Midwest charged customers a
sales commission that ranged as high as thirty percent on the total metal value and a mark-up
on the spot price of the subject metal.

If the customer agreed to the transaction, Midwest confirmed the transaction and
directed the customer to send Midwest a lump sum payment, which represented the deposit on
the value of the total metal purchased, the commission amount, and the mark-up amount.

Upon receipt of those funds, Midwest sent the funds in their entirety to Hunter Wise, Hunter
Wise then remitted the commission and fees due back to Midwest. During the relevant period,
Midwest received $322,852.71 in commissions and fees for the retail financed precious metals
transactions the firm executed through Hunter Wise.

Neither Midwest nor Hunter Wise bought, sold, loaned, stored, or transferred any
physical metals for these financed precious metals transactions. Likewise, neither Midwest,
nor Hunter Wise actually delivered any precious metals to any customers. Instead, Hunter
Wise managed exposure on these transactions using derivatives in margin trading accounts
with several entities. CFTC v. Hunter Wise Commodities, LLC, No, 12-81311-CIV, 749 F.3d
967 (S.D. Fla. May 22, 2014),

IV.
LEGAL DISCUSSION
A, Relevant Statutory Background

Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010,
Public Law 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376 (2010) (""the Dodd-Frank Act"") amended the Commodity
Exchange Act to add, among other things, new authority over certain leveraged, margined, or
financed retail commodity transactions, including authority to prohibit fraud in connection with
such transactions.

Section 742(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act added Section 2(c)(2)(D) to the Act.â Section
2(c)(2)(D) broadly applies to any agreement, contract, or transaction in any commodity that is
entered into with, or offered to (even if not entered into with), a non-eligible contract

 

* Section 2(c)(2)(D) of the Act became effective July 16, 2011.

 
participant (""non-ECP"") or non-eligible commercial entity on a leveraged or margined basis,
or financed by the offeror, the counterparty, or a person acting in concert with the offeror or
counterparty on a similar basis. 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(c)(2)(D)(i). Section 2(c)(2)(D) further provides
that such an agreement, contract, or transaction shall be subject to Sections 4(a), 4(b), and 4b
of the Act ""as if the agreement, contract, or transaction was a contract of sale of a commodity
for future delivery.â 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(c)2)(D)Giii).

Section 2(c)(2)(D)(it) of the Act, excepts certain transactions from Section 2(c)(2)(D).
Section 2(c)(2)(D)qi)(I])(aa) excepts a contract of sale that ""results in actual delivery within
28 days or such other longer period as the Commission may determine by rule or regulation
based upon the typical commercial practice in cash or spot markets for the commodity
involved.""* Section 2(c)(2)(D)(ii)(III)(bb) excepts a contract of sale that creates an
enforceable obligation to deliver between a seller and a buyer that have the ability to deliver
and accept delivery, respectively, in connection with the line of business of the seller and
buyer.

The Commission has stated that the determination of whether ""actual delivery"" has
occurred within the meaning of Section 2(c)(2)(D)(ii)(I1D(aa) requires a consideration of
evidence beyond the four corners of the contract documents. This interpretation of the
statutory language is based on Congress's use of the word ""actual"" to modify ""delivery"" and
on the legislative history of Section 2(c)(2)(D)Gi)(ID) (aa). Consistent with this interpretation,
in determining whether actual delivery has occurred within 28 days, the Commission employs
a functional approach and examines how the agreement, contract, or transaction is marketed,
managed, and performed, instead of relying solely on language used by the parties in the
agreement, contract, or transaction.â Unless the Commission provides otherwise, the 28 days
for actual delivery is 28 days from the date the agreement, contract, or transaction is confirmed
to the buyer or seller, typically, a retail customer.

 

* As is relevant to this matter, Section 1a(18)(xi) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ La(18)(xi) (2012),
defines an individual eligible contract participant as a person who has amounts invested on a
discretionary basis, the aggregate of which is in excess of $10,000,000, or which is in excess
of $5,000,000 and who enters into the agreement, contract, or transaction in order to manage
the risk associated with an asset owned or liability incurred, or reasonably likely to be owned
or incurred, by the individual.

* The Commission has not adopted any regulations permitting a longer actual delivery period
for any commodity pursuant to Section 2(c)(2)(D)Gi)(1D(aa) of the Act. Accordingly, the 28
day actual delivery period set forth in this provision remains applicable to all commodities.

> See Retail Commodity Transactions Under Commodity Exchange Act, 76 Fed, Reg. 77,670
(Dec. 14, 2011)

 
Other than these exceptions, Congress did not express any intent to limit the reach of
Section 2(c)(2)(D). Rather, in enacting the statute Congress expressed its intent that Section
2(c)(2)(D) should be applicable to a broad range of agreements, contracts, and transactions.

Section 2(c)(2)(D) of the Act applies to all agreements, contracts, and transactions
entered into with, or offered to, non-ECPs on a leveraged or margined basis, or financed by
the offeror, the counterparty, or a person acting in concert with the offeror or counterparty on a
similar basis, as those terms are commonly used in the industry,

B. The Commission's Jurisdiction

Respondents offered precious metals transactions to, and entered into such transactions
with, persons who were not eligible contract participants or eligible commercial entities.
Generally, Respondents' customers were unsophisticated, individual investors who did not
meet the $10 million discretionary investment threshold to be considered ECPs. Moreover,
Respondents offered and entered into such transactions on a margined or leveraged basis, or
financed by Midwest or Hunter Wise, which acted in concert with Respondents. Respondentsâ
retail financed precious metals transactions fall squarely within the Commission's jurisdiction
under Section 2(c)(2)(D) of the Act.

Respondents' retail financed precious metals transactions executed through Hunter
Wise did not result in actual delivery to the customer. As found by the district court and
affirmed by the Eleventh Circuit in Hunter Wise, Hunter Wise had no actual metal to deliver.
Hunter Wise, Case No. 9:12-cy-81311-DMM, slip op. at 12-14, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35770
(S.D. Fla., Feb. 19, 2014) (order granting summary judgment); U.S. CFTC vy. Hunter Wise
Commodities, LLC, 749 F.3d 967, 982 (1 1"" Cir, 2014). Respondents' transactions are not
excepted from the Commission's jurisdiction under Section 2(c)(2)(D)Gi)(HD of the Act.

C, Respondents Violated Section 4(a) of the Act: legal, Off-Exchange Transactions

As stated above, retail commodity transactions within the scope of Section 2(c)(2)(D)
of the Act are subject to enforcement under Section 4(a) of the Act, among other provisions, as
if such transactions are commodity futures contracts. Section 4(a) of the Act makes it unlawful
for any person to offer to enter into, enter into, execute, confirm the execution of, or conduct
an office or business in the United States for the purpose of soliciting, or accepting any order
for, or otherwise dealing in any transaction in, or in connection with, a commodity futures
contract, unless such transaction is made on or subject to the rules of a board of trade that has
been designated or registered by the CFTC as a contract market or derivatives transaction
execution facility for the specific commodity.

Respondents offered to enter into, entered into, and confirmed the execution of retail
financed precious metals transactions. Respondents also conducted an office and business in
the United States for the purpose of soliciting, accepting orders for, and otherwise dealing in
retail financed precious metals transactions. None of the retail financed precious metals
transactions were conducted on or subject to the rules of a board of trade that has been

 
designated or registered by the CFTC as a contract market or derivatives transaction execution
facility for precious metals. Respondents therefore violated Section 4(a) of the Act.

D. Midwest is Liable for the Violations of its Agents

Midwest is liable for the violations of its agents, including Ekasala. Under Section
2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C, Â§ 2(a)(1)(B) (2012), as well as Regulation 1.2, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.2
(2013), a principal is strictly liable for the violations of its agents made within the scope of the
agents' employment. Rosenthal & Co. v. CFTC, 802 F.2d 963, 966 (7th Cir. 1986). Ekasala,
along with other Midwest telemarketers, were agents of Midwest, and in the scope of their
employment they violated Section 4(a) of the Act. Midwest is therefore liable for these
violations.

E. Ekasala Is Liable as the Controlling Person Under Section 13(b) of the Act for
Midwest's Violations

Ekasala is directly liable for violations of Section 4(a) of the Act. In addition, Ekasala
directly controlled Midwest and directly and knowingly induced Midwest's conduct
constituting violations of the Act; therefore, pursuant to Section 13(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.

Â§ 13c(b) (2012), Ekasala is liable for Midwest 's violations of Section 4(a) of the Act. Section
13(b) of the Act states that a controlling person of an entity is liable for the violations of that
entity, provided that the controlling person knowingly induced, directly or indirectly, the
violations, or provided that the controlling person did not act in good faith. ""A fundamental
purpose of Section [13(b)] is to allow the Commission to reach behind the corporate entity to
the controlling individuals of the corporation and to impose liability for violations of the Act
directly on such individuals as well as the corporation itself."" CFTC v. R.J. Fitzgerald & Co.,
Inc., 310 F.3d 1321, 1334 (11th Cir. 2002) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted),
cert, denied, 543 U.S. 1034 (2004).

To establish controlling person liability under Section 13(b), the Division must show
both (1) control; and (2) lack of good faith or knowing inducement of the acts constituting the
violation. Jn re First Natâl Trading Corp., [1992-1994 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep.
(CCH) Â¥ 26,142 at 41,787 (CFTC Jul. 20, 1994), affd without opinion sub nom. Pick v.
CFTC, 99 P.3d 1139 (6th Cir. 1996). To establish the first element, control, a defendant must
possess general control over the operation of the entity principally liable. See, eg, RJ
Fitzgerald, 310 F.3d at 1334 (recognizing an individual who ""exercised the ultimate choice-
making power within the firm regarding its business decisions"" as a controlling person).
Evidence that a defendant is an officer, founder, principal, or the authorized signatory on the
company's bank accounts indicates the power to control a company. In re Spiegel, [1987-1990
Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) 24,103 at 34,767 (CFTC Jan. 12, 1988). The
Division must also show that a defendant possessed specific control, which is ""the power or
ability to control the specific transaction or activity upon which the primary violation was
predicated."" Monieson v CFTC, 996 F.2d 852, 860 (7th Cir. 1993) (internal quotation marks
and citation omitted). The defendant does not need to participate in or benefit from the
wrongdoing; the issue is whether the defendant has the power to address the illegal conduct.

 
/d. (finding that, in a trade allocation case, the fact that the defendant could fire or discipline
responsible employees, end the placement of orders without numbers as soon as the defendant
knew of it, or order a full investigation was sufficient to show specific control).

With respect to control, Ekasala was the owner and operator of Midwest. He managed
the day-to-day operations, hired employees, supervising the solicitation of retail customers and
engaging in solicitations himself. Ekasala was the ultimate decision maker and controlled all
aspects of Midwestâs business. Ekasala had both general control over Midwest and specific
control over the conduct underlying Midwest's violations, i.e., Midwest offering to enter into,
entering into, and confirming the execution of retail financed precious metals transactions, and
Midwest conducting an office and business in the United States for soliciting, accepting, and
otherwise dealing in retail financed precious metals transactions.

In addition to control, the Division must show the controlling person knowingly
induced, directly or indirectly, the acts constituting the violation or did not act in good faith.
To show knowing inducement, the Division must show that a defendant had actual or
constructive knowledge of the core activities that constituted the violation and allowed the
activities to continue. Jn re Spiegel, [1987-1990 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH)
at 34,767. To show lack of good faith, the Division must show that a defendant did not have
an adequate system of internal supervision, or that a defendant did not enforce such system
with reasonable diligence. Monieson, 996 F.2d at 860.

Ekasala had actual knowledge that Midwest's business was in off-exchange, retail
financed precious metals transactions, because it was the basic nature or essence of the firmâs
business activities. He also allowed the business to continue, Thus, Ekasala knowingly
induced the conduct in violation of Section 4(a) of the Act. Moreover, Ekasala also did not act
in good faith, because he failed to have in place an adequate supervisory system to ensure that
the off-exchange leveraged precious metals transactions that Midwest Metals pitched to
customers were fully compliant with the requirements of the CEA. Therefore, in addition to
being directly liable for his personal violations of Section 4(a) of the Act, he is liable as a
controlling person for Midwest Metalsâ violations of Section 4(a).

CFTC Orders Florida-Based Midwest Metals Exchange and Its Owner, Brian S. Ekasala, to
Pay Restitution and a Civil Monetary Penalty Totaling More than $522,000 for Engaging in
Illegal, Off-Exchange Precious Metals Transactions

Washington DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today issued an Order filing and
simultaneously settling charges against Brian S. Ekasala, a resident of Lake Worth, Florida, and his company, Midwest
Metals Exchange, LLC (Midwest) of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, for engaging in illegal, off-exchange precious metals
transactions.

The CFTC Order requires Ekasala and Midwest jointly to pay restitution totaling $322,852.71 and a $200,000 civil
monetary penalty. The Order further imposes permanent trading and registration bans against Ekasala and Midwest and
requires them to cease and desist from violating Section 4(a) of the Commodity Exchange Act.

As explained in the Order, financed transactions in commodities with retail customers, like those engaged in by Ekasala
and Midwest, must be executed on or subject to the rules of an exchange approved by the CFTC. The CFTC Order finds
that, from July 2011 through March 2013, Midwest solicited retail customers to buy and sell precious metals, which were
executed through Hunter Wise Commodities, LLC (Hunter Wise). Midwest telemarketers represented that a customer
could purchase precious metals with just a 30 percent deposit, and that the customer would receive a loan for the
remaining 70 percent, according to the Order. In addition to interest on the âloan,â the customer also had to pay a
commission and a mark-up on the total value of the metal. Neither Midwest nor Hunter Wise bought, sold, loaned, stored,
or transferred any physical metals for these transactions. Neither Midwest nor Hunter Wise actually delivered any
precious metals to any customer. Notwithstanding the fact that no physical metal was involved, Midwest's transactions
were illegal because they were not executed on a registered exchange.

The CFTC sued Midwestâs clearing firm, Hunter Wise, in federal court in Florida on December 5, 2012. The CFTC charged
Hunter Wise with engaging in illegal, off-exchange precious metals transactions, as well as fraud and other violations (see
CFTC Press Release 6447-12). On February 25, 2013, the court granted a preliminary injunction against Hunter Wise,
froze the firmâs assets, and appointed a corporate monitor to assume control over those assets (see CFTC Press Release
6522-13).

The Order states that Ekasala owned and operated Midwest and controlled its day-to-day operations, with exclusive
authority over the hiring and supervision of Midwest telemarketers.

The CFTC cautions victims that restitution orders may not result in the recovery of money lost because the wrongdoers
may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers and to
ensure that the wrongdoers are held accountable.

The CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Michael Amakor, Todd Kelly, Peter M. Haas,
and Paul G. Hayeck.

ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO SECTIONS 6(c) AND 6(d) OF
: THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, MAKING FINDINGS
AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

I.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ) has reason to believe that
during the period between December 2011 and February 2013 (the ârelevant periodâ),
Paramount Metals Exchange, LLC (âParamount Metalsâ) and Paramount Credit, LLC
(âParamount Creditâ) (collectively, âParamountâ), including their controlling persons, Isaiah
Goldman (âGoldmanâ) and Brock Catronio (âCatronioâââ), (collectively âthe Respondentsâ),
violated Sections 4(a), 4b(a)(2)(A) & (C), 4b(a)(2)(B), 4d and 6(c)(1) of the Commodity
Exchange Act (âActâ), 7 U.S.C. 8Â§ 6(a), 6b(a)(2)(A) &(C), 6b(a)(2)(B), 6d and 9(1) (2012) and
Regulation 180.1(a)(1)-(3), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 180.1(a)(2014). Therefore, the Commission deems it
appropriate and in the public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are,
instituted to determine whether the Respondents engaged in the violations set forth herein and to
determine whether any order should be issued imposing remedial sanctions.

Il.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, the Respondents have
submitted an Offer of Settlement (âOfferâ), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Without admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, Respondents consent to
the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 6(c) and 6(d) of the
Commodity Exchange Act, Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (âOrderâ) and
acknowledges service of this Order.â

 

Respondents consent to the entry of this Order and to the use of these findings in this proceeding and in any other
proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party; provided, however, that Respondents
do not consent to the use of the Offer, or the findings or conclusions in this Order consented to in the Offer, as the
sole basis for any other proceeding brought by the Commission, other than in a proceeding in bankruptcy or to

 
HI.
The Commission finds the following: |
A. SUMMARY

During the relevant period, Respondents violated Section 4(a) of the Act by offering to
enter into, entering into, confirming the execution of, and conducting an office and business in
the United States for the purpose of soliciting, accepting orders for, and otherwise dealing in
illegal, off-exchange retail commodity transactions. Specifically, the transactions were financed
precious metals transactions with individual retail investors. The Respondents also violated
Sections 4b(a)(2)(A) and (C) of the Act by defrauding customers by representing to them that
they were purchasing physical metals and that they were making cash purchases when, in fact,
their purchases were leveraged transactions with an undisclosed third-party (Hunter Wise) for
physical metals that the Respondents never purchased or possessed and for which they never had
title. Similarly, the Respondents violated Section 4b(a)(1)(B) of the Act by falsely claiming to
âshipâ or âreceiveâ metals following each trade in âTransfer of Commodityâ notices when, in
fact, no physical metals were being shipped or received. The Respondents violated Section 4d of
the Act by acting as an unregistered futures commission merchant (âFCMâ) by soliciting and
accepting orders for retail commodity transactions and accepting money, securities or property
for trades or contracts without the benefit of registration as an FCM. Finally, the Respondents
violated Section 6(c)(1) of the Act and Regulation 180.1(a)(1)(3) by engaging in the same ~
fraudulent and deceptive acts by which they violated Section 4b(a)(2) of the Act. Respondents
solicited and accepted orders from individual investors who collectively lost the sum of
$1,595,946 in connection with these transactions. Goldman and Catronio are directly liable for
the aforementioned violations, and are also liable as the controlling persons of Paramount.

Cc. OTHER RELEVANT ENTITY

Hunter Wise Commodities LLC (âHunter Wiseâ) was formed as a California limited
liability company in July 2007 but was converted to a Nevada limited liability company in
October 2010. It held itself out on its website as âa physical commodity trading company,
wholesaler, market maker, back-office support provider, and finance company.â During the
relevant period, Hunter Wise executed and confirmed the execution of retail commodity
transactions involving gold, silver, platinum, palladium and copper throughout the United States
using a network of telemarketing solicitors such as Respondents, which it referred to as its
âdealers.â

D. FACTS

Beginning in December 2011, when Paramount was formed, and continuing through at
least February 22, 2013, the Respondents solicited retail customers to enter into off-exchange
trading of gold, silver and platinum and accepted funds from customers in order to enter those
transactions. Goldman and Catronio, the controlling persons of Paramount, directly solicited
customers and supervised the other telemarketers involved in solicitation, Goldman, Catronio,
and the other telemarketers for Paramount told customers that they were making outright cash
purchases of precious metals, while instead treating their transactions as financed purchases of
metal in which the retail customer only paid a portion of the purchase price and took out a loan
for the balance of the price (âRetail Commodity Transactionsâ). The Respondents also falsely
claimed to: (a) sell physical metals to customers; (b) transfer title of physical metals to
customers; and (c) arrange for the transfer and storage of customersâ physical metals in
independent depositories where such metal was purportedly held on the customersâ behalf.
These representations were false because the Respondents did not sell or transfer ownership of
any physical metals and no metals were stored in any depositories for or on behalf of customers.
Rather, the Respondents used a portion of funds received from customers to enter into
transactions with a third party, Hunter Wise. This conduct was not disclosed to its customers,

Respondentsâ customers paid a total of $3,306,032 to Hunter Wise and suffered a total of
$1,595,946 in net trading losses, commission, interest charges and other fees during the relevant
period. Respondents received commissions and fees totaling $853,279 for the retail financed
precious metals transactions executed through Hunter Wise.

 
Neither Respondents nor Hunter Wise bought, sold, loaned, stored, or transferred any
physical metals for these financed precious metals transactions. The transactions were
leveraged, off-exchange trades with retail customers that did not involve the actual delivery of
any metals. Instead, Hunter Wise and Paramount managed exposure on these transactions using
derivatives in margin trading accounts with several entities, CFTC v. Hunter Wise Commodities,
LLC F, Supp. 3d 1311(Â°8.D,Fla, Feb, 19, 2014) (order granting summary judgment).

IV.
LEGAL DISCUSSION
A. Relevant Statutory Background

Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010,
Public Law 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376 (2010) (âthe Dodd-Frank Actâ) amended the Commodity
Exchange Act to add, among other things, new authority over certain leveraged, margined, or
financed retail commodity transactions, including authority to prohibit fraud in connection with
such transactions.

Section 742(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act added Section 2(c)(2)(D) to the Act,â which
broadly applies to any agreement, contract, or transaction in any commodity that is entered into
with, or offered to (even if not entered into with), a non-eligible contract participant (ânon-
ECPâ) or non-eligible commercial entity on a leveraged or margined basis, or financed by the
offeror, the counterparty, or a person acting in concert with the offeror or counterparty on a
similar basis. 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(c)(2)(D)(i). Section 2(c)(2)(D) further provides that such transactions
with retail customers be conducted on a registered commodity exchange and that such an
agreement, contract, or transaction shall be subject to Sections 4(a), 4(b), and 4b âof the Act âas
if the agreement, contract, or transaction was a contract of sale of a commodity for future
delivery.â 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(c)(2)(D) Gin).

Section 2(c)(2)(D)(ii) of the Act excepts certain transactions from Section 2(c)(2)(D).
Section 2(c)(2)(D)(ii)TID(aa) excepts a contract of sale that âresults in actual delivery within 28
days or such other longer period as the Commission may determine by rule or regulation based

 

* Section 2(c)(2)(D) of the Act became effective July 16, 2011.

* As is relevant to this matter, Section La(18)(xi) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ la(18)(xi), defines an eligible contract
participant as an individual who has amounts invested on a discretionary basis, the aggregate of which is in excess
of $10,000,000, or which is in excess of $5,000,000 and who enters into the agreement, contract, or transaction in
order to manage the risk associated with an asset owned or liability incurred, or reasonably likely to be owned or
incurred, by the individual.

* Section 4(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6(b), authorizes the Commission to adopt rules and regulations proscribing
fraud and requiring minimum financial standards, the disclosure of risk, the filing of reports, the keeping of books
and records, the safeguarding of customersâ funds, and registration with the Commission. Section 4b of the Act,
7 U.S.C. Â§ 6b, prohibits fraudulent conduct,

 
upon the typical commercial practice in cash or spot markets for the commodity involved.â
Section 2(c)(2)(D)(ii)(II1)(bb) excepts a contract of sale that creates an enforceable obligation to
deliver between a seller and a buyer that have the ability to deliver and accept delivery,
respectively, in connection with the line of business of the seller and buyer.

The Commission has stated its view that the determination of whether âactual deliveryâ
has occurred within the meaning of Section 2(c)(2)(D)G@i)(I)(aa) requires a consideration of
evidence beyond the four corners of the contract documents. This interpretation of the statutory
language is based on Congressâ use of the word âactualâ to modify âdeliveryâ and on the
legislative history of Section 2(c)(2)(D)(ii)(ID (aa). Consistent with this interpretation, in
determining whether actual delivery has occurred within 28 days, the Commission will employ a
functional approach and examine how the agreement, contract, or transaction is marketed,
managed, and performed, instead of relying solely on language used by the parties in the
agreement, contract, or transaction.Â© Unless the Commission provides otherwise, the 28 days for
actual delivery is 28 days from the date the agreement, contract, or transaction is confirmed to
the buyer or seller, typically, a retail customer.

_ Other than these exceptions, Congress did not express any intent to limit the reach of
Section 2(c)(2)(D). Rather, in enacting the statute Congress expressed its intent that Section
2(c)(2)(D) should be applicable to a broad range of agreements, contracts, and transactions.

Section 2(c)(2)(D) of the Act applies to all agreements, contracts, and transactions
entered into with, or offered to, non-ECPs on a leveraged or margined basis, or financed by the
offeror, the counterparty, or a person acting in concert with the offeror or counterparty on a
similar basis, as those terms are commonly used in the industry,

B. The Commissionâs Jurisdiction

Respondents offered precious metals transactions to, and entered into such transactions
with, persons who were not eligible contract participants or eligible commercial entities.
Generally, Respondentsâ customers were unsophisticated, individual investors who did not meet
the $10 million discretionary investment threshold to be considered ECPs. Moreover,
Respondents offered and entered into such transactions which they represented to customers as
cash deals but actually treated them as margined or leveraged transactions, financed by
Respondents or Hunter Wise, which acted in concert with Respondents, Respondentsâ retail
financed precious metals transactions fall squarely within the Commissionâs jurisdiction under
Section 2(c)(2)(D) of the Act.â

 

> The Commission has not adopted any regulations permitting a longer actual delivery period for any commodity
pursuant to Section 2(c)(2)(D)Gi)(IID(aa) of the Act. Accordingly, the 28 day actual delivery period set forth in this
provision remains applicable to all commodities.

Â° See Retail Commodity Transactions Under Commodity Exchange Act, 76 Fed. Reg. 77,670 (Dec. 14, 2011).

â Confirmation of the Commissionâs jurisdiction over these matters can be found in the February 25, 2013 decision
of a district court in the Southern District of Florida, which entered a preliminary injunction against Hunter Wise
Commodities, LLC, and a number of related companies and individuals for engaging in similar transactions after
finding that Section 2(c)(2)(D) and 6(c) of the Act expanded the Commissionâs jurisdiction to cover such retail
commodity transactions. See Order on Pl.âs Mot, Prelim. Inj., CFTC v. Hunter Wise Commodities, LLC, 2013 WL

 
Respondentsâ retail financed precious metals transactions executed through Hunter Wise
did not result in actual delivery to the customer. As found by the district court in Hunter Wise,
Hunter Wise had no actual metal to deliver. Hunter Wise, No, 12-81311-CIV, Docket Entry 78,
slip op. at 19-20 & n.30 (order granting preliminary injunction) and Docket Entry 155, slip op. at
15-17 (S.D, Fla. Jun. 21, 2013) (order denying motions to dismiss), Respondentâs transactions
are not excepted from the Commissionâs jurisdiction under Section 2(c)(2)(D)(1i)(II1)(A) of the
Act.

C, Respondents Violated Section 4(a) of the Act: [legal, Off-Exchange Transactions

As stated above, retail commodity transactions within the scope of Section 2(c)(2)(D) of
the Act are subject to enforcement under Section 4(a) of the Act, among other provisions, as if
such transactions are commodity futures contracts. Section 4(a) of the Act makes it unlawful for
any person to offer to enter into, enter into, execute, confirm the execution of, or conduct an
office or business in the United States for the purpose of soliciting, or accepting any order for, or
otherwise dealing in any transaction in, or in connection with, a commodity futures contract,
unless such transaction is made on or subject to the rules of a board of trade that has been
designated or registered by the CFTC as a contract market or derivatives transaction execution
facility for the specific commodity, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6(a).

Respondents offered to enter into, entered into, and confirmed the execution of retail
financed precious metals transactions. Respondents also conducted a business in the United
States for the purpose of soliciting, accepting orders for, and otherwise dealing in retail financed
precious metals transactions, None of the retail financed precious metals transactions were
conducted on or subject to the rules of a board of trade that has been designated or registered by
the CFTC as a contract market or derivatives transaction execution facility for precious metals.
Respondents therefore violated Section 4(a) of the Act.

D. Respondents Violated Section 4b(a)(2)(A) and (C)

Sections 4b(a)(2)(A) and (C) make it a violation for any person, in or in connection with
any order to make, or the making of, any contract of sale of any commodity for future delivery
that is made, or to be made, for, on behalf of, or with any other person, other than on or subject
to the rules of a designated contract market: (A) to cheat or defraud or attempt to cheat or
defraud the other person; or (C) willfully to deceive or attempt to deceive the other person by
any means whatsoever in regard to any order or contract or the disposition or execution of any
order or contract, or in regard to any act of agency performed, with respect to any order or
contract for, on behalf of, or with the other person. Three elements must be proven to establish a
violation through misrepresentations: (1) that the respondent misrepresented or failed to disclose

 

718503 (S.D.Fla. Feb, 26, 2013), This decision was affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh
Circuit on April 15, 2014. CFTC v, Hunter Wise Commodities, LLC, et al., 749 F, 3d 967, 2014 WL 1424435 (1 yh
Cir, 2014). Additionally, the District Court in the Hunter Wise matter entered an Opinion and Order of Final
Judgment, Permanent Injunction, Civil Monetary Penalty, and Other Equitable Relief finding the defendants in that
matter liable for violations of Sections 4(a), 4(b)(a)(2)(A)-(C), 4d, and 13c(a) of the Act, banning defendants from
engaging in such conduct, and ordering defendants to pay full restitution, and triple the monetary gain as a penalty.
CFIC y, Hunter Wise Commodities, LLC, 2014 WL 4049998 (S.D. Fla. May 16, 2014).

 
certain information; (2) the misrepresentation was material; and (3) the respondent acted with
scienter. The Respondents conduct satisfies all three elements.

The Respondents willfully or recklessly misrepresented and omitted information
regarding the products that were being sold to their retail customers. Specifically, they
misrepresented that they: (1) purchased, sold and transferred ownership of physical metals to
customers; (2) sold physical metals to customers on a cash and non-leveraged basis while, at the
same time, treating the transactions as leveraged and charging customersâ interest on sham loans;
and (3) stored customersâ financed physical metals in independent depositories. The
misrepresentations made by the Respondents to their customers were material in that reasonable
customers would want to know: (1) that they were not purchasing actual, physical metals, but,
rather, paper assets; (2) the full extent of charges that they would incur and that they had taken
out a loan and; (3) that a third party unknown to them, Hunter Wise, controlled all aspects of
their transactions, including the storage of the metals. The Respondents also acted with scienter
in making these misrepresentations. First, they knew that they were engaging in leveraged
transactions with customers while representing to customers that they were selling the customers
physical metals. Second, they failed to inquire whether Hunter Wise maintained a physical
inventory of metals for their customers while sending single, small shipments of physical metal,
purchased from another source to customers to convince them that the inventory of the full
quantity of metals in their accounts existed. Third, they consciously withheld the Client
Statements and Trade Confirmations from their customers for those would have revealed that
they had taken out loans rather than having made a cash deal. The Respondents therefore
violated Sections 4b(a)(2)(A) & (C).

E. Respondents Violated Section 4b(a)(2)(B)

Section 4b(a)(2)(B) makes it a violation of the Act for any person to make or cause to be
made to another person any false report or statement, or willfully to enter or cause to be entered
for the other person any false record. The Respondents falsely claimed to âshipâ or âreceiveâ
metals following each trade in âTransfer of Commodityâ notices. By this conduct, the
Respondents violated section 4b(a)(2) of the Act. See, e.g, CFTC v. Noble Wealth Data Info.
Serv., Inc., 90 F. Supp. 2d at 685-87 (D. Md. 2000), aff'd in relevant part sub nom, CFTC v.
Baragosh â, 278 F.3d 319 (4th Cir, 2002) (finding that defendants issued false account statements
and engaged in other misconduct under Section 4b(a)(2)(i)-(iii), the predecessor to Section
Ab(a)(1)(A)-(C) of the Act, as amended); CFTC v. McLaurin, No. 95-C-285, 1996 U.S, Dist.
LEXIS 9417, at *10-12 (N.D. Il. July 3, 1996) (finding that defendant prepared and distributed
false reports or statements in violation of Section 4b(a)(2)(ii) of the Act).

F, Respondents Violated Section 6(c)(1) of the Act and Regulation 180.1(a)(1)-( 3)

The Respondents made untrue or misleading statements of material facts on and after
August 15, 2011 and engaged in the same fraudulent and deceptive acts by which they violated
Section 4b(a)(2) of the Act. Thus, they violated Section 6(c)(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 9(1)
(2012), and Regulation 180.1(a)(1)-(3), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 180.1(a)(1)-(3) (2014). See 76 F.R. 41398,
July 14, 2011, effective Aug. 15, 2011.

 
Section 6(c)(1) of the Act, in relevant part, makes it unlawful for any person to use or
employ, or attempt to use or employ, in connection with any contract of sale of any commodity
in interstate commerce or for future delivery, any manipulative or deceptive device or
contrivance in contravention of the Commissionâs Rules and Regulations. Regulation 180.1{a),
in relevant part, makes it unlawful for any person:

in connection with any... contract of sale of any commodity in
interstate commerce .. . to intentionally or recklessly: (1) Use or
employ, or attempt to use or employ, any manipulative device,
scheme, or artifice to defraud; (2) Make, or attempt to make, any
untrue or misleading statement of a material fact or to omit to state
a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made not
untrue or misleading; (3) Engage, or attempt to engage, in any act,
practice, or course of business, which operates or would operate as
a fraud or deceit upon any person....

G. Respondents Violated Section 4d

Section 4d makes it unlawful for any person to be an FCM unless such person is
registered with the Commission, The Act defines FCM to include an entity that is engaged in
soliciting or accepting orders for, among other things, the purchase or sale of a commodity for
future delivery, any commodity option authorized under Section 4c, or any retail commodity
transaction, 7 U.S.C, Â§ 1a(28)(A)(i)(D(aa)(DD).

Paramount accepted orders for customers in retail financed precious metals transactions
thereby acting as an FCM and, therefore, was required to be registered. Paramount was never
registered with the Commission and, therefore, violated Section 4d of the Act in connection with
its retail metals transactions.

H. Paramount is Liable for the Violations of its Agents

Paramount is liable for the violations of its agents, including Goldman and Catronio.
Under Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2a(1)(B)(2012), as well as Regulation 1.2,
17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.2 (2013), a principal is strictly liable for the violations of its agents made within
the scope of the agentsâ employment under âa variant of the common law principle of respondeat
superior.â Rosenthal & Co. v. CFTC, 802 F.2d 963, 966 (7th Cir, 1986). Because Goldman,
Catronio and other Paramount personnel who solicited the customers were all agents of
Paramount acting within the scope of their employment, Paramount is liable for their conduct
under Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act.

I, Goldman and Catronio are Liable as Controlling Persons Under Section 13(b) of the
Act for Paramountâs Violations

Pursuant to Section 13(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 13c(b), âany person who, directly or
indirectly, controls any person who has violated any provision of this chapter or any of the rules,
regulations, or orders issued pursuant to this chapter may be held liable for such violation in any
action brought by the Commission to the same extent as such controlled person. In such action,

 
the Commission has the burden of proving that the controlling person did not act in good faith or
knowingly induced, directly or indirectly, the act or acts constituting the violation.â To satisfy
this standard of proof, the Commission must establish that (1) a corporation or person violated
the Act; (2) the defendant âdirectly or indirectlyâ controlled that corporation or person; and

(3) that the controlling person or corporation âdid not act in good faith or knowingly induced,
directly or indirectly, the act or acts constituting the violation.â See Dietrich v. Bauer, 126 F.
Supp. 2d 759 (S.D, N.Y. 2001). Accord, Monieson v. CFTC, 996 F.2d 852, 858 (7th Cir, 1993);
CFTC v. RJ Fitzgerald & Co., Inc., 310 F.3d 1321, 1334 (1 ith Cir. 2002), cert. denied, 543 US.
1034 (2004). In essence, the CFTC must show that the controlling person had actual or
constructive knowledge of the core activities that make up the violation at issue and allowed
them to continue. RJ. Fitzgerald & Co., Inc., 310 F.3d at 1334.

Goldman and Catronio are liable as controlling persons for the actions of Paramount.
First, both Goldman and Catronio controlled Paramount in that they each executed contracts on
behalf of Paramount, controlled its bank accounts, directly solicited customers and supervised
the other telemarketers involved in solicitation, and were responsible for its business decisions.
In addition, Catronio was responsible for Paramountâs website. Further, Goldman and Catronio
knowingly induced Paramountâs wrongful conduct by personally misrepresenting the nature of
the leveraged metals they sold to customers; they supervised the other telemarketers involved in
solicitation; and the website under Catronioâs control also contained misrepresentations. Further,
Catronio and Goldman also did not act in good faith because they supervised employees who
fraudulently solicited Paramountâs customers and recklessly allowed those employees to
misrepresent the nature of the leveraged transactions they sold to customers.

V.
FINDINGS OF VIOLATIONS â

Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that, during the relevant period,
Paramount Metals, Paramount Credit, Goldman and Catronio violated Sections 4(a), 4b(a)(2)(A)
and (C), 4b(a)(2)(B), 4d and 6(c)(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C Â§Â§ 6(a), 6b(a)(2)(A) and (C),
6b(a)(2)(B), 6d, and 9(1) and Regulation 180.1(a), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 180.1(a).

CFTC Orders Florida Residents Isaiah Goldman and Brock Catronio and their Companies,
Paramount Metals Exchange, LLC and Paramount Credit, LLC, to Pay More than $2.5
Million in Sanctions for Engaging in Illegal, Off-Exchange Precious Metals Transactions

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today issued an Order filing and
simultaneously settling charges against Isaiah Goldman and Brock Catronio, individually, and their companies,
Paramount Metals Exchange, LLC and Paramount Credit, LLC (collectively Paramount), both of Delray Beach,
Florida, for engaging in illegal, off-exchange precious metals transactions. Goldman resides in Boca Raton, Florida, and
Catronio resides in Delray Beach.

The CFTC Order requires Goldman, Catronio, and Paramount jointly to pay restitution of $1,595,946 to their customers
and jointly to pay a $1 million civil monetary penalty. In addition, the Order imposes permanent registration and trading
bans on Goldman, Catronio, and Paramount.

The Order finds that, from December 2011 through February 2013, Goldman, Catronio, and Paramount solicited retail
customers to engage in outright cash purchases of precious metals, falsely claiming to sell and transfer title of physical
metals to customers and to arrange for the transfer and storage of the physical metals in independent depositories
where such metal was purportedly held on the customersâ behalf.

The Order states that unknown to Paramount customers, Goldman, Catronio, and Paramount instead treated the
customersâ transactions as financed purchases of metal in which the retail customer only paid a portion of the purchase
price and took out a loan for the balance of the purchase price. According to the Order, Paramountâs customers paid a
total of $3,306,032 and lost $1,595,946 of their funds to trading losses, commissions, interest charges, and other fees to
Paramount and another company. Goldman, Catronio, and Paramount received $853,279 of those commissions and fees.
Thus, the Order finds that, among other specific findings, Goldman, Catronio, and Paramount engaged in illegal, off-
exchange transactions and committed fraud, violating provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act.

Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, financed transactions such as those
conducted by Paramount, are illegal off-exchange transactions unless they result in actual delivery of metal within 28
days. According to the Order, Paramountâs retail financed precious metals transactions executed through Hunter Wise
Commodities LLC did not result in actual delivery to the customer. In addition, as explained in the CFTC Order, financed
transactions such as these must be executed on or subject to the rules of an exchange approved by the CFTC, which
Paramount did not do.

The CFTC cautions that restitution orders may not result in the recovery of money lost because the wrongdoers may not
have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers and to ensure
the wrongdoers are held accountable.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this action are Susan B. Padove, Heather Johnson, Elizabeth
M. Streit, Scott Williamson, and Rosemary Hollinger.

Kevin G. White Sentenced to over Eight Years in Federal Prison for $7.4 Million Commodity
Pool Investment Scam

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced that Kevin G. White of
The Woodlands, Texas, who orchestrated a $7.4 million commodity pool investment scam during which he
misappropriated approximately $1.7 million from pool participants, was sentenced to over eight years in federal prison
for charges related to his fraudulent misconduct. Earlier, on December 11, 2013, White pleaded guilty to committing mail
fraud for his actions in connection with the scam.

The criminal charges arose from Whiteâs solicitation fraud and misappropriation of pool participant funds, as charged ina
Complaint filed by the CFTC on July 9, 2013 (see CFTC Press Release 6644-13, July 12, 2013), and a companion Complaint
filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. According to the CFTCâs Complaint, White, along two other Defendants
in the CFTCâs action, RFF GP, LLC, and KGW Capital Management, LLC, duped pool participants into investing in
Revelation Forex Fund, LP, a purported hedge fund and commodity pool. The CFTCâs Complaint further alleged that in
making their solicitations through two websites and at a tradeshow presentation, White fabricated Revelationâs
performance and lied about his investment experience. A proposed consent Order between the CFTC and White, RFF GP,
and KGW Capital is currently pending in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas.

Aitan Goelman, the CFTCâs Director of Enforcement, stated: âThe sentence in this case should serve as a warning that
those who willfully commit fraud in our markets face the very real possibility of a significant term of imprisonment. The
CFTC will continue its vigilance in protecting commodities and derivatives investors from fraud and other forms of
financial crime.â

The CFTC congratulates the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Eastern District of Texas for its successful prosecution of this
matter.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for the related CFTC case are Harry E. Wedewer, Dmitriy
Vilenskiy, John Einstman, and Paul G. Hayeck.

i.
FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

The Court, being fully advised in the premises, finds that there is good cause for the
entry of this Order and that there is no just reason for delay. The Court therefore directs the
entry of findings of fact, conclusions of law and a permanent injunction and ancillary
equitable relief pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2006), as set forth
herein.

FINDINGS OF FACT

 

A. Formation of NHM and North Hills Fund
1, In or around 1995, Bloom formed the North Hills Fund (âthe Fundâ) and
created NHM, as the general partner of the Fund, Bloom is the sole principal and owner of

NHM. The Fund initially was purportedly designed to be an enhanced stock index fund and
Case 19-cv-O01751-JGK Document 79 Filed 06/11/2010. Page Â§ of 26

traded, among other instruments, commodity futures contracts and options. In 2001, Bloom
converted the Fund to an âabsolute return fundâ that would invest in other funds, i-e., a
| âfund of funds.â

2. Defendants represented orally and in writing to existing and prospective
Fund participants that Defendants would invest Fund assets in a number of other funds and,
through diversification and lack of correlation, achieve a âmarket-neutralâ return of
approximately 12%.

3, Defendants provided existing and prospective Fund participants with a
Private Placement Memorandum (âPPMâ) dated August 7, 2001, which attached a copy of
the North Hills Limited Partnership Agreement (the âLPAâ), subscription materials, and a
Partnership Agreement Supplement. The LPA identified the objects and purposes of the
Fund as investing and trading, on margin or otherwise in all forms of financial investments,
including in commodities and commodity contracts.

4, âThe PPM represented that â[t]he Fundâs multi-manager, multi-strategy
approach has been designed to achieve above-average capital appreciation consistent with
moderate risk.â The PPM emphasized that â[t]hrough a program of diversified asset
management, the Fund will be able to take advantage of investment opportunities with a
significant potential reward, while reducing the risk of a substantial decline in the value of

Partnership assets.â Similarly, the PPM stated that a principal advantage of the Fund is its

 

âpolicy of seeking satisfactory returns while minimizing total risk.â
5. According to the PPM and LPA, Fund participants were to receive monthly
reports and annual financial statements audited by an independent certified public

accountant.
Case 1:09-ev-07751-UGK Document 79 Filed Q6/71/2010 Page 7 of 26

6. The PPM also provides for management and incentive fees for NHM based
upon the profitability of the Fund.

7. The PPM also represented that NHM uses a management team comprised of
consultants of Access International Advisors, EIM, USA and members of the Board of
Directors that was to be responsible for the selection of money managers. It is unknown
whether such a management team ever existed or was used by Defendants.

8. Defendants instructed prospective Fund participants to execute a copy of the
solicitation materials and send a check payable to North Hills LP. The minimum initial
capital contribution allowed is $250,000,

9, Based on Detendantsâ representations, the Fund had at least 30-40
participants and should have had assets of at least $30-40 million at one time.

10. Fund participants relied upon Defendantsâ representations, the PPM, LPA
and other solicitation materials and information concerning the Fund trading strategy in
deciding whether to invest, remain invested or make additional investments with Defendants
and the Fund.

1]. Fund participants included the Alexander Dawson Foundation (âADFâ) and
Alexander Dawson Inc. (âADIâ). ADF is a Nevada Charitable Trust that supports schools
and over 1,000 students in Nevada and Colorado. ADI is an investment arm of ADF.

ADIâs and ADPâs investment goals were to achicve modcrate returns with limited risk.

 

Inasmuch as Defendantsâ representations concerning the investment strategy for the Fund
was consistent with their goals for their charitable endeavors, ADI and ADF decided to
maintain their prior investments in the Fund and over time increased in their investments.

ADF and ADI collectively invested $13.5 million with Bloom and NHM through the Fund.
Case 1:09-cv-O1781-JGR Document ?â9 â Filed G6/11/2010 Page 8 of 26

12. Fund participants received monthly account statements that consistently
showed positive returns. Fund participants relied on these statements and made additional
investments in the Fund.

13. Although required by the LPA to provide annual financial statements to
participants in the Fund, Defendants did not.

B. Bloom and NHMMisappropriate at Least $13 Million of Fund Assets

14. During the relevant period, Defendants misappropriated at least $13 million
of the assets of the Fund for the personal use of Bloom and his wife, Relief Defendant
Lauren Bloom. Defendants took the assets of the Fund by executing purporied promissory
notes with the Fund bearing an interest rate of the higher of 8% or the rate of return earned
on all other Partnership assets, net of expenses.

18. A purported independently certified annual financial statement for the Fund
for the year ending December 31, 2002, lists notes receivable in the amount of $2.75 million
as assets of the Fund. The notes to the financial statement set forth two notes as receivables
from NHM to the Fund and state that â[t]he notes receivable were issued as capital
contributions by [NHM].â At least some of the Fundâs participants never received this
financial statement until around or after November 2008.

16. A purported independently certified financial statement for the Fund for the

year ending December 31, 2003, lists additional notes receivable in the amount of $5.255

 

 

million as assets of the Fund as well as the 2002 notes for a total of approximately $8
million. The notes to the financial statement sets forth the notes as receivables from NHM
to the Fund and states that â[t]he notes receivable were issued as capital contributions by

[NHM]â and were charged against managementâs capital, At least some, ifnot all, of the

 
Case t0-cv-O01751-JGK Document 79 Filed 06/11/2010 Page 9 of 26

Fundâs participants never received this financial statement until around or after November,
2068.

17. A Consolidated and Restated Demand Note (âthe Consolidated Noteâ) in the
amount of $13,230,000.00 and dated December 31, 2004, was executed by Bloom on behalf
of NHM through which NHM âborrowedâ the assets of the Fund with promise to repay at
the interest rate of the greater of 8% or the rate of return earned on all other partnership
assets, net of expenses. The Consolidated Note was payable on demand. However, the
Fundâs general partner was NHM and NHM executed the Note on behalf of the Fund and
itself. Upon information and belief, NHM on behalf of the Fund never demanded payment
on the Consolidated Note from itself or Bloom.

18. By the same date of December 31, 2004, Bloom executed a Guaranty
Agreement to and in favor of the Fund in his name and his wifeâs name through which he
personally guaranteed payment and performance on the Consolidated Note. The Guaranty
Agreement provides that the funds borrowed may in whole or in part be provided to or for
the benefit of the Guarantors, the Blooms, and provides that each Guarantor will benefit or
has materially benefited from the proceeds of the Note.

19. Until recently, Defendants did not disclose to any Fund participant that they
were taking assets of the Fund to benefit personally Bloom and his wife.

20. By letter dated November 7, 2008, Defendantsâ counsel disclosed to certain

 

 

Fund participants that âother than assets allocated to {the Philadelphia Alternative Asset
Fund (âPAAFââ)] the remaining assets are in the form of notes payable from NHM which is
presently unable to repay the debt.â Counsel stated it was in excess of $8 million.

21. Throughout the relevant period, as the Blooms were taking more than $13
ase 1:09-cv-01751-JGK Document 79 Filed 06/11/2010 | Page 10 of 26

million of Fund assets, the Blooms maintained a lavish lifestyle. For example, in or around
March 3, 2003, the Blooms purchased a luxury apartment at 10 Gracie Square on the Upper
East Side of Manhattan for $5.2 million. Two years later, on around June or July 2005,
Bloom transferred his ownership to his wife who sold it in 2007 for $11.2 million.

22. During the relevant period, Bloom and his wife maintained multiple
apartments in Upper Manhattan, owned a condominium in Boynton Beach, Florida,
maintained a boat, and leased several Juxury cars. |

23. The Fundâs participants would not have invested or maintained investments
with Defendants and the Fund if they had known that Defendants had engaged in self-
dealing and taken at least $13 million of Fund assets. However, because they did not know
and instead were receiving monthly statement showing profitable returns, the Fundâs
participants made additional investments in the Fund throughout the relevant period.

Cc. Bloom and NHM Invested Contrary to

Represented Investment Strategy and Failed
to Disclose Conflict of Interest with PAAF Investment

24, Commencing in or around January 2004, Bloom entered into a Client
Referral and Fee Sharing Agreement Fee Sharing Agreement with the Philadelphia
Alternative Asset Management Company (âPAAMâ), a registered Commodity Pool
Operator (âCPOâ) managing multiple commodity futures and options pools, including

PAA.

 

25. Pursuant to that agreement, PAAM paid Bloom fees for directly or indirectly
referring investors to the funds managed by PAAM. Bloom received approximately $1.6
million for referring investors to PAAM.

26. Commencing in February 2004 and thereafter, Defendants invested assets of

10
Case 1:09-cv-01751-UGK Document.79 Filed 06/11/2010 Page ti of 26

the Fund in PAAF, and Bloom collected referral fees based on the Fundâs investment in
PAAF of approximately $356,000.

27. Eventually, Defendants had approximately $18 million of the Fundâs assets
in PAAF, which comprised approximately more than half of the assets of the Fund. This
concentration in one fund was contrary to the multi-asset, multi-manager, diversified
strategy represented in the PPM and LPA.

28. In addition, PAAF traded exclusively commodity futures and options, which
Defendants knew or should have known, are highly risky. Defendantsâ investment in PAAF
was contrary to the diversification with reduction of risk approach that Defendants
represented in the PPM to be the investment strategy of the Fund. It was also contrary to the
reason why the Fundâs participants invested with Defendants and the Fund.

29. Fund participants did not learn of the concentrated and risky investment in

PAAF until July 2005 when Defendants informed them that the CFTC had filed a massive
fraud action against PAAM and Paul Eustace (âEustaceâ) anc seized the assets under their
control, including the assets of PAAF. See CFTC v. Philadelphia Alternative Asset
Management Co, and Eustace, Civ. Action 05-2973 (E.D. Pa.).

30. Fund participants were shocked to learn of the concentrated investment in
PAAF and did not view it as consistent with the investment strategy of the Fund represented

in the PPM and LPA.

 

31, Like his failure to disclose that he had âloanedâ his wife and himself $13
million of Fund assets through promissory notes issued by NHM, Bloom never disclosed ta
the Fundâs participants that he was a third-party marketer for PAAM and earning fees.

Bloom did not disclose it even after he disclosed the concentrated investment in PAAF.

 

Il
Case 1:09-cv-01757-JGK Document 79 Filed 06/11/2010. Page 12 of 26

32. Instead of disclosing that Defendants had taken $13 million of Fund assets,
that morc than half of the assets were concentrated in one highly risky commodity futures
and options fund and that Bloom was collecting commissions from the Fundâs investment in
PAAF, Defendants continued to issue false statements that misrepresented the nature and
status of the Fund. For instance, in April 2004, Defendants issued to certain Fund
participants an âExecutive Summaryâ for the Fund which reiterated the balanced fund with
a mmulti-strategy diversified risk approach. The Executive Summary provided investment .
allocation information, set forth the purported annual rates of return for each purported
manager used, and represented that the Fundâs average annual rate of return from July 2001
through December 2003 was 11.27%.

33, In addition, Defendants were meeting with the Fundâs participants and orally
making similar material misrepresentations and omissions.

34. To reassure certain Fund participants concerning the Defendantsâ
compliance and diligence, Defendants retained a purported third-party sub-advisor who also
met with participants. Through the sub-advisor, Defendants issued performance reports in
June 2004, June 2005 and June 2006. None of the reports disclosed the $13 million of
assets taken by NHM for Bloomâs and his wifeâs use. The June 2005 report purports to list
the hedge funds in which the Fund was invested. The June 2005 report did not list the

approximately $18 million in PAAF and instcad listed the allocations as follows: Airlie

 

10%, Centrix 5%, Gramercy 25%, Millennium 25%, Stewardship 25%.

D. In 2006, Bloom Testified that a Fund Manager Should
Disclose Conflicts and that He Would Never Invest Ina

12
Case 1:09-cv-O1751-HoK Document 79 ried 06/17/2010 Page i3of 26 .

Fund Where a Manager Loans Himself Fund Assets
35. Bloom knew that borrowing funds and collecting third-party fees were
conflicts of interest and material facts reasonable mvestors would have wanted to know. In
fact, in sworn testimony in the CFTCâs action against PAAM and Eustace in 2006, Bloom
vehemently declared that defendant Eustace should have disclosed similar types of âloansâ
he made to himself out of PAAF assets and that Bloom never would have invested with
Eustace if he had known Eustace was borrowing PAAF assets.

E. Bloom and NHM Misrepresented the
Status of the Fundâs Interests in PAAF

36. In the CFTCâs action against PAAM and Eustace, the court immediately
appointed a receiver to marshal and distribute assets belonging to the various funds operated
by PAAM and/or Eustace, including PAAF. The various funds defrauded by PAAM and
Eustace had assets invested totaling approximately $250 million, with PAAF having
approximately $28 million, The Fund's assets comprised more than half of PAAFâs assets.

37, As of the end of December 2008, the receiver in the CFTCâs action against
PAAM had distributed approximately $161 million across all the funds. Approximately $19
million of the $161 million was apportioned to PAAF and another fund into which Eustace
had moved PAAF assets. The Fundâs percentage interest in the approximate $19 million

was approximately 54%.

 

 

oF te REC I VET ASSET total cistributions in the name of the Fund of
approximately $9.6 million. Four distributions were made in the name of the Fund: 1) on
December 26, 2006, approximately $1.8 million; 2) on December 15, 2008, approximately
$4.2 million; 3) on March 5, 2008, approximately $1.6 million; and 4) on December 28,

2009, approximately $ 1.7 million.

13
fase 1:09-cv-01751-JGK Document 79S Filed 06/11/2010 Page 14 of 26 |

39. Onor around September 27, 2006, unbeknownst to the Fundâs participants,
Bloom, on behalf of the Fund executed a Participation Agreement with Stonehill
Institutional Partners, L.P. (âStonehillâ). Pursuant to this agreement, Bloom compromised
any return the Fund would receive from the receivership estate in the PAAM case. The
Participation Agreement granted Stonehill a participation interest in the Fundâs interest in
PAAF and any amounts payable to the Fund from PAAF and the Receiver. As evidenced
by executed instructions to the Receiver, all distributions in the name of the Fund were to be
made to Stonehill with correspondence and other information continuing to be sent to
Defendants.

40. Pursuant to the Participation Agreement, Bloom received from Stonehill in
the name of the Fund upfront payments of approximately $2.3 million. Thereafter, Stonehill
retained 20% of any PAAF distributions to the Fund and forwarded the remaining 80% to
Bloom in the name of the Fund. Asa result, Bloom received in the name of the Fund
approximately $8 million from Stonehill,

41. Defendants did not disclose to the Fundâs participants that Bloom had
entered into the Participation Agreement with Stonehill. To the contrary, Bloom routinely
sent written updates on the status of the CFTCâs action, the receivership estate and the
likelihood of recovering assets without ever mentioning the Stonehill agreement, that the

receiver had made distributions and that Bloom had received payments relating to the PAAF

 

 

distributions. Defendants also continued to send out monthly statements to Fund
participants that did not credit or otherwise account for such distributions.
42. The Fundâs participants expected any distributions made by the Receiver in

the name of the Fund to then be distributed appropriately to them by Defendants.

14
Case 1:09-ev-01751-JGK  BDocurent.79 Filed G6/11/2010 Page 15 of 26

43. After the filing of the CFTC action against PAAM and Eustace, the Fundâs
participants began requesting full redemptions from the Fund. These requested redemptions
have not.occurred. Some Fund participants received partial redemptions; others have
received nothing. The Fundâs participants are out millions of dollars due to Defendantsâ
fraud. Defendants used delaying tactics, lies, cbfuscations and excuses, ranging from poor
liquidity to blaming the Madoff debacle, to avoid meeting those demands.

44, For example, in August 2005, after learning of the PAAM fraud, two related
Fund participants who collectively had invested approximately $13.5 million immediately
questioned Defendants and asked about redemptions. Bloom promised that they would not
jose anything as a result of the PAAF demise and made a partial redemption payment of $4
million in the fall of 2005. On November 30, 2007, they requested redemption of another
$3.5 million. Bloom tried to delay responding to that request with excuses of a plan to
increase performance with a new manager. In January 2008, the two Fund participants
requested full redemption of their entire $13.8 million, or at least the $4.8 million of their
funds that was not purportedly in the PAAF investment. In March 2008, Defendants
redeemed only $1 million to them.

45. Throughout, Defendants continued to send monthly statements showing
positive balances. For instance, the two Fund participants discussed in paragraph 44, above,

reccived September 30, 2008 account statements showing collectively that they had over

 

 

$12 million in capital with approximately $7.7 million allocated to PAAF and showing a
gain of approximately $5,000 on the remaining $4.7 million. In October 2008, the two Fund
participants demanded documentation and an accounting of their investments and the assets

of the Fund, Eventually, they learned through Bloomâs counsel that he had taken assets of

1S
fase 1:09-cv-01751-JGK Document79S Filed 06/11/2010 Page 16 of 26.

Fund as âloansâ to himself.

46. Since the filing of the CFTCâs action against PAAM and Eustace, Bloom
personally appeared in federal court in that action representing the Fund anc other funds he
managed and claiming to be a victim of fraud.

47. Defendants knowingly or with reckless disregard for the truth committed the .
foregoing acts of fraud, misappropriation, false statements and reports, and material
misrepresentations and omissions of fact.

48. | Defendants continued to solicit new funds from new prospective participants
and tried to delay meeting demands from Fund participants. Indeed, by letter dated
February 11, 2009 and on Fund letterhead, Bloom represented âI am in the process of
securing funds which should allow me to return the full amount of your investment balance.
My hope is that it can be all worked out in the next month. | ask for your patience, as my
success in that endeavor offers you the greatest chance for the best possible return of your
investment.â

violation of Section 4c(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6c(b) (2006), and Regulation 33.10, 17
C.F.R. Â§ 33.10 (2009).

52, By the conduct identified above, NHM and Bloom, while acting as a CPO
and Associated Person (âAPâ) of a CPO, respectively, employed a device, scheme or artifice
to defraud pool participants and prospective pool participants or engaged in a transaction,
practice or course of business that operated as a fraud or deceit upon pool participants and
prospective pool participants by misappropriating assets of the Fund for Defendantsâ
personal benefit, failing to disclose that Defendants had taken the assets of the Fund, failing
to disclose that Defendants had concentrated more than half of the Fundâs assets in PAAF,
investing Fund assets contrary to the investment strategy represented in the PPM, failing to
disclase that Bloom was receiving commissions from PAAM based on the Fundâs
investment in PAAF, misrepresenting the likelihood of recovery from PAAF and failing to
disclose that Defendants had entered into an agreement that compromised the amount of
funds to be received from PAAF, misrepresenting the status of distributions to be made by
the Receiver and failing to disclose that Defendants had received funds related to PAAF and
issuing false statements concerning the nature and status of the Fundâs participantsâ
interests, all in violation of Section 40(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 60(1) (2006).

53. Each act of fraudulent misappropriation, fraudulent omission and false

statement or report, including but not liniited to those specifically alleged herein, is a

 

separate and distinct violation of Sections 4b(a)(2)(i)-(iti), 4c(b) and 40(1) of the Act,
Sections 4b(a)(1)(A)-(C) of the Act as amended by the CRA, and Regulation 33.10.

CPO, in violation of Section 4m(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6m(1) (2006).

58. Bloom was associated with NHM in a capacity that involved the solicitation
of funds for participation in the Fund but failed to register with the Commission as an AP of
NHM, in violation of Section 4k(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6k(2) (2006).

56. In addition to his direct liability, Bloom, directly or indirectly, controlled
NHM and did not act in good faith or knowingly induced, directly or indirectly, the acts
constituting NHMâs violations of the Act and Regulations . Therefore, pursuant to Section
13(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13Â¢e(b) (2006), Bloom is liable as a controlling person of NHM
for NHMâs violations of Sections 4b(a)(2)(i)-(iii), 4c(b) and 40(1) of the Act, Sections

57. Bloom was acting as an agent of NHM when he engaged in the acts
constituting his violations of the Act and Regulations as set forth above. Therefore,
pursuant to Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(a)(1)(B), NHM, as Bloomâs
principal, is liable for Bloomâs acts in violations of Sections 4b(a}(2)()-(iii), 4e(b) and 40(1)

March 3, 2015

Federal Court in New York Imposes a $26 Million Civil Monetary Penalty against Mark
Evan Bloom and his Company, North Hills Management, LLC, for Commodity Pool Fraud

Bloom pleaded guilty in a parallel criminal proceeding and is currently
awaiting sentencing

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced that Judge John G. Koeltl
of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a Supplemental Consent Order requiring
Defendants Mark Evan Bloom of Monmouth Beach, New Jersey, and his firm North Hills Management, LLC (NHM)
jointly to pay a $26 million civil monetary penalty for operating a fraudulent commodity pool called North Hills LP
(North Hills) and misappropriating customer funds (see CFTC Press Release and Complaint 5622-09, February 25, 2009).
The Supplemental Consent Order resolves the CFTCâs case in its entirety.

Previously, on June 11, 2010, the court entered a Consent Order of permanent injunction against the Defendants (see the
Consent Order under Related Links). In the Consent Order, the court found that Bloom and NHM misappropriated
approximately $13 million from North Hills, which they operated from at least 2002 until February 2009. During this
period, Bloom maintained a lavish lifestyle, including purchasing a luxury apartment in Manhattan for over $5 million. The
Consent Order also found that Bloom and NHM concealed their misappropriation and made several other
misrepresentations and material omissions to pool participants. For example, they failed to disclose that pool
participantsâ assets were invested contrary to their stated investment strategy, and they issued false statements
concerning the nature and status of North Hills and participantsâ interests in it. The Consent Order imposed a permanent
injunction and permanent trading, solicitation, and registration bans against the Defendants.

In February 2009, Bloom was charged in a parallel criminal proceeding based on allegations that are similar to those in
the CFTCâs Complaint (see United States v. Bloom, 1:09-cr-367-JGK (S.D.N.Y.)). On July 30, 2009, Bloom pleaded guilty to
the charges and is currently awaiting sentencing. The plea agreement in Bloomâs criminal case requires him to pay
restitution to investors in an amount to be determined by the court. For this reason, the Supplemental Consent Order in
the CFTCâs case does not mandate restitution.

The CFTC appreciates the assistance of the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York and the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Glenn Chernigoff, Kara Mucha, Alison Wilson,
Rick Glaser, and Gretchen L. Lowe.

ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFFâS EX PARTE
EMERGENCY MOTION FOR STATUTORY RESTRAINING ORDER, EXPEDITED
DISCOVERY, ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE REGARDING PRELIMINARY

INJUNCTION, AND OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF

Plaintiff, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ), has filed a
Complaint for Permanent Injunction and Other Relief and moved, pursuant to Section 6c(a) of
the Commodity Exchange Act (the âActâ), for an ex parte statutory restraining order freezing
assets, and ordering Defendant to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not be issued.
The Court has considered the pleadings, declarations, cxhibits, and memorandum filed in support
of the Commissionâs for a statutory restraining order, and finds that:

1. This Court has jurisdiction over the parties and over the subject matter of this
action pursuant to Sections 2(c)(2) and 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 2(c)(2) and 13a-1 (2012).

2. Venue lies properly within this District pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act, 7
U.S.C. Â§13a-1(e) (2012).

3. There is good cause to believe that Jerry Stauffer (âStaufferâ or âDefendantâââ),

has engaged in, is engaging in and is about to engage in acts in violation of Sections 4b(a)(2)(A)-
Case 1:15-cv-00201-PLM *SEALED* Doc #7 ***NOT ON PUBLIC DOCKET*** Filed 02/25/15 Page 2
of 13 Page ID#141

(C) and 40(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6b(a)(2)(A)-(C), and 60(1) (2012), and Regulations 4.20
and 5.2(b), 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 4.20 and 5.2(b), (2014).

4. From as early as June 2010 through the present, Stauffer defrauded at least 9
members of the public of at Icast $968,000 in connection with pooled investments in retail off-
exchange foreign currency contracts (âforexâ). To entice members of the public to participate in
the pool, Defendant guaranteed pool participants a monthly return on their investment based on
profits purportedly earned from forex trading. In reality, Defendant never traded forex as he told
pool participants; rather, of the approximately $968,000 provided by pool participants to
Defendant for forex trading, only $200,000 was deposited into trading accounts, approximately
$144,000 was withdrawn, and approximately $45,000 was lost trading. Defendant used pool
participant funds to pay personal credit card bills and expenses, and transferred funds to his boat
company, Atlantic Boat Brokers. To perpctuate his fraud, Defendant prepared and distributed to
pool participants trading statements that indicated successful trading, but in fact, falsely
represented that trading occurred and the purported amount of pool participant funds contained
in the poolâs supposed trading account.

5. There is good cause to belicve that immediate and irreparable damage to the
Courtâs ability to grant effective final relief for pool participants in the form of monetary redress
will occur from the sale, transfer, assignment, or other disposition by Defendant of assets or
records unless Defendant is immediately restrained and enjoined by Order of the Court.

6. There is good cause for the Court to freeze assets owned, controlled, managed, or
held by or on behalf of, or for the bencfit of Defendant.

7. There is good cause for entry of an order prohibiting Defendant, his agents,

servants, cmployces, assigns, atterneys; and persons in active concert or participation with
Case 1:15-cv-00201-PLM *SEALED* Doc #7 ***NOT ON PUBLIC DOCKET** Filed 02/25/15 Page 3
of 13 Page ID#142

Defendant, including any successor thereof, from destroying records and/or denying agents of
the Commission access to inspect and copy records to ensure that Commission representatives
have immediate and complete access to those books and records.

8. There is good cause for the Plaintiff to conduct expedited discovery in order to
determine the full extent of Defendantâs alleged wrongdoing, locate Defendantâs other pool
participants, identify pool participant funds and other assets of Defendant and clarify the source
and whereabouts of various funds.

9. Absent the entry of this statutory restraining order, Defendant is likely to dissipate
or transfer assets and destroy business records.

10.â This is a proper case for granting an ex parte statutory restraining order to
preserve the status quo, protect public pool participants from loss and damage, and cnable the
Commission to fulfill its statutory duties, therefore the Court orders as follows:

CFTC Charges Michigan Resident Jerry Stauffer with Commodity Pool Fraud and Other
Violations

Federal Court Issues Emergency Order Freezing Staufferâs Assets and
Protecting Books and Records

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced that Chief Judge Paul L.
Maloney, of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan issued an emergency Order freezing and
preserving the remaining pool participant assets under the control of Defendant Jerry Stauffer of Traverse City,
Michigan. The Order, entered under seal on February 25, 2015, also prohibits Stauffer from destroying books and records
and grants the CFTC immediate access to those records.

The Order arises out of a civil enforcement Complaint filed under seal by the CFTC on the same date, charging Stauffer
with fraudulently soliciting at least $968,000 from members of the public to trade foreign exchange (forex) ina
commodity pool, by among other things, guaranteeing pool participants a monthly return on their investment based on
profits purportedly earned from forex trading. The CFTC Complaint further alleges that Stauffer prepared and distributed
to pool participants false account statements showing huge profits, while at the same time he traded very little forex and
diverted pool participantsâ funds for his own use. In addition to fraud, the Complaint alleges that Stauffer illegally
operated a commodity pool.

In its continuing litigation, the CFTC seeks full restitution to defrauded pool participants, disgorgement of any ill-gotten
gains, the payment of appropriate monetary penalties, permanent registration and trading bans, and a permanent
injunction from future violations of federal commodities laws, as charged.

The CFTC appreciates the cooperation of the Civil Division of the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Western District of
Michigan and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter.

CFTC Division Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Eugenia Vroustouris, Michelle Bougas, Kathy
Banar, Erica Bodin, and Rick Glaser.

In the Matter of:

 

ICE Futures U.S., Inc.,
CFTC Docket No. 15 - 17 Proceedings Clerk

LS 11:05 am, Mar 16, a,

 

 

Respondent.

 

ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTIONS 6(c) AND 6(d) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, MAKING
FINDINGS AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

I.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ) has reason to believe that
from at least in or about October 2012 to at least May 2014 (âRelevant Periodâ), ICE Futures
USS., Inc. (âRespondentâ) violated Commission Regulations (âRegulationsâ) 16.00, 16.01, and
16.02, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 16.00, 16.01, & 16.02 (2014). Therefore, the Commission deems it
appropriate and in the public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are,
instituted to determine whether Respondent engaged in the violations set forth herein and to
determine whether any order should be issued imposing remedial sanctions.

I.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Respondent has
submitted an Offer of Settlement (âOfferâ), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Without admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, Respondent consents to
the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 6(c) and 6(d) of the
Commodity Exchange Act, Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (âOrderââ) and
acknowledge service of this Order.

 

Respondent consents to the entry of this Order and to the use of these findings in this
proceeding and in any other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission
is a party; provided, however, that Respondent does not consent to the use of the Offer, or the
findings or conclusions in this Order consented to in the Offer, as the sole basis for any other
proceeding brought by the Commission, other than in a proceeding in bankruptcy or to enforce
the terms of this Order. Nor does Respondent consent to the use of the Offer or this Order, or the
findings or conclusions in this Order consented to in the Offer, by any other party in any other
proceeding.

 
TI.
The Commission finds the following:
A. SUMMARY

ICE Futures U.S. is a designated contract market (âDCMâ). As a DCM, ICE Futures
US. is required to submit certain trading and market-related reports and data to the Commission.
In particular, ICE Futures U.S. is required to submit, for each business day, clearing member
reports âshowing for each clearing member, by proprietary and customer account,â certain
information for each future or option contract, including among other things, the quantity of
contracts currently open, the quantity of contracts bought and sold throughout the day, and the
quantity of delivery notices. 17 C.F.R. Â§ 16.00. ICE Futures U.S. is also required to provide the
Commission permanent record data relating to trading volume, open contracts, prices, and
certain critical dates, and transaction-level trade data and related order information for each
futures or options contract. 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 16.01 and 16.02.

Reporting is at the heart of the Commissionâs market and financial surveillance
programs, which are critical to the Commissionâs mission to protect market participants and
promote market integrity. The Commissionâs market surveillance programs analyze market data
to detect and prevent market disruptions and enforce speculative position limits. The
Commissionâs financial surveillance programs use market data to measure the financial risks that
large contract positions may pose to Commission registrants and clearing organizations, All of
these programs, along with much of the Commissionâs other work, rely on accurate and complete
market reports and data.

Throughout the Relevant Period (which consisted of approximately 325 reporting days),
ICE Futures U.S. failed to meet its reporting obligations to the Commission by submitting
reports and data that, in aggregate, contained thousands of errors and omissions. According to
ICE Futures U.S., these errors and omissions resulted primarily from technology upgrades and
data migration projects, and while they affected data provided to the Commission, they did not
affect data published by ICE Futures U.S. on its website. Many of the inaccurate and incomplete
reports made by ICE Futures U.S. occurred after Commission staff informed ICE Futures U.S. of
the reporting problems and requested that the problems be corrected. With respect to permanent
record data, ICE Futures U.S. failed to report any data (including delivery notices) for certain
expiring futures contracts after the last trading day, and it reported incorrect intraday futures
prices, numbers of delivery notices, option strike prices, and volumes for exchanges of futures.
ICE Futures U.S. also failed to submit clearing member reports for the expiring futures contract
after the last trading day, and it failed to submit any transaction-level data on six separate days
for certain energy contracts.

B. RESPONDENT

ICE Futures U.S. is and was, at all times during the Relevant Period, a Delaware
corporation, a board of trade designated as a contract market, and self-regulatory organization.
ICE Futures U.S. is located in New York, New York and lists approximately 500 futures and
options contracts on a wide range of products, including natural gas and power, agricultural
commodities, equity indexes, and currencies.

C, FACTS
l, Regulatory Requirements for DCM Reporting

The Commission oversees a comprehensive reporting system by which it collects
information on (1) the prices and volume of trading in the different futures and options markets;
(2) individual transactions in those markets; and (3) market participants. This information forms
the foundation of the Commissionâs market and financial surveillance programs.

Each DCM is required to submit to the Commission clearing member reports for each
business day. Specifically, each DCM must submit:

The following information separately for futures by commodity and by future,
and, for options, by underlying futures contract (for options on futures contracts)
or by underlying commodity (for other commodity options), and by put, by call,
by expiration date, and by strike price: (1) The total of ail long open contracts and
the total of all short open contracts carried at the end of the day covered by the
report... .; (2) The quantity of contracts bought and the quantity of contracts sold
during the day of the report . . .; (4) The quantity of purchases of futures for
commodities or for derivatives positions and the quantity of sales of futures for
commodities or for derivative positions . . .; (5) For futures, the quantity of the
commodity for which delivery notices have been issued by the clearing
organization of the reporting market and the quantity for which notices have been
stopped during the day covered by the report.

17 C.F.R. Â§ 16,00(a) (2014). For each clearing member, therefore, each DCM must report,
among other things, the number of open futures or option positions and the number of delivery
notices issued or stopped. Jd.

Each DCM also must submit to the Commission permanent record data, which consists of
summary data for each futures contract, option, swap, and option on swap, including the
following volume data:

(i) the option delta, where a delta system is used; (ii) the total gross open contracts
for futures, excluding those contracts against which delivery notices have been
stopped; (iii) for futures products that specify delivery, open contracts against
which delivery notices have been issued on that business day; (iv) the total
volume of trading, excluding transfer trades or office trades; ... (v) the total
volume of futures/options/swaps/swaptions exchanged for commodities or for
derivative positions that are included in the total volume of trading; and (vi) the
total volume of block trades included in the total volume of trading.

17 C.F.R. Â§ 16.01(a) (2014). Permanent record data also includes specific price information,
reported separately for each futures contract, âby commodity and by futures expiration,â and for

 
each option, âby underlying futures contract[] for options on futures or by underlying commodity
for options on commodities, and by put, by call, by expiration date and by strike price.â 17
C.F.R. Â§ 16.01(b)(1I)G@) & (2) (2014). Additionally, each DCM must submit, for the trading
session and for the opening and closing periods of trading:

(i) The opening and closing prices of each futures [or] option... ; (4) The price
that is used for settlement purposes, if different from the closing price; and (iit)
The lowest price of a sale or offer, whichever is lower, and the highest price of a
sale or bid, whichever is higher, that the reporting market reasonably determines
accurately reflects market conditions ....

17 C.F.R. Â§ 16.01(b)(2). As such, for each contract, the Commission receives information about
open interest, delivery notices, and various price points.

Finally, each DCM is required to submit to the Commission certain transaction-level data
daily. 17 C.F.R. Â§ 16.02. This data gives a transaction-by-transaction picture of what occurred
in each market that day, It includes all transactions that happened on any day, regardless of size.

The Commission uses the clearing member reports, permanent record data, and
transaction-level data, among other things, as part of its market and financial surveillance
programs, to detect and prevent situations that could pose a threat to the markets and to keep the
Commission informed of significant market developments. The effectiveness of the
Commissionâs market and financial surveillance programs depends on accurate and timely
reporting from DCMs.

2. ICE Futures U.S.âs Data Reporting Errors

Beginning as early as October 2012 and continuing throughout 2013, Commission staff
identified a series of errors and omissions in ICE Futures U.S.âs clearing member reports,
permanent record data, and transaction-level data. In some instances, data was missingâsuch as
trading dates for which the Commission received no reports for ICE Futures U.S.âs energy
markets. In other instances, the errors only became apparent when Commission staff discovered
discrepancies between the transaction-level data and the summary data reported for certain
trading days. Commission staff identified further errors by detecting differences between the
data the Commission received and the data ICE Futures U.S. published on its website in its Daily
Market Reports. Finally, some errors were apparent on the face of the reported data (e.g., certain
natural gas settlement prices in October-November 2012 were reported at 1000 times their actual
level),

From October 2012 and continuing until April 2013, ICE Futures U.S. was engaged in
significant technology upgrades related to the Commissionâs then-upcoming requirement of a
new data-reporting format and ICE Futures U.S.âs own transition of existing over-the-counter
energy swaps into listed energy futures. These projects involved migrating data from ICE
Futures U.S.âs old reporting system to a new system, and the associated technology upgrades
introduced software logic errors that resulted in most of the reporting errors and omissions made
by ICE Futures U.S. to the Commission.

 
These reporting errors and omissions cumulatively numbered in the thousands and
affected certain data in ICE Futures U.S.âs Part 16 reports for every reporting day over the
Relevant Period and included: |

e reporting incorrect high/low and open/close options prices in a variety of contracts,
including coffee, cocoa, sugar, cotton, frozen concentrated orange juice, and the U.S.
dollar index;

e reporting incorrect settlement prices in natural gas options;

Â® reporting incorrect strike prices or failing to report strike prices in certain natural gas
options;

e reporting inaccurate information in currency and cross-rate futures;

e reporting inaccurate delivery notices in numerous contracts, including coffee, cocoa,
cotton, and frozen concentrated orange juice;

Â® reporting inaccurate volumes in Exchange for Related Product trades;

e failing to report any information after the last trading day for certain futures contracts,
including clearing member reports for those dates; and

e failing to submit any transaction-level data for certain energy contracts.

3. ICE Futures U.S.âs Communications with the Commission Regarding Data
Reporting Deficiencies

At the beginning of the Relevant Period and at various times during 2013, Commission
staff notified ICE Futures U.S. about the data errors and omissions. ICE Futures U.S. responded
that its data reporting deficiencies would be corrected with the conversion to the new data-
reporting format that was set to be implemented by the Commission in September 2013 (but later
delayed), Commission staff represented to ICE Futures U.S. that continuing to report faulty data
in the interim was unacceptable, Nevertheless, ICE Futures U.S. continued to submit inaccurate
and incomplete reports. Further, even after the Commission implemented the new data-reporting
standards in February 2014, certain ICE Futures U.S. reports still contained previously identified
data errors; although, the quality of ICE Futures U.S.âs data reports overall did improve after the
_data-reporting conversion.

During the Relevant Period and extending through much of the Division of
Enforcementâs investigation of this matter, ICE Futures U.S. did not respond in a timely and
satisfactory manner to inquiries from Commission staffâincluding staff from the Division of
Market Oversight, the Office of Data Technology, and the Division of Enforcementâabout these
data reporting issues. Eventually, ICE Futures U.S. did cooperate fully with the Division of
Enforcementâs investigation and took corrective actions to address these reporting deficiencies.
The Commission has taken that cooperation and those actions into account in settling this matter.
IV.
LEGAL DISCUSSION

ICE Futures U.S, violated Regulations 16.00, 16.01, and 16.02 when it submitted inaccurate
and incomplete reports and data during the Relevant Period. As described more fully in the
Regulatory Requirements for DCM Reporting section above, these Regulations require a DCM to
submit to the Commission daily clearing member reports (Regulation 16.00), permanent record data
(Regulation 16.01), and transaction-level data (Regulation 16.02). Inherent in these requirements is the
fundamental notion that all reports and data provided to the Commission must be accurate and
complete. See in re JP Morgan Securities LLC, CFTC No. 14-19 Guly 29, 2014); In re Bielfeldt,
CFTC No. 96-1 (Feb. 12, 1999),

The accuracy and completeness of these reports and data are critical to the Commissionâs
mission to protect market participants and to ensure market integrity. See, e.g, Inre JP Morgan
Securities LLC, CFTC No. 14-19 (July 29, 2014); In re Newedge USA, LLC, CFTC No. 12-06 Jan. 9,
2012). The effectiveness of the Commissionâs market and financial surveillance programs, as
well as other Commission work, hinge upon correct and thorough reporting data. Without
accurate and complete data, the Commissionâs ability to detect and prevent market disruptions,
to enforce speculative position limits, and to measure the financial risks that large contract
positions may pose to Commission registrants and clearing organizations is compromised.

V.
FINDINGS OF VIOLATION

Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that, during the Relevant Period, ICE
Futures U.S, violated Regulations 16.00, 16.01, and 16.02.

CFTC Orders ICE Futures U.S., Inc. to Pay a $3 Million Civil Monetary Penalty for
Recurring Data Reporting Violations

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today issued an Order filing and
simultaneously settling charges against ICE Futures U.S., Inc. (ICE), a designated contract market (DCM), for
submitting inaccurate and incomplete reports and data to the CFTC over at least a 20-month period, from at least
October 2012 through at least May 2014.

According to the CFTC Order, on every reporting day during the period above, ICE submitted reports and data containing
errors and omissions, with cumulative inaccuracies totaling in the thousands. The Order further finds that CFTC staff
repeatedly notified ICE of the problems with its reports and data and requested that ICE take action to correct the
mistakes, but that ICE continued to submit inaccurate reports and data. The Order requires ICE to pay a $3 million civil
monetary penalty and to comply with undertakings aimed at improving its regulatory reporting.

CFTC Director of Enforcement Aitan Goelman commented: âThe CFTC cannot carry out its vital mission of protecting
market participants and ensuring market integrity without correct and complete reporting by registrants, including DCMs.
Todayâs action makes clear that registrants who fail to meet their reporting obligations will be held accountable and that
the CFTC takes a particularly dim view of reporting violations that continue over many months, especially after CFTC staff
has repeatedly alerted the registrant in question to the problems in its reporting.â

Pursuant to Part 16 of the CFTC Regulations, a DCM is required to submit certain trading and market-related reports and
data to the CFTC. In particular, a DCM is required to submit, for each business day, clearing member reports showing
certain information for each future or option contract, including, among other things, the quantity of contracts currently
open, the quantity of contracts bought and sold throughout the day, and the quantity of delivery notices. A DCM is also
required to provide the CFTC with permanent record data relating to trading volume, open contracts, prices, and certain
critical dates, and transaction-level trade data and related order information for each futures or options contract.

The Order specifically finds that, beginning in at least October 2012, CFTC staff notified ICE about its data and reporting
errors, which included incorrect clearing member reports, permanent record data, and transaction-level trade data. ICE
responded that these errors resulted primarily from technology upgrades and data migration projects, and while they
affected data provided to the CFTC, they did not affect data published by ICE on its website. ICE further assured CFTC
staff that its data-reporting problems would be fixed with the conversion to a new data-reporting format. CFTC staff
informed ICE that continuing to report faulty data in the interim was unacceptable. Nevertheless, ICE continued to submit
inaccurate and incomplete reports.

Further, ICE did not respond in a timely and satisfactory manner to inquiries from CFTC staff from multiple divisions about
these data-reporting issues, including initial inquiries from the Division of Enforcement. Eventually, ICE did cooperate
fully with the investigation and took effective corrective actions to address its reporting deficiencies. The CFTC has taken
that cooperation and those actions into account in settling this matter.

In addition to imposing the $3 million civil monetary penalty, the CFTC ordered ICE to comply with undertakings to
improve its regulatory reporting. For instance, ICE must create and maintain a new senior position of Chief Data Officer,
who will have direct responsibility for systems and procedures relating to regulatory reporting, and ICE must hire and
maintain at least three additional quality assurance staff who will be dedicated to regulatory reporting. ICE also must
undertake certain data-reconciliation efforts, including reviewing certain prior data submissions to the CFTC to identify
further violations of the charged CFTC Regulations and, beginning 120 days from the date of the Order, endeavoring to
reconcile data provided to the CFTC with data published on its website, as well as with other data existing within ICEâs
systems and its clearing providersâ systems. Additionally, ICE must correct any errors or omissions in data provided to
the CFTC pursuant to Part 16 of the CFTC Regulations within one week of discovery or notification of the errors or
omissions, or, in the event such corrections will take more than a weekâs time, reporting to the CFTC why additional time
will be necessary.

The CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this matter are Margaret Aisenbrey, Allison Sizemore,
Jeff Le Riche, and Charles Marvine, with assistance from the CFTC Division of Market Oversight staff Kelly Beck, Matthew
Hunter, Harry Hild, and Anthony Saldukas and the CFTC Office of Data and Technology staff Regina Sanders, Margie
Sweet, Rene Garcia, and Ed Wehner.

ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTIONS 6(c) AND 6(d) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, MAKING
FINDINGS AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

I,

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (ââCFTCâ or âCommissionâ) has reason to
believe that Marubeni America Corporation (âRespondentâ) violated Commission Regulation
(âRegulationâ) 19.01, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 19.01 (2014) from July 2010 through August 2013 (the
âRelevant Periodâ). Therefore, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest
that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted to determine whether
Respondent engaged in the violations set forth herein and to determine whether any order should
be issued imposing remedial sanctions.

Il.

In anticipation of the institution of this administrative proceeding, Respondent has
submitted an Offer of Settlement (âOfferâ), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Without admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, Respondent consents to
the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 6(c) and 6(d) of the
Commodity Exchange Act, Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (âOrderâ) and
acknowledges service of this Order.'

 

Respondent consents to the entry of this Order and to the use of these findings in this proceeding and in any other
proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party; provided, however, that Respondent
does not consent to the use of the Offer, or the findings or conclusions in this Order consented to in the Offer, as the
sole basis for any other proceeding brought by the Commission, other than in a proceeding in bankruptcy or to
enforce the terms of this Order. Nor does Respondent consent to the use of the Offer or this Order, or the findings or
conclusions in this Order consented to in the Offer, by any other party in any other proceeding.

 
I.
The Commission finds the following:
A. Summary

Under Regulations 19,.00(a)(1) and 19.01, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§19.00(a)(1) and 19.01 (2014), all
persons holding or controlling reportable futures and options positions in certain agricultural
commodities â including wheat, corn, oats, soybeans, soybean oil, and soybean meal â pursuant
to Regulation 15.00(p)(2), 17 C.F.R. Â§15.00(p)(2) (2014) and any part of which constitute bona
Jide hedging positions as defined in Regulation 1.3(z), 17 C.F.R. Â§1.3(z) (2011), are required to
file CFTC Form 204 reports showing the composition of the fixed price cash position of each
such commodity hedged. During the Relevant Period, Respondent filed 38 Form 204 reports
with the Commission that did not comply with this requirement.

B. Respondent

Marubeni America Corporation (âMACâ) is a New York corporation with its
headquarters in New York City. MAC is the largest overseas subsidiary of Marubeni
Corporation, a Japanese general trading company based in Tokyo, Japan. MAC is a general
trading company that acts as an intermediary, importer/exporter, facilitator or broker in various
types of trade between business enterprises and countries. MAC trades agricultural
commodities, including corn, wheat, soybeans, and soybean meal. MAC has never been
registered with the Commission in any capacity. .

C, Facts

Respondent is a dealer/merchant in agricultural commodities, including ones covered by
CFTC Form 204, which Respondent hedges with futures contracts. During the Relevant Period,
Respondent filed Form 204 reports that incorrectly stated its fixed price cash positions.

The CFTC Form 204 report is to be filed monthly, as of the close of business on the last
Friday of the month, and is to show the composition of the reporting entityâs fixed price cash
position of each commodity hedged, including the quantity of open fixed price purchase and
fixed price sale commitments in such cash commodities. As the instructions for the Form 204
report state, the filer is to â[r]eport in thousands of bushels the entire quantity of cash stocks
owned and open fixed price cash purchases and cash sales of the commodity and its products and
byproducts.â A purpose of the Form 204 report is to check compliance with speculative position
limits by ensuring that filers that classify their futures positions as hedging actually own or
control offsetting cash positions,

During the Relevant Period, Respondent filed 38 erroneous Form 204 reports with the
Commission, which did not accurately state the quantities of Respondentâs fixed price cash
positions of each commodity hedged. Specifically, the positions the Respondent included in its
Form 204 reports included both basis priced and fixed priced cash positions. After the Relevant
Period, Respondent submitted corrected Form 204 reports that included only its fixed price cash
contracts. Respondent has cooperated in the Divisionâs investigation.

 
IV,
LEGAL DISCUSSION
a. Statutory Background

Regulation 150.3 exempts positions that qualify as bona fide hedging transactions (as
defined in Regulation 1.3(z), 17 C.F.R. Â§1.3(z)) from the speculative position limits for various
agricultural commodities set forth in Regulation 150.2. However, such bona fide hedging
transactions are subject to the Commissionâs reporting requirements pursuant to Regulations
19,00(a)(1) and 19.01, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§19.00(a)(1) and 19.01 (2014),

Regulation 19.00(a)(1) requires that persons holding or controlling futures and options
positions in certain agricultural commodities that are reportable pursuant to Regulation
15.00(p)(2), 17 C.F.R. Â§15.00(p)(2) and any part of which constitute bona fide hedging positions
as defined in Regulation 1.3(z), 17 C.F.R. Â§1.3(z), must file CFTC Form 204 reports showing the
composition of the fixed price cash position of each such commodity hedged (the âForm 204
commodities,â which include wheat, corn, oats, soybeans, soybean oil and soybean meal).
Reportable positions under Regulation 15.00(p)(2) are any combined futures and futures-
equivalent option open contract position as defined in Part 150 of the Regulations in any one
month or in all months combined, either net long or net short in any commodity on any one
reporting market, which positions at the close of the market on the last business day of the week
exceed the net quantity limit in spot, single or in all-months fixed in Regulation 150.2 for the
Form 204 commodities, |

b. Respondentâs Violations of Regulation 19.01, 17 C.F.R. Â§19.01 (2014)

During the Relevant Period, Respondent held reportable positions in the Form 204
commodities and was required by Regulation 19.00(a)(1) to file Form 204 reports. Regulation
19.01 requires Form 204 reports to show the quantities of the fixed price purchase and sale open
cash positions of each of the Form 204 commodities hedged.

On 38 occasions during the Relevant Period, Respondent did not comply with Regulation
19.01, 17 C.F.R. Â§19.01, when it submitted Form 204 reports which did not accurately state the
quantities of Respondentâs fixed price open cash positions as required by Regulation 19.01.

Therefore, Respondent violated Regulation 19.01, 17 C.F_R. Â§ 19.01(2014).

CFTC Orders Marubeni America Corporation to Pay $800,000 for Inaccurately Reporting
Positions in Multiple Grains

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today issued an Order filing and
simultaneously settling charges against Marubeni America Corporation (Marubeni), a dealer and merchant of
agricultural commodities and the largest overseas subsidiary of Japan-based Marubeni Corporation, for failing to comply
with its legal obligation to submit accurate monthly CFTC Form 204 Reports, regarding the composition of Marubeniâs
fixed price cash grain purchases and sales, in violation of the reporting requirements in CFTC Regulation 19.01.

As the CFTC Order states, under CFTC Regulations all persons holding or controlling reportable futures and options
positions in certain agricultural commodities (including wheat, corn, oats, soybeans, soybean oil, and soybean meal) and
any part of which constitute bona fide hedging positions as defined in CFTC Regulation 1.3(z), are required to file CFTC
Form 204 reports showing the composition of their fixed price cash position in each such commodity hedged. According
to the Order, a purpose of the Form 204 report is to check compliance with speculative position limits by ensuring that
filers that classify their futures positions as hedging actually own or control offsetting cash positions.

The Order finds that during the period from July 2010 through August 2013, Marubeni held reportable positions in Form
204 commodities and was required to file Form 204 reports showing the quantities of the fixed price purchase and sale
open cash positions of such commodities it hedged. The Order further finds that during the relevant period Marubeni filed
38 Form 204 reports with the CFTC that did not accurately state the quantities of Marubeniâs fixed price cash positions of
each such commodity it hedged. Specifically, the Order finds that Marubeni included in its Form 204 reports both basis
and fixed priced cash positions. As noted in the CFTC Order, Marubeni thereafter submitted corrected Form 204 reports.

The CFTC Order requires Marubeni to pay an $800,000 civil monetary penalty and to cease and desist from committing
further violations of CFTC Regulation 19.01.

Consistent with this filing, the CFTCâs Division of Market Oversight has issued an advisory regarding the obligation of
market participants to submit accurate Form 204 reports (see CFTC Staff Advisory No. 13-42, Obligation of Reportable
Market Participants to File CFTC Form 204 Reports, which is linked in CFTC Press Release 6639-13, July 8, 2013).

The Division of Market Oversight staff members responsible for this matter are Matthew Hunter, Harry Hild, Eugene
Kunda, and David Amato. The Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this action are Jordon Grimm, Linda
Y. Peng, Trevor Kokal, David W. MacGregor, Lenel Hickson, Jr., and Manal M. Sultan.

CFTC Revokes Registrations of John G. Wilkins and His Company, Altamont Global Partners
LLC, Based on Federal Courtâs Permanent Injunction Order and on Wilkinsâs Related
Criminal Conviction

Washington, DCâThe U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced the revocation of the
registrations of Altamont Global Partners LLC (AGP) of Longwood, Florida and its owner, John G. Wilkins, formerly of
Chuluota, Florida. AGP was registered with the CFTC as a Commodity Pool Operator, and Wilkins was registered as an
Associated Person of AGP.

The CFTC initiated revocation proceedings against AGP and Wilkins on November 25, 2014 (see CFTC Press Release
7069-14, November 25, 2014). After AGP and Wilkins failed to participate in the proceedings, CFTC Judgment Officer
Philip V. McGuire issued an Initial Decision on Default (see CFTC Docket No. SD 15-01) on February 23, 2015. The
Judgment Officer found that AGP and Wilkins are subject to statutory disqualification from CFTC registration based on an
Order for entry of default judgment and an amended Order of permanent injunction entered by the U.S. District Court for
the Middle District of Florida that, among other things, (1) found AGP and Wilkins committed fraud by misappropriating
commodity pool funds and by delivering false quarterly account statements to pool participants and (2) enjoined AGP and
Wilkins from further violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act, as charged, and from trading
or applying for registration with the CFTC (see CFTC Press Release 6869-14, February 28, 2014).

The Judgment Officer also found that Wilkins is subject to statutory disqualification based on his felony conviction for
conspiracy to commit mail fraud and wire fraud in connection with these same activities (see United States v. Wilkins, No.
13-cr-181 (M.D. Fla. July 19, 2013)).

The Judgment Officerâs Initial Decision on Default became a final Order of the CFTC on March 25, 2015.
The CFTC thanks the National Futures Association for its assistance in this matter.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Rachel Hayes, Peter Riggs, and Charles
Marvine.

U.S. COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING
COMMISSION, C/A No. 8:13-cev-00327-JDA
Plaintiff,
v. ORDER OF PERMANENT INJUNCTION
ROBERT STANLEY HARRISON,

Defendant.

 

 

On February 6, 2013, Plaintiff filed its five-count Complaint against Defendant, alleging
violations of anti-fraud and registration provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act (âCEAâ)
and CFTC Regulations. (âComplaint,â Dkt. No. 1.) On May 14, 2013, Defendant was indicted
on criminal charges arising from the same fraudulent conduct described in the Complaint. See
United States v. Harrison, 8:13-cr-00354-MGL (D.S.C.). On January 22, 2014, Defendant
pleaded guilty to criminal charges in the indictment, and on September 22, 2014, Defendant was
sentenced to | year and | day in prison and ordered to pay restitution for the same conduct as
described in Plaintiff's Complaint. On December 19, 2014, the Court entered a Consent Order
for Permanent Injunction, Civil Monetary Penalty, and Other Equitable Relief. (âConsent
Order,â Dkt. No. #88.) The Consent Order (1) contains findings of fact and conclusions of law
regarding Defendant's misconduct, (2) provides for a permanent injunction prohibiting
Defendant from future violations of the CEA and Regulations, and (3) imposes a civil monetary
penalty against Defendant. The Consent Order also specifically states that Defendant admits the
allegations of the findings of fact and conclusions of law contained therein. Currently before the

Court is Plaintiff's Motion for Additional Permanent Injunction (âMotionâ) against Defendant,
8:13-cv-00327-JDA Date Filed 03/23/15 Entry Number 102 Page 2of5

pursuant to Section 6c of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2012), prohibiting him from further
participation in the markets regulated by the CFTC. The Court held a hearing on the Motion on
March 23, 2015.

Section 6c(a) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-I(a) (2012), authorizes District Courts to enjoin
any act or practice constituting a violation of the CEA or Regulations and to enforce compliance
with the CEA and Regulations, Permanent trading, solicitation and registration bans are
appropriate when a defendant's violation of the CEA and/or Regulations poses a threat to the
integrity of the markets regulated by the CFTC. See In re Staryk, [2003-2004 Transfer Binder]
Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) Â§ 29,826, at 56,452 (CFTC July 23, 2004) (explaining that a bar
prohibiting a defendant is appropriate when the record shows that a (defendantâs] misconduct
represents an inherent threat to the integrity of the futures markets in the public eye); Jn r2
Miller, [1994-1996 Transfer Binder] CCH 4 26,440, at 42,914 (CFTC June 16, 1995), remanded
on other grounds, Miller v. CFTC, 197 F.3d 1227 (9th Cir. 1999) (CFTC affirming with âno
difficultyâ the trial courtâs permanent trading ban because defendantâs pattern of wrongdoing
that extended over several years posed a danger to the integrity of the market sufficient to
warrant a permanent ban).

Because fraud is one of the primary threats to market integrity, many district courts
throughout the Fourth Circuit have imposed permanent bans on market activity in response to the
same types of fraudulent conduct engaged in by Defendant. See e.g., CFTC v. Heffernan, No.

As the admissions contained in the Consent Order and Defendantâs guilty plea
demonstrate, Defendant's conduct poses a significant threat to the integrity of the markets
regulated by the CFTC. Defendant admitted to repeatedly committing core violations of the
CEA and Regulations by devising and executing ââa scheme to defraud and to obtain monies by
means of false and fraudulent pretenses, representations, and promises.â (Consent Order, Dkt.
No. #88, at Â§. 17.) Additionally, Defendant admitted to accepting funds in his own name and
commingling funds he accepted with his own funds. (Consent Order, Dkt. No. #88, at Â§ 24.)

Upon consideration of Plaintiff's Motion and Defendant's response thereto and for good
cause shown:

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Defendant is permanently restrained, enjoined, and
prohibited from directly or indirectly:

l. Trading on or subject to the rules of any registered entity (as that term is defined
in Section la of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. Â§ la (2012));

2. Entering into any transactions involving commodity futures, options on commodity
futures, commodity options (as that term is defined in Regulation |.3 (hh), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.3(hh)

Sections 2(c)(2)(B) and 2(c)(2)(C)(i) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 2(c)(2)(B) and 2(c)(2)(C)(i) (2012)),

and/or swaps (as that term is defined in Section la(47) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1a(47) (2012), and
8:13-cv-00327-JDA Date Filed 03/23/15 fntry Number 102 Page4of5

as further defined by Regulation 1.3(xxx), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.3(xxx) (2014)) for his own personal
account or for any account in which he has a direct or indirect interest;

3. Having any commodity futures, options on commodity futures, commodity
options, security futures products, forex contracts, and/or swaps traded on his behalf;

4, Controlling or directing the trading for or on behalf of any other person or entity,
whether by power of attorney or otherwise, in any account involving commodity futures, options

4.14(a)(9) (2014); and

7. Acting as a principal (as that term is defined in Regulation 3.1(a), 17 C.F.R.

Â§ 3.1(a) (2014)), agent or any other officer or employee of any person (as that term is defined in
Section la of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. Â§ la (2012)) registered, exempted from registration or required
to be registered with the CFTC except as provided for in Regulation 4.14(a)(9), 17 C.F.R.

Â§ 4.14(a)(9) (2014).

 

""The Court notes that, during the hearing, counsel for Defendant requested that the Court include
a provision in this Order allowing Defendant to seek a lift of the permanent injunction if the facts
and/or circumstances of this case change. The Court declines to include such a provision;
however, if Defendant thinks the facts and/or circumstances change sufficient to warrant a lift of
the permanent injunction, he may file a motion to Jift the injunction at that time.

Federal Court in South Carolina Imposes Lifetime Ban from Commodities Industry on
Robert Stanley Harrison

The CFTC Charged Harrison with Commodity Pool Fraud in 2013

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced that Magistrate Judge
Jacquelyn D. Austin of the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina entered an additional Order of permanent
injunction against Robert Stanley Harrison of Easley, South Carolina, permanently banning him from engaging in
commodity-related activity.

In entering the Order banning Harrison from the regulated commodities industry, the Court held that âDefendantâs
conduct poses a significant threat to the integrity of the markets regulated by the CFTC.â The Order, entered on March
23, 2015, permanently bans Harrison from trading in a broad range of commodity-related markets for himself or others,
managing customer accounts, and registering with the CFTC in any capacity.

The Order stems from a CFTC civil enforcement Complaint filed on February 6, 2013 (see CFTC Press Release 6513-13)
and a Consent Order of permanent injunction against Harrison entered by the Court on December 19, 2014 (see CFTC
Press Release 7093-14). The December Order found that Harrison, while acting as an unregistered Commodity Pool
Operator, fraudulently solicited, issued false statements, and misappropriated funds in connection with the operation of
the Investors Choice Advisors commodity pool from June 2011 to February 2013. This Order required Harrison to pay
a $275,000 civil monetary penalty and resolved the case in its entirety, except for the imposition of permanent trading
and registration bans.

Harrison Indicted on Criminal Charges and Sentenced to Prison

On May 14, 2013, Harrison was indicted on criminal charges arising from the same fraudulent conduct that was the
subject of the CFTCâs action (see United States v. Harrison, 8:13-cr-00354-MGL (D.S.C.)). Harrison pleaded guilty to these
charges and on September 22, 2014, was sentenced to 1 year and 1 day in prison and ordered to pay restitution to
victims of his fraud.

The CFTC appreciates the assistance of the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the District of South Carolina and the South
Carolina Attorney Generalâs Office.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this action are Amanda Burks, Daniel Jordan, Michael
Loconte, Erica Bodin, and Rick Glaser.

CFTCâs Foreign Currency (Forex) Fraud and Commodity Pool Fraud Advisories

The CFTC has issued several customer protection Fraud Advisories that provide the warning signs of fraud, including the
Foreign Currency Trading (Forex) Fraud Advisory, which states that the CFTC has witnessed a sharp rise in Forex trading
scams in recent years and helps customers identify this potential fraud.

The CFTC has also issued a Commodity Pool Fraud Advisory, which warns customers about a type of fraud that involves
individuals and firms, often unregistered, offering investments in commodity pools.

Customers can report suspicious activities or information, such as possible violations of commodity trading laws, to the

CONSENT ORDER FOR PERMANENT INJUNCTION, CIVIL MONETARY
PENALTY AND OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF AGAINST DANIEL SHAK

1, INTRODUCTION

On September 30, 2014, Plaintiff U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission
(âCommissionâ or âCFTCâ) filed a one-count Complaint (Dkt. No. 1) against Daniel Shak
(âShakâ) seeking civil monetary penalties, injunctive and other equitable relief for a violation of
the Commodity Exchange Act (âActâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1 et seq. (2012). Specifically, after
voluntarily consenting to an Administrative Order! (âCFTC Orderâ) issued by the CFTC in
November 2013 prohibiting him from engaging in certain commodity futures trading during the
daily closing period, six months later Shak violated the CFTC Order by trading two outrightâ
June 2014 gold futures contracts during the closing period on May 22, 2014 (âthe Tradeââ) - the
exact type of commodity futures trading that he agreed to be banned from trading. Shak now
consents to the entry of this order for permanent injunction, civil monetary penalty and other

equitable relief, which resolves this litigation between the parties in its entirety, as follows:

THE PARTIES AGREE AND THE COURT HEREBY FINDS:

A. Findings of Fact
1. Parties to This Consent Order

13. Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an independent federal

regulatory agency that is charged by Congress with administering and enforcing the Act and the
Case 1:14-cv-01632-EGS Document9 Filed 03/27/15 Page 5 of 12

Commissionâs Regulations (âRegulationsâ) promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1.1 ef seq.
(2014).

14. Defendant Daniel Shak is an individual residing in Las Vegas, Nevada. Shak ts
registered with the Commission as a floor broker. Shak is a member of New York Mercantile
Exchange, a designated contract market.

2. Prior CFTC Order

15. On November 25, 2013, the Commission issued the CFTC Order instituting
administrative proceedings pursuant to Sections 6(c), 6(d), and 8a of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 9. 13b,
and 12a(1) (2012), against Shak and SHK Management LLC, a registered commodity pool
operator (âCPOâ) managed by Shak, and simultaneously accepted Shakâs Offer of Settlement.

16. As recited in the CFTC Order, in which the CFTC made findings of fact and
conclusions of law and imposed remedial sanctions, Shak and SHK Management LLC, his CPO,
attempted to manipulate the price of Light Sweet Crude Oil (âWTIâ) futures contracts traded on
the New York Mercantile Exchange (âNYMEXâ) on two trading days in 2008. In addition, the
CFTC Order found that Shak and his CPO violated the intraday spot month speculative position
limits for WTI futures contracts on those two trading days.

17. Shak, represented by counsel, neither admitted nor denied the allegations and
conclusions contained in the CFTC Order, and consented to the CFTC Order that required,
among other things. Shak to refrain from certain trading activity. Specifically, the CFTC Order
at Section V1.(4).(b). prohibited Shak:

For a period of two years, trading outrights, directly or indirectly, on or subject to the

rules of a registered entity, as registered entity is defined in Section la of the Act, as

amended by the CRA and the Dodd-Frank Act. to be codified at 7 U.S.C. Â§ la, from the
beginning of the closing period for trading until the end of the closing period for any
commodity futures, options on commodity futures, commodity options, security futures

products, swaps, and/or foreign currency, or any other product or financial instrument
regulated presently or in the future by the Commission.

3. Conduct in Violation of the CFTC Order

18. Open Outcry trading in the Gold Futures pit occurs Monday through Friday from
9:20 a.m. to 1:30 p.m., eastern time. Trading in the close. as designated by the New York
Mercantile Exchange, occurs during the last minute before the end of trading in the pit. As such,
trades cxecuted between 1:29:00 to 1:30:00 p.m. eastern time are considered executed during the
closing period.

19, On Thursday, May 22, 2014, six months after issuance of the CFTC Order, Shak
bought two outright, June 2014 gold futures contracts at 1:29:14 seconds eastern time, 46
seconds before the close of the market. Thus, Shakâs trades occurred during the closing period in

violation of the CFTC Order. This was a one-time incident involving a 2-lot trade.

B. Conclusions of Law
1. Jurisdiction and Venue

20. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2012),
which provides that whenever it shall appear to the Commission that any person has engaged, is

practice, or to enforce compliance with the Act, or any rule, regulation or order thereunder.

21. Venue properly lies with this Court pursuant to 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(e) (2012),
because the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business alleged to have violated the Act
occurred, arc occurring, and/or are about to occur within this District, the Commission is located

in this District, and the CFTC Order was issued from this District.
Case 1:14-cv-01632-EGS Document9 Filed 03/27/15 Page 7 of 12

period until the end of the closing period for any commodity futures, options on commodity
futures, commodity options, security futures products, swaps, and/or foreign currency, or any other
product or financial instrument regulated presently or in the future by the Commission.

23. On Thursday, May 22, 2014, six months after issuance of the CFTC Order, Shak
bought two outright, June 2014 gold futures contracts during the closing period.

24. The Trade violated Section VI.(4).(b).of the CFTC Order.

25. âIn violating the CFTC Order, Shak violated 7 U.S.C. Â§ 9(4) (2012).

CFTC Settles Enforcement Action in District Court against Daniel Shak for Violation of a
CFTC Administrative Order

Court Orders Shak to Pay a $100,000 Fine for Violating the CFTCâs
Order

Washington, DC â The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced that on March 27, 2015,
Judge Emmet G. Sullivan of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia entered a Consent Order of permanent
injunction against Defendant Daniel Shak of Las Vegas, Nevada, for his violation of a CFTC Administrative Order (CFTC
Order) entered on November 25, 2013. The Courtâs Consent Order requires Shak, among other things, to pay a $100,000
civil monetary penalty to settle CFTC civil charges that Shak violated the terms of the CFTC Order.

The CFTC Order, to which Shak consented, charged Shak and his company, SHK Management LLC, with attempting to
manipulate the price of crude oil futures contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange and violating speculative
position limits on two days in 2008. The CFTC Order, among other things, prohibited Shak from trading outright futures
contracts in any market during the closing period for a two-year period starting on the date the CFTC Order was entered
(see CFTC Press Release and CFTC Order 6781-13, November 25, 2013). Six months later, Shak violated the CFTC Order
by trading two outright gold futures contracts during the closing period on May 22, 2014 - the exact kind of commodity
futures trading that he agreed to be banned from trading (see CFTC Press Release and Civil Complaint 7020-14).

Division of Enforcement Director Aitan Goelman commented: âThe CFTC is committed to aggressive enforcement and
policing of our financial markets. This includes ensuring compliance with Commission Orders entered against wrongdoers.
Failure to follow a Commission Order will result in further sanctions.â

The Consent Order also extends Shakâs prohibition from trading outright futures contracts in any market during the
closing period for a two-year period from the date of the Consent Order.

CFTC staff members responsible for this case are Jennifer Diamond, James H. Holl, Ill, and Rick Glaser.

Defendants.

 

 

Sealed Order Granting Plaintiffâs Ex Parte Motion for Statutory Restraining Order
Plaintiff, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ or

âCFTCâ), has filed a Complaint for Permanent Injunction and Other Relief, and has moved,

pursuant to Section 6c(a) of the Commodity Exchange Act (the âActâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(a)

(2012), for an ex parte statutory restraining order enjoining defendants Wesley Allen Brown

 

(âBrownâ), Edward Rubin (âRubinâ) and Maverick International, Inc. (âMaverickâ)
(collectively the âDefendantsââ) from destroying, altering, or disposing of, or refusing to
permit authorized representatives of the Commission to inspect and copy any books or
records or other documents, including electronically stored information (âESIâ), and further
enjoining Defendants from withdrawing, transferring, removing, dissipating, or disposing of
any funds, assets or other property. The Court has considered the pleadings, declarations,

exhibits, and memorandum filed in support of the Commissionâs motion for a statutory

restraining order, and finds that:

 
l. This Court has jurisdiction over the parties and over the subject matter of this
action pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2012), and Section 2(c)(2) of the
Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(c)(2) (2012).

2. Venue lies properly within this District pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act, 7
U.S.C. 13a-1(e) (2012) in that the acts or practices described in the Complaint took place
within this District.

3. There is good cause to believe that Defendants have engaged in, and may

 

continue to engage in certain unlawful conduct, including, but not limited to:
| misappropriating participantsâ funds, making affirmative material misrepresentations to pool _
participants and/or prospective pool participants, acting as an unlawfully unregistered
commodity pool operator (âCPOâ) or'an unlawfully unregistered associated person (âAPâ) of
a CPO, improperly commingling pool participantsâ funds with personal and other business-
related funds, and engaging in other acts, practices or a course of business that defrauded
pool participants or prospective pool participants, operated as a fraud or deceit on pool
participants, cheated or defrauded or attempted to cheat or defraud other persons, or willfully

deceived or attempted to deceive other persons.in connection with a pooled investment

vehicle that is not an eligible contract participant (âECPâ), as defined by Section 1a(11) of
the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1a(11) (2012), in connection with leveraged, margined or financed
foreign currency transactions (âforexâ) as described in Section 2(c)(2)(C)(i) of the Act, 7
U.S.C. Â§ 2(c)(2)(C)() (which are subject to the anti-fraud provisions of Section 4b(a)(2)(A)
and (C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6b(a)(2)(A), (C), pursuant to Sections 2(\(2\(C)GID and

2(c)(2)(C)(iv) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 2(c)(2)(C) 1) (D, 2(c)(2)(C)(Gv)), in violation of

 

 

 

 
|
|

Sections 2(c)(2)(C)(iii)(D(ce), 4b(a)(2)(A), (C), and 40(1)(A)-(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
|

Â§Â§ 2(c)(2)(C)(iii)(D(cc), 6b(a)(2)(A), (C) and 60(1)(A)-(B) (2012), and Commission

Regulation 5.3(a)(2)(i) and (ii), 17 C.F.R. Â§5.3(a)(2)(i) and (ii) (2014).

4, There is good cause to believe that immediate and irreparable damage to the

Courtâs ability to grant effective final relief for customers in the form of monetary redress

|

will occur from the continued sale, transfer, assignment, or other disposition by Defendants

of assets or records unless Defendants are immediately restrained and enjoined by Order of
the Court. !

|
5. There is good cause for the Court to impose a restraining order prohibiting

Defendants and their agents, servants, employees, attorneys, and other persons who are in
active concert or participation with them, from withdrawing, transferring, removing,
dissipating, or disposing of any funds, assets, or other property owned, controlled, managed,

or held by or on behalf of, or for the benefit of Defendants.
|

6. There is good cause for entry of an order prohibiting Defendants, and their
|

. |, . er
agents, servants, employees, assigns, attorneys, and persons in active concert or participation
! |

with the Defendants, including any successor thereof, from destroying records and/or

|
denying agents of the Commission access to inspect and copy records to ensure that

|
Commission representatives have immediate and complete access to all such books and

records.
7. Absent the entry of this statutory restraining order, the Defendants are likely

|

to dissipate or transfer assets and destroy business records.
|
!
!
8. This is a proper case for granting a statutory restraining order ex parte to

. |
preserve the status quo, protect public customers from loss and damage, and enable the

Commission to fulfill its statutory duties, therefore the Court orders as follows:
|

CFTC Charges Maverick International, Inc. and its Principals Wesley Allen Brown and
Edward Rubin with Pool Fraud and Other Violations

Washington, DC â The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) announced the filing of a civil enforcement
action in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, charging Defendants Maverick International, Inc. and
its principals, Wesley Allen Brown and Edward Rubin, with operating a fraudulent commodity pool and other
violations of federal commodity laws. Maverick International, Inc. purportedly maintains offices in Wilmington, Delaware;
however, its address is actually the address of a mail forwarding service. Brown currently resides in North Myrtle Beach,
South Carolina, and Rubin resides in Winnabow, North Carolina.

The CFTC Complaint was filed under seal on March 23, 2015, and on March 26, 2015, U.S. District Court Judge Brian J.
Davis issued an emergency Order freezing and preserving assets under Defendantsâ control and prohibiting them from
destroying documents or denying CFTC staff access to their books and records. The Court scheduled a hearing for April
8, 2015, on the CFTCâs motion for a preliminary injunction.

The CFTC Complaint charges that, as early as June 18, 2008, Defendants solicited and accepted more than $2 million
from members of the public to trade commodity futures contracts in a commodity pool. As alleged, the Defendants
misappropriated all of the $2 million to pay their personal and business expenses, including rent, meals, and more than
$200,000 in cash withdrawals.

The Complaint alleges that Brown used his position as an associate pastor at a Flagler Beach, Florida, church to solicit
congregants to participate in the fraudulent scheme. Through in-person solicitations and the Defendantsâ website
(wealthnavigator.org), Brown represented to actual and potential participants that the Defendants profitably traded
commodity futures and precious metals on behalf of participants. These representations were false, because Defendants
misappropriated all of the participantsâ funds, and no trading on behalf of participants took place, according to the
Complaint.

In its continuing litigation, the CFTC seeks full restitution to defrauded pool participants, disgorgement of any ill-gotten
gains, a civil monetary penalty, permanent registration and trading bans, and a permanent injunction against future
violations of federal commodities laws, as charged.

The CFTC appreciates the assistance of the Office of the State Attorney for the Seventh Judicial District of Florida; the
Florida Office of Financial Regulation; the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Florida; the North Carolina
Department of the Secretary of State, Securities Division; the Sherriff's Department, Brunswick County, North Carolina;
and the City of Myrtle North Myrtle Beach, Department of Public Safety.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this action are Timothy J. Mulreany, George Malas, and Paul
Hayeck.

CFTCâs Commodity Pool Fraud Advisory

The CFTC has issued several customer protection Fraud Advisories that provide the warning signs of fraud, including the
Commodity Pool Fraud Advisory, which warns customers about a type of fraud that involves individuals and firms, often
unregistered, offering investments in commodity pools.

Customers can report suspicious activities or information, such as possible violations of commodity trading laws, to the
CFTC Division of Enforcement via a Toll-Free Hotline 866-FON-CFTC (866-366-2382) or file a tip or complaint online.

Defendants,

 

 

COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,
CIVIL MONETARY PENALTIES, AND OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF

The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCFTCâ or âCommissionâ), by and
through its attorneys, hereby alleges as follows:

I. INTRODUCTION

1. During Fall 2011, Kraft Foods Group, Inc. and MondelÃ©z Global LLC
(collectively âDefendantsâ or âKraftââ), by and through the acts of certain its officers, agents or
employees, engaged in a manipulative and deceptive scheme to manipulate or attempt to
manipulate the prices of the December 2011 wheat futures contract traded on the Chicago Board
of Trade (âCBOTâ) and cash wheat. At the same time, Kraft also held wheat futures positions in
excess of speculative position limits established by the Commission.

2. In addition, beginning in at least 2009 and continuing through January 2014,
Kraft, by and through the acts of certain its officers, agents or employees, engaged in
noncompetitive trades by trading both sides of an exchange-for-physical (âEFPâ) CBOT wheat

contract at least five times per year.
Case: 1:15-cv-02881 Document #: 1 Filed: 04/01/15 Page 2 of 23 PagelD #:2

3. By engaging in this conduct and the conduct further described herein, Kraft has
engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in acts and practices that violate the Commodity
Exchange Act (the âActâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1 et seg. (2012), and Commission Regulations
(âRegulationsâ) promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1 et seg. (2014). Specifically, by using a
deceptive or manipulative device in connection with the December 2011 wheat futures contract
and cash wheat, Kraft violated Sections 6(c)(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 9(1) (2012), and
Regulation 180.1, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 180.1 (2014). In addition, by manipulating and attempting to
manipulate the prices of the December 2011 wheat futures contract and cash wheat, Kraft
violated Sections 6(c)(3) and 9(a)(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 9(1) and 13(a)(2) (2012), and
Regulation 180.2, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 180.2 (2014). Further, by holding wheat futures positions in
excess of Commission speculative position limits set forth in Regulation 150.2, 17 C.F.R.

Â§ 150.2 and CBOT speculative position limits, Kraft violated Sections 4a(b) and (e) of the Act,
7 U.S.C. Â§ 6a(b) and (e) (2012). Finally, by engaging in wash sales by trading both sides of EFP
contracts, Kraft violated Section 4c(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6c(a) (2012), and Regulation
1.38(a), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.38(a) (2014).

4, Accordingly, the CFTC brings this action pursuant to Section 6c of the Act,

7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2012), to enjoin Kraftâs unlawful acts and practices and to compel its
compliance with the Act and Regulations. The CFTC also seeks civil monetary penalties and
remedial ancillary relief, including disgorgement, pre- and post-judgment interest, and such other

equitable relief as this Court may deem necessary and appropriate.

II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

5. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 6c(a) of the Act,

7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(a) (2012), which authorizes the CFTC to seek injunctive relief against any
Case: 1:15-cv-02881 Document #: 1 Filed: 04/01/15 Page 3 of 23 PagelD #:3

person whenever it appears that such person has engaged, is engaging, or 1s about to engage in
any act or practice that violates any provision of the Act or any rule, regulation, or order
promulgated thereunder.

6. Venue properly lies with this Court pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act,
7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(e) (2012), because Kraft is located and transacts business in this District, and
the acts and practices in violation of the Act have occurred, are occurring, or are about to occur
within this District, among other places.

Hil. PARTIES

7. Plaintiff U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an independent

American snack food business. The operative spin-off agreements apportion liability between

Kraft Foods Group, Inc. and MondelÃ©z International, Inc.

IV. FACTS
A. Background

11. Kraft is one of the largest domestic end users of #2 Soft Red Winter Wheat, which
is the variety of wheat deliverable against the CBOT wheat futures contract. Kraft consumes
approximately 30 million bushels of wheat per year (or roughly 2.5 million bushels per month)
for use in production of products like Oreo, Chips Ahoy!, Ritz, Triscuit, and Wheat Thins.
Ninety percent of the wheat used by Kraft is milled into flour at Kraftâs Toledo, Ohio Flour Mill
(the âMillâ) on the Maumee River, which flows into Maumee Bay, Lake Erie.

12. In order to produce usable flour, Kraft requires wheat for milling that meets
certain specifications for baking and human consumption. These specifications include the
permissible numbers of insect damaged kernels and maximum allowable levels of vomitoxin (a
mycotoxin that may be produced in wheat infected by Fusarium head blight or scab). According
to U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidance, finished baked goods must have a vomitoxin
level below one part per million. Normal wheat milling processes and cleaning technologies can
substantially reduce vomitoxin levels in finished flour by approximately one-half from the level
in unprocessed wheat. Vomitoxin levels in finished flour also can be reduced in the milling
process by blending in wheat possessing lower vomitoxim levels.

13. Kraft will also consider certain baking characteristics of wheat, including gluten
content and solvent retention levels, to ensure that it is able to produce flour that will meet its

baking needs.
Case: 1:15-cv-02881 Document #: 1 Filed: 04/01/15 Page 5 of 23 PagelD #:5

14. Kraft typically purchases wheat on a daily basis throughout the year, seeking to
ensure that it always has sufficient supply for the Mill. Kraft has the capacity to store 5 million
bushels of unprocessed wheat at the Mill, and it strives to maintain two monthsâ supply in its
inventory.

15. Kraft has two primary options for obtaining the wheat it requires. First, it can
purchase wheat directly from a grain producer or wholesaler in the cash market. When Kraft
sources through the cash market, it can negotiate the wheat specifications in the contracts to
ensure that the quality of wheat meets its requirements. For example, in its contracts, Kraft
regularly specifies a maximum vomitoxin level of 2 parts per million and maximum insect
damaged kernels of 3 per 100 grams.

16. When Kraft purchases wheat in the cash market, it can also negotiate the delivery
location and process. Because of the location of the Mill, when it purchases in the cash market,
Kraft will ordinarily source wheat from the Toledo region, which includes Ohio, Indiana,
Michigan, and Ontario, and have it delivered to the Mill by rail or truck. Warehouses and
shipping stations outside the Toledo region, including those down the Mississippi River, are not
required to transport wheat to Toledo by rail or truck. Consequently, it is not advantageous for
Kraft to take delivery of wheat down the Mississippi River, as Kraft would have to arrange for
the wheat to be barged to a location where it could be transferred to rail, and then shipped to the
Mill, significantly increasing the cost to Kraft. It is not possible to barge wheat directly from
locations down the Mississippi River to the Mill.

17. Kraftâs second primary option for sourcing wheat is to purchase wheat futures
contracts sold on the CBOT. The CBOT is a registered entity as defined in Section 1a(40) of the

Act and is one of four designated contract markets for trading futures contracts pursuant to
Case: 1:15-cv-02881 Document #: 1 Filed: 04/01/15 Page 6 of 23 PagelD #:6

Section 5 of the Act that make up the CME Group, Inc. (âCMEâ). The CBOT maintains rules
applicable to futures trading of wheat and the CME conducts surveillance and compliance
activities related to CBOT trading.

18. A futures contract is a standardized agreement between two parties to purchase or
sell a predetermined quantity of a commodity during a future month, at a price that is determined
at the initiation of the contract. The trader who purchases the commodity is said to have a âlong
position,â while the trader who sells the commodity is said to have a âshort position.â Futures
contracts may be settled by delivery of the actual commodity at the conclusion of the contract or
âoffsetâ by entering an equal and opposite trade, effectively eliminating the original position.

19. Chapter 14 of the CBOT Rules governs the specifications for and trading of wheat
futures. A wheat futures contract consists of 5,000 bushels of wheat, subject to further quality
specifications. (CBOT Rules 14102.B, 14104). The minimum price fluctuation for trading
wheat futures is 4 cent per bushel, which is equivalent to $12.50 per futures contract, including
spreads. (CBOT Rule 14102.C.) CBOT wheat futures contracts are traded for delivery during
five different contract months each calendar year: March, May, July, September, and December.
(CBOT Rule 14102) Delivery on the CBOT wheat contract is effected when the seller of the
futures contract tenders a âshipping certificateâ (which represents an interest in wheat for load-
out from a CBOT-approved delivery facility) to the buyer of the futures contract. (See generally
CBOT Rules 14105-14110) Shipping certificates may also be bought and sold between traders
or exchanged for futures positions.

20. Wheat acquired via the futures market is typically of a lower quality than that
sourced in the cash market. For example, during the time period covered by this Complaint

CBOT rules specified that deliverable wheat could have vomitoxin levels of up to 4 parts per
Case: 1:15-cv-02881 Document #: 1 Filed: 04/01/15 Page 7 of 23 PagelD #:7

million (CBOT Rule 14104); the deliverable wheat actually available rarely had levels below
two parts per million.

21. Further, parties who take delivery of CBOT wheat do not have the ability to
specify delivery location or load out process, nor do they even know the delivery location for the
contracts they have purchased until they receive shipping certificates.

22. Because of the inability to control wheat quality or delivery location, Kraft rarely
takes delivery of wheat via the CBOT delivery process. Indeed, Kraft typically specifies in its
cash market contracts that it will not accept wheat registered for delivery under CBOT contracts
because such wheat is typically blended down by mixing lower quality product so that the
overall mixture will barely meet the minimum CBOT requirements.

23. Prior to Fall 2011, Kraft last took delivery of wheat via the CBOT delivery
process in 2002. Instead of taking delivery of CBOT wheat, Kraft normally uses the futures
markets to hedge its cash wheat purchases, taking long futures positions that roughly correlate
with its actual wheat needs and then offsetting these positions as it acquires physical wheat in the
cash market.

B. Kraft Manipulated or Attempted to Manipulate
the Wheat Markets During Fall 2011

24. In late Summer 2011, cash wheat prices for #2 Soft Red Winter Wheat at Toledo,
Ohio had risen from a price of $5.74 per bushel on June 30, 2011 to $7.72 per bushel on
August 26, 2011. Over the same time, the price of December 2011 CBOT wheat futures
increased from $6.57% to $7.97. Even though cash wheat prices were rising, there was sufficient
wheat available in the cash wheat market for Kraft to purchase and deliver to the Mill to satisfy

Kraftâs needs.
Case: 1:15-cv-02881 Document #: 1 Filed: 04/01/15 Page 8 of 23 PagelD #:8

25. In response to these elevated cash prices, however, Kraft deviated from its
practice of using the futures markets solely to hedge its cash wheat purchases. Kraft wheat
procurement staff developed, and Kraft senior management approved, a strategy to use its status
as a commercial hedger to acquire a huge long position in December 2011 wheat futures in order
to induce sellers to believe that Kraft would take delivery, load out, and use that wheat in its
Mill. In developing the strategy, Kraft, acting through certain of its procurement staff and
certain senior management, intended that the futures market would react to its enormous long
position by increasing the price of the December 2011 futures contract while reducing the
differential between the December futures price and the price of the cash market wheat. Kraft
executed its plan, and the market reacted as Kraft expected, yielding Kraft more than $5.4
million in futures trading profits and savings from its strategy.

26. In fact, Kraft, acting through its procurement staff, acquired its December 2011
long position without any intention of loading out, delivering, and using the majority of the
CBOT wheat it stood to acquire.

27. Kraft, acting through its procurement staff, executed a âtrial runâ of this strategy
in September 2011, taking delivery of 250,000 bushels of CBOT wheat, which constituted fifty
total certificates. Upon standing for delivery, thirty-one of the fifty certificates that Kraft
received in September 2011 were for wheat located at locations on the Mississippi River that
were more than 650 miles from the Mill and would have required at least two changes in mode
of transport and shipment in the opposite direction of the commercial flow of wheat to bring to
the Mill. This meant that Kraft could not use barges to transport the wheat directly to the Mill

and, due to exchange rules, Kraft could not require that the wheat be loaded directly on to rail
Case: 1:15-cv-02881 Document #: 1 Filed: 04/01/15 Page 9 of 23 PagelD #:9

transport. As a result of this test involving just fifty certificates, Kraft knew that it could not rely
upon taking delivery of CBOT wheat to source wheat easily transportable to the Mill.

28. At around the same time, Kraft submitted a public comment to the Commission in
response to a proposed change to CBOT rules removing language requiring wheat delivery
facilities to be connected to railroad service. Kraftâs comment requested that the language not be
removed. Kraftâs position was not adopted.

29. Nevertheless, in October 2011, Kraft wheat procurement staff proposed to Kraft
senior management that Kraft adopt a strategy of buying $90 million of December 2011 wheat
futures in early December 2011 in order to depress the price of wheat in the cash market and
inflate the futures price of wheat.

30. In an October 20, 2011 email to Kraftâs Chief Financial Officer and other senior
management, the Kraft Senior Director Global Procurement, explained the strategy as follows:

Given our proposal to âtake physical delivery in Decâ of 15 mm bushels at 50 cents per
bushel below the commercially offered price results in the savings of $7mm+.

In addition, there is a key market dynamic that is important to understand: Once the
market sees that Kraft is âstoppingâ December wheat, we anticipate the futures
curve will begin to flatten, reducing the profitability of wheat storage, thereby
reducing the commercial wheat basis to Kraft. We will then have the option of
redelivering the wheat acquired through the futures market. This will then quickly
reverse the negative cash flow impact.
(emphasis added).
31. When considering the Kraft procurement staff's $90 million December 2011
wheat futures proposal, Kraft senior management required that the futures position could not
exceed $50 million by the end of December. Kraft procurement staff agreed to sell at least $40

million of the proposed $90 million position by the end of the month. Kraft senior management

then approved the procurement staff proposal for Kraft to buy $90 million of December 2011
Case: 1:15-cv-02881 Document #: 1 Filed: 04/01/15 Page 10 of 23 PagelD #:10

wheat futures, knowing that procurement staff would sell $40 million of the position before the
end of the month.

32. Kraft did not have a bona fide commercial need for $90 million of wheat â which
would amount to approximately 15 million bushels, or a six-month supply for the Mill â in
December 2011. Kraft had never possessed that quantity of wheat, and had no ability to store
that quantity of wheat within its own facilities. Indeed, Kraft did not even have a bona fide
commercial need for or present ability to store $50 million of wheat (its proposed $90 million
position net of selling $40 million) â which would amount to more than an additional three
monthsâ supply for the Mill.

33. As of November 2011, Kraft already possessed more than 4.2 million bushels of
wheat in storage at the Mill, which represented more than 80% of its storage capacity. If Kraft
were to have taken delivery of 15 million bushels of wheat â an amount equivalent to
approximately 3,000 certificates â in December 2011, it would have had to locate additional
storage and pay additional costs of approximately five cents per bushel for nearly all of the wheat
for up to six months. In addition, in order to use CBOT wheat, Kraft would have had to buy â
and store â yet additional higher-quality cash wheat to blend with the lower-quality CBOT wheat
so as to ensure the wheat would meet its baking specifications. Thus, Kraft would have needed
to locate and pay for storage of far in excess of 15 million bushels.

34. Kraft never intended to take delivery of 15 million bushels of wheat, but instead
desired to make the market believe that it would take delivery, load out, and store that wheat for
use in the Mill. Kraft intended for the market to react to its long position by lowering the price

of cash wheat available in the Toledo area, which would allow Kraft to obtain wheat in the cash

10
Case: 1:15-cv-02881 Document #: 1 Filed: 04/01/15 Page 11 of 23 PagelD #:11

market at more favorable prices. Kraft also intended to profit from the positions it held in
December and March wheat futures by narrowing the spread between the two contracts.

35. Kraft procurement employees, including the Senior Director Global Procurement
and the Associate Director of Procurement, executed the strategy, ultimately accumulating 3150
long CBOT December 2011 wheat futures contracts by November 29, 2011, the first day of the
delivery period, equivalent to 15.75 million bushels or approximately $93.5 million of wheat. As
of December 7, 2011, Kraftâs spot month wheat position constituted 87% percent of the CBOT
December 2011 wheat futures open interest.

36. In a second email to Kraft senior management on December 2, 2011 email, the
Kraft Senior Director Global Procurement confirmed that the strategy was working as planned:

As you may recall, we established a long Dec Wheat/Short March Wheat spread at 35

cents (Mar premium to Dec) for the purpose of taking delivery of CME wheat,

representing a $7MM+ saving over commercially sourced wheat. Since Monday we have

âstoppedâ 2.2MM bushels of wheat at a cost of $13.2MM. As expected, the Dec/Mar

spread has narrowed to app|roximately| 11 cents resulting in a marked to market

gain of $3.6MM on our open spread position. Meanwhile, with the narrowing
spread, the cash wheat basis has declined from +80 cents to +50 cents over Dec
futures. As we begin purchasing this cheaper basis commercial wheat, we will unwind
the existing spread position. If all goes according to plan, we will still save $7MM on the
commercial cost of wheat vs where it was a few weeks ago as well as make $2-3MM on
reversing out of the Dec/Mar wheat spread.

(emphasis added).

37. Upon standing for delivery of CBOT December 2011 wheat contracts, the
shipping certificates that Kraft received were all for wheat located in warehouses on the
Mississippi River, which are outside the Toledo region and are not required to transport wheat to
Toledo by rail. To take delivery, Kraft had to arrange for the wheat to be barged to a location

where it could be transferred to rail, and then shipped to the Mill. These shipping arrangements

significantly increased Kraftâs costs by approximately $1.21 per bushel.

1]
Case: 1:15-cv-02881 Document #: 1 Filed: 04/01/15 Page 12 of 23 PagelD #:12

38. Ultimately, Kraft took delivery of 1320 shipping certificates for December 2011
CBOT wheat, or a total of 6.6 million bushels. It loaded out just 660,000 bushels (132 contracts)
of that wheat, which was less than 5% of the wheat position it carried in early December and
equivalent to approximately $4 million worth of wheat. After prices in the cash market declined,
Kraft resold 1188 of its December 2011 shipping certificates for $35,725,074.

39. | On December 9, Kraft offset all of its 826 remaining long futures contracts in the
market (80% of the open interest), which amounted to 78.3% of the trading volume that day.
Kraft did not purchase a similar quantity of wheat in the cash market, which would be expected
if it had really needed that wheat for its operations.

AO. Kraftâs actions proximately caused cash wheat prices in Toledo to decline and the
December 2011/March 2012 wheat futures spread to narrow, which was favorable to Kraft. In
particular, December 11 wheat futures prices increased from $5.75 as of November 28, 2011 to
$6.12 as of December 2, 2011. Cash wheat prices in Toledo declined from $6.16 per bushel as
of December 2, 2011 to $5.86 per bushel as of December 9, 2011. As a result of these price
shifts, Kraft earned over $5.4 million in profits.

C. Kraft Violated Speculative Position Limits

Al. During the relevant time, the Commission specified the position limit levels for
wheat futures. 70 Fed.Reg. 24705, 24707, Revision of Federal Speculative Position Limits
(CFTC May 11, 2005). It published those levels in Commission Regulation 150.2, 17 C.F.R.

Â§ 150.2 (2011), which provided that no person may hold or control a net long or net short
position for the purchase or sale of wheat for future delivery traded on the CBOT in excess of
600 contracts in the spot month, or in excess of 5,000 contracts for any single contract month or

6,500 contracts for all months combined. These position limits are intended to protect the

12
Case: 1:15-cv-02881 Document #: 1 Filed: 04/01/15 Page 13 of 23 PagelD #:13

futures market from excessive speculation that could cause unreasonable or unwarranted price
fluctuations.

42. Consistent with the Commission, the CBOT adopted speculative position limits
for CBOT wheat futures at the Commission-specified levels. The CBOT position limit scheme
for wheat futures included a prohibition against trading in excess of position limits, as set forth in
CBOT Rule 14102.E. (âPosition Limits, Exemptions, Position Accountability and Reportable
Levelsâ), which referenced harmonized CME/CBOT Rule 559 (âPositon Limits and
Exemptionsâ), which, in turn, provided that the position limit levels applicable to those contracts
with position limits are set forth in the âPosition Limit, Position Accountability and Reportable
Level Tableâ (âTableâ) in the Interpretations Section at the end of Chapter 5 of the exchange
rules. During the relevant time, the Table identified a wheat futures spot month level of 600
contracts in the spot month, or in excess of 5,000 contracts for any single contract month or
6,500 contracts for all months combined.

43. Traders who are bona fide hedgers â such as producers or end-users of particular
commodities, like Kraft â can apply for exemptions to speculative position limits based on a
demonstration of bona fide hedging needs. Requests for hedge exemptions from exchange limits
must be submitted to the CME, which reviews the requests and, if approved, issues a letter
setting out the specific additional limit it has approved for the entity. Hedge exemptions are
valid for one calendar year and are renewable only through the submission of another application
to the CME.

44. At all times relevant to this Complaint, the CBOT speculative position limit for
wheat futures contracts was 600 contracts during the spot month. Spot month is defined as

commencing at the close of business on the business day prior to the first notice day â the day

13
Case: 1:15-cv-02881 Document #: 1 Filed: 04/01/15 Page 14 of 23 PagelD #:14

after which the purchaser of a futures contract may be required to take physical delivery â for
any delivery month and terminating at the end of the delivery period. Regulation 151.3,

17 C.F.R. Â§ 151.3 (2011). For the December 2011 wheat contract, the spot month period began
on November 29, 2011.

A5. | Asacommercial end user of flour, Kraft is eligible to seek a hedge exemption to
cover its wheat needs. In or about October 2010, Kraft submitted such an application to the
CME. On October 22, 2010, it received an exemption approval letter, permitting it to maintain
wheat positions in excess of the speculative position limit, effectrve December 1, 2010. The
exemption approval letter noted that âpositions in the last five days of trading of any futures
contract may not exceed Kraft Foods, Inc.âs unfilled anticipated requirements of the same cash
commodity for that month and the next succeeding month.â

46. The exemption approval specifically noted that exemptions must be renewed on
an annual basis and that any application by Kraft to renew its exemption must be submitted to
the CME by no later than December 1, 2011.

A7. Kraft did not submit a request for renewal of its hedge exemption until
December 28, 2011. Consequently, beginning on December 2, Kraft no longer had a CME
hedge exemption for the December 2011 wheat contract and it was bound by the 600 contract
speculative position limit in that commodity. Kraft also did not request a hedge exemption with
the Commission for December 2011.

A8. Kraft did not have a bona fide commercial need for the long futures position that

it acquired in December 2011 wheat.

14
Case: 1:15-cv-02881 Document #: 1 Filed: 04/01/15 Page 15 of 23 PagelD #:15

49, Kraft held long positions in December 2011 wheat that exceeded the mandated
speculative position limit for wheat on December 2, 5, 6, 7 and 8 by 2,110, 2106, 1,666, 1,226
and 226 contracts respectively.

50. Kraft also accepted delivery of 1320 December wheat futures contracts between
November 30, 2011 and December 7, 2011.

D. Kraft Engaged in Fictitious EFP Transactions

51. Kraft maintains several trading accounts in which it does wheat futures
transactions for both long and short hedging purposes. Kraftâs internal computer software cannot
distinguish between long and short positions for the same contract month within the same
account, so Kraftâs practice has been to place its long wheat futures position in one account and
its short wheat futures position in a second account to keep track of them.

52. Beginning in or about 2003 and continuing through January 2014, prior to each of
the five annual delivery periods for CBOT wheat, Kraft conducted an off-exchange transaction
between the two Kraft accounts carrying the long and short positions whereby Kraftâs short
position was offset by its long position. Kraftâs finance department determined the price level at
which each transaction would be done and communicated that information to wheat procurement
staff who directed Kraftâs clearing firm to execute the transaction. Each of the transactions was
cleared through the CME as an EFP.

53. Pursuant to Regulation 1.38(a), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.38(a), noncompetitive, off-
exchange futures trades are permitted only when they are executed in accordance with the rules
of the relevant exchange.

54. CME Rule 538 and CBOT Rule 538 permit âExchanges for Related Positionsâ â
of which EFPs are a sub-set â under certain conditions. EFPs are permissible only if they are

between two independent parties and involve a privately negotiated and simultaneous exchange

15
Case: 1:15-cv-02881 Document #: 1 Filed: 04/01/15 Page 16 of 23 PagelD #:16

of a futures position for a corresponding and offsetting cash physical position. EFPs must be
cleared and reported to the appropriate exchange and the parties must prepare proper
documentation for both parts of the transaction, including the same documentation that would
accompany any other sale of a physical commodity.

55. Kraft controlled both trading accounts involved in these EFP transactions. Kraft
also did not actually transfer physical wheat in connection with any of the EFP transactions, nor
did it create any of the documentation that ordinarily accompanies the sale of a physical
commodity. The only documentation for these EFP transactions are the notations of the transfer
of the futures position between accounts in Kraftâs futures account statements and internal
records. Because they did not involve the actual transfer of physical wheat between two

independent parties, Kraftâs EFPs were impermissible and violated Regulation 1.38.

V. VIOLATIONS OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT

COUNT I

attempted to engage in any act, practice or course of business which operated or would operate
as a fraud or deceit upon any person, in violation of Section 6(c)(1) of the Act and Regulation

60. Because the actions of Kraftâs wheat procurement staff occurred within the scope
of their employment, office, or agency with Kraft, Kraft is liable as a principal for their
violations of Section 6(c)(1) and Regulation 180.1 pursuant to Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act,

7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(a)(1)(B), and Regulation 1.2, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.2 (2014).

of a commodity in interstate commerce or for future delivery on or subject to the rules of any
registered entity, in violation of Sections 6(c)(3) and 9(a)(2) of the Act and Regulation 180.2.

violations of Sections 6(c)(3) and 9(a)(2) of the Act and Regulation 180.2 pursuant to Section

COUNT I

Violations of Section 4a(b) and (e) of the Act, and Regulation 150.2:
Speculative Position Limits Violation

69. Paragraphs | through 55 are realleged and incorporated herein by reference.

70. Section 4a(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6a(a), authorizes the Commission to fix such
limits on the positions which can be held on futures contracts. Section 4a(b)(2) of the Act
prohibits any person directly or indirectly to control a net long or net short position in any

commodity in excess of any position limit fixed by the Commission. Pursuant to this authority,

18
Case: 1:15-cv-02881 Document #: 1 Filed: 04/01/15 Page 19 of 23 PagelD #:19

the Commission enacted Regulation 150.2, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 150.2 (2011), which, among other things,
sets speculative position limits in wheat futures contracts.

71. Section 4a(e) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6a(e), makes it unlawful for any individual to
violate a rule of a contract market or board of trade setting limits on the net number of contracts
that may be possessed or controlled by one person or entity if such rule was approved by the
Commission.

72. During the time period covered by this Complaint, the speculative position limit
set by the Commission in Regulation 150.2 and by the CME in CBOT Rule 559 for CBOT wheat
futures contracts was 600 contracts during the spot month.

73. By exceeding the limit fixed by Commission Regulation 150.2 and the CBOT
rules on December 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8, 2011, Kraft violated Section 4a(b) and (e) of the Act and
Regulation 150.2, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 150.2 (2011).

74. Each date on which Kraft exceeded the speculative position limit for December
2011 wheat constitutes a separate and distinct violation of Section 4a(b) and (e) of the Act and
Regulation 150.2.

75. The acts, omissions, and failures of Kraftâs employees, officers and agents set
forth in paragraphs 1 through 54, above, occurred within the scope of the employeesâ, officersâ
and agentsâ employment, office, or agency with Kraft. Therefore, Kraft is liable for its
employeesâ, officersâ and agentsâ acts, omissions, and failures constituting violations of Section
4a(b) and (e) of the Act, pursuant to Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act.

COUNT IV

Violations of Sections 4c(a)(1) and (2) of the Act and Regulation 1.38(a):
Wash Sales, Fictitious Sales and Noncompetitive Trading

76. Paragraphs | through 55 are realleged and incorporated herein by reference.

19
Case: 1:15-cv-02881 Document #: 1 Filed: 04/01/15 Page 20 of 23 PagelD #:20

77. Sections 4c(a)(1) and (2) of the Act, read together, provide, in relevant part, âIt
shall be unlawful for any person to offer to enter into, enter into, or confirm the execution of a
transaction .. . involving the purchase or sale of any commodity for future delivery . . . that
(A)(i) is, is of the character of, or is commonly known to the trade as, a âwash saleâ or .. . (11) is a
fictitious sale; or (B) is used to cause any price to be reported, registered or recorded that is not a
true and bona fide price.â 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6c(a)(1) and (2).

78. Commission Regulation 1.38(a) provides, in relevant part:

Competitive execution required; exceptions. All purchases and sales of any

commodity for future delivery ... on or subject to the rules of a contract market

shall be executed openly and competitively by open outcry or posting of bids and

offers or by other equally open and competitive methods . . . during the regular

hours prescribed by the contract market for trading in such commodity .. .

Provided, however, That this requirement shall not apply to transactions which

are executed noncompetitively in accordance with the written rules of the contract

market which have been submitted to and approved by the Commission,

specifically providing for the noncompetitive execution of such transactions.

79. CME Rule 538 and CBOT Rule 538 allow noncompetitive EFP transactions only
when, among other things, the transactions involve two independent parties, result in the actual
transfer of the cash commodity, and are supported by proper documentation.

80. The off-exchange transactions in which Kraft off-set short and long positions in
its own accounts, and which Kraft reported to the CME as EFPs, were not done in accordance
with the written rules regarding EFPs of the CME and CBOT because the two sides of the EFP
transactions were not independent parties given that Kraft set the price of the transactions, the
transactions did not transfer the cash commodity, and Kraft failed to maintain proper

documentation of the transactions. Additionally, by engaging in these EFP transactions that

were equal and offsetting in price Kraft avoided price competition and any market risk.

20
Case: 1:15-cv-02881 Document #: 1 Filed: 04/01/15 Page 21 of 23 PagelD #:21

Accordingly, these transactions constituted âwash salesâ âfictitious salesâ and noncompetitive
trades in violation of Sections 4c(a)(1) and (2) of the Act and Regulation 1.38.

81. Section 4c(a) of the Act also makes it unlawful to offer to enter into, enter into, or
confirm the execution of a commodity futures transaction that âis used to cause any price to be
reported, registered, or recorded that is not a true and bona fide price.â 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6c(a) (2012).
Where a transaction is non-bona fide in violation of Regulation 1.38(a), the price reported for
that transaction is also non-bona fide.

82. By entering into futures trades noncompetitively, in violation of Section 4c(a) of
the Act and Regulation 1.38(a), and reporting those transactions to the CME or CBOT, Kraft also
caused non-bona fide prices to be reported or recorded in violation of Section 4c(a)

83. Each instance in which Kraft engaged in a wash sale, fictitious sale or non-
competitive trade, and each instance where Kraft caused non-bona fide prices to be reported or
recorded as described above from 2009 through January 2014 constitutes a separate and distinct
violation of Sections 4c(a)(1) and (2) of the Act and Regulation 1.38.

84. The acts, omissions, and failures of Kraftâs employees, officers and agents set
forth in paragraphs 1 through 54, above, occurred within the scope of the employeesâ, officersâ
and agentsâ employment, office, or agency with Kraft. Therefore, Kraft is liable for its
employeesâ, officersâ and agentsâ acts, omissions, and failures constituting violations of Section
Ac(a) of the Act, pursuant to Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, and Regulation 1.38.

VI. RELIEF REQUESTED

Â§Â§ 1.38(a), 150.2, 180.1, and 180.2 (2014);

penalty in the amount of not more than the greater of: (1) triple the monetary gain to Kraft for

CFTC Charges Kraft Foods Group, Inc. and Mondelez Global LLC with Manipulation of
Wheat Futures and Cash Wheat Prices

CFIC also charges violations of position limits and noncompetitive
trading

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced the filing of a civil
enforcement Complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against Kraft Foods Group, Inc. and
Mondelez Global LLC, headquartered in Northfield and Deerfield, Illinois, respectively, for manipulation and attempted
manipulation of the prices of cash wheat and wheat futures. The Complaint also alleges that Kraft and MondelÃ©z violated
speculative position limits by holding wheat futures positions in excess of speculative position limits established by the
CFTC and the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) without a valid hedge exemption or a bona fide hedging need, and engaged
in numerous noncompetitive trades in CBOT wheat.

Aitan Goelman, the CFTCâs Director of Enforcement, stated: âThis case goes to the core of the CFTCâs mission: protecting
market participants and the public from manipulation and abusive practices that undermine the integrity of the
derivatives markets. A market participant who is not happy with cash prices available to it may not resort to manipulative
trading strategies in an attempt to artificially lower that price.â

According to the CFTC Complaint, in response to high cash wheat prices in late Summer 2011, Kraft and MondelÃ©z
developed, approved, and executed in early December 2011 a strategy to buy $90 million of December 2011 wheat
futures, which amounted to a six-month supply of wheat. The CFTC Complaint alleges that Kraft and MondelÃ©z never
intended to take delivery of this wheat and instead executed this strategy expecting that the market would react to their
enormous long position by lowering cash wheat prices and strengthening the spread between December 2011 wheat and
March 2012 wheat futures. Those price shifts did occur and, according to the CFTC Complaint, Kraft and MondelÃ©z earned
over $5.4 million in profits.

The CFTC Complaint also alleges that on five dates in early December 2011, Kraft and MondelÃ©z held long positions in
December 2011 wheat that exceeded the CBOTâs 600-contract speculative spot month position limit by as much as 2,110
contracts without having a valid hedge exemption in place or a bona fide need for that quantity of wheat.

Finally, the CFTC Complaint alleges that beginning in or about 2003 and continuing through January 2014, prior to each
of the five annual delivery periods for CBOT wheat, Kraft and MondelÃ©z conducted off-exchange futures transactions
between two separate corporate trading accounts that did not comply with exchange rules for noncompetitive, off-
exchange futures trades.

In its continuing litigation against Kraft and MondelÃ©z, the CFTC seeks a permanent injunction from future violations of
federal commodities laws, disgorgement, and civil monetary penalties.

The CFTC staff members responsible for this case are Division of Enforcement staff Robert Howell, Jennifer E. Smiley,
Joseph Patrick, Susan Gradman, Scott Williamson, and Rosemary Hollinger, and Division of Market Oversight staff David
Amato, Gene Kunda, and Jerry Lavin.

of trading in off-exchange agreements, contracts, or transactions in foreign currency (âforexâ) on
a leveraged or margined basis. The Complaint also alleged that Defendants misappropriated
approximately $1.7 million of pool participantsâ funds and that RFF along with other Relief

KGW Real Estate (âKGW Real Estateâ) (collectively âRelief Defendantsâ) received pool

II. FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

The court, being fully advised in the premises, finds that there is good cause for the entry
of this Consent Order and that there is no just reason for delay. The court therefore directs the
entry of the following Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, permanent injunction, and equitable
relief pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2012), as set forth herein.

THE PARTIES AGREE AND THE COURT HEREBY FINDS:
A. Findings of Fact
1. The Parties To This Consent Order

14. Plaintiff U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an independent
federal regulatory agency that is charged by Congress with administering and enforcing the Act,
7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1 ef seq. (2012), and the Commission Regulations promulgated thereunder,

17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1.1 ef seg. (2013).

15. Defendant RFF GP, LLC is a Texas company that was formed on or about July

20, 2011. RFF GP is RFFâs general partner. RFF GP has never been registered with the

Commission in any capacity.
Case 4:13-cv-00382-RAS-DDB Document 149 Filed 03/30/15 Page 6 of 24 PagelD #: 2060

16. Defendant KGW Capital Management, LLC is a Texas company that was
formed on or about July 25, 2007. KGW Capita! purported to be âone of the worldâs leading
private investment firmsâ that offered investments in forex through RFF among other
investments. KGW Capital has never been registered with the Commission in any capacity.

17. Defendant Kevin G. White is the manager and director of RFF GP and the
president and CEO of KGW Capital. White was previously registered with the Commission as
an associated person (âAPâ) at Lehman Brothers Inc. (later Shearson Lehman Brothers) from
1981 to 1987, and as an AP at EF Hutton and Company Inc. (later Shearson Lehman Hutton)
from 1987 to 1988.

2. Defendantsâ Misappropriation of Pool Participantsâ Funds

18. During the Relevant Period, pool participants provided Defendants with
approximately $7.4 millionâ either through bank wire transfers to RFFâs bank accounts, which
were controlled by White, or through checks made payable to RFF for purposes of trading forex.
White in turn transferred some of these pool participant funds to his personal bank accounts,
while using other pool participantsâ funds for personal and business expenses. Additionally,
White transferred funds to Relief Defendants, Meridian Propane and KGW Real Estate, which
were entities controlled by White and that had nothing to do with forex trading.

19. Of the approximately $7.4 million invested with RFF during the Relevant Period,
Defendants misappropriated approximately $1.7 million. White used the misappropriated funds
for personal expenses, including a gym membership, retail purchases, meals, travel, a dog

training service, vehicle maintenance, and alimony payments, as well as business expenses

 

? After gaining access to RFFâs records, the Commission and court-appointed receiver

determined that the amount pool participants provided to Defendants is approximately $1.6
million more than the $5.8 million estimated in the Complaint and SRO.

including furniture, electronic equipment, and marketing services. In essence, White treated
RFFâs bank accounts as his personal bank account.

20. Defendants concealed their misappropriation of pool participantsâ funds from
prospective pool participants by claiming in their promotional materials that they charged an
âindustry standardâ 2% annual management fee and a 20% annual performance fee, which was
purportedly based on profits. Further, White told prospective pool participants that Defendants
would not be paid unless RFF was profitable. Contrary to Defendantsâ representations, however,
Whiteâs personal expenditures of pool participantsâ funds and those poo! participantsâ funds
transferred to other businesses controlled by him far exceeded the purported 2% annual
management fee. Moreover, Whiteâs misappropriation of pool participantsâ funds continued
despite RFFâs unprofitability.

3. Defendantsâ Material Misrepresentations and Omissions

21. During the Relevant Period, Defendants made a litany of material
misrepresentations that misstated RFFâs profitability and Whiteâs previous brokerage experience,
and material omissions that failed to disclose Defendantsâ misappropriation of pool participantsâ
funds. Defendants made these misrepresentations and omissions through written promotional
materials used to solicit prospective pool participants by depicting purported profitable trading
results that were posted on Defendantsâ two websites, www.revelationforex.com and
www.kgweapital.com. Additionally, White used these same misleading materials to solicit
prospective pool participants at the May 2013 âMoneyShowâ trade show event in Las Vegas,
Nevada.

22. In promotional material entitled âHistorical Performanceâ posted on their

websites and distributed by White at the âMoneyShow,â Defendants claimed positive annualized
Case 4:13-cv-00382-RAS-DDB Document 149 Filed 03/30/15 Page 8 of 24 PagelD #: 2062

returns for RFF ranging from 24.01% to 59.73% for each year between 2009 and 2012. These
claims were false because Defendants did not begin trading forex until September 2011, and
Defendantsâ performance in trading forex on behalf of RFF resulted in losses, not positive
returns. Specifically, Defendants suffered successive losses of $34,000 in 2011 and $933,000 in
2012, for a cumulative loss of approximately $967,000.

23. For 2013, Defendantsâ promotional materials claimed an annualized growth rate
of 32.07% through April 30, 2013, when in actuality RFF lost an additional $433,000 during this
same period. By July 9, 2013, when Defendantsâ and Relief Defendantsâ assets were frozen by
the SRO, RFFâs cumulative trading losses totaled over $2 million.

24. Defendants further solicited prospective pool participants by claiming that RFF
had an âastoundingâ 37.08% (later revised downward to 36.56%) compound annual growth rate
since January 2009, and that an investment of $250,000 in 2009 would have yielded $964,591 as
of April 30, 2013, for a total return of 385.84%. These claims were false. In reality, pool
participants could not invest in RFF until Defendants began trading in September 2011, anda
pool participant who invested in RFF since then and remained invested until April 30, 2013,
would have suffered losses, not a 385.84% gain. White knew that Defendantsâ representations
regarding RFFâs purported profitability since 2009 were false because he formed RFF in 2011
and because he controlled RFFâs trading and bank accounts.

25. Although Defendantsâ trading was consistently unprofitable, Defendantsâ
promotional materials claimed that âRevelation Forex Fund has achieved positive gains in 42 of
the last 52 months (80.77% months with gains) through April 30, 2013.â White told prospective
pool participants at the âMoneyShowâ that RFF had never had two successive losing months.

These claims were false. Through April 30, 2013, RFF was profitable in only 7 of the 20 months
Case 4:13-cv-00382-RAS-DDB Document 149 Filed 03/30/15 Page 9 of 24 PagelD #: 2063

that Defendants were trading, meaning that in only approximately 35% of the months was RFF
profitable â not 80.77% as Defendants claimed. Contrary to Defendantsâ claims, only once was
RFF profitable for two successive months. White knew that the claims he made at the
âMoneyShowâ regarding the purported consistency of RFFâs profits were false because he
controlled RFFâs trading and bank accounts.

26. To lure prospective pool participants to invest, while concealing their trading
losses, Defendants claimed that RFF was recently recognized as the â#2 best performing [forex]
fundâ in the world by EliteForexFunds, which purported to be âThe Definitive Source on The
Worldâs Best Forex Funds.â Defendants solicited prospective pool participants with a chart
stating that the â#2â ranking was based upon âa minimum of 4 years [of] audited resultsâ and
which depicted their fraudulent claims of annual profits for RFF since 2009. These claims were
totally false. Defendantsâ chart showed purported profits for four full years, from 2009 to 2012,
when in fact they only began trading in September 2011, and lost money in both 2011 and 2012.
Further, EliteForexFunds was a sham ranking system manipulated by Defendants to mislead
prospective pool participants through fraudulent claims of âauditedâ results.

27, In their solicitation of pool participants, Defendants touted Whiteâs purported
25-year Wall Street career as including a âlong distinguished tenure at Shearson Loeb Rhodes
and predecessor firms . .. Shearson Lehman Brothers, Shearson Lehman Hutton... .â
Defendantsâ claims were false and contained material omissions. Whiteâs Wall Street career
lasted only approximately seven years and he was fired by both Shearson Lehman Brothers and
its successor firm, Shearson Lehman Hutton. White was subsequently censured and barred by
the New York Stock Exchange for unauthorized trades in customer accounts and making

material misstatements.
Case 4:13-cv-00382-RAS-DDB Document 149 Filed 03/30/15 Page 10 of 24 PagelD #: 2064

28. In connection with Defendantsâ misleading claims that White was a successful
Wall Street broker, Defendants failed to disclose that White filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in
1995 and that several federal tax liens had been filed against him.

29. During the Relevant Period, Defendants failed to disclose to actual and
prospective pool participants the material information that: (1) Defendants misappropriated pool
participantsâ funds; (2) Defendantsâ forex trading had been unprofitable; and (3) White was not
an experienced and successful Wall Street broker.

4, White Controlled RFF GP and KGW Capital

30. During the Relevant Period, White served as an officer of RFF GP and KGW
Capital. White exercised day-to-day control over the business activities of RFF GP and KGW
Capital by opening trading and bank accounts on RFF GPâs and KGW Capitalâs behalf and
serving as the sole signatory on said accounts. Additionally, White was responsible for the
creation of Defendantsâ websites and solicited prospective pool participants on behalf of RFF GP
and KGW Capital. Accordingly, White knew of, and personally controlled RFF GPâs and KGW
Capitalâs activities giving rise to the above-described acts.

IV. RESTITUTION AND CIVIL MONETARY PENALTY

A. Restitution

47. Defendants shall, jointly and severally, pay restitution in the amount of three
million, three-hundred sixty-five thousand, and eight hundred eight-eight dollars ($3,365,888)
(""Restitution Obligation""), plus post-judgment interest, within ten (10) days of the date of entry
of this Consent Order. If the Restitution Obligation is not paid in full within ten (10) days of the
date of entry of this Consent Order, then post-judgment interest shall accrue on the Restitution
Obligation beginning on the date of entry of this Consent Order and shall be determined by using
the Treasury Bill rate prevailing on the date of entry of this Consent Order pursuant to 28 U.S.C.
Â§ 1961 (2012).

48.  Toeffect payment of the Restitution Obligation and the distribution of any
restitution payments to Defendantsâ pool participants, the court appoints Kelly M. Crawford
(ââMonitorâ or âCrawfordâ), the Receiver in this case, as Monitor. The Monitor shall collect

restitution payments from Defendants and make distributions as set forth below. Because

15
Case 4:13-cv-00382-RAS-DDB Document 149 Filed 03/30/15 Page 16 of 24 PagelD #: 2070

Crawford is acting as an officer of this court in performing these services, Crawford shall not be
liable for any action or inaction arising from his appointment as Monitor, other than actions
involving fraud.

49. _ Defendants shall make Restitution Obligation payments under this Consent Order
to the Monitor in the name of the âKGW Receivershipâ account and shall send such Restitution
Obligation payments by electronic funds transfer, or by U.S. postal money order, certified check,
bank cashierâs check, or bank money order, to Kelly M. Crawford, Esq., Scheef & Stone, LLP,
500 North Akard Street, Dallas, Texas 75201, under cover letter that identifies the paying
Defendants and the name and docket number of this proceeding. Defendants shall

50.â The Monitor shall oversee the Restitution Obligation and shall have the discretion
to determine the manner of distribution of such funds in an equitable fashion to Defendantsâ pool
participants identified by the Commission or may defer distribution until such time as the
Monitor deems appropriate. In the event that the amount of Restitution Obligation payments to
the Monitor are of a de minimis nature such that the Monitor determines that the administrative
cost of making a distribution to eligible pool participants is impractical, the Monitor may, in his
discretion, treat such restitution payments as civil monetary penalty payments, which the
Monitor shall forward to the Commission following the instructions for civil monetary penalty

payments set forth in Section 1V.B below.

16
Case 4:13-cv-00382-RAS-DDB Document 149 Filed 03/30/15 Page 17 of 24 PagelD #: 2071

51. Defendants shall cooperate with the Monitor as appropriate to provide such
information as the Monitor deems necessary and appropriate to identify Defendantsâ pool
participants to whom the Monitor, in his sole discretion, may determine to include in any plan for

necessary to release funds that they have in any repository, bank, investment or other financial
institution, wherever located, in order to make partial or total payment toward the Restitution
Obligation.

(âNFAâ) shall serve as Monitor (the âPost-Receivership Monitorâ). Because the
Post-Receivership Monitor is acting as an officer of this court in performing these services, NFA
shall not be liable for any action or inaction arising from NFAâs appointment as the
Post-Receivership Monitor, other than actions involving fraud.

54. Upon the termination of the receivership estate, Defendants shall make
Restitution Obligation payments under this Consent Order to the Post-Receivership Monitor in

300 South Riverside Plaza, Suite 1800, Chicago, Illinois 60606, under cover letter that identifies
the paying Defendant and the name and docket number of this proceeding. Defendants shall
simultaneously transmit copies of the cover letter and the form of payment to the Chief Financial
Officer, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st

Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street, NW,
Washington, D.C. 20581.

55. | The amounts payable to each pool participant shall not limit the ability of any
pool participant from proving that a greater amount is owed from Defendants or any other person
or entity, and nothing herein shall be construed in any way to limit or abridge the rights of any
pool participant that exist under state or common law.

56. Pursuant to Rule 71 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, each pool participant
of Defendants who suffered a loss is explicitly made an intended third-party beneficiary of this
Consent Order and may seek to enforce obedience of this Consent Order to obtain satisfaction of
any portion of the restitution amount that has not been paid by Defendants to ensure continued
compliance with any provision of this Consent Order, and to hold Defendants in contempt for
any violations of any provision of this Consent Order.

57. To the extent that any funds accrue to the U.S. Treasury for satisfaction of
Defendantsâ Restitution Obligation, such funds shall be transferred to the Monitor or the
Post-Receivership Monitor for disbursement in accordance with the procedures set forth above.

Obligation concerning any funds paid by Defendants in SEC v. White, No. 4:13-cv-383-RAS-

of four million, one-hundred and fifty thousand dollars ($4,150,000) (âCMP Obligationâ), plus
post-judgment interest, within ten (10) days of the date of entry of this Consent Order. If the
CMP Obligation is not paid in full within ten (10) days of the date of entry of this Consent Order,
post-judgment interest shall accrue on the CMP Obligation beginning on the date of entry of this
Consent Order and shall be determined by using the Treasury Bill rate prevailing on the date of
entry of this Consent Order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1961 (2012).

60. Defendants shall pay their CMP Obligation by electronic funds transfer, U.S.
postal money order, certified check, bank cashierâs check, or bank money order. If payment is to

remaining balance.

D. Cooperation

Federal Court Orders Texas-based RFF GP, LLC, KGW Capital Management, LLC, and Kevin
G. White to Pay over $7.5 Million for Operating a Fraudulent Commodity Pool

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced that Judge Richard A.
Schell of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas entered a Consent Order for permanent injunction against
Defendants RFF GP, LLC, KGW Capital Management, LLC, and Kevin G. White, all of The Woodlands, Texas. The
Order, entered on March 30, 2015, requires the Defendants jointly to pay a $4,150,000 civil monetary penalty and
restitution of $3,365,888. The Order also imposes permanent trading and registration bans against them.

The Order stems from a CFTC Complaint filed on July 9, 2013 (See CFTC Press Release 6644-13, July 12, 2013), charging
the Defendants with fraud and misappropriation of pool participantsâ funds while operating a fraudulent commodity pool,
Revelation Forex Fund, LP. Defendants duped pool participants into investing in Revelation, a purported hedge fund
and commodity pool, which Defendants established for the purpose of trading off-exchange foreign currency (forex),
according to the Complaint.

The Order finds that the Defendants fraudulently solicited approximately $7.4 million from more than 20 pool
participants. Of this amount, Defendants misappropriated approximately $1.7 million of pool participantsâ funds. The
Order also finds that White used these misappropriated pool participantsâ funds for personal expenses, including a gym
membership, retail purchases, meals, travel, and a dog training service, among other things. In making their solicitations
through two websites and at a tradeshow presentation, Defendants fabricated Revelationâs performance and lied about
Whiteâs investment experience, according to the Order.

Related regulatory and criminal action

In a related regulatory action, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a Complaint against White
contemporaneously with the CFTCâs Complaint (SEC v. White, No. 4:13-cv-00383 (U.S. District Court for the Eastern
District of Texas)). The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas entered interlocutory judgments against White
and the other Defendants in this case on March 30, 2015.

In a related criminal action, on February 18, 2015, White was sentenced to 8 years in prison for mail fraud (United States
v. White, Case No. 8:13-cr-00035-UA (U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas)). (See CFTC Press Release
7127-15, February 26, 2015.)

The CFTC thanks the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commissionâs Fort Worth, Texas, regional office, the U.S. Attorneyâs
Office for the Eastern District of Texas, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Dallas Field Office, and the Nevada Office of
the Attorney General for their assistance and cooperation on this matter.

The CFTC cautions victims that restitution orders may not result in the recovery of money lost because the wrongdoers
may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers and to
ensure the wrongdoers are held accountable.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Harry E. Wedewer, Dmitriy Vilenskiy, John
Einstman, and Paul G. Hayeck.

ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO SECTIONS 6(c) AND 6(d) OF
THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, MAKING FINDINGS

AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

 

I.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ) has reason to believe that
during the period March 2011 through January 23, 2013, Hope Advisors LLC (âHALâ) violated
Section 4m(1) of the Commodity Exchange Act, (âActâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6m(1) (2012). The
Commission also has reason to believe that during the period March 2011 through August 2013,
HAL violated Commission Regulation (âRegulationâ) 4.22(d), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 4.22(d) (2014).
Therefore, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest that public
administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted to determine whether the Respondent
engaged in the violations set forth herein and to determine whether any order should be issued
imposing remedial sanctions.

IT.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, the Respondent has
submitted an Offer of Settlement (âOfferâ), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Without admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, Respondent consents to
the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 6(c) and 6(d) of the
Commodity Exchange Act, Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (âOrderâ) and
acknowledges service of this Order.'

 

' Respondent consents to the entry of this Order and to the use of these findings in this proceeding and in any other
proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party; provided, however, that Respondent
does not consent to the use of the Offer, or the findings or conclusions in this Order consented to in the Offer, as the
sole basis for any other proceeding brought by the Commission, other than in a proceeding in bankruptcy or to
enforce the terms of this Order. Nor does Respondent consent to the use of the Offer or this Order, or the findings or
conclusions in this Order consented to in the Offer, by any other party in any other proceeding.
Il.
The Commission finds the following:
A. SUMMARY

HAL operated Hope Investments LLC (âHILâ) as a commodity pool from March 2011
through January 23, 2013, without the benefit of registration as a commodity pool operator
(âCPOâ), in violation of Section 4m(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6m(1) (2012). Additionally, from
approximately March 2011 through August 2013, HAL provided monthly statements to HILâs
pool participants that showed only realized gains and losses, in violation of Regulation 4.22(d).

B. RESPONDENTS

Hope Advisors LLC is located in Brentwood, TN, and has been registered as a CPO
since January 24, 2013. During the period March 2011 through January 23, 2013, HAL operated
HIL, a commodity pool, without the benefit of registration as a CPO. Karen S. Bruton
(âBrutonâ) is President of HAL and is registered as its principal.

Cc. FACTS

HAL was formed in March 2011, and began operating HIL as a commodity pool at that
time. By January 2013, HIL had approximately 131 participants and a net asset value of over
$100 million. Although HAL and HIL were formed with the assistance of outside legal counsel,
neither HALâs counsel nor its principal, Bruton, was aware of Section 4m(1)âs requirement that
HAL register as a CPO. In approximately August 2012, HALâs retained counsel contacted the
National Futures Association (âNFAâ) to determine whether HAL was required to register as a
CPO or was exempt from registration requirements. Subsequent to that communication, HAL
commenced the registration process and began drafting the required disclosure documents. HAL
became registered as a CPO and approved as an NFA member on January 24, 2013.

On March 25, 2013, the NFA commenced an audit of HAL. During the audit process,
NFA determined that HAL was providing monthly reporting statements to HIL participants that
showed only realized gains and losses, in violation of Regulation 4.22(d). In fact, HALâs
monthly reporting statements were consistent with HALâs disclosure statement and agreement
with pool participants, which provided that participants would only be allocated realized gains
and losses. HAL separately reported unrealized gains and losses to HIL participants in the form
of audited K-1 statements that included realized and unrealized gains and losses on an annual
basis.

After the NFA audit disclosed its reporting deficiencies, HAL took remedial action to
correct the monthly pool statements it sent to participants. In particular, HAL retained a
consultant, which designed a Rule 4.22 compliant performance report that HAL sends to
participants each month, and the consultant trained HALâs staff on how to prepare the monthly
report and the performance disclosures contained in HILâs disclosure document. HAL also
replaced its auditing firm and hired a certified public accountant as its chief financial officer.
As of August 2013, HAL began issuing two monthly reports to HIL participants, one
showing realized gains/losses which is the report consistent with the participantsâ investment
terms, and a second based on net asset value showing realized and unrealized gains and losses,
which complies with Regulation 4.22(d). HAL also retained an audit firm to conduct an
independent monthly review of its performance reporting to ensure compliance with
Commission Regulations. The audit firmâs independent monthly review began in May 2013 and
will continue until May 2015.

IV.

LEGAL DISCUSSION

A. Respondent Violated Section 4m(1) of the Act

In 1974, Congress amended the Act to establish a more âcomprehensive regulatory
structure to oversee the volatile and esoteric futures trading complex.â CFTC vy. Schor, 478 U.S.
833, 836 (1986) (quoting H.R.Rep. No. 93-975, p. 1 (1974)). âRegistration is the kingpin in ...
[the Commissionâs] statutory machinery, giving the Commission the information about
participants in commodity trading which it so vitally requires to carry out its other statutory
functions of monitoring and enforcing the Act.â Flaxman v. CFTC, 697 F.2d 782, 787 (7th Cir.
1983) (quoting CFTC vy. British American, 560 F.2d 135, 139-40 (2d Cir. 1977), cert. denied,
438 U.S. 905 (1978)). The registration requirements ensure that persons dealing in commodities
meet certain minimum financial and fitness requirements, and enable the CFTC to monitor the
trading activities of market members. Ping He (Hai Nam) Co. v. NonFerrous Metals (U.S.A.)
Inc., 22 F. Supp. 2d 94, 102-04 (S.D.N.Y. 1998) opinion vacated in part on reconsideration, 187
F.R.D. 121 (S.D.N.Y. 1999).

Section 4m(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6m(1) (2012), makes it unlawful for a person to act
as a CPO and use the mails or any instrumentality of interstate commerce in connection with
oneâs business as a CPO without being registered with the Commission as a CPO, subject to
certain exceptions and exemptions not applicable here.* The registration requirement does not
contain a âstate of mindâ limitation to liability. There is a âflat prohibition ... against using the
facilities of interstate commerce to give commodity advice unless registered,â and â[w]hile fraud
and misconduct may also be violations of the Act ... violations of Â§ 6m alone are sufficientâ to
warrant the granting of an injunction. British Am. Commodity Options, 560 F.2d at 142; accord
CFTC v, Wilson, 19 F.Supp.3d 352, 361 (D. Mass. 2014) (investment company failed to register

 

2 Under the Act, the Commission has statutory authority to exclude entities from the definition of âCPO,â thereby
relieving such exempted entities from the CFTC's registration requirements and attendant obligations. See 7 U.S.C.
Â§ 1a(11)(B) (âThe Commission, by rule or regulation, may include within, or exclude from, the term âcommodity
pool operatorâ any person engaged in a business that is of the nature of a commodity pool, investment trust,
syndicate, or similar form of enterprise if the Commission determines that the rule or regulation will effectuate the
purposes of this chapter.â). The Commission has exercised this authority over the years to expand and contract
exclusions in response to new information and changing circumstances. In connection with the registration of
CPOs, Commission Regulation 4.13(a)(1), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 4.13(a)(1) exempts a CPO from registration if it does not
operate more than one commodity pool at a time, have more than 15 pool participants and the gross capital
contributions do not exceed $400,000. As noted above, HALâs pool had more than 15 participants and its gross
capital contributions exceeded $400,000.
asa CPO). As set forth above, HAL operated HIL as a commodity pool from March 2011
through January 23, 2013, without the benefit of registration as a CPO, thus violating Section
4m(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6m(1) (2012).

B. Respondent Violated Regulation 4.22(d)

Under the Act, CPOs are subject to regulatory requirements related to disclosure to
investors, see 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 4.21-4.22, 4.24-4.25, recordkeeping, id. Â§ 4.23, segregation of
investor assets, id. Â§ 4.20, and registration and reporting obligations. /nv. Co. Inst. v. CFTC, 891
F. Supp. 2d 162, 168-69 (D.D.C. 2012), as amended (Jan. 2, 2013), aff'd, 720 F.3d 370 (D.C.
Cir. 2013). The principal purpose of financial reporting required by Commission regulation
4,22(d) is to ensure that pool participants receive accurate, fair and timely information on the
overall trading performance and financial condition of the pool. As relevant here, Regulation
4,22(d) requires that commodity pool statements report both realized and unrealized gains and
losses. From approximately March 2011 through August 2013, HAL provided monthly
statements to HILâs pool participants that showed only realized gains and losses, in violation of
Regulation 4.22(d).

V.
FINDINGS OF VIOLATION

Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that, during the relevant period,
Respondent violated Section 4m(1) of the of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6m(1)(2012) and Regulation
4,22(d), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 4.22(d) (2014).

CFTC Orders Tennessee-based Commodity Pool Operator Hope Advisors LLC to Pay a
$100,000 Civil Monetary Penalty for Registration and Reporting Violations

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today entered an Order requiring Hope
Advisors LLC (HAL), a Brentwood, Tennessee, Commodity Pool Operator (CPO), to pay a $100,000 civil monetary
penalty for acting as a CPO without registering with the CFTC, as required, and for providing monthly statements to pool
participants that failed to show all the information required by Commission Regulation.

Registration Violations

The Order finds that HAL operates Hope Investments LLC (HIL) as a commodity pool. However, it commenced operating
HIL in March 2011 and continued to operate HIL through January 23, 2013, without the benefit of registration with the
CFTC as a CPO, in violation of the registration provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act. These provisions ensure that
persons dealing in commodities meet certain minimum financial and fitness requirements, and enable the CFTC to
monitor the trading activities of market members, the Order states.

Regulation 4.22(d) Reporting Deficiencies

In addition, the CFTC Order states that the principal purpose of financial reporting required by CFTC Regulation 4.22(d) is
to ensure that pool participants receive accurate, fair, and timely information on the overall trading performance and
financial condition of the pool. According to the Order, as relevant here, Regulation 4.22(d) requires that commodity pool
statements report both realized and unrealized gains and losses; however, the Order states that HAL was providing
monthly reporting statements to HIL participants that showed only realized gains and losses.

According to the Order, HAL learned it was required to register as a CPO in August 2012, and thereafter undertook the
registration process; it has been registered in that capacity since January 24, 2013. HAL also took remedial action to
correct the monthly pool statements it sent to pool participants, by retaining a consultant, who designed a compliant
performance report that HAL sends to participants each month. The Order also states that as of August 2013, HAL began
issuing two monthly reports to HIL participants, one showing realized gains/losses, and a second based on net asset
value showing realized and unrealized gains and losses that complies with the specific Commission reporting regulations.
According to the Order, no customers were injured by any of the previous omissions.

The following CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members are responsible for this case: Diane M. Romaniuk, Ava M.
Gould, Judith McCorkle, Scott R. Williamson, and Rosemary Hollinger.

The CFTC appreciates the assistance of the National Futures Association.

Bt EX PARTE STATUTORY RESTRAINING ORDER
AND ASSET FREEZE

 

Plaintiff, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ or âCFTCâ),
has filed a Complaint for Injunctive and Other Equitable Relief and Civil Monetary Penalties
under the Commodity Exchange Act and moved, pursuant to Section 6c(a) of the Commodity
Exchange Acct (the âActâ), for an ex parte statutory restraining order freezing assets, and
prohibiting the destruction of books, records, or other documents. This Court has considered the
pleadings, declarations, exhibits, and memorandum filed in support of the Commissionâs Motion
for Ex Parte Statutory Restraining Order (âSROâ) and finds that:

1. This Court has jurisdiction over the parties and over the subject matter of this
action pursuant to Sections 2(c)(2) and 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 2(c)(2) and 13a-1 (2012)
which authorizes the Commission to seek injunctive relief against any person whenever it shall
appear that such person has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in any act or practice

constituting a violation of any provision of the Act or any rule, regulation or order thereunder.

Case: 1:15-cv-03307 Document #: 3-1 Filed: 04/14/15 Page 2 of 8 PagelD #:21

2. Venue lies properly within this District pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act, 7
U.S.C. Â§13a-1(e) (2012), in that the Defendants are found, inhabit, or transact business in this
District, or the acts and practices in violation of the Act have occurred, are occurring or are about
to occur within this District.

3. There is good cause to believe that Defendants have engaged in, are engaging in,
or are about to engage in violations of 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6c(a) (2012) and 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.38(a) (2014).
Weighing the equities and considering the Commissionâs likelihood of success in its claims for
relief, the issuance of an SRO is in the public interest.

4. There is good cause for the Court to freeze certain assets owned, controlled,
managed, or held by or on behalf of, or for the benefit of Defendants. Absent the entry of this
statutory restraining order, Defendants are likely to dissipate or transfer assets and destroy
business records.

5. There is good cause for entry of an order prohibiting Defendants, their agents,
servants, employees, assigns, attorneys, and persons in active concert or participation with
Defendants, including any successor thereof, from destroying records and/or denying agents of
the Commission access to inspect and copy records to ensure that Commission representatives
have immediate and complete access to those books and records.

6. There is good cause to believe that immediate and irreparable damage to the
Courtâs ability to grant effective final relief in the form of monetary redress will occur from the
sale, transfer, assignment, or other disposition by Defendants of assets or records unless
Defendants are immediately restrained and enjoined by Order of the Court.

7. This is a proper case for granting an ex parfe statutory restraining order to

preserve the status quo and enable the Commission to fulfill its statutory duties.

CFTC Charges Matthew J. Marcus and His California Company, Tech Power, Inc., and John
D. Briner and His Canadian Law Firm, MetroWest Law Corp., with a Money Pass Scheme
Involving More than 1,200 Single Stock Futures Trades

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced that it filed a civil
enforcement action in federal court in Chicago against Matthew J. Marcus of California and his company, Tech Power,
Inc. (Tech Power), a Nevada corporation located in California, and John D. Briner, an attorney residing in Vancouver,
Canada, and his company, MetroWest Law Corporation (MetroWest), a Canadian law firm. The CFTC Complaint
charges the four Defendants with engaging in fictitious single stock futures transactions on OneChicago LLC
(OneChicago) and trading non-competitively.

On April 16, 2015, the Honorable Milton Shadur of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois entered a
restraining Order freezing certain assets and prohibiting the Defendants from destroying documents.

The CFTC Complaint alleges that over seven consecutive trading days from January 28, 2014 to February 5, 2014, the
Defendants engaged in 624 round-turn trades between an account carried in the name of MetroWest and an account
carried in the name of Tech Power involving 1,248 perfectly matched pre-arranged, non-competitive transactions in
single stock futures contracts listed on OneChicago. By structuring the transactions in this way, the Defendants allegedly
were able to ensure that MetroWest would trade with Tech Power and that Tech Power would always profit from the
transactions. According to the Complaint, through these transactions, the Defendants conducted a âmoney passâ
between the two accounts and moved at least $390,000 from MetroWest to Tech Power. Defendants carried out their
scheme on OneChicago using two trading accounts held at the same CFTC-registered futures commission merchant.

In its continuing litigation, the CFTC seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, civil monetary penalties, trading and
registration bans, and permanent injunctions against further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act, as charged.

The CFTC thanks OneChicago for its assistance.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Lindsey Evans, Diane Romaniuk, Heather
Johnson, Melissa Glasbrenner, Robert Howell, Scott Williamson, and Rosemary Hollinger.

ORDER

This matter comes before the Court on Plaintiff United States Commodity Futures
Trading Commission (""Commission"" or ""CFTC"")'s Emergency Ex Parte Statutory
Restraining Order filed under seal on April 14, 2015.

Contemporaneously with the instant Motion, the Commission filed a Complaint for
Injunctive and Other Relief and Penalties. The Commission moves under Section
6c(a) of the Commodity Exchange Act (the ""Act""), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(a), for an ex parte
statutory restraining order freezing assets and prohibiting the destruction of books,
records, or other documents. Having considered the pleadings, declarations,
exhibits, and memorandum filed in support of the Commission's Motion for an Ex

Parte Statutory Restraining Order, the Court finds as follows:

3-11
Case 2:15-cv-00237-SF@*CM Document 11 Filed 04/15/15âRage 2 of 10 PagelD 104

a. This Court has jurisdiction over the parties and over the subject matter
ofthis action under Sections 2(c)(2) and 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 2(c)(2) and 13a-1
(2012), which authorize the Commission to seek injunctive relief against any person
whenever it shall appear that such person has engaged, is engaging, or is about to
engage in any act or practice constituting a violation of any provision of the Act or any
tule, regulation, or order thereunder.

Bi Venue lies properly within this District under Section 6c(e) of the Act, 7
U.S.C.Â§ 13a-1(e) (2012), in that Defendants are found, inhabit, or transact business
in this District, and the acts and practices in violation of the Act have occurred, are
occurring or are about to occur within this District.

c. The Commission presented evidence that from May 2010 through the
present, Dorian A. Garcia, individually and as controlling person of DG Wealth
Management, Macroquantum Capital LLC, and UKUSA Currency Fund LP, and at
least two other unincorporated entities controlled by Garcia, Commodity Projections and
PredSyst, LLC (collectively referred to as ""Defendants""), fraudulently solicited at least
eighty (80) individuals to invest approximately $4.7 million in pooled retail off-exchange
foreign currency contracts (commonly known as forex"") on a leveraged or margined
basis, commodity options and a variety of other investment schemes. The Commission
also presented evidence that Garcia made misrepresentations and omitted material
facts to actual and prospective investors and pool participants by (1) falsely promising
their principal was protected with a large cash and collateral account; (2)
misrepresenting the total amount of funds managed; (3) falsely reporting historically

large profits in existing trading accounts; and (4) failing to disclose that he
Case 2:15-cv-00237-SP@*â¬M Document 11 Filed 04/15/15-Rage 3 of 10 PagelD 105

misappropriated investor funds. These representations and omissions, among others,
operated as a fraud or deceit upon actual and prospective investors and pool
participants. The Commission also presented evidence that Garcia's misrepresentations
continued for more than four (4) years and became an integral part of Garcia's
underlying fraud of operating a Ponzi scheme and misappropriating investor funds.

d. Weighing the equities and considering the Commission's likelihood of
success in its claims for relief, the issuance of a statutory restraining order is in the
public interest and there is good cause to believe that Defendants have engaged in,
are engaging in, or are about to engage in fraudulent conduct in violation of Sections
4b(a)(2)(A)-(C), 4c(b), 40(1) and 6(c)(1), of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6b(a)(2)(A)-(C),
6c(b), 60(1) and 9(1) (2012), and Regulations 4.20(c), 5.2(b)(J)-(3), 33.10, and 180.1,
17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 4.20(c), 5.2(b)(1)-(3), 33.10 and 180.1 (2014), and by failing to register
in various capacities, in violation of Sections 2(c)(2)(C)(iii)(1)(cc), 4k(2) and 4m(1) of
the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 2(c)(2)(C)(iii)(I)(cc), 6k(2) and 6m(1), and Regulations 3.12,
5.3(a)(2)(i)-(ii), 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 3.12, 5.3 (a)(2)(i), 5.3(a)(2)(ii) (2014).

e. There is good cause to believe that immediate and irreparable damage
to the Court's ability to grant effective final relief for pool participants in the form of
monetary redress will occur from the sale, transfer, assignment, or other disposition
by Defendants of assets or records unless Defendants are immediately restrained
and enjoined by Order of the Court.

f. There is good cause for the Court to freeze assets owned, controlled,

managed, or held by or on behalf of, or for the benefit of Defendants. Absent the entry
Case 2:15-cv-00237-SP@*EM Document 11 Filed 04/15/15-eRage 4 of 10 PagelD 106

of this statutory restraining order, Defendants are likely to dissipate or transfer assets
and destroy business records.

g. There is good cause for entry of an order prohibiting Defendants, their
agents, servants, employees, assigns, attorneys, and persons in active concert or
participation with Defendants, including any successor thereof, from destroying records
and/or denying agents of the Commission immediate and complete access to
Defendantsâ books and records for inspection and copying.

h. This is a proper case for granting an ex parte statutory restraining order
to preserve the status quo, protect public investors and pool participants from loss
and damage, and enable the Commission to fulfill its statutory duties.

Accordingly, it is

ORDERED:

(1) Plaintiff United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission's Under

including but not limited to: (i) all documentswithin your custody or
control of any of your present or former agents, employers, employees,
partners; and (ii) all documents that you have a legal or equitable right
to obtain from another person. A draft or non-identical copy is a

includes the file and folder tabs associated with each original and copy.

c. âDefendantsâ refer to Dorian A. Garcia, DG Wealth Management,
Macroquantum Capital LLC, and UKUSA Currency Fund LP and any

CFTC Charges Florida Resident Dorian A. Garcia and his Companies, DG Wealth
Management, Macroquantum Capital LLC, and UKUSA Currency Fund LP with Fraud and
Registration Violations

Garcia Allegedly Operated a Ponzi Scheme in Connection with Forex and
Options Pools and Stole Approximately $2.5 Million Invested by
Customers

Federal Court Enters Emergency Order Freezing Defendantsâ Assets and
Protecting Books and Records

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) announced that Judge Sheri Polster
Chappell of the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida entered an emergency restraining Order freezing
assets and prohibiting the destruction or concealment of books and records of Defendants Dorian A. Garcia, and his
companies, DG Wealth Management (DG Wealth), Macroquantum Capital LLC, and UKUSA Currency Fund LP, all
of Naples, Florida. The judge set a hearing date for April 29, 2015.

The Courtâs Order arises from a CFTC Complaint filed under seal on April 14, 2015, charging the Defendants with fraud in
connection with their solicitation of customers for their foreign currency (forex) and options trading pools,
misappropriation of customer funds, and their issuance of false statements and registration violations, in violation of the
Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC Regulations.

According to the CFTC Complaint, the Defendants fraudulently solicited approximately $4.7 million from at least 80
customers to invest in forex and options pools beginning as early as May 2010. The Complaint alleges that Garcia made a
number of misrepresentations to those he solicited, including: (1) falsely promising them that their principal was
protected with a large collateral account; (2) misrepresenting the total amount of funds he had under management; (3)
falsely reporting large profits in existing trading accounts; and (4) failing to disclose that he misappropriated investor
funds. Many of Garciaâs misrepresentations were contained within bank and trading firm account statements that he
emailed to investors that were falsified to reflect exaggerated account balances.

The CFTC Complaint alleges that Garcia returned nearly $2.1 million to investors in a manner akin to a Ponzi scheme and
misappropriated approximately $2.5 million of investor funds. Garcia used the misappropriated funds for his personal and
business expenses such as art, domestic help, jewelry, and cash transfers to his personal bank accounts, according to the
Complaint.

The Complaint also alleges that Garcia and DG Wealth acted in capacities requiring them to register with the
Commission, but were not registered with the CFTC, as required.

In its continuing litigation, the CFTC seeks restitution, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, civil monetary penalties, trading
and registration bans, and a permanent injunction against further violations of federal commodities laws, as charged.

The CFTC appreciates the assistance of the Florida Office of Financial Regulation, Bureau of Financial Investigations,
Miami, Florida.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Susan Padove, Ashley Burden, Mary Elizabeth
Spear, Ava M. Gould, Scott R. Williamson, and Rosemary Hollinger.

GRANTING PLAINTIFF'S EX PARTE MOTION FOR STATUTORY RESTRAINING -
ORDER AND OTHER RELIEF

This matter is before the on Plaintiff's Ex Parte Motion for a Statutory Restraining Order,
Preliminary Injunction, and Other Equitable Relief, and Incorporated Memorandum in Support
(âMotionâ) in the above-captioned proceeding. Simultaneously with the Motion, Plaintiff U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ or âCFTCâ) filed a Complaint for
Injunctive Relief, Civil Monetary Penalties, and Other Equitable Relief against Defendants Nav
Sarao Futures Limited PLC and Navinder Singh Sarao (collectively, âDefendantsâ). In the
Motion, the Commission moves, pursuant to Section 6c(a) of the Commodity Exchange Act
(âthe Actâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(a) (2012), for an ex parte statutory restraining order freezing assets
and prohibiting theâ destruction of books, records, or other documents; an accounting; and for an

- order requiring Defendants to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not issue.

 

The Court has considered the pleadings, declarations, exhibits, and memorandum filed in

support of the Commissionâs Motion, and now, being fully advised, finds as follows:

Page | of 11
1. This Court has jurisdiction over the parties and over the subject matter of this action
pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2012).

2. Venue properly lies within this District pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act, 7
U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(e) (2012).

â 3. There is good cause to believe that Defendants have engaged, are engaging, and/or
may .continue to engage in acts and practices constituting violations of the Act Sections
4c(a)(5)(C), 6(c)(1) and (3),' and 9(a)(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6c(a)(5)(C), 9(1) & (3), and
13(a)(2) (2012), and Commission Regulations (âRegulationsâ) 180.1 and 180.2, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§

| 180.1 and 180.2 (2014), which, among other things, make it unlawful for any person to
manipulate, attempt to manipulate, use a manipulative device, or attempt to use a manipulative
device, or spoof the market of any commodity in interstate commerce or for future delivery on or
subject to the rules of any registered entity, including any contract market.
4. The Commission has presented evidence that, from at least April 2010 to January
2012; July 2012 to June 2014; and September 2014 to present (âRelevant Periodâ), Defendants
have manipulated, attempted to manipulate and/or spoofed the near month of the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange E-mini S&P futures contract (âB-mini S&Pâ). Similarly, the CFTC has
presented evidence that Defendants have profited over $40 million from E-mini S&P trading
during the Relevant Period.
5. Prior notice to Defendants of an asset freeze is likely to result in dissipation of
Defendantsâ assets making it difficult for this Court ultimately to grant effective relief.
Similarly, given the ease of destroying books, records, and other documents, an order prohibiting

\

the destruction of rele 7 ing the Commission immediate-access-to-inspeet_â_____â_

 

"" Section 6(c)(1) and (3) of the Act became effective on August 15, 2011. Prior to that date, Defendantsâ conduct is
alleged to have violated Section 6(c) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 9, 15 (2008).

and copy those documents will increase the likelihood of a meaningful opportunity for the
Commission, and ultimately this Court, to determine the full scope of Defendantsâ allegedly
unlawful scheme.

6. There is good cause to believe that immediate and irreparable damage to the
Courtâs ability to grant effective final sanctions in the form of monetary or other redress will
occur from the sale, transfer, assignment, or other disposition by Defendants of assets or
documents unless Defendants are immediately restrained and enj oined by Order of the Court.

7. There is good cause for entry of an order freezing assets owned, controlled,
managed, or held by, on behalf of, or for the benefit of Defendants. |

8. There is good cause for entry of an order prohibiting Defendants, their agents,
servants, employees, assigns, attorneys, and persons in active concert or participation with
Defendants, from destroying relevant books, records, and other documents and/or denying agents.
of the Commission immediate and complete access to Defendantsâ books and records for
inspection and copying.

CFTC Charges U.K. Resident Navinder Singh Sarao and His Company Nav Sarao Futures
Limited PLC with Price Manipulation and Spoofing

The CFTC Complaint Alleges that Defendantsâ Manipulative Conduct
Contributed to the Market Conditions that Led to the May 6, 2010 Flash
Crash

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced the unsealing of a civil
enforcement action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against Nav Sarao Futures Limited PLC
(Sarao Futures) and Navinder Singh Sarao (Sarao) (collectively, Defendants). The CFTC Complaint charges the
Defendants with unlawfully manipulating, attempting to manipulate, and spoofing â all with regard to the E-mini S&P
500 near month futures contract (E-mini S&P). The Complaint had been filed under seal on April 17, 2015 and kept sealed
until todayâs arrest of Sarao by British authorities acting at the request of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). After the
arrest, the DOJ unsealed its own criminal Complaint charging Sarao with substantively the same misconduct.

The Standard & Poorâs 500 Index is an index of 500 stocks designed to be a leading indicator of U.S. equities. The E-mini
S&P 500 is a stock market index futures contract based on the Standard & Poorâs 500 Index and is one of the most
popular and liquid equity index futures contracts in the world. The contract is traded only at the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange (CME).

According to the Complaint, for over five years and continuing as recently as at least April 6, 2015, Defendants have
engaged in a massive effort to manipulate the price of the E-mini S&P by utilizing a variety of exceptionally large,
aggressive, and persistent spoofing tactics. In particular, according to the Complaint, in or about June 2009, Defendants
modified a commonly used off-the-shelf trading platform to automatically simultaneously âlayerâ four to six exceptionally
large sell orders into the visible E-mini S&P central limit order book (the Layering Algorithm), with each sell order one
price level from the other. As the E-mini S&P futures price moved, the Layering Algorithm allegedly modified the price of
the sell orders to ensure that they remained at least three or four price levels from the best asking price; thus, remaining
visible to other traders, but staying safely away from the best asking price. Eventually, the vast majority of the Layering
Algorithm orders were canceled without resulting in any transactions. According to the Complaint, between April 2010
and April 2015, Defendants utilized the Layering Algorithm on over 400 trading days.

The Complaint alleges that Defendants often cycled the Layering Algorithm on and off several times during a typical
trading day to create large imbalances in the E-mini S&P visible order book to affect the prevailing E-mini S&P price.
Defendants then allegedly traded in a manner designed to profit from this temporary artificial volatility. According to the
Complaint, from April 2010 to present, Defendants have profited over $40 million, in total, from E-mini S&P trading.

As alleged in the Complaint, Defendants were exceptionally active in the E-mini S&P on May 6, 2010, commonly known
as the Flash Crash Day. On the afternoon of that day, the E-mini S&P market price suffered a sharp decline, followed
shortly thereafter by sharp declines in the prices of other major U.S. equities indices and individual equities. After a few
minutes, markets quickly rebounded to near previous price levels. According to the Complaint, Defendants utilized the
Layering Algorithm continuously, for over two hours, immediately prior to the precipitous drop in the E-mini S&P price,
applying close to $200 million worth of persistent downward pressure on the E-mini S&P price. According to the
Complaint, Defendantsâ manipulative activities contributed to an extreme E-mini S&P order book imbalance that
contributed to market conditions that led to the Flash Crash.

The Complaint further alleges that Defendants engaged in a variety of other manual spoofing techniques whereby
Defendants allegedly would place and quickly cancel large orders with no intention of the orders resulting in
transactions. At times, according to the Complaint, this manual spoofing was used to exacerbate the price impact of the
Layering Algorithm.

CFTC Director of Enforcement Aitan Goelman commented: âProtecting the integrity and stability of the U.S. futures
markets is critical to ensuring a properly functioning financial system. Todayâs actions make clear that the CFTC, working
with its partners on the criminal side, will find and prosecute manipulators of U.S. futures markets wherever they may
be.â

In its ongoing litigation, the CFTC is seeking permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement, civil monetary penalties, trading
suspensions or bans, and payment of costs and fees.

As noted above, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a related criminal action charging Sarao with manipulation,
attempted manipulation, spoofing, and wire fraud on February 11, 2015, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District
of Illinois. In conjunction with that action, Scotland Yard took Sarao into custody today, at his residence in London. Sarao
awaits extradition to the United States on these charges.
Given Defendantsâ ongoing unlawful conduct and the potential for dissipation of Defendantsâ ill-gotten gains, on April 17,
2015, U.S. District Judge Andrea R. Wood issued an Order freezing and preserving assets under Defendantsâ control and
prohibiting them from destroying documents or denying CFTC staff access to their books and records. The Court has
scheduled a hearing for May 1, 2015, on the CFTCâs motion for a preliminary injunction.

The CFTC thanks and acknowledges the assistance of the CME, the U.S. Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, the U.K.âs Financial Conduct Authority, Scotland Yard, and the Securities and Exchange Commission.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this matter are Jeff Le Riche, Jo Mettenburg, Jenny Chapin,
Jessica Harris, Allison Sizemore, Carlin Metzger, Elizabeth Padgett, Mary Lutz, Jeri Cobb, Jordon Grimm, Rick Glaser, and
Charles Marvine.

Plaintiff, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ), by its

attorneys, alleges as follows:
I. SUMMARY

1. From at least March 2012, and continuing through at least July 2013 (the
âRelevant Periodâ), Defendant Sentry Asset Group, LLC dba Sentry Asset Management, LLC
(âSAGâ), by and through the actions of its employees and agents, including, but not limited to
Defendant, John Pakel (âPakelâ), (collectively, ââDefendantsââ), offered to enter into, or conducted
any office or business in the United States, for the purpose of soliciting or accepting any order
for the purchase or sale of precious metals from retail customers on a leveraged or financed
basis. These transactions constituted illegal, off-exchange retail commodity transactions. By
this conduct, Defendants have engaged, are engaging, or are about to engage in conduct in

violation of the Commodity Exchange Act (âActâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6(a) and 6d(a) (2012).
Case 9:15-cv-80506-XXXX Document1 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/20/2015 Page 2 of 14

2. Pakel controlled SAG throughout the Relevant Period and failed to act in good
faith or knowingly induced SAGâs violations alleged herein. Therefore, Pakel is liable for
SAGâs violations pursuant to 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13c(b) (2012).

3. At all relevant times, the acts and omissions of Pakel and others were committed
within the scope of their employment, agency, or office with SAG. Therefore, SAG is liable
under 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(a)(1)(B) (2012), and Commission Regulation (âRegulationâ) 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.2
(2014), as a principal for the actions and omissions of Pakel, and any other manager, employee
or agent of SAG in violation of the Act.

4, Accordingly, pursuant to 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2012), the Commission brings this
action to enjoin Defendantsâ unlawful acts and practices, to compel their compliance with the
Act, and to further enjoin them from engaging in any commodity-related activity.

5. In addition, the Commission seeks civil monetary penalties, restitution and
remedial ancillary relief, including, but not limited to, trading and registration bans,
disgorgement, rescission, pre- and post-judgment interest, and such other relief as the Court may
deem necessary and appropriate.

6. Unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, Defendants likely will continue to
engage in the acts and practices alleged in this Complaint and similar acts and practices, as more
fully described below.

II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

7. 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2012) authorizes the Commission to seek injunctive relief
against any person whenever it shall appear to the Commission that such person has engaged, is
engaging, or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a violation of any provision of

the Act or any rule, regulation, or order thereunder.

14

8. The Commission has jurisdiction over the conduct and transactions at issue in this
case pursuant to 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 2(c)(2)(D) and 13a-1 (2012).

9, Venue properly lies with the Court pursuant to 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(e) (2012),
because Defendants transacted business in this District, and certain transactions, acts, and
practices alleged in this Complaint occurred, are occurring, and/or are about to occur within this
District.

IV. RELATED ENTITIES

13. SAG introduced customers to Hunter Wise Commodities, LLC (âHunter
Wiseâ), a precious metals dealer that confirmed the execution of customer precious metal
transactions, directly or through Lloyds Commodities, LLC (âLloydsâ). Hunter Wise was
formed as a California company in July 2007 and registered as a Nevada company in October
2010. It maintained business addresses in Las Vegas, Nevada and Irvine, California. Hunter
Wise held itself out on its website as âa physical commodity trading company, wholesaler,
market maker, back-office support provider, and finance company.â Hunter Wise purported to
offer, enter into, and confirm the execution of retail commodity transactions involving gold,
silver, platinum, palladium, and copper throughout the United States using a network of
telemarketing solicitors such as SAG that it referred to as âdealers.â

14. On February 19, 2014, this Court, in an action captioned CFTC v. Hunter Wise
Commodities, LLC, granted the Commission's Motion for Summary Judgment finding that
Hunter Wise and the other defendants violated 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6(a) (2012). Case No. 9:12-cv-81311-
DMM (S.D. Fla. Feb. 19, 2014).

15. Lloyds is a Florida limited liability company with its principal place of business
in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. Lloyds was an intermediary firm that recruited precious metals
dealers to solicit customers who would execute retail commodity transactions through Hunter
Wise. Lloyds has never been registered with the Commission.

16. SAG also introduced customers to AmeriFirst Management, LLC
(âAmeriFirstâ), a precious metals wholesaler and clearing firm that purported to confirm the

execution of customer off-exchange retail commodity transactions.
Case 9:15-cv-80506-XXXX Document1 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/20/2015 Page 5 of 14

17. AmeriFirst held itself out on its website as a precious metals clearing and
financing firm for precious metals dealers and claimed to provide dealers with âtangible assets in
a growing physical marketâ and guarantee[s] that every ounce of metal in [the dealerâs]
customers [sic] account exists and is ready for delivery at any point and time.â On its website,
AmeriFirstâs product offering was gold, silver, and platinum in bar and coin form. AmeriFirst
also claimed on its website to provide customer financing options for precious meta! dealers. It
operated throughout the United States using a network of over 30 solicitation firms such as SAG
that it refers to as âdealers.â

18. On February 25, 2013, AmeriFirst ceased operations.

19. On September 17, 2013, this Court, in an action captioned CFTC v. AmeriFirst
Management, LLC, entered a Consent Order of Permanent Injunction Against AmeriFirst,
finding that AmeriFirst violated 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6(a) (2012). Case No. 9:13-cv-61637-WPD (S.D.
Fla. Sept. 17, 2013). In the order, AmeriFirst neither admitted nor denied its violations of
7 U.S.C. Â§ 6(a) (2012). Id.

V. STATUTORY BACKGROUND

20. 7 U.S.C. Â§2(c)(2)(D) (2012) gives the Commission jurisdiction over âany
agreement, contract, or transaction in any commodityâ that is entered into with, or offered to, a
non-eligible contract participant (âECPâ) âon a leveraged or margined basis, or financed by the
offeror, the counterparty, or a person acting in concert with the offeror or counterparty on a
similar basisâ (âretail commodity transactionsâ) with respect to conduct occurring on or after
July 16, 2011, subject to certain exceptions not applicable here. 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(c)(2)(D) makes 7
U.S.C. Â§ 6(a) (2012) applicable to retail commodity transactions âas if such transactions are

contracts for the sale of a commodity for future delivery.
Case 9:15-cv-80506-XXXX Document1 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/20/2015 Page 6 of 14

21. The Act defines an ECP, in relevant part, as an individual who has amounts
invested on a discretionary basis, the aggregate of which exceeds $10 million, or $5 million if the
individual enters into the transaction to manage the risk associated with an asset owned or
liability incurred, or reasonably likely to be owned or incurred, by the individual. 7 U.S.C.

Â§ 1a(18)(xi) (2012).

22. 7U.,S.C. Â§ 6(a) (2012) in relevant part, makes it is unlawful for any person to
offer to enter into, execute, confirm the execution of, or conduct any office or business anywhere
in the United States for the purpose of soliciting, accepting any order for, or otherwise dealing in
any transaction in, or in connection with, a contract for the purchase or sale of a commodity for
future delivery unless the transaction is conducted on or subject to the rules of a board of trade
that has been designated or registered by the Commission as a contract market.

23. 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6d(a) (2012) in relevant part, provides that it shall be unlawful for any
person to be a futures commission merchant (âFCMâ) unless such person shall have registered
with the Commission as an FCM. In pertinent part, 17 C.F.R Â§1a (28) (2014) defines an FCM as
âan individual, association, partnership, corporation, or trust that is engaged in soliciting or in
accepting orders for...any agreement, contract, or transaction described in 7 U.S.C. Â§

2(c)(2\(C)(i) of this title or 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(c)(2)(D)(i)....â

VI. FACTS
24. During the Relevant Period, SAG was a telemarketing firm that solicited retail
customers to engage in off-exchange retail commodity transactions involving leveraged precious

metals. Although SAG also offered precious metals on a fully paid basis, the vast majority of its

14
Case 9:15-cv-80506-XXXX Document1i Entered on FLSD Docket 04/20/2015 Page 7 of 14

business was in off-exchange retail commodity transactions. It is only SAGâs off-exchange retail
commodity transactions through Hunter Wise and AmeriFirst that are at issue here.

25. During the Relevant Period, Pakel was a managing member, owner and
controlling person of SAG. Pakel was a signatory on SAG bank accounts, and entered into
agreements with AmeriFirst on behalf of SAG.

26. At various times during the Relevant Period, SAG employed Pakel and other
individuals to, among other things, solicit retail customers to engage in off-exchange retail
commodity transactions.

27. Pakel and SAGâs other employees conducted nearly all of their solicitations by
telephone. When soliciting customers for off-exchange retail commodity transactions, Pakel and
SAGâs other employees represented that to purchase a certain quantity of metal, the customers
needed to deposit a percentage of the total metal value, and that customers would receive a loan
for the remaining amount. Lloyds, Hunter Wise or AmeriFirst provided the financing for the
loans to the customers. However, SAG did not disclose to all of their customers Lloydsâ, Hunter
Wiseâs or AmeriFirstâs involvement in their off-exchange retail commodity transactions.

28. After a non-ECP customer invested, SAG contacted Lloyds, Hunter Wise or
AmeriFirst to effectuate the transaction. SAG collected the funds needed for the transaction
from the customer and sent them to Lloyds, Hunter Wise or AmeriFirst. Lloyds purportedly
forwarded funds that it received from SAG to Hunter Wise. Hunter Wise and AmeriFirst
provided back office support services to SAG and provided access to the details of the
transaction to the customer.

29. With respect to the retail commodity transactions, SAG charged customers

commissions, storage and other fees for purchasing the metal and interest on loans to buy metal.

14
Case 9:15-cv-80506-XXXX Document1 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/20/2015 Page 8 of 14

Lloyds/Hunter Wise provided SAGâs share of the commissions and fees to SAG after it received
the customerâs funds from SAG. AmeriFirst initially operated in a similar fashion, but it later
directed SAG to deduct its commissions and fees from customer funds before forwarding those
funds to AmeriFirst.

30. With the exception of a few instances which are not the subject of this action,
SAGâs customers did not take delivery of precious metals. Rather, the vast majority of SAGâs
customers were only engaging in these transactions with SAG in order to speculate on the price
direction of the precious metals.

31. Of more than $1.1 million collected by SAG during the Relevant Period,
$278,767 was paid to managers of SAG, presumably in the form of fees and commissions.

32. SAG, Lloyds, Hunter Wise and AmeriFirst never bought, sold, loaned, stored, or
transferred any physical metals for these off-exchange retail commodity transactions. Likewise,
SAG, Lloyds, Hunter Wise and AmeriFirst never delivered any precious metals to any customers
with respect to these financed metals transactions.

33. At all times during the Relevant Period, Pakel was an owner, operator and
controlling person of SAG. He exercised control over the day-to-day operations of SAG, opened
bank accounts and entered into agreements on behalf of SAG.

ILLEGAL OFF-EXCHANGE TRADING
Violations of 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6(a) (2012)

7 ULS.C. Â§ 1a(9) (2012).

37. As set forth above, during the Relevant Period, Defendants SAG and Pakel

execution of, or conducting an office or business in the United States for the purpose of soliciting
or accepting orders for, or otherwise dealing in, transactions in, or in connection with, retail
commodity transactions.

38. Each offer to enter into, entrance into, execution, confirmation, solicitation, or
acceptance of an order for a retail commodity transaction made during the Relevant Period to a
non-ECP customer is alleged as a separate and distinct violation of 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6(a) (2012).

knowingly induced, directly or indirectly, the acts constituting SAGâs violations of 7 U.S.C. Â§
6(a) (2012), alleged in this Complaint. Therefore, pursuant to 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13c(b) (2012), Pakel is
liable for each of SAGâs violations of 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6(a) (2012).

acted as an FCM by soliciting and accepting orders for agreements, contracts, or transactions
described in 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(c)(2)(D)(i) (2012), i.e., retail commodity transactions.

43. 7 ULS.C. Â§ 6d(a) (2012) provides that it shall be unlawful for any person to be an
FCM unless such person shall have registered with the Commission as an FCM.

44. â_ During the relevant period, Defendants failed to register with the Commission as
an FCM, and therefore, violated 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6d(a) (2012).

45. Pakel directly or indirectly controlled SAG and did not act in good faith or
knowingly induced, directly or indirectly, the acts constituting SAGâs violations of 7 U.S.C. Â§

CFTC Charges Florida-Based Sentry Asset Group, LLC and its Owner, John Pakel, with
Engaging in Illegal, Off-Exchange Precious Metals Transactions

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced that it filed a civil
enforcement action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida against Defendants Sentry Asset
Group, LLC (SAG) of Boca Raton, Florida, and its owner and manager, John Pakel of Del Ray, Florida. The CFTC
Complaint charges the Defendants with engaging in illegal, off-exchange transactions in precious metals with retail
customers on a leveraged, margined, or financed basis. The Complaint further alleges that as controlling person for SAG,
Pakel is liable for SAGâs violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA).

According to the Complaint, since at least March 2012 and continuing through at least July 2013, SAG, by and through its
employees including Pakel, solicited retail customers by telephone to engage in leveraged, margined, or financed
precious metals transactions. During the period, SAGâs customers paid more than $1.1 million to SAG in connection with
precious metal transactions, and SAG received commissions and fees totaling $278,767 in connection with these precious
metals transactions. In addition, the Complaint alleges that SAG accepted customer orders and funds and thus acted as a
Futures Commission Merchant without registering with the CFTC as such.

Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, leveraged, margined, or financed
transactions such as those conducted by SAG, are illegal off-exchange transactions unless they result in actual delivery of
metal within 28 days. The Complaint alleges that metals were never actually delivered in connection with the leveraged,
margined, or financed precious metals transactions made on behalf of SAGâs customers.

The Order further finds that SAG and Pakel executed the illegal precious metals transactions through Lloyds
Commodities, LLC (Lloyds), Hunter Wise, LLC (Hunter Wise), and AmeriFirst Management LLC (AmeriFirst). The
CFTC filed enforcement actions against, among others, Lloyds and Hunter Wise in December 2012 and AmeriFirst in July
2013, charging each with engaging in illegal, off-exchange precious metals transactions, and charging AmeriFirst and
Hunter Wise with fraud and other violations (see CFTC Press Releases 6447-12 and 6655-13).

On September 18, 2013, the court entered a consent Order resolving the Commission's claims against AmeriFirst, finding
it liable for illegal off-exchange precious metals transactions and fraud (see CFTC Press Release 6973-14).

On February 5, 2014, in a consent Order resolving the Commissionâs claims against Lloyds, the court ordered Lloyds
Commodities to pay over $5 million in restitution and penalties (see CFTC Press Release 6850-14).

On February 19, 2014, the court found that Hunter Wise had no actual metal to deliver to customers and held that Hunter
Wise engaged in illegal precious metals transactions and was required to register as a Futures Commission Merchant but
did not do so and therefore violated Sections 4(a) and 4d of the CEA (see CFTC v. Hunter Wise Commodities, LLC, et al.,
12-81311-ClV (Order on the Partiesâ Motions for Summary Judgment)). On April 15, 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Eleventh Circuit affirmed the courtâs issuance of a preliminary injunction and held that the Commissionâs jurisdiction
under Section 2(c)(2)(D) of the CEA extends to the precious metals transactions at issue in the case and that no
exception to the Commissionâs jurisdiction applied. And, on May 16, 2014, after a bench trial on the remaining claims,
including fraud, the court entered an Order finding that Hunter Wise fraudulently misrepresented the nature of precious
metals transactions that resulted in millions of dollars in customer losses (see CFTC Press Release 6935-14).

In its continuing litigation against SAG and Pakel, the CFTC seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, civil monetary
penalties, permanent registration and trading bans, and a permanent injunction from future violations of the CEA, as
charged.

The CFTC cautions victims that restitution orders may not result in the recovery of money lost because the wrongdoers
may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers and to
ensure the wrongdoers are held accountable.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this action are Eugenia Vroustouris, Michael Loconte, James
H. Holl, lll, and Rick Glaser.

CFTCâs Precious Metals Customer Fraud Advisory

The CFTC has issued several customer protection Fraud Advisories that provide the warning signs of fraud, including the
Precious Metals Fraud Advisory, which alerts customers to precious metals fraud and lists simple ways to spot precious

ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTIONS 6(c) AND 6(d) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, MAKING
FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

I.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ or âCFTCâ) has reason to
believe that Deutsche Bank AG (âDeutsche Bankâ or âRespondentâ) has violated Sections 6(c),
6(d) and 9(a)(2) of the Commodity Exchange Act (the âActâ or the âCEAâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 9, 13b
and 13(a)(2) (2006). Therefore, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest
that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted to determine whether
Respondent has engaged in the violations set forth herein, and to determine whether any order
shall be issued imposing remedial sanctions.

I.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Respondent has
submitted an Offer of Settlement (âOfferââ), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Without admitting or denying the findings or conclusions herein, except to the extent Respondent
admits those findings in any related action against Deutsche Bank by, or any agreement with, the
Department of Justice or any other governmental agency or office, Respondent herein consents
to the entry and acknowledges service of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Sections
6(c) and 6(d) of the Commodity Exchange Act, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial
Sanctions (âOrderâ),

 

Respondent consents to the entry of this Order and to the use of these findings in this proceeding and
in any other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party; provided,
however, that Respondent does not consent to the use of the Offer, or the findings or conclusions in this
Order, as the sole basis for any other proceeding brought by the Commission, other than in a proceeding
in bankruptcy or to enforce the terms of this Order. Nor does Respondent consent to the use of the Offer
or this Order, or the findings or conclusions in this Order consented to in the Offer, by any other party in
any other proceeding.

 
Il.

The Commission finds the following:

A, Summary

For more than six years, from at least 2005 through early 2011 (the ârelevant periodâ),
Deutsche Bank, by and through the acts of certain employees, engaged in systemic and pervasive
misconduct directed at manipulating critical, international financial benchmark rates, the London
Interbank Offered Rate (âLIBORâ) and the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (âEuriborââ). Deutsche
Bankâs profit-driven misconduct undermined the integrity of LIBOR and Euribor and the
integrity of the U.S. and global financial markets.

LIBOR and Euribor are the basis for trillions of dollars of financial instruments,
particularly derivatives contracts, including interest rate swaps and futures contracts. The
Eurodollar futures contract traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (âCMEâ) is one of the
largest futures contract in the world based on open interest and notional value of trading volume
and settles against U.S. Dollar LIBOR. Rates for consumer loans, such as mortgages, student
loans, car loans, and credit card accounts, are tied to LIBOR. Markets, investors and consumers
around the world rely on the integrity of these benchmark rates.

The benchmark rates are determined by contributions from select panel banks, including
Deutsche Bank, and are supposed to reflect each bankâs honest assessment of the costs of
borrowing unsecured funds in the cash markets. More than two dozen Deutsche Bank traders and
benchmark submitters violated this fundamental precept by focusing on the need to generate
trading profits instead of providing honest and accurate information to the relevant cash markets.
As aresult, Deutsche Bank routinely based its U.S. Dollar, Yen, Sterling, and Swiss Franc
LIBOR and Euribor submissions on its cash and derivatives trading positions, the profitability of
which were tied to LIBOR and Euribor. Through its regular, false LIBOR and Euribor
submissions, Deutsche Bank routinely attempted to manipulate LIBOR and Euribor in order to
ensure that the published rates for each benchmark benefited its trading positions. At times,
Deutsche Bank was successful in its attempts to manipulate LIBOR for U.S. Dollar, Yen,
Sterling, and Swiss Franc, and Euribor.

Over this more than six year period and across currencies, Deutsche Bankâs submitters
routinely took into account other Deutsche Bank tradersâ derivatives trading positions, as well as
their own cash and derivatives trading positions, when making the bankâs LIBOR and Euribor
submissions. On other occasions, Deutsche Bank aided and abetted other panel banksâ attempts
to manipulate Euribor and Yen LIBOR. The conduct of Deutsche Bankâs submitters, traders,
desk managers, and at least one senior manager was systemic and pervasive, occurring across

 
multiple trading desks and offices, including London, Frankfurt, New York, Tokyo,â and
Singapore.â

Allowing submitters and traders to prioritize profit motives over appropriate submission
considerations, Deutsche Bank permitted a culture of trader self-interest to exist and created
conflicts of interest, which allowed the misconduct to occur. Certain managers encouraged
continual information sharing between derivatives traders, money market traders, and submitters
for the various benchmarks, even restructuring business lines such that, in Deutsche Bankâs
London office, derivatives traders and submitters sat together. In addition to making routine
written requests for beneficial LIBOR and Euribor submissions, the traders often shouted their
requests for beneficial submissions across the trading floor to the submitters.â A senior managerâ
regularly sat with the traders and encouraged them and their counterparts in other offices to
communicate and exchange trading positions, so submitters became clearly aware of the
submissions that were most favorable to the various desksâ trading positions. Senior desk
managers in London, Frankfurt, New York, and in the Deutsche Tokyo Subsidiary also made
requests to benefit their own trading positions, facilitated the requests from their.traders for
beneficial submissions, and generally promoted the practice of inappropriately using benchmark
interest rate submissions to help the traders increase profits and minimize losses on their and the
deskâs trading positions. The cash and derivatives trading on the desks responsible for Deutsche
Bankâs misconduct increased throughout the relevant period and the desks generated significant
revenues for Deutsche Bank, particularly during the global financial crisis of 2007 through 2009.

Despite the obvious conflict of interest, Deutsche Bank, at times, allowed its traders who
primarily traded derivatives, such as its Yen derivatives trader, to be responsible for making its
submissions, thus making it easy to skew the bankâs submissions to benefit their own positions
and to accommodate the requests of their fellow derivatives traders.Â° These improper submission

Tokyo Subsidiaryâ). The Deutsche Tokyo Subsidiary is the brokerage and investment banking arm
located in Tokyo, Japan for Deutsche Bank AG. It is not registered with the Commission in any capacity.
> Deutsche Bankâs misconduct extended beyond the LIBOR and Euribor benchmarks. Through its
internal investigation, Deutsche Bank identified evidence of similar misconduct with respect to attempts
to influence, and at times attempts to manipulate, other interest rate benchmarks, including, but not
limited to, Singapore Interbank Offered Rate, Singapore Swap Offer Rate, and Tom/Next Indexed Swaps
for the Swiss Franc.

For purposes of this Order, the term ârequestâ means a request for a preferential LIBOR or Euribor
submission for a particular tenor.

5 . . :
The term âsenior managementâ or âsenior managerâ refers to Deutsche Bank employees with

responsibilities (formally or informally delegated) broader than the management of trading desks,
although their responsibilities may have at times included managing trading desks. The term âsenior
managementâ or âsenior managerâ does not include executive managers or members of Deutsche Bankâs
Management Board, Supervisory Board, or Group Executive Committee,

Â° In June 2008, the British Bankersâ Association (âBBAâ) clarified in guidance provided to panel banks
that the basis for a bankâs submission must be the rates at which bank staff members primarily
responsible for management of the bankâs cash, rather than the bankâs derivative trading book, consider

3

 
practices continued even after the BBA, the trade association responsible for the management
and publication of LIBOR, clarified in June 2008 that submissions should be made by those who
are responsible for management of the bankâs cash, rather than the bankâs derivatives trading
book. One particular Deutsche Bank derivatives trader-submitter used his position as the bankâs
submitter to assist the senior yen trader at UBS (âUBS Senior Yen Traderâ) in his massive
scheme to manipulate Yen LIBOR over the same relevant period.â

As a result of this profit-based submission process, improper written and oral submission
requests were common practice, and LIBOR and Euribor submitters routinely skewed Deutsche
Bankâs contributions, routinely made false submissions, and routinely attempted to manipulate,
and, at times, successfully manipulated LIBOR and Euribor. Thus, Deutsche Bankâs LIBOR and
Euribor submissions were not a reflection of Deutsche Bankâs honest assessment of the costs of
borrowing funds in the relevant interbank markets, as required by each of the benchmarksâ
definitions,

Deutsche Bankâs traders were able to accommodate and facilitate the attempts to
manipulate LIBOR and Euribor for years because Deutsche Bank lacked internal controls,
procedures and policies concerning its LIBOR and Euribor submission processes, and failed to
adequately supervise its trading desks and traders. Deutsche Bank did not have any policies,
internal controls, or procedures for determining or monitoring its submissions to ensure that
Deutsche Bankâs LIBOR and Euribor submissions reflected an honest assessment of the costs of -
borrowing unsecured funds in the interbank markets. Deutsche Bankâs failure to provide internal
training or implement standards addressing benchmark interest rate submissions, allowance of
inappropriate communications amongst traders and submitters, and related conflicts of interest
amplified the potential for misconduct and permitted the misconduct to continue for a number of
years. Deutsche Bank engaged in this wrongful conduct even after the Division of Enforcement
requested in April 2010 that Deutsche Bank conduct an internal investigation of its U.S. Dollar
LIBOR submission practices. In fact, Deutsche Bank did not make meaningful improvements in
its internal controls until mid-2011 and did not formalize a policy about conflicts of interest
among traders and submitters relating to benchmark submissions until February, 2013.

that the bank can borrow unsecured interbank funds in the London market. The BBA also clarified that
panel banks could not contribute a rate based on the pricing of any derivative financial instrument.

7 On December 19, 2012, the Commission issued an Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Sections

6(c) and 6(d) of the Commodity Exchange Act Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions
against UBS AG and UBS, finding, among other things, that UBS AG and UBS, through the UBS Senior
Yen Trader, attempted to manipulate Yen LIBOR, at times successfully, through multiple methods. The
Commissionâs Order found that one of the UBS Senior Yen Traderâs strategies included coordinating
with traders at other Yen panel banks, including Deutsche Bank, identified in the Order as the Yen Bank
F, to attempt to manipulate Yen LIBOR by making false Yen LIBOR submissions beneficial to their
respective derivatives trading positions. See In re UBS AG et al., CFTC Docket No. 13-09 (CFTC filed
December 19, 2012), available at
http:/Awww.cfite.gov/ucm/groups/public/@lrenforcementactions/documents/legalpleading/enfubsorder121

912.pdf.

 
In accepting Deutsche Bankâs Offer, the Commission recognizes Respondentâs
cooperation with the Division of Enforcementâs investigation of this matter. The Commission
notes that at the outset of the Division of Enforcementâs investigation in April 2010 and
continuing until mid-2011, Deutsche Bankâs cooperation was not sufficient, and, in part, this
affected a timely resolution of this matter. After mid-2011, Deutsche Bank provided significant
cooperation and assistance to the Division of Enforcement.

B. Respondent

Deutsche Bank AG is a German global banking and financial services company
headquartered in Frankfurt, Germany. Deutsche Bank operates in over 70 countries and has
offices in major financial centers including Frankfurt, London, New York City, Tokyo,
Singapore, and Hong Kong. On December 31, 2012, Deutsche Bank AG was provisionally
registered as a swap dealer with the Commission.

Cc. Facts
1. The Fixing of LIBOR and Euribor
a. LIBOR and its Fixing

LIBOR is the most widely used benchmark interest rate in the world and affects market
participants and consumers throughout the world, including in the United States. LIBOR is used
as a barometer to measure strain in money markets and is often a gauge of the marketâs
expectation of future central bank interest rates. LIBOR is used in interest rate transactions,
including loans, over-the-counter swaps, and exchange-traded interest rate futures and options
contracts on many of the worldâs major futures and options exchanges. For example, U.S. Dollar
LIBOR is used as the basis for settlement of the CMEâs Eurodollar futures contracts. The
products indexed to LIBOR have an approximate notional value of $500 trillion.

During the relevant period, under the auspices of the BBA,Â® LIBORs were issued on a
daily basis for ten currencies, including U.S. Dollar, Yen, Sterling, and Swiss Franc, with fifteen
tenors (i.e., durations for interest rates) ranging from overnight through twelve months.â Certain
currencies, such as U.S. Dollar, Yen, Sterling, and Swiss Franc are more widely referenced in
interest rate contracts. One, three and six-months are the most common tenors referenced in
LIBOR-indexed transactions.

According to the BBA, LIBOR âis based on offered inter-bank deposit rates contributed
in accordance with the Instructions to BBA LIBOR Contributor banks.â The BBA explained
that:

 

Â® On February 1, 2014, ICE Benchmark Administration Limited was appointed as the new

administrator for LIBOR, following authorization by the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (âFCAâ).

â âTn 2013, the BBA discontinued publication of LIBOR for five currencies, namely the Canadian

Dollar, Australian Dollar, New Zealand Dollar, Danish Krone, and Swedish Krona.

5

 
[a]n individual BBA LIBOR Contributor Panel Bank will contribute the rate at
which it could borrow funds, were it to do so by asking for and then accepting
inter-bank offers in reasonable market size just prior to [11:00 a.m. London
time].

Every business day shortly before 11:00 a.m. London time, the banks on the LIBOR
panels submitted their rates to Thomson Reuters. A trimmed averaging process excluded the top

and bottom quartile of rates and the remaining rates were averaged for each tenor. That averaged
rate became the official BBA daily LIBOR (the âLIBOR fixingâ) for each tenor.

The BBA made public the daily LIBOR fixing for each currency and tenor, as well as the
daily submissions of each panel bank, through Thomson Reuters and the other data vendors
licensed by the BBA. This information was made available and relied upon by market
participants and others throughout the world, including in the United States.

By its definition, LIBOR requires that the submitting panel banks exercise their judgment
to determine the rates at which they may obtain unsecured funds in the London interbank market.
These definitions require that submissions relate to funding and do not permit consideration of
factors unrelated to the costs of borrowing unsecured funds, such as the benefit to a bankâs
derivatives or money market trading positions.â!

b. Euribor and its Fixing

Euribor is used internationally in derivatives contracts, including interest rate swaps and
futures contracts.â* According to the Bank for International Settlements, over-the-counter
interest rate derivatives, such as swaps and FRAs, comprised contracts worth over $187 trillion
in notional value at the end of 2012,

During the relevant period, daily Euribors were issued on behalf of the European Banking
Federation (âEBFâ)? for fifteen tenors, ranging from one week to twelve months. One, three
and six months are the most common tenors referenced in Euribor-indexed transactions.

 

'Â° This definition of LIBOR has been used since 1998 to the present.
'! Tn June 2008, the BBA clarified that panel banks could not contribute a rate based on the pricing of
any derivative financial instrument. BBA guidelines issued in October 2009 further clarified that LIBOR
submitters âshould not ask intermediaries where they believe LIBOR rates will set on a given day and use
this as a basis for submissions, This misses the point of the benchmark, and is a circular process that
would rapidly lead to inaccurate rates.â

2 In October 2011, the CME launched the Euribor Futures contract, which settles based on the three-

month Euribor.

The EBF is an unregulated non-profit association of the European banking sector based in Brussels,

Belgium. Among other functions, the EBF oversees the publication of Euribor.

 
According to the EBF, Euribor is defined as the rate âat which Euro interbank term
deposits are offered by one prime bank to another prime bankâ within the Economic and
Monetary Union of the European Union (âEMUâ) at 11:00 a.m. Central European Time (âCETâ)
daily.

Euribor is determined using submissions from a panel of over 40 mostly European banks
considered to be the most active in the Euro zone with the highest volume of business in the
EMU. According to the EBF instructions, panel banks âmust quote the required euro rates to the
best of their knowledge,â based on their observations of where the Euro is trading in that market.

Like the BBA panel banks, the Euribor panel banks submit their rates electronically to
Thomson Reuters, which manages the official Euribor process by collecting the submitted rates
from the contributing banks, calculating the rate, and then releasing it for publication just before
noon CET. Thomson Reuters computes that dayâs published Euribor by eliminating the highest
and lowest fifteen percent of submissions collected, and averaging the remaining submissions.
That average rate becomes the official daily EBF Euribor (the âEuribor fixingâ). On behalf of
EBF, Thomson Reuters then issues the Euribor fixing and the submissions of each panel bank to
its subscribers and other data vendors. Through these licensing agreements with third parties,
such as Thomson Reuters, EBF disseminates the information throughout the world, including in
the United States,

He oe He oe Ho 2

By their definitions, LIBOR and Euribor require that the submitting panel banks exercise
their judgment to determine the rates at which, depending on the benchmark, they or a prime
bank may obtain unsecured funds in the respective London and Euro interbank markets, These
definitions require that submissions relate to funding and do not permit consideration of factors
unrelated to the costs of borrowing unsecured funds, such as cash or derivatives trading
positions,

2. Deutsche Bankâs LIBOR and Euribor Submission Processes and the Embedded
Conflicts of Interest

a. Deutsche Bankâs Submission Processes in London and Frankfurt

Deutsche Bank is a member of both the BBA and the EBF, and is one of the panel banks
that submits rates for the determination of LIBOR for various currencies, including U.S. Dollar,
Yen, Sterling, and Swiss Franc, and Euribor.ââ During the relevant period, Deutsche Bank made
its LIBOR submissions for U.S. Dollar, Sterling, and Yen out of its London office and made
Swiss Franc LIBOR and Euribor submissions out of its Frankfurt office. Deutsche Bankâs
LIBOR and Euribor submission processes and the traders and trading desks involved in this
misconduct were part of the Global Finance and Foreign Exchange Group (âGFFXâ).

 

'* During the relevant period, Deutsche Bank was also a member of the LIBOR panels for the Canadian

Dollar, Australian Dollar, Danish Krone, New Zealand Dollar, and, beginning in June, 2006, the Swedish
Krona.

 
Deutsche Bankâs GFFX Group consisted of two main lines of businesses, including
Global Finance and FX Forwards, Included in this group were Pool Trading desks and Money
Market Derivatives (ââMMDâ) desks. Deutsche Bankâs LIBOR and Euribor submitters sat on the
Pool Trading desks, where they traded both cash and derivatives trading products. While the
submitters and other pool traders regularly transacted in interbank cash deposits and loans to
meet the bankâs funding needs each day in all currencies, they also had their own derivatives
trading books that allowed them not only to hedge risk in their cash trading but also to generate
profits for the desk in a proprietary fashion. MMD traders, who also held proprietary books,
primarily traded derivatives trading products with a focus on short term maturities from
overnight to two years. Some of the derivatives products traded by both pool and MMD traders
included futures (including the CME Eurodollar futures contract), interest rate swaps, forward
rate agreements, overnight index swaps and tenor basis swaps. The cash and derivatives
positions held by the Deutsche Bank pool traders and MMD traders were often priced off of
LIBOR and Euribor. Some of these positions settled or reset on International Monetary Market
(âIMMâ) dates, which are quarterly dates in March, June, September, and December.

The Pool Trading and MMD desks were organized by currency and comprised of senior
traders who oversaw the desks and often trained junior traders. A regional manager in Deutsche
Bankâs Frankfurt and New York offices oversaw the business lines for that location, including
the Pool Trading and MMD desks. One senior manager located in London had global
responsibility for the Pool Trading and MMD desks (âGlobal Senior Managerâ). Prior to 2006,
the Pool Trading desks and MMD desks operated mostly independent of each other, despite their
overlapping trading responsibilities.

b. The LIBOR and Euribor Submittersâ Conflicts of Interest Created by
Deutsche Bank

In 2006, Deutsche Bank merged the Pool Trading and MMD desks in its bank branches
in an effort to increase the bankâs trading profits through an alignment of the desksâ related
trading positions. The merger of the business lines resulted in the MMD derivatives traders in
Deutsche Bankâs London office sitting next to, or in close proximity to, Deutsche Bank cash
traders. Some of those cash traders were the bankâs LIBOR submitters. From London, the
Global Senior Manager instructed all traders to have open communication across offices and
instilled an expectation that.the derivatives traders and submitters would communicate routinely
about relevant market conditions and individual trading positions.

This commingling of business lines caused a significant cultural shift within the bank
globally, where traders were incentivized to engage in improper communications with the bankâs
LIBOR and Euribor submitters. As a result, traders routinely communicated to submitters their
preferential requests for LIBOR and Euribor submissions which were beneficial to individual
and desk trading positions. Because the bankâs Euribor and Swiss Franc LIBOR submissions
were set in Frankfurt, the Global Senior Manager encouraged the Frankfurt Euribor and Swiss
Franc LIBOR submitters to contact derivatives traders in London to obtain the preferred rates to
submit each day. In addition to the pervasive oral requests, some of which were shouted across
the combined trading desks, submitters and traders routinely communicated on Bloomberg chat
terminals or internal Deutsche Bank messaging systems to discuss preferential LIBOR and

 
Euribor requests. The Global Senior Manager regularly sat amongst the traders on the trading
floor and was aware of the many oral and written requests for preferential LIBOR and Euribor
submissions.

Deutsche Bank further embedded this inherent conflict of interest in its Pool Trading
desks when it allowed its pool traders to fill dual roles as both submitters and derivatives traders.
This enabled submitters to prioritize their individual and the deskâs profits over their
responsibility to make honest assessment of the costs of borrowing unsecured funds when
submitting rates to the BBA and EBF. Not only did the submitters routinely take into account
the tradersâ preferential LIBOR and Euribor requests, the submitters also regularly and
improperly considered their own trading positions when determining their LIBOR and Euribor
submissions.

Deutsche Bankâs merger of Pool Trading and MMD desks proved successful and resulted
in significant profits for the bank. For example, throughout the relevant period, the Pool Trading
and MMD desks together utilized a basis spread trading strategy (7.e., trading the spread between
two or more tenors) to generate profits. By mid-2008, during the global financial crisis, rates
among the different tenors of LIBOR and Euribor began to widen dramatically. The Global
Senior Manager and the London manager of the MMD desks (âLondon MMD Managerâ), one of
the most senior, highly regarded and highly compensated derivatives traders at Deutsche Bank,âÂ°
recognized the basis spread trading strategy as a way to generate significant profits off of the
turbulent interest rate markets, and Deutsche Bankâs traders entered into massive derivatives
basis trading positions based upon the bet that the spread between tenors would continue to
widen.

The Global Senior Manager and other senior traders often discussed this strategy openly
during weekly meetings, ensuring that their strategy was well known and utilized across currency
desks in both Pool Trading and MMD. As a result, Deutsche Bankâs LIBOR and Euribor
submitters were aware of this strategy, particularly during the financial crisis, and were
cognizant of the particular LIBOR and Euribor submissions desired by traders to benefit those
positions based on this strategy. As such, the submitters routinely built this bias into Deutsche
Bankâs LIBOR and Euribor submissions, even in the absence of oral or written communications
from traders. Deutsche Bankâs Pool Trading and MMD desks posted tremendous profits during
2008 and 2009, at the height of the financial crisis, due in part to this trading strategy.'Â°

By failing to separate responsibilities for making LIBOR and Euribor submissions from
its trading functions, Deutsche Bank allowed an environment to exist that yielded significant
opportunities for traders and submitters to attempt to manipulate LIBOR and Euribor
submissions to the benefit of the bankâs trading positions, and the traders and submitters took full

 

> The London MMD Manager relocated to Deutsche Bankâs Singapore office in March 2010, where he

became the Global Manager of MMD.
'Â° In 2007, Deutsche Bankâs MMD desks reported trading revenue and commissions of â¬399 million
(1.29% of total bank revenue); in 2008, â¬1.942 billion (14.27% of total revenue); and in 2009, â¬992
million (3.55% of total revenue).

 
advantage of those opportunities. As a result, the submitters routinely skewed Deutsche Bankâs
LIBOR and Euribor submissions to benefit the bankâs trading positions by attempting to
manipulate the fixings of LIBOR and Euribor, At times, their attempts to manipulate U.S.
Dollar, Yen, Sterling, and Swiss Franc LIBOR and Euribor were successful.

3. Deutsche Bankâs Inadequate Internal Controls and Failure to Appreciate the
Scope of Misconduct

During the relevant period, Deutsche Bank allowed the conflicts of interest to flourish by
failing to put in place sufficient benchmark-specific systems or controls surrounding risk and
compliance to adequately supervise its derivatives traders and submitters. Deutsche Bank did
not have any policies, internal controls, or procedures for determining, monitoring, or
supervising its LIBOR and Euribor submissions to ensure that Deutsche Bankâs submissions
reflected an honest assessment of the costs of borrowing unsecured funds in the relevant
interbank markets. Deutsche Bankâs failure to provide internal training or standards addressing
benchmark interest rate submissions, allowance of inappropriate communications amongst
traders and submitters, and related conflicts of interest amplified the potential for misconduct and
permitted it to continue for over six years. Further, Deutsche Bank did not begin to put into
place any specific policies, procedures, or controls around its benchmark submission processes
until mid-2011, and the Bank did not formalize a policy addressing conflicts of interests between
traders and submitters for another two years, in February 2013.

In investigating the conduct at issue here, Deutsche Bank failed to appreciate until mid-
2011 the extent to which it had systemic and pervasive manipulative conduct by its traders and
managers across multiple lines of businesses in offices around the world. As a result, this
conduct continued well after the Division of Enforcement began its investigation of Deutsche
Bankâs U.S, Dollar LIBOR submissions in early 2010.

4. Deutsche Bankâs False Reporting, Attempted Manipulation, and Manipulation
of U.S. Dollar LIBOR

During the relevant period, Deutsche Bank, through its submitters and traders, routinely
made false U.S, Dollar LIBOR submissions in furtherance of its attempts to manipulate U.S,
Dollar LIBOR. At times, they were successful in their attempts to manipulate. This misconduct
originated primarily out of Deutsche Bankâs London offices, and at times, its New York and
Frankfurt offices.

The U.S. Dollar Pool Trading desk in London was responsible for submitting Deutsche
Bankâs U.S. Dollar LIBOR submissions. The head of the U.S. Dollar pool trading desk
(âLondon Pool Trading Managerâ) oversaw various junior traders who worked daily with him
and made the bankâs U.S. Dollar LIBOR submissions under his direction. Similar to the London
MMD Manager, the London Pool Trading Manager was a well-respected Deutsche Bank trader
and highly compensated. From 2004 throughout the rest of the relevant period, a trader
supervised by the London Pool Trading Manager (âU.S. Dollar LIBOR Submitterâ) became the
primary U.S. Dollar LIBOR submitter and, at times, the London Pool Trading Manager acted as
a back-up submitter,

10

 
During the relevant period, Deutsche Bank pool and MMD traders in London routinely
made requests to the U.S. Dollar LIBOR Submitter or the London Pool Trading Manager for
submissions that would benefit their derivatives trading positions. As described above, as a
result of the pool and MMD traders working side-by-side, this conduct was pervasive with
requests for beneficial U.S. Dollar LIBOR submissions being either shouted across the trading
floor, passed from one trader to another trader sitting next to the submitter, or sent to submitters
through electronic communications. On occasion, pool and MMD traders and managers in
Deutsche Bankâs New York office and at least one pool trader in Frankfurt also asked for LIBOR
submissions that benefited their positions. The U.S, Dollar LIBOR Submitter, at times,
contacted the pool and MMD traders in the various offices to solicit whether they had requests
for beneficial LIBOR submissions. The submitter resolved any conflicts between the requests by
first checking with the London Pool Trading Manager. The U.S. Dollar LIBOR Submitter
routinely accommodated the tradersâ requests in making Deutsche Bankâs U.S. Dollar LIBOR
submissions.

The U.S. Dollar LIBOR Submitter also acted as a trader but only occasionally traded his
own book. Rather, he worked closely with the London Pool Trading Manager and other pool
and MMD traders, and was expected to understand and be aware of their derivatives trading
positions. Over the relevant period, the submitter became so familiar with the trading positions
of the U.S. Dollar traders that he either informed the traders of his intent to submit a skewed
LIBOR without waiting for a request or he simply submitted U.S. Dollar LIBOR submissions in
a manner he believed would benefit their derivatives trading positions.

As described above, Deutsche Bank U.S. Dollar pool and MMD traders, particularly the
London Pool Trading Manager, utilized the basis spread trading strategy promoted by the Global
Senior Manager and the London MMD Manager. The U.S. Dollar LIBOR Submitter was clearly
aware of this trading strategy and, throughout the relevant period, but primarily during the global
financial crisis of 2008 through 2009, often skewed, without written or oral requests from
traders, Deutsche Bankâs U.S. Dollar LIBOR submissions in order to benefit the bankâs trading
positions based on this strategy. Deutsche Bankâs U.S. Dollar Pool and MMD trading desks
were some of the most highly profitable trading desks during this time.

Below are examples of the requests that numerous traders communicated to the U.S.
Dollar Submitter and the London Pool Trading Manager:""â

In addition to the LIBOR requests traders made to benefit specific trading positions,
traders also requested gradual movements in LIBOR in order to set the trend in upcoming
LIBOR fixings to benefit longer term derivatives trading positions, which the U.S. Dollar
LIBOR submitter routinely accommodated. Similarly, the U.S. Dollar LIBOR submitter was
also aware of month-end derivatives trading positions held by the traders and often submitted
Deutsche Bank U.S. Dollar contributions skewed to benefit those positions. The submitter
routinely accommodated these requests by skewing Deutsche Bankâs daily U.S. Dollar LIBOR
contributions at month-end, over a period of days, weeks, or even months. Below are examples

of such requests:

On a handful of occasions, either the London Pool Trading Manager or the U.S. Dollar
LIBOR submitter contacted interdealer brokers in attempts to influence the overall LIBOR fixing
by requesting the brokers to make preferential LIBOR predictions in specific tenors.'* Below are
examples of these communications:

Accordingly, throughout the relevant period, Deutsche Bank routinely made false reports
regarding U.S, Dollar LIBOR and attempted to manipulate U.S. Dollar LIBOR in order to
benefit Deutsche Bankâs trading positions. As such, Deutsche Bankâs U.S. Dollar LIBOR
submissions were not made in accordance with the BBA definitions and criteria for LIBOR
submissions, At times, they were successful in their attempted manipulations.

Brokers act as intermediaries between major dealers in the cash and derivatives markets to facilitate

of deposits and loans, and in hedging those transactions with derivatives trades often referenced to
LIBOR.

S. Deutsche Bankâs False Reporting, Attempted Manipulation, and Manipulation
of Euribor

Over the relevant period, Deutsche Bankâs Euribor submitters routinely skewed Euribor
submissions based upon requests from Deutsche Bank derivatives traders for rates set to benefit
derivatives trading positions that were linked to Euribor. The Frankfurt-based submitters also
routinely took their own trading positions into account in making the bankâs Euribor
submissions, In addition, Deutsche Bank derivatives traders coordinated on several occasions
with derivatives traders at other Euribor panel banks to ensure Euribor contributions benefited
their respective trading positions. Deutsche Bank routinely made false Euribor contributions in
furtherance of its attempts to manipulate Euribor. At times, Deutsche Bank was successful in its
attempts to manipulate Euribor.

The London MMD Manager made the majority of the tradersâ requests, although several
traders on multiple desks also made such requests. The London MMD Manager, Deutsche
Bankâs highly regarded senior trader, routinely used several means in his attempts to manipulate
the Euribor fixing. His approach to manipulating Euribor encompassed the following: (1) he
regularly requested Deutsche Bank's Frankfurt-based submitters to make Euribor submissions
beneficial to his derivatives trading positions; (2) he at times worked with the Euribor submitters
to make bids or offers in the market at rates intended to influence market perception of prevailing
cash rates (known as âpushing cashâ), and, thereby, potentially influence other banksâ Euribor
submissions; (3) he coordinated on several occasions with derivatives traders at other Euribor
panel banks by entering into agreements to make requests for preferential Euribor submissions to
their respective submitters; and (4) he coordinated with traders at other Euribor panel banks to
convince interdealer brokers to post false rates on their cash market screens for the purpose of
potentially influencing other banksâ Euribor submissions.

a. Deutsche Bankâs Internal Attempts to Manipulate Euribor in Order to
Benefit Trading Positions

Deutsche Bank assigned responsibility for making its Euribor submissions to traders and
managers on the Euro Pool Trading desk in Frankfurt. Among other duties, these pool traders
had responsibility for raising cash in Euro, Swiss France and other currencies, and traded Euro-
based interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements generally tied to various tenors of
Euribor.

The Euribor submitters, some of whom were desk managers, continued the systemic
practice of focusing on their derivatives trading positions as a basis for their Euribor
submissions. The submitters also maintained daily contact with MMD Euro traders in London,
including the London MMD Manager, to ensure they were aware of the bankâs various trading
positions tied to Euribor. Multiple traders regularly and openly made requests to the submitters

 

'? At least one of the traders on the Frankfurt Non-Euro Pool Trading Desk also had responsibility for

making the bankâs Euribor submissions, either as a back-up submitter or, as of mid-2010, as part of the
team of Euribor submitters. The Deutsche Bank Swiss Franc submitter(s) involved in the Euribor
conduct described here also routinely attempted to manipulate Swiss Franc LIBOR. See infra, pp. 32-35.

15

 
for Euribor submissions beneficial to their derivatives trading positions. When requests were not
forthcoming from London, the Euribor submitters actively solicited them from the traders as part
of their effort to coordinate the officesâ trading books and the bankâs Euribor submissions in a
manner to maximize their profits.

The Euribor submitters regularly accommodated these requests unless at times the
requests conflicted with their own needs for their derivatives trading positions. As the London
MMD Managerâs stature as a successful trader grew within the bank, his requests for beneficial
Euribor submissions often were accommodated over competing requests from other traders.
When the basis trading strategy implemented by the Global Senior Manager and the London
MMD Manager began to generate significant profits in mid-2008, the Euribor submitters
understood the Euribor submission(s) needed each day to benefit the spread positions and made
their Euribor submissions accordingly, even absent a specific request from traders,

The following are some examples of the many improper communications between the
Euribor submitters and the MMD Euro traders:

July 10, 2005: (emphasis added)

 

London MMD Manager: HI FRDS ANY CHANCE TO PUSH UP

Umm. Yeh, there's one thing. We have to be
careful. Usually we quote below Euribor,
and right now we usually quote around 4 to 5
basis points below the expected Kuribor just
to show that we are on the better quality of
the range of the contributors,

I see ...

So that's why, right now, tf you look at our
quote compared to the other contributors...

I know, I've been noticing that, that's why I
thought I would ask you if there is there any
chance if you can put it up for me. I would
really appreciate that. Just for tomorrow, ok?

apply trichets comments in the market i think

London MMD Manager: apart from lower Imth and higher 6m
pleaaaaaaaaaaaaase
Euribor Submitter: its likely that many contributors keep their rates
| unchanged :-) except for 1m and 6m of cause
-)

The Euribor submitters and the London MMD Manager also coordinated, at times, to
âpush cashâ in the market, or, in other words, make bids or offers in the market at rates other
than what they normally would have bid or offered. By this practice, the traders intended to
signal to other market participants (including other Euribor panel bank submitters) that market
prices were moving in a certain direction, The Deutsche Bank MMD traders and submitters
wanted the other banksâ Euribor submitters to factor these market moves into their Eurtbor
submissions, thereby increasing Deutsche Bankâs chances that the Euribor fixing would move in
the direction they desired.

The following are examples of the traders and the submitters openly discussing their
strategy of pushing cash in the market:

Frankfurt Euro Desk Manager: WE CONTINUE TO OFFER IM CASH IN
THE MARKTE TO KEEP 1ME FIX ON
THE LOW SIDE,

b. Deutsche Bankâs Coordination with Other Euribor Panel Banks to
Manipulate Euribor

From at least 2005 through at least 2008, the London MMD Manager coordinated with
derivatives traders at other Euribor panel banks on several occasions in attempts to manipulate
the Euribor fixing. In addition to his regular internal requests to Deutsche Bank Euribor
submitters, the London MMD Manager also utilized his friendships and past working
relationships with derivatives traders at other Eurtbor panel banks to further his attempts to
manipulate Euribor. While he spoke daily to traders at several banks and other financial

19

 
institutions, he primarily coordinated with derivatives traders at Barclaysââ (âBarclays Senior
Euro Swaps Traderâ) and at Euribor Bank A (âEuribor Bank A Swaps Traderâââ).

The London MMD Manager and these derivatives traders regularly exchanged
information about their derivatives trading positions and the Euribor fixing that they preferred to
benefit those positions. They agreed, at times, to transmit requests to their respective Euribor
submitters for Euribor submissions that would benefit their trading positions. They also
discussed reaching out to other Euribor panel banks to influence those banksâ Euribor
submissions in furtherance of their attempts to manipulate the Euribor fixings. When the
London MMD Manager was not available, he instructed the London MMD Euro Trader to
communicate his positions and Euribor preferences to at least the Barclays Senior Euro Trader or
his junior traders, and to the Deutsche Bank Euribor submitters.

The following are examples of the communications between the London MMD Manager
and the derivatives traders with whom he coordinated:

June 9, 2005: (emphasis added)
Bank A Euro Swaps Trader: Amigo checked with my FFT their 3m
euribor contribution which seems v low at

THE FRA/EONIA SPREADS

 

*Â° On June 27, 2012, the Commission issued an Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 6(c)

and 6(d) of the Commodity Exchange Act, As Amended, Making Findings and Imposing Remedial
Sanctions against Barclays, finding, among other things, that the London MMD Manager, identified in
the Barclays Order as Trader at Bank A, and a Barclays Senior Euro Swaps Trader coordinated in their
attempts to manipulate Euribor. See In re Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC and Barclays Capital Inc.,

London MMD Manager: seriously mate, are you really helping
[London MMD Euro Trader]
Barclays Senior Euro Swaps Trader: I'm going to help her big time

 

At times, the London MMD Manager and the derivatives traders at the other banks
attempted to manipulate Euribor to the benefit of their trading positions through the information
interdealer brokers provided to the market. They requested interdealer brokers to enter false
rates on the market screens the brokers provided to market participants in order to influence
market perception regarding prevailing cash rates. The traders believed that this could
potentially influence other banksâ Euribor submitters to make Euribor submissions that would
reflect these false rates, and, thereby, potentially move the Euribor fixing in a direction beneficial
to their respective trading positions,

The following are examples of the London MMD Managerâs discussions regarding
broker screens:

 

December 22, 2006:
Barclays Senior Euro Swaps Trader: tell [Broker 2] to raise the 6m mate important
London MMD Manager: yes yes

 

May 28, 2008: (telephone call to Barclays Euro Swaps Trader) (emphasis added)
London MMD Manager: Every day, every day I speak to my cash
desk, to the cash brokers. I say âYou have to
raise the six month, you have to raise the six
month!â

January 28, 2009: (in telephone call to another Euro derivatives trader)
London MMD Manager: ... we are still working on the, on the brokers
so that... they, they re-steepen the curve.

 

Accordingly, throughout the relevant period, Deutsche Bank routinely made false reports
regarding Euribor in attempts to manipulate Euribor in order to benefit Deutsche Bankâs trading
positions. As such, Deutsche Bankâs Euribor submissions were not made in accordance with the
EBFâs definitions and criteria for Euribor submissions. At times, they were successful in their
attempted manipulations of Euribor.

6. Deutsche Bankâs False Reporting, Attempted Manipulation, and Manipulation
of Yen LIBOR, and Coordination with UBS Senior Yen Trader

During the relevant period, Deutsche Bank, through its submitters and traders, routinely
made false submissions in attempts to manipulate Yen LIBOR. From mid-2008 through mid-
2010, one Deutsche Bank derivatives trader also routinely coordinated with a derivatives trader
at UBS in their attempts to manipulate Yen LIBOR. The Yen LIBOR misconduct perpetrated by
the Deutsche Bank traders and submitters originated out of Deutsche Bankâs London office
primarily, and, on occasion, out of the Deutsche Tokyo Subsidiary. At times, Deutsche Bank was
successful in its attempts to manipulate Yen LIBOR.

a. Deutsche Bankâs Attempts to Manipulate Yen LIBOR in Order to Benefit
Internal Trading Positions,

During the relevant period, several London-based Deutsche Bank traders handled the
responsibility for making the bankâs Yen LIBOR submissions, including the manager of the Yen
and Euro Pool Trading Desk (âYen Desk Managerââ) in London. Prior to mid-2008, the
submission process was handled by a senior Yen Pool trader (âSenior Yen LIBOR Submitterâ)
with a junior trader (âJunior Yen LIBOR Submitterâ) providing assistance.

The submitters on the Yen Pool Trading desk coordinated regularly with other Deutsche
Bank yen derivatives traders on MMD desks in London and, on occasion, with the Deutsche
Tokyo Subsidiary MMD traders, to make Yen LIBOR submissions that were beneficial to their
respective derivatives trading positions. One of the senior traders involved in making requests
on occasion was a manager in the Deutsche Tokyo Subsidiary (âTokyo Regional Managerâ).
One London-based MMD trader who made requests (âSenior Yen Trader-Submitterâ) eventually
became the Yen LIBOR submitter in mid-2008, further entrenching the inherent conflict of
interest permitted by Deutsche Bank.â

Over the relevant period, the Deutsche Bank Yen LIBOR submitters regularly took into
account the oral or written requests by Deutsche Bank traders for beneficial Yen LIBOR
submissions. The submitters even openly solicited requests. Although the Yen Desk Manager
usually did not make Yen LIBOR submissions himself, he was aware of the open and pervasive
LIBOR requests being made by traders and the accommodation of those requests by the
submitters. On occasion, he received the tradersâ requests and agreed to pass them along to the
submitters to ensure that the submissions matched the tradersâ needs.

The submitters also consistently took their own trading positions into account when
making LIBOR submissions on behalf of the bank, even communicating with each other when
out of the office to ensure that the submissions were made in accordance with their trading
positions. They also coordinated with other MMD traders to ensure their respective trading
positions were not in conflict when making submissions to benefit those positions. As the Senior

 

* Although the Senior Yen Trader-Submitter formally reported to other supervisors, his daily MMD

reporting supervisor was the London MMD Manager throughout the relevant period; with respect to his
Yen LIBOR submission duties, he reported to the Yen Desk Manager.

23

 
Yen Trader-Submitter stated to another trader, âON JPY WE TRY TO HAVE OUT LIBORS
WITH OUR POSITIONS NOT AGAINSJT].â This practice of making Yen LIBOR submissions
to benefit the various tradersâ cash and derivatives trading positions persisted as responsibility
for making the submissions passed from Senior Yen LIBOR Submitter to Senior Yen Trader-
Submitter to, finally, in mid-2010, the Yen Desk Manager.

LIBOR submitters and Yen traders:

b. Deutsche Bankâs Coordination with the UBS Senior Yen Trader to
Manipulate Yen LIBOR

From mid-2008 through mid-2010, the Senior Yen Trader-Submitter coordinated with a
senior yen derivatives trader at a subsidiary of UBS AG (âUBS Senior Yen Traderâ) regarding
Yen LIBOR submissions.ââ> The Senior Yen Trader-Submitter communicated regularly with the
UBS Senior Yen Trader, discussing the market and their relative trading positions, and,
eventually, discussing beneficial Yen LIBOR submissions. The Senior Yen Trader-Submitter
knew the UBS Senior Yen Trader to be highly active and successful, one who provided liquidity
and movement to the Yen derivatives market. When the UBS Senior Yen Trader began to
request his assistance in making Deutsche Bankâs Yen LIBOR submissions in a manner to

 

* In the Commissionâs Order against UBS, Deutsche Bankâs Senior Yen Trader-Submitter is identified

in the Order as the Yen Bank F Trader-Submitter.

25

 
benefit his trading, the Senior Yen Trader-Submitter readily accommodated him. The Senior
Yen Trader-Submitter knew his control over the bankâs Yen LIBOR submissions enabled him to
make submissions to benefit his and the UBS Senior Yen Traderâs derivatives trading positions.
The UBS Senior Yen Trader also offered to assist the Deutsche Bank submitter by having his
submitters make submissions that would benefit the Senior Yen Trader-Submitter. The traders at
times aligned their trading positions so they could each equally benefit from the altered Yen
LIBOR submissions made by both banks.â

The following are examples of the coordination of their attempts to manipulate Yen
LIBOR:

August 28, 2008: (emphasis added)
UBS Senior Yen Trader: look i appreciate the business and the calls we
should try to share info where possible also
let me know if you need fixes one way or the

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other

Senior Yen Trader-Submitter: sure sorry mate have to go too busy on many
things

UBS Senior Yen Trader: and i'll do the same if you have any joy with
your setters

Senior Yen Trader-Submitter: no prob

September 1, 2008:

senior Yen Trader-Submitter: [.. .] but going to put high libors today

UBS Senior Yen Trader: sure i think you guys are top in 1m anyways

Senior Yen Trader-Submitter: iam mate need it high!

September 18, 2008: (emphasis added)

UBS Senior Yen Trader: you got any ax on 6m fix tonight?

Senior Yen Trader-Submitter: absoluetly none but ican help

UBS Senior Yen Trader: can you set low as a favour for me?

Senior Yen Trader-Submitter: done

UBS Senior Yen Trader: ill return favour whenican just ask have
75mm jpy abp tonight

Senior Yen Trader-Submitter: np

UBS Senior Yen Trader: thanks so much

Senior Yen Trader-Submitter: [...] 73/90/99 am putting libors

UBS Senior Yen Trader: ereat thanks mate

 

 

** When aligning their positions, they also often discussed Euroyen TIBOR, or the Tokyo Interbank

Offered Rate, a Tokyo-based rate similar to LIBOR. Some of their derivatives trading positions were tied
to this rate. Both Deutsche Bank and UBS were banks who made submissions for this rate. On a few
occasions, the Senior Yen Trader-Submitter and the UBS Senior Yen Trader discussed trying to have
their respective submitters alter their TIBOR submissions to benefit their trading positions. The Senior
Yen Trader-Submitter even attempted internally on a handful of occasions, once at the behest of the UBS
Senior Yen Trader, to contact the Deutsche Bank TIBOR submitter. He was unsuccessful in his attempts.

26

 
In a follow-up message the next day, the UBS Senior Yen Trader offered the Senior Yen
Trader-Submitter a deal, stating, âin fact cause you helped me on 6m yday.â

May 21, 2009: (emphasis added)

UBS Senior Yen Trader: cld you do me a favour would you mind
moving you 6m libor up a bit today, i have a
gigantic fix iam limit short can't sell
anymore just watch

 

 

 

 

 

Senior Yen Trader-Submitter: ican do that
UBS Senior Yen Trader: thx
Follow-up message the next day:
Senior Yen Trader-Submitter: u happy with me yesterday?
UBS Senior Yen Trader: thx i don't see it going up again today
Senior Yen Trader-Submitter: me too
UBS Senior Yen Trader: only you and [Yen Panel Bank A] moved

 

In the summer of 2009, the UBS Senior Yen Trader began extended campaigns to
manipulate the six-month tenor of Yen LIBOR to benefit massive trading positions he held tied
to one-, three-, and six-month Yen LIBOR. His plan first required moving the six-month Yen
LIBOR fixing higher by the fixing date at the end of June, and then, second, to keep it high
through July. Finally, he wanted the six-month Yen LIBOR fixing to drop dramatically by mid-
August. To assist him, the Deutsche Bank Senior Yen Trader-Submitter became an active and
necessary participant in his plan. The UBS Senior Yen Trader also offered to enter into trades at
rates detrimental to him but beneficial to the Senior Yen Trader-Submitter to ensure the Senior
Yen Trader-Submitterâs involvement in his plans and to entice him to make Deutsche Bankâs
Yen LIBOR submissions in the manner he desired. The Senior Yen Trader-Submitter readily
accepted those trades and made the submissions as requested by the UBS Senior Yen Trader; at
times, he would ask the next day whether the UBS Senior Yen Trader was pleased with his
efforts.

The following are examples of their specific coordination to manipulate Yen LIBOR over
the summer of 2009:

June 15, 2009:
UBS Senior Yen Trader: is there any chance you cld set a high 6m
tonight, just tonight, i have 1..5m usd bp fix no
worries if you can't god knows where that all

 

came from

Senior Yen Trader-Submitter: hum i think my libors will be unch for a while
now....my led is quite high andido not want
3m libor up

UBS Senior Yen Trader: me neither ineedlow3m no probustnd you

 

will help me out when 6m goes over the turn
tho? ihave 1m usd a bp that day too

The Senior Yen Trader-Submitter continued to coordinate with the UBS Senior Yen
Trader regarding beneficial Yen LIBOR submissions into mid-2010, even after the UBS Senior
Yen Trader left UBS for another Yen panel bank. At this point, however, the Senior Yen Trader-
Submitter was no longer responsible for Deutsche Bankâs Yen LIBOR submissions.

Accordingly, throughout the relevant period, Deutsche Bank routinely made false reports
regarding Yen LIBOR and attempted to manipulate Yen LIBOR in order to benefit Deutsche
Bankâs trading positions. As such, Deutsche Bankâs Yen LIBOR submissions were not made in
accordance with the BBA definitions and criteria for LIBOR submissions. At times, they were
successful in their attempted manipulations of Yen LIBOR.

7. Deutsche Bankâs False Reporting, Attempted Manipulation, and Manipulation of
Sterling LIBOR

During the relevant period, Deutsche Bank, through its submitters and traders, routinely
made false LIBOR submissions in furtherance of their attempts to manipulate Sterling LIBOR.
At times, they were successful in their attempts. The head of Deutsche Bankâs Sterling Pool
Trading desk in London (âSterling Desk Managerâ) and another trader assigned to the desk
(âSterling LIBOR Submitterâ). were responsible for submitting Deutsche Bankâs Sterling LIBOR
submissions. Both traders maintained the deskâs trading book which included proprietary
derivatives trading positions. The secondary Sterling trader, acting as the primary Sterling
LIBOR submitter, communicated regularly, often daily, with the Sterling Desk Manager
regarding the trading positions held in the Sterling Pool trading book.

Throughout the relevant period, Deutsche Bankâs Sterling Desk Manager and the Sterling
submitter routinely took their LIBOR-based trading positions into account when determining the
bankâs Sterling LIBOR submissions, and, accordingly, made false Sterling LIBOR contributions
routinely in order to benefit those positions, On occasion, the Sterling Desk Manager and
Sterling submitter received preferential requests from at least one Sterling MMD derivatives
trader which they, at times, accommodated when making Deutsche Bankâs LIBOR submissions.
Throughout the relevant period, Deutsche Bankâs Sterling LIBOR submissions were routinely
skewed in order to benefit the Deutsche Bankâs Sterling LIBOR derivatives trading positions.
The following are examples of communications between the Sterling Desk Manager and Sterling
submitter, and the requests from the Sterling MMD trader:

December 5, 2006: (to Sterling Desk Manager) (emphasis added)
Senior MMD Sterling Trader: HI MATE IF WE COULD GO FOR A 28

But you need it, we need 3s to go to 76 and 77.

Accordingly, throughout the relevant period, Deutsche Bank routinely made false reports
regarding Sterling LIBOR in attempts to manipulate Sterling LIBOR in order to benefit Deutsche
Bankâs trading positions. As such, Deutsche Bankâs Sterling LIBOR submissions were not made
in accordance with the BBA definitions and criteria for LIBOR submissions. At times, they
were successful in their attempted manipulations of Sterling LIBOR.

8. Deutsche Bankâs False Reporting, Attempted Manipulation, and Manipulation
of Swiss Franc LIBOR

During the relevant period, Deutsche Bank, through its submitters and traders, routinely
made false submissions for Swiss Franc LIBOR in furtherance of its attempts to manipulate
Swiss Franc LIBOR. At times, they were successful in their attempts to manipulate Swiss Franc
LIBOR.

Deutsche Bankâs Swiss Franc LIBOR submissions were made by the Deutsche Bank
Non-Euro Pool Trading desk based in Frankfurt. The primary Swiss Franc LIBOR submitter

changed over the relevant period, one of whom was the Non-Euro Desk Manager.

Over the relevant period into 2010, one Swiss Franc Pool trader (Swiss Franc
Submitter 1) received from Deutsche Bank MMD derivatives traders in London, including the

32

 
Senior Yen Trader-Submitter, regular requests for preferential Swiss Franc LIBOR submissions
to benefit their derivatives trading positions. The Swiss Franc Submitter 1 routinely obliged
these trader requests and at times proactively reached out to the derivatives traders to ask
whether they had requests for that dayâs LIBOR submission. When the Swiss Franc Submitter |
was unavailable, the Non-Euro Desk Manager also adjusted Deutsche Bankâs Swiss Franc
LIBOR submissions to benefit the Senior Yen Trader-Submitter derivatives trading positions,

The Swiss Franc Submitter 1 was methodical in determining how submissions might
affect the Swiss Franc LIBOR submissions. During a telephone discussion between the Swiss
Franc Submitter 1 and the Senior Yen Trader-Submitter on August 19, 2009, the Swiss Franc
Submitter 1 explained that he maintained a spreadsheet in which he used a âLIBOR contribution
simulationâ to determine how a particular Deutsche Bank Swiss Franc LIBOR submission would
affect the Swiss Franc LIBOR fixing.

Examples of requests from the traders to the Swiss Franc Submitter 1 and the Non-Euro
Desk Manager are as follows:

March 26, 2007:
London MMD Swiss Franc Trader 1: hello sir, welcome back, you missed nothing,
not sure if matches with you but my int is for a

Later in mid-2010, the Swiss Franc Submitter 2 became responsible for Deutsche Bankâs
Swiss Franc LIBOR submissions. The Swiss Franc Submitter 2 often reached out to traders to
inform them of the bankâs intended Swiss Franc LIBOR submissions to determine whether there
any preferential rates needed by the derivatives traders. On occasion, the Swiss Franc
Submitter 2 received specific requests from MMD traders and skewed submissions to benefit
their trading positions. The Swiss Franc Submitter 2 continued this LIBOR. submission practice
until early 2011, more than a year after the start of the bankâs internal LIBOR investigation.
Examples of these communications are as follows:

September 9, 2010:

London MMD Swiss Franc Trader 2: Hi [Swiss Franc Submitter 2], good day to you.

Swiss Franc Submitter 2:

just to let you know if you can help..well or at
least dont kill on that one pls. Got quite big
fixings today: I am for: Lower fix in 1m higher
fix in 3m lower fix in6mtxs same tomorrow
in 6s3s and reverse monday...the beauty of
stupid mismatches

only helps you if relative to each other, right? 1
actually think a higher 3m fixing relative to 1m
and 6m would perfectly reflect market
movements today, should be no problem :-)

London MMD Swiss Franc Trader 2: i like your thinking! tks

34

 
Swiss Franc Submitter 2: won't have any effect though I'm just realizing.
my fixings are among the highest, they are not
counting into the average right now anyway

London MMD Swiss Franc Trader 2: haha, ok

Swiss Franc Submitter 2: sorry. I'm long :-)

 

 

September 22, 2010: (email to several Pool and MMD traders)
Swiss Franc Submitter 2: hi! libors unchanged today.

 

October 4, 2010:

London MMD Swiss Franc Trader 2: hello hello, so have u sorted when u coming
around? also, we re not the highest in fixings
anymore, do you think you could increase your
3m slightly from tomorrow on if suits
obviously.,,.bloody cs moved lower today and 1
m paid for the next 3 weeks or so

April 18, 2011: (email to several Pool and MMD traders)
Swiss Franc Submitter 2: hihi, chf libors unchanged please.

 

Accordingly, throughout the relevant period, Deutsche Bank routinely made false reports
regarding Swiss Franc LIBOR in attempts to manipulate Swiss Franc LIBOR in order to benefit
Deutsche Bankâs trading positions. As such, Deutsche Bankâs Swiss Franc LIBOR submissions
were not made in accordance with the BBA definitions and criteria for LIBOR submissions. At
times, they were successful in their attempted manipulations of Swiss Franc LIBOR.

ORR a oo a oe

As described above, Deutsche Bank made repeated and regular attempts to manipulate
U.S. Dollar, Yen, Sterling, and Swiss Franc LIBOR and Euribor in order to affect the official
fixings of LIBOR and Euribor in a manner that would benefit its cash and derivatives trading
positions. Deutsche Bank, through its derivatives traders and submitters, knew it was improper
to consider derivatives trading positions in determining the bankâs LIBOR and Euribor
submissions, A bankâs derivatives trading positions are not legitimate or permissible factors on
which to base a bankâs daily LIBOR or Euribor submissions. By basing its LIBOR and Euribor
submissions on rates that benefited Deutsche Bankâs derivatives trading positions, Deutsche
Bankâs submissions were not made in accordance with the definitions and criteria for LIBOR
and Euribor submissions. Instead, Deutsche Bank knowingly conveyed false, misleading, or
knowingly inaccurate reports that its submitted rates for LIBOR and Euribor were based on and
solely reflected its assessment of the costs of borrowing unsecured funds in the relevant
interbank money markets. Accordingly, Deutsche Bank regularly attempted to manipulate the
official fixings for U.S. Dollar, Yen, Sterling, and Swiss Franc LIBOR and Euribor, and
knowingly delivered false, misleading, or knowingly inaccurate reports concerning U.S. Dollar,
Yen, Sterling, and Swiss Franc LIBOR and Euribor, which are commodities in interstate
commerce.

IV.
LEGAL DISCUSSION

A. Deutsche Bank Made False, Misleading, or Knowingly Inaccurate Reports
Concerning the Costs of Borrowing Unsecured Funds in Violation of Section 9(a){2)
of the Act

Section 9(a)(2) of the Act makes it unlawful for any person âknowingly to deliver or
cause to be delivered for transmission through the mails or interstate commerce by telegraph,
telephone, wireless, or other means of communication false or misleading or knowingly
inaccurate reports concerning crop or market information or conditions that affect or tend to
affect the price of any commodity.in interstate commerce... .â 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13(a)(2) (2006);
United States v. Brooks, 681 F.3d 678, 691 (Sth Cir. 2012); United States v. Valencia, 394 F.3d
352, 354-355 (Sth Cir. 2004); see also CFTC y. Johnson, 408 F. Supp. 2d 259, 267 (S.D. Tex.
2005),

On a daily basis, Deutsche Bank knowingly delivered or caused to be delivered its U.S.
Dollar, Yen, Sterling, and Swiss Franc LIBOR and Euribor submissions through the mails or
interstate commerce by transmitting its submissions electronically to the service provider of the
BBA and EBF, who calculates their official fixings (7.e., Thomson Reuters), Deutsche Bankâs
submissions were also caused to be delivered through the mails or interstate commerce through
the daily dissemination and publication globally, including into the United States, of the panel
banksâ submissions, as well as the daily official benchmark interest rates, by at least Thomson
Reuters on behalf of the BBA and EBF, and by other third party vendors. The panel banksâ
submissions are used to determine the official published rates for LIBOR and Euribor, which are
calculated based on a trimmed average of the submissions. Deutsche Bankâs daily LIBOR and
Euribor submissions contained market information concerning the costs of borrowing unsecured
funds in particular currencies and tenors, the liquidity conditions and stress in the money
markets, and Deutsche Bankâs ability to borrow funds in the particular markets, Such market
information affects or tends to affect the prices of commodities in interstate commerce, including
the daily rates at which U.S. Dollar, Yen, Sterling, and Swiss Franc LIBOR and Euribor are
fixed,

During the relevant period, Deutsche Bankâs submissions for U.S. Dollar, Yen, Sterling,
and Swiss Franc LIBOR and Euribor were false, misleading, or knowingly inaccurate because
they were based in whole or in part on impermissible and illegitimate factors, specifically
Deutsche Bankâs cash and derivatives trading positions. By using these impermissible and
illegitimate factors in making its LIBOR and Euribor submissions, Deutsche Bank conveyed
false, misleading, or knowingly inaccurate information that the rates it submitted were based on
and related solely to the costs of borrowing unsecured funds in the relevant interbank markets,
and were truthful and reliable. Moreover, certain of Deutsche Bankâs traders, submitters, and

 

*5 LIBOR and Euribor as benchmark interest rates are commodities under the Act. See Sections 1a(4)

and 1a(13) of the Act, 7 U.S.C, Â§Â§ 1a(4) and 1a(13) (2006) (pre-Dodd Frank) and Sections 1a(9) and
la(19) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1a(9) and La(19) (2012) (post-Dodd Frank).

managers, including a senior manager, knew that Deutsche Bankâs U.S. Dollar, Yen, Sterling,
and Swiss Franc LIBOR and Euribor submissions contained false, misleading and knowingly
inaccurate information concerning the submitted rates. By such conduct, Respondent violated
Section 9(a)(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13(a)(2) (2006).

B. Deutsche Bank Manipulated U.S. Dollar LIBOR, Euribor, Yen LIBOR, Sterling
LIBOR, and Swiss France LIBOR at Times for Certain Tenors

Together, Sections 6(c), 6(d), and 9(a)(2) of the Act prohibit acts of manipulation or
attempted manipulation. Section 9(a)(2) of the Act makes it unlawful for â[a]ny person to
manipulate or attempt to manipulate the price of any commodity in interstate commerce, or for
future delivery on or subject to the rules of any registered entity... .â 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13(a)(2)
(2006). Section 6(c) of the Act authorizes the Commission to serve a complaint and provide for
the imposition of, among other things, civil monetary penalties and cease and desist orders if the
Commission âhas reason to believe that any person... is manipulating or attempting to
manipulate or has manipulated or attempted to manipulate the market price of any commodity, in
interstate commerce, or for future delivery on or subject to the rules of any registered entity, . . .
or otherwise is violating or has violated any of the provisions of [the] Act... .â 7 U.S.C. Â§9
(2006). Section 6(d) of the Act is substantially identical to Section 6(c). See 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13b
(2006).

Manipulation under the Act is the âintentional exaction of a price determined by forces
other than supply or demand.â Frey v. CFTC, 931 F.2d 1171, 1175 (7th Cir. 1991), The
following four elements must be met, by a preponderance of the evidence, to show a successful
manipulation has occurred:

(1) the [respondent] had the ability to influence market prices;
(2) the [respondent] specifically intended to do so;

(3) artificial prices existed; and

(4) the [respondent] caused an artificial price.

Inre Cox, [1986-1987 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L, Rep, (CCH) 4 23,786, at 34,061
(CFTC July 15, 1987). The test for manipulation, however, is a practical one:

We think the test of manipulation must largely be a practical one if the
purposes of the Commodity Exchange Act are to be accomplished. The
methods and techniques of manipulation are limited only the ingenuity of
man. The aim must be therefore to discover whether conduct has been
intentionally engaged in which has resulted in a price which does not
reflect basic forces of supply and demand.

Cargill v. Hardin, 452 F.2d 1154, 1163 (8th Cir. 1971).
ââ[I|ntent is the essence of manipulation.â Indiana Farm Bureau Cooperative Assân, Inc.,

[1982-1984 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep (CCH) 4 21,796, at 27,282 (CFTC Dec. 17,
1982). The manipulatorâs intent separates âlawful business conduct from unlawful manipulative

37

 
activity.â /d. at 27,283. To prove the intent element of manipulation, it must be shown that
Deutsche Bank âacted (or failed to act) with the purpose or conscious object of causing or
effecting a price or price trend in the market that did not reflect the legitimate forces of supply
and demand.â Id.

The Commission has observed that âintent must of necessity be inferred from the
objective facts and may, of course, be inferred by a personâs actions and the totality of the
circumstances.â Jn re Hohenberg Bros., [1975-1977 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep.
(CCH) 4 20,271, at 21,477 (CFTC Feb. 18, 1977). â[O]nce it is demonstrated that the alleged
manipulator sought, by act or omission, to move the market away from the equilibrium or
efficient price â the price which reflects market forces of supply and demand â the mental
element of manipulation may be inferred.â Indiana Farm Bureau Cooperative Assân, Inc.,
[1982-1984 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep (CCH) at 27,283. âIt is enough to present
evidence from which it may reasonably be inferred that the accused âconsciously desire[d] that
result, whatever the likelihood of that result happening from his conduct.ââ Jd. (quoting United
States yv. United States Gypsum Co., 438 U.S. 442, 445 (1978)). A profit motive may also be
evidence of intent, although profit motive is not a necessary element of an attempted
manipulation. See In re DiPlacido, [2007-2009 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) 4
30,970, at 62,484 (CFTC Nov. 5, 2008) (citing In re Hohenberg Bros, Co., Comm. Fut. L. Rep.
(CCH) { 20,271, at 21,478)), aff'd, 364 Fed. Appx. 657, No. 08-5559-ag, 2009 WL 3326624 (2d
Cir, 2009),

An artificial price (also termed a âdistortedâ price) is one âthat does not reflect market or
economic forces of supply and demand.â Jn re Cox, [1986-1987 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L.
Rep. (CCH) at 34,064; Indiana Farm Bureau Cooperative Ass'n, Inc., [1982-1984 Transfer
Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep (CCH) at 27,288 n. 2. As the Commission noted with approval in
DiPlacido, { 30,970, at 62,484 (quoting Indiana Farm Bureau Cooperative Ass'n, Inc., [1982-
1984 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep (CCH) at 27,300 (Commissioner Stone concutring)),
a Commissioner has commented: â[t]his is more an axiom than a test.â In determining whether
an artificial price has occurred:

[O|ne must look at the aggregate forces of supply and demand and search
for those factors which are extraneous to the pricing system, are not a
legitimate part of the economic pricing of the commodity, or are extrinsic
to that commodity market. When the aggregate forces of supply and
demand bearing down on a particular market are all legitimate, it follows
that the price will not be artificial. On the other hand when a price is
effected by a factor which is not legitimate, the resulting price is
necessarily artificial. Thus, the focus should not be as much on the
ultimate price as on the nature of the factors causing it.

Indiana Farm Bureau Cooperative Assân, Inc., [1982-1984 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep
(CCH) at 27,288 n.2. See also In re DiPlacido, [2007-2009 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L.
Rep. (CCH) at 62,484 (finding that the placement of uneconomic bids or offers results in
artificial prices because those prices are not determined by the free forces of supply and demand
on the exchange).

38

 
Causation of artificial prices is established when it is demonstrated that artificial market
prices resulted from the conduct of a trader, or group of traders acting in concert, rather than
legitimate forces of supply and demand. See Cargill, Inc. v. Hardin, 452 F.2d 1154, 1171-72
(8th Cir. 1971) (price squeeze âintentionally brought about and exploited by Cargillâ); In re Cox,
[1986-1987 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) at 34,067 (proof of causation requires
the Division to show that âthe respondentsâ conduct âresulted inâ artificial pricesâ).

There can be multiple causes of an artificial price. In re DiPlacido, [2007-2009 Transfer
Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) at 62,485. The manipulatorâs actions need not be the sole
cause of the artificial price. âIt is enough for purposes of a finding of manipulation in violation
of Sections 6(b) and 9 of the Act that respondentsâ action contributed to the price [movement].â
In re Kosuga, 19 A.D. 603, 624 (1960); see also In re Cox, [1986-1987 Transfer Binder] Comm,
Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) at 34,066 (recognizing there can be multiple causes of an artificial price and
holding that a charge of manipulation can be sustained where respondentsâ acts are a proximate
cause of the artificial price).

Here, as a member of the BBAâs U.S. Dollar, Yen, Sterling, and Swiss Franc LIBOR
panels and the Euribor panel, Deutsche Bank made daily submissions that purported to reflect its
assessments of the costs of borrowing unsecured funds in the relevant interbank markets for U.S.
Dollar, Yen, Sterling, Swiss Franc, and Euro across tenors. The official LIBOR and Euribor
fixings are calculated using a trimmed average methodology applied to the rates submitted by the
panel banks. By virtue of this methodology, Deutsche Bank had the ability to influence or affect
the rates that would become the official fixings for U.S. Dollar, Yen, Sterling, and Swiss Franc
LIBOR and Euribor for any tenor.

As evidenced by the extensive communications and other facts set forth above, in making
the false LIBOR and Euribor submissions, more than two dozen Deutsche Bank traders,
submitters, and managers specifically intended to affect the daily U.S. Dollar, Yen, Sterling, and
Swiss Franc LIBOR and Euribor for certain tenors, including one-month, three-month, and six-
month. Their intent is also made clear by the evidence that the derivatives traders and
submittersâ motives were to benefit Deutsche Bankâs derivatives and at times cash trading
positions, or, at times, the derivatives trading positions of other panel banks with whom certain
Deutsche Bank derivatives traders coordinated.

On certain occasions, Deutsche Bankâs false, misleading, or knowingly inaccurate
LIBOR and Euribor submissions were illegitimate factors in the pricing of the daily LIBOR and
Euribor fixings and affected the official LIBOR and Euribor for certain tenors, resulting in
artificial LIBOR and Euribor fixings. Thus, Deutsche Bankâs actions were a proximate cause of
the artificial LIBOR and Euribor fixings.

Accordingly, at times, Deutsche Bank manipulated certain tenors of U.S. Dollar, Yen,
Sterling, and Swiss Franc LIBOR and Euribor, commodities in interstate commerce, in violation
of Sections 6(c), 6(d), and 9(a)(2) of the Act.

39

 
C. Deutsche Bank Attempted to Manipulate U.S. Dollar, Yen, Sterling, and Swiss
Franc LIBOR and Euribor

To prove attempted manipulation, two elements are required: (1) an intent to affect the
market price; and (2) an overt act in furtherance of that intent. See Jn re Hohenberg Bros. Co.,
[1975-77 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) 4 20,271, at 21,477 (CFTC Feb. 18,
1977); CFTC y. Bradley, 408 F. Supp. 2d 1214, 1220 (N.D. Okla. 2005). The intent standard is
the same as that for manipulation. See Indiana Farm Bureau and Hohenberg Bros., supra.

As found above, more than two dozen Deutsche Bank derivatives traders, submitters, and
managers specifically intended to affect the rate at which the daily LIBOR for U.S. Dollar, Yen,
Sterling, and Swiss Franc and the daily Euribor would be fixed to benefit Deutsche Bankâs
derivatives trading and, at times, money market positions, or, in the case of Euribor and Yen
LIBOR, to benefit the derivatives trading positions of traders at other banks with whom certain
Deutsche Bank traders coordinated. The Deutsche Bank derivatives tradersâ requests for
beneficial LIBOR and Euribor submissions and the Deutsche Bank submitters making
submissions based on those requests, or making submissions to benefit their own derivatives
trading positions, constitute overt acts in furtherance of their intent to affect the fixings of
LIBOR for various currencies and the fixings of Euribor. By doing so, Deutsche Bank engaged
in repeated acts of attempted manipulation in violation of Sections 6(c), 6(d), and 9(a)(2) of the
Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 9, 13b, and 13(a)(2) (2006).

D. Deutsche Bank Aided and Abetted the Attempts of Traders at Other Banks to
Manipulate Yen LIBOR and Euribor

Pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Act, Deutsche Bank aided and abetted the attempts of
traders at other banks to manipulate Yen LIBOR and Euribor in violation of the Act. 7 U.S.C,
Â§ 13c(a) (2006), Liability as an aider and abettor requires proof that: (1) the Act was violated;
(2) the aider and abettor had knowledge of the wrongdoing underlying the violation; and (3) the
aider and abettor intentionally assisted the primary wrongdoer. See In re Nikkhah, [1999-2000
Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) f 28,129, at 49,888 n.28 (CFTC May 12, 2000).
Although actual knowledge of the primary wrongdoerâs conduct is required, knowledge of the
unlawfulness of such conduct need not be demonstrated. See Jn re Lincolnwood Commodities,
Inc., [1982-1984 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) 4 21,986, at 28,255 (CFTC Jan.
31, 1984). Knowing assistance can be inferred from the surrounding facts and circumstances.
Id.

As evidenced by the communications set forth above, Deutsche Bankâs Senior Yen
Trader-Submitter and London MMD Manager and derivatives traders at other panel banks
coordinated on several occasions about Yen LIBOR and Euribor submissions that would benefit
their banksâ respective cash and derivatives trading positions. At times, the traders at the other
panel banks asked Deutsche Bank traders to submit a certain rate, or submit a rate in a direction
higher or lower, that would benefit the cash and derivatives trading positions of the traders at the
other panel banks. The Deutsche Bank Senior Yen Trader-Submitter agreed and submitted the
requested preferential rates for Yen LIBOR. The London MMD Manager also agreed and
passed along the requested Euribor submissions to Deutsche Bankâs Euribor submitters, who

40

 
accommodated the requests. Accordingly, by seeking to affect the rates at which Yen LIBOR
and Euribor were fixed, traders at the other banks attempted to manipulate Yen LIBOR and
Euribor in violation of Sections 6(c), 6(d), and 9(a)(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 9, 13b, and
13(a)(2) (2006). Deutsche Bankâs Senior Yen Trader-Submitter and London MMD Manager
had knowledge of and intentionally assisted the attempts of the traders at the other banks to
manipulate the rates at which Yen LIBOR and Euribor were fixed. By such acts of those
Deutsche Bank employees, Deutsche Bank aided and abetted the attempts of traders at other
banks to manipulate Yen LIBOR and Euribor in violation of Sections 6(c), 6(d), and 9(a)(2) of
the Act, 7 U.S.C, Â§Â§ 9, 13b, and 13(a)(2) (2006),

KE. Deutsche Bank is Liable for the Acts of Its Agents

Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(a)(1)(B), and Regulation 1.2, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.2
(2012), provide that the act, omission, or failure of any official, agent, or other person acting for
any individual, association, partnership, corporation, or trust within the scope of his employment
or office shall be deemed the act, omission, or failure of such individual, association, partnership,
corporation, or trust. Pursuant to Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the CEA and Commission Regulation
1,2, strict liability is imposed on principals for the actions of their agents. See, e.g., Rosenthal &
Co. v. CFTC, 802 F.2d 963, 966 (7th Cir. 1986); Dohmen-Ramirez & Wellington Advisory, Inc.
v. CFTC, 837 F.2d 847, 857-58 (9th Cir, 1988).

Deutsche Bank is liable for the acts, omissions, and failures of the traders, managers, and
submitters who acted as its employees and/or agents in the conduct described above and
accordingly, violated Sections 6(c), 6(d), and 9(a)(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 9, 13b, and 13(a)(2)
(2006), as set forth above.

V.

b. Third party offers in other markets for unsecured funds,
including, but not limited to, certificates of deposit and
issuances of commercial paper, provided to Respondent by
interdealer brokers (e.g., voice brokers); and

c. Third party offers provided to Respondent in various
related markets, including, but not limited to, Overnight
Index Swaps, foreign currency forwards, repurchase
agreements, and Fed Funds.

x Adjustments and Considerations: All of the following
Adjustments and Considerations may be applied with respect to
each of the Factors above:

a. Time: With respect to the Factors considered above,
proximity in time to the Submission(s) increases the
relevance of that Factor;

b. Market Events: Respondent may adjust its Submission(s)
based upon market events, including price variations in
related markets, that occur prior to the time at which the
Submission(s) must be made to the Benchmark Publisher.
That adjustment shall reflect measurable effects on
transacted rates, offers or bids;

c. Term Structure: As Respondent applies the above Factors,
if Respondent has data for any maturity/tenor described by
a Factor, then Respondent may interpolate or extrapolate
the remaining maturities/tenors from the available data;

d. Credit Standards: As Respondent applies the above
Factors, adjustments may be made to reflect Respondentâs
credit standing and/or the credit spread between the market
as defined by the Benchmark Publisher and transactions or
offers in the related markets used in the Factors above.

Additionally, Respondent may take into account
counterpartiesâ credit standings, access to funds, and
borrowing or lending requirements, and third party offers
considered in connection with the above Factors; and

e. Non-representative Transactions: To the extent a
transaction included among the Factors above significantly
diverges in an objective manner from other transactions,
and that divergence is not due to market events as
addressed above, Respondent may exclude such
transactions from the determination of its Submission(s).

SUPERVISOR(S) REVIEW: Effective within fourteen (14) days of the
entry of this Order, each daily Submission shall be reviewed by a
Supervisor on a daily basis after the Submission(s) are made to the
Benchmark Publisher.

QUALIFICATIONS OF SUBMITTER(S) AND SUPERVISOR(S): All

 

Submitter(s) shall have significant experience in the markets for the
Benchmark Interest Rate to which they are submitting or a comparable
market, but may designate less experienced parties, who routinely work
under their supervision, to make Submission(s) during limited periods of
absence. All Supervisors shall have significant experience in the markets
for the relevant Benchmark Interest Rate or a comparable market.
Submitters, Supervisors and any parties designated to make Submission(s)
when the Submitter(s) are absent shall not be assigned to any derivatives
trading desk, unit or division within Respondent, or participate in
derivatives trading other than that associated with Respondentâs liquidity
and liability management. The compensation of Submitter(s) and

54

 
3. DEVELOPMENT OF RIGOROUS STANDARDS FOR BENCHMARK
INTEREST RATES

To the extent Respondent is or remains a contributor to any Benchmark Interest
Rate, Respondent agrees to make its best efforts to participate in efforts by current
and future Benchmark Publishers, other price reporting entities and/or regulators
to ensure the reliability of Benchmark Interest Rates, and through its participation
to encourage the following:

1.

ii,

iil.

iv.

METHODOLOGY: Creating rigorous methodologies for the contributing
panel members to formulate their Submissions. The aim of such
methodologies should be to result in a Benchmark Interest Rate that
accurately reflects the rates at which transactions are occurring in the
market being measured by that Benchmark Interest Rate;

 

VERIFICATION: Enforcing the use of those methodologies through an
effective regime of documentation, monitoring, supervision and auditing,
required by and performed by the Benchmark Publishers, and by the
contributing panel members internally;

INVESTIGATION: Facilitating the reporting of complaints and concerns
regarding the accuracy or integrity of Submissions to Benchmark Interest
Rates or the published Benchmark Interest Rate, and investigating those
complaints and concerns thoroughly;

 

DISCIPLINE: Taking appropriate action if, following a thorough
confidential investigation, the Benchmark Publisher determines that a
complaint or concern regarding the accuracy or integrity of a Submission
or the published Benchmark Interest Rate has been substantiated;

TRANSPARENCY: Making regular reports to the public and the markets
of facts relevant to the integrity and reliability of each Benchmark Interest
Rate. Such reports should include, but not be limited to, the following:

 

x At the time each Benchmark Interest Rate is published, the
Benchmark Publisher should display prominently whether each
rate is based entirely on transactions in the market the rate is
supposed to reflect, or whether it instead is based, in whole or in
part, on other data or information;

# The Benchmark Publisher also should make periodic reports
regarding the number and nature of complaints and concerns
received regarding the accuracy or integrity of Submissions or the
published Benchmark Interest Rate while maintaining the
anonymity of all those who have reported or are the subject of
complaints and concerns;

55

 
V1.

# The Benchmark Publisher should additionally make periodic
reports regarding the results of all investigations into such
complaints and concerns while maintaining the anonymity of all
those involved in investigations that have not yet been completed;
and

FORMULATION: Periodically examining whether each Benchmark
Interest Rate accurately reflects the rate at which transactions are
occuring in the market being measured (using the statistical method
prescribed by that Benchmark Interest Rate), and evaluating whether the
definition and instructions should be revised, or the composition of the
panel changed;

Such examinations should include a rigorous mathematical comparison of
transactions in the relevant market with the published Benchmark Interest
Rate on the same day over a specified period and a determination of
whether any differences are statistically or commercially significant.

Every four (4) months, starting 120 days from the entry of this Order, Respondent
shall report to the Commission, through the Division, either orally or in writing,
on its participation in such efforts, to the extent that such reporting is not
otherwise prohibited by law or regulations, by the rules issued by Benchmark
Publishers, or by nondisclosure agreements by and between Respondent and
Benchmark Publishers.

4, COOPERATION WITH THE COMMISSION

i,

Respondent shall cooperate fully and expeditiously with the Commission,
including the Division, and any other governmental agency in this action,
and in any investigation, civil litigation or administrative matter related to
the subject matter of this action or any current or future Commission

proceeding, or Commission investigation related to the subject
matter of this proceeding, including, but not limited to, requests for
testimony, depositions, and/or interviews, and to encourage them
to testify completely and truthfully in any such proceeding, trial, or
investigation; and

# Subject to applicable laws and regulations, Respondent will make
its best efforts to assist in locating and contacting any prior (as of
the time of the request) officer, director, employee, or agent of
Respondent;

ii. Respondent also agrees that it will not undertake any act, other than as
required by applicable law, which would limit its ability to cooperate fully
with the Commission. Respondent will designate an agent located in the
United States of America to receive all requests for information pursuant
to these Undertakings, and shall provide notice regarding the identity of
such Agent to the Division upon entry of this Order. Should Respondent
seek to change the designated agent to receive such requests, notice of
such intention shall be given to the Division fourteen (14) days before it
occurs. Any person designated to receive such request shall be located in
the United States of America; and

ill. Respondent and the Commission agree that nothing in these Undertakings
shall be construed so as to compel Respondent to continue to contribute
Submission(s) related to any Benchmark Interest Rate. Without prior
consultation with the Commission, Respondent remains free to withdraw
from the panel of contributors to any Benchmark Interest Rate.

5. PROHIBITED OR CONFLICTING UNDERTAKINGS

of any obligations imposed on Respondent by any presently existing, or
hereinafter enacted or promulgated laws, regulations, regulatory mandates, or the
rules or definitions issued by a Benchmark Publisher, then Respondent shall
promptly transmit notice to the Commission (through the Division) of such

37

 
prohibition or conflict, and shall meet and confer in good faith with the
Commission (through the Division) to reach an agreement regarding possible
modifications to the Undertakings herein sufficient to resolve such inconsistent
obligations. In the interim, Respondent will abide by the obligations imposed by
the law, regulations, regulatory mandates and Benchmark Publishersâ rules and
definitions. Nothing in these Undertakings shall limit, restrict or narrow any
obligations pursuant to the Act or the Commission Regulations promulgated
thereunder, including but not limited to Regulations 1.31 and 1.35, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§
1.31 and 1.35 (2014), in effect now or in the future.

employees under its authority or control shall take any action or make any public
statement denying, directly or indirectly, any findings or conclusions in this Order
or creating, or tending to create, the impression that this Order is without a factual
basis; provided, however, that nothing in this provision shall affect Respondentâs
(i) testimonial obligations, or (i1) right to take legal positions in other proceedings
to which the Commission is not a party. Respondent and its successors and
assigns shall undertake all steps necessary to ensure that all of its agents and/or
employees under its authority or control understand and comply with this
agreement.

E, Partial Satisfaction: Respondent understands and agrees that any acceptance by the

Deutsche Bank to Pay $800 Million Penalty to Settle CFTC Charges of Manipulation,
Attempted Manipulation, and False Reporting of LIBOR and Euribor

The Fine Imposed on Deutsche Bank Represents the Largest Fine in
CFTCâs History

With Todayâs Action, the CFTC Has Imposed over $4 Billion in Penalties
against 13 Banks and Brokers to Address LIBOR and FX Benchmark
Abuses

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today issued an Order against Deutsche
Bank AG (Deutsche Bank) bringing and settling charges that Deutsche Bank routinely engaged in acts of false reporting
and attempted manipulation and, at times, succeeded in manipulating the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) for
U.S. Dollar, Yen, Sterling, and Swiss Franc, and the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (Euribor), interest rate benchmarks
critical to the U.S. and global financial markets. Deutsche Bank is also charged with aiding and abetting, at times, the
attempts of traders at other banks to manipulate Yen LIBOR and Euribor. The CFTC Order finds that Deutsche Bank,
through its traders and benchmark submitters, engaged in this manipulative conduct to benefit cash and derivatives
trading positions that were priced off of LIBOR or Euribor.

This Order requires Deutsche Bank to pay a civil monetary penalty of $800 million, cease and desist from its violations of
the Commodity Exchange Act, and adhere to specific undertakings to ensure the integrity of its LIBOR and Euribor and
other benchmark interest rate submissions in the future.

Aitan Goelman, CFTC Director of Enforcement, commented: âTodayâs action against Deutsche Bank reflects the CFTCâs
unwavering commitment to protect the integrity of critical, global financial benchmarks from profit-driven traders willing
to falsify market information to gain an edge over others. As reflected in the CFTCâs findings and the $800 million penalty
imposed, Deutsche Bankâs culture allowed such egregious and pervasive misconduct to thrive. We will be relentless in
continuing to investigate and bring benchmark manipulation cases until such time as those involved in setting these
benchmarks get the message that manipulation will not be tolerated, and the public can be confident in the integrity of
these benchmarks.â

The CFTC Order specifically finds that over a more than six-year period, from at least 2005 through early 2011 (the
relevant period), and across currencies, Deutsche Bankâs submitters routinely took into account other Deutsche Bank
tradersâ derivatives trading positions, as well as their own cash and derivatives trading positions, when making the
bankâs LIBOR and Euribor submissions. The conduct of Deutsche Bankâs submitters, traders, desk managers, and at least
one senior manager was systemic and pervasive, occurring across multiple trading desks and offices located in London,
Frankfurt, New York, Tokyo (a subsidiary of Deutsche Bank), and Singapore.

According to the Order, the cash and derivatives trading on the desks responsible for Deutsche Bankâs misconduct
increased throughout the relevant period and the desks generated significant revenues for Deutsche Bank, particularly
during the global financial crisis of 2007 through 2009.

The Order further finds that Deutsche Bank allowed submitters and traders to prioritize profit motives over appropriate
submission considerations, permitted a culture of trader self-interest to exist, and created conflicts of interest, which
allowed the misconduct to occur. For example, certain managers encouraged continual information sharing between
derivatives traders, money market traders, and submitters for the various benchmarks, even restructuring business lines
such that derivatives traders and submitters sat together in the London office.

In this environment, traders often shouted their requests for beneficial submissions across the trading floor to the
submitters. A senior manager regularly sat with the traders and encouraged them and their counterparts in other offices
to communicate and exchange trading positions, so submitters became clearly aware of the submissions that were most
favorable to the various desksâ trading positions. Senior desk managers in London, Frankfurt, New York, and the Tokyo
subsidiary of Deutsche Bank also made requests to benefit their own trading positions, facilitated their tradersâ requests
for beneficial submissions, and promoted the profit-driven submission practices to help the traders increase profits and
minimize losses on their and the deskâs trading positions.
Despite the obvious conflict of interest, Deutsche Bank allowed at times its traders who primarily traded derivatives, such
as its Yen derivatives trader, to be responsible for the Bankâs submissions, thus making it easy to skew the bankâs
submissions to benefit their own positions and to accommodate the requests of their fellow derivatives traders. These
practices continued even after the British Bankersâ Association, the trade association responsible for the issuance of
LIBOR, clarified in June 2008 that submissions should not be made by persons responsible for a bankâs derivatives trading
book, but rather should be made by persons responsible for the management of the bankâs cash. Deutsche Bankâs Yen
derivatives trader used his dual role as trader and submitter to assist the senior yen trader at UBS in his massive scheme
to manipulate Yen LIBOR over the same relevant period.

The Order finds that Deutsche Bank lacked internal controls, procedures, and policies concerning its LIBOR and Euribor
submission processes, and failed to adequately supervise its trading desks and traders to ensure that Deutsche Bankâs
LIBOR and Euribor submissions reflected an honest assessment of the costs of borrowing unsecured funds in the
interbank markets. These failures amplified the potential for misconduct and permitted the misconduct to continue for a
number of years.

Deutsche Bankâs misconduct occurred even after the CFTCâs Division of Enforcement requested in April 2010, that
Deutsche Bank conduct an internal investigation of its U.S. Dollar LIBOR submission practices. Deutsche Bank did not
make meaningful improvements in its internal controls until mid-2011, and did not formalize a policy about conflicts of
interest among traders and submitters relating to benchmark submissions until February 2013.

In accepting Deutsche Bankâs Offer, the Commission recognized the Bankâs cooperation with the Division of
Enforcementâs investigation of this matter, but noted that at the outset of the investigation in April 2010 and continuing
until mid-2011, Deutsche Bankâs cooperation was not sufficient, which affected, in part, a timely resolution of this matter.
After mid-2011, Deutsche Bank provided significant cooperation and assistance to the Division of Enforcement.

In related actions by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), DB Group Services UK Limited, a subsidiary of Deutsche Bank
AG, agreed to plead guilty to a criminal charge of wire fraud; Deutsche Bank AG entered into a deferred prosecution
agreement whereby it would continue to cooperate with the U.S. Department of Justice in exchange for the deferral of
criminal wire fraud and antitrust charges; and Deutsche Bank collectively accepted a penalty of $775 million. In addition,
the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) issued a Final Notice regarding its enforcement action against
Deutsche Bank AG and imposed a penalty of Â£226.8 million (approximately $340 million), and the New York State
Department of Financial Services announced that Deutsche Bank AG will pay a $600 million penalty, terminate individual
employees who engaged in misconduct, and install a monitor for violations of New York law.

The CFTC acknowledges the valuable assistance of the DOJ, the Washington Field Office of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, the FCA, the Japanese Financial Services Agency, and Bundesanstalt fur Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht
(BaFin).

With this Order, the CFTC has now imposed penalties of nearly $2.7 billion on six financial institutions and two interdealer
brokers for LIBOR, Euribor, and other interest rate benchmark abuses. In addition, for similar misconduct relating to
foreign exchange benchmarks, the CFTC recently imposed $1.4 billion on five financial institutions, for a total of over $4.1
billion in penalties in the CFTCâs enforcement program focused on ensuring the integrity of global financial benchmarks.
The fine imposed on Deutsche Bank represents the largest fine in the CFTCâs history.

Plaintiff, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ), by its
attorneys, alleges as follows:
iF SUMMARY

1. From July 16, 2011, and continuing through at least November 2012 (the
âRelevant Periodâ), My Global Leverage, LLC (ââMGLââ), by and through the actions of its
employees and agents, including, but not limited to Toney Blondo Eggleston (âEgglestonâ) (

âDefendantsâ), offered to enter into, and conducted an office or business in the United States, for

 
Case 2:15-cv-00745 Documenti Filed 04/23/15 Page 2 of 11

the purpose of soliciting or accepting orders for the purchase or sale of precious metals from
retail customers on a leveraged or financed basis. These transactions constituted illegal, off-
exchange retail commodity transactions. By this conduct, Defendants have engaged, are
engaging, or are about to engage in conduct in violation of Section 4(a) of the Commodity
Exchange Act (âActâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6(a) (2012).

2, Eggleston controlled MGL throughout the Relevant Period and failed to act in
good faith or knowingly induced MGLâs violations alleged herein. Therefore, Eggleston is also
liable for MGLâs violations as a control person of MGL, pursuant to 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13c(b) (2012).

3. At all relevant times, the acts and omissions of Eggleston and other MGL
representatives were committed within the scope of their employment, agency, or office with
MGL. Therefore, pursuant to 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(a)(1)(B) (2012) and 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.2 (2014), MGL is
liable as a principal for the actions and omissions of Eggleston and any other employee or agent
of MGL in violation of the Act.

4, Accordingly, pursuant to 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2012), the Commission brings this
action to enjoin Defendantsâ unlawful acts and practices, compel their compliance with the Act,
and further enjoin them from engaging in any commodity-related activity.

5, In addition, the Commission seeks civil monetary penalties, restitution, and
remedial ancillary relief, including, but not limited to, trading and registration bans,
disgorgement, rescission, pre- and post-judgment interest, and such other relief as the Court may
deem necessary and appropriate.

6. Unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, Defendants likely will continue

engaging in the acts and practices alleged in this Complaint and similar acts and practices, as

 
Case 2:15-cv-00745 Document1 Filed 04/23/15 Page 3 of 11

more fully described below.
Il. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

7. 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1 authorizes the Commission to seek injunctive relief against any
person whenever it shall appear to the Commission that such person has engaged, is engaging, or
is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a violation of the Act or of any rule,
regulation, or order thereunder.

8. Pursuant to 7 U.S.C, Â§Â§ 2(c)(2)(D) and 13a-1 (2012), the Commission has
jurisdiction over the conduct and transactions at issue in this case.

9, Pursuant to 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(e), venue properly lies with this Court because
Defendants transacted business in this District, and certain transactions, acts, and practices
alleged in this Complaint occurred, or are occurring, within this District.

TH. âTHE PARTIES

A. Plaintiff

10. _â Plaintiff U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an independent
federal regulatory agency charged by Congress with the administration and enforcement of the
Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1 et seq. (2012), and the Regulations promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1.1
et seq. (2014),

B. Defendants

11. Defendant My Global Leverage, LLC is a Nevada limited liability company
formed in December 2009. MGLâs license to do business in Nevada lapsed at the end of 2012.
Its principal place of business was in Las Vegas. MGL has never registered with the

Commission in any capacity.

 
Case 2:15-cv-00745 Document1 Filed 04/23/15 Page 4 of 11

12. During the Relevant Period, Defendant Toney Blondo Eggleston was the
managing member, owner, operator, and controlling person of MGL, managing its day-to-day
operations. From 1999 to September 2012, Eggleston was registered with the Commission as an
Associated Person (âAPâ) at several firms that were registered as Introducing Brokers,
Commodity Trading Advisors and Commodity Pool Operators.

IV. RELATED ENTITY

13. MGL introduced customers to Hunter Wise Commodities, LLC, a precious
metals dealer that confirmed the execution of customer precious metals transactions (âHunter
Wiseâ).

14. | Hunter Wise was organized as a California limited liability company in July 2007
and was registered to do business in Nevada. It maintained business addresses in Las Vegas,
Nevada and Irvine, California, On its website, Hunter Wise held itself out as âa physical
commodity trading company, wholesaler, market maker, back-office support provider, and
finance company.â Hunter Wise purported to offer, enter into, and confirm the execution of
retail commodity transactions involving gold, silver, platinum, palladium, and copper throughout
the United States using a network of telemarketing solicitors such as MGL that Hunter Wise
referred to as âdealers.â

15, On February 19, 2014, the United States District Court for the Southern District
of Florida, granted the Commissionâs motion for summary judgment finding that Hunter Wise
and other defendants violated 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6(a), CFTC v. Hunter Wise Commodities, LLC, 1 F.

Supp. 3d 1311, 1320-22 (S.D. Fla. 2014).

 
Case 2:15-cv-00745 Document1 Filed 04/23/15 Page 5 of 11

V. STATUTORY BACKGROUND

16. 7U,S.C. Â§ 2(c)(2)(D) gives the Commission jurisdiction over âany agreement,
contract, or transaction in any commodityâ that is entered into with, or offered to, a non-eligible
contract participant (âECPâ) âon a leveraged or margined basis, or financed by the offeror, the
counterparty, or a person acting in concert with the offeror or counterparty on a similar basisâ
(âretail commodity transactionsâ) with respect to conduct occurring on or after July 16, 2011,
subject to certain exceptions not applicable here. 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(c)(2)(D) makes 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6(a)
applicable to retail commodity transactions âas ifâ such transactions are contracts for the sale of
a commodity for future delivery.

17. The Act defines an ECP, in relevant part, as an individual who has amounts
invested on a discretionary basis, the aggregate of which exceeds $10 million, or $5 million if the
individual enters into the transaction to manage the risk associated with an asset owned or
liability incurred, or reasonably likely to be owned or incurred, by the individual. 7 U.S.C.

Â§ La(18)(A)(xi) (2012).

18. 7ULS.C. Â§ 6(a), in relevant part, makes it unlawful for any person to offer to enter
into, execute, confirm the execution of, or conduct any office or business anywhere in the United
States for the purpose of soliciting, accepting any order for, or otherwise dealing in any
transaction in, or in connection with, a contract for the purchase or sale of a commodity for
future delivery unless the transaction is conducted on or subject to the rules of a board of trade
that has been designated or registered by the Commission as a contract market.

VI FACTS

19, From July 16, 2011, and continuing through at least November 2012, Defendants

 
Case 2:15-cv-00745 Document1 Filed 04/23/15 Page 6 of 11

offered to enter into, executed, and confirmed the execution of financed precious metals
transactions with persons who were not ECPs. Defendants solicited individuals to invest in
financed precious metals transactions through Hunter Wise.

20. During the Relevant Period, MGL employed Eggleston and other individuals to,
among other things, solicit retail customers to engage in financed precious metals transactions
which constitute off-exchange retail commodity transactions.

21. Eggleston and MGLâs other employees conducted solicitations by telephone.
When soliciting customers for financed precious metals transactions, Eggleston represented that
to purchase a certain quantity of metal, the customers needed to deposit a percentage of the total
metal value, and that customers would receive a loan for the remaining amount. MGLâs website
stated that customers typically paid an initial minimum deposit of 20 to 25 percent of their metals
purchases. Hunter Wise provided the financing for the remaining balance of the purchases.
However, MGL did not disclose to at least some customers that Hunter Wise was involved in
their financed precious metals transactions.

22, After a customer invested, MGL contacted Hunter Wise to effectuate the
transaction. MGL collected the funds needed for the transaction from the customer and sent the
customerâs funds to Hunter Wise. Hunter Wise provided back office support services to MGL
and provided access to the details of the transaction to the customer via MGLâs website.

23. | MGL charged customers commissions and fees for purchasing the metal and
interest on loans to buy metal. Hunter Wise provided MGLâs share of the commissions and fees
to MGL after it received a customerâs funds from MGL,

24. | MGLâs customers did not take delivery of precious metals. Rather, most of

 
Case 2:15-cv-00745 Document1 Filed 04/23/15 Page 7 of 11

MGLâs customers were speculating on the price direction of precious metals.

25. During the Relevant Period, MGL introduced approximately 12 customers to
Hunter Wise and transferred at least $786,000 to Hunter Wise for the financing of precious
metals. During the Relevant Period, MGL received from Hunter Wise commissions and fees
totaling at least $257,680 for the retail financed precious metals transactions executed through
Hunter Wise.

26. MGL and Hunter Wise never bought, sold, loaned, stored, or transferred any
physical metals for these financed precious metals transactions. Likewise, MGL and Hunter
Wise never delivered any precious metals to any customers with respect to these financed metals
transactions.

27,  Atall times during the Relevant Period, the financed metals transactions that
MGL entered into with its customers were not made or conducted on, or subject to, the rules of
any board of trade, exchange or contract market.

28.  Atall times during the Relevant Period, Eggleston was the managing member and
owner of MGL. Eggleston exercised control over the day-to-day operations of MGL. Eggleston
was a signatory on MGLâs bank accounts and entered into agreements on behalf of MGL.

COUNT ONE
VIOLATIONS OF 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6(a): IULEGAL OFF-EXCHANGE TRADING
29. Paragraphs | through 28 of this Complaint are realleged and incorporated herein

by reference.

30. During the Relevant Period, the retail commodity transactions described in this

 
Case 2:15-cv-00745 Document1 Filed 04/23/15 Page 8 of 11

Complaint were offered and entered into by Defendants (a) on a leveraged or margined basis, or
financed by the offeror, the counterparty, or a person acting in concert with the offeror or
counterparty on a similar basis, (b) with persons who were not ECPs or eligible commercial
entities as defined by the Act, and (c) not made or conducted on, or subject to, the rules of any
board of trade, exchange or contract market.

31. The precious metals discussed in this Complaint are commodities as defined by 7
U.S.C. Â§ 1a(9) (2012).

32, As set forth above, from July 16, 2011, until at least November 2012, Defendants
MGL and Eggleston violated 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6(a) by offering to enter into, entering into, executing,
confirming the execution of, or conducting an office or business in the United States for the
purpose of soliciting or accepting orders for, or otherwise dealing in, transactions in, or in
connection with, retail commodity transactions.

33, Each offer to enter into, entrance into, execution, confirmation, solicitation, or
acceptance of an order for a retail commodity transaction made during the Relevant Period is
alleged in this Complaint as a separate and distinct violation of 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6(a).

34. Eggleston directly or indirectly controlled MGL and did not act in good faith or
knowingly induced, directly or indirectly, the acts constituting MGLâs violations of 7 U.S.C. Â§
6(a) alleged in this Complaint. Therefore, pursuant to 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13c(b), Eggleston is liable for
each of MGLâs violations of 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6(a) as a controlling person of MGL.

35. âThe acts and omissions of Eggleston and the other employees of MGL described

CFTC Charges Nevada-Based My Global Leverage, LLC and Toney Blondo Eggleston with
Engaging in Illegal, Off-Exchange Precious Metals Transactions with Retail Customers

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) announced the filing of a civil injunctive
enforcement action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada against Defendants My Global Leverage, LLC
(MGL) and its owner and managing member Toney Blondo Eggleston, who resides in Newport Coast, California. The
CFTC Complaint charges the Defendants with engaging in illegal, off-exchange transactions in precious metals with retail
customers on a leveraged, margined, or financed basis. The Complaint further alleges that Eggleston, as controlling
person for MGL, is liable for MGLâs violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA).

According to the Complaint, since at least July 16, 2011 and continuing through at least November 2012, MGL, by and
through its employees including Eggleston, solicited retail customers by telephone to engage in leveraged, margined, or
financed precious metals transactions. During that period, approximately 12 of MGLâs customers paid approximately
$786,000 to MGL in connection with precious metals transactions, and MGL received commissions and fees totaling
approximately $257,680 in connection with these precious metals transactions, according to the Complaint.

Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, leveraged, margined, or financed
transactions such as those conducted by MGL, are illegal off-exchange transactions unless they result in actual delivery
of metal within 28 days. The Complaint alleges that metals were never actually delivered in connection with the
leveraged, margined, or financed precious metals transactions made on behalf of MGLâs customers.

The Complaint further alleges that MGL executed the illegal precious metals transactions through Hunter Wise, LLC
(Hunter Wise). The CFTC filed an enforcement action against Hunter Wise, among others, in December 2012, charging
the defendants with engaging in illegal, off-exchange precious metals transactions, and charging Hunter Wise with fraud
and other violations (see CFTC Press Releases 6447-12 and 6655-13).

On February 19, 2014, the court found that Hunter Wise had no actual metal to deliver to customers and held that Hunter
Wise engaged in illegal precious metals transactions and was required to register as a Futures Commission Merchant but
did not do so and therefore violated Sections 4(a) and 4d of the CEA (see CFTC v. Hunter Wise Commodities, LLC, et al.,
12-81311 (Order on the Partiesâ Motions for Summary Judgment)). On April 15, 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Eleventh Circuit affirmed the courtâs issuance of a preliminary injunction and held that the CFTCâs jurisdiction under
Section 2(c)(2)(D) of the CEA extends to the precious metals transactions at issue in the case and that no exception to
the CFTCâs jurisdiction applied. And, on May 16, 2014, after a bench trial on the remaining claims, including fraud, the
District Court entered an Order finding that Hunter Wise fraudulently misrepresented the nature of precious metals
transactions that resulted in millions of dollars in customer losses (See CFTC Press Release 6935-14).

In its continuing litigation against MGL and Eggleston, the CFTC seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, civil monetary
penalties, permanent registration and trading bans, and a permanent injunction from future violations of the CEA, as
charged.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this action are Glenn Chernigoff, Michelle Bougas, Alison B.
Wilson, and Rick Glaser.

I, INTRODUCTION

On September 29, 2014, Plaintiff U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission
(âCommissionâ or âCFTCâ) filed its Complaint in this action [DE 1], seeking injunctive and
other equitable relief for violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (âActâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1-26
(2012) (2012), in connection with illegal off-exchange transactions involving the purported

Protection Act of 2010 (âDodd-Frank Actâ), Public Law 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376 (2010),
broadened the scope of the CFTCâs jurisdiction to include financed commodity transactions with
retail customers, including those at issue in this matter by amending 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(c)}(2) to create
a new subparagraph, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(c)(2)(D), entitled âRetail Commodity Transactions.â
Specifically, this broadened jurisdiction requires that financed commodity transactions with

THE PARTIES AGREE AND THE COURT HEREBY FINDS:

| The Court finds that there is good cause for the entry of this Consent Order and that there
is no just reason for delay. The Court therefore directs the entry of the following Findings of
Fact, Conclusions of Law, permanent injunction and equitable relief pursuant to Section 6c of the
Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2012), as set forth herein.
A. Findings of Fact

14. Plaintiff U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an independent federal
regulatory agency that is charged by Congress with administering and enforcing the Act, as
amended, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1, et seqg., and the Commission Regulations (âRegulationsâ) promulgated
thereunder, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1.1, et seq.

15. Defendant Inter-Global Currency & Precious Metals, LLC was a Florida limited
liability company formed in July 2011. Its principal place of business was Pompano Beach,
Florida. IGCPM was a telemarketing firm that employed Papastavrou and other individuals to,
among other things, solicit retail customers to engage in financed precious metals transactions.
IGCPM has never been registered with the Commission in any capacity.

16. Defendant Stavros Papastavrou is a resident of Delray Beach, Florida.
Papastavrou was the owner, operator, and controlling person of IGCPM, managing its day-to-day
operations. Papastavrou was a signatory on IGCPM bank accounts and entered into agreements
with Lloyds Commodities, LLC and AmeriFirst Management, LLC on behalf of IGCPM.

Papastavrou has never been registered with the Commission in any capacity.

17. From at least August 2011, and continuing through at least May 2013 (the
âRelevant Periodâ), Defendants offered to enter into, executed, and confirmed the execution of

leveraged, margined or financed precious metals (gold, silver, platinum and palladium)
 

Case 9:14-cv-81216-DMM Document 21 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/23/2015 Page 6 of 21

transactions with persons who were not eligible contract participants (âECPâ). See 7 U.S.C. Â§
1a(18)(xi) (2012) (defining ECP, in relevant part, as an individual who has amounts invested on
a discretionary basis, the aggregate of which exceeds $10 million, or $5 million if the individual
enters into the transaction to manage the risk associated with an asset owned or liability incurred,
or reasonably likely to be owned or incurred, by the individual. 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1a(18)(xi) (2012)).

18. None of the financed precious metals transactions offered by IGCPM were
conducted on or subject to the rules of a board of trade designated or registered by the
Commission as a contract market or derivatives transaction execution facility.

19. IGCPM introduced customers to Hunter Wise Commodities, LLC (âHunter Wiseâ),
a precious metals dealer that confirmed the execution of customer precious metal transactions,
directly or through Lloyds Commodities, LLC (âLloydsâ).

20. Hunter Wise was formed as a California company in July 2007 and has been
registered as a Nevada company since October 2010. It maintained a business addresses in Las
Vegas, Nevada and Irvine, California. Hunter Wise held itself out on its website as âa physical
commodity trading company, wholesaler, market maker, back-office support provider, and
finance company.â Hunter Wise purported to offer, enter into, and confirm the execution of
Retail Commodity Transactions involving gold, silver, platinum, palladium, and copper
throughout the United States using a network of telemarketing solicitors such as IGCPM that it
refers to as âdealers.â

21. On February 19, 2014, this Court, in an action captioned CFTC v. Hunter Wise
Commodities, LLC, granted the Commissionâs Motion for Summary Judgment finding that
Hunter Wise and the other defendants violated 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6(a). Case No. 9:12-cv-81311-DMM

(S.D. Fla. Feb. 19, 2014).
 

Case 9:14-cv-81216-DMM Document 21 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/23/2015 Page 7 of 21

22. Lloyds is a Florida limited liability company with its principal place of business in
Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. Lloyds was an intermediary firm that recruited precious metals
dealers to solicit customers who would execute Retail Commodity Transactions through Hunter
Wise. Lloyds has never been registered with the Commission.

23. IGCPM also introduced customers to AmeriFirst Management, LLC
(âAmeriFirstâ), a precious metals wholesaler and clearing firm that purported to confirm the
execution of customer precious metal transactions.

24. AmeriFirst held itself out on its website as a precious metals clearing and financing
firm for precious metals dealers and claimed to provide dealers with âtangible assets in a
growing physical marketâ and guarantee[s] that every ounce of metal in [the dealerâs] customers
[sic] account exists and is ready for delivery at any point and time.â On its website, AmeriFirstâs
product offering was gold, silver, and platinum in bar and coin form. On its website, AmeriFirst
also claimed to provide customer financing options for precious metal dealers. It operated
throughout the United States using a network of over 30 solicitation firms such as IGCPM that it
refers to as âdealers.â

25. On September 17, 2013, this Court, in an action captioned CFTC v. AmeriFirst
Management, LLC, entered a Consent Order of Permanent Injunction Against AmeriFirst,
finding that AmeriFirst violated 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6(a). Case No. 9:13-cv-61637-WPD (S.D. Fla. Sept.
17, 2013). In the order, AmeriFirst neither admitted nor denied its violation of 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6(a).
Id.

26. Papastavrou and IGCPMâs other employees conducted nearly all of their
solicitations by telephone. When soliciting customers for financed precious metals transactions,

Papastavrou and IGCPMâs other employees represented that to purchase a certain quantity of
Case 9:14-cv-81216-DMM Document 21 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/23/2015 Page 8 of 21

metal, the customers needed to deposit a percentage of the total metal value, and that customers
would receive a loan for the remaining amount. IGCPMâs website required an initial minimum
deposit of 25% of the customersâ metals purchase. Lloyds, Hunter Wise or AmeriFirst provided
the financing for the loans to the customers. However, IGCPM did not disclose to customers
Lloydâs, Hunter Wiseâs or AmeriFirstâs involvement in their financed precious metals
transactions.

27. After a customer invested, IGCPM contacted Lloyds, Hunter Wise or AmeriFirst to
effectuate the transaction. IGCPM collected the funds needed for the transaction from the
customer and sent them to Lloyds, Hunter Wise or AmeriFirst. Lloyds purportedly forwarded
funds that it received from IGCPM to Hunter Wise. Hunter Wise and AmeriFirst provided back
office support services to IGCPM and provided access to the details of the transaction to the
customer via a hyper-link on IGCPM website.

28. IGCPM charged customers commissions and fees for purchasing the metal and
interest on loans to buy metal. Lloyds/Hunter Wise provided IGCPMâs share of the
commissions and fees to IGCPM after it received the customerâs funds from IGCPM.
AmeriFirst initially operated in a similar fashion, but it later directed IGCPM to deduct its
commissions and fees from customer funds before forwarding those funds to AmeriFirst.

29. IGCPMâs customers did not take delivery of precious metals. Rather, the vast
majority of IGCPMâs customers were only speculating on the price direction of the precious
metals.

30. During the Relevant Period, IGCPM introduced approximately 22 customers to
Hunter Wise (directly or via Lloyds) and AmeriFirst and transferred at least approximately

$1.059 million to Lloyds, Hunter Wise and AmeriFirst for the financing of precious metals
 

Case 9:14-cv-81216-DMM Document 21 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/23/2015 Page 9 of 21

transactions. During the Relevant Period, IGCPM received commissions and fees totaling at
least $447,342 for the retail financed precious metals transactions executed through Hunter Wise
and AmeriFirst.

31. IGCPM, Lloyds, Hunter Wise and AmeriFirst never bought, sold, loaned, stored, or
transferred any physical metals for these financed precious metals transactions. Likewise,
IGCPM, Lloyds, Hunter Wise and AmeriFirst never delivered any precious metals to any
customers with respect to these financed metals transactions.

B. Conclusions of Law
1. Jurisdiction and Venue

32. | This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1, which
provides that whenever it shall appear to the Commission that any person has engaged, is
engaging, or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a violation of any provision of
the Act or any rule, regulation, or order promulgated thereunder, the Commission may bring an
action in the proper district court of the United States against such person to enjoin such act or
practice, or to enforce compliance with the Act, or any rule, regulation or order thereunder.

33. | The Commission has jurisdiction over the solicitations and transactions at issue in
this action pursuant to 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(c)(2)(D). Under Section Â§2(c)(2)(D), the Commission has
jurisdiction over âany agreement, contract, or transaction in any commodityâ that is entered into
with, or offered to, a non-ECP âon a leveraged or margined basis, or financed by the offeror, the
counterparty, or a person acting in concert with the offeror or counterparty on a similar basisâ
(âRetail Commodity Transactionsâ), with respect to conduct occurring on or after July 16, 2011,

subject to certain exceptions not applicable here.
34, Section 2(c)(2)(D) makes 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6(a), applicable to Retail Commodity

Transactions ââas ifâ such transactions are contracts for the sale of a commodity for future
 

Case 9:14-cv-81216-DMM Document 21 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/23/2015 Page 10 of 21

delivery.

35. Venue properly lies with this Court pursuant to 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(e), because
Defendants reside and/or maintain an office in this jurisdiction and the acts and practices in
violation of the Act occurred within this District.

3. Violation of 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6(a) â Off-Exchange Retail Commodity Transactions (Count
1 of the Complaint)

36. Under 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6(a), it is unlawful for any person to offer to enter into, execute,
confirm the execution of, or conduct any office or business anywhere in the United States for the
purpose of soliciting, accepting any order for, or otherwise dealing in any transaction in, or in
connection with, a contract for the purchase or sale of a commodity for future delivery unless the
transaction is conducted on or subject to the rules of a board of trade that has been designated or
registered by the Commission as a contract market.

37. During the Relevant Period, Defendantsâ Retail Commodity Transactions
described in the Complaint [DE 1] and the Consent Orderâs Findings of Fact, were offered and
entered into (a) on a leveraged or margined basis, or financed by the offeror, the counterparty, or
a person acting in concert with the offeror or counterparty on a similar basis; (b) with persons
who are not eligible contract participants or eligible commercial entities as defined by the Act;
and (c) these transactions were not made or conducted on, or subject to, the rules of any board of
trade, exchange or contract market. IGCPM and Papastavrou violated 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6(a), by
offering to enter into, entering into, and conducting an office or business in the United States for
the purpose of soliciting, or accepting orders for, or otherwise dealing in, these Retail
Commodity Transactions.

38. The foregoing acts, omissions, and failures of Papastavrou occurred within the

scope of his employment, office, or agency with IGCPM; therefore, pursuant to 7 U.S.C. Â§

10
 

Case 9:14-cv-81216-DMM Document 21 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/23/2015 Page 11 of 21

2(a)(1)(B) (2012), and 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.2 (2014), IGCPM is liable for Papastavrouâs acts, omissions, and
failures in violation of 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6(a).

39.  Papastavrou, directly or indirectly, controlled IGCPM, and did not act in good
faith or knowingly induced, directly or indirectly, the acts constituting the violations of IGCPM
described in this Consent Order. Pursuant to 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13c(b), therefore, Papastavrou is liable
as controlling person for the violations by IGCPM of the Act.

40. | Unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, there is a reasonable likelihood that
IGCPM and Papastavrou will continue to engage in the acts and practices alleged in the

Complaint and in similar acts and practices in violation of the Act.

IV. PERMANENT INJUNCTION

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT:

41. Based upon and in connection with the foregoing conduct, pursuant to 7 U.S.C.
Â§ 13a-1, Defendants are permanently restrained, enjoined and prohibited from directly or
indirectly offering to enter into, executing, confirming the execution of, or conducting any office
or business for the purpose of soliciting, accepting any order for, or otherwise dealing in any
transaction in, or in connection with, a contract for the purchase or sale of a commodity for
future delivery not conducted on or subject to the rules of a board of trade that has been
designated or registered by the Commission as a contract market, in violation of 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6(a).

42. Defendants are also permanently restrained, enjoined and prohibited from directly

futures, commodity options (as that term is defined in 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.3(hh) (2014))
(âcommodity optionsâ), security futures products, swaps (as that term is defined in
7 U.S.C. Â§ 1a(47), and as further defined by 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.3(xxx)), and/or foreign
currency (as described in 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 2(c)(2)(B) and (C)(i) (2012)) (âforex
contractsâ), for their own personal account or for any account in which they have a
direct or indirect interest;

Cc. Having any commodity futures, options on commodity futures, commodity
options, security futures products, forex contracts and/or swaps traded on their
behalf:

whether by power of attorney or otherwise, in any account involving commodity
futures, options on commodity futures, commodity options, security futures
products, forex contracts, and/or swaps;

e. Soliciting, receiving or accepting any funds from any person for the purpose of
purchasing or selling any commodity futures, options on commodity futures,
commodity options, security futures products, forex contracts and/or swaps;

f. Applying for registration or claiming exemption from registration with the
Commission in any capacity, and engaging in any activity requiring such
registration or exemption from registration with the Commission, except as
provided for in 17 C.F.R. Â§ 4.14(a)(9) (2014); and/or

g. Acting as a principal (as that term is defined in 17 C.F.R. Â§ 3.1(a) (2014)), agent
or any other officer or employee of any person (as that term is defined in 7 U.S.C.

Â§ la) registered, exempted from registration or required to be registered with the

12
Case 9:14-cv-81216-DMM Document 21 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/23/2015 Page 13 of 21

Commission except as provided for in 17 C.F.R. Â§ 4.14(a)(9).

V. RESTITUTION AND CIVIL MONETARY PENALTY
A. Restitution

43. | IGCPM and Papastavrou shall pay restitution in the amount of four hundred and
forty-seven thousand, three hundred and forty-two dollars ($447,342) (âRestitution Obligationâ),
plus post-judgment interest. IGCPM and Papastavrou are jointly and severally liable for their
Restitution Obligation.

44. Defendants will pay their Restitution Obligation within thirty (30) days of the date
of the entry of this Consent Order. If the Restitution Obligation is not paid in full within thirty
(30) days of the date of entry of this Consent Order, then post-judgment interest shall accrue on
the Restitution Obligation beginning on the date of entry of this Consent Order and shall be
determined by using the Treasury Bill rate prevailing on the date of entry of this Consent Order
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1961 (2006).

45. To effect payment of the Restitution Obligation and the distribution of any
restitution payments to Defendantsâ customers, the Court appoints Melanie Damian, Esq., as
Monitor (the âMonitorâ).? The Monitor shall collect restitution payments from Defendants and
make distributions as set forth below. Because the Monitor is acting as an officer of this Court in

performing these services, the Monitor shall not be liable for any action or inaction arising from

 

2 On December 5, 2012, the Commission filed a civil enforcement action in the U.S. District
Court for the Southern District of Florida against Hunter Wise and various other entities and
individuals. See CFTC v. Hunter Wise Commodities, LLC, Case No. 9:12-cv-81311-DMM (S.D.
Fla. Feb. 25, 2013) (the âHunter Wise Litigationâ). On February 22, 2013, the Southern District
of Florida appointed Ms. Damian as the Special Monitor and Corporate Manager in the Hunter
Wise Litigation. See Order Temporarily Appointing Special Corporate Monitor (DE 77). In
connection with her duties in that matter, the Monitor has implemented a Claims Administration
Process and Distribution Plan for all customers and creditors of Hunter Wise, among other

entities.

13
Case 9:14-cv-81216-DMM Document 21 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/23/2015 Page 14 of 21

her appointment as Monitor, other than actions involving fraud.

46. Defendants shall make Restitution Obligation payments under this Consent Order
to the Monitor in the name of the âInter-Global Currency & Precious Metals LLC/Stavros
Papastavrou (Hunter Wise/AmeriFirst Transactions) Settlement Fundâ and shall send such
Restitution Obligation payments by electronic funds transfer, or by U.S. postal money order,
certified check, bank cashierâs, or bank money order, to the Monitor at the office of Damian &
Valori LLP, 1000 Brickell Avenue, Suite 1020, Miami, Florida 33131, under cover letter that
identifies the paying Defendant and the name and docket number of this proceeding. The paying
Defendant shall simultaneously transmit copies of the cover letter and the form of payment to the
Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Three Lafayette Centre,
1155 21st Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20581.

47. | The Monitor shall oversee the Restitution Obligation and shall have the discretion
to determine the manner of distribution of such funds in an equitable fashion to Defendantsâ
customers or may defer distribution until such time as the Monitor deems appropriate. In the
event that the amount of Restitution Obligation payments to the Monitor are of a de minimis
nature such that the Monitor determines that the administrative cost of making a distribution to
eligible customers is impractical, the Monitor may, in its discretion, treat such restitution
payments as civil monetary penalty payments, which the Monitor shall forward to the
Commission following the instructions for civil monetary penalty payments set forth in Part V.B.
below.

48. Defendants shall cooperate with the Monitor as appropriate to provide such
information as the Monitor deems necessary and appropriate to identify the customers to whom

the Monitor, in her sole discretion, may determine to include in any plan for distribution of any

14
 

Case 9:14-cv-81216-DMM Document 21 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/23/2015 Page 15 of 21

Restitution Obligation payments. Defendants shall execute any documents necessary to release
funds that they have in any repository, bank, investment or other financial institution, wherever
located, in order to make partial or total payment toward the Restitution Obligation.

49. The Monitor shall provide the Commission at the beginning of each calendar year
with a report detailing the disbursement of funds to Defendantsâ customers during the previous
year. The Monitor shall transmit this report under a cover letter that identifies the name and
docket number of this proceeding to the Chief Financial Officer, U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20581.

50. The amounts payable to each customer shall not limit the ability of any customer
to prove that a greater amount is owed from Defendants or any other person or entity, and
nothing herein shall be construed in any way to limit or abridge the rights of any customer that
exist under state or common law.

51. Pursuant to Rule 71 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, each customer of
Defendants who suffered a loss is explicitly made an intended third-party beneficiary of this
Consent Order and may seek to enforce obedience of this Consent Order to obtain satisfaction of
any portion of the restitution that has not been paid by Defendants to ensure continued
compliance with any provision of this Consent Order and to hold Defendants in contempt for any
violations of any provision of this Consent Order.

52. To the extent that any funds accrue to the U.S. Treasury for satisfaction of
Defendantsâ Restitution Obligation, such funds shall be transferred to the Monitor for
disbursement in accordance with the procedures set forth above.

B. Civil Monetary Penalty

53. | IGCPM and Papastavrou shall pay a civil monetary penalty in the amount of one

hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) (âCMP Obligationâ), plus post-judgment interest. IGCPM

15
Case 9:14-cv-81216-DMM Document 21 Entered on FLSD Docket 04/23/2015 Page 16 of 21

and Papastavrou are jointly and severally liable for their CMP Obligation.

54. | Defendants shall pay their CMP Obligation within thirty (30) days of the date of
the entry of this Consent Order. If the CMP Obligation is not paid in full within thirty (30) days
of the date of entry of this Consent Order, then post-judgment interest shall accrue on the CMP
Obligation beginning on the date of entry of this Consent Order and shall be determined by using
the Treasury Bill rate prevailing on the date of entry of this Consent Order pursuant to 28 U.S.C.
Â§ 1961 (2012).

55. | Defendants shall pay their CMP Obligation by electronic funds transfer, U.S.
postal money order, certified check, bank cashierâs check, or bank money order. If payment is to
be made other than by electronic funds transfer, then the payment shall be made payable to the
U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and sent to the address below:

Federal Court in Florida Orders Restitution, a Civil Monetary Penalty, and Permanent
Trading Bans against Inter-Global Currency & Precious Metals and Stavros Papastavrou for
Engaging in Illegal, Off-Exchange Precious Metals Transactions

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced that a federal court in Ft.
Lauderdale, Florida issued a Consent Order against Defendants Inter-Global Currency & Precious Metals, LLC
(IGCPM) of Pompano Beach, Florida, and its owner, manager, and controlling person Stavros Papastavrou, of Delray
Beach, Florida. The Order, issued by the Honorable Judge Donald M. Middlebrooks of the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of Florida, assesses a civil monetary penalty of $100,000 and a restitution award of $447,342, and
permanently bans IGCPM and Papastavrou from registering, trading, soliciting, and engaging in other CFTC-regulated
activities.

According to the Order, since at least August 2011 and continuing through at least May 2013, IGCPM, by and through its
employees including Papastavrou, solicited retail customers by telephone to engage in leveraged, margined, or financed
precious metals (including gold, silver, platinum, and palladium) transactions. During that period, the Order finds that
IGCPMâs customers paid at least $1 million to IGCPM in connection with precious metals transactions and that IGCPM
received commissions and fees totaling at least $447,342 in connection with these precious metals transactions.

Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, leveraged, margined, or financed
transactions such as those conducted by IGCPM, are illegal off-exchange transactions unless they result in actual delivery
of metal within 28 days. The Order finds that metals were never actually delivered in connection with the leveraged,
margined, or financed precious metals transactions made on behalf of IGCPMâs customers.

The Order further finds that IGCPM executed the illegal precious metals transactions through Lloyds Commodities, LLC
(Lloyds), Hunter Wise, LLC (Hunter Wise) and AmeriFirst Management LLC (AmeriFirst). The CFTC filed enforcement
actions against, among others, Lloyds and Hunter Wise in December 2012 and AmeriFirst in July 2013, charging each
with engaging in illegal, off-exchange precious metals transactions, and charging AmeriFirst and Hunter Wise with fraud
and other violations (see CFTC Press Releases 6447-12 and 6655-13).

On September 18, 2013, the court entered a consent order resolving the Commissionâs claims against AmeriFirst, finding
it liable for illegal, off-exchange precious metals transactions and fraud (See CFTC Press Release 6973-14).

On February 5, 2014, in a consent order resolving the Commission's claims against Lloyds, the court ordered Lloyds
Commodities to pay over $5 million in restitution and penalties (see CFTC Press Release 6850-14).

On February 19, 2014, the court found that Hunter Wise had no actual metal to deliver to customers and held that Hunter
Wise engaged in illegal precious metals transactions and was required to register as a futures commission merchant but
did not do so and therefore violated Sections 4(a) and 4d of the CEA (see CFTC v. Hunter Wise Commodities, LLC, et al.,
12-81311-ClV (Order on the Partiesâ Motions for Summary Judgment)). On April 15, 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Eleventh Circuit affirmed the courtâs issuance of a preliminary injunction and held that the Commissionâs jurisdiction
under Section 2(c)(2)(D) of the CEA extends to the precious metals transactions at issue in the case and that no
exception to the Commissionâs jurisdiction applied. And, on May 16, 2014, after a bench trial on the remaining claims,
including fraud, the court entered an order finding that Hunter Wise fraudulently misrepresented the nature of precious
metals transactions that resulted in millions of dollars in customer losses (see CFTC Press Release 6935-14).

The CFTC cautions victims that restitution orders may not result in the recovery of money lost because the wrongdoers
may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers and to
ensure the wrongdoers are held accountable.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this action are Kevin S. Webb, Michelle Bougas, James H.
Holl, lll, and Rick Glaser.

MONETARY PENALTY AND OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF

I. INTRODUCTION

On March 27, 2013, Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ

 

or âCFTCâ) filed a Complaint (âComplaintâ) against Defendant James Harvey Mason (âMasonâ
or âDefendantâ) and Relief Defendants The JHM Forex Only Pool (f/k/a The JHM Forex Only
Pool, LP), and Forex Trading at Home (âRelief Defendantsâ), seeking injunctive and other
equitable relief, as well as the imposition of civil penalties, for violations of the Commodity
Exchange Act (âCEAâ or âActâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1 ef seq. (2012), and the Commissionâs
Regulations (âRegulationsâ) promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1.1 et seg. (2014) (Dkt. #1).
Specifically, the CFTCâs Complaint alleged that Defendant has violated, and is continuing to

violate, Sections 4b(a)(2)(A) and (C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6b(a)(2)(A) and (C), Sections
4m(1), and 40(1)(A) and (B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6m(1), and 60(1)(A) and (B), and
Regulation 5.3(a)(2), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 5.3(a)(2).

The Court entered an ex parte Statutory Restraining Order (âSROâ) against Defendant
and Relief Defendants on March 27,2013 (kt. #11). The SRO froze assets under Defendantâs
and Relief Defendantsâ control, ordered an accounting of assets, permitted CFTC access to all of
Defendantâs and Relief Defendantsâ books and records, prohibited the destruction of documents,
and appointed Joseph W. Grier III, of Grier, Furr & Crisp, P.A. as the Receiver to, inter alia,
take exclusive custody, control, and possession of all funds, property and other assets in the
possession or control of the Defendant and Relief Defendants, and to perform all acts necessary
to hold, manage, and preserve the value of such assets (collectively, the âReceivership Estateâ).

The Court subsequently entered an Order of Preliminary Injunction (âPreliminary
Injunctionâ) against Defendant and Relief Defendants on May 22, 2013 (Dkt. #22). The
Preliminary Injunction continued the relief granted by the SRO, additionally required the
Defendant and Relief Defendants to submit an accounting, and prohibited the Defendant from

committing further violations of the Act.

Il. CONSENTS AND AGREEMENTS

and/or Relief Defendants in any other proceeding.

Ili. FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Court, being fully advised in the premises, finds that there is good cause for the entry
of this Consent Order and that there is no just reason for delay. The Court therefore directs the
entry of the following Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, permanent injunction and equitable
relief pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1, as set forth herein.

THE PARTIES AGREE AND THE COURT HEREBY FINDS:

A. Findings of Fact
1. The Parties To This Consent Order

14. Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an independent federal
regulatory agency that is charged by Congress with administering and enforcing the Act,
TUS. Â§Â§ | et seq., and the Regulations promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1.1 ef seq.

15. Defendant James Harvey Mason resides in Graham, North Carolina, and also
has an address and conducts business in Mill Spring, North Carolina. Mason has never been
registered with the Commission in any capacity. Mason is facing a concurrent criminal

prosecution in United States v. James Harvey Mason, Case No.: 3:14-cr-122-FDW, filed in the

 
U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina, on charges of securities fraud
conspiracy and filing a false tax return arising out of the same or similar conduct as alleged in the
Complaint. In June, 2014, Mason pled guilty to single counts of securities fraud conspiracy and
filing a false federal tax return for tax year 2011.

16. Relief Defendant The JHM Forex Only Pool (f/k/a The JHM Forex Only Pool,
LP) (âJHMâ), is a commodity pool with business addresses in Snow Camp, Mill Spring, and
Hendersonville, North Carolina. Mason was the general partner of The JHM Forex Only Pool,
LP, and sole proprietor of JHM. JHM operates through several interrelated companies, including
The JHM Forex Only Pool Irrevocable Trust and JHM Holdings, LLC, which were wholly
owned and/or operated by defendant Mason. JHM has never been registered with the
Commission in any capacity. As a Relief Defendant, JHM held pool participantsâ funds in
constructive trust for the participants.!

17. Relief Defendant Forex Trading at Home (âFTAHâ) is a commodity pool with
a business address in Graham, North Carolina. FTAH operates through several interrelated
companies, including âForex Trading at Home Association,â âForex Trading at Home Partners,â
and/or âFTAH Partners,â operated by defendant Mason. FTAH and the interrelated companies
were owned by each of their respective partners, members, or investors. However, Mason was
the registered agent for most, if not all, of the FTAH companies and he was elected by the
members to trade on behalf of FTAH. FTAH has never been registered with the Commission in
any capacity. As a Relief Defendant, FTAH held pool participantsâ funds in constructive trust for

the participants.

' The Receiver has liquidated all remaining assets in the JHM and FTAH pools and consolidated
such funds into the Receivership Estate. Therefore, neither JHM nor FTAH currently hold
participant funds.

 

 
2. Defendantâs Scheme

18. Beginning in at least July 2010, Mason acted as a commodity pool operator
(âCPOâ) and in that capacity he fraudulently solicited, accepted, and pooled at least $5,300,000
from approximately 500 individuals and used the funds to trade off-exchange foreign currency
contracts (âforexâ) in two commodity pools, JHM and FTAH (collectively, the âPoolsââ). Mason
was never registered with the Commission as a CPO.

19, | When soliciting and accepting funds for and/or operating the pools, Mason
intentionally or recklessly provided participants and prospective participants with written
documents that contained materially false or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose
material facts, including: (a) telling participants they would not lose their principal; (b) claiming
that participants would make expected profits of 1.1% per day and as much as 340% to 500%
annually; (c) misrepresenting the significant risk of loss associated with forex trading; and (d)
failing to disclose to all investors that he had been convicted of felony wire fraud in connection
with the purchase and/or sale of commodities in 2000. Additionally, Mason appears to have
misappropriated at least $779,000 of pool participantsâ funds and used such funds for purposes
other than for forex trading.

3. JHM and FTA Pool Solicitations

20. Beginning in at least July 2010 and continuing through at least December 2012,
Mason solicited individuals to become participants in the JHM pool. Mason also permitted and
encouraged other persons to solicit participants in the JHM pool.

21. In about September 2012, Mason began to solicit individuals directly to become
participants in the FTAH pool. Mason also permitted and encouraged other individuals to solicit

participants in the FTAH pool. Mason marketed FTAH to at least some participants as a trading

 

 
system, but claimed that the funds used to purchase the trading system would be placed in the
FTAH pool and used for forex trading.

22, Based upon Masonâs solicitations, approximately 500 participants invested at
least $5,300,000 with JHM and FTAH for the purpose of trading forex. However, Mason pooled
only a portion of the participant funds and placed them in forex trading accounts in JHMâs and
FTAHâs name. Mason deposited the rest of the participant funds in various bank accounts,
withdrew funds as needed to make âPonziâ payments to other participants, and misappropriated
participant funds and used them for personal purposes other than for forex trading.

4. Misrepresentations About Risk and Profit

23. In written communications with participants in both the JHM or FTAH pools,
Mason made numerous fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions. For example, in a
document styled âOperations Policiesâ dated June 11, 2012, which Mason sent to JHM pool
participants, Mason represented that he could guarantee participantsâ funds, and that participants
should consider the âOperations Policy document as a written guarantee that their funds
personally invested are guaranteed by either the Fund Managers earnings or future earnings,
receivables on loans made to other account holders or deposits and assets held in Trust for
account holders benefit.â

24. Similarly, in an October 4, 2012 email to JHM pool participants, Mason promised
participants that if he lived until September 2013, all participants would be able to withdraw their
pool funds. Implicit in this statement was that participants would not lose any money as a result
of Masonâs trading forex.

25, On October 9, 2012, Mason sent an email to JHM participants stating, among
other things, that he âleaves the majority of performance earnings, less necessary operating

capital withdrawals, within the Pool to build a fund that in the future will guarantee one hundred

 

 
(100%) percent of investorâs personally invested capital,â and attached a spreadsheet describing
expected profits from investments for a period of five years. According to the spreadsheet, an
investment of $5,000 could be expected to grow more than 500% annually, meaning that after
five years, the investment was expected to be worth more than $100,000,000.

26. Mason made similar representations with respect to the FTAH pool. For example,
in a July 26, 2012, email, Mason guaranteed that if purchasers of the trading system marketed
through FTAH lost money within their first 90 days of trading, he would refund the full purchase
price. In an August 29, 2012, email to FTAH participants, Mason promised to grow a memberâs
$1,000 deposit through trading activities into a total of $4,400 within a time period of 260
trading days, or one year time frame, equal to a 340% annual return. On September 9, 2012,
Mason further represented that his FTAH trading system was so effective that it âcan âhelp
peopleâ more than any investment they could possibly make anywhere, including getting an
account into the Pool. At $500.00 it can help a lot of people become independent,â and âIt will
help any of your friends and any member of your family, possibly more than any education they
could ever attain.â

5. Misrepresentations about Defendantâs Background

27. Ina biography he provided to participants, Mason described himself as a former
cotton mill manager and owner with over thirty-five (35) years of experience trading commodity
futures and options. However, Mason failed to disclose in his biography that in 2000 he was
convicted of wire fraud in connection with certain cotton trades, or that he was sentenced to
eighteen months in prison and three years of supervised release. Additionally, Mason knew or
recklessly disregarded the fact that he did not possess that many years of experience trading

commodity futures and options.

 

 
6. Defendantâs Trading Losses, False Account Information, and Misappropriation
of Participant Funds

28.  Masonâs forex trading in the JHM and FTAH accounts was not profitable. Mason
lost over $1,120,000 trading between July 2010 and March 2013. Notwithstanding these trading
losses, Mason provided false information to pool participants utilizing internet-based online
accounts which falsely indicated that Mason was making a profit in forex trading.

29. Mason misappropriated at least $779,000 of participant funds and used such funds
for purposes other than forex trading. Mason used participant funds to purchase real estate, cars,
and to pay his personal credit card bills, among other expenses.

7. Defendantâs Failure to Register as a Commodity Pool Operator

30. Defendant has acted as the CPO of JHM and FTAH. With certain exemptions
and exclusions not applicable here, all CPOs are required to be registered with the Commission,
pursuant to the Act and its Regulations. As described above, Defendant, without being
registered with the Commission as a CPO, solicited and accepted funds from pool participants
who were not âeligible contract participantsâ (as defined in the Act), using instrumentalities of
interstate commerce, for the purpose of engaging in retail forex transactions in the JHM and
FTAH pools.

8. Relief Defendants JAM and FTAH Have no Legitimate Interest or Claim to
Participant Funds

31. In order to obtain complete relief for Defendantâs defrauded customers, JHM and
FTAH are named as nominal or relief defendants. JHM and FTAH are appropriate nominal
defendants in this action because they were used as instrumentalities of the Defendantâs acts and
held assets that rightfully belonged to the Defendantâs defrauded investors. JHM and FTAH
each possessed funds illegally obtained by the Defendant and, accordingly, had no legitimate

interest or entitlement to any pool participant funds. Accordingly, the court-appointed Receiver

10

 

 
has liquidated all remaining assets in the JHM and FTAH pools and consolidated such funds into
the Receivership Estate.
B. Conclusions of Law
1. Jurisdiction and Venue

32. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 6c of the Act,
7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1, which provides that whenever it shall appear to the Commission that any
person has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a .
violation of any provision of the Act or any rule, regulation, or order promulgated thereunder, the
Commission may bring an action in the proper district court of the United States against such
person to enjoin such act or practice, or to enforce compliance with the Act, or any rule,
regulation or order thereunder.

33. The Commission has jurisdiction over the forex solicitations and transactions at
issue in this action pursuant to Section 2(c)(2)(C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(c)(2)(C).

34. Venue properly lies with this Court pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
Â§ 13a-1(e), because the Defendant transacted business in this District, and the acts and practices
in violation of the Act occurred within this District.

2. Fraud by Material Misrepresentations, Omissions and Misappropriation of
Participant Funds

35. â By the conduct described in paragraphs 1 through 31 above, Defendant cheated
and defrauded, or attempted to cheat and defraud, and willfully deceived, or attempted to
deceive, his pool participants by, among other things, knowingly or recklessly:
misappropriating pool participantsâ funds and making material misrepresentations and omissions
of material facts to the prospective and actual pool participants in violation of Section

4b(a)(2)(A) and (C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§6b(a)(2)(A) and (C).

il

 

 

 
36. By the conduct described in paragraphs | through 31 above, Defendant used the
mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce while acting as a CPO to employ a
device, scheme or artifice to defraud his pool participants, and engaged in a transaction, practice
or course of business which operated as a fraud upon his pool participants, by, among other
things, knowingly or recklessly: emailing written communications containing fraudulent
misrepresentations and omissions of material facts to both JHM and FTAH participants and
prospective participants, and by misappropriating pool participantsâ funds, in violation of Section
4o(1)(A) and (B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 60(1)(A) and (B).

3. Defendant Failed to Register as a CPO in Violation of Section 4m(1) of the Act and
Regulation 5.3(a)(2)(0

37. By the conduct described in paragraphs 1 through 31 above, Defendant, without
being registered with the Commission, while acting as a CPO, solicited and accepted funds from
pool participants using instrumentalities of interstate commerce, for the purpose of trading forex.
Thus, since October 18, 2010, Defendant has acted as the CPO of JHM and FTAH without being
registered in violation of Section 4m(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6m(1), and Regulation
5.3(a)(2)@), 17 C.F.R. Â§5.3(a)(2)().

4. Permanent Injunctive Relief is Necessary and Appropriate

38. Unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, there is a reasonable likelihood that
the Defendant will continue to engage in the acts and practices alleged in the Complaint and in
similar acts and practices in violation of the Act and Regulations. Permanent injunctive relief is
appropriate in this case because the lengthy nature of Defendantâs misconduct as alleged, and his

previous conviction of wire fraud are suggestive of future violations of the Act.

12

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT: |

39. Based upon and in connection with the foregoing conduct, pursuant to Section 6c
of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1, Defendant is permanently restrained, enjoined and prohibited from

benefit of registration, in violation of Section 4m(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.

limited to, using the mails or other instrumentalities of interstate commerce in

 

connection with CPO business without being registered with the Commission;
and,

c. Using the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce while
acting as a CPO to employ a device, scheme or artifice to defraud any pool

within ten (10) days of the date of the entry of this Consent Order. If the Restitution Obligation

 

is not paid in full within ten (10) days of the date of entry of this Consent Order, then post-

North Carolina (âCriminal Caseâ), For amounts disbursed to Defendantâs pool participants and

payment to those pool participants and customers.

43. The amounts payable to each pool participant and customer shall not limit the
ability of any pool participant and customer from proving that a greater amount is owed from
Defendant or any other person or entity, and nothing herein shall be construed in any way to
limit or abridge the rights of any pool participant and customer that exist under state or common
law.

44. Pursuant to Rule 71 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, each pool participant
and customer of Defendant who suffered a loss is explicitly made an intended third-party
beneficiary of this Consent Order and may seek to enforce obedience of this Consent Order to
obtain satisfaction of any portion of the restitution that has not been paid by Defendant to ensure
continued compliance with any provision of this Consent Order and to hold Defendant in
contempt for any violations of any provision of this Consent Order.

45. Upon the termination of the Receivership Estate, the Receiver shall provide the
Commission with a report detailing the disbursement of any funds to Defendantâs pool
participants. The Receiver shall transmit this report under a cover letter that identifies the name
and docket number of this proceeding to the Chief Financial Officer, Commodity Futures

Trading Commission, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21"" Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20581.

within ten (10) days of the date of the entry of this Consent Order. If the CMP Obligation is not
paid in full within ten (10) days of the date of entry of this Consent Order, then post-judgment
interest shall accrue on the CMP Obligation beginning on the date of entry of this Consent Order

Consent Order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1961.

47. Defendant shall pay his CMP Obligation by electronic funds transfer, U.S. postal
money order, certified check, bank cashierâs check, or bank money order. If payment is to be

Federal Court Orders North Carolina Resident James Harvey Mason to Pay a Civil Penalty
and Restitution Totaling $5.5 Million for Commodity Pool Fraud

In a related criminal action involving the same conduct, Mason pleaded
guilty in June 2014 and is awaiting sentencing

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced that Judge C. Graham
Mullen of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina entered a Consent Order against Defendant
James Harvey Mason of Graham, North Carolina, imposing a $1.67 million civil monetary penalty and restitution of
$3.88 million in connection with off-exchange foreign currency (forex) commodity pool fraud in violation of the
Commodity Exchange Act (CEA). The Consent Order also permanently enjoins Mason from further violations of the CEA,
as charged, and imposes permanent trading and registration bans on him. Mason has never been registered with the
CFTC in any capacity.

The Court Order arises out of the CFTC enforcement Complaint filed on March 27, 2013 (see CFTC Complaint and Press
Release 6549-13). The Consent Order finds that, commencing in at least July 2010, Mason fraudulently solicited,
accepted, and pooled at least $5.3 million from approximately 500 participants. The Consent Order further finds that
Mason pooled only a portion of the participant funds and placed them in forex trading accounts in his commodity poolsâ
names, in which he lost over $1.12 million trading and that he deposited the rest of the participant funds in various bank
accounts, withdrawing funds as needed to make âPonziâ payments to other participants, and misappropriating at least
$779,000 of participant funds and using such funds for purposes other than for forex trading.

Related Criminal Action

In a criminal action in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina involving the same conduct, Mason
pleaded guilty in June 2014 to single counts of securities fraud conspiracy and filing a false tax return for tax year 2011,
and is awaiting sentencing (see U.S. v. james Harvey Mason, No. 3:14-cr-122-FDW).

The CFTC cautions victims that restitution orders may not result in the recovery of money lost because the wrongdoers
may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers and to
ensure the wrongdoers are held accountable

The CFTC appreciates the assistance of the North Carolina Secretary of State Securities Division and the U.S. Attorneyâs
Office for the Western District of North Carolina in this matter.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Barry R. Blankfield, Jennifer E. Smiley, Heather
Johnson, Patricia Gomersall, Joseph Konizeski, Scott Williamson, and Rosemary Hollinger.

CFTCâs Commodity Pool Fraud Advisory

The CFTC has issued several customer protection Fraud Advisories that provide the warning signs of fraud, including the
Commodity Pool Fraud Advisory, which warns customers about a type of fraud that involves individuals and firms, often

unregistered, offering investments in commodity pools.

Customers can report suspicious activities or information, such as possible violations of commodity trading laws, to the
CFTC Division of Enforcement via a Toll-Free Hotline 866-FON-CFTC (866-366-2382) or file a tip or complaint online.

Commodities Trading LLC (âChurchhillâ) (collectively âDefendantsâ). For the
reasons stated below, the Commissionâs Application is GRANTED and an Order
of Permanent Injunction together with civil monetary penalties and restitution
relief is contained herein.â
I, BACKGROUND

On January 28, 2015, the Commission filed a Complaint for Injunctive and
Other Equitable Relief and Penalties Under the Commodity Exchange Act
(âComplaintâ) alleging that Defendants violated the Commodity Exchange Act
(âActâ), as amended, 7 U.S.C Â§ | ef seg. (2012). The Commissionâs Complaint
alleges that Defendants solicited, obtained and/or mananged $737,000 from six
customers. According to the Commissionâs Complaint, a portion of these funds
were to used to purchase precious metals and a portion was to be traded in futures
trading accounts. The Commisionâs Complaint alleges that Defendants defrauded
their customers by claiming that they were purchasing precious metals on behalf of
some of the customers, when they were not; misrepresenting profit potential and
risk of loss associated with the trading of commodity futures contracts and
precious metals; and misappropriating customer funds. Additionally, the

Commissionâs Complaint alleges that Defendants were not registered with the

 

* Having read and considered the papers presented by the Commission, the Court finds this

matter appropriate for disposition without a hearing. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 78; Local Rule 7-15.
Accordingly, the hearing set for May 4, 2015 at 1:30 p.m. is hereby vacated and off calendar.

Commission as commodity trading advisors (âCTAsâ) as required, and therefore,
unlawfully traded customer funds in managed futures accounts.
Il. PROCEDURAL HISTORY

On January 28, 2015, the Commission filed its Complaint. On January 30,
2015, this Court entered an Ex Parte Statutory Restraining Order freezing
Defendantsâ assets, prohibiting the destruction of, or prevention of CFTC access to
Defendantsâ books and records, and providing for other relief. (Dkt. No. 25). On
February 13, 2015, this Court entered an Order of Preliminary Injunction, finding
that there is good cause to believe that the Defendants have engaged, are engaging,
or are about to engage in conduct in violations of the Act, and preliminarily
enjoining Defendants from directly or indirectly violating Sections 4(a) and
4b(a)(2)(A) and (C), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6(a), 6b(a)(2)(A) and (C) (2012), and from
engaging in activities subject to the Commissionâs jurisdiction. (Dkt. No. 33).

The Commission properly served Defendants with a summons and the
Complaint on February 3, 2015. On that date, the Commission served Valois and
Wong via personal service (Dkt. Nos. 28, 30); and completed service upon Bertram
and Churchhill by serving summons upon Valois. (Dkt. No. 29). Defendants failed
to answer, plead, or otherwise respond to the Complaint within 21 days and on
February 25, 2015, this Court entered a default against the Defendants pursuant to
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (âF.R.Civ.P.â) Rule 55(a) for failure to defend and
failure to comply with the Courtâs orders. (Dkt. No. 34). The Court instructed the

Commission to file a motion for default judgment at its earliest convenience and to
set a hearing date in accordance with local rules 6-1 and 55-1. Jd.

The Court has carefully considered the Complaint, the factual allegations
which are well-pled and hereby taken as true, and the Commissionâs Application
and the Memorandum and Exhibits in support thereof. Having been fully advised
and familiar with the record in this matter, the Court hereby enters findings of fact
and conclusions of law, and issues a final order of permanent injunction,
restitution, a civil monetary penalty, and other equitable relief pursuant to Section
6c of the Act, as amended, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1, as set forth herein.

HI. FINDINGS OF FACT
A. Parties

The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an independent federal
regulatory agency charged by Congress with the responsibility for administering and
enforcing the provisions of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1 et seq., and the Commissionâs
Regulations promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1.1 et seg. (2014).

Christopher Valois resides in Irvine, California. Valois was registered with
the Commission intermittently between 1998 and 2009 as a CTA, introducing
broker (âIBâ) and associated person (âAPâ). However, since August 2009, Valois
has not been registered with the Commission in any capacity. In August 2010, the
National Futures Association (âNFAâ), the self-regulatory organization designated
by Plaintiff CFTC to register futures industry professionals, permanently barred

Valois from NFA membership for making deceptive and misleading sales
solicitations, using misleading and deceptive promotional material, and
unauthorized trading of customer accounts, among other things. In the NFAâs
decision to permanently bar Valois, it found that âValois has no regard for the
[futures] regulatory structure . . . and poses a threat to customer protection.â

Cynthia Wong resides in Irvine, California. Wong was never been
registered with the Commission in any capacity. Wong is married to Valois.
Wong formed Bertram Trade and operated it with Valois.

Bertram Trade LLC is a California limited liability company which had a
business address of 7 Cobalt Drive, Dana Point, California 92629 from March
2009 to October 2011. Valois and Wong formed Bertram Trade in March 2009
and shut it down in approximately October 2011. During that period Valois and
Wong controlled Bertram Trade and were responsible for Bertram Tradeâs
operations, solicitation of clients, and receipt and use of customer funds. Bertram
Trade maintained a website at www.bertramtrade.com during the same time
period. Bertram Trade offered leveraged investments in precious metals to retail
customers. Bertram Trade has never been registered with the Commission in any
capacity.

Churchhill Commodities Trading LLC is a California limited liability
company which has used a business address of 17266 Candleberry, Irvine,
California 92612 since March 2012. Valois and Wong formed Churchill in March

2012 after shutting Bertram down. During that period Valois controlled Churchhill
and was responsible for its operations, solicitation of clients, and receipt and use of
customer funds. Churchillâs website at www.churchillcommoditiestrading.com is
identical to Bertram Tradeâs former website and until recently was still active.
Churchill has never been registered with the Commission in any capacity.

B. Defendantsâ Conduct

In 2010, the NFA barred Defendant Valois from NFA membership for
defrauding customers. Valois and his wife, Wong, subsequently formed Bertram
Trade, and then Churchhill, through which they fraudulently solicited, managed or
obtained $737,000 from six customers.

Customers tendered $352,500 of those funds ostensibly to purchase
leveraged purchase precious metals through Bertram Trade and Churchhill. The
customer funds went into bank accounts that Valois and Wong controlled.

Defendants claimed, through the Bertram Trade and Churchill websites, to
buy, store and insure leveraged precious metals for customers and claimed that
customers could access the precious metals at any time. However, Defendants did
not provide any precious metals to customers. Of the $352,500 invested for the
purpose of purchasing precious metals, customers received only $8,100 back, and
no customer ever received any precious metals. Instead, Defendants used the
overwhelming majority of the fundsâ$344,400âto pay their personal expenses
and Bertram Tradeâs and Churchhillâs business and operational expenses.

One of Valois and Wongâs customers was a 73 year old retiree (âStenlundâ),
who lost over $400,000 in retirement funds investing in precious metals and
managed futures with them. Valois and Wong solicited Stenlund to purchase
precious metals and to trade futures by emphasizing the profitability of both.
However, Stenlund never received any precious metals and his futures accounts
suffered nearly complete losses. Neither Valois nor Wong ever informed Stenlund
about the losses in, and status of, his accounts. When Stenlund ran out of money to
invest, a Bertram Trade account executive who worked with Stenlund threatened
and harassed Stenlund and his wife.

Defendants unlawfully traded another $384,500 of customer funds in
managed futures accounts. In addition to these customers, Valois attempted to
obtain funds from another customer (âDeRozeâ) to trade futures on DeRozeâs
behalf. Valois told DeRoze the funds would be traded in a friendâs name so that
Valois could âget aroundâ the NFA ban, and Valois also directed DeRoze not to
cooperate with any federal regulatory inquiries into his conduct. Defendants were
not registered as commodity trading advisors, as required, to trade customer funds
in managed futures accounts.

IV. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
A. Jurisdiction and Venue are Proper
This Court possesses jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 6c of

the Act, as amended, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1, which authorizes the Commission to seek

injunctive and other relief against any person whenever it shall appear to the
Commission that such person has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in
any act or practice constituting a violation of the Act or any rule, regulation, or
order thereunder. Defendants have engaged, are engaging, or are about to engage
in acts or practices that constitute a violation of the Act and Commission
Regulations.

Venue properly lies with this Court pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act,

7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(e)}, because Defendants reside in and transacted business within
this district and the acts and practices in violation of the Act occurred, are
occurring, or are about to occur, within this district.

B. Entry of Default Judgment Against Defendants is Appropriate

After a partyâs default has been entered, the party who sought the default
may file a motion requesting the entry of a default judgment. Fed. R.Civ.P. Rule
55(b)(2). See also Ring Central, Inc. v. Quimby, 711 F. Supp. 2d 1048, 1057 (N.D.
Cal. 2010). The decision to grant a motion for default judgment is within the
sound discretion of the district court. Fed. R.Civ.P. 55(b); Aldabe v. Aldabe, 616
F.2d 1089, 1092 (9th Cir.1980).

The Ninth Circuit has identified seven factors courts should consider when
determining whether to grant a default judgment: (1) the possibility of prejudice to
plaintiff; (2) the merits of plaintiffs substantive claim; (3) the sufficiency of the
complaint; (4) the sum of money at stake in the action; (5) the possibility of a

dispute concerning the material facts; (6) whether the default was due to excusable
neglect, and; (7) the strong policy underlying the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
favoring decisions on the merits. Eitel v. McCool, 782 F.2d 1470, 1471-72 (9th
Cir.1986). Failure to make a timely answer to a properly served complaint will
justify the entry of a default judgment. Benny v. Pipes, 799 F.2d 489, 492 (9th Cir.
1986).

In a default, the well-pled factual allegations of the complaint, except those
relating to the amount of damages, will be taken as true. Geddes v. United Fin.
Group, 559 F.2d 557, 560 (9th Cir. 1977) (citing Pope v. United States, 323 U.S. 1,
12 (1944); Flaks v. Koegel, 504 F.2d 702, 707 (2d Cir. 1974)). A default judgment
may be entered without a hearing on damages, however, when the amount claimed
is liquidated or capable of ascertainment from the definite figures contained in the
documentary evidence or in detailed affidavits. See, e.g. Franchise Holding II,
LLC v. Huntington Rest. Group, Inc., 375 F.3d 922, 929 (9th Cir. 2004); Davis v.
Fendler, 650 F.2d 1154, 1161 (9th Cir. 1981). Thereafter, the judgment entered by
default is treated as a conclusive and final adjudication of the issues necessary to
justify the relief awarded. Danning v. Lavine, 572 F.2d 1386, 1388 (9th Cir. 1978)
(citing Thompson, 114 U.S. at 113-14; Geddes v. United Fin. Group, 559 F.2d 557
(9th Cir. 1977)).

The Commissionâs Complaint contains well-pled allegations that establish
the necessary elements for each cause of action against the Defendants.

Defendants were served with the pleadings, yet have failed to participate in any
aspect of this litigation, and the Commissionâs interest in enforcing the Act would
be prejudiced if such default judgment is not entered. Further, as supported by the
Commissionâs Application and Memorandum In Support of Application For Entry
of Default Judgment and documents referenced therein, entry of this judgment is
warranted.

C. Violations of the Commodity Exchange Act

The well-pled allegations of the Complaint establish that Defendants

violated certain provisions of the Act and the Regulations and that a reasonable
likelihood of a future violation exists. Therefore, the issuance of the permanent
injunctive relief requested by the Commission is justified.

1. Defendants Violated Section 4(a) of the Act By Offering and
Entering Into, Off-Exchange Precious Metals Transactions

Section 4(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6(a), as applied to retail commodity
transactions, makes it illegal for any person to offer to enter into, enter into,
execute, confirm the execution of, or conduct any office or business anywhere in
the United States for the purpose of soliciting, or accepting any order for, or
otherwise dealing in retail commodity transactions unless the transactions are
conducted on a regulated exchange.

Valois and Wong operated businesses (Bertram Trade and Churchhill) in the
United States through which they obtained $352,500 from customers for the

purpose of soliciting and accepting orders for retail commodity transactions,

specifically precious metals transactions. Defendantsâ precious metals transactions
were not conducted on a regulated exchange and no customers ever received any
precious metals. Therefore, Defendants offer and entry into these transactions
violated Section 4(a) of the Act.

2. Defendants Violated Section 4b(a) of the Act By Defrauding
Customers

Section 4b(a) of the Act, in pertinent part, prohibits any person from
cheating, defrauding or deceiving any other person in or in connection with the
offering or entering into retail commodity transactions. Section 4b(a) of the Act
prohibits fraud in connection with retail commodity transactions under Section
4b(a)(2)(A) and (C) as well as fraud in connection with commodity futures
contracts under Section 4b(a)(1)(A) and (C). Fraud under Section 4b(a) of the Act
may be proven by misrepresentations or omission of material fact or by
misappropriation. To establish misrepresentation and omission liability under
Section 4b(a) of the Act, the Commission must prove that: (1) a misrepresentation,
misleading statement, or omission was made; (2) with scienter; and (3) that the
misrepresentation, statement or omission was material. CFTC v. R.J. Fitzgerald &
Co., Inc., 310 F.3d 1321, 1328 (11th Cir. 2002), cert. denied, 125 S.Ct. 808 (2004)
(citations omitted). Misappropriating customer funds also violates Section
4b(a)(2)(A) and (C). See, e.g., CFTC v. Noble Wealth Data Info. Servs., Inc., 90 F.
Supp. 2d 676, 687 (D. Md. 2000) (defendants violated Section 4b(a)(2)(i) and (iii)

(the predecessor to 4b(a)(2)(A) and (C)) by diverting investor funds for operating

expenses and personal use), aff'd, CFTC v. Baragosh, 278 F.3d 319 (4th Cir.), cert.
denied, 537 U.S. 950 (2002).

Here Defendants violated Section 4b(a) of the Act by knowingly or with
reckless disregard for the truth or falsity, misrepresenting and omitting material |
facts to customers, including falsely representing that they bought, stored, insured,
and would provide customers with precious metals; misrepresented the likelihood
of profit and failed to disclose losses incurred in the trading commodity futures
contracts in managed futures accounts; and misappropriated customer funds.
Therefore, Defendants fraudulent misconduct and misappropriation of customer
money violated Sections 4b(a)(1)(A),(C) and 4b(a)(2)(A),(C) of the Act.

3. Valois and Wong Violated Section 4m(1) of the Act By Operating
As Unregistered Commodity Trading Advisors

Section 4m(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6m(1), makes it unlawful for any CTA
to make use of the mails or any means of the instrumentalities of interstate
commerce in connection with its business as a CTA unless registered under the
Act. A CTA is any person who, for compensation or profit, engages in the
business of advising others either directly or through publications, writings or
electronic media, as to the value or the advisability of trading in any contract of
sale of a commodity for future delivery ... or for compensation or profit, and as
part of a regular business, issues or promulgates analyses or reports concerning any

of the activities referred to above. Section la(12) of the Act, 7U.S.C. Â§ la(i2).

Defendants Valois and Wong violated Section 4m(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
Â§ 6m(1), by, while making use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of
interstate commerce and for compensation or profit, trading $384,500 of customer
funds in managed futures accounts without being registered with the Commission
as CTAs. Therefore, Valois and Wong managed futures accounts for customers
without the required registration in violation of Section 4m(1) of the Act.

4. Valois and Wong Violated Section 40(1)(A) and (B) of the Act by
Engaging in CTA Fraud

Section 40(1)(A) and (B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 60(1)(A),(B), makes it
unlawful for a CTA to make use of the mails or any means or instrumentalities of
interstate commerce, directly or indirectly to (A) employ any device, scheme, or
artifice to defraud any client or prospective client; or (B) to engage in any
transaction or course of business which operates as a fraud or deceit upon any
client or prospective client.

Defendants Valois and Wong violated Section 40(1)(A) and (B) of the Act,
by, while acting as a CTA over managed futures accounts, knowingly or with
reckless disregard for the truth or falsity, misrepresenting and omitting material
facts to customers, including misrepresenting the likelihood of profit, failing to
disclose losses incurred in trading commodity futures accounts, and
misappropriating customer funds. Therefore, Valois and Wong engaged in fraud
and misappropriation while operating as CTAs in violation of Section 40(1)(A) and

(B) of the Act.

5. Controlling Person and Principal-Agent Liability

Valois controlled Bertram Trade and Churchhill, directly or indirectly, and
did not act in good faith or knowingly induced, directly or indirectly, Bertram
Tradeâs and Churchhillâs act or acts in violation of the Act; therefore, pursuant to
Section 13(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13c(b) (2012), Valois is liable for Bertram
Tradeâs and Churchhillâs respective violations of Sections 4(a), 4b(a)(1)(A) and
(C), 4b(a)(2)(A) and (C), 4m(1) and 40(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6(a),
6b(a)(1)(A),(C), 6b(a)(2)(A),(C), 6m(1), and 60(1) (2012).

Wong controlled Bertram Trade, directly or indirectly, and did not act in
good faith or knowingly induced, directly or indirectly, Bertram Tradeâs act or acts
in violation of the Act; therefore, pursuant to Section 13(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§
13c(b) (2012), Wong is liable for Bertram Tradeâs violations of Sections 4(a),
4b(a)(1)(A) and (C), 4b(a)(2)(A) and (C), 4m(1) and 40(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
Â§Â§ 6(a), 6b(a)(1)(A),(C), 6b(a)(2)(A),(C), 6m(1), and 60(1) (2012).

The foregoing acts, omissions, and failures of Valois and Wong occurred
within the scope of their employment, office, or agency with Bertram Trade and
Churchhill; therefore, pursuant to Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.

Â§ 2(a)(1)(B) (2012), and Regulation 1.2, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.2 (2014), Bertram Trade
and Churchhill are liable for Valoisâ and Wongâs acts, omissions, and failures in

violation of Sections 4(a), 4b(a)(1)(A) and (C), 4b(a)(2)(A) and (C), 4m(1) and

60(1) (2012).
D. Permanent Injunction

Section 6c(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(a), authorizes district courts to
issue injunctions for violations of the Act upon a proper showing by the
Commission. To make a proper showing, the Commission must establish that a
person violated and Is likely to continue violating the Act, the latter of which may
be inferred from past unlawful conduct. CFTC v. Co Petro Marketing Group, Inc.,
680 F.2d 566, 583 (9th Cir. 1981); CFTC v. British American Commodity Options
Corp., 560 F.2d 135 at 142 (2â¢ Cir. 1977). The Commission has adequately
demonstrated that Defendants engaged in fraud, unregistered CTA activity, and
misappropriation of customer funds, and that there is a reasonable likelihood of
future violations.

ORDER OF PERMANENT INJUNCTION AND
OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF

Based upon the foregoing, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that:
A. Permanent Injunction
l. Based upon and in connection with the foregoing conduct, pursuant to
Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2012), Defendants are permanently

April 30, 2015

Federal Court Orders California Residents Christopher Valois and Cynthia Wong and Their
Companies to Pay over $1.1 Million for Fraud and Registration Violations

Washington DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced that Judge Cormac J.
Carney of the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered an Order of Default Judgment against
Defendants Christopher Valois and Cynthia Wong, both residents of Irvine, California, and their companies, Bertram
Trade LLC and Churchhill Commodities Trading LLC. The Order requires the Defendants jointly to pay restitution of
$448,371 and a $700,000 civil monetary penalty. The Order also imposes permanent trading and registration bans
against them.

The Order stems from a CFTC Complaint filed on January 28, 2015 (see CFTC Complaint and Press Release 7114-15),
charging the Defendants with precious metals and futures fraud, misappropriation, engaging in illegal off-exchange
precious metals transactions, and registration violations in violation of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC
Regulations.

The Order finds that Defendants Valois and Wong fraudulently solicited, managed, or obtained $737,000 from six
customers through Bertram Trade and Churchhill. The Order further finds that Defendants falsely advertised on the
companiesâ websites that they would to buy, store, and insure leveraged precious metals for customers and claimed that
customers could access the precious metals at any time. However, according to the Order, the Defendants did not
provide any precious metals to customers, and instead misappropriated over $340,000 of customersâ funds by using
customer funds for personal and business expenses. Further, the Order finds that Valois, who had been banned from
membership by the National Futures Association in 2010, and his wife, Wong, acted as unregistered commodity trading
advisors by managing over $380,000 of customer funds in managed futures accounts when they were never registered
with the CFTC to do so.

Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, leveraged transactions such as those
conducted by Defendants are illegal off-exchange transactions unless they result in actual delivery of metal within 28
days. According to the Order, the Defendants never actually delivered any precious metals to any of their customers.

The CFTC cautions victims that restitution orders may not result in the recovery of money lost because the wrongdoers
may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers and to
ensure the wrongdoers are held accountable.

The CFTC appreciates the cooperation of the National Futures Association in this matter.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Camille Arnold, Joseph Patrick, Robert Howell,
Scott Williamson, and Rosemary Hollinger.

metals scams.

THIS MATTER is before the Court on the U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commissionâs Ex Parte Emergency Motion for Restraining Order in
Accordance with Section 6(a) of the Commodity Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C.Â§
13a-1(a) (2012) [Doc. 3].

The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ of
âCFTC"") has filed a Complaint for Permanent Injunction and Other Relief and
has moved, pursuant to Section 6c(a) of the Commodity Exchange Act (the
âActâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(a) (2012), for an ex parte restraining order enjoining

defendants Barry Taylor (âTaylorâ), OTC Investments LLC (OTC.

Investmentsâ), and Forex Currency Trading Advisors, LLC (âFCT Advisorsâ)
(collectively, âDefendantsâ) from destroying, altering, or disposing of, or
refusing to permit authorized representatives of the Commission to inspect
and copy any books or records or other documents, including electronically
stored information (""ESI""), and further enjoining the Defendants from
withdrawing, transferring, removing, dissipating, or disposing of any funds,
assets or other property. Having considered the pleadings, declarations,
exhibits, and memorandum filed in support of the Commissionâs motion for a
restraining order, THIS COURT HEREBY FINDS:

1. | This Court has jurisdiction over the parties and over the subject
matter of this action pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1
(2012), and Section 2(c)(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(c)(2) (2012).

2. This Court is authorized by Section 6c(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§
13a-1(a), to issue a statutory restraining order against the Defendants.

3. Venue lies properly within this District pursuant to Section 6c(e)
of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 13a-1(e) (2012).

4. It appears to the satisfaction of the Court that the Plaintiff has
presented a prima facie case, and further has shown by competent evidence
that there is a substantial likelihood that the Plaintiff will prevail on the merits

of this matter in showing, that the Defendants have engaged, are engaging,

and are about to engage in certain unlawful conduct, including, but not limited
to: making affirmative material misrepresentations to pool participants
and/or prospective pool participants, misappropriating pool participantsâ
funds, acting as an unlawfully unregistered commodity pool operator (âCPOâ)
or an unlawfully unregistered associated person (âAPâ) of a CPO, improperly
commingling pool participantsâ funds with personal and other business-
related funds, and engaging in other acts, practices or a course of business
that defrauded pool participants or prospective pool participants, operated
as a fraud or deceit on pool participants, cheated or defrauded or attempted
to cheat or defraud other persons, or willfully deceived or attempted to
deceive other persons in connection with a pooled investment vehicle that is
not an eligible contract participant (âECPâ), as defined by Section 1a(11) of
the Commodity Exchange Act, as amended (âActâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1a(11) (2012),
in connection with leveraged, margined or financed foreign currency
transactions (âforexâ) as described in Section 2(c)(2)(C)(i) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
Â§ 2(c)(2)(C)(i) (which are subject to the anti-fraud provisions of Section
Ab(a)(2)(A) and (C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6b(a)(2)(A), (C), pursuant to
Sections 2(c)(2)(C)ii)(l) and 2(c)(2)(C\iv) of the Act, 7 USC. Â§Â§
2(c)(2)(C)ii)(1), 2(c)(2)(C)(iv)), in violation of Sections 2(c)(2)(C)(iiI)()(cc),

Ab(a)(2)(A), (C), and 40(1)(A)-(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 2(c)(2)(C)(iii)(1)(cc),

6b(a)(2)(A), (C) and 60(1)(A)-(B) (2012), and Commission Regulation
5.3(a)(2)(i) and (ii), 17 C.F.R. Â§5.3(a)(2)(i) and (ii) (2014).

5. It appears to the satisfaction of the Court that there is a
substantial likelihood that the Defendantsâ violations of the Act and
Regulations are likely to continue unless they are restrained and enjoined
from committing further violations.

6. It appears to the satisfaction of the Court that there is a
substantial likelihood that the Defendantsâ customers may be cheated and
defrauded and immediate and irreparable damage will occur to the Courtâs
ability to grant effective final relief in the form of monetary redress due to the
dissipation of customer assets and destruction of books and records unless
the Defendants are immediately restrained and enjoined by order of the
Court. Further, the Court finds that balance of hardships tips in the Plaintiff's
favor, as the potential harm to the public in not granting the requested
restraining order outweighs the potential harm to the Defendants in granting
the requested relief.

7. It further appears to the satisfaction of the Court that there is a
substantial likelihood that absent the entry of this restraining order, the

Defendants are likely to dissipate or transfer assets and destroy business

records.

Case 1:15-cv-00081-MR *SEALED* Document 11 Filed 04/22/15 Page 4 of 11

 
8. Consequently, the Court CONCLUDES as a matter of law that a
statutory restraining order should issue ex parte in order to preserve the
status quo, protect public customers from loss and damage, and enable the
Commission to fulfill its statutory duties.

CFTC Charges North Carolina Resident Barry C. Taylor and His Companies with Commodity
Pool Fraud in a Multi-Million Dollar Fraudulent Forex Scheme and with Registration
Violations

Federal Court Enters Emergency Order Freezing Defendantsâ Assets and
Protecting Books and Records

Defendantsâ Fraudulent Scheme Allegedly Solicited over $2.4 Million
from Approximately 24 Members of the Public

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) filed a civil enforcement Complaint against
Barry C. Taylor of Franklin, North Carolina, charging him with operating a multi-million dollar fraudulent scheme
through his firms, OTC Investments LLC and Forex Currency Trade Advisors, LLC (collectively, Defendants). On
April 22, 2015, Judge Martin Reidinger of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina, Asheville
Division entered an emergency restraining Order freezing Defendantsâ assets and prohibiting the destruction or
concealment of their books and records. None of the Defendants has ever been registered with the CFTC, as is required.

The CFTC Complaint, filed under seal on April 21, 2015, alleges that from at least August 1, 2011 through the present,
the Defendants engaged in a fraudulent scheme that solicited more than $2.4 million from approximately 24 members of
the public in North Carolina and other states within the United States and in Canada to participate in a commodity pool
that traded leveraged or margined retail off-exchange foreign currency (forex) contracts.

The Complaint further alleges that Taylor misappropriated pool participant funds for personal and other business uses,
and to conceal his fraudulent scheme and misappropriation. Also, as alleged, Taylor issued or caused to be issued false
account statements to one or more pool participants to cover up his fraudulent scheme.

Taylor, among other things, allegedly made material misrepresentations and omissions to commodity pool participants
that 1) Defendants were engaged in profitable forex trading and 2) failed to disclose that Defendants traded only a
portion of pool participant funds and misappropriated the remainder through a combination of personal expenditures and
partial distributions of diminishing commodity pool funds to pool participants to lull and deceive them.

The Complaint also charges that the Defendants used pool participant funds to pay purported trading profits and
supposedly returned pool participantsâ principal in the manner of a Ponzi scheme.

In its continuing litigation, the CFTC seeks a return of ill-gotten gains, restitution, civil monetary penalties, trading and
registration bans, and permanent injunctions against further violations of the federal commodities laws, as charged.

The CFTC cautions victims that restitution orders may not result in the recovery of money lost because the wrongdoers
may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers and to
ensure the wrongdoers are held accountable.

The CFTC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of North Carolina and the
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are JonMarc P. Buffa, Peter M. Haas, Patricia A.
Gomersall, Tashieka Taylor, and Paul G. Hayeck.

ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTIONS 6(c) AND 6(d) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, AS AMENDED,
MAKING FINDINGS AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

I.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ) has reason to believe that
from at least 2008 until May 15, 2013 (the âRelevant Periodâ), FCStone LLC (âFCStoneâ or
âRespondentâ) violated Commission Regulation (âRegulationâ) 166.3, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 166.3 (2014).
Therefore, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest that public
administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted to determine whether Respondent
engaged in the violations set forth herein and to determine whether any order should be issued
imposing remedial sanctions,

II.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Respondent has
submitted an Offer of Settlement (âOfferâ), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Without admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, Respondent consents to
the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 6(c) and 6(d) of the
Commodity Exchange Act, as Amended, Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions
(âOrderâ) and acknowledge service of this Order.'

 

Respondent consents to the entry of this Order and to the use of these findings in this

proceeding and in any other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission
is a party; provided, however, that Respondent does not consent to the use of the Offer, or the
findings or conclusions in this Order consented to in the Offer, as the sole basis for any other
proceeding brought by the Commission, other than in a proceeding in bankruptcy or to enforce
the terms of this Order. Nor does Respondent consent to the use of the Offer or this Order, or the
findings or conclusions in this Order consented to in the Offer, by any other party in any other
proceeding.
III.
The Commission finds the following:
A, SUMMARY

FCStone had inadequate procedures in place to govern the transfer of positions between
customer accounts held at the firm, had not adequately trained its personnel on the circumstances
of when such transfers may occur, and on one occasion failed to diligently supervise the handling
by its employees of certain commodity interest accounts carried at the firm in violation of
Regulation 166.3, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 166.3 (2014).

B. RESPONDENT

FCStone, LLC (âFCStoneâ) is a Futures Commission Merchant (âFCMâ) and
Commodity Trading Advisor registered with the Commission since March 6, 2000 and August 8,
2012, respectively. FCStone is a subsidiary of FCStone Group Inc., which was acquired in
September 2009 by International Assets Holding Corporation. International Assets Holding
Corporation changed its name to INTL FCStone Inc. in 2011 and is a publicly-held company
traded on the NASDAQ under the symbol âINTLâ.

C. FACTS

A clearing member, like Respondent, may transfer trades or positions among customersâ
commodity accounts held at the firm so long as the transfer is merely from one account to
another account that has the same beneficial ownership. Indeed, from at least 2008 to the
present, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (âCMEâ) has had a rule to that effect governing the
transfer of positions between customersâ commodity accounts held at a firm.â

Respondentâs Compliance Manual in effect during the Relevant Period did not have
policies or procedures governing the transfer of positions between customersâ accounts, and
FCStone had no set written policy governing a request by a customer to transfer positions
between accounts. Instead, FCStone had an unwritten policy such that its employees understood
that they were to seek guidance if a transfer was requested between two accounts that were not
under common control. That unwritten policy, however, did not provide specific guidance
regarding the impact of beneficial ownership on account transfers. In particular, transfers
between accounts can only occur when (i) the transfer merely constituted a change from one
account to another account and (11) the underlying beneficial ownership in the two accounts
remained the same.

 

2 In substance, during the Relevant Period, CME Rule 853, which is titled âTransfer of

Trades,â required that existing trades may be transferred on the books of a clearing member so
long as the transfer merely constitutes a change from one account to another account provided
the underlying beneficial ownership in the accounts remains the same. In March of 2014, the
CME amended Rule 853.A(1)(i) to state that trades may be transferred on the books of a clearing
member only when the transfer results in the transfer of trade(s) from one account to another
account with âidenticalâ beneficial ownership.
In May 2013 FCStone transferred positions between two accounts that did not have the
same underlying beneficial ownership. In particular, FCStone was the clearing FCM for an
individual precious metals supplier located in the United Arab Emirates. On May 2, 2013, the
individual orally requested that Respondent transfer approximately $20 Million in gold and silver
positions from his personal account to a corporate account in which he was 98.95% owner.
Respondentâs employees made the transfer believing that, because the individual and corporate
accounts had the same large trader number and the individual controlled both accounts, the
positions could be transferred between the two accounts. In actuality, however, the tax
identification numbers for the two accounts were different, and the accounts did not have the
same underlying beneficial ownership because there were two fractional minority owners of the
corporate account.

Subsequently, before it was contacted by the Commission concerning the matters
addressed in this Order, FCStone revised its written procedures concerning the transfer of
positions between customersâ accountsâ and, on or about May 15, 2013, on its own and without
being prompted by the Commission, updated its Compliance Manual. Among other things,
FCStone now included a new subsection titled âTransfers Between Accounts.â Specifically, this
new subsection provides:

âIn general, transfers of positions may be made between two accounts carried by
the Firm only if such transfer does not result in any change in the beneficial
ownership of the positions. In addition, such transfers may be made only upon
receipt of a written request by the beneficial owner stating: (i) the relevant
positions to be transferred; (ii) the accounts involved; and if necessary (iii) that
the accounts involved are beneficially owned by the same person or entity. Under
certain circumstances, additional or alternative documentation may be required to
affect the transfer.â

Additionally, since updating its Compliance Manual to include the new subsection
concerning the procedures for transferring positions between customersâ commodity accounts,
FCStone has provided adequate training to its supervisors and/or employees on its new
procedures.

Further, FCStone cooperated fully with the Commissionâs investigation into the matters
described in this Order.

IV. LEGAL DISCUSSION
Regulation 166.3, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 166.3 (2014), requires:

 

3 FCStone revised its written procedures in part because, on May 3, 2013, a large margin

call was issued in the corporate account to which the positions had been transferred the previous
day, and FCStone then realized that the two accounts did not have the same underlying beneficial
ownership.
Each Commission registrant, except an associated person who has no supervisory
duties, must diligently supervise the handling by its partners, officers, employees
and agents (or persons occupying a similar status or performing a similar
function) of all commodity interest accounts carried, operated, advised or
introduced by the registrant and all other activities of its partners, officers,
employees and agents (or persons occupying a similar status or performing a
similar function) relating to its business as a Commission registrant.

A violation under Regulation 166.3, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 166.3 (2014), is an independent
violation for which no underlying violation is necessary. See Jn re Collins, [1996-1998 Transfer
Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) 4 27,194 at 45,744 (CFTC Dec. 10, 1997).

A violation of Regulation 166.3, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 166.3 (2014), is demonstrated by showing
either that: (1) the registrantâs supervisory system was generally inadequate; or (2) the registrant
failed to perform its supervisory duties diligently. Jn re Murlas Commodities, [1994-1996
Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L Rep. (CCH) Â§ 26,485 at 43,161 (CFTC Sept. 1, 1995); In re
GNP Commodities, Inc., [1990-1992 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) { 25,360 at
39,219 (CFTC Aug. 11, 1992) (providing that, even if an adequate supervisory system is in
place, Regulation 166.3 can still be violated if the supervisory system is not diligently
administered), aff'd sub nom. Monieson v. CFTC, 996 F.2d 852 (7th Cir.); In re Paragon Futures
Assoc., (1990-1992 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) 4 25,266 at 38,850 (CFTC Apr.
1, 1992) (âThe focus of any proceeding to determine whether Rule 166.3 has been violated will
be on whether [a] review [has] occurred and, if it did, whether it was diligentâ); Samson Refining
Co. v. Drexel Burnham Lambert, Inc. [1987-1990 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH)

{ 24,596 at 36,566 (CFTC Feb. 16 1990) (noting that, under Regulation 166.3, an FCM has a
âduty to develop procedures for the detection and deterrence of possible wrongdoing by its
agentsâ)(internal quotation omitted). Evidence of violations that âshould be detected by a
diligent system of supervision, either because of the nature of the violations or because the
violations have occurred repeatedlyâ is probative of a failure to supervise. Jn re Paragon
Futures Assoc., | 25,266 at 38,850; CFTC v. Sidoti, 178 F.3d 1132, 1137 (11th Cir. 1999)
(defendant was liable for failure to supervise because he âknew of specific instances of
misconduct, yet failed to take reasonable steps to correct the problemsâ).

Further, while the absence of a written policy or formal training on every issue does not
constitute a failure to supervise, Regulation 166.3 requires all registered FCMs to diligently
supervise all activities of its officers, employees, and agents relating to its business as an FCM.
See 17 C.F .R. Â§ 166.3 (2014). Thus, an FCM may violate Regulation 166.3 even if it does not
violate any specific supervisory requirement imposed by either statutory provision or regulatory
rulemaking and âa showing that the registrant lacks an adequate supervisory system, standing
alone, can be sufficientâ to demonstrate a violation of Regulation 166.3. In re Paragon, Â§ 25,266
at 38,850.

During the Relevant Period, FCStone had inadequate compliance policies and procedures
governing the transfer of positions between customer accounts held at FCStone, inadequate
training for its personnel on the circumstances of when such transfers may occur, and failed to
perform its supervisory duties diligently by permitting its employees to transfer approximately
$20 Million in gold and silver positions between two accounts that did not have the same
underlying beneficial ownership.

V. FINDINGS OF VIOLATION

Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that, during the Relevant Period, FCStone
violated Regulation 166.3, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 166.3 (2014).

CFTC Sanctions FCStone, LLC for Supervision Violations

Firm Ordered to Pay $140,000 Civil Penalty

Washington, DC â The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) entered an Order filing and simultaneously
settling charges against FCStone, LLC, a CFTC-registered Futures Commission Merchant (FCM) headquartered in New
York, New York, for failing to provide and maintain an adequate program of supervision and for failing to diligently
supervise its employees on one occasion in violation of CFTC Regulation 166.3.

The CFTC Order requires FCStone to pay a $140,000 civil monetary penalty and to cease and desist from violating CFTC
Regulation 166.3, as charged.

Specifically, the Order finds that, from at least 2008 until May 2013, FCStone did not have adequate policies or
procedures governing the transfer of positions between customersâ accounts, and no set written policy governing a
request by a customer to transfer positions between accounts. Instead, FCStone had an unwritten policy such that its
employees understood that they were to seek guidance if a transfer was requested between two accounts that were not
under common control. That unwritten policy, however, did not provide specific guidance regarding the impact of
beneficial ownership on account transfers, according to the Order. In particular, an FCM, like FCStone, may transfer
positions among customersâ commodity accounts held at the firm 1) so long as the transfer merely constitutes a change
from one account to another account, and 2) the underlying beneficial ownership in the two accounts remains the same,
according to the Order.

The Order also finds that on one occasion FCStoneâs employees transferred positions between two accounts that did not
have the same underlying beneficial ownership. Specifically, they transferred approximately $20 million in gold and silver
positions from an individualâs personal account to a corporate account in which the individual was a 98.95 percent owner.
They made the transfer believing that, because the individual and corporate accounts had the same large trader number
and the individual controlled both accounts, the positions could be transferred between the two accounts. In actuality,
however, the tax identification numbers for the two accounts were different, and the accounts did not have the same
underlying beneficial ownership because there were two fractional minority owners of the corporate account.

The Order further finds that FCStone cooperated fully with the CFTCâs investigation into this matter and that FCStone, on
its own, revised its written procedures concerning the transfer of positions accordingly.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this matter are James Deacon and Rick Glaser.

Plaintiff U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the âCFTCâ or âCommissionâ)
applies to this Court, pursuant to Section 6c of the Commodity Exchange Act (the Actâ), as
amended by the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-246, Title XII,
Â§Â§ 13101-13204, 122 Stat. 1651 (enacted June 18, 2008), and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street
Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, Pub. L. No. 111-203, Title VII, Â§Â§ 701-774, 124
Stat. 1376 (enacted July 21, 2010), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2006 & Supp. IV 2011), for entry of an ex
parte statutory restraining order, providing the following relief:

1. Freezing all of the assets of the Defendants;

2. Prohibiting Defendants and any person(s) acting or purporting to act for or on
their behalf, from destroying or altering any books, records, or other documents
and barring Defendants and their agents from denying access to those books,

records, and documents to any representative of the Commission;
3. Granting leave to engage in expedited discovery in order to determine the full

extent of Defendantsâ alleged wrongdoing, locate any other customers, identify
customer funds and other assets of the Defendants, and clarify the source and

whereabouts of various funds; and

. Granting permission to serve Defendants via email;

. Ordering the Defendants to appear before this Court to show cause why this Court

should not enter a preliminary injunction enjoining the Defendants from further
violating the Act as amended, continuing the relief granted in the Statutory
Restraining Order, and ordering any additional relief this Court deems

appropriate.

The Court has considered the Complaint, the Declaration of Andrew Vrabel, and the

Memorandum of Law of the Commission in Support of Its Application for an Ex Parte Statutory

Restraining Order and Order to Show Cause Regarding Preliminary Injunction, and now, being

fully advised in the premises, finds that:

1.

This Court has jurisdiction over the parties and over the subject matter of this
action and is authorized to grant ex parte relief pursuant to Section 6c of the Act,
7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1.

Venue lies properly within this District pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act, 7
U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(e).

There is good cause to believe that the Defendants by and through their agents,
principals, and control persons have engaged in, are engaging in, or are about to
engage in trading practiced or conduct on or subject to the rules of a registered

entity that is, is of the character of, or is commonly known as spoofing (bidding or
offering with the intent to cancel the bid or offer before execution), in violation of
Section 4c(a)(5)(C) of the Commodity Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6c(a)(5)(C);
There is good cause for the Court to freeze assets owned, controlled, managed, or
held by or on behalf of, or for the benefit, of Defendants;

There is good cause for entry of an order prohibiting Defendants, their agents,
servants, employees, assigns, attorneys, and persons acting in active concert or
participation with the Defendants, including any successor thereof, from
destroying records and/or denying agents of the Commission access to inspect and
copy records to ensure that Commission representatives have immediate and
complete access to those books and records;

There is good cause for the Plaintiff to conduct expedited discovery in order to
determine the full extent of Defendantsâ alleged wrongdoing, locate any other
customers, identify customer funds and other assets of the Defendants, and clarify
the source and whereabouts of various funds;

Absent the entry of this statutory restraining order, the Defendants are likely to
dissipate or transfer assets, destroy, or otherwise prevent access to business
records;

This is a proper case for granting an ex parte statutory restraining order to
preserve the status quo, to protect public customers, clients or participants from

loss and damage and enable the Commission to fulfill its statutory duties;

Therefore, the Court orders as follows:

DEFINITIONS

For the purposes of this Order, the following definitions apply:
10.

The term âassetâ means any legal or equitable interest in, right to, or claim to, any

CFTC Charges United Arab Emirates Residents Heet Khara and Nasim Salim with Spoofing
in the Gold and Silver Futures Markets

Court Issues an Ex Parte Restraining Order Freezing Defendantsâ Assets
and Preserving Records

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced the filing of a civil
enforcement action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Heet Khara and Nasim
Salim, residents of the United Arab Emirates. According to the CFTCâs Complaint, Defendants engaged in unlawful
disruptive trading practices known as âspoofingâ in the gold and silver futures markets by placing bids and offers with the
intent to cancel them before execution.

Based on Defendantsâ pattern of unlawful spoofing conduct and the potential for dissipation of Defendantsâ assets, on
May 5, 2015, U.S. District Judge Deborah A. Batts issued an Order freezing and preserving assets under Defendantsâ
control and prohibiting them from destroying documents or denying CFTC staff access to their books and records. The
court scheduled a hearing on the CFTCâs motion for a preliminary injunction for May 19, 2015.

The Complaint alleges that between at least February 2015 and at least April 28, 2015, Defendants Khara and Salim,
both individually and in a coordinated fashion, regularly placed larger aggregate orders for gold and silver futures
contracts on the Commodity Exchange, Inc. (COMEX) opposite smaller orders and cancelled the larger orders after the
smaller orders were executed.

CME Group Inc.âs (CME Group) Market Regulation Department identified the disruptive trading practices and initiated an
investigation. On or about April 30, 2015, CME Group issued notices summarily denying Defendants Khara and Salimâs
access to all CME Group markets and any trading platforms owned or controlled by CME Group. CME Group Inc. operates
four self-regulatory organizations and designated contract markets, which are the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc.,
Board of Trade of the City of Chicago, Inc., New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., and COMEX.

CFTC Director of Enforcement Aitan Goelman commented: âProtecting the integrity and stability of the U.S. futures
markets is critical to ensuring a properly functioning financial system. Aggressive prosecution of spoofing is an important
part of that mission. Todayâs actions make clear that the CFTC will partner with self-regulatory organizations to find and
swiftly prosecute those who engage in such disruptive trading practices, wherever they may be.â

In its ongoing litigation, the CFTC is seeking preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, civil monetary penalties, and
equitable relief including trading and registration bans and disgorgement.

The CFTC thanks and acknowledges the assistance of the CME Group in this matter.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this matter are Patryk J. Chudy, David Oakland, Neel Chopra,
Katie Rasor, Trevor Kokal, Lenel Hickson, and Manal Sultan.

In the Matter of:
ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS
PURSUANT TO SECTIONS 6(c) and 6(d)
OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE
ACT, MAKING FINDINGS AND
IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

LIBERO COMMODITIES SA,

Respondent.

Numerâ Nome! Neweggâ Se âteeâ eeeâ eeâ

 

I.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (ââCFTCâ or âCommissionâ) has reason to
believe that Libero Commodities SA (âLiberoâ or âRespondentâ) violated Commission
Regulation (âRegulationâ) 19,02, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 19.02 (2014), since it began trading in May 2010,
and through April 29, 2014 (âRelevant Periodâ). Therefore, the Commission deems it
appropriate and in the public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are,
instituted to determine whether Respondent engaged in the violations set forth herein and to
determine whether any order should be issued imposing remedial sanctions.

II.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Respondent has
submitted an Offer of Settlement of Respondent Libero Commodities SA (âOfferâ), which the
Commission has determined to accept. Without admitting or denying any of the findings and
conclusions herein, Respondent consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings
Pursuant to Sections 6(c) and 6(d) of the Commodity Exchange Act, Making Findings and
Imposing Remedial Sanctions (âOrderâ), and acknowledges service of this Order.â

 

' Respondent consents to the entry of this Order and to the use of these findings in this
proceeding and in any other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission
is a party; provided, however, that Respondent does not consent to the use of the Offer, or the
findings in this Order consented to in the Offer, as the sole basis for any other proceeding
brought by the Commission, other than a proceeding in bankruptcy or to enforce the terms of this
Order. Nor does Respondent consent to the use of the Offer or this Order, or the findings
consented to in the Offer or this Order, by any other party in any other proceeding.
Il.

The Commission finds the following:

A. Summary

Cotton merchants and dealers that hold or control reportable cotton futures positions
under Commission Regulation (âRegulationâ) 15.00(p)(1)(i), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 15.00(p)(1)(1) (2014),
are required to file a CFTC Form 304 reporting their call cotton purchases and sales weekly as of
the close of business on Friday, and no later than two business days following the date of the
report pursuant to Regulations 19.00(a)(2) and 19.02, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 19.00(a)(2), 19.02 (2014).
Throughout the Relevant Period, Respondent failed to comply with this requirement.

B. Respondent

Libero Commodities SA is an agricultural trading company with its principal office
located in Geneva, Switzerland, and maintains another office in Mato Grasso, Brazil. Libero has
never been registered with the Commission in any capacity.

Cc, Facts

Respondent is a cotton merchant or dealer. Whenever cotton merchants or dealers hold
or control at least 100 cotton futures positions, they are required by Regulations to file weekly
CFTC Form 304 reports with the Commission setting forth their call cotton purchases and sales
as of the close of business Friday, and are required to submit their CFTC Form 304 reports
within two business days. On approximately 200 occasions during the Relevant Period,
Respondent held or controlled at least 100 cotton futures positions but failed to file CFTC Form
304 reports as required. Upon discovering its omissions, Respondent voluntarily self-reported its
deficiency to the Commission in May 2014.

In accepting Respondentâs Offer, the Commission recognizes Respondentâs cooperation
in this matter, which included proactively and voluntarily analyzing its past trading activity since
its inception, and retroactively compiling and providing all of the back CFTC Forms 304 that
should have been filed with the Commission.

D. Legal Discussion

Pursuant to Regulation 19.00(a)(2), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 19.00(a)(2) (2014), cotton merchants and
dealers that hold or control reportable cotton futures positions under Regulation 15.00(p)(1)(),
17 C.F.R. Â§ 15.00(p)(1)(i) (2014), are required to file series ""04 reports. Regulation
15.00(p)(1)(), in relevant part, defines a reportable position as any open contract position that
meets or exceeds the level set forth in Regulation 15.03, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 15.03 (2014), in any one
futures contract on any reporting market at the close of the market on any business day. For
cotton futures positions, Regulation 15.03, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 15.03 (2014), establishes 100 contracts as
the reporting level.
For cotton merchants and dealers with reportable positions, âCFTC Form 304 reports
showing the quantity of call cotton bought or sold on which the price has not been fixed, together
with the respective futures on which the purchase or sale is basedâ must be filed. 17 C.F.R. Â§
19.02(a) (2014). Call cotton refers to âspot cotton bought or sold, or contracted for purchase or
sale at a price to be fixed later based upon a specified future.â 17 C.F.R. Â§ 19.02(a) (2014).

Each CFTC Form 304 report must be âmade weekly as of the close of business on Friday and
filed . . . not later than the second business day following the date of the report.â 17 C.F.R. Â§
19,02(b) (2014).

By failing to file CFTC Form 304 reports as set forth above, on approximately 200
occasions during the Relevant Period, Respondent violated Regulation 19.02. See 17 C.F.R. Â§
19.02 (2014).

IV.

19.02, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 19.02 (2014), during the Relevant Period.

8. any claims of double jeopardy based upon the institution of this proceeding or the

CFTC Orders Libero Commodities SA to Pay $480,000 for Call Cotton Reporting Violations

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today issued an Order filing and settling
charges against Libero Commodities SA (Libero), an agricultural trading company, for failing to comply with its legal
obligation as a reportable trader to submit weekly CFTC Form 304 Reports that show its call cotton purchases and sales,
in violation of CFTC Regulation 19.02. Liberoâs principal office is in Geneva, Switzerland, and it maintains another office in
Mato Grasso, Brazil.

The Order requires Libero to pay a $480,000 civil monetary penalty and prohibits it from committing future violations of
the CFTC Regulation, as charged. The Order also states that Libero has adopted written procedures regarding future
compliance with the CFTC cotton reporting Regulation and that Libero will undertake to adopt and maintain internal
controls that are reasonably designed to ensure that it complies fully with those written compliance procedures.

Specifically, the Order finds that, on approximately 200 occasions from when Libero commenced trading in May 2010,
through April 29, 2014, Libero held or controlled at least 100 cotton futures positions, but failed to file weekly CFTC Form
304 Reports as required.

As described in the Order, cotton merchants and dealers that hold or control at least 100 cotton futures positions, the
reportable level for cotton futures contracts under CFTC Regulations, are required to file CFTC Form 304 Reports that
show their call cotton purchases and sales as of the close of business Friday, and no later than two business days
following the date of the report.

According to the Order, call cotton refers to physical cotton bought or sold, or contracted for purchase or sale, at a price
to be fixed later based on a specified delivery monthâs futures price. The CFTC uses information it gathers from CFTC
Form 304 Reports in its weekly Cotton On-Call Reports, published with other Market Reports on the CFTC website.

The CFTC previously issued a market Advisory reminding cotton market participants of their ongoing obligation to comply
in a timely manner with applicable reporting obligations (see CFIC Staff Advisory No. 13-14 (Obligation of Reportable
Market Participants to File CFTC Form 304 Reports for Call Cotton in a Timely Manner as Required by Commission
Regulation 19.02, May 8, 2013).

The CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Elizabeth Davis, Erica Bodin, and Rick
Glaser. The CFTC acknowledges the assistance of Janet Briner, Kelly Beck, Harold Hild, and Matthew Hunter of the CFTCâs
Division of Market Oversight in connection with this matter.

ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO SECTION 6(c) AND 6(d) OF
THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, MAKING FINDINGS,
AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

I,

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ or âCFTCâ) has reason to
believe that during the period between July 2011 through May 2013 (the ârelevant periodâ),
Double Eagle Enterprises, LLC and Double Eagle Metals (collectively âDouble Eagleâ) and their
controlling person, Eric Arlt (âArltâ) (collectively, âRespondentsâ), violated Sections 4(a) and
Ad(a)(1) of the Commodity Exchange Act (âActâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6(a) and 6d(a)(1) (2012).
Therefore, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest that public
administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted to determine whether Respondents
engaged in the violations set forth herein, and to determine whether any order should be issued
imposing remedial sanctions.

I.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Respondents have
submitted an Offer of Settlement (âOfferâ), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Without admitting or denying any of the findings and conclusions herein, Respondents consent
to the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Section 6(c) and 6(d) of the

 
Commodity Exchange Act, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (âOrderââ) and
acknowledge service of this Order. '

Il.
The Commission finds the following:
A. SUMMARY

During the relevant period, Respondents violated Sections 4(a) and 4d(a)(1) of the Act by
offering to enter into, entering into, confirming the execution of, and conducting an office and
business in the United States for the purpose of soliciting, accepting orders for, and otherwise
dealing in illegal, off-exchange retail commodity transactions while failing to be properly
registered. Specifically, the transactions were financed precious metals transactions with
individual investors. Arlt is directly liable for such violations, and is also liable as the
controlling person of Double Eagle. Double Eagle received commissions and fees totaling
$611,154.00 for these transactions.

B. RESPONDENTS

Double Eagle Enterprises, LLC and Double Eagle Metals were Florida corporations
formed on or around July 26, 2006. Double Eagleâs principal place of business was Charlevoix,
Michigan. Double Eagle was a telemarketing firm that solicited retail customers to invest in
financed precious metals transactions. Double Eagle has never been registered with the
Commission in any capacity

Eric Arlt is the incorporator and majority owner of Double Eagle. Arlt is a resident of
Charlevoix, Michigan. At all relevant times herein, Arlt was the controlling person of Double
Eagle. With respect to control, Arlt was the owner and operator of Double Eagle. Arlt managed
the day to day operations, supervising the solicitation of retail customers and engaging in the
solicitations themselves. Arlt was the ultimate decision maker and controlled all aspects of
Double Eagleâs business. Arlt had both general control over Double Eagle and specific control
over the conduct underlying Double Eagleâs violations, i.e., Double Eagle offering to enter into,
entering into, and confirming the execution of retail financed precious metals transactions, and
Double Eagle conducting an office and business in the United States for soliciting, accepting,
and otherwise dealing in retail financed precious metals transactions, Arlt has never been
registered with the Commission in any capacity.

 

' Respondents consent to the entry of this Order and to the use of these findings in this
proceeding and in any other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission
is a party; provided, however, that Respondents do not consent to the use of the Offer, or the
findings or conclusions in this Order consented to in the Offer, as the sole basis for any other
proceeding brought by the Commission, other than in a proceeding in bankruptcy or to enforce
the terms of this Order. Nor do Respondents consent to the use of the Offer or this Order, or the
findings or conclusions in this Order consented to in the Offer, by any other party in any other
proceeding.

 
C. OTHER RELEVANT ENTITIES

Hunter Wise Commodities, LLC was formed as a California limited liability company
in July 2007 but was converted to a Nevada limited liability company in October 2010. It held
itself out on its website as âa physical commodity trading company, wholesaler, market maker,
back-office support provider, and finance company.â During the relevant period, Hunter Wise
executed and confirmed the execution of retail commodity transactions involving gold, silver,
platinum, palladium, and copper throughout the United States using a network of telemarketing
solicitors, such as Double Eagle, that it referred to as âdealers.â

AmeriFirst Management LLC (âAMLâ) is a Florida limited liability company formed
in October 2011. It has never been registered with the Commission in any capacity, On its
website, it claimed to provide dealers with âtangible assets in a growing physical marketâ and
âguarantee[s|] that every ounce of metal in [the dealerâs] customers [sic] account exists and is
ready for delivery at any point in time. During the relevant period, AML executed and
confirmed the execution of retail commodity transactions involving gold, silver, and platinum
through the United States using a network of telemarketing solicitors, such as Double Eagle, that
it referred to as âdealers.â

D. FACTS

During the relevant period, Double Eagle was a telemarketing firm that solicited retail
customers to engage in financed precious metals transactions, Although Double Eagle offered
precious metals on a fully paid basis, the vast majority of its business was in financed precious
metals transactions. This Order relates to the financed precious metals transactions executed
through Hunter Wise and AML.

Double Eagle conducted nearly all of its solicitations by telephone. Arlt, the controlling
person of Double Eagle, directly solicited customers and supervised the other telemarketers
involved in solicitation. When soliciting customers for financed precious metals transactions
executed through Hunter Wise and AML, Arlt and the other Double Eagle telemarketers
represented that to purchase a certain quantity of metal, the customer needed to deposit only a
percentage of the total metal value. Double Eagle represented that the customer would receive a
loan for the remaining value, and that the customer would have to pay a finance charge on the
loan, as well as a service charge. In addition, in order to purchase the metal, Double Eagle
represented that the customer needed to pay commission on the total metal value, and a mark-up
on the spot price of the metal.

If the customer agreed to the transaction, Double Eagle confirmed the transaction and
directed the customer to send Double Eagle a lump sum, which represented the total of the equity
deposit, the commission amount, and the mark-up amount. Upon receipt of those funds, Double
Eagle sent the funds in their entirety to Hunter Wise or AML. Hunter Wise and AML then sent
Double Eagle any commission and fees due. During the relevant period, Double Eagle received
$611,154.00 in commissions and fees for the retail financed precious metals transactions
executed through Hunter Wise and AML.

 
None of Double Eagle, Hunter Wise, or AML bought, sold, loaned, stored, or transferred
any physical metals for these financed precious metals transactions. Likewise, none of Double
Eagle, Hunter Wise, or AML actually delivered any precious metals to any customers. Instead,
Hunter Wise and AML managed exposure on these transactions using derivatives in margin
trading accounts with several entities, CFTC v. Hunter Wise Commodities, LLC, Case No. 9:12-
cv-81311-DMM, slip op. at 12-14 (S.D. Fla, Feb. 19, 2014) (order granting summary judgment).

IV.
LEGAL DISCUSSION
A, Relevant Statutory Background

Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010,
Public Law 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376 (2010) (âthe Dodd-Frank Actâ) amended the Commodity
Exchange Act to add, among other things, new authority over certain leveraged, margined, or
financed retail commodity transactions, including authority to prohibit fraud in connection with
such transactions.

Section 742(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act added Section 2(c)(2)(D), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(c)(2\(D)
(2012) to the Act.â Section 2(c)(2)(D) broadly applies to any agreement, contract, or transaction
in any commodity that is entered into with, or offered to (even if not entered into with), a non-
eligible contract participant (ânon-ECPâ)â or non-eligible commercial entity on a leveraged or
margined basis, or financed by the offeror, the counterparty, or a person acting in concert with
the offeror or counterparty on a similar basis. 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(c)(2)(D)QG). Section 2(c)(2)(D)
further provides that such an agreement, contract, or transaction shall be subject to Sections 4(a),
4(b), and 4b of the Act âas if the agreement, contract, or transaction was a contract of sale of a
commodity for future delivery.â 7 U.S.C, Â§ 2(c)(2)(D)Git).

Section 2(c)(2)(D)(i1) of the Act excepts certain transactions from Section 2(c)(2)(D).
Section 2(c)(2)(D)(i)(I1)(aa) excepts a contract of sale that âresults in actual delivery within 28
days or such other longer period as the Commission may determine by rule or regulation based
upon the typical commercial practice in cash or spot markets for the commodity involved,""
Section 2(c)(2)(D)(ii)(I11)(bb) excepts a contract of sale that creates an enforceable obligation to

 

* Section 2(c)(2)(D) of the Act became effective July 16, 2011.

* As is relevant to this matter, Section 1a(18)(xi) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1a(18)(xi) (2012), defines
an eligible contract participant as an individual who has amounts invested on a discretionary
basis, the aggregate of which is in excess of $10,000,000, or which is in excess of $5,000,000
and who enters into the agreement, contract, or transaction in order to manage the risk associated
with an asset owned or liability incurred, or reasonably likely to be owned or incurred, by the
individual.

* The Commission has not adopted any regulations permitting a longer actual delivery period for
any commodity pursuant to Section 2(c)(2)(D)ii)1)(aa) of the Act. Accordingly, the 28 day
actual delivery period set forth in this provision remains applicable to all commodities.

deliver between a seller and a buyer that have the ability to deliver and accept delivery,
respectively, in connection with the line of business of the seller and buyer.

The Commission has stated that it is the view of the Commission that the determination
of whether âactual deliveryâ has occurred within the meaning of Section 2(c)(2)(D)Gi)(IID (aa)
requires a consideration of evidence beyond the four corners of the contract documents. This
interpretation of the statutory language is based on Congressâ use of the word âactualâ to modify
âdeliveryâ and on the legislative history of Section 2(c)(2)(D)(Gi)()(aa). Consistent with this
interpretation, in determining whether actual delivery has occurred within 28 days, the
Commission will employ a functional approach and examine how the agreement, contract, or
transaction is marketed, managed, and performed, instead of relying solely on language used by
the parties in the agreement, contract, or transaction.â Unless the Commission provides
otherwise, the 28 days for actual delivery is 28 days from the date the agreement, contract, or
transaction is confirmed to the buyer or seller, typically, a retail customer.

Other than these exceptions, Congress did not express any intent to limit the reach of
Section 2(c)(2)(D). Rather, in enacting the statute Congress expressed its intent that Section
2(c)(2)(D) should be applicable to a broad range of agreements, contracts, and transactions.

Section 2(c)(2)(D) of the Act applies to all agreements, contracts, and transactions
entered into with, or offered to, non-ECPs on a leveraged or margined basis, or financed by the
offeror, the counterparty, or a person acting in concert with the offeror or counterparty on a
similar basis, as those terms are commonly used in the industry.

B. The Commissionâs Jurisdiction

Respondents offered precious metals transactions to, and entered into such transactions
with, persons who were not eligible contract participants or eligible commercial entities.
Generally, Respondentsâ customers were unsophisticated, individual investors who did not meet
the $10 million discretionary investment threshold to be considered ECPs. Moreover,
Respondents offered and entered into such transactions on a margined or leveraged basis, or
financed by Double Eagle, Hunter Wise or AML, which acted in concert with Respondents.
Respondentsâ retail financed precious metals transactions fall squarely within the Commissionâs
jurisdiction under Section 2(c)(2)(D) of the Act.

Respondentsâ retail-financed precious metals transactions executed through Hunter Wise
and AML did not result in actual delivery to the customer. As found by the district court in
Hunter Wise, Hunter Wise had no actual metal to deliver. Hunter Wise, Case No. 9:12-cv-
81311-DMM, slip op. at 12-14 (S.D. Fla. Feb. 19, 2014) (order granting summary judgment).
Respondentsâ transactions are not excepted from the Commissionâs jurisdiction under Section
2(c)(2)(D)Gi)CID(A) of the Act.

(Dec. 14, 2011). :

 
C, Respondents Violated Section 4(a) of the Act: Illegal, Off-Exchange Transactions

As stated above, retail commodity transactions within the scope of Section 2(c)(2)(D) of
the Act are subject to enforcement under Section 4(a) of the Act, among other provisions, as if
such transactions are commodity futures contracts. Section 4(a) of the Act makes it unlawful for
any person to offer to enter into, enter into, execute, confirm the execution of, or conduct an
office or business in the United States for the purpose of soliciting, or accepting any order for, or
otherwise dealing in any transaction in, or in connection with, a commodity futures contract,
unless such transaction is made on or subject to the rules of a board of trade that has been
designated or registered by the CFTC as a contract market or derivatives transaction execution
facility for the specific commodity.

Respondents offered to enter into, entered into, and confirmed the execution of retail
financed precious metals transactions. Respondents also conducted an office and business in the
United States for the purpose of soliciting, accepting orders for, and otherwise dealing in retail
financed precious metals transactions. None of the retail financed precious metals transactions
were conducted on or subject to the rules of a board of trade that has been designated or
registered by the CFTC as a contract market or derivatives transaction execution facility for
precious metals. Respondents therefore violated Section 4(a) of the Act.

D. Respondents Violated Section 4d(a)(1) of the Act

Section 4d(a)(1) of the Act makes it unlawful for any person to engage as a futures
commission merchant (âFCMâ), unless such person is registered with the Commission as an
FCM and such registration has not expired or been suspended or revoked. The Act defines FCM
to include, among other things, a corporation that is engaged in soliciting or accepting orders for
any agreement, contract, or transaction described in Section 2(c)(2)(D)(i) (retail commodity
transactions) and in or in connection with such acceptance of such orders, accepts money,
securities, or property (or extends credit in lieu thereof) to margin, guarantee, or secure any
trades or contracts that result or may result therefrom. 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1a(28)(A)G)(1)(aa)(DD) and
(II). Double Eagle acted as an FCM by soliciting and accepting customersâ orders for financed
precious metals transactions and, in connection with those transactions, accepting at least $1
million from those customers, including customers who were not ECPs, As such, Double Eagle
acted as an unregistered FCM. This conduct violated Section 4d(a)(1) of the Act.

E. Double Eagle is Liable for the Violations of Arlt

Double Eagle is liable for the violations of its agent, Arlt. Under Section 2(a)(1)(B) of
the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(a)(1)(B) (2012), as well as Regulation 1.2, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.2 (2014), a
principal is strictly liable for the violations of its agents made within the scope of the agentsâ
employment. Rosenthal & Co. v, CFTC, 802 F.2d 963, 966 (7th Cir, 1986). Arlt, along with
other Double Eagle telemarketers, was an agent of Double Eagle, and in the scope of his
employment they violated Section 4(a) of the Act. Double Eagle is therefore liable for these
violations,

 
F, Arlt is Liable as the Controlling Person Under Section 13(b) of the Act for Double
Eagleâs Violations

Arlt is directly liable for violations of Section 4(a) of the Act. In addition, Arlt directly
controlled Double Eagle and directly and knowingly induced Double Eagleâs conduct
constituting violations of the Act; therefore, pursuant to Section 13(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§
13Â¢(b) (2012), Arlt is liable for Double Eagleâs violations of Section 4(a) of the Act. Section
13(b) of the Act states that a controlling person of an entity is liable for the violations of that
entity, provided that the controlling person knowingly induced, directly or indirectly, the
violations, or provided that the controlling person did not act in good faith. âA fundamental
purpose of Section 13b [sic] is to allow the Commission to reach behind the corporate entity to
the controlling individuals of the corporation and to impose liability for violations of the Act
directly on such individuals as well as the corporation itself.â CFTC v. R.J Fitzgerald & Co.,
Jnc., 310 F.3d 1321, 1334 (11th Cir. 2002) Gnternal quotation marks and citation omitted), cert.
denied, 543 U.S. 1034 (2004).

To establish controlling person liability under Section 13(b), the Division must show both
(1) control; and (2) lack of good faith or knowing inducement of the acts constituting the
violation. In re First Natâl Trading Corp., {1992-1994 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep.
(CCH) { 26,142 at 41,787 (CFTC Jul. 20, 1994), aff'd without opinion sub nom. Pick vy. CFTC,
99 F.3d 1139 (6th Cir. 1996). To establish the first element, control, a defendant must possess
general control over the operation of the entity principally liable, See, ag, RU Fitzgerald, 310
F.3d at 1334 (recognizing an individual who âexercised the ultimate choice-making power
within the firm regarding its business decisionsâ as a controlling person), Evidence that a
defendant is an officer, founder, principal, or the authorized signatory on the companyâs bank
accounts indicates the power to control a company, Jn re Spiegel, [1987-1990 Transfer Binder]
Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) 4 24,103 at 34,767 (CFTC Jan. 12, 1988). The Division must also
show that a defendant possessed specific control, which is âthe power or ability to control the
specific transaction or activity upon which the primary violation was predicated.â Monieson v
CFTC, 996 F.2d 852, 860 (7th Cir. 1993) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The
defendant does not need to participate in or benefit from the wrongdoing; the issue is whether the
defendant has the power to address the illegal conduct. /d. (finding that, in a trade allocation
case, the fact that the defendant could fire or discipline responsible employees, end the
placement of orders without numbers as soon as the defendant knew of it, or order a full
investigation was sufficient to show specific control).

With respect to control, Arlt was the owner and operator of Double Eagle. Arlt managed
the day to day operations, supervising the solicitation of retail customers and engaging in the
solicitations themselves, Arlt was the ultimate decision maker and controlled all aspects of
Double Eagleâs business. Arlt had both general control over Double Eagle and specific control
over the conduct underlying Double Eagleâs violations, i.e., Double Eagle offering to enter into,
entering into, and confirming the execution of retail financed precious metals transactions, and
Double Eagle conducting an office and business in the United States for soliciting, accepting,
and otherwise dealing in retail financed precious metals transactions.

In addition to control, the Division must show the controlling person knowingly induced,
directly or indirectly, the acts constituting the violation or did not act in good faith. To show

7

 
knowing inducement, the Division must show that a defendant had actual or constructive
knowledge of the core activities that constituted the violation and allowed the activities to
continue. /n re Spiegel, [1987-1990 Transfer Binder] Comm, Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) at 34,767. To
show lack of good faith, the Division must show that a defendant did not have an adequate
system of internal supervision, or that a defendant did not enforce such system with reasonable
diligence. Monieson, 996 F.2d at 860.

Arlt had actual knowledge that Double Eagleâs business was in off-exchange, retail
financed precious metals transactions, because it was the basic nature or essence of the business.
He also was aware that Double Eagle was not properly registered and allowed the business to
continue. Thus, Arlt knowingly induced the conduct in violation of Sections 4(a) and 4d(a)(1) of
the Act.

CFTC Orders Double Eagle Enterprises, LLC and Eric Arlt to Pay More than $700,000 in
Restitution and a Civil Monetary Penalty in Precious Metals Enforcement Action

Order also Permanently Bars Respondents from Trading on CFTC-
Regulated Markets

Washington, DC â The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today issued an Order filing and settling
charges against Double Eagle Enterprises, LLC, Double Eagle Metals (collectively Double Eagle), and its owner Eric
Arlt, all of Charlevoix, Michigan (together Respondents). The Order charged the Respondents with illegally offering off-
exchange financed transactions in precious metals with retail customers, and failure to register as a Futures Commission
Merchant (FCM) with the CFTC, as required.

The CFTC Order requires the Respondents jointly to pay restitution of $611,154 to their customers and a $100,000 civil
monetary penalty. The Order also requires the Respondents to cease and desist from further violations of the Commodity
Exchange Act, as charged, and prohibits them from trading on or pursuant to the rules of any registered entity.

The Illegal Transactions

Specifically, the CFTC Order finds that, from July 2011 through May 2013, the Respondents solicited retail customers,
generally by telephone, to buy and sell physical precious metals, such as gold and silver, in off-exchange, leveraged
transactions and failing to properly be registered. According to the Order, customers paid a percentage of the purchase
price for the metals, and Respondents purportedly financed the remainder of the purchase price, while charging
customers interest on the amount borrowed.

The CFTC Order states that financed, off-exchange transactions with retail customers have been illegal since July 16,
2011, when certain amendments of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 became effective.
As explained in the Order, financed transactions in commodities with retail customers like those engaged in by
Respondents must be executed on, or subject to, the rules of a board of trade that has been approved by the CFTC. Since
Respondentsâ transactions were done off-exchange, with customers who were not eligible contract participants, they
were illegal, the Order finds.

Failure to Register

The Order also states that it unlawful for any person to engage as a FCM, unless such person is registered with the CFTC
as an FCM and such registration has not expired or been suspended or revoked. Double Eagle acted as an FCM by
soliciting and accepting customersâ orders for financed precious metals transactions and, in connection with those
transactions, accepting at least $1 million from those customers, including customers who were not eligible contract
participants. As such, Double Eagle acted as an unregistered FCM.

The CFTC cautions victims that restitution orders may not result in the recovery of money lost because the wrongdoers
may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers and to
ensure the wrongdoers are held accountable.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this matter are Michelle Bougas, James H. Holl, Ill, and Rick
Glaser.

CFTCâs Precious Metals Fraud Advisory

In January 2012, the CFTC issued a the Precious Metals Consumer Fraud Advisory regarding precious metals fraud, saying
that it had seen an increase in the number of companies offering customers the opportunity to buy or invest in precious
metals. The CFTCâs Precious Metals Fraud Advisory specifically warns that frequently companies do not purchase any
physical metals for the customer, instead simply keeping the customerâs funds. The Advisory further cautions consumers
that leveraged commodity transactions are unlawful unless executed on a regulated exchange.

In addition, the CFTC has issued several other customer protection Fraud Advisories that provide the warning signs of
fraud. Customers can report suspicious activities or information, such as possible violations of commodity trading laws, to
the CFTC Division of Enforcement via a Toll-Free Hotline 866-FON-CFTC (866-366-2382) or file a tip or complaint online.

Respondents.

 

ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTIONS 6(c) AND 6(d) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, MAKING
FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

I,

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ) has reason to believe that
Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC, and Barclays Capital Inc. (collectively, âRespondents,â
âBarclays,â or the âBankââ) have violated the Commodity Exchange Act (the âActâ or âCEAâ)
and Commission Regulations (âRegulationsâ). Therefore, the Commission deems it appropriate
and in the public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted to
determine whether Respondents engaged in the violations set forth herein, and to determine
whether any order shall be issued imposing remedial sanctions,

Il.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Respondents have
submitted an Offer of Settlement (âOfferâ), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Without admitting or denying the findings or conclusions herein, Respondents consent to the
entry and acknowledge service of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 6(c)
and 6(d) of the Commodity Exchange Act, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions
(âOrderââ),

 

Respondents consent to the entry of this Order and to the use of these findings in this proceeding and in any other
proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party; provided, however, that Respondents
do not consent to the use of the Offer, or the findings or conclusions in this Order, as the sole basis for any other
proceeding brought by the Commission, other than in a proceeding in bankruptcy or to enforce the terms of this
Order. Nor do Respondents consent to the use of the Offer or this Order, or the findings in this Order consented to
in the Offer, by any other party in any other proceeding.

 
II.

The Commission finds the following:

A. Summary

Beginning at least as early as January 2007 and continuing through June 2012 (the
âRelevant Periodâ), Barclays, by and through certain of its traders in New York, at times
attempted to manipulate the U.S. Dollar International Swaps and Derivatives Association Fix
(âUSD ISDAFIXâ or the âbenchmarkâ), a leading global benchmark referenced in a range of
interest rate products, to benefit the Bankâs derivatives positions.

ISDAFIX rates and spreads are published daily and are meant to indicate the prevailing
mid-market rate, at a specific time of day, for the fixed leg of a standard fixed-for-floating
interest rate swap.â They are issued in several currencies. USD ISDAFIX rates and spreads are
published for various maturities of U.S. Dollar-denominated swaps, including 1-year to 10-years,
15-years, 20-years, and 30-years. The most widely used USD ISDAFIX rates and spreads, and
the ones at issue in this Order, are those that are intended to indicate the prevailing market rate as
of 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time, The 11:00 am, USD ISDAFIX rate is used for cash settlement of
options on interest rate swaps, or swaptions, and as a valuation tool for certain other interest rate
products, For example, USD ISDAFIX was used during the Relevant Period in settlement of
interest rate swap futures contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (âCMEâ) and as
a component in the calculation of various proprietary interest rate indices and structured
products.

During the Relevant Period, USD ISDAFIX was set each day in a process that began at
11:00 a.m, Eastern Time with the capture and recording of swap rates and spreads from a U.S.-
based unit of a leading interest rate swaps broking firm (âSwaps Brokerâ), Swaps Broker
disseminated rates and spreads captured in this âsnapshotâ or âprintâ â as it was referred to by
traders and brokers â as references to a panel of banks, The banks then made submissions to
Swaps Broker, Each bankâs submission was supposed to reflect the midpoint of where that
dealer would itself offer and bid a swap to a dealer of good credit as of 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time.
Most banks on the panel, including Barclays, usually submitted Swaps Brokerâs reference rates
and spreads as captured in the snapshot. As a result, after an averaging of the submissions, the
reference rates and spreads became the published USD ISDAFIX almost every day,

A Barclays interest rate options trader (âOptions Trader 1â) once referred in an email to
the risk that âsometimes isdafix is manipulated,â and in fact, Barclays, through Options Trader 1
and others at the Bank, on many occasions during the Relevant Period attempted to manipulate
USD ISDAFIX rates through its trading at the 11:00 a.m. fixing and by making submissions to
Swaps Broker that were skewed to benefit derivatives positions held by Barclays. Barclaysâ
unlawful conduct involved multiple traders, including certain desk heads during the Relevant
Period.

 

* In 2014, the administration of ISDAFIX changed, and a new version of the benchmark is published under a
different name by a new administrator using a different methodology.

2

 
First, certain Barclays traders bid, offered, and executed transactions in targeted interest
rate products, including swap spreads, at the critical 11:00 a.m. fixing time with the intent to
affect the reference rates and spreads captured by Swaps Broker in the âprintâ sent to submitting
banks, and thereby to affect the published USD ISDAFTX. As captured in emails and audio
recordings, when Barclays had derivatives positions settling or pricing against USD ISDAFIX,
traders discussed with one another and with Swaps Broker employees their intent to move USD
ISDAFIX in whichever direction benefitted their positions. Traders and brokers described the
notional amounts traders were willing to spend to influence USD ISDAFIX as âammoâ or as
amounts the traders could âburn,â âwaste,â or âuseâ to âget the printâ or âaffectâ the âfix?

Second, certain traders at Barclays attempted to manipulate USD ISDAFIX by making
false submissions for Barclays as a panel bank to Swaps Broker, skewing the rates and spreads
submitted in the direction that could have moved the USD ISDAFIX setting to benefit the
Bankâs trading positions. A bankâs derivatives trading positions or profitability are not
legitimate or permissible factors on which to base submissions in connection with a benchmark,
Yet on many occasions in 2007 and 2008 and on occasion later in the Relevant Period, Barclays
traders made USD ISDAFIX submissions higher or lower for the purpose of benefitting swaption
or swaps positions priced or valued against the benchmark, These submissions were false,
misleading, or knowingly inaccurate because they did not report where Barclays would itself bid
or offer interest rate swaps to a dealer of good credit absent a desire to manipulate USD
ISDAFIX, but rather reflected prices that were more favorable to the Bank on specific positions.
At times, Barclays made such submissions in conjunction with its illegitimate attempts to
manipulate the benchmark through trading to increase the likelihood that USD ISDAFIX rates
would move in a beneficial direction.

In accepting Respondentsâ Offer, the Commission recognizes Barclaysâ significant
cooperation during the investigation of this matter by the CFTCâs Division of Enforcement
(âDivisionâ), which included promptly reporting on significant evidence and providing important
information and analysis to the Division that helped the Division undertake its investigation
efficiently and effectively, The Commission also recognizes that Barclays commenced
significant remedial action to strengthen the internal controls and policies relating to all
benchmarks, including ISDAFIX, prior to the Divisionâs investigation.

The Commission also notes that the civil monetary penalty imposed on Barclays reflects
Barclaysâ early resolution of this matter.

C. Facts
1. USD ISDAFIX Setting

ISDAFIX rates and spreads are benchmarks that indicate prevailing market rates for
ânlain-vanillaâ interest rate swaps.â The 11:00 am. USD ISDAFIX was set during the Relevant
Period using a combination of swap spread trade data from Swaps Broker,â electronic trading in
U.S. Treasuries and Eurodollars, and submissions from a panel of swap dealer banks, including
Barclays.

Swaps Brokerâs medium-term USD swaps desk (âMTS Deskââ) functioned much like a
traditional futures trading pit. Brokers on the desk sat (or stood) together and each serviced a
number of major swap dealer banks, to whom they were connected throughout the trading day by
direct phone lines and speaker boxes. The brokers communicated their clientsâ bids and offers
by open outcry to the entire MTS Desk and all of the brokers simultaneously. Any client could
accept a bid or offer. Once a broker confirmed that a client was âhittingâ a bid, âliftingâ an offer,
or was otherwise âdoneâ in a designated notional amount (either a minimum default amount or a
greater amount), the trade between the counterparties was executed and the counterparties
received a confirmation of the trade. Barclaysâ interest rate swaps and options traders primarily
worked with one broker on the MTS Desk (âBroker 1â), but at times other Swaps Broker
employees, including brokers from Swap Brokerâs short-term swaps desk, worked with Barclays.

 

* The term âswapâ is defined in CEA Section 1a(47). Here, a âplain-vanillaâ interest rate swap is
generally an exchange of fixed payments for floating payments, wherein one party to a swap pays a fixed
rate on a set notional amount (the party who âpays fixedâ is said to have âboughtâ the swap, or is âlongâ
the swap) and the other party pays a floating rate generally tied to three-month LIBOR (the party who
âreceives fixedâ is said to have âsoldâ the swap, or is âshortâ the swap). The âmaturityâ or âtenorâ of a
swap refers to the number of years over which counterparties exchange payments.

Â° An interest rate swap spread trade consists of a fixed-for-floating interest rate swap and an offsetting
trade in U.S. Treasuries of the same tenor, which allows a party to hedge part of the interest rate risk
associated with the fixed-for-floating swap. The difference in basis points between the U.S. Treasury
yield and the swap rate constitutes the âspreadâ quoted in a spread trade. The party who âreceives fixedâ
in a swap and sells U.S. Treasuries to hedge is âshortâ spreads or has âsoldâ spreads, while a party who
âpays fixedâ in a swap and buys Treasuries to hedge is âlongâ spreads or has âboughtâ spreads.

4

 
Swaps Broker published a live feed of transaction data for USD interest rate swap
spreads, swap rates, and U.S. Treasury yields and prices to an electronic screen, known as the
â19901 screen,â accessible through a subscription-based market news service. The 19901 screen
reflected the levels at which those products were trading through the MTS Desk (for swap
spreads and swap rates) and Swaps Brokerâs proprietary electronic bond trading platform (for
US. Treasuries). The 19901 screen is a reference used widely throughout the financial industry
by swap dealer banks, hedge funds, asset managers, businesses, and other participants in interest
rate markets. During the Relevant Period, levels displayed on the 19901 screen at precisely
11:00 a.m, were critical because they were used to set USD ISDAFIX,

To set USD ISDAFIX rates for the 2-year through 30-year maturities, Swaps Broker first
generated reference rates and spreads from the snapshot of 11:00 a.m. screen prices, reflecting
either the last traded spread or the mid-point between the most recent executable bid and offer.
Swaps Brokerâs reference rates, for all maturities except the 1-year, were the sum of the
reference spread and the 19901 screenâs U.S. Treasury yield in the corresponding maturity. To
generate the 1-year reference rate (for which there was no associated swap spread), Swaps
Broker utilized a combination of Eurodollar futures yields (based on trading on CMEâs Globex
platform) and broker âsentiment,â which was intended to reflect prevailing rates for 1-year swaps
based on trading though Swaps Brokerâs short-term swaps desk.

Minutes after the 11:00 a.m. snapshot of the 19901 was taken, Swaps Broker distributed
its reference rates and spreads to a panel of 14 or more contributing banks, which either accepted
and submitted the reference rates and spreads as their own or submitted adjusted levels. Each
bank, including Barclays, was expected to submit âthe mean of where that dealer would itself
offer and bid a swap in the relevant maturity for a notional equivalent amount of USD $50
million or whatever amount is deemed market size in that currency for that tenor to an
acknowledged dealer of good credit in the swap market.âÂ® Banks could change the prices for all
rates and spreads across all maturities in their submissions, or change any subset, including any
single rate or spread, Alternatively, a panel bank could make no submission at all. After a
quorum of contributing banks made their submissions, a calculation agent eliminated the highest
and lowest submissions (known as âtopping and tailingâ) and averaged the remaining
submissions. The submission and calculation process was generally completed in the half hour
following 11:00 a.m., after which the results were accessible to the public through a
subscription-based news service,

In practice, most panel banks accepted Swaps Brokerâs reference rates and spreads as
their default submissions. Thus after âtopping and tailing,â Swaps Brokerâs reference rates and
spreads usually became the final published USD ISDAFIX benchmarks, Barclays traders often
contacted Swaps Brokerâs MTS Desk just after 11:00 a.m. to find out where the print came out,
because they understood that it usually became the final published USD ISDAFIX rate. As one
Barclays interest rate options trader (âOptions Trader 2â) stated in an April 2007 conversation

with a broker, referring to Swaps Brokerâs âsuggestedâ rate, âI would say nine and a half times
out of ten itâs the rate thatâs published.â

2. Barclaysâ Role in USD ISDAFIX Setting

Throughout the Relevant Period, Barclays was one of the panel banks that submitted rates
and spreads for the determination of USD ISDAFIX. Barclays made its daily USD ISDAFIX
submissions through the New York Interest Rate Swaps Desk (the âNY Swaps Deskâ) housed in
Barclays Capital Inc. The NY Swaps Desk was a market-making desk that traded fixed-for-
floating interest rate swaps and a variety of other products. Barclays acted as counterparty to
clients in many interest rate swap transactions and the derivatives instruments traded by the NY
Swaps Desk were used to hedge the deskâs interest rate risk and also to generate a profit for the
desk.

Because the NY Swaps Desk had primary responsibility for the U.S. Dollar swaps
business, the NY Swaps Desk was responsible for Barclaysâ USD ISDAFIX submissions. For
much of the Relevant Period, the heads of the NY Swaps Desk delegated ISDAFIX submissions
to a junior trader on the desk. At times during the Relevant Period, the NY Swaps Desk did not
have an employee assigned to make submissions and, for periods of time, Barclays made no
submission at all.

During most of the Relevant Period, Barclays did not have specific internal controls or
procedures, written or otherwise, regarding how USD ISDAFIX submissions should be
determined or monitored. ISDAFIX submitters received no formal training on making ISDAFIX
submissions, and the Bank did not require submissions to be documented during the Relevant
Period,

3. Barclaysâ Positions with Exposure to USD ISDAFIX

Barclays traders had two primary reasons to attempt to manipulate the benchmark: one
was to maximize profit (or minimize loss) for the New York Interest Rate Options Desk (âNY
Options Deskâ) in connection with swaption cash settlements; the other was to maximize profit
(or minimize loss) for the NY Swaps Desk in connection with occasional intrabank âISDAFIX
tradesâ related to a proprietary index product developed by Barclays.

a. NY Options Desk Swaption Cash Settlements

Throughout the Relevant Period, traders on Barclaysâ NY Options Desk, at times in
coordination with the NY Swaps Desk, attempted to manipulate USD ISDAFIX in order to
benefit their derivatives positions, by increasing their payments from counterparties or
decreasing payments to counterparties in cash-settled interest rate swaptions. A so-called
âEuropean swaption,â one of the primary products traded by the NY Options Desk, is an option
to enter into a plain-vanilla fixed-for-floating interest rate swap, which must be exercised at
11:00 a.m. on a specified âexpiryâ date in the future at a pre-agreed fixed âstrikeâ rate, A
swaption can be exercised by âphysicalâ delivery of the underlying swap or by cash settlement.
A swaption that expired âin-the-moneyâ would usually physically settle and, on many days, the
NY Options Desk did not have any swaption cash-settle. Swaption cash settlements
denominated in U.S. Dollars are typically calculated based on USD ISDAFIX rates according to
a formula which measures the difference between the relevant USD ISDAFIX rate on the expiry
date and the strike rate of the swaption.

 
Attempts to move USD ISDAFIX rate in Barclaysâ favor, if successful, would hurt the
Bankâs counterparties in cash settlement, as well as any other market participants who had
positions referencing USD ISDAFIX on a given day that were directionally equivalent to
Barclaysâ counterparty in the same maturity. A small movement of the benchmark higher or
lower (e.g., one basis point or less) could result in meaningful gain for the Bank on its swaption
cash settlements. As a Barclays options trader (âOptions Trader 3â) observed, â[i]t only takes a
few hundred million [notional amount of swap spread trades] to move the spreads like a bip
[basis point] or two bips.â

b. NY Swaps Desk âISDAFTX Tradesâ

Traders on the NY Swaps Desk had their own reasons to attempt to manipulate USD
ISDAFIX rates. Specifically, from time to time during the Relevant Period, the NY Swaps Desk
entered into intrabank swap transactions priced at USD ISDAFIX levels with Barclaysâ London-
based Global Interest Rate Exotics Desk (the âLondon Exotics Deskâ). The London Exotics
Desk entered into these internal trades opposite the NY Swaps Desk in order to hedge its
exposure under client-facing trades that referenced proprietary indices developed by Barclays
called TrendStar and TrendStar+ (âTrendStar Tradesâ), On the days when the London Exotics
Desk placed these orders with the NY Swaps Desk, it requested the trade in advance of the USD
ISDAFIX setting. Some Bank traders called these âISDAFIX trades.â

On occasions when the NY Swaps Desk knew it would be receiving the USD ISDAFIX
rate from the London Exotics Desk, the NY Swaps Desk traders wanted the rate to set higher so
that they could receive a higher fixed rate on the swap from the London Exotics Desk. Likewise,
on occasions when the NY Swaps Desk knew it would be paying the USD ISDAFIX rate, traders
wanted the rate to set lower, so that they could pay a lower fixed rate on the swap.â For every
fraction of a basis point that the NY Swaps Desk could successfully move the relevant USD
ISDAFIX rate to its advantage, the TrendStar indices would move to the disadvantage of
Barclaysâ clients in their TrendStar Trades facing the London Exotics Desk.

4, Means Employed in Attempts to Manipulate USD ISDAFIX

Barclays swaps and options traders understood and employed two primary means in
attempts to manipulate USD ISDAFIX rates:

e First, Barclays traders bid, offered, and/or executed swap spread trades at and around
Swaps Brokerâs 11:00 a.m. print to affect prices on the 19901 screen and thereby
increase or decrease Swaps Brokerâs reference rates and spreads and influence the
final published USD ISDAFIX. As one Barclays swaps trader (âSwaps Trader 1â)
remarked on March 7, 2007, USD ISDAFTX was âfucking randomâ and âwhat
happens at eleven is the bloody thing moves like half a basis point up and down
because everybodyâs trying to bang the screen.â

 

7 On two occasions, there is evidence that Barclays swaps traders also attempted to manipulate on-
exchange Eurodollar futures at 11:00 a.m. to advantage the Bank in connection with early-terminating
swaps. As noted above, in the 1-year maturity, Swaps Broker used Eurodollar futures yields at 11:00 a.m.
to generate the reference rate sent to USD ISDAFIX submitting banks.

7

 
@ Second, by communicating with the Bankâs USD ISDAFIX submitters on the NY
Swaps Desk or directly with Swaps Broker, Barclays traders caused the Bank to make
higher or lower submissions intended to affect the final published benchmark. As
Swaps Trader 1 explained to another Barclays trader by instant message in March
2007: âwe can put our fixings i[n] at a certain level . . . its still an average of several
banks but we will put our level in at whatsever [sic] rate u want.âÂ®

Whichever the means employed, the goal was the same â to move USD ISDAFIX in the
direction that favored Barclays on specific trading positions at the expense of its counterparties
and clients.

a. Barclaysâ Improper Trading Conduct

Barclaysâ primary means of attempting to manipulate USD ISDAFIX was to bid, offer,
and trade swap spreads at and around Swaps Brokerâs 11:00 a.m. print, in a manner designed to
move USD ISDAFIX rates in a direction that would benefit the Bank. Barclays traders
attempted to move Swaps Brokerâs reference rates and spreads by a quarter basis point or more
with a single bid, offer, or trade of minimum market size (which varied by maturity) or with a
series of bids, offers, or trades.

Traders from the NY Swaps and Options Desks, and their brokers, regularly referred to
trades or notional amounts executed for the purpose of influencing USD ISDAFIX as âammoâ or
amounts the traders were willing to âspend,â âburn,â âwaste,â or âuseâ to âget the printâ or
âaffectâ the âfix.â On May 8, 2007, Broker 1 described typical communications with Options
Trader 2: âevery time that I, we try to get a fix, I say to him, what do you need, and how much
do you have to burn? Because itâs only how much do you have to burn is the, is the real point.â

Early in the Relevant Period, traders and brokers explicitly discussed tradersâ intent to
manipulate USD ISDAFIX. For example, in 2007, Broker 1 told Options Trader 2: âIf you want
to affect it at eleven, you tell me which way you want to affect it weâll, weâll attempt to affect it
that way. In November 2008, Swaps Trader | told Broker 1, âI want a low ISDAFIX in 2sâ and
âT donât want to burn anything.â Over time, an understanding developed between traders and
brokers and their communications became less explicit. By April 2011, Options Trader 1 needed
only to bid swap spreads in the minute before 11:00 a.m., and Broker | immediately understood
Options Trader 1âs intent, asking, âYou want the screen up? Is that the idea?â âYes,â the trader
replied.

 

* Barclays traders also discussed, and on at least a few occasions attempted, manipulation through other
means, including bidding, offering, and/or executing trades in U.S, Treasuries on Swaps Brokerâs
electronic bond trading platform (for 2-year through 30-year maturities) or Eurodollar futures on CMEâs
Globex platform (for the 1-year maturity), at and around 11:00 a.m., to increase or decrease Swaps
Brokerâs reference rates and spreads and influence the final published USD ISDAFIX. In April 2007,
Options Trader 2 explained to another trader his understanding that trading CMEâs Eurodollar futures
âstrip,â referring to the first four quarterly maturities, could influence the l-year USD ISDAFIX: âif you
wanna affect this thing you need to fucking hit the strip or lift the strip.â Options Trader 2 further
remarked in regard to other maturities that â[t]he only way I affect the screen is by trading [Swaps
Brokerâs electronic bond trading platform] and hitting or lifting spreads.â

8

 
Barclays traders were willing to âburnâ or âwasteâ trades because they expected to
benefit their cash settlements to an extent that would likely exceed, but at least cover, any trading
losses. Options Trader 2 once explained to a broker why a trader would âspendâ some trades for
the benefit of a larger cash settlement:

If ve got ten billion 1-years ... and I trade two and a half billion
and I move it a quarter [basis point] in my favor, how do you think
that works out? Iâm willing to spend a quarter of the, of the risk to
get the print for the other three quarters, okay?

To affect the USD ISDAFIX print at minimal cost, traders carefully timed their trading activity
to be the last screen-moving event before the 11:00 a.m. print. On one occasion in 2008, for
example, Options Trader 1 told Broker 1: âHey, at cleven Iâm going to try to hit the 5-year
spreads down, but I have no ammo so... if itâs a wide market, Iâm just going to try to hit it
down.â Broker | responded: âyou know what, then right at eleven Iâm just gonna, just, just
scream out, do you have like a hundred at least?â On another occasion in 2012, in connection
with an ISDAFIX trade, a desk head (âSwaps Trader 2â) made clear his desire to not âspendâ
any of his âammunitionâ: âAt 11 oâclock, I have to get low print in 10-year spreads.â He added:
âwhen I say âhit it,â right, you can spend, um, two hundred fifty [million] 10-years in
ammunition. [ really donât want to spend it... but if you can keep it at 8... . it will be perfect.â
In the seconds before 11:00 a.m., Swaps Trader 2 instructed, âdo it now,â at which time the
broker yelled out: â10s down! 10s down!â

According to one Barclays trader on the NY Swaps Desk, attempting to get USD
ISDAFIX to set higher or lower was a part of tradersâ hedging strategy.â Thus, even when
traders had the opportunity to hedge risk by trading swap spreads internally or at other brokers,
they sought to trade through Swaps Broker because only Swaps Broker trades could affect USD
ISDAFIX,. For example, on February 24, 2010, Options Trader 3 told his supervisor that he had
asked the NY Swaps Desk to execute trades through Swaps Broker at 11:00 a.m, but a swaps
trader had insisted on doing the trade internally at Barclays. As a result, Options Trader 3 said, a
desk head at the Bank later told a senior swaps trader: âinstead of trading with [the NY Swaps
Desk], we need to be able to, to push spreads in the market to get the fix where we want it.â

Barclays traders distinguished between ordinary trades and trades intended â both in
timing and in price â to attempt to manipulate USD ISDAFIX. For example, in April 2009,
Broker | asked Options Trader 1 whether he was trading to affect USD ISDAFIX or for another

 

? Barclays traders referred to trades that they made around 11:00 a.m, for risk management purposes as
hedging. When swaptions cash-settled, changes in the NY Options Deskâs risk position could potentially
require traders to execute hedging trades, depending on a variety of factors, including the risk profile of
other positions and whether the desk wanted to take on the risk resulting from a cash settlement at expiry.
Likewise, with so-called âISDAFIX trades,â when the NY Swaps Desk entered swaps facing the London
Exotics Desk at USD ISDAFIX levels, the NY Swaps Desk took on new risk, which again, depending on
a variety of factors, the desk might have reason to hedge. Irrespective of whether the NY Options Desk
and NY Swaps Desk traders had an interest in hedging, they engaged in attempted manipulation when
they placed bids and offers or executed trades around 11:00 a.m. with the improper intent to move the
USD ISDAFIX rate in Barclaysâ favor.

 
reason: âare you gonna want to affect this at all or you donât care?â Options Trader 1 replied:
âno, I donât want to affect it, I do have to hedge it though.â By contrast, in August 2008, Broker
1 asked a Barclays swaps trader (âSwaps Trader 3â) about a bid in swaps spreads: âdid you want
to affect the fix or did you just want to buy âem?â Swaps Trader 3 replied: âno, no, he wanted to
affect the fixing.â

b. Barclaysâ False, Misleading, or Knowingly Inaccurate Submissions

Barclays traders also attempted to manipulate USD ISDAFIX by causing the Bank to
make false, misleading, or knowingly inaccurate submissions to Swaps Broker concerning swap
rates and spreads. As one swaps trader explained to the USD ISDAFIX submitter in April 2007:

The options guys care where the 30-year is today, okay... So
they want it lower. , . what you are going to do, just put in all the
rates wherever... Put the 30-year rate at like five point four five
five [5.455], okay? ... They have options that expire and they
depend on these rates and they get set at a certain level,

In another example, in August 2008, an ISDAFIX submitter who was out of the office instructed
another trader to âask [Options Trader 1] if he needs anything for ISDA, then submit.â

Directions from the NY Options Desk regarding submissions were, according to one
swaps trader, loudly shouted across the desks where numerous people on the trading floor could
have heard them, At times, Barclays traders on the NY Options Desk made submissions directly
to Swaps Broker by telephone, only in those maturities to which the Bank had financial
exposure. Multiple traders engaged in this conduct during the Relevant Period. It occurred in
many instances in 2007 and 2008, and on occasion later in the Relevant Period.

5. Examples of Attempted Manipulation to Benefit the NY Options Desk
in Swaption Cash Settlements

During the Relevant Period, traders on the NY Options Desk, at times with the assistance
of the NY Swaps Desk, used various means in attempts to move USD ISDAFIX higher or lower,
in order to get more from, or pay less to, their counterparties in swaption cash settlements.
Following are additional specific examples of communications of Barclays traders relating to
their attempts to manipulate USD ISDAFIX,

e On June 25, 2007, the NY Options Desk had a cash settlement on a 5-year swaption of
$635 million notional. Barclays traders on multiple desks coordinated to employ three
methods of manipulation in an attempt to maximize the amount paid to Barclays in the
swaption cash settlement. First, at approximately 10:50 a.m., Swaps Trader 1 contacted
Broker 1 on behalf of the NY Options Desk, and instructed the broker, âdonât let âem go
down,â referring to 5-year swap spreads. As 11:00 a.m. approached, he told the broker:
âfor the eleven oâclock fix I need to lift 5s up,â âI want to keep it up,â and â[i]f it gets hit
down, you hit it right back up, donât let it go down,â Swaps Trader 1 told the broker, â1
can burn like, four, five hun-, four hundred [million notional].â After trading only $200
million of 5-year swap spreads, and withdrawing his offer seconds before 11:00 a.m., he

10

 
said to the broker: âWe got it right? We got the fix, good job.â Second, in parallel, also
in the minutes leading up to 11:00 a.m., Options Trader 1 emailed traders on Barclaysâ
U.S. Treasuries desk: âI have an exercise at 11am this morning, I will need to sell 635 5s,
but I want to push the screens down at 11, as muchas... you can, so that I can get a
better 11 am print.â Pushing the 5-year U.S. Treasuries price down would increase the
yield on those Treasuries and thereby increase the 5-year USD ISDAFIX. Lastly, another
options trader (âOptions Trader 4â) emailed the USD ISDAFIX submitter at
approximately 10:54 a.m., instructing âWe want higher 5s,â referring to the Bankâs 5-
year USD ISDAFIX submission.

On September 18, 2008, a Barclays swaps trader (âSwaps Trader 4,â then a supervisor of
multiple trading desks), told Broker 1: âOkay, at eleven oâclock, we have an option
settlement, okay, I have 200 10s of ammo... and I need to get the screen as high as
possible.â Swaps Trader 4 then instructed the broker to buy swap spreads at higher,
rather than lower levels: âdonât let him hit me down at a quarter,â he told the broker, âI
want at least a half middle,â referring to the higher USD ISDAFIX print he was seeking.
On this day, Barclays stood to receive more in cash settlements from its counterparties
the higher the 10-year USD ISDAFIX.

On May 6, 2009, at approximately 10:16 a.m., Swaps Trader 3 told Broker 1: âIâm gonna
have something to do on the ISDA fixing,â and, referring to the 10-year maturity, âas low
as possible, okay.â After engaging in trading activity consistent with Swaps Trader 3âs
expressed intent, Broker | reported at approximately 11:01 a.m. that âit worked without
having to waste anything.â Minutes later, the broker told the trader Swaps Brokerâs
reference rate in the 10-year maturity, which the trader said was âfantastic.â The broker
nevertheless told the trader that he was âshading it downâ for Barclaysâ submission,
which the trader said would be âfine.â Barclays had at least two swaptions cash-settling
on this day in which the Bank would benefit from a lower 10-year ISDAFIX.

On July 26, 2011, at approximately 10:59 a.m., Swaps Trader 3 told Broker 1 that
Options Trader | âwants to keep 10-year spreads down. So, if you can, we donât have
much ammo, like a hundred; donât let it go up to 9, hit it down.â Broker 1 replied: âI
hear you. Iâm just gonna lock âem down at 11.â On this day, Barclays stood to receive
more from its counterparties, in multiple cash settlements, with a lower 10-year USD
ISDAFIX,

6, Examples of Attempted Manipulation to Benefit
the NY Swaps Desk in âISDAFIX Tradesâ

From time to time during the Relevant Period, Barclaysâ NY Swaps Desk entered into

interest rate swaps at ISDAFIX rates with the Bankâs London Exotics Desk as its counterparty.
Traders on the NY Swaps Desk attempted to manipulate USD ISDAFIX to increase their
opportunity to profit from these âISDAFIX trades.â Following are just two examples of this
misconduct.

On September 10, 2008, at approximately 8:07 a.m., the London Exotics Desk contacted
the NY Swaps Desk with an ISDAFIX trade order. As 11:00 a.m. approached, Swaps
Trader | and Swaps Trader 4 (as noted, a supervisor of multiple trading desks) attempted
to push down the 9-year and 10-year USD ISDAFIX rates and to push up the 2-year USD
ISDAFIX rate, so that the NY Swaps Desk would pay lower rates and receive higher ones
in the ISDAFIX trade.

At approximately 10:26 a.m., Swaps Trader 1 told Broker 1: âat eleven oâclock . .. we
wanna get 9s and 10s downâ and âalso we wanna get 2s up.â He explained that he would
âgo in the short-end line with [Swaps Brokerâs âBroker 2â] and get 2s up,â and that
Swaps Trader 4 was âgonna come inâ for the 9-year and 10-year maturities, where ââwe
are gonna be the offer, yeah? Donât... donât move it up... we have some ammo.â
Consistent with this plan, Swaps Trader | then told Broker 2: âAt eleven oâclock, I want
the ISDAFIX in the 2s as high as possible. So Iâm gonna come in at like five minutes to
eleven and try and bang â move 2-years up.â âTI know [another bank] is on the offer,â he
added, âbut I have a bit of ammo.â

At approximately 10:57 a.m., Broker | told Swaps Trader 4 that 10-year swap spreads
were 61.5 bid and 61.75 offered. Swaps Trader 4 replied, âListen, Iâm going to try to hit
*em down to 61.â The broker replied, âOh, I donât think youâre going to get thereâ and
listed numerous buyers in the market. Swaps Trader 4 then instructed Broker 1 to âtry
and do as little as possible,â referring to the notional amount he was willing to spend to
lower the 10-year spread. When Broker | suggested that Swaps Trader 4 may have to
spend more, Swaps Trader 4 said that the broker could trade âup toâ $250 million and
should âjust keep them, keep them fucking locked up.â When the broker replied, âI donât
think two-fiftyâs gonna hold it, quite honestly,â the trader replied, âokay, but all we need
to do is hold it for ten seconds,â referring to the seconds before 11:00 a.m.

Just after 11:00 a.m., Swaps Trader 4 remarked to the broker, âwe got it.... Yeah, you
got it at sixty one and a quarter, at 11.â The broker replied, âOh god, I hope so, let me
come right back. Let me go find out what I sold.â Later, after the final rates were
published, Swaps Trader 6, who had observed this trading activity by his colleagues,
remarked to Broker 2 about the 2-year tenor: âYeah, you did well at the 11 oâclock fix,
man,â and it âsounded like you were actually holding the spreads up with your hands;
like, it felt like you were bench pressing them over your head.â

On August 10, 2010, in another example, the London Exotics Desk placed an order at
approximately 9:14 a.m. which gave the NY Swaps Desk incentive to push up the 10-

12

 
yeat USD ISDAFIX rate and push down the 2-year USD ISDAFTX rate. At
approximately 10:43 a.m., a Barclays swaps trader (âSwaps Trader 5â) initiated the
following conversation with Broker 1, making certain first that no one was listening on

the line:
Swaps Trader 5: Could you pick me up?
Broker 1: I got you picked up.
Swaps Trader 5: Oh, okay. No one else is on the line, right?
Broker 1: No.

Swaps Trader 5:;

Alright, uh, I care about the elevens, okay.

Broker |: Oh, great. What, okay, what do you wanna do and how
much do you have to burn?

Swaps Trader 5: Yeah, so no oneâs on the line right?

Broker 1: No, not at all.

Swaps Trader 5: Alright, um. So, Iâm gonna want, uh, 10s higher and 2s
lower, okay? So â-

Broker 1: Okay.

Swaps Trader 5: Um, just, your discretion, I care more about 10s, but would
care about both of âem. Um, and have, uh, like two
hundred [million] 10s and five hundred [million] 2-year
spreads to use, okay?

Broker 1: Okay fine, you got it.

Closer to 11:00 a.m., the broker sought confirmation that the trader did not genuinely
want to fill an order of $200 million notional: âyou prefer not to burn the two hundred or
any part of it, right?â Swaps Trader 5 agreed, âyeah.â Broker | then traded on Barclaysâ
behalf in a manner consistent with Swaps Trader 5âs instructions.

IV.
LEGAL DISCUSSION
A. Jurisdiction

As set forth below, Sections 6(c), 6(d), and 9(a)(2) of the Act have long prohibited
attempted manipulation of the prices of, or false reporting in regard to, any commodity in
interstate commerce or for future delivery on or subject to the rules of any registered entity, 7
ULS.C. Â§Â§ 9, 13b, 13(a)(2) (2006). An interest rate benchmark, such as USD ISDAFIX, is a
commodity, see Sections 1a(9) and (19) of the Act, 7 U.S.C, Â§Â§ 1a(9), (19) (2012); see also 7
U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1a(4), (13) (2006), and therefore may be subject to illegal attempted manipulation,
whatever the manipulative means may be, or false reporting.

Here, Barclaysâ attempted manipulation is also proscribed by the Act for the separate
reason that the conduct involved swaps executed or traded on a Swaps Broker desk that operated
in practice as a âtrading facilityâ under the Act, see 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1a(34) (2006) (defining trading
facility); 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 2(d)(1)(B), 2(g)(3) (2006) (limiting jurisdictional exclusions to agreements,
contracts, or transactions not executed or traded on a trading facility).

13

 
Lastly, as a result of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of
2010 (âDodd-Frank Actââ), the Commission also has authority to initiate proceedings and impose
sanctions for a broader range of manipulative conduct and false reporting, including in
connection with any swap, See Sections 6(c)(1), 6(c)(1)(A), 6(c)(3), 6(d), and 9(a)(2) of the Act,
7 USS.C. Â§Â§ 9(1), 911 (A), 9(3), 13b, 13(a)(2) (2012), and Commission Regulations 180.1 and
180.2, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 180.1, 180.2 (2014). The Relevant Period encompasses conduct that
occurred after the passage and effective date of the Dodd-Frank Act.

B. Respondents Attempted to Manipulate USD ISDAFIX

Section 9(a)(2) of the Act makes it unlawful for â[a]ny person to manipulate or attempt to
manipulate the price of any commodity in interstate commerce, or for future delivery on or
subject to the rules of any registered entity.â 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13(a)(2) (2006). With respect to
conduct on or after July 16, 2011, amended Section 9(a)(2) of the Act also makes it unlawful to
manipulate or attempt to manipulate the price of âany swap.â 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13(a)(2) (2012).

For conduct prior to August 15, 2011, Sections 6(c) and 6(d) of the Act authorize the
Commission to serve a complaint and provide for the imposition of, among other things, civil
monetary penalties and cease and desist orders if the Commission âhas reason to believe that any
person... has manipulated or attempted to manipulate the market price of any commodity, in
interstate commerce, or for future delivery on or subject to the rules of any registered entity, .. .
or otherwise is violating or has violated any of the provisions of [the] Act.â 7 U.S.C. Â§ 9 (2006);
id. Â§ 13b (2006).

For conduct occurring on or after August 15, 2011, the Commission is authorized to serve
a complaint and impose penalties and orders with regard to attempted manipulation in violation
of the broader amended provisions of Sections 6(c)(1) and 6(c)(3) and the Commission
regulations implementing those provisions. See Sections 6(c)(4)(A) and 6(d) of the Act, 7
ULS.C. Â§Â§ 9(4)(A), 13b (2012).

Sections 6(c)(1) and 6(c)(1)(A) of the Act prohibit the use or attempted use of any
manipulative device, including false reporting, in connection with any swap or contract of sale of
any commodity in interstate commerce, or for future delivery, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 9(1), 9(1)(A) (2012),
and Commission Regulation 180.1(a), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 180.1(a) (2014), makes it âunlawful...,
directly or indirectly, in connection with any swap, or contract of sale of any commodity in
interstate commerce, or contract for future delivery on or subject to the rules of any registered
entity, to...(1) [ujse... or attempt to use... any manipulative device; (2) [m]ake, or attempt
to make, any untrue or misleading statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact
necessary in order to make the statements made not untrue or misleading; (3) [e]ngage, or
attempt to engage, in any act, practice, or course of business, which operates or would operate as
a fraud or deceit upon any person; or, (4) [deliver or cause to be delivered, or attempt to deliver
or cause to be delivered, for transmission through the mails or interstate commerce, ... a false or
misleading or inaccurate report concerning .. . market information or conditions that affect or
tend to affect the price of any commodity in interstate commerce.â

Section 6(c)(3) of the Act prohibits the attempted manipulation of the price of any
commodity in interstate commerce, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 9(3) (2012), and Commission Regulation 180.2,

14

 
17 C.F.R. Â§ 180.2 (2014), makes it âunlawful .. . directly or indirectly, to... attempt to
manipulate the price of any swap, or of any commodity in interstate commerce, or for future
delivery on or subject to the rules of any registered entity.â

To prove attempted manipulation under each of these provisions, the following two
elements are required: (1) an intent to affect market price, and (2) an overt act in furtherance of
that intent. See In re Hohenberg Bros. Co, [1975-77 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep.
(CCH) Â¥ 20,271, at 21,477 (CFTC Feb. 18, 1977). To prove the intent element of attempted
manipulation, the respondent must have âacted (or failed to act) with the purpose or conscious
object of causing or effecting a price or price trend in the market that did not reflect the
legitimate forces of supply and demand.â Jn re Indiana Farm Bureau Coop. Assân, [1982-1984
Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) Â§ 21,796, at 27,283 (CFTC Dec. 17, 1982).

âTW {hile knowledge of relevant market conditions is probative of intent, it is not necessary to
prove that the accused knew to any particular degree of certainty that his actions would create an
artificial price, It is enough to present evidence from which it may reasonably be inferred that
the accused âconsciously desire[d] that result, whatever the likelihood of that result happening
from his conduct.ââ Jd (quoting United States v. U.S. Gypsum Co., 438 U.S. 442, 445 (1978)).
A profit motive may also be evidence of intent, although profit motive is not a necessary element
of an attempted manipulation. See In re DiPlacido [2007-2009 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L.
Rep. (CCH) Â§ 30,970, at 62,484 (CFTC Nov. 5, 2008) (citing Jn re Hohenberg Bros. Co., [1975-
1977 Transfer Binder] Comm, Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) at 21,478)), aff'd sub. nom. DiPlacido v.
CFTC, 364 F, Appâx 657 (2d Cir. 2009). It is also not necessary that there be an actual effect on
price. See CFTC vy. Amaranth Advisors, L.L.C., 554 F, Supp. 2d 523, 533 (S.D.N.Y. 2008).

1. Respondents Attempted to Manipulate USD ISDAFIX
Through Improper Trading Conduct

As evidenced by the communications among Barclays traders and between Barclays
traders and their brokers, as well as their actual trading conduct, Barclays traders specifically
intended to manipulate USD ISDAFTX by placing bids or offers or executing trades in the
moments leading into 11:00 a.m. designed in a manner, including timing and pricing, to increase
or decrease swap spreads at 11:00 a.m., with the intent to affect levels reported on the 19901
screen and USD ISDAFIX fixings. Moreover, the evidence reflects that the traders intended
such trading conduct to affect the fixings in order to benefit Barclaysâ trading positions against
the Bankâs counterparties,

The Barclays tradersâ bids, offers, and executed trades in the moments leading into 11:00
a.m., which were intended to affect USD ISDAFIX, as well as the tradersâ communications with
each other and with their Swaps Broker brokers to plan and execute this trading conduct,
constituted overt acts in furtherance of their intent to affect USD ISDAFIX. The Barclays
traders thereby engaged in acts of attempted manipulation in violation of Sections 6(c), 6(d), and
9(a)(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 9, 13b, 13(a)(2) (2006). Additionally, with respect to conduct
occurring on or after August 15, 2011, Barclays engaged in acts of attempted manipulation in
violation of Section 6(c)(3), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 9(3) (2012), and Regulation 180.2, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 180.2
(2014), and they used or attempted to use a manipulative device in violation of Sections 6(c)(1)
and 6(c)(1)(A), 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 9(1), 9(1)(A) (2012), and Regulation 180.1(a), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 180,1(a)
(2014),

2. Respondents Attempted to Manipulate USD ISDAFIX Through
False, Misleading, or Knowingly Inaccurate Submissions

As evidenced by communications among Barclays traders, as well as Barclaysâ USD
ISDAFTX submissions themselves, Barclays traders specifically intended to affect the rate at
which USD ISDAFIX was set by making false, misleading, or knowingly inaccurate submissions
to Swaps Broker for inclusion in the calculation of the daily rates. At times during the Relevant
Period, Barclays submitted market information, specifically rates that were supposed to reflect
the mean of where Barclays would itself offer and bid a USD denominated swap in the relevant
maturity to an acknowledged dealer of good credit, to Swaps Broker that were used as part of the
process for determining the daily USD ISDAFIX rate for the various maturities. However, rather
than submitting rates and spreads that reflected Barclaysâ honest view of the true costs of
entering into a standard USD interest-rate swap in particular maturities, Barclays at times
knowingly made submissions with the intent to move USD ISDAFIX rates higher or lower in
order to benefit Barclaysâ trading positions. Through its false, misleading, or knowingly
inaccurate submissions, Barclays attempted to manipulate USD ISDAFIX for numerous tenors,

The Barclays tradersâ oral and written requests for certain rates to be submitted which
would benefit their trading positions, and the submissions resulting from those requests,
constituted overt acts in furtherance of the tradersâ intent to affect USD ISDAFIX. By doing so,
the Barclays traders engaged in acts of attempted manipulation in violation of Sections 6(c), 6(d),
and 9(a)(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 9, 13b, 13(a)(2) (2012), Additionally, with respect to conduct
occurring on or after August 15, 2011, the Barclays traders engaged in acts of attempted
manipulation in violation of Section 6(c)(3), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 9) (2012), and Regulation 180.2, 17
C.F.R, Â§ 180.2 (2014), and they used or attempted to use a manipulative device in violation of
Sections 6(c)(1) and 6(c)(1)(A), 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 9(1), 9(1)(A) (2012), and Regulation 180.1(a), 17
C.F.R. Â§ 180.1(a) (2014),

C, Respondents Made False, Misleading, or Knowingly Inaccurate Reports
Concerning USD ISDAFIX in Violation of Section 9(a)(2) of the Act

In addition to the prohibition on attempted manipulation contained in Section 9(a)(2) of
the Act, that provision also makes it unlawful for any person âknowingly to deliver or cause to
be delivered for transmission through the mails or interstate commerce by telegraph, telephone,
wireless, or other means of communication false or misleading or knowingly inaccurate reports
concerning crop or market information or conditions that affect or tend to affect the price of any
commodity in interstate commerce.â 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13(a)(2) (2006); see also United States v.
Brooks, 681 F.3d 678 (Sth Cir. 2012); United States v. Valencia, 394 F.3d 352 (5th Cir. 2004);
CFIC vy, Johnson, 408 F. Supp. 2d 259, 267 (S.D. Tex. 2005),

From time to time during the Relevant Period, Barclays, through electronic and
telephonic transmission of information to Swaps Broker, knowingly delivered or caused to be
delivered the Bankâs USD Dollar ISDAFTX submissions through the mails or interstate
commerce. Barclaysâ submissions were also delivered through the mails or interstate commerce
through daily dissemination and publication globally, including throughout the United States, of
the official published rates for USD ISDAFIX, as determined by averaging the submissions of
Barclays and other panel banks after âtopping and tailing.â Data on submissions themselves

16

 
were also disseminated. Barclaysâ daily USD ISDAFIX submissions contained market
information concerning the mean of where Barclays would itself offer and bid a swap in the
relevant maturity to an acknowledged dealer of good credit in the swap market absent intent to
manipulate USD ISDAFIX. Such market information affected or tended to affect the prices of
commodities in interstate commerce, including the daily fixing rates for USD ISDAFIX, as well
as the on-exchange interest rate swap futures and other financial instruments which relied upon
those rates.

From time to time during the Relevant Period, Barclaysâ USD ISDAFIX submissions
constituted false, misleading, or knowingly inaccurate reports because they purported to reflect
Barclaysâ honest view of the true costs of entering into a standard fixed-for-floating interest rate
swap in particular tenors, but in fact reflected tradersâ desire to move USD ISDAFIX higher or
lower in order to benefit their positions.

By using these impermissible factors in making its USD ISDAFIX submissions and
without disclosing that it based its submissions on these impermissible factors, Barclays
conveyed false, misleading, or knowingly inaccurate information that the rates it submitted were
based on the prices at which Barclays would offer and bid swaps to an acknowledged dealer of
good credit in the swaps market absent intent to manipulate USD ISDAFIX. Moreover, Barclays
submitters knew that Barclaysâ USD ISDAFIX submissions contained false, misleading, or
knowingly inaccurate information. By such conduct, Respondents violated Section 9(a)(2) of the
Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13(a)(2) (2006).

D. Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank, and Barclays Capital Are Liable for the Acts
of their Agents

Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C, Â§ 2(a)(1)(B) (2012), and Regulation 1.2, 17
C.F.R. Â§ 1.2 (2014), provide that â[t]he act, omission, or failure of any official, agent, or other
person acting for any individual, association, partnership, corporation, or trust within the scope
of his employment or office shall be deemed the act, omission, or failure of such individual,
association, partnership, corporation, or trust.â Pursuant to Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act and
Commission Regulation 1.2, strict liability is imposed on principals for the actions of their
agents. See, e.g, Rosenthal & Co. v, CFTC, 802 F.2d 963, 966 (7th Cir. 1986); Dohmen-
Ramirez & Wellington Advisory, Inc. v. CFTC, 837 F.2d 847, 857-58 (9th Cir. 1988).

Barclays Capital Inc. is liable for the acts, omissions, and failures of any traders,
managers, and submitters who acted as its employees and/or agents in the conduct described
above. Barclays Bank and Barclays PLC, which own Barclays Capital Inc., are liable for the
acts, omissions, and failures of Barclays Capital Inc. with respect to the conduct described above.
Accordingly, as set forth above, Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank, and Barclays Capital Inc.
violated Sections 6(c), 6(d), and 9(a)(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C, Â§Â§ 9, 13b, 13(a)(2) (2006); Sections
6(c)(1), 6(c)(1)(A), 6(c)(3), 6(d), and 9(a)(2), 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 9(1), 9(1)(A), 9(3), 13b, 13(a)(2)
(2012); and Regulations 180.1(a) and 180.2, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 180.1(a), 180.2 (2014).

Respondents represent that they have already undertaken certain steps intended to
make reasonable efforts to ensure the integrity of any submission to, and trading
in connection with, certain benchmarks to which Barclays submits or submitted,
including ISDAFIX and its successor benchmark (see supra footnote 2),
including, but not limited to, the following:

I.

Enhanced controls around the ISDAFIX submission process, including but
not limited to:

Automation of the data submitted to the benchmark administrator;

. Enhanced training and supervisory oversight, including by senior

members of the submitting desk;

Implementation of record keeping of submissions and daily supervisory
review; and

. Enhancement of control framework and governance;

19

 
Mandating at least annual training for all employees on the submitting and
trading desks relevant to ISDAFTX concerning appropriate market
conduct;

Reviewing Barclaysâ business practices and systems and controls, which
included remedial efforts across the bank, Compliance and front office
levels. Among other projects that Barclays undertook:

An independent review of Barclaysâ business practices was conducted,
which, among other things, led to the introduction of a new code of
conduct which sets out the ethical and professional behaviors expected of
employees;

The provision of guidance to swaps and options traders regarding the
execution of risk management trades in relation to benchmark fixings;

With respect to its investment banking operations, significant work to
strengthen the role of Compliance. The work has included increasing
Complianceâs visibility on board and management committees, developing
a process and reporting framework to support monitoring and verification
activity undertaken by Compliance, holding standardized and structured
monthly business line meetings between Compliance and the Global Head
of the business they cover, formalizing a breach review process to ensure
consistent and effective treatment of Compliance policy breaches,
enhancing and transitioning to a centralized model for trade surveillance
and e-communications surveillance and increasing Complianceâs budget
for staff and training;

Barclays undertook work on Front Office Risks and Controls, a group that
was established in December 2012 and acts as a single coordination point
to focus Barclaysâ approach to risk and control within and across the Front
Office. Barclays also undertook the development of a new Global
Supervision policy, which was followed by a training program that all
supervisors were required to complete by the end of Q3 2012 and the
appointment of a Chief Controls Officer who is responsible for
coordinating all control elements;

Barclays has conducted, and continues to conduct, significant reviews of
risks relating to benchmarks and conflicts of interest, including:

i. A project designed to evaluate benchmark rates for which Barclays
was engaged in a subjective submission process, and as a result of
which Barclays exited 10 benchmark submissions, automated 7
benchmark submissions, and implemented additional supervisory
procedures for 13 benchmark contributions; and

20

 
ii. A forward looking project to define a control framework for
potential economic conflicts of interest between Barclays and third
parties that arise from trading activities across products,
benchmarks and client order types.

Upon consideration, the Commission has determined to accept the Offer.

CFTC Orders Barclays to Pay $115 Million Penalty for Attempted Manipulation of and False
Reporting of U.S. Dollar ISDAFIX Benchmark Swap Rates

CFIC Also Took Action Today Against Barclays for Abuses of Foreign
Exchange Benchmark Rates

Barclays Has Now Been Subject to Three CFTC Enforcement Actions for
Benchmark Rate Abuses (ISDAFIX, FX, and LIBOR) Imposing a Total of
$715 Million in Penalties and Requiring Extensive Remediation

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) issued an Order today filing and settling
charges against Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC, and Barclays Capital Inc. (collectively, Barclays or the Bank). The
Order finds that, beginning at least as early as January 2007 and continuing through June 2012 (the Relevant Period),
Barclays attempted on many occasions to manipulate and made false reports concerning the U.S. Dollar International
Swaps and Derivatives Association Fix (USD ISDAFIX), a global benchmark for interest rate products. This is the first
enforcement action addressing abuses of this benchmark.

The CFTC Order requires Barclays to pay a $115 million civil monetary penalty, cease and desist from further violations
as charged, and take specified remedial steps, including measures to detect and deter trading intended to manipulate
swap rates such as USD ISDAFIX, to ensure the integrity and reliability of the Bankâs benchmark submissions, and to
improve related internal controls.

âIt is often said in CFTC precedent that âthe methods and techniques of manipulation are limited only by the ingenuity of
man.â Here, the varied and sophisticated means employed by Barclays traders in their attempts to manipulate USD
ISDAFIX are exposed,â said Aitan Goelman, the CFTCâs Director of Enforcement. âAs the CFTC has repeatedly shown,
when banks like Barclays try to tip the scales in their favor by attempting to manipulate a benchmark on which their
customers and the markets rely, we will be relentless in investigating and taking action to restore and protect market
integrity.â

Barclays, through its traders, bid, offered, and executed interest rate swap spread transactions in a manner deliberately
designed - in timing, price, and other respects - to influence the published USD ISDAFIX to benefit the Bank in its
derivatives positions, according to the Order. In addition, Barclays, through its employees making the Bankâs USD
ISDAFIX submissions, also attempted to manipulate and made false reports concerning USD ISDAFIX by skewing the
Bankâs submissions in order to benefit the Bank at the expense of its derivatives counterparties and customers.

USD ISDAFIX

ISDAFIX rates and spreads are among the leading benchmarks for interest rate swaps and related derivatives, indicating
the prevailing, daily market rate for the fixed leg of a standard fixed-for-floating interest rate swap in various currencies.
USD ISDAFIX rates and spreads are published daily (now under a different name and methodology) for various maturities
of U.S. Dollar-denominated swaps. The USD ISDAFIX rate is used for valuing cash settlement of options on interest rate
swaps, or swaptions, and as a valuation tool for a wide range of products across financial markets. For example, during
the Relevant Period, USD ISDAFIX was used in settlement of exchange-traded interest rate swap futures contracts and as
a component in the calculation of various proprietary interest rate indices and structured products. Many parties,
including pension funds and local and state governments in the U.S., rely on such instruments based on USD ISDAFIX to
hedge against changes in interest rates.

During the Relevant Period, the USD ISDAFIX was set each day in a process that began at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time with
the recording of swap rates and spreads from a U.S.-based unit of a leading interest rate swaps broking firm, which
disseminated the rates and spreads captured in this âsnapshotâ or âprintâ - as it was referred to by traders and brokers -
to a panel of banks including Barclays. The banks then made submissions to indicate where they would each bid or offer
interest rate swaps to a dealer of good credit.

Barclaysâ Unlawful Conduct to Benefit Derivatives Positions

As the Order sets forth, a Barclays interest rate options trader once referred in an email to the risk that âsometimes
isdafix is manipulated.â In fact, as the Order finds, Barclays, through that options trader and others at the Bank, on many
occasions attempted to manipulate USD ISDAFIX through its trading at the 11:00 a.m. fixing and by skewing its
submissions.
First, Barclays traders bid, offered, and executed transactions in certain interest rate products, primarily swap spreads, at
the critical 11:00 a.m. fixing time to affect the reference rates captured in the snapshot sent to submitting banks, and
thereby to affect the published USD ISDAFIX. As captured in emails and audio recordings, when Barclays had derivatives
positions settling or pricing against USD ISDAFIX, its traders discussed their intent to move USD ISDAFIX in whichever
direction benefitted their positions. Barclays traders described the notional amounts they were willing to spend to
influence the USD ISDAFIX as âammoâ or as amounts the traders could âburn,â âwaste,â or âuseâ to âget the printâ or
âaffectâ the âfix.â

Second, Barclays traders also attempted to manipulate USD ISDAFIX by making false USD ISDAFIX submissions. As the
Order finds, Barclaysâ submissions were false, misleading, or Knowingly inaccurate because they did not report where
Barclays would itself bid and offer swaps absent a desire to manipulate the USD ISDAFIX, but rather reflected prices that
were more favorable to the Bank on specific positions.

The Order describes numerous examples of each of these strategies for attempted manipulation and false reporting by
Barclays traders during the Relevant Period.

The Order recognizes Barclaysâ significant cooperation with the CFTC during the investigation of this matter. The Order
also notes that the civil monetary penalty imposed on Barclays reflects the Bankâs early resolution of this matter.

The CFTC thanks and acknowledges the assistance of the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority and the Newark,
New Jersey Field Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTIONS 6(c)(4)(A) AND 6(d) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT,
MAKING FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

I.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ or âCFTCâ) has reason to
believe that Barclays Bank PLC (âRespondentâ or âBarclaysâ) has violated the Commodity
Exchange Act (the âActâ) and Commission Regulations (âRegulationsâ), Therefore, the
Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest that public administrative
proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted to determine whether Respondent engaged in the
violations set forth herein, and to determine whether any order shall be issued imposing remedial
sanctions.

IT.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Respondent has
submitted an Offer of Settlement (âOfferâ), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Without admitting or denying the findings or conclusions herein, except to the extent Barclays
admits those findings in any related action against Barclays by, or any agreement with, the
Department of Justice or any other governmental agency or office, Barclays consents to the entry
and acknowledges service of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 6(c)(4)(A)
and 6(d) of the Commodity Exchange Act, Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions
(âOrderâ),

 

' Respondent consents to the entry of this Order and to the use of these findings in this proceeding and in any other
proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party; provided, however, that Respondent
does not consent to the use of the Offer, or the findings or conclusions in this Order, as the sole basis for any other
proceeding brought by the Commission, other than in a proceeding in bankruptcy or to enforce the terms of this
Order. Nor does Respondent consent to the use of the Offer or this Order, or the findings or conclusions in this
Order consented to in the Offer, by any other party in any other proceeding, Neither the Offer nor the Order confers
any rights to any party other than the Commission and Barclays.

 
TI.

The Commission finds the following:

A, Summary

From 2009 through 2012 (âRelevant Periodâ), Barclays, by and through certain of its
foreign exchange (âFXâ) traders, at times, sought to benefit its own trading positions or those of
FX traders at other banks by attempting to manipulate and aiding and abetting certain traders at
other banks in their attempts to manipulate certain FX benchmark rates.

One of the primary FX benchmark rates that the FX traders attempted to manipulate was
the World Markets/Reuters Closing Spot Rates (âWM/R Ratesâ). The WM/R Rates are the most
widely referenced FX benchmark rates in the United States and globally. The WM/R Rates are
used to establish the relative values of different currencies, and reflect the rates at which one
currency is exchanged for another currency. Most of the WM/R Rates at issue here are set or
fixed based on trading activity of market participants, including Barclays and other banks, at
various times throughout the day. The most widely used WM/R Rate is set or fixed at 4 p.m.
London time (âWM/R 4 p.m. London fixâ or the â4 p.m. fix.â). Another FX benchmark rate that
a Barclays FX trader attempted to manipulate is the Russian Ruble/U.S. Dollar ââRUB/USDâ
Chicago Mercantile Exchange (âCMEâ)/EMTA, Inc.â benchmark rate (âCME/EMTA Rateâ)
that is based on indicative bids and offers submitted by banks to the CME, who calculates and
issues the CME/EMTA Rate as well as publishes the submitted bids and offers of each
participant.

FX benchmark rates, including the WM/R Rates and the CME/EMTA Rate, are used to
price a variety of transactions including foreign exchange swaps, cross currency swaps, spot
transactions, forwards, options, futures, and other financial derivative instruments. For example,
the CME/EMTA Rate is the primary rate source for settling Russian Ruble non-deliverable
forward transactions and the price used for calculation of the CME Russian Ruble futures final
settlement price at termination.""

At times during the Relevant Period, certain FX traders at Barclays and other banks
coordinated their trading or indicative rate submissions to attempt to manipulate certain FX
benchmark rates, including the WM/R 4 p.m. London fix and the CME/EMTA Rate, to their
benefit. These FX traders at Barclays and the other banks used private electronic chat rooms to
communicate and plan their attempts to manipulate the FX benchmark rates for certain currency
pairs.â Certain FX traders at Barclays regularly participated in numerous private chat rooms. At
times, in certain chat rooms, FX traders at Barclays and other banks disclosed confidential
customer order information and trading positions, altered trading positions or CME/EMTA

 

* Formerly, the âEmerging Markets Traders Association.â

* Also known as the CME/EMTA Russian Ruble per USD Reference Rate,

banksâ FX desks.

 
submissions to accommodate the interests of the collective group, and agreed on trading
strategies as part of an effort by the group to attempt to manipulate certain FX benchmark rates,
in some cases downward and in some cases upward.

Barclays tradersâ attempts to manipulate certain FX benchmark rates involved multiple
currencies, including some of the most actively traded currencies like the U.S. Dollar, Euro, and
British Pound Sterling. The wrongful conduct involved desks and offices located in at least New
York, London and Moscow.

This conduct occurred at various times over the course of the Relevant Period without
detection by Barclays in part because of internal controls and supervisory failures at Barclays.
Barclays failed to adequately assess the risks associated with its participation in the fixing of
certain FX benchmark rates, including the WM/R 4 p.m. London fix and CME/EMTA rates.
Barclays also lacked adequate internal controls or procedures to detect and deter possible
misconduct involving certain FX benchmark rates and failed to adequately supervise its FX
traders by, among other shortcomings, failing to have adequate controls and monitoring over the
use of electronic chat rooms.

In fact, some of this conduct occurred during the same period that Barclays was on notice
that the CFTC and other regulators were investigating attempts by certain banks to manipulate
the London Interbank Offered Rate (âLIBORâ) and other interest rate benchmarks.Â°

2K oR oe

In accepting Barclaysâ Offer, the Commission recognizes Respondentâs significant
cooperation during the CFTCâs Division of Enforcementâs (âDivisionâ) investigation of this
matter, which included self-reporting preliminary findings of questionable conduct by Barclays
employees to the CFTC and by providing important information and analysis to the Division that
helped the Division efficiently and effectively undertake its investigation. In addition, the
Commission acknowledges that Barclays initiated its own internal investigation into FX trading
prior to the Divisionâs investigation. The Commission also recognizes that Barclays has
commenced significant remedial action to strengthen the internal controls and policies relating to
foreign exchange benchmarks and internal and external communications by traders.

The Commission notes, however, the civil monetary penalty imposed reflects, in part,
that Barclays did not settle this matter at an earlier stage of the investigation.

OF Facts
1. The FX Market

The FX market, in which traders are able to buy, sell, exchange and speculate on
currencies, is one of the worldâs largest and most actively traded financial markets. According to
the Bank of International Settlements, trading in global foreign exchange markets averaged $5.3
trillion per day in April 2013. Currencies are traded in pairs and the transacted rate represents
the rate to exchange one currency for another currency. The U.S. Dollar is the dominant
currency in the foreign exchange market. The exchange of the U.S, Dollar for another currency
accounts for an estimated 87% of global foreign exchange market activity. The most actively
traded currency pairs are the Euro/U.S. Dollar (EUR/USD), U.S. Dollar/Japanese Yen
(USD/JPY), and British Pound Sterling/U.S. Dollar (GBP/USD). Participants in the FX market
include banks, investment firms, commercial companies, central banks, hedge funds and retail
customers.

The foreign exchange market is comprised of many instruments including spot, forwards,
swaps, futures and option contracts.

2. WM/R Rates and CME/EMTA Rate Overview

The WM/R Rates, some of the leading and most widely referenced foreign exchange
benchmark rates, are calculated multiple times daily, including at 4 p.m. London time, which is
commonly referred to as the âWM/R 4 p.m. London fixâ or the â4 p.m. fix.ââ For twenty-one of
the most liquid currencies (the âtrade currenciesâ), the 4 p.m. fix is based on actual trades, using
bids and offers extracted from a certain electronic trading system during a one-minute window
(âfix periodâ). WM/Reuters determines the bid and offer rates based on the captured transacted
rate and the bid-offer spread. WM/Reuters then calculates the median of these bid and offer
rates and from these medians determines a âmid trade rate.â If there are not enough trades,
WM/Reuters calculates a âmid order rate.â All orders and transactions are weighted equally,
regardless of their notional sizes,

The WM/R Rates for the other 139 less liquid currencies (the ânon-trade currenciesâ) are
set by similar methodology. Because these currencies are less liquid, WM/Reuters relies on
indicative quotes (submissions) derived from a Reuters computer feed that solicits âindications
of interestâ from market participants as part of its fixing methodology. WM/Reuters captures
independent snapshots of indicative quotes for bids and offers, and selects the median rate from
these quotes as the ââWM/R 4 p.m. London fix.â

 

â Another important benchmark is the European Central Bank (âECBâ) rate set by the ECB at 1:15 p.m, London
time. Though less widely referenced than the WM/R Rate, the ECB Rates are also used by a wide range of
participants, specifically non-financial corporates and are important for the non-deliverable forwards market. See
Financial Stability Board Foreign Exchange Benchmarks Final Report at 1. (September 30, 2014).

4

 
WM/Reuters also provides fix rates for forward and non-deliverable forward contracts
using methodology similar to that used for non-trade currencies. Fix rates for forward and non-
deliverable forward contracts are published using a premium or discount to the spot rate for the
relevant currency pair.

Other FX benchmark rates are priced through the use of indicative rates. The Russian
Ruble/U.S. Dollar CME/EMTA Rate is derived from a daily telephonic survey of participating
banksÂ® that the CME conducts at a random time between 12:00 p.m. and 12:30 p.m. Moscow
time. If a bank responds to the daily survey, it provides the bid and offer at which it could
execute a $100,000 RUB/USD spot transaction for next-day value in the Moscow marketplace.
Survey participantsâ responses are then confirmed in writing, recorded telephone message or
other secure electronic communication.â If more than ten survey responses are received, the
CME randomly selects ten responses. The CME then determines the midpoint of each bid-offer
pair and eliminates the two lowest and the two highest midpoints. 'Â° The mean of the remaining
six midpoints results in the CME/EMTA Rate for that day. The responding bank names and
their indicative responses are published by the CME and EMTA on their respective websites as
well as the calculated CME/EMTA Rate. The bids and offers submitted by the survey
participants should reflect their honest assessment of the current prevailing market rate. Taking
into account the benefit to the survey participantsâ trading positions is not a legitimate or
permissible factor in assessing the currently prevailing market rate.

Foreign exchange futures contracts are connected to FX benchmark rates. The CME
Russian Ruble/U.S, Dollar (RUB/USD) futures contract, for instance, is a cash settled futures
contract for which the final settlement rate, a component of the contractâs price, is equal to the
reciprocal of the CME/EMTA Rate. Exchange rates in many actively traded CME foreign
exchange futures contracts, including the Euro/U.S. Dollar EUR/USD) futures, the U.S.
Dollar/JJapanese Yen (USD/JPY) futures, and British Pound Sterling/U.S. Dollar (GBP/USD)
futures, track rates in spot foreign exchange markets at near parity after adjusting for the forward
differential, or adding or subtracting âforward points.â Speculative traders employ strategies that
seek to capture short-lived arbitrage opportunities between foreign exchange futures and spot
contracts. Since 2012, the CME provides clearing and other services for cash-settled Over the
Counter FX Spot, Forward, Swaps, and Non-Deliverable Forward (NDF) contracts, The
contracts cover 26 currency pairs, including EUR/USD, USD/JPY, and GBP/USD, and are cash-
settled based on the WM/R 4 p.m. London fix.

3. Barclays Tradersâ Attempts to Manipulate Trading Based FX Benchmark
Rates

In late 2008, as the financial crisis began to wane, liquidity and volume in the FX market
increased as many financial institutions and other market participants sought to exchange

Russian Ruble non-deliverable forward markets.

* See CME Rulebook, Chapter 260 (26002 Settlement Procedures),

'Â° If fewer than ten responses are received (but more than five) the CME eliminates the high and low midpoint. If
fewer than five responses are received no rate will be published for that day.

currencies. The increase in volume and liquidity allowed Barclays FX traders and traders at
other banks to take advantage of this trading opportunity, specifically during the FX benchmark
rate fixing periods,

At the same time, certain FX traders at Barclays and other banks had and/or developed
relationships with certain FX traders at other banks, and they increasingly used private chat
rooms to communicate and share information with each other. Certain FX traders at Barclays
and other banks routinely participated in the chat rooms. Often, these FX traders had multiple
chat rooms open simultaneously on their trading terminals, and within a chat, the traders often
focused on a particular currency pair. Being a member of certain chat rooms was sometimes
exclusive and by invitation only,

For example, when inviting in a new member, traders in one chat room tried to ensure
that a new member agreed to put the interests of the group first. In one chat, traders from three
other banks discussed'! whether to invite a Barclays trader into a chat room:

Bank Z Trader: 7:49:55 are we ok with keeping this as is..
ie the info lvls & risk sharing?
Bank X Trader: 7:50:27 well...
Bank Z Trader: 7:50:30 that is the qu/estion]
Bank X Trader: 7:50:32 you know him best obv...
7:50:39 if you think we need to adjust it
7:50:43 then he shouldnât be[] in chat
Bank Y Trader: 7:50:54 yeah that is key
7:51:00 simple question [Bank Z Trader]
7:51:08 I trust you implicitly [Bank Z Trader]
7:51:13 and your judgement
7:51:16 you know him
7:51:21 will he tell rest of desk stuff
7:51:26 or god forbin his nyk...
Bank X Trader: 7:51:46 yes
7:51:51 thatâs really imp[ortant] question]
7:52:01 dont want other numptyâs in mkt to know
7:52:17 but not only that
7:52:21 is he gonna protect us
7:52:33 like we protect each other against our own branches
7:52:46 ic if you guys are rhs.. and my nyk is lhs..ill say my
nyk ths in few
Bank Z Trader: 7:53:52 what concerns me is that i know heâll never tell us

when at risk...

After further discussion of whether the Barclays trader would âadd huge value to this cartell,â the
traders decided to invite the trader into the chat room for a â1 month trial,â with the Bank X

 

'' The communications quoted in this Order contain shorthand trader language and many typographical errors. The
shorthand and errors are explained in brackets within the quotations only when deemed necessary to assist with
understanding the discussion.

 
Trader warning him, presumably facetiously, âmess this up and sleep with one eye open at
night.â

These chat rooms were the vehicles through which certain Barclays FX traders and
traders at other banks coordinated attempts to manipulate certain FX benchmark rates, including
the WM/R 4 p.m. London fix. Certain chat room participants used code words to evade
detection by their banksâ compliance monitoring systems.

At times during the Relevant Period, in their attempts to manipulate certain benchmarks
(up or down), Barclays FX traders exchanged the size and direction of the bankâs net orders with
FX traders at other banks and used this information to attempt to coordinate trading strategies,
The traders at times then used this information to enable one or more traders to attempt to
manipulate the FX benchmark rates prior to and during the relevant fixing period.

For example, in one of the chat rooms, if a trader determined that he had fix orders in the
opposite direction to the chat room groupâs overall net fixing position approaching the fixing
window, that trader may have transacted before the fix period with traders outside the private
chat room, a practice known by market participants as ânetting off,â rather than transact with
other traders within the chat room.ââ In certain cases, the goal of this trading strategy was to
maintain the volume of orders held by chat room members in the direction favored by the
majority of the private chat room members and limit orders being executed in the opposite
direction during the fix window.

If traders in the chat room had net orders in the same direction as what they desired rate
movement at the fix to be, then the traders would at times either (1) match off these orders with
traders outside of the chat room in an attempt to reduce the volume of orders in the opposite
direction transacted during the fix period; (2) transfer their orders to a single trader within the
chat room who could then execute a single order during the fix period; or (3) transact with
traders outside of the chat room to increase the volume traded by chat room members during the
fix window in the direction favored by the private chat room traders. At times, traders also
increased the volume traded by them at the fix in the direction favored by the chat room traders
in excess of the volume necessary to manage the risk associated with their banksâ net buy or sell
orders at the fix. At times, these actions were undertaken in order to attempt to manipulate the
benchmark rate set during the fix period.

Some examples of Barclays FX tradersâ misconduct include:

In one chat, a Bank Y Trader and a Barclays trader coordinated their trading in an attempt
to manipulate a WM/R 4 p.m. London fix. At 3:43:50, the Barclays trader asked the Bank Y
trader whether he needed to buy Euros in the market in the forthcoming fix. The Bank Y trader
responded that he had a net buy order for the fix, which he subsequently confirmed as totaling
105 million. At 3:44:04, the Bank Y trader offered to transfer that net buy order to the Barclays
trader. The Barclays trader replied âmaybeâ and then stated that he had a net buy order for 150
million.

 

The Commission does not consider that the netting off of orders (or the decision not to net off) ahead of fixes is
inappropriate in all circumstances,

 
The traders had the following exchange:

Barclays Trader: 3:46:53 i'd prefer we join forces
Bank Y Trader: 3:46:56 perfick

3:46:59 lets do this...
Bank Y Trader: 3:47:11 lets double team them
Barclays Trader: 3:47:12 Y ESssssssssssss

Immediately after the fixing window, the traders congratulated themselves:

Barclays Trader: 4:03:25 sml rumour we havenât lost it
Bank Y Trader: 4:03:45 we

4:03:46 do

4:03:48 dollarrr

In another chat, traders for Barclays and three other banks exchanged positions in a chat
room leading into the WM/R 4 p.m. fix. The Bank Y trader said âit cant be a good day to be
[right hand side].â '* Once the four traders determined they were all the same direction, the
Barclays trader asked if âwe gonna be able to get it to 05â to which the Bank Y trader responded
âis that the troyal fkn we.â After the fixing window closed the Bank X trader said ânice callâ and
the chat room members gave their âscoresâ or profits from the fix, The chat room members each
claimed they made between $60,000 and $220,000.

4, Barclays Tradersâ Attempts to Manipulate the Submission Based
CME/EMTA Rate through False Reports

Barclays provided indicative bids and offers to the CME for the fixing of the
CME/EMTA Rate on certain days between August 2009 until August 2011. On at least a few
occasions, a Barclays FX trader attempted to manipulate the CME/EMTA Rate by providing
false reports concerning his view of the current prevailing bids and offers to the CME in order to
move the CME/EMTA Rate up or down in whatever direction would benefit his trading positions
or the trading positions of other banks. The Barclays FX trader coordinated, through an
electronic chat room, with traders from other banks who also made submissions to skew their
indicative bids and offers to try to move the CME/EMTA Rate in the direction they desired.

For example, in one chat including a Barclays FX trader, one RUB/USD trader suggested
âwe should all lower fix by several kopecksâ to which another trader replied âves.7/4 A third
trader agreed that âit is a right idea to lower the fix by a few kopecks,â The Barclays FX trader
responded ââso what, 5 kopecks and all/everyone is splendid.â After that conversation, the
Barclays trader submitted an artificially low indicative bid and offer to the CME, consistent with

 

'â If an FX trader has orders to sell of the first currency listed in any currency pair, it is often referred to as being on
the left-hand side, or âIhs.â Tf an FX trader references right hand side, or ârhs,â it indicates that the FX trader is a
buyer of the first currency listed in a currency pair.

'â RUB/USD chatroom language is in Russian and quotations come from an unofficial translation.

8

 
his conversation with the other traders, that was used by the CME to calculate the final
CME/EMTA Rate.

A bankâs trading positions are not legitimate or permissible factors on which to base a
bankâs submission of bids and offers for purposes of determining the CME/EMTA Rate.

5. Respondent Lacked Adequate Internal Controls

During the Relevant Period, Barclays failed to adequately assess the risks associated with
its FX traders participating in the fixing of certain FX benchmark rates. Barclays also lacked
adequate internal controls in order to prevent its FX traders from engaging in improper
communications with certain FX traders at other banks. Barclays lacked sufficient policies,
procedures and training specifically governing participation in trading around the FX
benchmarks rates and had inadequate policies pertaining to, or insufficient oversight of, its FX
tradersâ use of chat rooms or other electronic messaging.

In approximately March 2012, Barclays received a customer complaint regarding
potential inappropriate disclosure of customer information in an internal FX chatroom, Barclays
then undertook an investigation of FX chatroom usage. Following and as a result of that
investigation, in consultation with FX management and Legal and Compliance representatives,
beginning in August 2012, Barclays undertook a process of instructing FX traders to cease
participation in multi-bank chat rooms, and issued guidance and enhanced training with respect
to the sharing of client information. On October, 22, 2012, FX traders at Barclays were formally
instructed to cease participation in multi-bank chatrooms,

Furthermore, in June 2013, Barclays commenced an internal investigation of possible
misconduct by it FX Traders relating to FX benchmark rates. On October 25, 2013, Barclays

reported to the CFTC and other governmental authoritiesâ preliminary findings of questionable
conduct.

IV.

LEGAL DISCUSSION

 

A. Barclays, Through the Acts of Certain Traders, Attempted to Manipulate FX
Benchmark Rates

Together, Sections 6(c),'Â° 6(d) and 9(a)(2) of the Act prohibit acts of attempted
manipulation. 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§9, 13b and 13(a)(2) (2012). Section 9(a)(2) of the Act makes it
unlawful for â[a]ny person to... attempt to manipulate the price of any commodity in interstate
commerce, or for future delivery on or subject to the rules of any registered entity....â 7
ULS.C. Â§ 13(a)(2) (2012). Sections 6(c) and 6(d) of the Act authorize the Commission to serve a
complaint and provide for the imposition of, among other things, civil monetary penalties and
cease and desist orders if the Commission âhas reason to believe that any personâ has attempted

 

'Â® Section 6(c) was amended effective August 15, 2011. For conduct occurring on or after that date, the relevant
Section of the Act is now Section 6(c)(4)(A), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 9(4)(A) (2012).

9

 
to manipulate the market price of any commodity, in interstate commerce, or otherwise is
violating or has violated any of the provisions of the Act. 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 9 and 13b (2012).

With respect to conduct on or after August 15, 2011, in addition to Sections 6(c), 6(d)
and 9(a)(2), Section 6(c)(3) of the Act prohibits the attempted manipulation of the price of any
commodity in interstate commerce. 7 U.S.C. Â§ 9(3) (2012). Commission Regulation 180.2, 17
C.F.R. Â§180.2 (2014), which became effective on August 15, 2011, in relevant part, makes it
âunlawful to... directly or indirectly ... to attempt to manipulate, the price of ...any
commodity in interstate commerce.â Regulation 180.2 codifies Section 6(c)(3).

Two elements are required to prove an attempted manipulation: (1) an intent to affect the
market price, and (2) an overt act in furtherance of that intent. See In re Hohenberg Bros. Co.,
[1975-77 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) 7 20,271, at 21,477 (CFTC Feb. 18,
1977); CFTC v. Bradley, 408 F, Supp. 2d 1214, 1220 (N.D. Okla. 2005). To prove the intent
element of attempted manipulation, it must be shown that Barclays FX traders âacted (or failed
to act) with the purpose or conscious object of causing or effecting a price or price trend in the
market that did not reflect the legitimate forces of supply and demand.â Jn re Indiana Farm
Bureau Coop. Assân, [1982-1984 Transfer Binder] Comm, Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) Â¥ 21,796, at
27,283 (CFTC Dec. 17, 1982), â[W]hile knowledge of relevant market conditions is probative of
intent, it is not necessary to prove that the accused knew to any particular degree of certainty that
his actions would create an artificial price. It is enough to present evidence from which it may
reasonably be inferred that the accused âconsciously desire[d] that result, whatever the likelihood
of that result happening from his conduct.ââ /d. (quoting U.S. v. U.S. Gypsum Co., 438 U.S, 422,
445 (1978)). A profit motive may also be evidence of intent, although profit motive is not a
necessary element of an attempted manipulation. See In re DiPlacido, [2007-2009 Transfer
Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) 4 30,970, at 62,484 (CFTC Nov. 5, 2008) (citing Jn re
Hohenberg Bros, Co,, [1975-1977 Transfer Binder] Comm, Fut, L. Rep. (CCH) at 21,478)),
aff'd, 364 Fed. Appx. 657, No. 08-5559-ag, 2009 WL 3326624 (2d Cir, 2009), Itis also not
necessary that there be an actual effect on price. See CFTC vy, Amaranth Advisors, L.L.C., 554 F.
Supp.2d 523, 533 (S.D.N.Y. 2008).

Here, as evidenced by the communications and other facts set forth above, certain
Barclays FX traders specifically intended to affect the fixing of certain FX benchmarks,
including the WM/R Rates and CME/EMTA Rate. Their intent is also made clear by the
evidence that their motive was to benefit Barclaysâ trading positions or the trading positions of
other banks. Barclays, through its traders, took overt acts in furtherance of intent to affect the
fixings of certain FX benchmarks, including the WM/R Rates and CME/EMTA Rate,
Accordingly, Barclays engaged in acts of attempted manipulation of certain FX benchmarks,
commodities in interstate commerce, in violation of Sections 6(c), 6(d) and 9(a)(2), 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§
9, 13b and 13(a)(2) (2012). Additionally, with respect to conduct occurring on or after August
15, 2011, Barclays engaged in acts of attempted manipulation in violation of Section 6(c)(3), 7
U.S.C. Â§ 933) (2012), and Regulation 180.2, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 180.2 (2014).

B. Barclays Made False, Misleading or Knowingly Inaccurate Reports to the CME
Relating to the Russian Ruble/ U.S. Dollar CME/EMTA Rate

Section 9(a)(2) of the Act makes it unlawful for any person âknowingly to deliver or
cause to be delivered for transmission through the mails or interstate commerce by telegraph,
telephone, wireless, or other means of communication false or misleading or knowingly
inaccurate reports concerning crop or market information or conditions that affect or tend to
affect the price of any commodity in interstate commerce...â 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13(a)(2) (2006);
United States v. Brooks, 681 F.3d 678, 691 (Sth Cir. 2012); United States v. Valencia, 394 F.3d
352, 354-55 (Sth Cir, 2004); see also CFTC vy. Johnson, 408 F. Supp. 2d 259, 267 (S.D. Tex.
2005).

In limited instances between August 2009 until August 2011, Barclays, acting through
one of its traders, knowingly provided or caused to be provided to the CME false, misleading or
knowingly inaccurate reports concerning the bids and offers at which it could execute a $100,000
RUB/USD spot transaction for next-day value in the Moscow marketplace for purposes of the
CME/EMTA Rate calculation. The Barclays traderâs reports were also caused to be delivered
through the mails or interstate commerce through the daily dissemination and publication
globally, including in the United States, of the results of the survey via the Reuters, CME and
EMTA websites. The CME also distributes the CME/EMTA Rate through its normal
distribution channels. Barclaysâs CME/EMTA submissions contained market information
concerning the prevailing market rates at which a $100,000 RUB/USD spot transaction for next-
day value in the Moscow marketplace could be executed. Such market information affects or
tends to affect the prices of commodities in interstate commerce, including the rate at which the
CME/EMTA Rate is fixed.

During the relevant period, on certain occasions, Barclaysâ CME/EMTA Rate survey
responses were false, misleading or inaccurate because the bids and offers it submitted were
skewed to benefit trading positions held by the Barclaysâ trader or traders at other banks, and
thus based on illegitimate factors. The Barclays trader knowingly submitted the false bids and
offers. By submitting false bids or offers in its survey responses, Barclays conveyed false,
misleading or inaccurate market information that the bids and offers it submitted were based on
and related solely to its reasonable judgment and honest assessment of the bids and offers at
which it could execute a $100,000 RUB/USD spot transaction for next-day value in the Moscow
marketplace and were truthful and reliable.

By such conduct, Barclays violated Section 9(a)(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C, Â§ 13(a)(2)
(2006),

Cc, Respondent Aided and Abetted the Attempts of Certain Traders at Other Banks to
Manipulate FX Benchmark Rates

Pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Act, liability as an aider and abettor requires proof that:
(1) the Act was violated, (2) the aider and abettor had knowledge of the wrongdoing underlying
the violation, and (3) the aider and abettor intentionally assisted the primary wrongdoer. See 7
ULS.C. Â§ 13c(a) (2012); In re Sharokh Nikkhah, {1999-2000 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut, L.

1]

 
Rep. (CCH) Â¥ 28,129, at 49,888 n.28 (CFTC May 12, 2000). Although actual knowledge of the
primary wrongdoerâs conduct is required, knowledge of the unlawfulness of such conduct is not
necessarily required to be demonstrated. See In re Lincolnwood Commodities, Inc., [1982-1984
Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) Â§ 21,986, at 28,255 (CFTC Jan. 31, 1984).
Knowing assistance can be inferred from the surrounding facts and circumstances. Jd. See also
In re Buckwalter, [1990-1992 Transfer Binder] Comm, Fut, L. Rep. (CCH) Â§ 24,995, at 37,686
(CFTC Jan, 25, 1991),

Here, as evidenced by the foregoing acts of coordination to benefit respective trading
positions, FX traders at other banks attempted to manipulate the WM/R, CME/EMTA and other
FX benchmark rates in violation of Sections 6(c), 6(d) and 9(a)(2), 7 U.S.C, Â§Â§ 9, 13b and
13(a)(2) (2012), Additionally, with respect to conduct occurring on or after August 15, 2011 FX
traders at other banks violated Section 6(c)(3), 7 U.S.C, Â§ 9(3), and Regulation 180.2, 17 C.F.R.
Â§ 180.2 (2014). As evidenced above, Barclays, through the acts of certain of its FX traders, aided
and abetted the attempts of traders at other banks to manipulate the FX benchmark rates in
violation of the Act.

D. Barclays is Liable for the Acts of its Agents

Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(a)(1)(B) (2012), and Regulation 1.2, 17
C.F.R. Â§ 1.2 (2014), provide that â[t]he act, omission, or failure of any official, agent or other
person acting for any individual, association, partnership, corporation, or trust within the scope
of his employment or office shall be deemed the act, omission, or failure of such individual,
association, partnership, corporation or trust[.]â Pursuant to Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act and
Commission Regulation 1.2, strict liability is imposed on principals for the actions of its agents,
See, e.g., Rosenthal & Co. y. CFTC, 802 F.2d 963, 966 (7th Cir. 1986); Dohmen-Ramirez &
Wellington Advisory, Inc. v. CFTC, 837 F.2d 847, 857-58 (9th Cir, 1988),

Barclays is liable for the acts, omissions and failures of any traders who acted as its
employees and/or agents in relation to the conduct described above. Accordingly, Barclays
violated Sections 6(c), 6(d) and 9(a)(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 9, 13b and 13(a)(2)(2012), by
engaging in attempted manipulation and aiding and abetting attempted manipulation,
Additionally, with respect to conduct occurring on or after August 15, 2011, Barclays is liable
for violating Section 6(c)(3), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 9(3), 13(a)(2) (2012), and Regulation 180.2, 17 C.F.R. Â§
180.2 (2014), as set forth above.

V.
FINDINGS OF VIOLATIONS
Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that Respondent violated Sections 6(c),
6(d) and 9(a)(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 9, 13b and 13(a)(2) (2012), and for conduct occurring on

or after August 15, 2011, Section 6(c)(3), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 9(3) and Regulation 180.2, 17 C.F.R.

Barclays to Pay $400 Million Penalty to Settle CFTC Charges of Attempted Manipulation
and False Reporting of Foreign Exchange Benchmark Rates

CFTC Also Took Action Today Against Barclays and its Affiliates for
Attempted Manipulation and False Reporting of the ISDAFIX
Benchmark, an Interest Rate Benchmark â the First Enforcement
Action Addressing Abuse of ISDAFIX

Barclays Has Now Been Subject to Three CFTC Enforcement Actions for
Benchmark Rate Abuses (ISDAFIX, FX, and LIBOR) Imposing a Total of
$715 Million in Penalties and Requiring Extensive Remediation

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today issued an Order filing and settling
charges against Barclays Bank PLC (Barclays) for attempted manipulation, false reporting, and aiding and abetting
other banksâ attempts to manipulate, global foreign exchange (FX) benchmark rates to benefit the positions of certain
traders.

This Order requires Barclays to pay a civil monetary penalty of $400 million, cease and desist from further violations, and
take specified steps to implement and strengthen its internal controls and procedures, including the supervision of its FX
traders, to ensure the integrity of its participation in the fixing of foreign exchange benchmark rates and internal and
external communications by traders. The Order notes that the $400 million civil monetary penalty reflects in part that
Barclays did not settle at an earlier stage of the investigation.

On November 11, 2014, the CFTC imposed $1.475 billion in civil monetary penalties against five banks for similar
misconduct (see CFTC Press Release 7056-14): /n re Citibank, N.A., CFTC Docket No. 15-03) ($310 Million penalty); /n re
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., CFTC Docket No. 15-04) ($310 Million penalty); /n re The Royal Bank of Scotland plc, CFTC
Docket No. 15-05) ($290 Million penalty); /n re UBS AG, CFTC Docket No. 15-06) ($290 Million penalty); /n re HSBC Bank
plc, CFTC Docket No. 15-07) ($275 Million penalty).

Aitan Goelman, the CFTCâs Director of Enforcement, stated: âEnsuring the integrity of our markets and the publicâs faith
in that integrity is a core mission of the CFTC. There is very little that is more damaging to the publicâs faith in the
integrity of our markets than a cabal of international banks working together to manipulate a widely-used benchmark in
furtherance of their own narrow interests. The CFTC will continue to bring these cases until the public can be confident in
the integrity of benchmark rates.â

According to the Order, one of the primary benchmarks that Barclays FX traders attempted to manipulate was the World
Markets/Reuters Closing Spot Rates (WM/R Rates). The WM/R Rates, the most widely referenced FX benchmark rates in
the United States and globally, are used to establish the relative values of different currencies, which reflect the rates at
which one currency is exchanged for another currency. Another FX benchmark rate that a Barclays FX trader attempted
to manipulate is the Russian Ruble/U.S. Dollar Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME)/EMTA, Inc. benchmark rate
(CME/EMTA Rate) that is based on indicative bids and offers submitted by banks to the CME, who calculates and issues
the CME/EMTA Rate as well as publishes the submitted bids and offers of each participant.

FX benchmark rates, such as the WM/R Rates and the CME/EMTA Rate, are used for pricing of cross-currency swaps,
foreign exchange swaps, spot transactions, forwards, options, futures and other financial derivative instruments. For
example, the CME/EMTA Rate is the primary rate source for settling Russian Ruble non-deliverable forward transactions
and the price used for calculation of the CME Russian Ruble futures final settlement price at termination. Accordingly, the
integrity of the WM/R Rates and other FX benchmarks is critical to the integrity of the markets in the United States and
around the world.

The Order finds that certain FX traders at Barclays and other banks coordinated their trading or indicative rate
submissions to attempt to manipulate certain FX benchmark rates, including the WM/R 4 p.m. London fix and the
CME/EMTA Rate, to their benefit. These FX traders at Barclays and the other banks used private chat rooms to
communicate and plan their attempts to manipulate the FX benchmark rates. In these chat rooms, FX traders at the
Banks disclosed confidential customer order information and trading positions, altered trading positions or CME/EMTA
submissions to accommodate the interests of the collective group, and agreed on trading strategies as part of an effort
by the group to attempt to manipulate certain FX benchmark rates. These chat rooms were sometimes exclusive and
invitation only.
The Order also finds that Barclays failed to adequately assess the risks associated with its FX traders participating in the
fixing of certain FX benchmark rates and lacked adequate internal controls in order to prevent improper communications
by traders. In addition, Barclays lacked sufficient policies, procedures and training specifically governing participation in
trading and submission of indicative rates around the FX benchmarks rates; and Barclays had inadequate policies
pertaining to, or insufficient oversight of, its FX tradersâ use of chat rooms or other electronic messaging.

Some of this conduct occurred during the same period that the CFTC and other regulators were investigating attempts by
certain banks, including Barclays, to manipulate the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and other interest rate
benchmarks. The Commission took enforcement action against Barclays in connection with LIBOR in June 2012. Today, in
addition to the charges related to Barclaysâ misconduct in FX benchmark rates, the Commission took enforcement action
against Barclays and its affiliates on the same charges relating to abuses of the ISDAFIX benchmark. (See information
below.)

The Order recognizes the significant cooperation of Barclays during the CFTCâs Division of Enforcementâs investigation of
this matter.

The CFTC thanks and acknowledges the invaluable assistance of the U.S. Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the New York Department of Financial Services, and
the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for these cases are Robert Howell, Melissa Glasbrenner, Heather
Johnson, Jordon Grimm, David Chu, Elizabeth Streit, and Gretchen Lowe.

With Todayâs Action, the CFTC Has Imposed over $4.4 Billion in Penalties in 15 Actions against Banks and
Brokers to Address FX, LIBOR, and ISDAFIX Benchmark Abuses

With this Order, the CFTC has now imposed penalties of $1.875 billion on six banks for misconduct relating to foreign
exchange benchmarks. In addition, for similar misconduct relating to LIBOR, Euribor, ISDAFIX, and other interest rate
benchmark abuses the CFTC has imposed penalties of over $2.6 billion, for a total of over $4.6 billion in penalties in the
CFTCâs enforcement program focused on ensuring the integrity of global financial benchmarks.

14. âPlaintiff United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an

independent federal regulatory agency, charged by Congress with administering and enforcing

the Act, 7 US.C. Â§Â§ 1-26 (2012), and the Regulations promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R.
Â§Â§ 1.1-190.10 (2014).

15. | Defendant Gregory Christopher Evans is a resident of Kansas City, Missouri, and
between at least January 2013 through July 21, 2013 (the ârelevant periodââ), was employed as a
risk management consultant at a large futures commission merchant (âFCMâ) and provisionally
registered swap dealer (âSwap Dealerâ) (the âFirmââ) with offices located in Kansas City,
Missouri. Evans was registered as an associated person (âAPâ) of the FCM from November 21,
2012, until his resignation on July 21, 2013, and acted as an AP of the Swap Dealer during the
period January 1, 2013, until his resignation on July 21, 2013.

(2) Fraudulent Unauthorized Trades

16. Asarisk management consultant, Evans entered into bilateral energy swap
agreements on behalf of the Firm with the Firmâs customers as counterparties. To hedge â or
reduce â the risk from the swap agreements, Evans entered into futures trades on behalf of the
Firm on a futures exchange using the Firmâs central trading account.

17. | Evans was responsible for both discretionary and non-discretionary customer
accounts. A discretionary account is an arrangement by which the owner of the account provides
written power of attorney to someone else, usually the broker, to buy and sell without prior
approval of the account owner. A non-discretionary account is an arrangement by which a
broker must obtain prior approval from the account owner to buy and sell a particular contract.

18. During the relevant period, Evans executed a strategy to hedge fluctuations in
retail gasoline prices on behalf of a discretionary customer (âCustomer 1ââ).

19. During the spring of 2013, Evansâs discretionary trading strategy became

increasingly unprofitable and resulted in significant losses for Customer 1.

5
Case 4:14-cv-00839-ODS Document 27 Filed 06/16/15 Page 5 of 16
20. | To reduce and/or hide the losses from Customer 1 and bolster his own
compensation, Evans applied reverse mark-ups to transactions for Customer 1 and a customer
with a non-discretionary account (âCustomer 2â) and developed a scheme to engage in and
conduct unauthorized trades on behalf of Customer 2.

21. | The unauthorized trades entered into by Evans were bilateral NY MEX RBOB
Euro Swaps, which are swaps where two counterparties agree to exchange payment in the future
based on the change in price of a commodity contract, the NYMEX RBOB Euro Futures
contract.

22. The final price charged by the Firm to its customers for each bilateral energy
swap agreement was based on the price of the underlying futures contract, along with any âmark-
upâ or âreverse mark-up.â A âmark-upâ is the difference between the price the Firm paid for a
futures contract and the price charged the customer for the corresponding bilateral swap
agreement. Thus, a mark-up results in a profit for the Firm. Conversely, a âreverse mark-upâ
represents a better price for the customer for the bilateral swap agreement than the price actually
paid by the Firm for the corresponding futures contract. A reverse mark-up results in a gain to
the customer and a corresponding loss to the Firm.

23. As set forth in the Complaint, from May 23, 2013, to July 19, 2013, Evans
knowingly executed 30 unauthorized trades on behalf of Customer 2 that, after mark-ups and
reverse mark-ups, resulted in approximately $1,213,578.94 in trading losses to Customer 2.

24. Unable to recoup these losses, Evans resigned from the Firm on July 21, 2013.
Subsequently, the Firm compensated Customer 2 in full for the losses incurred as a result of

Evansâs unauthorized trades.

B. Conclusions of Law
(1) Jurisdiction and Venue

25. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 6c of the Act,
7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2012), which provides that whenever it shall appear to the CFTC that any
person has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a
violation of any provision of the Act or any rule, regulation, or order promulgated thereunder, the
CFTC may bring an action in the proper district court of the United States against such person to
enjoin such act or practice, or to enforce compliance with the Act, or any rule, regulation or order
thereunder. |

26. | Venue properly lies with this Court pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
Â§ 13a-1(e) (2012), because the acts and practices in violation of the Act occurred within this
District.

(2) Fraud by Unauthorized Trading in Violation of Sections 4b(a)(2) and 6(c)(1)
of the Act and Regulation 180.1

27. Section 4b(a)(2)(A), (C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6b(a)(2)(A), (C) (2012), makes it
unlawful for any person, in or in connection with any order to make, or the making of, any swap,
that is made, or to be made, for or on behalf of, or with, any other person, other than on or
subject to the rules of a designated contract market

(A) to cheat or defraud or attempt to cheat or defraud the other
person;

a 6

(C) willfully to deceive or attempt to deceive the other person by
any means whatsoever in regard to any order or contract or the
disposition or execution of any order or contract, or in regard to
any act of agency performed, with respect to any order or contract
for or... with the other person][. |

Section 6(c)(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 9(1) (2012), provides, in relevant part:

It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, to use or
employ, or attempt to use or employ, in connection with any swap
... any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance, in
contravention of such rules and regulations as the Commission
shall promulgate...

Regulation 180.1(a), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 180.1(a) (2014), was promulgated pursuant to

Section 6(c)(1) of the Act and provides, in relevant part:

30.

It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, in
connection with any swap ... to intentionally or recklessly:

(1) | Use or employ, or attempt to use or employ, any
manipulative device, scheme, or artifice to defraud;

(2) | Make, or attempt to make, any untrue or misleading
statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact
necessary in order to make the statements made not untrue or
misleading;

(3) Engage, or attempt to engage, in any act, practice, or course
of business, which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit
upon any person....

By the conduct described in the foregoing paragraphs, Defendant violated

Sections 4b(a)(2)(A), (C), and 6(c)(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6b(a)(2)(A), (C), 9(1) (2012), and

Regulation 180.1(a), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 180.1(a) (2014), by knowingly: (i) effecting swap transactions

effect those transactions; and (ii) willfully omitting material facts, including but not limited to,

the swap transactions Evans effected, the profits and losses incurred by those transactions, and

the magnitude of the risks to which Evans subjected the customerâs account.

(3) Fraud in Violation of the External Business Conduct Standards for Swap
Dealers (Regulation 23.410(a)(3))

31. Regulation 23.410(a)(3) makes it unlawful for any swap dealer or major swap
participant to âengage in any act, practice, or course of business that is fraudulent, deceptive, or
manipulative.â 17 C.F.R. Â§ 23.410(a)(3) (2014).

32. Regulation 23.401(d) defines âswap dealerâ for the purposes of the Business
Conduct Standards, see generally 17 C.F.R. pt.23, subpart H (2014), as âany person defined in
Section 1a(49) of the Act and Â§ 1.3 of this chapter and, as appropriate in this subpart, any person
acting for or on behalf of a swap dealer, including an associated person defined in Section 1a(4)
of the Act.â 17 C.F.R. Â§ 23.410(d) (2014). Section 1a(4) of the Act defines an âassociated
person of a swap dealerâ in relevant part as âa person who is associated with a swap dealer .. . as
... [an] employee, or agent (or any person occupying a similar status or performing similar
functions), in any capacity that involves (1) the solicitation or acceptance of swaps.â 7 U.S.C.

Â§ 1(a)(4)(A) (2012).

33. The Firm provisionally registered with the CFTC as a swap dealer effective
December 31, 2012.

34. During the relevant period and in connection with the facts alleged herein,
Defendant acted as an AP of a swap dealer because he engaged in the solicitation or acceptance
of swaps on behalf of the Firm. See 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1a(4)(A) (2012).

35. By the conduct described in the foregoing paragraphs, Defendant violated
Regulation 23.410(a)(3), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 23.410(a)(3) (2014), by: (i) knowingly effecting swap
transactions with a counter-party, Customer 2, without obtaining its authorization to effect those

transactions; and (ii) willfully omitting material facts, including, but not limited to, the swap

9
Case 4:14-cv-00839-ODS Document 27 Filed 06/16/15 Page 9 of 16
transactions he effected, the profits and losses incurred by those transactions, and the magnitude
of the risks to which he subjected Customer 2âs account.

(4) | Unauthorized Swap Transactions in Violation of Regulation 166.2

36. Regulation 166.2, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 166.2 (2014), makes it unlawful for an AP of an
FCM to effect a transaction in a commodity interest for a customer account unless, before the
transaction: (i) the customer has specifically authorized the AP to effect the transaction by |
specifying the precise commodity interest to be purchased or sold and the exact amount, or (11)
the customer has executed a written authorization (e.g., a âpower of attorneyâ) for the AP to
trade without the customerâs specific authorization.

37. As set forth in Regulation 1.3(yy)(4), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.3(yy)(4) (2014), a commodity
interest includes swaps as defined in the Act. Regulation 166.2, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 166.2 (2014),
requires that APs of FCMs effect only those transactions related to commodity interests that have
been specifically authorized.

38. | By the conduct described in the foregoing paragraphs, Defendant violated
Regulation 166.2, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 166.2 (2014), by effecting swap transactions for Customer 2âs
non-discretionary account without obtaining Customer 2âs authorization to effect those
transactions, while registered as an AP of an FCM.

39. Unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, there is a reasonable likelihood that
Defendant will continue to engage in the acts and practices alleged in the Complaint and in

similar acts and practices in violation of the Act and Regulations.

Missouri Federal Court Orders Gregory Christopher Evans to Pay a Penalty of over $1.2
Million for Fraud and Unauthorized Swaps Trading

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced that Senior Judge Ortrie
D. Smith of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri entered a Consent Order against Defendant
Gregory Christopher Evans imposing a civil monetary penalty of $1,213,578.94 and permanently banning Evans from
registering with the CFTC and engaging in any commodity-related activity, including swaps trading. Evans is a resident of
Kansas City, Missouri.

The Order resolves a CFTC enforcement action filed in September 2014, which charged Evans with fraud and
unauthorized trading in swaps (see CFTC Press Release and Complaint 7011-14).

The Order finds that between May 23, 2013 and July 19, 2013, Evans, who was employed as a risk management
consultant at a Futures Commission Merchant (FCM), engaged in fraud and unauthorized swaps trading. Specifically, the
Order finds that Evans knowingly executed 30 unauthorized swap transactions on behalf of one of the FCMâs customers
that resulted in approximately $1.2 million in trading losses to that customer. According to the Order, Evans engaged in
these unauthorized swap transactions to conceal prior trading losses from his customers and the FCM.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this action are Sophia Siddiqui, Dmitriy Vilenskiy, Jonah E.
McCarthy, Stephen Barrows, John Einstman, Rachel Hayes, and Paul G. Hayeck. Kevin Piccoli, Thomas J. Bloom, Jan
Ripplinger, and Lauren Fulks from the CFTC Division of Swap Dealer and Intermediary Oversight also assisted with this
matter.

QT. BINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Court, being fully advised in the premises, finds that there is good cause for the entry
of this Consent Order and that there is no just reason for delay. The Court therefore directs the
entry of the following Findings of Fact, Conclusion of Law, permanent injunction, and equitable
relief pursuant to Section 6(c) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(2012), as set forth herein,

A. Bindings of Fact
i, The Parties to This Consent Order

14, Plaintiff U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an independent
federal regulatory agency that is charged by Congress with the administration and enforcement
of the Act, 7 U.S.C, Â§Â§ 1 ef seq., and the Commission Regulations promulgated thereunder,

17 CER. Â§Â§ 1.1 ef seg. The Commission maintains its principal office at Three Lafayette
Centre, 1155 21"" Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20581.

15. Defendant Joseph F. Welsh IL resides in Northport, New York, From at least
June 2006 through May 2008 (the Relevant Period), Welsh was an associated person (AP) of MF
Global, Inc., a registered futures commission merchant (FCM) with its principal place of

business in New York, New York, At all times during the Relevant Period, as an AP of MF

 

 

 
Cassell decors 7 Sawer Deeanienn106?1 Aerecoeerd4ihs Aeagecscifit

Global, Welsh had the responsibility for, among other things, Ã©ntering orders for palladium and
platinum futures contracts on behalf of Christopher Louis Pia (Pia), a portfolio manager for
Moore Capital Management LLC (Moore Capital).

2, Other Relevant Individual

16. Chvistopher Louis Pia resides in North Castle, New York. During the Relevant
Period, Pia served as a portfolio manager of Moore Capital, which was a registered commodity

trading advisor (CTA). Pia was formerly registered as an AP of Moore Capital.

3. The New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) Palladium and Platinum
Futures Contracts

17, During the Relevant Period, palladium and platinum futures contracts traded on
the NYMEX, a contract market designated by the Commission for trading commodity futures
contracts. Both the NYMEX palladium and platinum futures contracts may be traded on the
NYMEX trading floor (also referred to as the trading pit) by open outery trading, with palladium
futures contracts trading from 8:30 a.m, to 1:00 p.m, Eastern Standard Time (EST) and platinum
futures contracts trading from 8:20 a.m. to 1:05 p.m. EST. Both NYMEX palladium and
platinum futures contracts also may be traded electronically on Globex, the Chicago Mercantile
Exchangeâs electronic trading platform, Sunday through Friday from 6:00 p.m. to 5:15 p.m, EST
with a 45 minute break between 5:15 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. EST. During the Relevant Period, the

majority of trades in NYMEX palladium and platinum futures contracts were executed on

Globex, rather than in the trading pit.

18. During the Relevant Period, the settlement prices of both the NYMEX palladium
and platinum futures contracts were calculated based on the volume-weighted average price of
all transactions conducted both on the trading floor and on Globex, during the two-minute

closing period for the contracts, The closing period for trading palladium futures contracts is
CasBelT2<cMOERFSaVAPY DecarisanlOG?l ASRBHOISIO4AES Heyqne Gaile

from 12:58 p.m. to 1:00 p.m. EST, and the closing period for trading platinum futures contracts
is from 1:03 p,m, to 1:05 p.m. EST. Globex and the trading pit trade side-by-side through the
close. Trading continues on Globex after the close of trading in the pit.

19, âTrading in both contracts was relatively illiquid, and Welshâs trading in both
futures contracts on the close on behalf of Pia frequently accounted for a significant portion of
the volume. Welshâs tracing strategy took advantage of these key characteristics of the
palladium and platinum futures marketsâthinly traded, illiquid, and volume-weighted average
settlement price calculationsââto attempt to manipulate the daily settlement prices.

4. Welsh Attempted to Manipulate the Prices of NYMILX Palladium and
Platinum Futures Contracts

20, During the Relevant Period, Pia or his execution clerks entered orders to Welsh
with instructions to exert upward pressure on the prices of NYMEX palladium and platinum
futures contracts, While employed as an associated person at MF Global, Welsh engaged in a
trading strategy in an attempt to manipulate upward the settlement prices of the palladium and
platinum futures contracts.

21, During the Relevant Period, Welsh placed Piaâs market-on-close (MOC) buy
orders in palladium and platinum futures contracts through a NYMEX floor clerk. Piaâs buy
orders were relatively large orders for the relatively illiquid palladium and platinum futures
contract markets. Typically, Piaâs orders constituted a large percentage of the volume of trading
on the close. Welsh routinely submitted Piaâs MOC buy orders in palladium and platinum
futures contracts to a floor broker by telephone over a recorded line. Welsh placed MOC orders

with the floor clerk with directions that indicated that he wanted to push the settlement prices

higher.

 

 

 

 

 
Cassell 2ccoter Saver Deeoieaen0641 AaRsnus6/04i65 FPaige 7cof i

22. To effectuate the manipulative scheme, Welsh waited until the last five or ten
seconds of the closing periods of platinum and palladium futures contract trading to place Piaâs
buy orders with a floor clerk who worked in the NYMEX trading pit. Welsh engaged in this
trading strategy throughout the Relevant Period and did so with the intent to manipulate the

prices of platinum and palladium futures contracts, including the settlement prices of those

contracts,
B, Conclusions of Law

1. Jurisdiction and Venue

23, This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 6c(a) of the Act,

7 ULS.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2012), which provides that whenever it shall appear to the Commission that
any person has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a
violation of any provision of the Act or any tule, regulation, or order thereunder, the Commission
may bring an action in the proper district court of the United States to enjoin such act or practice,
or to enforce cornpliance with the Act or any rule, regulation or order thereunder.

24. Venue properly lies with this Court pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
Â§ 13a-L(e) (2012), because Defendant transacted business in this District, and certain of the
transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business in violation of the Act occurred within this
District,

2, Violations of the Act

25, By the conduct described in paragraphs 1 through 22 above, Defendant violated

Sections 6(c), 6(d), and 9(a)(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C, Â§Â§ 9, 13b, and 13(a)(2) (2006).
Casde ine <cHosseaavAPr Decaniean0671 FamsOOSSI04iiS Feayeteatliem

similar acts and practices in violation of the Act.

Federal Court Orders a $500,000 Civil Penalty against Joseph F. Welsh III for Attempted
Manipulation of Palladium and Platinum Futures Contracts

Federal Court Order Also Imposes Trading Restriction

Washington, DC â The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) announced today that a federal court in
New York, New York, entered a Consent Order against Defendant Joseph F. Welsh III of Northport, New York, resolving
CFTC charges that Welsh attempted to manipulate the settlement prices of palladium and platinum futures contracts
traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).

The Order, issued by the Honorable William H. Pauley of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York,
assesses a civil monetary penalty of $500,000 and enjoins Welsh from violating the anti-manipulation provisions of the
Commodity Exchange Act, as charged in the Complaint (see CFTC Press Release and Complaint 6210-12, March 14,
2012). The Order also permanently bans Welsh from trading CFTC-regulated palladium and platinum products. In
addition, the Order requires Welsh to undertake compliance training and report annual completion thereof to the CFTC
for a period of five years.

According to the Order, from at least June 2006 through May 2008, Welsh, while working as a broker at MF Global, Inc.,
received market-on-close orders to buy palladium and platinum futures contracts from Christopher Louis Pia, a former
portfolio manager of Moore Capital Management LLC (a predecessor of Moore Capital Management, LP), with instructions
to exert upward pressure on prices. Welsh waited to enter Piaâs relatively large buy orders for the relatively illiquid
palladium and platinum futures contracts until the last five or ten seconds of the closing periods of those futures
contracts, with the intent to manipulate the prices of those futures contracts, including the settlement prices.

Previously, on July 25, 2011, the CFTC issued an Order filing and settling similar charges of attempted manipulation of
palladium and platinum futures prices against Pia. The CFTC Order required Pia to pay a $1 million civil monetary penalty
and permanently banned him from trading CFTC-regulated products during any closing period, and from trading CFTC-
regulated palladium and platinum products. The CFTC Order also imposed compliance undertakings related to Pia and
any entity Pia owns or controls and registration conditions if Pia or any of his entities become registered with the CFTC.
(See CFTC Press Release and Order 6079-11, July 25, 2011.)

In addition, on April 29, 2010, the CFTC issued an Order filing and settling similar charges of attempted manipulation of
palladium and platinum futures prices against Moore Capital Management, LP and Moore Capital Advisors, LLC,
both based in New York, and Moore Advisors, Ltd., a Bahamian entity. The CFTC Order required all three entities jointly
and severally to pay a $25 million civil monetary penalty and placed restrictions on their CFTC registrations, including a
two-year restriction on trading during the closing periods of palladium and platinum futures and options markets. (See
CFTC Press Release and Order 5815-10, April 29, 2010.)

The CFTC wishes to thank the CME Group, the parent company of the NYMEX, for its assistance.

The following CFTC staff members are responsible for this case: Kara Mucha, Janine M. Gargiulo, Jo E. Mettenburg, Kassra
Goudarzi, James A. Garcia, Michael Solinsky, Charles D. Marvine, and Gretchen L. Lowe.

COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, CIVIL MONETARY PENALTIES,
AND OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF UNDER THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT

Plaintiff U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (Commission) alleges as follows:
1. SUMMARY

1. Since at least July 2014 through at least May 26, 2015 (the Relevant Period), Nick
A. Wurl (Wurl) and his company Ludiera Capital LLC (Ludiera) (together, Defendants) have
defrauded at least 46 individuals and entities who contributed more than $9 million to an
investment pool operated by Ludiera that trades commodity future contracts (futures) and options
on futures (options).

2. In approximately May 2013, Defendants established the Ludiera Diversified
Opportunity Portfolio L.P. (the Pool). Defendants subsequently marketed the Pool to
participants as a safe and well-capitalized limited partnership established to supply operating
capital to Ludiera for its purported physical commodity trading. In reality, the Pool was little
more than a shell company used to defraud Pool participants and enrich Defendants at their

expense.
Case: 1:15-cv-05585 Document #: 1 Filed: 06/23/15 Page 2 of 28 PagelD #:2

3. Defendants went to great lengths to convince Pool participants that Defendants
operated a well-capitalized, reputable, and established physical commodity trading firm. To that
end, Defendants solicited funds from individuals and entities for the represented purpose of
investing in their physical commodity trading business. In making these solicitations,
Defendants represented, among other things, that they were engaged in the purchase, transport,
and sale of physical commodities. Defendants characterized the investment opportunity as a âno
riskâ strategy and assured Pool participants that the worst potential outcome was no gain on their
investment.

4. This portrait of Defendants is a sham. In reality, Defendants never engaged in
physical commodity trading. Instead of using Pool participantsâ money to purchase, sell, and
transport commodities, Defendants diverted Pool participantsâ funds to their own bank and
trading accounts. Defendants then used the bulk of the Pool participantsâ fundsâover $6.8
millionâto trade futures and options, including futures and options on equity indices,
agricultural commodities, and energy commodities. Defendants also misappropriated over
$600,000 of Poo! participantsâ funds to pay their credit card debts, to make automobile purchases
and to use for additional items and expenses.

5. Through their trading of futures and options, Defendants lost more than $3.3
million of Pool funds. Defendants never disclosed to Pool participants that they used a
significant portion of Pool participant funds to trade futures and options. Defendants never made
any disclosures to Pool participants regarding the massive losses sustained by Defendants trading
futures and options with Pool funds. Further, Defendants affirmatively misrepresented to Pool

participants that Defendants were not engaged in the trading of futures and options.
Case: 1:15-cv-05585 Document #: 1 Filed: 06/23/15 Page 3 of 28 PagelD #:3

6. Additionally, to perpetuate their fraud, Defendants operated the Pool as a Ponzi
scheme through which they used Pool participant funds to pay other Pool participants a total of
approximately $1.8 million as redemptions.

7. Throughout the duration of the scheme, Defendants regularly prepared and
distributed to Pool participants false monthly account statements. These false monthly account
statements purport to reflect physical commodity transactions that never took place and falsely
represent growth in value of Pool participantsâ interests in the Pool. Defendants consistently
misrepresented to Pool participants, both orally and through these false account statements, that
Pool participantsâ interests in the Pool were continuing to grow significantly in value.

8. By the aforementioned conduct, and the conduct described herein, Defendants
have engaged, are engaging in, or are about to engage in practices that violate the provisions of
the Commodity Exchange Act (âActâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1 et seg. (2012), and Commission
Regulations (âRegulationsâ), 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1.1 ef seg. (2014). Specifically, they have engaged,
are engaging or are about to engage in acts or practices in violation of Sections 4b(a)(1)(A)-(C),
4c(b), 4k(2), 4m(1), 40(1), and 6(c)(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6b(a)(1)(A)-(C), 6c(b), 6k(2),
6m(1), 60(1), 9(1) (2012); and Regulations 4.20, 33.10, and 180.1, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 4.20, 33.10,
180.1 (2014)

9. Pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2012), the Commission
brings this action to permanently enjoin Defendantsâ unlawful acts and practices, to compel their
compliance with the Act and the Regulations thereunder, and to permanently enjoin them from
engaging in any commodity-related activity.

â10. When Wurl committed the acts, omissions, and failures described herein, he did

so within the scope of his agency, employment, and office with Ludiera; therefore, Wurlâs acts,
Case: 1:15-cv-05585 Document #: 1 Filed: 06/23/15 Page 4 of 28 PagelD #:4

omissions, and failures are deemed those of Ludiera pursuant to Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act,
7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(a)(1)(B) (2012), and Regulation 1.2, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.2 (2014).

11. At all times relevant to this Complaint, Wurl controlled Ludiera, directly or
indirectly, and did not act in good faith or knowingly induced, directly or indirectly, the acts of
Ludiera described herein; therefore, Wurl is liable for the violations by Ludiera of the Act and
Regulations described herein pursuant to Section 13(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13c(b) (2012).

12. Accordingly, pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2012), the
Commission brings this action to permanently enjoin Defendantsâ unlawful acts and practices
and to compel their compliance with the Act and Regulations and to further enjoin Defendants
from engaging in any commodity-related activity. In addition, the Commission seeks civil
monetary penalties and remedial ancillary relief, including, but not limited to, trading and
registration bans, restitution, disgorgement, rescission, pre- and post-judgment interest, and other
such relief as the Court may deem necessary and appropriate.

13. Unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, there is a reasonable likelihood that
Defendants will continue to engage in the acts and practices alleged in this Complaint, and
similar acts and practices, as more fully described below.

II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

14. The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 6c of the Act,

7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2012), because it appears to the Commission that Defendants have engaged,
are engaging, or are about to engage in conduct that constitutes a violation of the Act and the

Regulations.
Case: 1:15-cv-05585 Document #: 1 Filed: 06/23/15 Page 5 of 28 PagelD #:5.

15. Venue properly lies with the Court pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
Â§ 13a-1(e) (2012), in that Defendants reside and transact business in this District and acts and
practices in violation of the Act and Regulations have occurred within this District.

Ill. PARTIES

16.â Plaintiff U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an independent
federal regulatory agency that is charged by Congress with the administration and enforcement
of the Act and the Regulations promulgated thereunder. The Commission maintains its principal
office at Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21"" Street NW, Washington, DC 20581.

17. Defendant Nick A. Wurl is a resident of Chicago, Illinois. Wurl owns Ludiera
and is the President, Director, Chairman, and Managing Member of Ludiera. At all times, and
with respect to all conduct described in this Complaint, Wurl has exercised sole ownership and
control over Ludiera. Wurl also has managed and directed other employees of Ludiera who
acted on Ludieraâs behalf. Wurl, either himself or through others acting at his direction, has
solicited customers for Ludiera; has prepared and distributed or has directed others to prepare
and distribute disclosure documents, transaction updates, marketing materials, and other
literature used to solicit customers for Ludiera; and has executed or directed others to execute
futures and options trades on behalf of Ludiera, all of which occurred within the scope of Wurlâs
agency, employment, or office with Ludiera. During the Relevant Period, Wurl was an
associated person (AP) of Ludiera, though Wurl has never been registered with the Commission
in any capacity.

18. Defendant Ludiera Capital LLC is a Delaware limited liability company with its
principal place of business at 733 N. LaSalle St., 3â Floor, Chicago, IL 60654. Wurl is the

owner, President, Director, Chairman, and Managing Member of Ludiera. Ludiera is engaged in
Case: 1:15-cv-05585 Document #: 1 Filed: 06/23/15 Page 6 of 28 PagelD #:6

a business that is of the nature of a commodity pool, investment trust, syndicate, or similar form
of enterprise, and, in connection therewith, solicited, accepted, or received from others, funds,
securities, or property, for the purpose of trading in commodity interests. During the Relevant
Period, Ludiera was the commodity pool operator (CPO) for the Pool, though Ludiera has never
been registered with the Commission in any capacity.

IV. FACTS
A. Background Information Regarding Defendants and the Pool

19. On March 13, 2013, Wurl formed Ludiera in Delaware as a limited liability
company.

20. Atall times during the Relevant Period, Wurl owned Ludiera and served as its
President, Director, Chairman, and Managing Member.

21. According to its website, Ludiera was founded in 2009 and has since âgrown from
being a North America niche player in derivatives trading to a highly diversified commodity
trading and investment management company integrating physical commodity trading, real asset
management, and logistics services into one financially sound entity.â

22.  Ludiera purports to trade physical commodities, including agricultural and energy
products. Ludiera claims that, in conjunction with its physical commodity trading activities, it
* can provide âcomplex hedging structures as a part of each physical contract to provide customers
with enhanced price risk mitigation.â

23. On May 15, 2013, Defendants created the Pool and named Ludiera as the Poolâs

general partner.
Case: 1:15-cv-05585 Document #: 1 Filed: 06/23/15 Page 7 of 28 PagelD #:7

24. Defendants created the Pool purportedly to provide operating capital to Ludiera in
furtherance of its purchase, sale, and transport of commodities around the world through its
network of trading counterparties.

25. The Poolâs Private Placement Memoranda dated July 8, 2014 and October 1, 2014
(together, the PPMs) describe the Pool as a âphysical commodity trading and asset management
company.â The PPMs claim that the Pool leverages âthe network of commodity buyers and
processing firms with the goal of providing reliable commodity supplies at competitive prices to
end users around the world.â

B. Defendantsâ Fraudulent Solicitation of Pool Participants

26. Throughout the Relevant Period, Defendants, acting directly or through their
agents, employees, or officers, solicited approximately $9 million from at least 46 individuals
and entities for the represented purpose of purchasing, selling, and transporting physical
commodities.

27. Defendants solicited existing and prospective participants of the Pool through in-
person meetings, phone calls, and email communications.

28. Defendants provided marketing materials for Ludiera and for the Pool to existing
and prospective participants of the Pool. Wurl personally orchestrated and distributed these
marketing materials and was responsible for Ludieraâs solicitation practices.

29. Defendants utilized the mail and/or other means or instrumentalities of interstate
commerce to (1) distribute the PPMs to existing and prospective participants of the Pool;

(2) distribute transactional statements to participants; (3) portray Ludieraâs purported business

model and strategy to the public via its website; and (4) provide information to existing and
Case: 1:15-cv-05585 Document #: 1 Filed: 06/23/15 Page 8 of 28 PagelD #:8

potential participants of the Pool regarding the purported business strategy, activity, and

profitability of the Pool.

30.

Throughout the Relevant Period, Defendants made numerous misrepresentations

of material fact to existing and potential Pool participants to convince them to invest with

Defendants and to remain invested with Defendants. Specifically, Defendants falsely told

existing and prospective Pool participants that:

31.

a.

Defendants would invest Pool participantsâ funds in the buying and selling of
physical commodities;

Defendants were in the business of âsourc[ing] and mov[ing] physical
commodities from areas of high supply to areas of high demand through its
network of end users and both United States and foreign domiciled entitiesâ;
Defendantsâ trading in physical commodities was generating profits for Pool
participants;

Defendants were not engaged in the trading of futures or options;

Defendants had established a segregated bank account with J.P. Morgan Chase in
the name of the Pool into which the participantsâ funds would be deposited;

Pool participantsâ investment with Defendants was low-risk, if not entirely risk-
free; and

The worst potential outcome for Pool participants was a 0% return on investment.

Defendants concocted elaborate and false stories about physical commodity

transactions in order to convince participants to invest in their scheme. For example, Wurl

falsely described to a then-prospective Pool participant a method of doing business that he

claimed Defendants utilized:
Case: 1:15-cv-05585 Document #: 1 Filed: 06/23/15 Page 9 of 28 PagelD #:9

32.

The way we earn money for our partners is [] by negotiating an agreement
to buy the requested physical commodity at a given price from one of our
origination facilities and at the same time we sell the same commodities
on contract to one of our contacts who is looking to purchase . . . [.] When
they buy, they transfer the whole amount of money that weâre due to an
escrow account in Ludiera Capitalâs name so that we can verify that the
funds exist before we sell the product. After weâve determined the
location that we are buying the commodities from, we then locate shipping
capacity (either a train, barge, or ocean faring vessel) and arrange for the
product to be picked up at the location where we bought it. When our
contracted transportation picks the product up, our insurance policy,
underwritten by the United States Export Import Bank (backed by the
United States Government) protects Ludiera on the full value of the
product [] in the event that some part of the transaction does not go as
planned ... When the product arrives to the buyerâs port, the full value of
the escrow account is released to Ludiera Capital and the profit on the
transaction is divided amongst our partners.

* * *

In a worst case scenario, if no trading opportunities exist in the world, we
would simply wait. Our worst possible outcome would be a return of 0%
in a year (assuming no deals were available to be made, an occurrence that
has not happened over a prolonged period in the history of global trade).

Defendantsâ misrepresentations caused participants to invest, invest additional

money, and convince others to invest with Defendants.

33.

Throughout the Relevant Period, Defendants failed to disclose material facts to

the Poolâs participants, including that:

34.

a.

A significant portion of participantsâ funds would be used to trade futures and
options;

Defendants were sustaining significant losses trading futures and options; and
There is risk, including the risk of loss of principal, associated with the trading of
futures and options.

Contrary to Defendantsâ representations regarding their operations, at no time

were they engaged in the purchase, sale, or transportation of physical commodities. Instead,
Case: 1:15-cv-05585 Document #: 1 Filed: 06/23/15 Page 10 of 28 PagelD #:10

Defendants utilized Pool participant funds for speculative trading in futures and options using
accounts in Wurlâs and Ludieraâs names. Further, Defendants misappropriated Pool participant
funds for their own use, as described below.

35. Contrary to Defendantsâ representations, Defendants also failed to operate the
Pool as a separate legal entity. In particular, Defendants never opened a separate bank account
for the Pool as they claimed and deposited Pool participant funds directly into Ludieraâs account,
where it was then subsequently transferred to trading accounts in the names of Ludiera and Wurl,
as well as Wurlâs personal bank account.

36. Defendants made all of these false statements to Pool participants and prospective
Pool participants knowingly or with reckless disregard for the truth.

C. Defendants Commingled and Misappropriated Poo] Funds

37. The Pool was little more than a shell company used as a marketing device for
soliciting contributions of capital. The Pool had no independent function or capitalization
separate and apart from Ludiera itself, or even its own bank account.

38. | Defendants deposited the Pool participantsâ funds into a checking account in the
name of Ludiera at Bank A (the Ludiera bank account). Wurl is the sole signatory on the
Ludiera bank account.

39. Defendants never used any Pool participantsâ funds for the purchase, sale, or
transport of physical commodities.

40. Instead, Defendants transferred the bulk of Pool participantsâ funds from the
Ludiera bank account to, and between, other bank and trading accounts in the name of Ludiera or

Wurl:

10
Case: 1:15-cv-05585 Document #: 1 Filed: 06/23/15 Page 11 of 28 PagelD #:11

a. Defendants made approximately $1.4 million in net transfers of Pool
participantsâ funds from the Ludiera bank account to Wurlâs personal bank account at

Bank A. Wurl then made approximately $1.2 million in net transfers of those funds to his

personal account at Futures Commission Merchant (FCM) A, where he lost the funds

trading primarily futures and options.
b. Defendants transferred approximately $5.6 million in Pool participantsâ
funds from the Ludiera bank account to Ludieraâs trading accounts at FCM A and

FCM B, as well as to invest in a limited partnership interest with a hedge fund.

Defendants lost approximately $2.1 million in those accounts by trading primarily futures

and options. Collectively, approximately $3.5 million in Pool participantsâ funds,

remains in Ludieraâs trading accounts.

41. During the Relevant Period, Defendants spent at least $500,000 of Pool
participantsâ funds to pay for Ludieraâs credit card debts, automobile purchases, and additional
items and expenses.

42. During the Relevant Period, Wurl spent at least $100,000 of the Pool
participantsâ funds for his own personal use, including payments totaling at least $68,000 for his
credit card debts.

43. To disguise their trading losses and misappropriation, Defendants distributed a
sum of approximately $1.8 million to Pool participants as redemptions, i.e. ""Ponzi payments,""
when in fact the majority of these funds consisted of other Pool participants' principal.

44. Defendants told pool participants that Ludiera would charge either a one percent
or half a percent annual âmanagement feeâ based on the total Pool assets. Defendants never

attempted to abide by this fee structure, however, and treated the entirety of Pool participantsâ

11
Case: 1:15-cv-05585 Document #: 1 Filed: 06/23/15 Page 12 of 28 PagelD #:12

contributions as available for their use in Ludieraâs and Wurl's futures and options trading
accounts, as well as for their personal use.

45. Defendants committed these acts of misappropriation knowingly or with reckless
disregard for the truth.

D. False Statements and Documents

46. Defendants created, distributed, or otherwise utilized with existing and potential
Pool participants several types of documents that furthered their fraudulent scheme, including
fake audited financial statements for Ludiera and its subsidiaries that purported to be conducted
by a top international accounting firm; fake bank account statements; and fake statements
documenting Ludieraâs purchase, sale, and transport of commodities.

47, Defendants created, distributed or otherwise utilized these documents in an effort
to convince existing and potential Pool participants of the legitimacy and profitability of
Defendantsâ operations. For instance, Defendants used several fabricated documents to convince
existing and potential Pool participants to contribute to the Pool, including:

a. Ludiera bank statements reflecting transactions in the range of $30-40 million per
month;

b. A document purportedly reflecting a grain purchase by Ludiera on October 19,
2014 of 1.75 million bushels of soybeans at $10.85 per bushel and its shipment to
Tokyo, Japan;

c. A document purportedly reflecting a sale by Ludiera on October 31, 2014 of
720,000 metric tons of soybeans for shipment from the United States to China;

d. An âEscrow Agreementâ dated April 10, 2013 between LUDIERA CAPITAL,

LLC and C[redacted]RP TRUSTEE COMPANY LIMITED; C[redacted]NK.

12
Case: 1:15-cv-05585 Document #: 1 Filed: 06/23/15 Page 13 of 28 PagelD #:13

N.A.; and C[redactedJNK INTERNATIONAL PLC governing custody of
Ludieraâs contribution of the âestimated transaction value of commodities.â

48. | These documents were presented to participants and potential participants during
face-to-face meetings, as well as through emails sent by Defendants.

49. Defendants also sent fake transaction statements to Pool participants by email,
generally monthly to bi-monthly, in conjunction with the purported completion of transactions
by Ludiera. The transactional statements represented that they were statements of âTransaction
History â Physical Commodity Trading Fund.â The transactional statements identified the
number of shares purportedly held by the respective Pool participant, consistently showing
increases in the share value of the respective Pool participant.

50. The transactional statements contained information purportedly showing
transactions associated with the physical purchase, transportation, and sale of commodities,
including noting deductions for the price of the commodity purchased, insurance, shipping
services, and tax withholding, as well as credits for the sale price-of the commodity upon
purported delivery. All of these statements were created by Defendants and all were completely
false. Defendants did not buy, transport, or sell physical commodities. Likewise the associated
entries for insurance on commodity transport, transportation costs, or taxes withheld were
completely false.

Sl. Moreover, the Pool participantsâ investment did not increase-in value. To the
contrary, Defendantsâ trading in futures and options resulted in trading losses of approximately

$3.3 million and experienced additional losses on account of Defendantsâ misappropriation.

13
Case: 1:15-cv-05585 Document #: 1 Filed: 06/23/15 Page 14 of 28 PagelD #:14

52. Participants relied on the false information contained in these statements in
deciding to initially invest, to make additional investment, and/or to recommend to others that
they also invest.

53. Defendants created, distributed, or otherwise utilized all of the false documents
described herein knowingly or with reckless disregard for the truth.

CFTC Charges Illinois Resident Nick A. Wurl and His Company Ludiera Capital LLC with
Fraud and Misappropriation in $9 Million Scheme

Defendants allegedly defrauded at least 46 participants in an
investment pool

Wurl was charged with wire fraud in a related criminal action

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) filed a federal enforcement action in the
U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against Defendants Nick A. Wurl and his company Ludiera Capital
LLC, both of Chicago, Illinois, charging them with fraud, misappropriation, and the issuance of false statements in
connection with an investment pool they operated that traded commodity futures contracts and options on futures
contracts. According to the CFTC Complaint, âIn reality, the pool was little more than a shell company used to defraud
pool participants and enrich Defendants at their expense.â

On May 27, 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), in a related criminal complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for
the Northern District of Illinois, charged Wurl with wire fraud. In conjunction with that action, DO) obtained writs of
garnishment against known accounts in the names of Wurl and Ludiera.

The CFTCâs Complaint alleges that Defendants fraudulently solicited over $9 million from at least 46 investors for the
represented purpose of trading physical commodities, such as soybeans and other agricultural commodities, as well as
energy products. In their solicitations, Defendants fraudulently represented that (1) Defendants would only invest
participantsâ funds in the buying and selling of physical commodities; (2) Defendantsâ physical commodity trading was
generating profits for participants; (3) Defendants were not engaged in the trading of futures or options; (4) participantsâ
funds would be maintained in segregated accounts; and (5) the worst potential outcome for investors was O percent
return on investment.

According to the Complaint, and contrary to the represented investment strategy, Defendants never engaged in physical
commodity trading. Rather, the bulk of participantsâ funds â over $6.8 million â was pooled and used by Defendants to
trade futures and options. Defendants never disclosed to participants the risk of trading futures and options and never
disclosed that a significant portion of participantsâ funds would be used for trading futures and options. Further,
Defendants never disclosed that Defendants were sustaining significant trading losses. Rather, Defendants operated to
conceal their commingling and misappropriation of customer funds and trading losses by providing pool participants with
false reports and account statements showing fictitious profits.

The CFTC Complaint also alleges that Defendants misappropriated at least $600,000 of participantsâ funds to pay down
personal credit card debt and purchase vehicles, among other things. Akin to a Ponzi scheme, and in order to further
disguise their trading losses and misappropriation, the Defendants also distributed approximately $1.8 million to pool
participants in redemptions, utilizing other pool participantsâ principal to fund these payments.

In its continued litigation, the CFTC seeks restitution, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, civil monetary penalties,
permanent registration and trading bans, and preliminary and permanent injunctions from further violations of the
federal commodities laws, as charged.

The CFTC thanks and acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Northern District of Illinois and the
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this action are Rachel Hayes, Rebecca Jelinek, Stephen
Turley, Lauren Fulks, Diane Romaniuk, Peter Riggs, and Charles Marvine.

EX PARTE STATUTORY RESTRAINING ORDER
AND ASSET FREEZE

Plaintiff, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ or âCFTCâââ),
has filed a Complaint for Injunctive and Other Equitable Relief and Civil Monetary Penalties
under the Commodity Exchange Act and moved, pursuant to Section 6c(a) of the Commodity
Exchange Act (the âActâ), for an ex parte statutory restraining order freezing assets, and
prohibiting the destruction of books, records, or other documents. This Court has considered the
pleadings, declaration, exhibits, and memorandum filed in support of the Commissionâs Motion
for Ex Parte Statutory Restraining Order (âSROâ) and finds that:

1. This Court has jurisdiction over the parties and over the subject matter of this
action pursuant to Sections 2(c)(2) and 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 2(c)(2) and 13a-1 (2012)
which authorizes the Commission to seek injunctive relief against any person whenever it shall

appear that such person has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in any act or practice
Case: 1:15-cv-05839 Document #: 14 Filed: 07/02/15 Page 2 of 8 PagelD #:145

constituting a violation of any provision of the Act or any rule, regulation or order thereunder.

2. Venue lies properly within this District pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act, 7
U.S.C. Â§13a-1(e) (2012), in that the Defendants are found, inhabit, or transact business in this
District, or the acts and practices in violation of the Act have occurred, are occurring or are about
to occur within this District.

3, There is good cause to believe that Defendants have engaged in, are engaging in,
or are about to engage in violations of 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6b(a)(1)(A), (C) and 6c(a) (2012) and 17
C.F.R. Â§ 1.38(a) (2014). Weighing the equities and considering the Commissionâs likelihood of
success in its claims for relief, the issuance of an SRO is in the public interest.

4. There is good cause for the Court to freeze certain assets owned, controlled,
managed, or held by or on behalf of, or for the benefit of Defendants. Absent the entry of this
statutory restraining order, Defendants are likely to dissipate or transfer assets and destroy
business records.

5. There is good cause for entry of an order prohibiting Defendants, their agents,
servants, employees, assigns, attorneys, and persons in active concert or participation with
Defendants, including any successor thereof, from destroying records and/or denying agents of
the Commission access to inspect and copy records to ensure that Commission representatives
have immediate and complete access to those books and records.

6. There is good cause to believe that immediate and irreparable damage to the
Courtâs ability to grant effective final relief in the form of monetary redress will occur from the
sale, transfer, assignment, or other disposition by Defendants of assets or records unless
Defendants are immediately restrained and enjoined by Order of the Court.

7. This is a proper case for granting an ex parte statutory restraining order to
Case: 1:15-cv-05839 Document #: 14 Filed: 07/02/15 Page 3 of 8 PagelD #:146

preserve the status quo and enable the Commission to fulfill its statutory duties.

CFTC Files Enforcement Action against Chinese National Yumin Li and BVI Company
Kering Capital Ltd. for Defrauding a CME Member in an Illegal Trading Scheme

Li and Kering Capital Charged with Defrauding Liâs Employer and
Misappropriation through a Scheme Involving Fictitious and Non-
Competitive Trading

Court Enters Restraining Order Freezing Defendantsâ Accounts and
Protecting Books and Records

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today filed a civil enforcement action
charging Defendants Yumin LI, a citizen of the Peopleâs Republic of China, and Kering Capital Ltd., a British Virgin
Islands (BVI) company owned by Liâs mother, with fraud, engaging in fictitious transactions, and trading
noncompetitively, in violation of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations. Neither Li nor Kering Capital has
ever been registered with the CFTC.

On July 2, 2015, the Honorable Sara L. Ellis, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, issued a restraining
Order freezing Defendantsâ trading accounts and prohibiting them from destroying documents and denying CFTC staff
access to books and records.

The CFTC Complaint, filed on July 1, 2015, alleges that Li was an employee of an individual with trading privileges on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). According to the Complaint, on six separate occasions over the course of seven
weeks between March 17, 2015 and May 6, 2015, Li and Kering Capital engaged in a series of unlawful money passes
involving the Eurodollar contract traded on the CMEâs electronic Globex platform. Li misappropriated approximately
$300,000 from her employer by trading the employerâs account noncompetitively against an account belonging to Kering
Capital that Li controlled, the Complaint charges.

Further, according to the Complaint, in each of the money passes Li placed an order for the Kering Capital account to buy
or sell a Eurodollar âbutterfly spreadâ at a certain quantity and at a certain price. She then placed a second order for her
employerâs account on the opposite side of the market in the same product for the same quantity and the same price.
After the orders were matched, Li entered into offsetting transactions to close out the position. As alleged, in each
instance, Li structured the transactions such that her employerâs account would always buy at higher prices and sell at
lower prices opposite the account Li controlled at Kering Capital, with the result that the Kering Capital account profited
and her employerâs account incurred a loss.

Li concentrated her trading in illiquid Eurodollar contracts with expiration dates that were five or more years beyond the
trade date, according to the Complaint. She also traded outside of regular CME trading hours so that there would be
fewer market participants trading, and she would have a better chance of matching her orders, according to the
Complaint.

According to the complaint, Kering Capital is a trading company formed in the BVI in November 2014 by Liâs mother, who
is its Chief Executive Officer and sole shareholder.

In its continuing litigation, the CFTC seeks restitution, civil monetary penalties, trading and registration bans, and a
permanent injunction against further violations of the federal commodities laws.

The CFTC thanks the CME Group, Inc. for its assistance in this matter.

The CFTC staff members responsible for this action are Lindsey Evans, Melissa Cavers, David Terrell, Venice Bickham,
Scott Williamson, and Rosemary Hollinger.

Il, FINDINGS OF FACT

17. In early 2008, Wright, who is a teacher and is also the owner of a painting
business, opened a futures trading account in his own name with a futures commission merchant
(âFCMâ) registered with the Commission. In his account application, Wright stated that his
investment objective was to speculate and that no other person would have an interest in the
account.

18. Beginning in or about August 2008, Wright began to solicit funds from friends
and acquaintances. He told some individuals that the funds were loans for his painting business
or that the funds would be used to purchase gas stations. He told other individuals that their
funds would be used to trade commodities,

19. Wright provided at least some of these individuals with documents entitled
âSpecial Renewable Note Agreementâ (âNotesâ). At least some of these Notes stated that the
funds provided would be invested in âcrude oil futures,â âgrain futures,â or âcurrency futures.â
These agreements confirmed the amount received from the participant and also specified that the
participant would receive a specific repayment, which included a profit at a stated rate of interest

varying between 10 and 30 percent. Most of these Notes had terms of no more than 2-6 months.

5

NO0G2-RLYV-DSC Document6 Filed 1o/28/13 Page 5 of 15

   

 

 
20. Wright told at least some of the participants that he was the managing partner of a
commodity pool and that he would send their funds to be traded by a firm called âCommodity
Investment Group.â Some of the Notes Wright provided to participants appeared to be printed
on âCommodity Investment Groupâ letterhead, but, in fact, Wright designed and printed those
documents on his home computer. Wright signed the Notes as the âManaging Partnerâ of the
Commodity Investment Group.

21, Regardless of what Wright told these individuals, he instructed all participants to
make their checks payable to him personally and then deposited those funds into his personal
banking account,

22. Wright did not transfer any funds to a firm named âCommodity Investment
Groupâ and Wright is not the managing partner of any such firm.

23. Wright received at least $1 million in participant funds, of which he wired
approximately $200,000 into his futures trading account. Wright did not, in fact, use most of
those funds to trade commodity futures. Instead, Wright transferred approximately $147,000
back out of his futures trading account to his bank account, often after holding the funds in the
account for only a short period of time. Wright lost approximately $60,000 in trading activities.

24. Wright used the remaining funds to pay back Pool participants in a manner of a
Ponzi scheme and to pay his own personal expenses.

25.  Wrightâs statements to Pool participants were false because he knew that he was
not trading the vast majority of the funds that he received, he knew that there was no firm called
âCommodity Investment Groupâ to which he was transferring funds, he knew that he could not

meet the terms of the promissory notes through legitimate investments, and he knew that he was

6

Case 5:13-cv-00002-RLY-DSC Document6 Filed 10/28/13 Page 6 of 15

 

 
misappropriating the majority of the funds he received to pay supposed returns to participants
and to support his lifestyle.

26. Wright used the United States Postal Service, or other private or commercial
catrier, to receive and make at least some of the payments to Pool participants.

27. On March 22, 2013, Wright was served with a search warrant by the United States
Postal Inspector and the North Carolina Bureau of Investigation. At that time, Wright gave an
informal statement in which he admitted, among other things, that he had solicited funds from
friends and acquaintances, telling at least some of them that their investments would be used to
trade commodities futures contracts, but that he had not used most of the funds to trade
commodities futures, instead using the funds to pay supposed returns to his investors. Wright
also admitted that he created the promissory Notes that he provided to some investors on his
home computer and he claimed that no one else knew that the investments were fraudulent.

Ii. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

The Court, being fully advised in the premises, finds that there is good cause for the entry
of this Consent Order and that there is no just reason for delay. The Court therefore directs the
entry of the following Conclusions of Law, permanent injunction and equitable relief pursuant to

participants with Notes that promised a fixed return of 10-30%; (c) making material

instrumentalities of interstate commerce including (a) using the United States Postal Service or
other private or commercial interstate carrier to send payments to Pool participants, and
(b) wiring funds to and from his commodity futures trading account.

35. Wright engaged in the acts and practices described above knowingly or with

Federal Court Orders North Carolina Resident Carl David Wright to Pay a $1 Million Civil
Penalty for Commodity Pool Fraud

In a parallel criminal action in 2014, Wright was sentenced to four years
in prison and ordered to pay $817,975 as restitution

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced that the Honorable
Richard L. Voorhees of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina entered a Supplemental Order
imposing a $1 million civil monetary penalty against Defendant Carl David Wright, of Iron Station, North Carolina, for
operating a commodity pool fraud in violation of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA). The Court previously on October
28, 2013, entered a Consent Order finding that Wright committed fraud in connection with a commodity pool Ponzi
scheme. The Consent Order also imposes a permanent trading and registration ban on Wright and prohibits him from
violating the Commodity Exchange Act, as charged.

The Courtâs Orders arise out of the CFTC enforcement action filed on June 24, 2013, charging Wright with violating the
anti-fraud provisions of the CEA by fraudulently soliciting and accepting at least $1 million from approximately 16
customers (see CFTC Complaint and Press Release 6618-13). According to the Consent Order, although Wright told
participants that their funds would be invested in a variety of investments, including commodity futures, he in fact
misappropriated most of the funds, using them to pay personal expenses and to make so-called profit payments to
participants.

The CFTC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Western District of North Carolina in this matter.
In a parallel criminal action based upon the same underlying facts, District Judge Robert C. Conrad of the U.S. District
Court for the Western District of North Carolina in October 2014 sentenced Wright to four years in prison and ordered
Wright to pay $817,975 as restitution to injured customers (United States of America v. Wright, No. 13-cr-186).

The CFTC cautions victims that restitution orders may not result in the recovery of money lost because the wrongdoers
may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers and to
ensure the wrongdoers are held accountable.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Jennifer E. Smiley, Mary Beth Spear, Ava Gould,
Scott Williamson, and Rosemary Hollinger.

I. SUMMARY
A. Parties
14. _â~ Plaintiff U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an independent

federal regulatory agency charged by Congress with the responsibility for administering and
enforcing the provisions of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1 et seg. (2012), and the Regulations promulgated
thereunder, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1.1 et seg. (2013).

15. Defendant Jay Bruce Grossman is licensed to practice law in Florida, New York,
and the District of Columbia. He maintains a law practice in Fort Lauderdale, Florida under the
law firm name J.B. Grossman, P.A. (âJBGPAâ), and he previously practiced law at
GrossmanGreenberg, LLC (âGrossmanGreenbergâ). Grossman was registered with the CFTC as
an associated person of various firms in the 1980s. He has not been registered with the CFTC in

any capacity since then.

B. Factual Allegations in the Complaint

16. | The Commissionâs Complaint alleges that Grossman, in his capacity as an attorney,
willfully aided and abetted multiple clients in their operation of unlawful precious metals schemes
by crafting the illusion that their schemes were legitimate and complied with the law, when in fact
none of his clients actually sold physical metals or disbursed loans to customers, as they claimed.

These schemes were explicitly made subject to the Commissionâs prosecutorial authority on July

4
Case 0:14-cv-62061-BB Document 32 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2015 Page 5 of 13

16, 2011, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010
(âDodd-Frankâ), Public Law 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376 (2010), which granted the CFTC new
authority to regulate retail commodity transactions âas ifâ they were futures contracts.

17. Specifically, the Complaint alleges that Grossman willfully aided and abetted his
clients Hunter Wise Commodities, LLC (âHW Commoditiesâ), Hunter Wise Credit, LLC (âHW
Creditâ), and Hunter Wise Trading, LLC (âHW Tradingâ) (collectively, âHunter Wiseâ) and
AmeriFirst Management LLC (âAmeriFirstâ), which held themselves out as metals âclearing
firmsâ for their respective networks of metals âdealersâ that solicited the retail public, in engaging
in unlawful off-exchange retail commodity transactions and committing fraud in connection with
those transactions on and after July 16, 2011, and that he is therefore liable for Hunter Wiseâs and
AmeriFirstâs violations of Sections 4(a), 4b, and 6(c)(1) of the Commodity Exchange Act (âActâ),
7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6(a), 6b, and 9(1) (2012), and Regulation 180.1, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 180.1 (2013), pursuant to
Section 13(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13c(a) (2012).

18. The Complaint further alleges that Grossman willfully aided and abetted Lloyds
Commodities, LLC (âLloyds Commoditiesâ), Lloyds Commodities Credit Company, LLC
(âLloyds Creditâ), and Lloyds Services, LLC (âLloyds Servicesâ) (collectively, âLloydsââ), which
acted as an intermediary between Hunter Wise and certain of its metals dealers, in confirming the
execution of and conducting business in the United States for the purpose of accepting orders for,
or otherwise dealing in, unlawful off-exchange retail commodity transactions on and after July 16,
2011, and that he is therefore liable for Lloydsâ violation of Section 4(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
Â§ 6(a), pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13c(a).

19. Finally, the Complaint alleges that Grossman willfully aided and abetted several
Hunter Wise metals dealers that fraudulently solicited the retail public in engaging in unlawful
off-exchange retail commodity transactions on and after July 16, 2011, including Secured Precious

5
Case 0:14-cv-62061-BB Document 32 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2015 Page 6 of 13

Metals International, Inc. (âSPMIââ) and Secured Precious Metals Management, Inc. (ââSPMMâ)
(collectively, âSecured Precious Metalsâ) and Joseph Glenn Commodities LLC (âJGCâ) and
JGCF LLC (âJGCFââ) (collectively, âJoseph Glennâ), and that he is therefore liable for their
violations of Section 4(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6(a), pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Act,
7 U.S.C. Â§ 13c(a).

OF Jurisdiction and Venue

20. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 6c(a) of the Act,
7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(a) (2012), which provides that whenever it shall appear to the Commission that
any person has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a
violation of any provision of the Act or any rule, regulation, or order promulgated thereunder, the
Commission may bring an action in the proper district of the United States against such person to
enjoin such act or practice, or to enforce compliance with the Act, or any rule, regulation or order
thereunder.

21. | Venue properly lies with this Court pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
Â§ 13a-1(e), because Grossman transacted business in this District and certain of the acts and
practices alleged to be in violation of the Act occurred within this District.
THE PARTIES AGREE AND IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT:

IV. PERMANENT INJUNCTION

22. Pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1, Defendant Grossman its
permanently restrained, enjoined, and prohibited from directly or indirectly engaging in any
conduct in violation of Sections 4(a), 4b, and 6(c)(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6(a), 6b, and 9(1)

(2012), and Regulation 180.1, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 180.1 (2014).

Commission as an attorney until such time as he has been reinstated by order of the Commission

the Commission.

A. Restitution

24. | Defendant Grossman shall pay restitution in the amount of SEVEN HUNDRED

and shall have the discretion to determine and recommend to the Court the amount payable to each

Federal Court Orders Florida Attorney Jay Bruce Grossman to Pay a Civil Penalty and
Restitution Totaling $883,000

Grossman Agrees Not to Appear or Practice as an Attorney before the
CFTC

Washington, DC â The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced that Judge Beth Bloom of
the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida entered a Consent Order against Defendant Jay Bruce
Grossman, who practices law in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

The Consent Order requires Grossman to pay a $150,000 civil monetary penalty and restitution of $733,000 in
connection with Grossmanâs aiding and abetting multiple clients in their operation of illegal and fraudulent precious
metals schemes in violation of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) The Order also permanently enjoins Grossman from
committing further violations of the CEA, as charged, and requires Grossman not to appear or practice as an attorney
before the CFTC until such time as he has been reinstated by Order of the CFTC.

The Order arises out of the CFTC Complaint filed on September 9, 2014 (see CFTC Complaint and Press Release 6990-14).
According to the CFTC Complaint, Grossman, in his capacity as an attorney, aided and abetted multiple clients in their
operation of unlawful precious metals schemes by crafting the illusion that their schemes were legitimate and complied
with the law, when in fact they were neither.

The CFTC previously obtained the following judgments against Grossmanâs clients:

* On May 16, 2014, a federal court in Florida found that Grossman client Hunter Wise and its owners committed
ârepeated, callous, and blatantâ fraud in their operation of a precious metals scheme and ordered Hunter Wise and
its owners to pay $52.6 million in restitution to defrauded customers and a $55.4 million civil monetary penalty in
U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission v. Hunter Wise Commodities, LLC, Case No. 9:12-cv-81311-DMM (S.D.
Fla.) (see CFTC Press Release 6935-14, May 22, 2014).

Â¢ On July 24, 2014, a federal court in Florida ordered Grossman client AmeriFirst Management and its owners to
pay $25 million in restitution and a $10 million civil monetary penalty for their operation of a fraudulent precious
metals scheme in U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission v. AmeriFirst Management LLC. Case No. 0:13-cv-
61637-WPD (S.D. Fla.) (see CFTC Press Release 6973-14).

Â¢ In the same action, the court also ordered Grossman clients James Burbage and Frank Gaudino, and their
companies Lloyds Commodities, LLC, Lloyds Commodities Credit Company, LLC, and Lloyds Services, LLC,
to pay restitution totaling over $2 million and civil monetary penalties totaling over $2.9 million for engaging in
unlawful retail off-exchange precious metals transactions (see CFTC Press Release 6850-14).

* Additionally, the CFTC filed and settled charges with two Grossman clients, Secured Precious Metals and
Joseph Glenn Commodities, for engaging in unlawful retail off-exchange precious metals transactions while acting
as metals dealers for Hunter Wise (see CFTC Press Releases 6503-13 and 6542-13).

The CFTC cautions victims that restitution orders may not result in the recovery of money lost because the wrongdoers
may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers and to
ensure that wrongdoers are held accountable.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Stephanie Reinhart, Jennifer E. Smiley, Susan
Gradman, Scott Williamson, and Rosemary Hollinger.

*K OK OK OOK OK OK
CFTCâs Precious Metals Customer Fraud Advisory

The CFTC has issued several customer protection Fraud Advisories that provide the warning signs of fraud, including the
Precious Metals Fraud Advisory, which alerts customers to precious metals fraud and lists simple ways to spot precious
metals scams.

2. Settling Defendants Fraudulently Solicited Customers to Trade Forex
Through Black Diamond

19, From at least April 2007 through at least December 2009 (ârelevant periodâ),
Salazat, Individual 1, Individual 2, and Individual 3, acting through various corporate entities,
fraudulently solicited and/or accepted at least $35 milllon from at least 240 customers for the
purported purpose of trading, via the Black Diamond trading platform, a pooled investment in
connection with agreements, contracts, ot transactions in off-exchange foreign currency
(âforexâ) that are margined or leveraged.

20, At least certain of these customers, if not all, were Individuals who had total
assets of loss than $5 million.

21. Individual | first solicited Salazar to invest in forex through Black Diamond
Capital Solutions, L.L.C. (âBDCS8â) in April 2007, and subsequently entered Into a joint venture
with Salazar whereby she, acting through her company Life Plus, would market forex trading
through BDCS to her customers, Individual 1 and Salazar would then split equally the joint
ventureâs share of profits achieved by any new customers brought to BDCS by Salazar.

22,. Individual 4 and Salazar subsequently solicited Individual 2 to invest in forex
through BDCS in October 2007, and then entered into a three-way joint venture with Individual

2, whereby he, acting through his own corporate entity, would market forex trading through

 
 

1-cv-00023-RJC-DCK Document 112-1 Filed 12/02/14 Page 6 of 22h
1 023-RIC-DCK Document ise Filed 06/24/15 Page 6 of 22

 

 
BDCS to his customers, Individual 1, Salazar, and Individual 2 would then split in equal thirds
the new joint ventureâs share of profits achieved by any new customers brought to BDCS by
Individual 2.

23, According to the joint venture agreement, the joint venture was to be conducted
under the name BDCS; but later Individual 1, Salazar, and Individual 2 changed the name to
Black Diamond Holdings (âBD Holdingsâ), Regardless, Individual 1, Salazar, and Individual 2
continued to use the names BDCS, BD Holdings, and Black Diamond interchangeably in their
forex materials, solicitations, and communications with customers.

24, Â° Individual 1, Salazar, and Individual 2 jointly developed Black Diamond
solloitation materials and provided them to the persons and entities they solicited. The Black
Diamond solicitation materials used by Individual 1, Salazar, and Individual 2 claimed that
Black Diamond offered customers exclusive access to an automatic computerized trading system
oreated by a group of software developers to trade forex, that the system had been trading forex
for over 36 months, and that every month had exceeded the target of four percent gain per
âmonth, One version of the materials purported to show an actual three year trading history with
consistently positive monthly returns, often in excess of ten percent, and a three year balance
reflecting results of $194,340.37 on an initial $5,000 investment,

25, The Black Diamond solicitation materials assured customers that the tisk of
trading forex through Black Diamond was limited because automatic stop loss mechanisms
would kick in should a customerâs account ever drop ten percent (or, in some later versions,
twenty percent) and would prevent any further trading without specific instructions from the

customer, In addition, the materials assured customers that Black Diamond had no ti ight to

Case Silb-cy-00023-RIC-DCK Document i322 Filed 06/24/15 Page 7 abZ2Â¥

 

 
deplete or withdraw customer funds at any time other than for the purpose of erigaging In actual

trading.

 

26.  Toexpand the reach of the Black Diamond scheme even farther, Salazar entered
into âCo-Facilitator Agreementsâ with certain of her customers, These agreements authorized
others, so-called âFacilitators,â to solicit customers to trade forex through BDCS in exchange for
amarketing service fee, Ifa Facilitator successfully solicited a customer to trade through BDCS,
then Individual 1 and Salazar would further divide their portion of the customerâs trading profits i
with the referring Facilitator, As a result of these Co-Facilitator agreements, the Black Diamond
fraudulent scheme was extended to numerous individuals/entities across Callfornia, Colorado,
Texas, and other states,

27, â Inaddition to the Black Diamond solicitation material described above, Salazar,
directly ot through her Facilitators, provided customers with a one-page trading agreement to
sign. The trading agreement provided that customers would participate with both BDCS and
Life Plus in a forex trading account held by BDCS at a third party brokerage, and provided for a
percentage split (usually ranging from 50/50 to 60/40) of net profits between the account holder
and Black Diamond/Life Plus, Salazar signed many, if not most, of these agreements as an
officer of Black Diamond and Life Plus, Many, if not most, of Salazarâs customers also
completed an account information form wherein Salazarâs name appeared on the signature line
as an officer of Black Diamond as well as Life Plus,

3, Settling Defendants Misappropriated Customer Funds

28, The funds of the customers solicited by Salazar for investment with Black

._Diamond were deposited either directly into bank accounts in the name of BDCS controlled by

Individual 1 or into bank accounts in the name of Salazar and/or Life Plus, In the latter case,

Case 3:11-cv-00023-RJC-DCK Document 112-1 Filed 12/02/14 Page 8 of 22 :
Case G1 1-cv-h023-RIC-DCK Document 132 Filed 06/24/15 Page 8 af 2:

 

 

 
Salazat then either wired the funds directly to bank accounts in the name of BDCS controlled by
Individual 1, ov had Individual 1 or agents of Black Diamond create bookkeeping records to
reflect fictitious transfers of funds from Salazarâs Black Diamond trading account to the
customerâs Black Diamond trading account. Funds flowed back from BDCS bank accounts
either directly to Salazarâs customers ot through bank accounts in the name of Salazar and/or
Life Plus.

29, Individual 1 never engaged in any trading of forex on behalf of Black Diamond
customers, In fact, the so-called system developers and the Black Diamond trading platform
never existed, Instead of investing customer finds Into a forex trading platform operated by
Black Diamond as promised, Individual 1 misappropriated those funds to pay purported profits
or to return principal to Black Diamond customers, These payments accounted for at least half
of the money brought in to Black Diamond, or approximately $19 million,

30. Individual also used at least $5.8 million in Black Diamond funds for cash
withdrawals or to finanee personal expenses for such things as teal estate purchases and
improvements, cars and lavish trips, In addition, Individual 1 used at least $2 million of Black
Diamond customer finds to start, advertise, and operate several side businesses, These side
businesses were unrelated to the forex trading purportedly taking place through Black Diamond,

31,  Salazarâs customers invested more than $7 million for the purpose of trading
forex through Black Diamond, Of the more than $2 rnillion Salazar received directly from
customers, Salazar failed to send to Black Diamond approximately $1.5 million. Instead, she
made or caused to be made bookkeeping transactions representing these customer deposits, with
no actual transfer of funds taking place, keeping the aotual funds for her personal use,

Additionally, Salazar received more than $1.9 million in customer funds from Black Diamond,

returned only approximately $600,000 to enstomers, and kept the remalning approximately $1.3
million for her personal use,
32. Salazar used the approximately $2.8 mi{llon in misappropriated Black Diamond
customer funds for, among other things, expensive personal trips and the purchase of more than
$400,000 worth of vehioles,

4, Settling Defendants Concealed Theiy Misappropriation With False Account
Statements and Misvepresentations

' 33, âTo conceal! the lack of trading and the misappropriation of customer funds,
Individual 1 caused to be issued through Salazar and other Black Diamond agents false monthly
account statements to customers consistently showing overwhelmingly positive returns from
their alleged forex trading, In fact, Black Diamond never reported a losing month. Salazar
prepared or reviewed some or all of these account statements before issuing them to her

customers, then delivered, or caused to be delivered, and/or reported the results of such

 

statements to her customers. Relying on the consistently profitable monthly account statements,
Salazarâs existing customers decided to remain invested and, in some cases, invested additional
funds through Salazar. Additionally, prospective customers made the decision to invest in forex
trading through Black Diarnond through Salazar after hearing of the consistently profitable
monthly returns fo existing customers,

34. By satly 2009, Black Diamond and Individual 1 had insufficient funds to continue
paying out customer withdrawal requests. Despite their lack of trading and lack of funds to meet
customer demands, Black Diamond and Individual 1 continued to accept, and Salazar continued
to send, of caused to be sent, on behalf of her customers, additional finds from current customers

as well as funds from new customers in an apparent effort to keep the fraudulent scheme going,

35, On March 19, 2009, Individual 1 sent an email to Salazar stating that Black
Diamond would be shutting down for restructuring and, therefore, would be liquidating all
customer accounts. In the email, Individual 1 also stated that all accounts, including all forex
trading gains, would be paid out. At that point, however, there was only approximately $600,000
remaining in the Black Diamond bank accounts, The alleged plan for restructuring was the first
in a sories of excuses created by Individual 1, which were repeated by â and, in some instances,
crafted with the aid of â Salazar to her customers to explain the failure to return funds to
customers, These excuses included, but were not limited to, claims that: (1) the restructuring of
Black Diamond required several accounting reviews and multiple paymasters and accountants
before funds could be returned; (2) excessive withdrawal requests by customers were causing
delays in the return of funds; (3) a non-existent German liquidity provider by the name of Klaus
was attempting to provide $120 million to Black Diamond to payout customers and replace
Black Diamond on the purported platform, buthis alleged transfer of funds was frozen by bank
or regulatory procedures; (4) other bank interventions, such as banking requirements and
restrictions, caused the Black Diamond accounts to be frozen; and (5) regulatory interventions by
the Federal Reserve, the Treasury Department and the CFTC, for reasons unrelated to the
operations of Black Diamond, purportedly resulted in the freezing of their funds,

36, Even as the excuses propounded by Individual 1 became more complex and
outrageous, Salazar continued to forward these exonses to her customers as if they were her own
or as if she had full knowledge of what was alleged in the excuses, Salazar, for example, made
numerous assurances to her customers that a payout by Black Diamond would ocour, resulting in
a fill return to customers of their principal and interest from their Black Diamond investment, In

fact, Salazar, in an instant message exchange with Individual 1 in July 2009, wotked with

Individual 1 to draft the excuse they would provide to customers regarding the closing of Black

Diamond and the unavailability of funds for withdrawals.

37, Despite the complete lack of trading and more than eight months of delays in
returning the unaecounted-for funds, Salazar still claimed to her customers, through at least
December 2009, that their funds would be returned. Throughout this time, Salazar continued to
issue, or caused to be issued, to her customers monthly account statements through November
2009 showing profitable results from Black Diamondâs alleged forex trading,

5. Settling Defendants Continued to Misappropriate Funds Even Whon They
Knew Black Diamond Could Not Make Customer Payouts

38. Even months after Black Diamond was unable to make any customer payouts,

Salazat continued to accept additional funds for investment in Black Diamond and never sent, or

 

caused to be sent, those funds to Black Diamond for forex trading. Instead, Salazar kept, or
caused to be kept, those funds on deposit in bank accounts and did nat Inform her customers of
this fact. For example, during the summer of 2009, Salazar took in approximately $130,000 in
customer deposits intended for the purpose of trading forex through Black Diamond. âSalazar
never sent these funds to Black Diamond; instead, the funds were used, among other things, to
pay her personal expenses,

6. Salazar Controlled Life Plus and Was Its Agent

39. During the relevant period, Salazar held herself out as the principal of Life Plus
and was described as the owner of Life Plus in various documents and communications, She
controlled the bank accounts opened and maintained in the name of Life Plus, She solicited
customers to invest in Life Plus for the purpose of trading forex through Black Diamond. She
was also responsible for the content of the Life Plus account statements distributed to Life Plus

customers,

Court Orders $76 Million in Civil Monetary Penalties against Keith F. Simmons, Deanna
Salazar and Their Companies in Connection with Foreign Currency Ponzi Scheme

In Related Criminal Actions, Simmons Sentenced to 40 Yearsâ and
Salazar Sentenced to 4.5 Yearsâ Incarceration and Ordered to Pay in
Total $40 Million in Criminal Restitution

Both Simmons and Salazar Currently are Serving Their Prison
Sentences

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced that Judge Robert J.
Conrad, Jr. of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina entered separate Consent Orders (Orders)
against Defendants Keith F. Simmons and his company, Black Diamond Capital Solutions, LLC, and Deanna
Salazar and her companies, Life Plus Group, LLC and Black Diamond Holdings, LLC, imposing a total of $76 million
in civil monetary penalties in connection with a foreign currency exchange (forex) scheme in violation of the Commodity
Exchange Act (CEA). The Orders also impose permanent trading and registration bans on the Defendants and prohibit
them from further violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the CEA, as charged.

Simmons was a resident of West Jefferson, North Carolina, and Salazar was a resident of Yucca Valley, California.

The Orders arise out of a CFTC Complaint, filed on January 13, 2011, charging Simmons, Salazar, and their companies
with fraudulent solicitation and misappropriation of customer funds in connection with a Ponzi-style scheme involving
forex trading (see CFTC Press Release and Complaint 5985-11, February 16, 2011). Also charged in the CFTC complaint
are Bryan Coats of Clayton, North Carolina and his company, Genesis Wealth Management, LLC, and Jonathan
Davey of Newark, Ohio and his companies, Divine Circulation Services, LLC, Divine Stewardship, LLC, Safe
Harbor Ventures, Inc., Safe Harbor Wealth Investments, Inc., and Safe Harbor Wealth, Inc. The CFTCâs litigation
against these Defendants is ongoing.

The Orders find that from at least April 2007 through at least 2009, Simmons and Salazar, acting through their
companies and with others, fraudulently solicited and accepted at least $35 million from at least 240 individuals to
engage in off-exchange forex trading through a trading platform Known as Black Diamond. In fact, according to the
Orders, no forex trading was ever conducted through the Black Diamond trading platform, and the Black Diamond trading
platform never existed. Rather, Simmons and Salazar misappropriated millions of dollars of customer funds to make
purported profit payments to customers, as is typical of a Ponzi scheme, and for personal and unrelated business
expenses, according to the Orders. The Orders further find that to conceal their fraud, Simmons, with the assistance of
Salazar, issued false customer account statements reflecting the promised returns or more based on Black Diamondâs
purportedly successful forex trading.

In a related criminal action brought by the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Western District of North Carolina, Simmons was
convicted on December 16, 2010, on charges of securities fraud, wire fraud, and money laundering. Simmons was
sentenced to 40 yearsâ incarceration and ordered to pay criminal restitution of $35 million. On December 7, 2010, Salazar
pleaded guilty to charges of investment fraud conspiracy and tax evasion. Salazar was sentenced to 4.5 yearsâ
incarceration and ordered to pay $5 million in criminal restitution. Both Simmons and Salazar are still serving their
sentences.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Alan Edelman, Maura Viehmeyer, James H. Holl
lll, Gretchen L. Lowe, and Rick Glaser. The Division would like to thank the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Western District
of North Carolina and the Federal Bureau of Investigation for their cooperation in this matter.

SEALED ORDER GRANTING COMMISSIONâS EX PARTE STATUTORY
RESTRAINING ORDER

Plaintiff, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ), has filed a
Complaint for Permanent Injunction and Other Relief, and has moved, pursuant to Section
6c(a) of the Commodity Exchange Act (the âActâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(a) (2012) and Federal
Rule of Civil Procedure (âFed. R. Civ. P.â) 65(b), for an in camera, ex parte statutory
restraining order enjoining Defendants Dinar Corp, Inc. (âDCTâ), My Monex, Inc., a Nevada
corporation (âMonex NVâ) and Husam Tayeh (âTayehâ) (collectively the âDefendantsâ) and
Relief Defendants Theodore S. Hudson, II (âHudsonâ) and My Monex, Inc., an Alabama
corporation (âMonex ALâ) (collectively the âRelief Defendantsâ), from destroying, altering,
or disposing of, or refusing to permit authorized representatives of the Commission to inspect

and copy any books or records or other documents, including electronically stored
Case 1:15-cv-00538-WKW-TFM Document 8 Filed 07/27/15 Page 2 of 11

information (âESIâ), and further enjoining Defendants and Relief Defendants from
withdrawing, transferring, removing, dissipating, or disposing of any funds, assets or other
property. The Court has considered the pleadings, declarations, exhibits, and memorandum
filed in support of the Commissionâs motion for a statutory restraining order, and finds that:

l. This Court has jurisdiction over the parties and over the subject matter of this
action pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2012), and Section 2(c)(2) of the
Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(c)(2) (2012).

2. Venue lies properly within this District pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act, 7
U.S.C. 13a-1(e) (2012) in that the acts or practices described in the Complaint took place
and/or are taking place within this District.

3. There is good cause to believe that Defendants have engaged in, are engaging
in and are about to engage in certain unlawful conduct, including, but not limited to: a
fraudulent scheme involving the offering of agreements, contracts or transactions in off-
exchange foreign currency (âforexâ) on a leveraged, margined, or financed basis, totaling
more than $27 million, to retail customers who were not eligible contract customers (âECPsâ)
and that do not result in actual delivery of forex within two (2) days of the transaction date(s);
the failure of DCI and Monex NV to register with the Commission as registered foreign
exchange dealers (âRFEDâ); and the failure of Tayeh to register with the Commission as an
associated person (âAPâ) of the RFEDs DCI and/or Monex NV, in connection with financed
retail forex transactions as described in Section 2(c)(2)(C)(i) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
Â§ 2(c)(2)(C)(i) (which are subject to the anti-fraud provisions of Section 4b(a)(2)(A) and (C)
of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6b(a)(2)(A), (C), pursuant to Sections 2(c)(2)(C)Gi)() and

2(c)(2)(C)(iv) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 2(c)(2)(C)(ii)(), 2(c)(2)(C)(iv)), in violation of Sections
Case 1:15-cv-00538-WKW-TFM Document 8 Filed 07/27/15 Page 3of11

2(c)(2)(C)(iii)(1)(aa), and 4b(a)(2)(A), (C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 2(c)(2)(C)Gii)()(aa) and
6b(a)(2)(A), (C) (2012), and Commission Regulation 5.3(a)(6)(i) and (ii), 17 C.F.R.
Â§5.3(a)(6)(i) and (ii) (2014). In addition, there is good cause to believe that some of the
Defendantsâ customersâ funds have been and/or are currently held in one or more accounts in
the name of, or under the control of, Relief Defendants, who have no legitimate interest in or
entitlement to these funds received as a result of Defendantsâ unlawful conduct.

4. There is good cause to believe that immediate and irreparable damage to the
Courtâs ability to grant effective final relief for customers in the form of monetary redress will
occur from the sale, transfer, assignment, or other disposition by Defendants and/or Relief
Defendants of assets or records unless Defendants and Relief Defendants are immediately
restrained and enjoined by Order of the Court.

5. There is good cause for the Court to impose a restraining order prohibiting
Defendants and Relief Defendants and their agents, servants, employees, attorneys, and other
persons who are in active concert or participation with them, from withdrawing, transferring,
removing, dissipating, or disposing of any funds, assets, or other property owned, controlled,
managed, or held by or on behalf of, or for the benefit of Defendants and/or Relief
Defendants.

6. There is good cause for entry of an order prohibiting Defendants and Relief
Defendants, and their agents, servants, employees, assigns, attorneys, and persons in active
concert or participation with the Defendants and/or Relief Defendants, including any
successor thereof, from destroying records and/or denying agents of the Commission access to
inspect and copy records to ensure that Commission representatives have immediate and

complete access to all such books and records.
Case 1:15-cv-00538-WKW-TFM Document 8 Filed 07/27/15 Page 4 of11

7, Absent the entry of this statutory restraining order, the Defendants and Relief
Defendants are likely to dissipate or transfer assets and destroy business records.

8. This is a proper case for granting an ex parte statutory restraining order to
preserve the status quo, protect public customers from loss and damage, and enable the
Commission to fulfill its statutory duties, therefore the Court orders as follows:

DEFINITIONS

CFTC Charges Illinois Resident Husam Tayeh, Dinar Corp., Inc., and My Monex, Inc. with
Fraud and Other Violations Involving Foreign Currency Scheme

Federal Court Issues Emergency Order Freezing Assets and Protecting
Books and Records

Washington, DC â The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced the unsealing of a civil
enforcement action filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama, charging Husam Tayeh of Oak
Lawn, Illinois; Dinar Corp., Inc. (DCI), a Nevada corporation; and My Monex, Inc. (Monex NV), a Nevada corporation
(collectively, the Defendants), with operating a fraudulent scheme involving foreign currency (forex), and failing to
register with the CFTC as required by federal law. The CFTC Complaint further names Theodore S. Hudson, II and his
company My Monex, Inc., an Alabama corporation (Monex AL), both of Dothan, Alabama, as Relief Defendants.

The CFTC Complaint was filed under seal on July 27, 2015, and that same date U.S. District Judge Myron H. Thompson
issued an emergency Order freezing and preserving assets under Defendantsâ and Relief Defendantsâ control and
prohibiting them from destroying documents or denying CFTC staff access to their books and records. The Court
scheduled a hearing for August 10, 2015, on the CFTCâs separate motion for a preliminary injunction.

The Complaint alleges that beginning from at least January 2012 and continuing to the present (the relevant period),
Tayeh, DCI, and Monex NV engaged, and are engaging, in a fraudulent scheme involving the offering of agreements,
contracts or transactions in off-exchange forex on a leveraged, margined, or financed basis to retail customers who were
not eligible contract participants (ECPs) and that do not result in actual delivery of forex within two (2) days of the
transaction date(s). Defendants, who have never been registered as required with the CFTC, have engaged in more than
$8 million of these illegal, off-exchange retail forex transactions.

Tayeh created and operates DCI and Monex NV, business entities that he uses to facilitate the Defendantsâ fraudulent
activities and that act as the counterparty(s) in the subject agreements, contracts or transactions in forex. Defendants
operate their fraudulent scheme via the Internet through the use of their website, by offering, and entering into,
transactions in forex with non-ECP retail customers that are leveraged, margined or financed by the Defendants, and that
result in actual delivery of forex - if at all - within periods of not less than 15 days and as much as 120 days following the
date of the transaction(s).

The Complaint further alleges that in furtherance of the fraudulent scheme, Tayeh, individually and on behalf of DCI and
Monex NV, made, and continues to make, material misrepresentations and omit material facts in solicitations to actual
and prospective customers via the website, including but not limited to: (1) representing that DCI operates a âfully
licensed and fully compliant licensed money services businessâ but failing to disclose that DCI has been served with
cease and desist orders in the states of Texas and Illinois for operating without required licenses; (2) representing that
DCI and Monex NV provide the âbest price guaranteedâ and the âbest prices up front all the timeâ but failing to disclose
that the forex transactions they offer to retail customers include significant finance charges; (3) failing to disclose that
DCI and Monex NV are each operating as a registered foreign exchange dealer (RFED) without being registered with the
Commission as required; and (4) failing to disclose that Tayeh is acting as an associated person (AP) of an RFED(s)
without being registered with the CFTC as required. Relief Defendants Hudson and Monex are alleged to have accepted
funds from the Defendants to which they have no legitimate claim.

In its continuing litigation, the CFTC seeks restitution to defrauded customers, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, a civil
monetary penalty, permanent registration and trading bans, and a permanent injunction against future violations of
federal commodities laws, as charged.

The CFTC appreciates the assistance of the Office of the United States Attorney for the Middle District of Alabama, the
Alabama Securities Commission, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Dothan Alabama Police Department, and the
Houston County Alabama Sheriff's Office.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this action are Timothy J. Mulreany, JonMarc P. Buffa, Kyong
J. Koh, Patricia A. Gomersall, Joanna M. Lara, Tashieka Taylor, and Paul G. Hayeck, as well as Jeremy Christianson from
the Office of Data and Technology.

AND OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF

1
INTRODUCTION

On April 18, 2014, Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ or
âCFTCâ) filed a Complaint (âComplaintâ) against Defendants Brunswick Capital LLC
(âBCLLCâ), Brunswick Capital Partners LP (ââBCLPâ) and Wayne P. Weddington III
(collectively âDefendantsâ) seeking injunctive and other equitable relief, as well as the

U.S.C, Â§Â§ 1 et seq. (2012), and the Commissionâs Regulations (âRegulationsâ) promulgated
thereunder, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1.1 et seq. (2014). Specifically, the CFTCâs Complaint alleged that
Defendants violated Sections 4b(a)(1)(A) and (C) and 40(1)(A) and (B), 7 U.S.C. Â§8 6b(a)(1)(A)

and (C) and 60(1)(A) and (8), and Commission Regulation 4.41(b), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 4.41(b) (2014),

THE PARTIES AGREE AND THE COURT HEREBY FINDS:
A. FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Parties

14. Plaintiff Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an independent federal
regulatory agency that is charged by Congress with administering and enforcing the Act, 7
USC. Â§Â§ 1 et seq., and the Regulations promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1.1 et seq.

15. Brunswick Capital LLC is a Connecticut limited liability corporation with its
principal place of business in New Canaan, Connecticut. Weddington became BCLLCâs
managing member and BCLLC served as the CPO for the Pennoyer Fund. BCLLC has never
been registered with the Commission in any capacity.

16. Brunswick Capital Partners LP is a Delaware limited partnership with its principal
place of business in New York, New York. Weddington formed BCLP in 2007. Weddington
became BCLPâs managing partner and president and BCLP served as the advisor to the Pennoyer
Fund. From its inception until October 2011, BCLP was not registered with the Commission.
BCLP became registered with the Commission as a CTA in October 2011 and is currently
registered in that capacity,

17. Wayne Pennoyer Weddington III is a resident of New York, New York.

Weddington is BCLLCâs managing member. Weddington also formed BCLP and is its

SMRH:204222830.1 -5-

 

 
 

managing partner and president. Weddington was not registered with the Commission until
January 2012, Weddington became registered with the Commission as an associated person
(âAPâ) of BCLP and is currently registered in that capacity.

2. Defendantsâ False Exemption and Unregistered CTA Activity

18. Defendants formed the Pennoyer Fund in approximately 2007, and installed
BCLLC as the fundâs CPO and BCLP as the fundâs advisor. Weddington served as BCLLCâs
managing member and BCLPâs general partner and president. Defendants were entitled to
compensation from the Pennoyer Fund in the form of management or incentive fees. BCLP, by
and through Weddington, solicited investments from numerous prospective pool participants.
BCLP, by and through Weddington, also distributed promotional materials containing purported
profits generated from successful commodity trading to the public and prospective pool
participants.

19, Between October and December 2008, the Defendants solicited and accepted
approximately $1.35 million from outside investors for interests in the pool, which ultimately
traded E-mini S&P 500 futures contracts and other e-mini index products offered on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, Inc. (âCMEâ),

20. CPOs and CTAs must electronically file with NFA all notices of exclusion or
exemption from the Commissionâs registration requirements.

21. In October 2008, before commencing trading in the pool, Weddington, on behalf
of BCLLC, filed a notice of exemption under Commission Regulation 4.13(a)(4), 17 C.F.R. Â§
4,13(a)(4), for BCLLC to operate as an exempt CPO.

22. At the same time, Weddington, on behalf of BCLP, filed a notice of exemption
under Commission Regulation 4.14(a)(8) for BCLP to act as an exempt CTA to advise and trade

the Pennoyer Fund without benefit of Commission registration, Commission Regulation

SMRH:204222830.1 -6-

 
 

4.14(a)(8), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 4.14(a)(8), provides that a person is not required to register as a CTA if
(1) the advisor is already registered as an investment adviser under the IAA, registered with a
state securities regulatory agency, or excluded from the definition of an IAA; and, (2) the
commodity trading advice given is solely incidental to the advisorâs business of providing
securities or other investment advice.

23. The notice of exemption Defendants Weddington and BCLP filed for BCLP
under Regulation 4.14 was inaccurate for two reasons, First, neither BCLP nor Weddington was
registered under the IAA during the relevant period, nor were they excluded from the definition
of the term IAA. Second, Defendantsâ commodity trading advice was not solely incidental to
providing securities or other investment advice to the Pennoyer Fund,

24, Defendantsâ filing of an inaccurate notice of exemption was willful. Weddington
and BCLP knew that they were not registered under the IAA because they never sought such
registration, Further, Weddington and BCLP knew that the commodity trading advice BCLP
provided was not merely incidental to the operation of the Pennoyer Fund because Weddington
and BCLP opened and funded the Pennoyer Fundâs futures trading accounts and because the
$1.35 million Defendants traded in E-mini S&P 500 futures contracts from October 2008
through July 2009 made up the overwhelming majority of the funds in the Pennoyer Fund.

25. The exemption claimed by Weddington and BCLP remained inaccurate until
BCLP registered with the Commission as a CTA in October 2011, and Weddington became
registered as an AP of BCLP in January 2012.

26. BCLP acted as a CTA and Weddington acted as an associated person of a CTA
throughout the relevant period by soliciting funds from participants and prospective participants

to trade in E-mini S&P 500 futures contracts in the Pennoyer Fund, and advised others directly

SMRH:204222830.1 -7-

 
 

or indirectly or through publications, writings or electronic media as to the value or the
advisability of trading in commodity futures or options contracts.

3. Defendantsâ Fraudulent Solicitation of Pool Participant Funds and Falsified
Trading Results

27. â By July 2009, the Pennoyer Fund had lost approximately 30% of its value
through, among other things, trading losses. Defendants returned some of the remaining funds to
some of the pool participants.

28. In December 2008, Participant A, a 62 year old resident of Willow, New York,
wired $250,000 to a Pennoyer Fund account that Weddington controlled. By December 31,
2010, due to market losses from Defendantsâ trading, Participant Aâs investment had been
reduced to $190, 837.

29. For several months between January 2010 to December 2010, Defendants issued
or caused to be issued via email to Participant A false monthly statements that misrepresented
the fundâs profits and losses.

30. | Weddington led Participant A to believe that he had the ability to redeem her
funds and led her to believe that her funds were safe and secure by, among other statements,
assuring her in the same e-mail that, in response a specific question she posed, her funds were
not directly exposed to markets and an annual dividend of not less than 4% would be paid to her.
Weddington engaged in this type of communication with Participant A until at least March 2014,
when he sent her an e-mail offering her a promissory note in which he would not return her funds
to her until 2017.

31. Participant A requested return of her funds from Defendants in approximately
July 2012. From that time until at least March 2014, in a series of e-mails and telephone calls,

Weddington repeatedly told Participant A that he would return her funds but never did so.

SMRH:204222830.1 ~8-
 

32. Further, after July 2009, Defendants solicited new fund participants and
prospective participants via email, telephone and other means or instrumentalities of interstate
commerce. In the course of soliciting these new participants and prospective participants,
Defendants made material misrepresentations, omitted material facts and engaged in deceptive
acts and practices in attempts to defraud the participants and prospective participants. For
example, Defendants created false performance and financial records and promotional material
that they used from at least February 2010 to July 2011, in which they falsely claimed that an
algorithmic trading system Weddington had developed called âSysMacroâ to trade E-mini S&P
500 futures contracts made profits nearly every month and over 30% in one year.

33. Additionally, some of the trading Defendants used to create the false performance
records purportedly took place in a hypothetical trading account. Defendants failed to disclose to
new participants or prospective participants that some of the trading results contained in the
performance records were hypothetical and instead presented the results in promotional and
marketing material as actual trading results.

34, Defendants hired marketing managers to assist soliciting the new participants and
prospective participants, and provided the marketing managers with promotional! material
containing false performance records.. Defendants intended that the marketing managers use the
false performance records and false promotional material to solicit prospective participants and
knew or recklessly disregarded that the marketing managers were presenting false and
misleading promotional! material to prospective participants,

35. â_In or about October 2010, Defendants solicited and obtained approximately

$500,000 from a participant to trade in the Pennoyer Fund. Defendants lost at least $30,000 of

the participantâs funds within two to three months. Defendants, knowing these losses occurred,

SMRH:204222830.1 -9-

 
 

continued to claim to prospective participants that their trading of the Pennoyer Fund was
profitable.

36. In or about March 2011, utilizing email, telephone or other instrumentalities of
interstate commerce, Defendants set up and attended meetings with a major financial services
company in attempts to obtain trading funds, Defendants used the false performance records and
undisclosed purported hypothetical trading results to solicit the financial services company.
Further, Defendants falsely inflated the Pennoyer Fundâs assets in a financial prospectus they
provided to the financial services company, claiming that the Pennoyer Fund had between one
and three million dollars in assets under management, when, in fact, the Pennoyer Fund at that
time had approximately $270,000.

37. Inor about August 2011, Defendants, through their marketing managers, solicited
and obtained approximately $1,000,000 from another participant which was sent by bank wire,
an instrumentality of interstate commerce. Shortly thereafter, Defendants had to return the funds
to the participant when the participant learned that Defendants did not have the trading success
represented in their promotional materials.

38. During the relevant period, Weddington at all times controlled and acted on
behalf of BCLLC, BCLP and the Pennoyer Fund. For example, Weddington opened and signed
on behalf of both BCLLC and BCLP all of the account agreements necessary to open and trade
the Pennoyer Fund futures accounts, signed corporate documents assigning BCLLC and BCLP
as the Pennoyer Fundâs operator and advisor. Weddington also created the false Pennoyer Fund
performance records and the false promotional materials, and hired the marketing managers and
armed them with the false promotional materials to solicit participants and prospective

participants.

SMRH:204222830.1 -10-

 
 

39. | Weddingtonâs primary professional activity still involves financial consulting and

acting as a private equity advisor/financing.

New York Federal Court Orders New York Financial Advisor Wayne P. Weddington III and
His Companies to Pay More than $1 Million for Commodity Pool Fraud and Unregistered
Activity

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) announced that Judge Colleen McMahon of
the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a Consent Order of permanent injunction against
Defendants Wayne P. Weddington III of New York, New York and his companies â Brunswick Capital LLC of New
Canaan, Connecticut, and Brunswick Capital Partners LP, a Delaware corporation licensed to do business in New York.

The Order, entered on August 4, 2015, requires the Defendants jointly to pay a $650,000 civil monetary penalty and
restitution of $375,039 to defrauded customers. The Order also imposes a permanent trading and registration ban on the
Defendants and prohibits them from further violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act, as
charged.

The Order stems from a CFTC Complaint filed April 18, 2014 (see Press Release and Complaint 6913-14), and an
Amended Complaint filed in December 2014, which together charged the Defendants with solicitation fraud,
misappropriating customer funds, making false statements, and acting in unregistered capacities in connection with
operating a commodity pool and a proprietary quantitative algorithm developed by the Defendants to trade E-mini S&P
500 futures contracts and other index futures.

According to the Order, 1) Defendants solicited and accepted approximately $1.35 million from pool participants, and
filed a false commodity trading advisor exemption to trade the fund, 2) issued false statements and misappropriated a
portion of the pool participantsâ funds, 3) created false financial and trading records that purported to show that the
quantitative algorithmic trading system generated monthly trading profits, when in fact, the system lost money virtually
every month, and then 4) hired marketers to solicit funds from hedge funds and other institutional investors using the
false trading results.

The CFTC cautions victims that restitution orders may not result in the recovery of money lost because the wrongdoers
may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers and to

ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTIONS 6(c) AND 6(d) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, MAKING
FINDINGS AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

I,

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ) has reason to believe that
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC (âMorgan Stanleyâ or âRespondentâ) violated Commission
Regulations 22.9 and 166.3. Therefore, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public
interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted to determine
whether Respondent engaged in the violations set forth herein and to determine whether any
order should be issued imposing remedial sanctions.

IT.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Respondent has
submitted an Offer of Settlement (âOfferâ), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Without admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, Respondent consents to
the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 6(c) and 6(d) of the
Commodity Exchange Act, Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (âOrderâ) and
acknowledges service of this Order.!

 

' Respondent consents to the entry of this Order and to the use of these findings in this proceeding and in
any other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party; provided,
however, that Respondent does not consent to the use of the Offer, or the findings or conclusions in this
Order consented to in the Offer, as the sole basis for any other proceeding brought by the Commission,
other than in a proceeding in bankruptcy or to enforce the terms of this Order. Nor does Respondent
consent to the use of the Offer or this Order, or the findings or conclusions in this Order consented to in
the Offer, by any other party in any other proceeding.
Il.
The Commission finds the following:
A. SUMMARY

On numerous days from March 12, 2013 to March 7, 2014, Morgan Stanley failed to hold
sufficient US Dollars in segregated accounts in the United States on behalf of cleared swaps
customers to meet all US Dollar obligations to those customers, as specified in Regulations
1.49(b)(1) and (e), in violation of Regulation 22.9(a). During a longer period, from November 8,
2012 to on or about April 8, 2014, Morgan Stanley did not have in place adequate procedures to
ensure that it complied with Regulation 22.9(a), in violation of Regulation 166.3.

B. RESPONDENT

Morgan Stanley is a financial services firm, organized under the laws of Delaware, which
is registered with the Commission as an FCM, provisionally registered with the Commission as a
swap dealer, and registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission as a broker-dealer.
Morgan Stanleyâs principal office is in New York, New York. Among other things, Morgan
Stanley executes and clears customer transactions in commodity futures, swaps, stocks, and
options in the United States and worldwide.

C. FACTS

From March 12, 2013 to March 7, 2014, on numerous days, Morgan Stanley failed to
hold sufficient US Dollars in segregated accounts in the United States to meet all of its US
Dollar obligations to cleared swaps customers. On those dates, Morgan Stanley held the amount
of the US Dollar deficits in Euros and other currencies, rather than in US Dollars, when its
cleared swaps customers did not deposit such funds in or request conversion to those currencies,
and when funds did not accrue to the customers in those currencies as a result of cleared swaps
carried through Morgan Stanley, to the extent of such accruals. The size of Morgan Stanleyâs
US Dollar deficits ranged from approximately $5 million to approximately $265 million, at times
representing more than ten percent of the amount that the firm was obligated to maintain in US
Dollars for cleared swaps customers. Because Morgan Stanley held the amount of the US Dollar
deficits in Euros and other currencies, it did not have a shortfall in overall cleared swaps
customer collateral. Nonetheless, on the days at issue, Morgan Stanley did not maintain
sufficient US Dollars in segregation to meet its US Dollar obligations to cleared swaps
customers, in violation of Regulation 22.9(a).

From November 8, 2012 to on or about April 8, 2014, Morgan Stanley did not have in
place adequate procedures to comply with the currency denomination requirements for holding
cleared swaps customer collateral as required by Regulation 22.9(a), and Morgan Stanley did not
train and supervise its personnel to ensure compliance with Regulation 22.9(a). On or about
April 8, 2014, Morgan Stanley learned of its failure to comply with Regulation 22.9(a) from a
routine financial examination conducted by the Financial and Regulatory Surveillance
Department of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (âCMEâ). Morgan Stanley promptly
investigated the deficiencies and implemented procedures to ensure that it would maintain
sufficient US Dollars to satisfy its requirements for holding cleared swaps customer collateral.

2
Morgan Stanley also promptly reported the deficiencies to the Commission and cooperated with
the Division of Enforcement in its investigation relating to this proceeding.

IV.
LEGAL DISCUSSION
A. Failure to Maintain Sufficient US Dollars for Cleared Swaps Obligations

In relevant part, Regulation 22.9(a) provides, subject to Regulation 22.9(b), that FCMs
âmay hold Cleared Swaps Customer Collateral in the denominations, at the locations and
depositories, and subject to the segregation requirements specified in [Regulation 1.49].â 17

C.F.R. Â§ 22.9(a).?

Regulation 1.49(b)(1) provides that âa [FCMâs] obligations to a customer shall be
denominated: (i) [iJn the United States dollar; (ii) [i]n a currency in which funds were deposited
by the customer or were converted at the request of the customer, to the extent of such deposits
and conversions; or (iii) [i]n a currency in which funds have accrued to the customer as a result
of trading conducted on a designated contract market, to the extent of such accruals.â See also
Regulation 22.9(b) (providing that ââa [FCMâs] obligations to a Cleared Swaps Customer may be
denominated in a currency in which funds have accrued to the Cleared Swaps Customer as a
result of a Cleared Swap carried through such [FCM], to the extent of such accrualsâ).

Additionally, Regulation 1.49(e) provides that an FCM âmust, as of the close of each
business day, hold in segregated accounts... [s]ufficient United States dollars, held in the
United States, to meet all United States dollar obligations.â 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.49(e)(1)().

Morgan Stanleyâs US Dollar deficits on the numerous days at issue represented US
Dollar obligations to the firmâs cleared swaps customers that were improperly maintained in
non-US Dollar currencies. As of the close of business on each of those days, Morgan Stanley
did not hold sufficient US Dollars in segregated accounts in the United States to meet all of its
US Dollar obligations to its cleared swaps customers. By holding portions of its US Dollar
obligations in other currencies, Morgan Stanley failed to comply with these requirements of
Regulation 1.49. See In the Matter of Interactive Brokers LLC, CFTC Docket No. 13-19 (Apr. 9,
2013) (finding that FCM violated Regulation 1.49(b) and (e) by holding portions of its US Dollar
obligations to futures customer in other currencies, even when the firm had sufficient excess
segregated funds overall). Respondent thereby violated Regulation 22.9(a), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 22.9(a).

B. Failure to Diligently Supervise
Commission Regulation 166.3, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 166.3, requires that â
Each Commission registrant, except an associated person who has no

supervisory duties, must diligently supervise the handling by its partners,
officers, employees and agents (or persons occupying a similar status or

 

* Regulation 22.9 became effective April 9, 2012, and all parties were required to comply by
November 8, 2012. See Protection of Cleared Swaps Customer Contracts and Collateral, 77 Fed.
Reg. 6,336 (Feb. 7, 2012) (codified at 17 C.F.R. pt. 22).

performing a similar function) of all commodity interest accounts carried,
operated, advised or introduced by the registrant and all other activities of
its partners, officers, employees and agents (or persons occupying a
similar status or performing a similar function) relating to its business as a
Commission registrant.

A violation under Regulation 166.3 is an independent violation for which no underlying violation
is necessary. See In re Collins, [1996-1998 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH)
q 27,194 at 45,744 (CFTC Dec. 10, 1997).

A violation of Regulation 166.3 is demonstrated by showing either that (1) the
registrantâs supervisory system was generally inadequate; or (2) the registrant failed to perform
its supervisory duties diligently. In re Murlas Commodities, (1994-1996 Transfer Binder]
Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) Â¥ 26,485 at 43,161 (CFTC Sept. 1, 1995); In re GNP Commodities,

166.3 can still be violated if the supervisory system is not diligently administered), aff'd sub

1992 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) { 25,266 at 38,850 (CFTC Apr. 1, 1992)
(âThe focus of any proceeding to determine whether Rule 166.3 has been violated will be on
whether [a] review [has] occurred and, if it did, whether it was diligent.â); Samson Refining Co.
v. Drexel Burnham Lambert, Inc. [1987-1990 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH)

{ 24,596 at 36,566 (CFTC Feb. 16 1990) (noting that, under Regulation 166.3, an FCM has a
âduty to develop procedures for the detection and deterrence of possible wrongdoing by its
agentsâ) (internal quotation omitted). Evidence of violations that âshould be detected by a
diligent system of supervision, either because of the nature of the violations or because the
violations have occurred repeatedly,â is probative of a failure to supervise. Jn re Paragon
Futures, J 25,266 at 38,850. See in the Matter of Interactive Brokers LLC, CFTC Docket No.
13-19 (Apr. 9, 2013) (finding that firm violated Regulation 166.3 by failing to have procedures
in place to ensure compliance with, among other provisions, the currency denomination
requirements for customer protection under Regulation 1.49).

Throughout the period from November 8, 2012 (the compliance date for the cleared
swaps customer collateral rules) to at least April 8, 2014 (when the violations of Regulation
22.9(a) were discovered), Morgan Stanley did not have procedures in place to ensure compliance
with Regulation 22.9(a), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 22.9(a), and the firm did not train and supervise its
personnel to ensure compliance with this rule. Morgan Stanley thereby failed to supervise
diligently its officers, employees, and agents and did not have sufficient procedures in place to
detect and deter the violations of the Regulations found herein, in violation of Regulation 166.3,
17 C.F.R. Â§ 166.3.

FINDINGS OF VIOLATIONS

CFTC Orders Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC to Pay a $300,000 Civil Monetary Penalty for
Violations of Customer Protection Rule for Cleared Swaps and Related Supervision Failures

Order Finds that the Firm Failed to Maintain Sufficient U.S. Dollars in
Segregated Accounts in the United States, Holding Required Funds
Instead in Other Currencies

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today issued an Order requiring Morgan
Stanley & Co. LLC (Morgan Stanley), a registered Futures Commission Merchant and provisionally registered swap
dealer, to pay a $300,000 civil monetary penalty for failing to hold sufficient U.S. Dollars in segregated accounts in the
United States to meet all of its U.S. Dollar obligations to cleared swaps customers. The Order also finds that the firm
failed to implement adequate procedures and requires Morgan Stanley to cease and desist from violating CFTC
Regulations, as charged.

Aitan Goelman, the CFTCâs Director of Enforcement, commented: âSince passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform
and Consumer Protection Act, the CFTC has implemented rules to protect swaps customers and market participants,
including rules for protection of cleared swaps customer collateral. This action demonstrates that the Division of
Enforcement will investigate and pursue violations of these important rules of the road in the swaps market.â

As set forth in the Order, on numerous days from March 12, 2013 to March 7, 2014, Morgan Stanley failed to hold
sufficient U.S. Dollars in segregated accounts in the United States to meet all U.S. Dollar obligations to the firmâs cleared
swaps customers, in violation of CFTC Regulation 22.9. On those days, Morgan Stanley held the amount of the U.S. Dollar
deficits in Euros and other currencies, rather than in U.S. Dollars, according to the Order. Because Morgan Stanley held
the amount of the U.S. Dollar deficits in other currencies, it did not have a shortfall in overall cleared swaps customer
collateral. As the Order finds, however, the size of Morgan Stanleyâs U.S. Dollar deficits ranged from approximately $5
million to approximately $265 million, at times representing more than 10 percent of the amount that the firm was
obligated to maintain in U.S. Dollars for cleared swaps customers.

Additionally, the Order finds that from November 8, 2012 to on or about April 8, 2014, Morgan Stanley did not have in
place adequate procedures to comply with the currency denomination requirements for cleared swaps customer
collateral and did not train and supervise its personnel to ensure compliance with CFTC Regulation 22.9. Morgan Stanley
thereby failed to supervise diligently its officers, employees, and agents and did not have sufficient procedures in place
to detect and deter the violations found herein, in violation of Regulation 166.3, the Order finds.

The Order recognizes that Morgan Stanley promptly reported the deficiencies to the CFTC, implemented corrective
procedures, and cooperated with the CFTCâs Division of Enforcement in its investigation.

The CFTC appreciates the assistance of the Division of Swap Dealer and Intermediary Oversight.

The CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Elizabeth C. Brennan, Douglas K. Yatter,
Lenel Hickson, Jr., and Manal M. Sultan.

COMMISSION,

Plaintiff, COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE
AND OTHER EQUITABLE

V. PENALTIES PURSUANT TO THE
COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT

GARY CREAGH, and
WALL STREET PIRATE MANAGEMENT, LLC,

Defendants.

 

 

Plaintiff U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ) alleges as

follows:

I. SUMMARY

l. From at least December 2011 through September 2013 (the ârelevant periodââ),
Wall Street Pirate Management, LLC (ââWSPMâ), by and through its managing member and sole
employee Gary Creagh (âCreaghââ) (collectively the âDefendantsââ), made multiple false
statements to the National Futures Association (the âNFAâ), the self-regulatory organization for
the U.S. futures industry, in statutorily required reports and during an NFA audit of WSPM in
furtherance of NFAâs official duties under the Commodity Exchange Act (the âActâ), 7 U.S.C. -
Â§Â§ 1-23 (2012).

2. Creagh, individually and as the agent of WSPM, falsely represented to the NFA
that the Wall Street Pirate Fund, L.P. (the âWSPFâ or âWSPF commodity poolâ), a commodity
pool WSPM operated, was not active during calendar year 2012 despite that WSPM accepted

funds from participants in the WSPF commodity pool and actively traded commodity futures

RELIEF AND CIVIL MONETARY â
Case 1:15-cv-06140 Documenti1 Filed 08/05/15 Page 2 of 24

contracts for the benefit of the WSPF commodity pool at an account in the poolâs name at futures
commission merchant (the âFCMâ) Interactive Brokers (the âPool Trading Accountâ) throughout
2012. As the sole person authorized to trade on behalf of WSPM, and the sole person who made
hundreds of trades as the agent of WSPM, Creagh knew he personally and actively traded the
Pool Trading Account on behalf of pool participants during the relevant period and knew his
statements to the NFA were false.

3. Defendantsâ actions violated Section 9(a)(4) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13(a)(4).
(2012), which makes it illegal for any person willfully to falsify, conceal, or cover up by any
trick, scheme, or artifice a material fact in communications with the NFA.

4, Additionally, throughout the relevant period, WSPM, by and through its agent
Creagh, failed to maintain required books and records and provide account statements and
privacy notices to WSPF pool participants, in violation of Section 4n(3)(A) and (4) of the Act, 7
U.S.C. Â§ 6n(3)(A), (4) (2012); Commission Regulation 1.31, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.31 (2012) (with
respect to conduct before January 2, 2013); Commission Regulation 1.31, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.31
(2012) (as amended by Adaptation of Regulations to Incorporate Swaps, 7 Fed. Reg. 66288,
66323 (Nov. 2, 2012)) (with respect to conduct on or after January 2, 2013 and before February
19, 2013); Commission Regulation 1.31, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.31 (2014) (with respect to conduct on or
after February 19, 2013); Commission Regulation 4.22, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 4.22 (2012) (with respect to
conduct before November 5, 2012); Commission Regulation 4.22, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 4.22 (2014) (with
respect to conduct on or after November 5, 2012); Commission Regulation 4.23, 17 C.F.R.

54355, 54358 (Sept. 5, 2012)) (with respect to conduct on or after November 5, 2012 and before
January 2, 2013); Commission Regulation 4.23, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 4.23 (2013) (with respect to conduct
on or after January 2, 2013 and before September 23, 2013); Commission Regulation 4.23, 17
C.F.R. Â§ 4.23 (2014) (with respect to conduct on or after September 23, 2013); Commission
Regulation 160.6, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 160.6 (2011) (with respect to conduct before January 1, 2012);
and Commission Regulation 160.6, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 160.6 (2014) (with respect to conduct on or after
January 1, 2012).

5. Creaghâs false statements to the NFA concealed that WSPM had not maintained
the books and records or provided the account statements and notices to pool participants
required by the Act and Commission Regulations.

6. Accordingly, the Commission brings this action pursuant to Section 6c of the Act,
7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2012), to enjoin Defendantsâ unlawful acts and to compel their compliance
with the Act and Commission Regulations. In addition, the Commission seeks civil monetary
penalties, disgorgement, and such other equitable relief as the Court may deem necessary or
appropriate.

through September 2013.

11. Defendant Gary Creagh is the sole managing member of WSPM and its only
employee. Creagh controls WSPMâs operations, finances, accounts, and books and records, and
he is the sole signatory on WSPMâs bank account and sole person authorized to trade its

IV. OTHER RELEVANT ENTITY

12. Wall Street Pirate Fund, L.P. was a Delaware limited partnership. WSPF was a
single-advisor commodity pool that provided a means by which investors could engage in the
buying and selling of commodity interests. WSPM was the general partner and CPO of WSPF.

13. The National Futures Association is a futures association registered with the

industry, including CPOs and APs of CPOs. Pursuant to its official duties as a registered futures
association, the NFA has developed a body of rules to safeguard market integrity, protect
investors from fraud, and help futures entities and their APs meet regulatory responsibilities.
NFA members are subject to audits and investigations by the NFA to ensure compliance with
NFA rules, the Act, and Commission Regulations. Cooperation and candor by NFA members
with NFA compliance and audit staff are critical to the NFAâs ability to discharge its obligations
as a registered futures association to, among other things, protect members of the public from
persons or entities unlawfully soliciting customers, accepting customer orders, or exercising
trading discretion on behalf of customers.

V. FACTS

A. Operation of the WSPF Commodity Pool

14. On or about March 15, 2012, Creagh, acting as the agent of WSPM, opened a
commodity trading account at the FCM Interactive Brokers in the name of the WSPF commodity
pool. WSPM was identified as the CPO of the pool, and Creagh was identified as the sole
principal of WSPM authorized to effect transactions for the benefit of the Pool Trading Account.

15. | Onor about March 15, 2012, Creagh invested $150,000 with WSPM to
participate in the WSPF commodity pool. On or about that same day, Creagh, acting as the agent
of WSPM as its CPO, deposited the $150,000 into a WSPM account at TD Bank and then
transferred via wire the $150,000 into the Pool Trading Account. Creagh opened the TD Bank
account in the name of WSPM.

16.  Atall times relevant hereto, Creagh was the sole employee of WSPM, the sole
managing member of WSPF, the sole signatory on the WSPM bank account at TD Bank, and the
sole person authorized to trade the commodity trading account carried in the name of WSPF at

the FCM Interactive Brokers. Accordingly, at all times relevant hereto Creagh had personal

.5-
Case 1:15-cv-06140 Documenti Filed 08/05/15 Page 6 of 24

knowledge of the total amount of funds accepted by the pool from participants, the disposition of
said funds, as well as the number of trades effected on behalf of pool participants in the poolâs
commodity trading account and the date each trade was made.

17. Immediately after Creagh transferred the $150,000 into the Pool Trading Account,
WSPM, by and through Creagh, began actively operating the WSPF commodity pool by buying
and selling commodity futures contracts in the Pool Trading Account for the benefit of the
WSPF commodity pool, as described below.

18. On or about April 10, 2012, an acquaintance of Creagh invested $50,000 with
Defendants to participate in the WSPF commodity pool. On or about May 2, 2012, WSPM, by
and through its agent Creagh, deposited these funds into the WSPM account at TD Bank and
then transferred the funds by wire into the Pool Trading Account.

19. On or about May 30, 2012, another acquaintance of Creagh invested $50,000 with
Defendants to participate in the WSPF commodity pool. On or about July 12, 2012, WSPM, by
and through its agent Creagh, deposited the $50,000 into the WSPM account at TD Bank and
then transferred the $50,000 by wire into the Pool Trading Account.

20. All of the funds transferred into the Pool Trading Account were funds belonging
to the WSPF commodity pool participants and were used to effect commodity futures
transactions.

21. Asreflected in the daily activity statements for the Pool Trading Account,
WSPM, by and through its agent Creagh, placed hundreds of commodity futures trades for the

benefit of the pool throughout calendar year 2012.
Case 1:15-cv-06140 Document1 Filed 08/05/15 Page 7 of 24

B. False Statements Made to the NFA

22. In furtherance of its official duties under the Act, the NFA conducts periodic
audits and examinations of NFA members as a means of monitoring and assuring compliance
with NFA rules, the Act, and Commission Regulations.

23. In addition, pursuant to NFA rules, the Act, and Commission Regulations, CPOs
are required to file with the NFA quarterly financial reports for each pool the CPO operates.
CPOs may file these quarterly reports electronically with the NFA using the NFAâs EasyFile
system (the âEasyFileâ). One of the prompts for an individual effecting a report using EasyFile
. 1 whether the pool at issue was active or not during the reporting period.

24. During the relevant period, WSPM, by and through its agent Creagh, filed four
false written quarterly reports with the NFA and thereafter made false oral statements to the NFA
during an NFA audit of WSPM.

25. | Onor about May 31, 2012, WSPM, by and through its agent Creagh, filed with
the NFA through EasyFile a false quarterly report for the quarter ending March 30, 2012.

26. Despite that between March 15, 2012 and March 31, 2012, WSPM accepted funds
from a pool participant and traded multiple commodity futures contracts in the Pool Trading
Account for the benefit of that pool participant, WSPM, by and through its agent Creagh, falsely
represented to the NFA that the WSPF commodity pool did not operate during that period.
Creagh knew this statement was false as he knew WSPM had accepted WSPF pool participant
funds and he actively traded commodity futures contracts as the agent of WSPF during the
reporting period.

27. | On about September 12, 2012, WSPM, by and through its agent Creagh, filed a

second false quarterly report with the NFA through EasyFile.
Case 1:15-cv-06140 Document1 Filed 08/05/15 Page 8 of 24

28. Despite that between April 1, 2012 and June 30, 2012, WSPM accepted $100,000
from two pool participants and traded multiple commodity futures contracts in the Pool Trading
Account on behalf of the WSPF commodity pool, WSPM, by and through its agent Creagh,
falsely represented to the NFA that the WSPF commodity pool did not operate during that
period. Creagh knew this statement was false as he knew WSPM had accepted WSPF pool
participant funds and he had actively traded commodity futures contracts as the agent of WSPF
during the reporting period.

29. Onor about February 12, 2013, WSPM, by and through its agent Creagh, filed
additional false reports with NFA through EasyFile.

30. Despite that WSPM traded multiple commodity futures contracts in the Pool
Trading Account on behalf of WSPF between July 1, 2012 and December 31, 2012, WSPM, by
and through its agent Creagh, falsely represented to the NFA that the WSPF commodity pool did
not operate during that period. Creagh knew this statement was false as he had actively traded
commodity futures contracts on behalf of WSPF during the reporting period.

31. On June 12, 2014, during testimony under oath before the Commission, Creagh
admitted filing false quarterly reports with NFA.

32. Subsequent to the filing of these false reports, on March 4, 2013, the NFA
conducted an unannounced on-site audit of WSPM, at its offices in New York, New York, to
ensure the firm was in compliance with its recordkeeping and financial requirements.

33. During the audit, Creagh, individually and as the agent and managing member of
WSPM, falsely represented to the NFA orally that WSPF was not active during calendar year

2012. Creagh knew these statements were false as he knew WSPM had accepted funds from
Case 1:15-cv-06140 Documenti Filed 08/05/15 Page 9 of 24

prospective pool participants and he actively traded commodity futures contracts in the Pool
Trading Account on behalf of WSPF throughout calendar year 2012.

34. OnJune 12, 2014, during testimony under oath before the Commission, Creagh
admitted that the WSPF commodity pool was active in 2012. Creagh also admitted that WSPM
accepted funds from WSPF pool participants and traded commodity futures contracts on behalf

of WSPF throughout 2012.

C. Failure to Keep Books and Records, and Provide Account Statements and Privacy
Notices to Pool Participants

35. As described in more detail below, the Act and Commission Regulations require
registered CPOs to maintain certain books and records concerning the CPO and each pool it
operates, and provide periodic account statements and privacy notices to pool participants.

36. Atall times during the relevant period, the WSPF commodity pool held net assets
less than $500,000.

37. Despite operating the WSPF commodity pool during the relevant period by
among other things, accepting pool participant funds and trading commodity futures on behalf of
the pool, WSPM failed to maintain the books and records required by Commission Regulations.

38. Specifically, WSPM did not maintain, among other books and records: (1) a
general ledger, (2) statement of financial condition, (3) statement of income/loss, and/or (4) a
cash receipts and disbursements journal.

39. On June 12, 2014, during testimony under oath before the Commission, Creagh
admitted that the WSPF commodity pool, which WSPM operated, did not maintain these

required records.
Case 1:15-cv-06140 Document1 Filed 08/05/15 Page 10 of 24

40. Additionally, despite operating the WSPF commodity pool during the relevant
period, WSPM failed to prepare and distribute periodic accounts statements to the WSPF
commodity pool participants, as required by the Act and Commission Regulations.

41. Specifically, WSPM failed to provide pool participants with at least quarterly
account statements covering the ten month period during which WSPM operated the WSPF pool
in 2012, and a timely annual report for 2012.

42. On June 12, 2014, during testimony under oath before the Commission, Creagh
admitted that during the life of the WSPF commodity pool, he never provided pool participants
monthly or quarterly account statements.

43. Furthermore, WSPM failed to provide to the WSPF pool participants the privacy
notices required by Commission Regulations. Specifically, WSPM failed to notify pool
participants of the categories of nonpublic personal information that WSPM collected and
WSPMâs policies and practices with respect to protecting the confidentiality and security of that
information, as required by Commission Regulation 160.6, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 160.6 (2011) (with
respect to conduct before January 1, 2012), and Commission Regulation 160.6, 17 C.F.R.

Â§ 160.6 (2014) (with respect to conduct on or after January 1, 2012).

44. On June 12, 2014, during testimony under oath before the Commission, Creagh
admitted that WSPM did not provide this required information to the WSPF pool participants.

45. Unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, Defendants are likely to continue to
engage in the acts and practices alleged in this Complaint and in similar acts and practices.

71. As alleged above, WSPM failed to provide participants in the WSPF commodity
pool with (1) Account Statement(s) covering any of the ten months it operated during calendar
year 2012, and (2) a timely Annual Report covering its operations for calendar year 2012.
Accordingly, WSPM violated Section 4n(4) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6n(4) (2012); Commission
Regulation 4.22, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 4.22 (2012) (with respect to conduct before November 5, 2012);

of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13c(b) (2012).

73. Each failure to issue required Account Statement(s) and Annual Report to pool
participants, including but not limited to those alleged herein, is alleged as a separate and distinct
violation of, as applicable, Section 4n(4) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6n(4) (2012); Commission
Regulation 4.22, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 4.22 (2012) (with respect to conduct before November 5, 2012);

COUNT IV

FAILURE TO ISSUE REQUIRED PRIVACY NOTICES
(VIOLATIONS OF 17 C.F.R. Â§ 160.4 (2014))

74. The allegations in the foregoing paragraphs are incorporated herein by reference.

75. Commission Regulation 160.4, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 160.4 (2014), requires every
registered CPO to provide an initial privacy notice to each of its customers when the customer
provides funds for an interest in a commodity pool.

76. The required initial privacy notice must include, among other information: (1) the
categories of nonpublic personal information that the CPO collects, and (2) the CPOâs policies
and practices with respect to protecting the confidentiality and security of that information.
Commission Regulation 160.6, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 160.6 (2011) (with respect to conduct before January
1, 2012); Commission Regulation 160.6, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 160.6 (2014) (with respect to conduct on or
after January 1, 2012).

77. = WSPM did not provide to participants in the WSPF commodity pool notice of the
categories of nonpublic personal information that WSPM collected or WSPMâs policies and
practices with respect to protecting the confidentiality and security of that information.
Accordingly, WSPM violated Commission Regulation 160.6, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 160.6 (2011) (with
respect to conduct before January 1, 2012), and Commission Regulation 160.6, 17 C.F.R.

Â§ 160.6 (2014) (with respect to conduct on or after January 1, 2012).

78. At all times pertinent to this Complaint, Creagh controlled WSPM, directly or
indirectly, and did not act in good faith or knowingly induced, directly or indirectly, the acts
constituting WSPMâs violations of Commission Regulations. Therefore, Creagh is liable for
WSPMâs violations of Commission Regulation 160.6, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 160.6 (2011) (with respect to

conduct before January 1, 2012), and Commission Regulation 160.6, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 160.6 (2014)

(with respect to conduct on or after January 1, 2012), pursuant to Section 13(b) of the Act, 7
U.S.C. Â§ 13c(b) (2012).

79. Each failure to provide the required privacy notices, including but not limited to
those alleged herein, are alleged as separate and distinct violations of Commission Regulation
160.6, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 160.6 (2011) (with respect to conduct before January 1, 2012), and
Commission Regulation 160.6, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 160.6 (2014) (with respect to conduct on or after

CFTC Charges New York Resident Gary Creagh and his Company, Wall Street Pirate
Management, LLC, with Making False Statements to the National Futures Association

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced the filing of an
enforcement action charging Defendants Gary Creagh and Wall Street Pirate Management, LLC (Wall Street Pirate),
both of New York, New York, with making false, fictitious, or fraudulent statements or omissions to the National Futures
Association (NFA) in statutorily required reports and during an NFA audit, in violation of the Commodity Exchange Act
(CEA). Both Wall Street Pirate and Creagh, the managing member and sole employee of Wall Street Pirate, were
registered with the CFTC at the time of the conduct.

The CFTC Complaint, filed on August 5, 2015, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges that,
from at least December 2011 through September 2013, Creagh willfully made false statements or representations to the
NFA and concealed material information from the NFA. Specifically, Creagh falsely represented to the NFA on multiple
occasions that the commodity pool he operated on behalf of Wall Street Pirate was not active, despite the fact that he
had accepted funds from prospective pool participants and actively traded commodity futures on behalf of the
commodity pool, according to the Complaint. The CFTC Complaint also charges that Wall Street Pirate, by and through
Creagh, failed to maintain required books and records and provide account statements and privacy notices to pool
participants.

The NFA is a Chicago-based futures association, which is registered with the CFTC and serves as an industry self-
regulatory organization. Pursuant to the CEA, the NFA is responsible, under CFTC oversight, for certain aspects of the
regulation of futures entities and their associated persons.

In its continuing litigation against the Defendants, the CFTC seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, restitution to
defrauded customers, a civil monetary penalty, permanent trading and registration bans, and a permanent injunction
against further violations of the federal commodities laws, as charged.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Jonah E. McCarthy, Timothy J. Mulreany,
Patricia Gomersall, and Paul G. Hayeck.

The CFTC would like to thank the NFA for its cooperation in this matter.

Respondent.

 

ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTIONS 6(c) and 6(d) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, MAKING
FINDINGS AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

1,

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ) has reason to believe that
since at least January 2013 through July 21, 2013 (the âRelevant Periodâ), INTL FCStone
Markets, LLC (âIFCSâ or âRespondentââ) violated Commission Regulation (âRegulationâ)
23.602, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 23.602 (2014). Therefore, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the
public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted to determine
whether Respondent engaged in the violations as set forth herein and to determine whether any
order should be issued imposing remedial sanctions.

Il.

In anticipation of the institution of this administrative proceeding, Respondent has
submitted an Offer of Settlement (âOfferâ), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Without admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, Respondent consents to
the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 6(c) and 6(d) of the
Commodity Exchange Act, Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (âOrderâ) and
acknowledges service of this Order,â

 

Respondent consents to the entry of this Order and to the use of these findings in this
proceeding and in any other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission
is a party; provided, however, that Respondent does not consent to the use of the Offer, or the
findings or conclusions in this Order consented to in the Offer, as the sole basis for any other
proceeding brought by the Commission, other than in a proceeding in bankruptcy or to enforce
the terms of this Order. Nor does Respondent consent to the use of the Offer or this Order, or the
findings or conclusions in this Order consented to in the Offer, by any other party in any other
proceeding.

 
III.
The Commission finds the following:
A. SUMMARY

Respondent violated Regulation 23,602, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 23.602 (2014), when it failed to
diligently supervise limited purpose traders (âLPTsâ) in its Kansas City Energy Group (the
âKCEGâ), failed to implement existing policies and procedures regarding discretionary trading,
and failed to enforce its own policies regarding the application of mark-ups to customer
transactions.

Respondent has cooperated with the Division of Enforcement (âDivisionâ) during its
investigation. In addition, Respondent has cooperated with, implemented, and continues to
implement several of the recommendations provided by the Division of Swap Dealer and
Intermediary Oversight (ââDSIOâ) during its review of Respondentâs internal controls.

B. RESPONDENT

Respondent is registered with the Commission (NFA ID 0449652) as a swap dealer
(provisionally, effective December 31, 2012), Respondent is a subsidiary of INTL FCStone Inc.,
which is a financial services company incorporated in Delaware and headquartered in New York.
INTL FCStone Inc. is a publicly held company traded on the NASDAQ,

C, FACTS

During the Relevant Period, Gregory Evans (âEvansâ), then employed in Respondentâs
KCEG as an AP, entered into energy swap agreements on behalf of IFCS with its customers. He
also entered into futures trades on behalf of IFCS to hedge the risk from these swap agreements.
He handled both discretionary accounts, an arrangement where a broker has power of attorney,
usually a written agreement to buy and sell without prior approval, and non-discretionary
accounts, an arrangement where a broker has to obtain prior approval to buy and sell a particular
contract.

Evans engaged in thirty (30) unauthorized trades in a non-discretionary customer account
during the Relevant Period. Evans also applied large âreverse mark-upsâ to bilateral swap
agreement transactions in order to disguise these unauthorized trades.

âReverse mark-upsâ reference the price of a hedge contract entered into by IFCS, in
which it provided the customer with better prices than the actual prices at which Respondent
entered into the underlying hedge transactions, A reverse mark-up resulted in gains for
customers and corresponding losses for Respondent. This practice assisted Evans in disguising
his unauthorized trading and increasing his own compensation.

 

, An âLPTâ is a broker who performs both sales and trade execution functions, i.e. in

limited instances swaps traders were permitted to execute trades in IFCSâs name, and also hedge
those transactions with futures trades.

 
Respondent failed to diligently supervise Evans and the other LPTs in the KCEG as it (1)
provided inadequate oversight of Evans and the other LPTs; (ii) lacked adequate policies and
procedures to ensure that discretionary trading of customer accounts was appropriate and
properly controlled; and (iii) failed to implement policies and procedures already in place.

For example, LPTs often obtained verbal authorization to enter into discretionary trades,
although IFCSâs written compliance procedures required written authorization if an LPT
exercised discretion over customer trades, Moreover, IFCS did not have sufficient procedures or
controls in place to monitor discretionary trading during the Relevant Period. Although IFCSâs
policies and procedures provided for an individual with supervisory duties to work on the KCEG
âSwaps Sales desk,â LPTsâ trading activities were not closely or regularly monitored by
supervisors. Finally, Respondent failed to adequately monitor compliance with, and enforce, its
own procedures, which purported to require that mark-ups and reverse mark-ups applied to
customers be within a predetermined range.

Respondentâs lack of supervision contributed to Evans engaging in unauthorized trading
for a period of several months without detection. Ultimately, however, the losses and resultant
pressure on Evans mounted, culminating with his July 21, 2013 resignation from IFCS.

Respondent has been cooperative with DSIO throughout the course of its review and is
finalizing implementation of DSIOâs recommendations. Respondent reimbursed its customers
more than $1.2 million for the identified losses in their accounts. IFCS also suffered losses from
the reverse mark-ups Evans applied to customer accounts.

IV. LEGAL DISCUSSION
Regulation 23.602(a) requires that swap dealers and major swap participants

establish and maintain a system to supervise, and shall diligently
supervise, all activities relating to its business performed by its
partners, members, officers, employees, and agents (or persons
occupying a similar status or performing a similar function), Such
system shall be reasonably designed to achieve compliance with
the requirements of the Commodity Exchange Act and
Commission regulations.

17 CER. Â§ 23.602(a) (2014).

The operative language of Regulation 23.602(a) is similar to the language of the
Commissionâs longstanding supervision regulation, Regulation 166.3, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 166.3 (2014),
and its case law is therefore instructive. Regulation 166.3 has been interpreted as requiring that,
in order to establish a failure to supervise, the Commission establish that a registrantâs
supervisory system was generally inadequate or that the registrant failed to perform its
supervisory duties diligently. See, e.g., Inre Murlas Commodities, [1994-1996 Transfer Binder]
Comm, Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) 26,485 at 43,161 (CFTC Sept. 1, 1995); Jn re Paragon Futures

 
Assoc., [1990-1992 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) J 25,266 at 38,850 (CFTC Apr.
1, 1992).

Regulation 23.602(b) defines a âsupervisory systemâ as one that, at a minimum, provides
for:

(1) [t]he designation, where applicable, of at least one person
with authority to carry out the supervisory responsibilities
of the swap dealer or major swap participant for all
activities relating to its business as a swap dealer or major
swap participant.

(2) [t]he use of reasonable efforts to determine that all
supervisors are qualified and meet such standards of
training, experience, competence, and such other
qualification standards as the Commission finds necessary
or appropriate.

17 CER. Â§ 23.602(b) (2014).

Respondent failed to diligently supervise the activities of its swap dealer business in
violation of Regulation 23.602. Specifically, there was inadequate supervision of the junior
LPTs and trading activity of the KCEG. Although Respondent had some written procedures
regarding discretionary accounts and mark-ups, IFCS failed to enforce those policies, and thus
failed to perform its supervisory duties diligently. Evidence of violations that âshould be
detected by a diligent system of supervision, either because of the nature of the violations or
because the violations have occurred repeatedlyâ is probative of a failure to supervise. Paragon
Futures, Â§ 25,266 at 38,850.

Similarly, Respondent lacked a system to monitor mark-ups and reverse mark-ups on
trades, or compliance with the procedures it purportedly adopted in May 2013 regarding
minimum and maximum mark-ups.

CFTC Orders Swap Dealer INTL FCStone Markets, LLC to Pay a $200,000 Civil Monetary
Penalty for Failure to Supervise Swaps Trading in Violation of CFTC Regulation 23.602

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today filed and simultaneously settled
charges against INTL FCStone Markets, LLC (FCStone), a provisionally registered Swap Dealer, for failure to diligently
supervise traders in its Kansas City Energy Group (KCEG), imposing a civil monetary penalty of $200,000. FCStone is a
subsidiary of INTL FCStone Inc., a financial services company based in New York, New York.

The CFTC Order finds that FCStone provided inadequate oversight of traders in its Kansas City Energy Group, lacked
adequate policies and procedures to ensure that discretionary trading of customer accounts was appropriate and
properly controlled, and failed to implement policies and procedures already in place. Such conduct violated CFTC
Regulation 23.602, which requires swap dealers and major swap participants to diligently supervise their employees and
establish and maintain systems to do so. This is the first CFTC enforcement action charging violations of Regulation
23.602, which imposes supervision standards specifically applicable to swap dealers.

According to the CFTCâs Order, from at least January 2013 through July 21, 2013 (the relevant period), traders in
FCStoneâs KCEG often obtained verbal authorization to enter into discretionary trades, although FCStoneâs written
compliance procedures required written authorization if a trader exercised discretion over customer trades. Moreover,
the Order finds that FCStone did not have sufficient procedures or controls in place to monitor discretionary trading
during the relevant period. Although FCStoneâs policies and procedures provided for an individual with supervisory duties
to work on the KCEGâs Swaps Sales desk, trading activities were not closely or regularly monitored. For example, the
Order finds that of FCStoneâs traders, Gregory Evans engaged in 30 unauthorized trades in a non-discretionary account,
resulting in customer losses of approximately $1.2 million during the relevant period (see CFTC Press Release and
Consent Order 7187-15, June 16, 2015). FCStoneâs lack of supervision contributed to Evans engaging in unauthorized
trading without detection for a period of several months, according to the Order.

In addition to imposing the civil monetary penalty, the Order also requires FCStone to cease and desist from further
violations of CFTC Regulation 23.602, as charged.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this action are Sophia Siddiqui, Jonah E. McCarthy, Dmitriy
Vilenskiy, John Einstman, Rachel Hayes, and Paul G. Hayeck. Kevin Piccoli, Thomas J. Bloom, and Lauren Fulks from the
CFTCâs Division of Swap Dealer and Intermediary Oversight also assisted with this matter.

Federal Court in Illinois Orders Former Sentinel Management Group, Inc. Senior Vice
President Charles K. Mosley to Pay More than $2 Million for Misusing Customer Funds

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced that Judge Charles P.
Kocoras of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois entered an Order of Permanent Injunction against
Charles K. Mosley of Vernon Hills, Illinois, resolving charges of customer funds segregation violations of Section 4d(b)
of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) concerning Mosleyâs role as trader and former Senior Vice President in the
handling of $562 million in commodity customer segregated funds that had been managed by Sentinel Management
Group, Inc. (Sentinel).

The Order, entered on August 11, 2015, requires Mosley to pay $551,000 in disgorgement and a $1,653,000 civil
monetary penalty. The Order also imposes a permanent trading and registration ban on Mosley and prohibits him from
further violations of the CEA, as charged.

The Order stems from a CFTC Complaint filed against Sentinel, Mosley, and Sentinelâs former President and Chief
Executive Officer Eric A. Bloom (Bloom) on April 28, 2008, which charged Mosley with aiding and abetting Sentinelâs
commingling and misappropriation of commodity customer funds it received from various Futures Commission Merchants
from at least May 21, 2007 through August 17, 2007 (see CFTC Press Release 5494-08). According to the Order, Sentinel
improperly commingled and misappropriated customer funds to finance Sentinelâs proprietary trading, failed to treat and
deal with customer funds as belonging to its commodity customers, withdrew customer segregated funds beyond
Sentinelâs actual interest therein, and used the funds to collateralize its overnight loan with the Bank of New York, in
violation of Section 4d(b) of the CEA. The Order also finds that Mosley aided and abetted these violations.

The U.S. Attorneyâs Office in Chicago brought a related criminal case against Mosley and Bloom based on the same
conduct at issue in the CFTCâs case (United States v. Eric A. Bloom and Charles K. Mosley, No. 12-cr-00409 (N.D. Ill.). In
that proceeding, on October 8, 2013, Mosley pleaded guilty to two counts of investment adviser fraud, and on March 25,
2014, a jury convicted Bloom of 18 counts of wire fraud and one count of investment advisor fraud after a four-week trial.
On January 30, 2015, Federal District Court Judge Ronald A. Guzman sentenced Mosley to eight years in federal prison
and Bloom to 14 years in prison and ordered the two men jointly to pay over $665 million in restitution (see FBI Press
Release, January 30, 2015). Mosley is scheduled to begin serving his prison sentence on September 9, 2015. Bloom has
appealed his criminal conviction, but he began serving his prison sentence in June 2015.

The CFTC obtained an injunction against Sentinel on August 3, 2009, which also is the subject of an on-going bankruptcy
action (see /n re Sentinel Management Group, No. 07-14987 (Brktcy. N.D. Ill.). The CFTCâs case against Bloom is still
pending.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this action are Brigitte Weyls, Susan Gradman, Scott
Williamson, and Rosemary Hollinger.

Defendants.

This matter is before the court on Plaintiff U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commissionâs (âCFTCâ) Motion for Default Judgment [DE-26]. For the reasons stated below,
the motion is ALLOWED.

L PROCEDURAL HISTORY AND FINDINGS OF FACT""

This action arises out of fraudulent trading activity that Defendants David Christopher
Mayhew (âMayhewâ) and Ron Earl McCullough (âMcCulloughâ) participated in both
individually and collectively. Between December 2008 and January 2012, the defendants
fraudulently solicited approximately 2.3 million dollars from at least eleven members of the
public. McCullough and Mayhew also used Travis Cox to both solicit funds from investors and
further their fraud. They represented to Cox that they were millionaires and that they had made

their money through foreign exchange, or âforexâ trading. McCullough and Mayhew made

 

' These facts are taken from the Complaint and the Declarations regarding the Motion for Default
Judgment [DE-26] and the documents in support of the Plaintiff's Memorandum in Support of Motion for
Default Judgment [DE-27]. See Declarations [DE-28, -29, -30]; Exhibits [DE-34, -35, -36].

Case 5:14-cv-00083-F Document 37 Filed 08/14/15 Page 1 of 11
 

Travis Cox a âpartnerâ whereby they simultaneously defrauded him and used his trust in them to
further their fraud against other victims.

The defendantsâ basic scheme worked in the following manner: the âtraderâ
(McCullough, Mayhew, or Travis Cox) would approach a potential investor to solicit trade
money; they would entice potential investors by falsely promising high returns, falsely
guaranteeing the security of the investorsâ principle, and misrepresenting the risks of trading.
Once the defendants had the money, they would either use the funds for personal use or use the
funds to repay other investors, thereby creating the appearance of a successful trade and
furthering the fraud. By doing this, the defendants were able to get at least two customers to
reinvest with them. Over the course of the fraud, the defendants received approximately $2.03
million dollars from customers. The defendants lost $394,000 trading in Forex, misappropriated
$808,000 to repay investors, created the false appearance of profits, and misappropriated
$829,000 for personal use.

CFTC filed an Affidavit of Service of Summons and Complaint [DE-5] on February 24,
2014. Mayhew was personally served in this matter. Pl.âs Mem. Supp. Mot. Default J. [DE-27] at
1. McCullough is currently a fugitive, avoiding pending criminal charges in the same matter. Jd.
at 2. CFTC sought permission of the court for service by publication. See Plaintiffs Motion for
an Order Authorizing Service by Publication and Extending Time for Service [DE-13]. The court
granted CFTCâs motion for service by publication as to McCullough on September 2, 2014. See
Order of September 2, 2014 [DE-18]. On the same date, this court granted CFTCâs motion for
default against Mayhew. See id. After McCullough was served by publication, the Clerk of Court

entered default judgment against him. See Clerkâs Entry of Default [DE-25}. Because both

2

Case 5:14-cv-00083-F Document 37 Filed 08/14/15 Page 2 of 11
 

defendants have not responded throughout the course of this litigation, CFTC now seeks entry of
default judgment.
Il. DISCUSSION
A. Entry of default judgment

Entry of default judgment is authorized by Rule 55 when a defendant âhas failed to plead
or otherwise defendâ a suit in accordance with the Rules. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(a). When a
defendant is in default, all of the well-pleaded factual allegations of the complaint are deemed
admitted. Ryan v. Homecomings Fin. Network, 253 F.3d 778, 780 (4th Cir. 2001). Having
accepted the well-pleaded allegations of fact in the Complaint as true, the court must still
determine whether those allegations support the relief sought. /d.

i. Defendant Mayhew

The case of default against defendant Mayhew is straightforward. Rule 55 allows entry of
default when a defendant fails to plead or otherwise defend a lawsuit. Mayhew was personally
served on February 24, 2014, but has made no attempt to respond to this action. See Aff. [DE-5].
Default has been entered against him. See Entry of Default [DE-19]. He continues to show no
interest in defending the suit, even though he has had some sixteen months to respond, during
which time he was tried and found guilty of multiple accounts relating to the fraud underling this
case. See Jury Verdict [DE-145], United States v. Mayhew, No. 5:13-CR-199-F-2. A court can
enter default judgment after a defendant has received adequate notice of the action and still fails
to make an effort to defend the suit. See Boddie v. Connecticut, 401 U.S. 371, 378 (1971) (citing
Windsor v. McVeigh, 93 U.S. 274, 278 (1876)). This court is satisfied that personal service, and

over sixteen monthsâ time to respond, is adequate opportunity for Mayhew to defend this suit.

3
Case 5:14-cv-00083-F Document 37 Filed 08/14/15 Page 3 of 11
 

 

this suit. The court concludes that the procedural requirements for entry of default judgment have
been met as to Mayhew.

ii. Defendant McCullough

In the case of persons who are missing, employment of likely futile means of service,
such as service by publication, are often all the plaintiff can achieve. Mullane v. Central Hanover
Bank & Tr. Co., 339 U.S. 306, 317 (1950). In those circumstances, service by publication does
not create a âconstitutional bar to a final decree foreclosing [the missing defendantâs] rights.â Jd.

Defendant McCullough is currently a fugitive. CFTC attempted to serve process on
McCullough at his last known Raleigh address, and at two addresses in Georgia where there was
reason to believe McCullough might be residing. See Summons in a Civil Action [DE-4];
Declaration of Plaintiffs Investigator in Support of Motion for an Order Authorizing Service by
Publication and Extending Time for Service [DE-14-1] {Â§ 2-5, 7. None of these attempts were
successful. CFTC further attempted to serve McCullough through four email addresses
associated with him. See Decl. Pl.âs Investigator [DE-14-1] ] 8. CFTC received no response. The
court then granted CFTC permission to serve McCullough by publication, which CFTC carried
out. See Order of September 2, 2014 [DE-18]. CFTC again received no response. See Affidavit
of Plaintiff's Counsel in Support of Motion Requesting Entry of Default of Defendant Ron Earl
McCullough [DE-22]. Default has been entered against McCullough. Clerkâs Entry of Default
[DE-25]. The court concludes that the procedural requirements for entry of default judgment
have been met as to McCullough
B. Remedies

Simply because the defendants are in default does not automatically mean the plaintiffs are

entitled to their requested relief. Rather, having accepted the well-pleaded allegations of fact in

4
Case 5:14-cv-00083-F Document 37 Filed 08/14/15 Page 4 of 11
 

 

the Complaint as true, the court must still determine whether those allegations support the relief
sought. Ryan, 253 F.3d at 780. All of CFTCâs requested relief is authorized under the statute that
the defendants have violated. See 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1. All of the sums requested are supported by
detailed affidavits and exhibits. For those reasons and the reasons outlined below, the court finds
that CFTC is entitled to its requested relief.

i. Injunctive Relief

CFTC seeks injunctive relief against the defendants. Injunctive relief is authorized by
statute. See 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(a) and (b). Section 13a-1 states that any person who violates the act
may be subject to an order enjoining their actions and ordering compliance with the Act. Jd.
Â§ 13a-1(a). After a violation of the act is established, CFTC need only show a likelihood of
future violations. CFTC v. British Am. Commodity Options Corp., 560 F.2d 135, 141 (2d Cir.
1977). A violation has been established, and CFTC argues that, given the repetitive and ongoing
nature of the defendantsâ fraud, there is a reasonable likelihood that the two will continue to
engage in fraudulent activities. This court agrees. CFTCâs request for an injunction is
ALLOWED. Defendants David Mayhew and Ron McCullough are hereby restrained, enjoined
and prohibited from either directly or indirectly:

a. cheating or defrauding or attempting to cheat or defraud, or willfully or

recklessly deceiving or attempting to deceive other persons in or in connection

with off-exchange agreements, contracts, or transactions in foreign currency that

are leveraged or margined, made or to be made, for or on behalf of, or with, other

persons, in violation of 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6b(a)(2)(A) and (C), and 17 C.F_R. Â§Â§
5.2(b)(1) and (3);

b. willfully providing false information to others, thereby causing them to
issue false account statements, in or in connection with off-exchange agreements,
contracts, or transactions in foreign currency that are leveraged or margined,
made or to be made, for or on behalf of, or with, other persons, in violation of 7
U,S.C. Â§ 6b(a)(2)(B) and 17 C.F.R. Â§ 5.2(b)(2);

5

Case 5:14-cv-00083-F Document 37 Filed 08/14/15 Page 5 of 11
 

c. aiding, abetting, counseling, inducing, procuring or working in
combination or concert with each other to violate the Act or Regulations, in
violation of 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13c(a);

d. trading on or subject to the rules of any registered entity (as that term is
defined in 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1a(40) (2012));

â¬. entering into any transactions involving commodity interests (as that term
is defined in 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.3(yy) (2014)) for their own personal accounts or for
any account in which they have a direct or indirect interest;

f, having any commodity interests traded on their behalf;

g. controlling or directing the trading for or on behalf of any other person or
entity, whether by power of attorney or otherwise, in any account involving
commodity interests;

h. soliciting, receiving, or accepting any funds from any person for the
purpose of purchasing or selling any commodity interests;

i. applying for registration or claiming exemption from registration with the
Commission in any capacity, and engaging in any activity requiring such
registration or exemption from registration with the Commission, except as
provided for in 17 C.F.R. Â§ 4.14(a)(9) (2014); and

j. acting as a principal (as that term is defined in 17 C.F.R. Â§ 3.1(a) (2014)),
agent or any other officer or employee of any person (as that term is defined in 7
U.S.C. Â§ 1a(38) (2012)) registered, required to be registered or exempted from
registration with the Commission, except as provided for 17 C.F.R. Â§ 4.14(a)(9)
(2014).

Monetary Relief

CFTC seeks monetary relief against the defendants. A judgement by default may be

entered without a hearing on damages when the amount is capable of being ascertained from
definite figures contained in detailed affidavits. J & J Sports Prods., Inc. v. Waters, No. 3:11-
CV-552-MU, 2013 WL 3353904, at *1 (W.D.N.C. Jul. 3, 2013). Furthermore, as previously
stated, all the well-pleaded factual allegations in the Complaint are deemed admitted, and the
defendants are deemed liable. Ryan, 253 F.3d at 780. CFTC requests that the court enter default
judgment in the amount of $1,223,388.43 for restitution to Mayhew and McCulloughâs

defrauded customers and a civil monetary penalty of $2,486,620.00.

6
Case 5:14-cv-00083-F Document 37 Filed 08/14/15 Page 6 of 11
 

Restitution is authorized here by Title 7, United States Code section 13a-1. The district
court has the authority to order equitable relief in the form of restitution when a defendant is
found to be in violation of the Commodity Exchange Act. See CFTC v. Co Petro Mktg. Grp.,
Inc., 680 F.2d 573, 583 (9th Cir. 1982). CFTC argues that âthe objectives of the [Commodity
Exchange] Act are best served by ordering full restitution to Defendantsâ customers.â P1.âs
Mem. Supp. Mot. Default J. [DE-27] at 16. The court agrees.

To determine the appropriate amount of restitution, courts calculate the amount given to
the defendant by investors and subtract any amount returned to investors. CFTC v. Noble Wealth
Data Info. Servs., Inc., 90 F. Supp. 2d 676, 693 (D. Md. 2000) overruled on other grounds by
CFTC v. Baragosh, 278 F.3d 319 (4th Cir. 2002). This restitution request is supported by a
number of detailed investigator affidavits and exhibits. See Declaration of Defendantsâ Customer
James Perry Fergus, Jr. [DE-32]; Exhibits [DE-34]; Exhibits [DE-35]; and Exhibits [DE-36].
These exhibits outline the amounts of money given to the defendants by each of the defrauded
investors. The requested amount of restitution is the total amount of funds received from
defrauded customersâ$2,03 1,388.43ââless the amount returned to customersâ$808,000â
which results in a total of $1,223,388.43 in allowable restitution. CFTCâs request for restitution
is ALLOWED.

Section 13a-1 also authorizes the court to order a civil monetary penalty (âCMPâ). The
relevant portion of the statute states that in any action brought under the section, a person found
to be in violation of the section may be ordered to pay a civil penalty of $100,000 or three times
the monetary gain of each violation, whichever is greater. 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(d)(1). Here, three

times the monetary gain of the fraud, the gain being $828,873.29, is greater than the minimum

7

$100,000. Thus, entry of a CMP in the amount of $2,486,619.87 is appropriate. In accordance

with the rules outlined in the statute, CFTCâs request for CMP is ALLOWED.

CONCLUSION
It is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that

1. the requested injunctive relief is granted. The Defendants, David Mayhew and
Ron McCullough, are hereby restrained, enjoined and prohibited from the actions
described in this Order at section II(b)(i), paragraphs a-j;

2. that the Defendants shall pay, jointly and severally, restitution in the amount of
$1,223,388.43 (âRestitution Obligationâ), plus post-judgment interest. Post-judgment
interest shall accrue on the Restitution Obligation beginning on the date of entry of this
Order and shall be determined by using the Treasury Bill rate prevailing on the date of
entry of this Order, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1961;

3. that the Defendants are also accused in a criminal action charging them, in part,
for the misconduct that is at issue in this matter. See United States v. McCullough, Crim
No, 5:13-CR-199-F (E.D.N.C.) (âCriminal Actionâ). For amounts disbursed to the
Defendantsâ customers as a result of satisfaction of any restitution ordered in the
Criminal Action, the defendants shall receive a dollar-for-dollar credit against the
Restitution Obligation. Within ten (10) days of disbursement in the Criminal Action to
the Defendantsâ customers, the defendants shall, under a cover letter that identifies the
name and docket number of this proceeding, transmit to the Chief Financial Officer,
CFTC, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20581, and the
Office of Administration, National Futures Association, 300 South Riverside Plaza, Suite
1800, Chicago, IL 60606, copies of the form of payment to those customers;

4, that to effect payment of the Restitution Obligation and the distribution of any
restitution payments to the defendantsâ customers, the court appoints the National Futures
Association (âNFAâ) as Monitor. The Monitor shall collect restitution payments from the
Defendants and make distributions as set forth below. Because the Monitor is acting as an
officer of this court in performing these services, the NFA shall not be liable for any
action or inaction arising from NFAâs appointment as Monitor, other than actions
involving fraud;

5, that the Defendants shall make Restitution Obligation payments under this Order
to the Monitor in the name âMcCullough-Mayhew â Settlement/Restitution Fundâ and
shall send such Restitution Obligation payments by electronic funds transfer, or by U.S.
postal money order, certified check, bank cashierâs, or bank money order, to the Office of
Administration, National Futures Association, 300 South Riverside Plaza, Suite 1800,
Chicago, Illinois 60606, with a cover letter that identifies the paying Defendant(s) and the
name and docket number of this proceeding. The Defendants shall simultaneously

transmit copies of the cover letter and the form of payment to the Chief Financial Officer,
CFTC, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20581;

6. that the Monitor shall oversee the Restitution Obligation and shall have the
discretion to determine the manner of distribution of such funds in an equitable fashion to
the Defendantsâ customers identified by the Commission or may defer distribution until
such time as the Monitor deems appropriate. In the event that the amount of Restitution
Obligation payments to the Monitor are of a de minimis nature such that the Monitor
determines that the administrative cost of making a distribution to eligible customers is
impractical, the Monitor may, in its discretion, treat such restitution payments as CMP
payments, which the Monitor shall forward to the Commission following the instructions
for CMP payments set forth in Paragraphs 12 through 13 below;

7. that the Defendants shall cooperate with the Monitor as appropriate to provide
such information as the Monitor deems necessary and appropriate to identify the
defendantsâ customers to whom the Monitor, in its sole discretion, may determine to
include in any plan for distribution of any Restitution Obligation payments. The
Defendants shall execute any documents necessary to release funds that they have in any
repository, bank, investment or other financial institution, wherever located, in order to
make partial or total payment toward the Restitution Obligation;

8. that the Monitor shall provide the Commission at the beginning of each calendar
year with a report detailing the disbursement of funds to the defendantsâ customers
during the previous year. The Monitor shall transmit this report under a cover letter that
identifies the name and docket number of this proceeding to the Chief Financial Officer,
CFTC, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20581;

9. that the amounts payable to each customer shall not limit the ability of any
customer from proving that a greater amount is owed from the Defendants or any other
person or entity, and nothing herein shall be construed in any way to limit or abridge the
rights of any customer that exist under state or common law;

10. that pursuant to Rule 71, each customer of the Defendants who suffered a loss is
explicitly made an intended third-party beneficiary of this Order and may seek to enforce
obedience of this Order to obtain satisfaction of any portion of the Restitution Obligation
that has not been paid by the Defendants, to ensure continued compliance with any
provision of this Order and to hold the Defendants in contempt for any violations of any
provision of this Order;

11. that to the extent that any funds accrue to the U.S. Treasury for satisfaction of the
Defendantsâ Restitution Obligation, such funds shall be transferred to the Monitor for
disbursement in accordance with the procedures set forth above;

12. that the Defendants shall pay, jointly and severally, a CMP in the amount of
$2,486,619.87 (âCMP Obligationâ), plus post-judgment interest. Post-judgment interest

9

Case 5:14-cv-00083-F Document 37 Filed 08/14/15 Page 9 of 11
 

shall accrue on the CMP Obligation beginning on the date of entry of this Order and shall
be determined by using the Treasury Bill rate prevailing on the date of entry of this
Order, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1961 (2012);

13, that the Defendants shall pay their CMP Obligation by electronic funds transfer,
U.S. postal money order, certified check, bank cashierâs check, or bank money order. If
payment is to be made other than by electronic funds transfer, then the payment shall be
made payable to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and sent to the address

of the cover letter and the form of payment to the Chief Financial Officer, CFTC, Three

14. that Acceptance by the Commission or the Monitor of any partial payment of the
defendantsâ Restitution Obligation or CMP Obligation shall not be deemed a waiver of
their obligation to make further payments pursuant to this Order, or a waiver of the
Commissionâs right to seek to compel payment of any remaining balance;

Federal Court in North Carolina Enters Judgment against Ron Earl McCullough and David
Christopher Mayhew in Foreign Currency Ponzi Scheme

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) announced that Senior Judge James C. Fox
of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina entered a default judgment Order against Defendants
Ron Earl McCullough and David Christopher Mayhew, both from Raleigh, North Carolina. The Order requires
McCullough and Mayhew jointly to pay $1,223,388.43 in restitution and a $2,486,619.87 civil monetary penalty. The
Order also enters a permanent injunction that imposes permanent trading and registration bans against the Defendants
and prohibits them from violating the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC regulations, as charged.

The Courtâs Order stems from a CFTC Complaint filed on February 18, 2014 against McCullough and Mayhew (see
Complaint and CFTC Press Release 6860-14).

In the Order, the Court found that, from approximately December 2008 to January 2012, McCullough and Mayhew
operated a fraudulent scheme that solicited approximately $2.3 million from at least 11 members of the public to trade
leveraged or margined off-exchange foreign currency contracts. The Court also found that McCullough and Mayhew
misrepresented their trading record, used some customer funds to repay other customers in the manner of a Ponzi
scheme, and misappropriated more than $1.6 million from their customers, including $829,000 for their personal use.

CFTC Earlier Issued an Administrative Order against Travis Cox, a Partner of McCullough and Mayhew

In a separate but related matter, on February 19, 2014, the CFTC issued an Administrative Order against Travis Maurice
Cox also from Raleigh, North Carolina, that sets forth Coxâs fraudulent conduct in connection with his solicitations on
behalf of his forex trading partners, McCullough and Mayhew (see Administrative Order and CFTC Press Release 6860-
14). The CFTC Order found that Cox misrepresented the results of McCullough and Mayhewâs trading on his behalf and
misappropriated approximately $114,000 of his customersâ funds. The Order also required Cox to pay restitution of
$1,306,010.95 to his defrauded customers and a $330,000 civil monetary penalty.

Related Criminal Action

In a related criminal action, on June 12, 2015, a jury found Mayhew guilty of one count of conspiracy, ten counts of wire
fraud, four counts of mail fraud, and three counts of unlawful monetary transactions (see United States v. Mayhew, No.
13-cr-199 (E.D.N.C.)). The Court has scheduled Mayhewâs sentencing hearing for September 28, 2015. The grand jury
also indicted McCullough, but McCullough is currently a fugitive.

The CFTC cautions victims that restitution orders may not result in the recovery of money lost because the wrongdoers
may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers, and to
ensure that persons who violate the CEA by committing fraud are held accountable.

The CFTC thanks the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Eastern District of North Carolina, the Federal Bureau of Investigation,
the Internal Revenue Service, and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service for their assistance.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Glenn Chernigoff, Maura Viehmeyer, James H.
Holl, lll, Rick Glaser, and Gretchen L. Lowe.

PLAINTIFF'S EX PARTE
EMERGENCY MOTION FOR
STATUTORY RESTRAINING
ORDER, EXPEDITED
DISCOVERY, ORDER TO
SHOW CAUSE REGARDING
PRELIMINARY
INJUNCTION, AND OTHER
EQUITABL RELIEF

Plaintiff, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ), has

filed a Complaint for Permanent Injunction and Other Relief and moved, pursuant

to Section 6c(a) of the Commodity Exchange Act (the âActâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(a)

(2012), for an ex parte statutory restraining order freezing assets, and ordering

Defendant to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not be issued. The

Court has considered the pleadings, declarations, exhibits, and memorandum filed

in support of the Commissionâs request for a statutory restraining order, and finds

that:

1. This Court has jurisdiction over the parties and over the subject matter

of this action pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2012).

Case 3:15-cv-00828 Document il Filed 08/25/15 Page 1 of 15 Pageib # 498
2. Venue lies properly within this District pursuant to Section 6c(e) of
the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§13a-1(e) (2012).

3. There is good cause to believe that Maverick Asset Management,
LLC (âMAMâ), Rodney Scott Phelps (âPhelpsâ) and Jason T. Castenir
(âCastenirâ) (collectively, âDefendantsâ), have engaged in, are engaging in and are
about to engage in acts in violation of 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6b(a)(1)(A)-(C), 60(1), 6m(1)
and 6k(2) (2012), and 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 4.20(b)-(c) (2014).

4. From approximately March 1, 2013 through the present (the
âRelevant Periodâ), Defendants Maverick Asset Management, LLC (âMAMâ), by
and through its employees Rodney Scott Phelps (âPhelpsâ) and Jason T. Castenir
(âCastenirâ), and Phelps and Castenir directly (collectively, âDefendantsâ)
defrauded at least two members of the public (âpool participantsâ) out of
approximately $1.2 million in connection with pooled investments in exchange-
traded commodity futures contracts. During the Relevant Period, Defendants
misappropriated over $800,000 of their pool participantsâ funds, made material
misrepresentations and omissions to existing and prospective pool participants,
provided pool participants with false account statements, and operated the pool
illegally. There is good cause to believe that immediate and irreparable damage to
the Courtâs ability to grant effective final relief for pool participants in the form of

monetary redress will occur from the sale, transfer, assignment, or other

2
Mase 3:15-cv-00828 Document il Filed O8/25/15 Page 2 of 15 PagelD & 499
disposition by Defendant of assets or records unless Defendants are immediately
restrained and enjoined by Order of the Court.

5. There is good cause for the Court to freeze assets owned, controlled,
managed, or held by or on behalf of, or for the benefit of Defendants, including
assets in accounts held by Maverick Investment Holdings, LLC (âMIHâ).

6. There is good cause for entry of an order prohibiting Defendants, their
agents, servants, employees, assigns, attorneys, and persons in active concert or
participation with Defendants, including any successor thereof, from destroying
records and/or denying agents of the Commission access to inspect and copy
records to ensure that Commission representatives have immediate and complete
access to those books and records.

7. There is good cause for the Plaintiff to conduct expedited discovery in
order to determine the full extent of Defendantsâ alleged wrongdoing, locate
Defendantsâ other pool participants, identify pool participant funds and other assets
of Defendants and clarify the source and whereabouts of various funds.

8. Absent the entry of this statutory restraining order, Defendants are
likely to dissipate or transfer assets and destroy business records.

9. This is a proper case for granting an ex parte statutory restraining

order to preserve the status quo, protect pool participants from loss and damage,

CFTC Charges Tennessee and Kentucky Residents Rodney Scott Phelps and Jason T.
Castenir and Their Company, Maverick Asset Management, LLC, with Commodity Pool
Fraud and Other Violations

Federal Court Issues Emergency Order Freezing Assets and Protecting
Books and Records

Washington, DC âThe U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced that Chief Judge Kevin H.
Sharp of the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee issued an emergency Order freezing and preserving
any remaining pool participant assets under the control of Maverick Asset Management, LLC, Rodney Scott Phelps,
and Jason T. Castenir (Defendants) and another company that they control, Maverick Investment Holdings, LLC.
The Order, entered under seal on August 25, 2015, also prohibits the Defendants from destroying books and records and
grants the CFTC immediate access to those records.

The Order arises out of a civil enforcement Complaint filed under seal by the CFTC on August 25, 2015, charging the
Defendants with fraudulently soliciting at least $1.2 million from members of the public to trade commodity futures in a
pool, misappropriating more than $800,000 of pool participantsâ funds for their personal use, and misrepresenting the
profitability of their trading. In addition to fraud, the Complaint charges the Defendants with operating a commodity pool
without being registered with the CFTC, as required.

The Complaint further alleges that the Defendants prepared and distributed to pool participants false account statements
that altered genuine statements the Defendants received from their futures broker, and that showed false profits, while,
at the same time, the Defendantsâ futures trading was consistently unprofitable.

In its continuing litigation, the CFTC seeks full restitution to defrauded pool participants, disgorgement of any ill-gotten
gains, the payment of monetary penalties, permanent registration and trading bans, and a permanent injunction from
future violations of federal commodities laws, as charged.

The CFTC appreciates the cooperation of the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Middle District of Tennessee.

CFTC Division Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Glenn Chernigoff, Alison Wilson, Michael Loconte,
Erica Bodin, Rick Glaser, and former Division staff member Stephen Barrows.

Respondent.

 

ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTIONS 6(c) and 6(d) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, MAKING
FINDINGS AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

I.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ) has reason to believe that
from April 1, 2013, to July 10, 2013 (the âRelevant Periodâ), Forex Capital Markets, LLC
(âRespondentâ) violated Sections 4g and 6(c) of the Commodity Exchange Act (the âActââ) and
Commission Regulations (âRegulationsâ). Therefore, the Commission deems it appropriate and
in the public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted to
determine whether Respondent has engaged in the violations as set forth herein and to determine
whether any order should be issued imposing remedial sanctions.

IL.

In anticipation of the institution of this administrative proceeding, Respondent has
submitted an Offer of Settlement (âOfferâ), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Without admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, Respondent consents to
the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 6(c) and 6(d) of the
Commodity Exchange Act, Making Findings and Imposing Remedial! Sanctions (âOrderâ) and
acknowledges service of this Order.!

 

Respondent consents to the entry of this Order, and the use of these findings in this
proceeding and in any other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission
is a party provided, however, that Respondent does not consent to the use of the Offer, or the
findings or conclusions consented to in this Order, as the sole basis for any other proceeding
brought by the Commission, other than in a proceeding in bankruptcy or to enforce the terms of
this Order, Nor does Respondent consent to the use of the Offer or this Order, or the findings or
conclusions consented to in the Offer or this Order, by any other party in any other proceeding.

 
Ii.
The Commission finds the following:
A. | SUMMARY

During the Relevant Period Respondent failed to diligently supervise certain of its
officersâ, employeesâ, and agentsâ handling of accounts held at Respondent in the name of a
fraudulent foreign currency exchange (âforexâ) pool, Revelation Forex Fund, LP (âRFFâ), in
violation of Regulation 166.3, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 166.3 (2014). Specifically, Respondentâs officers,
employees, and agents failed to follow Respondentâs compliance procedures by: (1) failing to
provide adequate oversight of RFFâs accounts; and (2) failing to notify appropriate authorities of
certain activities associated with those accounts. Ultimately, RFF suffered a multi-million dollar
loss as a result of the fraud perpetrated by the operators of RFF, Kevin G. White (âWhiteâ), RFF
GP, LLC, and KGW Capital Management, LLC (collectively, the âWhite Entitiesâ).â

Further, during the Division of Enforcementâs (âDivisionâ) investigation of RFF,
Respondent failed to respond fully to a Commission document request in violation of Section 4g
of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6g 2012), and Regulations 1.31 and 1.35, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1.31 and 1.35
(2014). Respondentâs violation of Section 4g of the Act also violated a previous Commission
order in violation of Section 6(c) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 9 (2012).

| i&B. RESPONDENT

Forex Capital Markets, LLC is a registered futures commission merchant (âFCMâ) and
Retail Foreign Exchange Dealer headquartered at 55 Water Street, 50th Floor, New York, NY.

C, FACTS

1. The Commission Brought a Fraud Action Against White and the White
Entities, and White Was Also Prosecuted Criminally

On July 9, 2013, the Commission filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the
Eastern District of Texas (âComplaintâ) that charged White and the White Entities with
fraudulently soliciting approximately $7.4 million from over 20 participants in a forex pooled
investment vehicle and purported hedge fund, RFF, as well as misappropriating approximately
$1.7 million of pool participantsâ funds in violation of Sections 4b(a)(2)(A) and (C) and 40(1)(A)
and (B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6b(a)(2)(A) and (C) and 40(1)(A) and (B) (2012), CFTC v. RFF
GP, LLC et al., No. 4:13-cv-382-RAS-DDB (E.D., Tex.). Specifically, the Complaint alleged
that while acting as the controlling person of the White Entities, which operated the RFF pool,
White misrepresented RFFâs profitability through solicitations showing highly exaggerated
annual returns and growth rates for RFF, when in actuality, RFF was unprofitable. The
Complaint further alleged that White misrepresented his investment experience and

 

? The RFF accounts generated $143,922.50 to Respondent in commissions and fees during

the period in which Respondent serviced them â July 2011 through July 2013.

 
misappropriated funds for personal use.â Subsequently, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern
District of Texas charged White with mail fraud. United States v. White, No. 4:13-cr-00258-
RAS-DDB (E.D. Tex.). White pled guilty to the criminal charge and was subsequently
sentenced to eight years in prison.""

2. Respondent Failed to Supervise Diligently The Handling of RFFâs
Accounts by Its Officers, Employees, and Agents

Respondentâs compliance procedures require that Respondent âknow all of its customersâ
and that its employees with the potential to do so identify, and promptly report to appropriate
authorities, suspicious activities. During the Relevant Period, Respondentâs Account Services
Team (âAccount Services Teamâ), which handled the RFF account, and Respondentâs
Compliance Department (âComplianceâ) failed to follow Respondentâs compliance procedures
by failing to identify certain suspicious activities by White and by failing to promptly report
these activities to appropriate authorities.

White posted false claims of RFFâs profitable performance on two websites that he
controlled, www.revelationforex.com and www.kgweapital.com (collectively, âwebsitesâ).
During the Relevant Period, Compliance reviewed these websites on at least three occasions yet
failed to identify or report Whiteâs false claims of RFFâs profitable performance. Further, during
the Relevant Period, Compliance failed to identify or report that Whiteâs operation of the
websites on behalf of the White Entities violated their exemption from registering as a
commodity pool operator, for which White previously filed a notice pursuant to Regulation
4,.13(a)(3), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 4.13(a)(3) (2014). Compliance failed to flag during the Relevant Period
that while operating the RFF pool under this exemption, White was proscribed from advertising
in connection with the pool by Regulation 4.13(a)(3), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 4.13(a)(3) (2014).

During the Relevant Period, Compliance also became aware of statements posted in an
online forex trading forum alleging that White made several fraudulent claims regarding RFFâs
profitability ata Las Vegas tradeshow event, the âMoneyShow.â However, Compliance failed to
investigate or report these statements to appropriate authorities,

Finally, during the Relevant Period, the Account Services Team and Compliance failed to
identify or report that the margin requirements and net notional value of RFFâs positions
regularly far exceeded those permissible under Whiteâs claimed exemption for operating the RFF
pool under Regulation 4.13(a)(3),

 

; As the controlling person of the White Entities, White was responsible for the operation

of the RFF pool and was Respondentâs sole point of contact relative to RFF,

4 On March 30, 2015, the court in the Commissionâs case against White and the White

Entities entered a Consent Order for permanent injunction against defendants. The Consent
Order ordered them to pay a $4,150,000 civil monetary penalty and $3,365,888 in restitution. It
also imposed permanent registration and trading bans.

 
3. Respondentâs failure to respond fully to a Commission document request

On April 10, 2013, the Division sent a request for documents to Respondent pursuant to
Section 4g of the Act (âSection 4g requestâ) seeking, among other documents, all emails
between Respondent and White. Respondent responded to the Section 4g request on April 12,
2013, and later supplemented its response. Certain emails between Respondent and White
inadvertently were omitted from those responses, On February 11, 2014, Respondent produced
all of the inadvertently omitted emails in response to a Division subpoena duces tecum.

4. Respondentâs failure to comply with a previous Commission order

On October 3, 2011, the Commission ordered Respondent to cease and desist from
violating Section 4g and Regulation 1.35 due to Respondentâs previous failure to promptly
produce documents in response to a Commission document request. See In re Forex Capital
Markets, LLC, [2012-2013 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) 4 32,658 (CFTC Oct. 3,
2011) âOctober 3, 2011 Orderâ), As discussed above, Respondent subsequently failed to
respond fully to a Commission document request.

IV. LEGAL DISCUSSION

A, Respondent Failed to Supervise Diligently Its Officers, Employees, and
Agents Responsible for Handling RFFâs Accounts

Regulation 166.3, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 166.3 (2014), requires that every Commission registrant
(except associated persons who have no supervisory duties) diligently supervise the handling by
its officers, employees, and agents of all activities relating to its business as a registrant.
Regulation 166.3 imposes upon registrants an affirmative duty to diligently supervise their
employees and agents by establishing, implementing, and executing an adequate supervisory
structure and compliance programs. In order to prove a violation of Regulation 166.3, the
Commission must demonstrate that either: (1) the registrantâs supervisory system was generally
inadequate; or (2) the registrant failed to perform its supervisory duties diligently. See In re
Murlas Commodities, Inc., [1994-1996 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) { 26,485, at
43,161 (CFTC Sept. 1, 1995); In re Paragon Futures Assoc., [1990-1992 Transfer Binder]
Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) Â¥ 25,266, at 38,850 (CFTC Apr. 1, 1992), Evidence of violations
that âshould be detected by a diligent system of supervision, either because of the nature of the
violations or because the violations have occurred repeatedlyâ is probative of a failure to
supervise. Paragon Futures, Comm, Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) J 25,266, at 38,850.

As discussed above, Respondentâs lack of diligence in administering its supervisory
system during the Relevant Period caused Respondentâs violations of its compliance procedures,
By such acts, Respondent violated Regulation 166,3, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 166.3 (2014).

B. Respondent Failed to Respond Fully to a Commission Document Request

Section 4g of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6g (2012), requires FCMs, among other registrants, to
maintain books and records pertaining to certain âtransactions and positions in such form and
manner and for such period as may be required by the Commissionâ and to âkeep such books

 
and records open to inspection by any representative of the Commission.â The Regulations
further elaborate that FCMs, among other registrants, must promptly provide required books and
records to a Commission representative upon the representativeâs request. Regulations 1.31 and
1.35, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1.31 and 1.35 (2014); see also Forex Capital Markets, LLC, Comm. Fut. L.
Rep. (CCH) { 32,658 (CFTC Oct. 3, 2011) (holding that Respondent violated Section 4g of the
Act and Regulation 1.35 by failing to produce promptly certain records sought in 4g requests).
A violation of these record-keeping regulations does not require scienter. See In re DiPlacido,
[2003-2004 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. 4 29,866, at 56,590 (CFTC Sept. 14, 2004);
see also Inre GNP Commodities Inc., [1990-1992 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH)
{ 25,360, at 39,214 (CFTC Aug. 11, 1992); In re Buckwalter, [1990-1992 Transfer Binder]
Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) 4 24,995, at 37,687 (CFTC Jan. 25, 1991),

The facts surrounding Respondentâs production of documents show that Respondent
violated Section 4g of the Act, 7 U.S.C, Â§ 6g (2012), and Regulations 1.31 and 1.35, 17 C.F.R.
Â§Â§ 1.31 and 1.35 (2014), because it did not respond fully to the Divisionâs Section 4g request.
As discussed above, Respondent did not produce certain emails until February 11, 2014, after it
was subpoenaed by the Division. Accordingly, Respondent failed to comply fully with the
Divisionâs Section 4g request.

C. Respondent Violated the Commissionâs October 3, 2011 Order by Failing to
Respond Fully to a Commission Document Request

Pursuant to Section 6(c)(4) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 9(c)(4) (2012):

If the Commission has reason to believe that any person... is
violating or has violated this subsection, or any other provision of
this Act (including any rule, regulation, or order of the
Commission promulgated in accordance with this subsection or
any other provision of this Act), the Commission may serve upon
the person a complaint,

The Commission has relied upon this section of the Act and its predecessor in instituting
administrative procedures for violating a Commission order, See In re Newedge USA, LLC,
[2012-2013 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. 33,206 (CFTC Jan. 9, 2012) (finding that an
FCMâs violation of a Commission order constituted a violation of Section 6(c)) (citing Jn re
Grossfeld, [1990-1992 Transfer Binder] Comm, Fut, L. Rep. (CCH) 4 25,726, at 40,367 (CFTC
May 20, 1993) (affirming an administrative law judgeâs determination that a failure to comply
with a Commission order amounted to a violation of a Section 6(c)âs predecessor, Section 6(b));
Lawrence v. CFTC, 759 F.2d 767, 771 (9th Cir. 1985) (finding that a Respondentâs failure to pay
a civil monetary penalty assessed by the Commission in an administrative enforcement action
constituted a violation of a Commission order)); see also CFTC y, Gibraltar Monetary Corp.,
Inc., No. 04-80132-CIV, 2006 WL 1789018, at *23 (S.D. Fla. May 30, 2006) (finding that
Defendantsâ violation of a Commission order in committing options fraud also violated Section
6(c)) (citing Lawrence 759 F.2d at 771).

The Commissionâs October 3, 2011 Order directed Respondent to cease and desist from
violating Section 4g of the Act and Regulation 1.35. Respondent violated the October 3, 2011

 
Order by subsequently violating Section 4g of the Act and Regulation 1.35 by failing to respond
fully to a Commission document request. This failure constituted a violation of a Commission
order and Section 6(c) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 9 (2012).

Vv. FINDINGS OF VIOLATIONS

Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that, during the Relevant Period,
Respondent: (1) failed to adequately supervise its officers, employees, and agents in violation of
Regulation 166.3, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 166.3 (2014); (2) failed to respond accurately and completely to a
Commission document request in violation of Section 4g of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6g (2012), and
Regulations 1.31 and 1.35, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1.31 and 1.35 (2014); and (3) violated the October 3,
2011 Order and thereby violated Section 6(c) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 9 (2012).

CFTC Orders Forex Capital Markets, LLC to Pay More Than $843,000 for Supervision and
Record-Production Violations and for Violating a Previous Commission Order

Washington, DC â The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today filed and simultaneously settled
charges against Forex Capital Markets, LLC (FXCM), a registered Futures Commission Merchant, for failing to diligently
supervise its officersâ, employeesâ, and agentsâ handling of accounts held at FXCM in the name of a fraudulent foreign
currency exchange pool, Revelation Forex Fund, LP (RFF). RFF was operated by Kevin G. White (White) and two
entities he controlled (the White Entities).

The CFTC sued White and the White Entities on July 9, 2013, for their fraudulent scheme (see CFTC Press Release 6644-
13, July 12, 2013) and subsequently entered into a Consent Order for permanent injunction against them (see CFTC Press
Release 7151-15, April 6, 2015). In a related criminal action, White was sentenced to over eight years of prison for mail
fraud (see CFTC Press Release 7127-15, February 26, 2015).

According to the CFTCâs Order, from April 1, 2013, to July 10, 2013, FXCM failed to follow its compliance procedures that
require that it âknow all of its customersâ and that its employees identify and promptly report suspicious activities to
appropriate authorities. Although FXCM was aware of warning signs that RFF was a fraud, FXCM failed to identify or
report these warning signs in violation of its own compliance procedures, or that Whiteâs operation of websites on behalf
of the White Entities violated their exemption from registering as a commodity pool operator. The Order also finds that
FXCM failed to respond fully to a CFTC document request and, in doing so, violated a previous Commission order.

The CFTC Order requires FXCM to pay a civil monetary penalty of $700,000; disgorge commissions and fees of
$143,922.50 it earned from the RFF accounts; and comply with certain undertakings including hiring a third-party
compliance consultant to review and report on the supervisory issues raised in the Order.

The CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Harry E. Wedewer, Dmitriy Vilenskiy, John
Einstman, and Paul G. Hayeck.

Commodity Pool Operator Sentenced to 17 Yearsâ Incarceration for Fraud

Washington, DC â Donovan Davis Jr., one of three Principal Defendants charged by the CFTC for the fraudulent
operation of Capital Blu Management, LLC of Melbourne, Florida, was sentenced to 17 years in a federal prison on
August 27, 2015.

Davis was convicted on May 14, 2015 of multiple counts of criminal conspiracy, mail fraud, wire fraud, and money
laundering in connection with the operation of a fraudulent $17 million commodity pool. The two other Co-Defendants in
the CFTC action, Blayne Davis and Damien Bromfield, earlier pleaded guilty to similar criminal charges. B. Davis was
sentenced to 9 years in prison; Bromfieldâs sentencing is scheduled for September 24.

CFTC Enforcement Director, Aitan Goelman, said âThese sentences serve as a strong reminder that those who engage in
fraud in the commodities markets face the very real possibility of criminal prosecution and jail time in addition to the civil
sanctions sought by the CFTC.â

In 2011, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida found these same Defendants liable for civil violations of
the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC Regulations and ordered them to pay more than $7 million each in restitution
and civil monetary penalties and permanently barred them from engaging in any commodity-related activity (see CFTC
Press Release, Order, and Judgment 6054-11, June 15, 2011, and CFTC Press Release and Complaint 5643-09, April 7,
2009).

The CFTC subsequently provided material assistance to the U.S. Attorneyâs office responsible for the criminal prosecution
of these Defendants.

TRADING COMMISSION,
Plaintiff, COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND
OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF AND FOR
v. CIVIL MONETARY PENALTIES UNDER
THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT
THE TULVING COMPANY, INC, and AND COMMISSION REGULATIONS
HANNES TULVING, JR.,
Defendants.
I.
INTRODUCTION
l. From in or about August 2013 through in or about January 2014 (âRelevant

Periodâ), Hannes Tulving, Jr. (âTulvingâ), through his company, The Tulving Company, Inc.
(âTulving Companyâ) engaged in a fraudulent scheme to obtain funds from the public and
misappropriate those funds. As part of their scheme, Tulving and Tulving Company fraudulently
offered contracts of sale of commodities in interstate commerce; namely, contracts for the sale of
gold, silver, platinum, and palladium bullion and coin (âprectous metalsâ).

2. During the Relevant Period, Defendants obtained at least $17.8 million from at
least 381 customers located throughout the United States for the purchase and sale of precious
metals. Defendants purchased and sold little or no precious metals with the funds they collected
from customers. Instead, Defendants defrauded investors by lying to them and misappropriating

their funds.

Case 3:15-cv-00424 Document1 Filed 09/11/15 Page 1 of 13
3. Defendants attempted to conceal their fraud by making false and/or deceptive
statements. Defendants falsely represented that: (1) investors owned specific amounts of
precious metals when, in fact, they did not; (2) investors holdings in precious metals had
significant value when, in fact, the non-existent holdings had no value whatsoever; and (3)
investors were realizing profits from their investments when, in fact, no profit whatsoever had
been realized.

4. Defendants have engaged, are engaging, or are about to engage in fraudulent acts
and practices in violation of the Commodity Exchange Act (âActâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ | et seg. (2012),
and the Regulations (âRegulationsâ) promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.1 ef seg. (2013).
Specifically, Defendants have violated the antifraud provisions of Section 6(c)(|) of the Act, 7
U.S.C. Â§Â§ 9, 15 (2012), and Regulation 180.1(a), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 180.1(a) (2013).

5. Accordingly, pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ I3a-1 (2012), the U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCFTCâ) brings this action to enjoin such acts and
practices and compel compliance with the Act. In addition, the CFTC seeks civil monetary
penalties and remedial ancillary relief, including, but not limited to, trading and registration bans,
restitution, disgorgement, rescission, post-judgment interest, and such other relief as the Court
may deem necessary and appropriate.

6. Unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, Defendants are likely to continue to
engage in the acts and practices alleged in this Complaint and similar acts and practices, as more

fully described bclow.

II.
JURISDICTION AND VENUE

7. Jurisdiction. This Court possesses jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section
6c of the Act, as amended, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2012), which authorizes the CFTC to seek
injunctive and other relief against any person whenever it shall appear to the CFTC that such
person has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a
violation of any provision of the Act or any rule, regulation, or order thereunder.

8. Nenue. Venue properly lies with the Court pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act,
7 ULS.C. Â§ 13a-1(e) (2012), because Defendants are found in, inhabit, or transact business in the
Western District of North Carolina, and the acts and practices in violation of the Act occurred,

are occurring, or are about to occur, within this District.

FACTS ESTABLISHING DEFENDANTSâ VIOLATIONS
OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT

A. Defendants Offered Contracts of Sale of Commodities in Interstate Commerce

13. During the Relevant Period, Tulving, by and through Tulving Company, obtained
at least $17.8 million from customers for the purpose of entering into contracts of sale of gold,
silver, platinum, and palladium in interstate commerce.

14. Under Section 1(a)(9) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1(a)(9) (2012), gold, silver,
platinum, and palladium are statutorily-defined commodities.

15. As part of their fraud, Defendants used the mails or other instrumentalities of
interstate commerce to: (1) receive funds from and send funds to customers; (2) disseminate false
account documents to customers; and (3) send fictitious purchase and sale documents to
customers.

B. Defendants Fraudulently Solicited Customers by Making False and Misleading

Representations and/or Omitting Material Facts

16. | During the Relevant Period, Defendants represented to members of the public that
Tulving Company was a highly reputable precious metals firm that delivered precious metals to
customers. Tulving Company held itself out as a stable, established dealer in precious metals
through its website, www.tulving.com (âwebsiteâ). The website stated that, from 1999 through
March 30, 2013, Tulving Company bought and sold in excess of $2.1 billion in precious metals.
The website also represented that Tulving Company sold more than $350 million in precious

metals during 2012.

4

Case 3:15-cv-00424 Document1 Filed 09/11/15 Page 4 of 13
17. During the Relevant Period, the website represented Tulving Company purchased
and sold precious metals at particular prices. The website also stated that precious metals were
shipped quickly to customers after placement of orders and receipt of customer funds.
Specifically, the website represented: âGold, Platinum, and Palladium are typically shipped
within 72 working hours of receipt of your wire;â â[s]ilver is typically shipped within about 5
working days after receipt of your wire;â and items paid by check would be shipped within 14
working days. These representations were false.

18. The website provided instructions for customers to purchase metals by sending
funds to Tulving Company. Customers were instructed to send a check by mail to the address of
Tulving Company or wire funds to bank accounts in the name of Tulving Company. During the
Relevant Period, Defendants received at least $17.8 million for the purpose of purchasing and
selling precious metals.

19. During the Relevant Period, at least 381 persons from locations throughout the
United States, including North Carolina, submitted orders with Tulving Company for the
purchase of precious metals. During this time, Tulving, by and through Tulving Company,
received approximately $17.8 million from mai! and wire transfers from these persons to
purchase precious metals from Tulving Company.

20. During the Relevant Period, Defendants misrepresented confirmation of purchase
and sale transactions with Tulving Company customers. Defendants falsely represented to
customers that precious metals had been purchased after receipt of customer funds and that
precious metals had been shipped to customers. Defendants knew that their representations
regarding the purchase of precious metals were false because they did not purchase precious

metals on behalf of customers and misappropriated most, if not all, of the customer funds.

5

Case 3:15-cv-00424 Document1 Filed 09/11/15 Page 5 of 13
21. During the Relevant Period, Defendants failed to disclose, and omitted, that they
never purchased any precious metals on behalf of Tulving customers. Defendants also failed to
disclose, and omitted, that the Tulving customer funds would be misappropriated by Defendants
for purposes unrelated to the purchase and sale of precious metals including, but not limited to,

paying the personal expenses of Defendants.

22. During the Relevant Period, Defendants issued false financial statements to
customers. These statements: (1) misrepresented that Tulving Company customers owned
specific amounts of precious metals; (2) misstated the value of Tulving customer precious metals
purchases; (3) and falsely represented the profitability of Tulving customer purchases.

23. | Contrary to Defendantsâ false financial statements, none of the Tulving customers
actually owned any precious metals, let alone realized any profits from their precious metals
purchases because Defendants never actually purchased precious metals. Further, Defendants
financial statements failed to disclose, and omitted, that the funds from the Tulving Customers

would be misappropriated by Defendants.

D. Defendants Misappropriated Customer Funds

24. During the Relevant Period, Defendants misappropriated approximately $17.8
million of customer funds for improper and unauthorized uses.

25. During the Relevant Period, Defendants misappropriated customer funds for
Defendantsâ own financial benefit and for purposes unrelated to the purchase and sale of

precious metals.

Tulving solicited investors on behalf of Tulving Company and handled all customer funds
received by Tulving Company. Tulving was the sole shareholder and president of Tulving

CFTC Charges California Resident Hannes Tulving, Jr., through his company, The Tulving
Company, Inc., with Misappropriation and Fraudulent Solicitation in a $17.8 Million
Precious Metals Scheme

At Least 381 Customers Nationwide Allegedly Defrauded in the Scheme

Washington, DC â The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today filed a civil Complaint against
Defendants Hannes Tulving, Jr. of Newport Beach, California, and his company, The Tulving Company, Inc., charging
them with fraudulent solicitation and misappropriation in connection with the precious metals markets. Neither
Defendant has ever been registered with the CFTC.

In its enforcement action, the CFTC alleges that the Defendants fraudulently offered contracts of sale of commodities in
interstate commerce, namely, contracts for the sale of gold, silver, platinum, and palladium bullion and coin (precious
metals). In offering these contracts, the Defendants obtained and misappropriated at least $17.8 million from at least
381 customers located throughout the United States for the purchase and sale of precious metals, according to the
Complaint.

In their solicitations, the Defendants allegedly made false and fraudulent representations, including that The Tulving
Company was a highly reputable, stable, and established precious metals firm that delivered precious metals to
customers; that it bought and sold in excess of $2.1 billion in precious metals from 1999 through March 2013; and that
precious metals were shipped quickly to customers after placement of orders and receipt of customer funds. These
representations were false, according to the Complaint.

The Defendants allegedly purchased and sold little or no precious metals with the funds they collected from customers.
Instead, according to the Complaint, the Defendants defrauded customers by lying to them and misappropriating their
funds for improper and unauthorized uses, including for the Defendantsâ own financial benefit.

To conceal their fraud, according to the Complaint, the Defendants made false and/or deceptive statements, including
falsely representing that (1) customers owned specific amounts of precious metals when, in fact, they did not, (2)
customers holdings in precious metals had significant value when, in fact, the non-existent holdings had no value
whatsoever, and (3) customers were realizing profits from their investments when, in fact, no profit whatsoever had been
realized.

In its continuing litigation, the CFTC seeks restitution to defrauded customers, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, a civil
monetary penalty, permanent registration and trading bans, and a permanent injunction against future violations of
federal commodities laws, as charged.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Luke B. Marsh, Richard Foelber, Dmitriy
Vilensky, and Paul G. Hayeck.

Precious Metals Fraud Advisory, which alerts customers to precious metals fraud and lists simple ways to spot precious
metals scams.

ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTIONS 6(c) AND 6(d) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, MAKING
FINDINGS AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

I.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ) has reason to believe that
from in or about March 2014 to at least August 2014 (the âRelevant Periodâ), Coinflip, Inc.,
d/b/a Derivabit (âCoinflipâ) and Francisco Riordan (âRiordanâ) (the âRespondentsâ) violated
Sections 4c(b) and 5h(a)(1) of the Commodity Exchange Act, as amended (the âActâ), 7 U.S.C.
Â§Â§ 6c(b) and 7b-3(a)(1) (2012), and Commission Regulations 32.2 and 37.3(a)(1), 17 C.F.R. Â§
32.2 and 37.3(a)(1) (2014). Therefore, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public
interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted to determine
whether the Respondents engaged in the violations set forth herein and to determine whether any
order should be issued imposing remedial sanctions.

Il.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, the Respondents have
submitted an Offer of Settlement (âOfferâ), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Without admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, Respondents consent to
the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 6(c) and 6(d) of the
Commodity Exchange Act, Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (âOrderâ) and
acknowledge service of this Order.â

 

' Respondents consent to the entry of this Order and to the use of these findings in this proceeding and in any other
proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party; provided, however, that Respondents
do not consent to the use of the Offer, or the findings or conclusions in the Order consented to in the Offer, as the
sole basis for any other proceeding brought by the Commission, other than in a proceeding in bankruptcy or to
enforce the terms of this Order. Nor do Respondents consent to the use of the Offer or the Order, or the findings or
conclusions in this Order consented to in the Offer, by any other party in any other proceeding.
Il.

The Commission finds the following:

A, Summary

During the Relevant Period, Respondents violated Sections 4c(b) and Sh(a)(1) of the Act
and Commission Regulations 32.2 and 37.3(a)(1) by conducting activity related to commodity
options contrary to Commission Regulations and by operating a facility for the trading or
processing of swaps without being registered as a swap execution facility or designated contract
market. Specifically, during the Relevant Period, Respondents operated an online facility named
Derivabit, offering to connect buyers and sellers of Bitcoin option contracts.â

B. Respondents

Coinflip, Inc. is a Delaware corporation with a principal place of business in San
Francisco, California. During the Relevant period, Coinflip operated Derivabit and its website
derivabit.com. Coinflip has never been registered with the Commission.

Francisco Riordan is an individual residing in San Francisco, California, Riordan is a
founder, the chief executive officer, and controlling person of Coinflip. Riordan has never been
registered with the Commission.

Cc, Facts

Coinflip Conducted Activity Related to Illegal Commodity Options

Beginning in March 2014, Coinflip advertised Derivabit as a ârisk management platform
,.. that connects buyers and sellers of standardized Bitcoin options and futures contracts.â
During this period, Coinflip designated numerous put and call options contracts as eligible for
trading on the Derivabit platform.â For these contracts, Coinflip listed Bitcoin as the asset
underlying the option and denominated the strike and delivery prices in US Dollars. According
to the derivabit.com website, a customer could place orders by registering as a user and
depositing Bitcoin into an account in the userâs name. Premiums and payments of settlement of
the option contracts were to be paid using Bitcoin at a spot rate determined by a designated third-
party Bitcoin currency exchange. Users had the ability to, and in fact did, post bids or offers for

 

* Bitcoin is a âvirtual currency,â defined here as a digital representation of value that functions as a medium of
exchange, a unit of account, and/or a store of value, but does not have legal tender status in any jurisdiction. Bitcoin
and other virtual currencies are distinct from ârealâ currencies, which are the coin and paper money of the United
States or another country that are designated as legal tender, circulate, and are customarily used and accepted as a
medium of exchange in the country of issuance.

* Although referenced it its solicitation materials, Coinflip did not offer any futures contracts during the Relevant
Period.

 
the designated options contracts. Coinflip confirmed the bid or offer by communicating it to all
users through its website.*

During the Relevant Period, Derivabit had approximately 400 users.
Riordan Controlled Coinflip and Directed Its Operations

Riordan was the founder, engineer and Chief Executive Officer of Coinflip. He exercised
control over Coinflipâs daily operations and possessed the power or ability to control all aspects
of the Derivabit platform. Riordan participated in key aspects of Coinflipâs illegal activity,
including designing and implementing the Derivabit trading platform. Riordanâs control enabled
him to make design and substantive changes to Coinflipâs operations, including the transition
from offering Bitcoin options to OTC Bitcoin Forward Contracts. Ultimately, Riordan possessed
the power and ability to direct Coinflip to cease operating the Derivabit platform.

LEGAL DISCUSSION

A. Virtual Currencies Such as Bitcoin are Commodities

Section 1a(9) of the Act defines âcommodityâ to include, among other things, âall
services, rights, and interests in which contracts for future delivery are presently or in the future
dealt in.â 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1a(9). The definition of a âcommodityâ is broad, See, e.g., Board of Trade
of City of Chicago v. SEC, 677 F, 2d 1137, 1142 (7th Cir. 1982), Bitcoin and other virtual
currencies are encompassed in the definition and properly defined as commodities.

B. Coinflip Violated Sections 4c(b) Act and Commission Regulation 32.2

Section 4c(b) of the Act makes it unlawful for any person to âoffer to enter into, enter
into or confirm the execution of, any transaction involving any commodity ... which is of the
character of, or is commonly known to the trade as, an âoptionâ... , âbidâ, âofferâ, âputâ, [or]
âcallâ... contrary to any rule, regulation, or order of the Commission prohibiting any such
transaction.â Section 1,3(hh) defines a âcommodity option transactionâ and âcommodity optionâ
to âmean any transaction or agreement in interstate commerce which is or is held out to be of the
character of, or is commonly known to the trade as, an âoption,â âprivilege,â âindemnity,â âbid,â
âoffer,â âcall,â âput,â âadvance guaranty,â or âdecline guaranty,â and which is subject to regulation
under the Act and these regulations.â Section 32.2 of the Commissionâs Regulations, in turn,

 

âIn July 2014, Coinflip began to offer what it characterized as âOTC Bitcoin Forward Contractsâ for trading. Under
this model, a Derivabit user would be matched through competitive bidding with a counterparty to execute a
contract to exchange US Dollars for Bitcoins at a predetermined price and date. As part of its services, Coinflip
would calculate and hold initial and maintenance margin payments and would also calculate and facilitate the
transfer of final settlements at maturity or early termination. Coinflip advertised that the users could choose to
institute an early termination at any time if its position was âin the money.â Although the price would be expressed
as an exchange rate between US Dollars and Bitcoins, Coinflip required all settlements and margin payments to be
transacted in Bitcoins. No bids or offers were posted by Derivabit users for these contracts, Although these
activities may have violated, or led to violations of, the Commodity Exchange Act, the Commission does not
address this conduct here.

 
provides that it shall be unlawful for any person to âoffer to enter into, enter into, confirm the
execution of, maintain a position in, or otherwise conduct activity related to any transaction in
interstate commerce that is a commodity option transaction unless: (a) [s]uch transaction is
conducted in compliance with and subject to the provisions of the Act, including any
Commission rule, regulation, or order thereunder, otherwise applicable to any other swap, or (b)
[s]uch transaction is conducted pursuant to [Regulation] 32.3.â

Between at least March 2014 and July 2014, Respondents conducted activity related to
commodity option transactions, offered to enter into commodity option transactions and/or
confirmed the existence of commodity option transactions. The options transactions were not
conducted in compliance with Section 5h(a)(1) of the Act or Regulation 37.3(a)(1), a section of
the Act and a Commission regulation otherwise applicable to swaps (see infra Section C) and
were not conducted pursuant to Regulation 32.3.Â° Accordingly, Coinflip violated Section 4c(b)
of the Act and Commission Regulation 32.2,

OF Coinflip Violated Section Sh(a)(Q1) of the Act

Section 5h(a)(1) of the Act forbids any person from operating âa facility for the trading or
processing of swaps unless the facility is registered as a swap execution facility or as a
designated contract market... .â 7 U.S.C. Â§ 7b-3(a)(1). Section 1a(47) of the Actâs definition
of âswapâ includes option contracts, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1a(47)(A)(i). Regulation 37.3(a)(1) similarly
requires that any âperson operating a facility that offers a trading system or platform in which
more than one market participant has the ability to execute or trade swaps with more than one
other market participant on the system or platform shall register the facility as a swap execution
facility under this part or as a designated contract market under part 38 of this chapter.â 17
C.F.R. Â§ 37.3(a)(1) (2014).

During the Relevant Period, Coinflip operated a facility for the trading of swaps.
However, Coinflip did not register the facility as a swap execution facility or designated contract
market. Accordingly, Coinflip violated Section 5h(a)(1) of the Act and Regulation 37.3(a)(1).

D. Riordan Is Liable for Coinflipâs Violations as Its Controlling Person Under Section

13(b) of the Act

Riordan controlled Coinflip, directly or indirectly, and did not act in good faith or
knowingly induced, directly or indirectly, Coinflipâs acts in violation of the Act and Regulations;
therefore, pursuant to Section 13(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13c(b) (2012), Riordan is liable for
Coinflipâs violations of Sections 4c(b) and Sh(a)(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6c(b) and 7b-3(a)(1)
(2012) and Regulations 32.2 and 37.3(a)(1), 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 32.2 and 37,3(a)(1) (2014).

 

> To take advantage of the âtrade optionâ exemptions set forth in Regulation 32,3, the offeror of the option must be
an eligible contract participant as defined in Section la(18) of the Act or âproducer, processor, or commercial user
of, or a merchant handling the commodity,â and have a reasonable basis to believe that the offeree was a âproducer,
processor, or commercial user of, or a merchant handling the commodity that is the subject of the commodity option
transaction, or the products or by-products thereof, and such offeree is offered or entering into the commodity option
transaction solely for purposes related to its business as such.â 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 32.3(a)(1)(i)-Gi) and 32.3(a)(2).

 
IV.

FINDINGS OF VIOLATIONS

Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that, during the Relevant Period,
Respondents violated Sections 4c(b) and Sh(a)(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 4c(b) and 7b-3(a)(1)
(2012), and Commission Regulations 32.2 and 37.3(a)(1), 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 32.2 and 37.3(a)(1)

CFTC Orders Bitcoin Options Trading Platform Operator and its CEO to Cease Illegally
Offering Bitcoin Options and to Cease Operating a Facility for Trading or Processing of
Swaps without Registering

In First Action against an Unregistered Bitcoin Options Trading
Platform, CFTC Holds that Bitcoin and Other Virtual Currencies Are a
Commodity Covered by the Commodity Exchange Act

Washington, D.C. â The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today issued an Order filing and simultaneously
settling charges against Coinflip, Inc. d/b/a Derivabit (Coinflip) and its chief executive officer Francisco Riordan for
conducting activity related to commodity options transactions without complying with the Commodity Exchange Act
(CEA) and CFTC Regulations, specifically, by operating a facility for the trading or processing of commodity options
without complying with the CEA or CFTC Regulations otherwise applicable to swaps or conducting the activity pursuant to
the CFTCâs exemption for trade options. Coinflip is based in San Francisco, California, and Riordan resides in San
Francisco.

The Order finds that, from in or about March 2014 to at least August 2014, Coinflip and Riordan operated an online
facility named Derivabit, offering to connect buyers and sellers of Bitcoin option contracts.

The Order requires Coinflip and Riordan to cease and desist from further violations of the CEA and Regulations, as
charged, and to comply with specified undertakings.

Aitan Goelman, the CFTCâs Director of Enforcement, commented: âWhile there is a lot of excitement surrounding Bitcoin
and other virtual currencies, innovation does not excuse those acting in this space from following the same rules
applicable to all participants in the commodity derivatives markets.â

The CFTC Order finds that Coinflip designated put and call options for the delivery of Bitcoins as eligible for trading on the
Derivabit platform. Under Section 4c of the CEA and Part 32 of the CFTCâs Regulations, commodity option transactions
must either be conducted in compliance with provisions of the CEA or Regulations otherwise applicable to swaps, or
conducted pursuant to Regulation 32.3, the âtrade optionâ exemption. In the Order, the CFTC for the first time finds that
Bitcoin and other virtual currencies are properly defined as commodities. The Order further finds that the activities
related to commodity option transactions were not conducted in compliance with a provision of the CEA or a provision of
the Regulations otherwise applicable to swaps, and were not conducted pursuant to the Regulation 32.3 âtrade optionâ
exemption.

Additionally, the Order finds that Coinflip operated a facility for the trading of swaps but did not register the facility as a
Swap Execution Facility or Designated Contract Market, as required. The CEAâs definition of âswapâ includes option
contracts. Accordingly, Coinflip violated Section 5h(a)(1) of the CEA and Regulation 37.3(a)(1). Because Riordan
controlled Coinflip, directly or indirectly, and did not act in good faith or knowingly induced, directly or indirectly,
Coinflipâs acts in violation of the CEA and Regulations, Riordan is liable for all of Coinflipâs violations of the CEA and
Regulations, the Order finds.

Coinflip and Riordan cooperated with the Division of Enforcementâs investigation.

The Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this action are David W. Oakland, K. Brent Tomer, Lenel
Hickson, Jr., and Manal M. Sultan.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ) has reason to believe that

and his companies Phillips Investment & Trust LLC and Corporate I Communications &
Technology Inc. (collectively âRespondentsâ) violated Sections 4b(a)(1)(A)-(C) and
4o0(1)(A)-(B) of the Commodity Exchange Act (âCEAâ or âActâ), 7 U.S.C. 88 6b(1)(2)(A)-(C),
60(1)(A)-(B). Therefore, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest that
public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted to determine whether
Respondents engaged in the violations set forth herein and to determine whether any order
should be issued imposing remedial sanctions.

Il.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Respondents have
submitted an Offer of Settlement (âOfferâ), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Without admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, Respondents consent to
the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 6(c) and 6(d) of the
Commodity Exchange Act, Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (âOrderâ) and
acknowledge service of this Order.â

 

Respondents consent to the entry of this Order and to the use of these findings in this
proceeding and in any other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission
is a party; provided, however, that Respondents do not consent to the use of the Offer, or the
findings or conclusions in this Order consented to in the Offer, as the sole basis for any other
proceeding brought by the Commission, other than in a proceeding in bankruptcy or to enforce
III.
The Commission finds the following:
A. SUMMARY

From at least 2011 through 2014, Respondents fraudulently obtained at least $113,400
from numerous individual and entity investors for the purpose of trading commodity futures in a
designated contract market in violation of the CEA, misrepresenting to investors that Phillips had
achieved past success trading futures when he had never actually done so. Respondents
misappropriated a large portion of investorsâ funds for the personal use of Respondent Terry Lee
Phillips (âPhillipsâ), and misrepresented to investors that Phillips was achieving enormous
profits trading on their behalf when in fact he was either trading their funds for significant losses
or not trading at all. Most of the investorsâ funds have not been returned.

B. RESPONDENTS

Terry Lee Phillips is an individual residing in Indianapolis, Indiana. Phillips is the sole
principal and owner of Phillips Investment and CIC. Phillips has never been registered with the
Commission in any capacity.

Phillips Investment & Trust, Inc. (âPhillips Investmentâ) is a limited liability company
organized in Indiana on or about June 3, 2013. Phillips Investment has never been registered
with the Commission in any capacity.

Corporate I Communications & Technology Inc. (âCICâ) is a corporation organized in
Indiana on or about November 9, 2005. CIC has never been registered with the Commission in
any capacity,

C. FACTS

During the Relevant Period, Respondents solicited and accepted at least $113,400 from
13 individuals and entities for the purpose of trading commodity futures. Phillips misrepresented
to his investors that he had traded futures profitably in the past. In fact, Phillips knew that he had
never made any substantial profits trading futures.

Between 2003 and 2011, Phillips opened at least five separate futures trading accounts
with various futures commission merchants (ââFCMsâ). The accounts were opened in the names
of business entities Phillips owned, including CIC. Phillips used these accounts to trade futures
contracts, including, most often, the E-Mini Dow Futures contract (YM). His trading was
consistently unprofitable. In fact, there were only two calendar months â February 2004 and
April 2010 â in which Phillips avoided trading losses, netting less than $500 profit combined in
those two months. By contrast, between October 2013 and March 2014, when Phillips traded the

 

the terms of this Order. Nor do Respondents consent to the use of the Offer or this Order, or the
findings or conclusions in this Order consented to in the Offer, by any other party in any other
proceeding.

 
E-Mini Dow Futures contract in a sixth FCM account that he opened in the name of Phillips
Investment (the âPhillips Investment Trading Accountâ), Phillipsâ trading resulted in losses of
tens of thousands of dollars, most of which Phillips had obtained from various investors.
Examples of Respondentsâ conduct are described below.

In the fall of 2012, Phillips addressed an undergraduate college class at the invitation of
the instructor, who was acquainted with Phillips. Phillips described his business and day-trading
success to the class, inducing six students to give CIC cash and personal checks totaling $2,700,
and to sign contracts providing that Phillips would, through trading futures, generate profits of
$400 or more per student per day in exchange for a commission. Later, Phillips misrepresented
to the students that he had pooled their funds and generated tens of thousands of dollars in profits
trading on their behalf. In fact, Phillips did not actually engage in trading with their funds, and
was not making any other futures trading profits at that time.

Beginning in late 2012, the college instructor provided CIC and Phillips Investment with
a total of $33,200, which included funds from a church charity and a trust benefitting his elderly
mother. Phillips deposited most of these funds in the Phillips Investment Trading Account.
Phillips provided the college instructor with a fictitious account statement indicating he had
achieved large profits trading on the college instructorâs behalf. In reality, Phillips had lost a
large portion of the college instructorâs investment and was not making any futures trading
profits at the time.

In August 2013, six friends and acquaintances of Phillips, all Indiana or Illinois residents,
formed an Indiana limited liability company (the âLLC Investorâ) for the purpose of pooling
their funds so that Phillips could trade futures on their behalf. In September 2013, Phillips
Investment obtained $30,000 from the LLC Investor, some of which funds were deposited in the
Phillips Investment Trading Account. Phillips provided the LLC Investor with fictitious account
statements indicating that he had achieved large profits trading on the LLC Investorâs behalf.
However, Phillips was not making any futures trading profits and had lost much of the funds
provided by the LLC Investor.

Between August and December 2013, an Indiana resident acquainted with Phillips
provided Phillips Investment with a total of $35,000 for the purpose of trading futures. Some of
these funds were deposited in the Phillips Investment Trading Account. Phillips later provided
this individual with a fictitious account statement indicating that he had achieved tens of
thousands of dollars in profits. Phillips had lost a significant portion of this individualâs
investment and had not generated any profits trading futures.

In every instance where Phillips provided false reports of profits to investors, he knew
that his statements did not accurately reflect his trading performance. |

Most of the funds Respondents illegally obtained from their investorsâat least
$94,500-âhave not been returned to investors, despite many inquiries by investors and demands
for repayment.

 
IV.
LEGAL DISCUSSION

During the Relevant Period, in connection with commodity futures transactions made or
to be made for, on behalf of, or with investors who provided funds to Respondents for the
purpose of trading futures, Respondents cheated, defrauded or attempted to cheat or defraud such
investors, willfully made or caused to be made to such investors false reports or statements, or
willfully entered or caused to be entered for such investors false records, and willfully deceived
or attempted to deceive investors in regard to orders or contracts or the disposition or execution
of orders or contracts, or in regard to acts of agency performed by Respondents with respect to
orders or contracts for or with such investors, in violation of Section 4b(a)(1)(A)-(C) of the Act,
7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6b(a)(1)(A)-(C). Respondents did so by knowingly or recklessly misrepresenting
Phillipsâ prior trading history and Respondentsâ intentions with respect to funds received from
investors, by knowingly or recklessly distributing false account statements to investors, and by
misappropriating investorsâ funds.

During the Relevant Period, Respondents operated as unregistered commodity pool
operators (âCPOsâ), as defined in Section la(11)(A)G)() of the Act, in that they engaged in a
business that is in the nature of an investment trust, syndicate or similar form of enterprise, and
in connection therewith, solicited, accepted or received funds, securities, or other property from
others for the purpose of trading futures.â Sections 4o0(1)(A) and (B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.

Â§Â§ 60(1)(A)-(B), make it unlawful for a CPO to use the mails or any means or instrumentality of
interstate commerce, directly or indirectly, to employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud
any pool participant or prospective pool participant, or to engage in any transaction, practice, or
course of business that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any pool participant or prospective pool
participant. Unlike Sections 4b(a)(1) and 40(1)(A) of the Act, the language of Section 40(1)(B)
does not require âknowingâ or âwillfulâ conduct as a prerequisite for liability. Commodity Trend
Service, Inc. vy. CFTC, 233 F.3d 981, 993 (7th Cir. 2000). The same conduct that constitutes
violations of Section 4b(a)(1) of the Act, as described above, also constitutes violations of
Sections 40(1)(A) and (B) of the Act. See, e.g., CFTC v. Skorupskas, 605 F. Supp. 923, 932-33
(E.D. Mich. 1985). By their fraudulent actions during the Relevant Period, each Respondent,
through the use of the mails or other means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce, while
acting as a CPO, directly or indirectly employed a device, scheme, or artifice to defraud
investors, or engaged in transactions, practices or a course of business which operated as a fraud
or deceit upon such investors, in violation of Section 40(1)(A) and (B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.

Â§Â§ 60(1)(A)-(B).

In addition to Phillipsâ own violations of the Act, Phillips directly controlled Phillips
Investment and CIC and did not act in good faith or knowingly induced, directly or indirectly,
Phillips Investment and CICâs acts in violation of the Act. Therefore, pursuant to Section 13(b)
of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13c(b), Phillips is liable for Phillips Investment and CICâs violations of
Sections 4b(a)(1)(A)-(C) and 40(1)(A)-(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6b(a)(1)(A)-(C),

 

* To the extent that Respondents pooled less than $400,000, contributed by fewer than 15

participants, they may have been eligible for an exemption from registration as a CPO. See
Commission Regulation 4.13(a)(2), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 4.13(a)(2).

 
60(1)(A)-(B). Likewise, the acts, omissions, and failures of Phillips in violation of the Act, as
discussed above, occurred within the scope of his position as an official of Phillips Investment
and/or CIC; therefore, Phillips Investment and CIC are liable for Phillipsâ acts, omissions, and
failures in violation of the Act, pursuant to Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(a)(1)(B),
and Commission Regulation 1.2, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.2.

V.

ORDER

Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT:

A.

Respondents shall cease and desist from violating Sections 4b(a)(1)(A)-(C) and
40(1)(A)-(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6b(a)(1)(A)-(C), 60(1 )(A)-(B).

Phillips and Phillips Investment shall pay, jointly and severally, restitution in the amount
of seventy-nine thousand eight hundred dollars ($79,800), plus post-judgment interest,
within thirty (30) days of the date of entry of this Order. Phillips and CIC shall pay,
jointly and severally, additional restitution in the amount of fourteen thousand seven
hundred dollars ($14,700), plus post-judgment interest, within thirty (30) days of the date
of entry of this Order. In total, Respondents shall pay restitution in the amount of ninety-
four thousand five hundred dollars ($94,500), plus post-judgment interest, within thirty
(30) days of the date of entry of this Order (the âRestitution Obligationâ). Ifthe
Restitution Obligation is not paid in full within thirty (30) days of the date of entry of this
Order, then post-judgment interest shall accrue on the Restitution Obligation beginning
on the date of entry of this Order and shall be determined by using the Treasury Bill rate
prevailing on the date of entry of this Order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1961.

 
To effect payment by Respondents and the distribution of restitution to Respondentsâ
customers, the Commission appoints the NFA as âMonitor.â The Monitor shall collect
payments of the Restitution Obligation from Respondents and make distributions as set
forth below. Because the Monitor is not being specially compensated for these services,
and these services are outside the normal duties of the Monitor, it shall not be liable for
any action or inaction arising from its appointment as Monitor other than actions
involving fraud.

Respondents shall make their payments of the Restitution Obligation under this Order in
the name of the âTerry Lee Phillips Settlement Fundâ and shall send such payments by
electronic funds transfer, or U.S. postal money order, certified check, bank cashierâs
check, or bank money order to the Office of Administration, National Futures
Association, 300 South Riverside Plaza, Suite 1800, Chicago, Illinois 60606, under a
cover letter that identifies the paying Respondent and the name and docket number of this
proceeding. The paying Respondent shall simultaneously transmit copies of the cover
letter and the form of payment to the Chief Financial Officer, Commodity Futures
Trading Commission, Three Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street, NW, Washington, D.C.
20581.

The Monitor shall oversee Respondentsâ Restitution Obligation and shall have the
discretion to determine the manner of distribution of funds in an equitable fashion to the
Respondentsâ customers or may defer distribution until such time as the Monitor may
deem appropriate. In the event that the amount of payments of the Restitution Obligation
to the Monitor are of a de minimis nature such that the Monitor determines that the
administrative cost of making a restitution distribution is impractical, the Monitor may, in
its discretion, treat such restitution payments as civil monetary penalty payments, which
the Monitor shall forward to the Commission, as discussed below. To the extent any
funds accrue to the U.S. Treasury for satisfaction of Respondentsâ Restitution Obligation,
such funds shall be transferred to the Monitor for disbursement in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this Order,

Respondents shall pay, jointly and severally, a civil monetary penalty in the amount of
one hundred forty thousand dollars ($140,000) (âCMP Obligationâ), plus post-judgment
interest, within thirty (30) days of the date of the entry of this Order. If the CMP
Obligation is not paid in full within thirty (30) days of the date of entry of this Order,
then post-judgment interest shall accrue on the CMP Obligation beginning on the date of
entry of this Order and shall be determined by using the Treasury Bill rate prevailing on
the date of entry of this Order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1961,

Respondents shall pay the CMP Obligation by electronic funds transfer, U.S. postal
money order, certified check, bank cashierâs check, or bank money order. [f payment is
to be made other than by electronic funds transfer, then the payment shall be made
payable to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and sent to the address below:

CFTC Orders Indiana Resident Terry Lee Phillips and his Two Companies to Pay Restitution
and a Civil Monetary Penalty Totaling More than $234,000 for Fraud and Misappropriation

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today filed and simultaneously settled
charges against Terry Lee Phillips of Indianapolis, Indiana, and his two companies, Phillips Investment & Trust LLC
and Corporate | Communications & Technology Inc. (the Respondents), charging them with defrauding investors
who provided funds to Phillips to trade commodity futures in a designated contract market. In addition, none of the
Respondents has ever been registered with the CFTC, as required.

The CFTC Order requires the Respondents jointly to pay restitution to defrauded investors totaling $94,500 anda
$140,000 civil monetary penalty. The Order further imposes permanent registration bans on all Respondents, permanent
trading bans on the two business-entity Respondents, and a five-year trading ban on Phillips. Respondents are also
required to cease and desist from further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act, as charged.

The Order finds that from at least 2011 through 2014, the Respondents fraudulently obtained at least $113,400 from 13
individuals and entity investors to trade commodity futures. The Order also finds that Respondents misappropriated a
large portion of investorsâ funds for Phillipsâ personal use, and misrepresented to investors â through fictitious account
statements and otherwise â that Phillips was achieving enormous profits trading on their behalf, when in fact he was
either using their funds to trade the E-Mini Dow Futures contract for significant losses or else not trading at all. Despite
many inquiries by investors and demands for repayment, most of the funds Respondents illegally obtained from their
investors â at least $94,500 â have not been returned to investors, the Order finds.

The CFTC thanks and acknowledges the assistance of the Securities Division of the Office of the Indiana Secretary of
State.

The CFTC cautions victims that restitution orders may not result in the recovery of money lost because the wrongdoers
may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers and to
ensure the wrongdoers are held accountable.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are David C. Newman, W. Derek Shakabpa, Trevor
Kokal, K. Brent Tomer, Lenel Hickson, Jr., and Manal M. Sultan.

ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTIONS 6(c) AND 6(d) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT,
MAKING FINDINGS AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

I.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ) has reason to believe that
from at least March 1, 2013 through November 30, 2014 (the âRelevant Periodâ), Australia and
New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (âANZâ or âRespondentââ) violated Section 4s(f) of the
Commodity Exchange Act (the âActâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6s(f) (2012) and Commission Regulations
(âRegulationsâ) 20.4 and 20.7, 17 C.F.R Â§Â§ 20.4 and 20.7 (2014). Therefore, the Commission
deems it appropriate and in the public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and
hereby are, instituted to determine whether Respondent engaged in the violations set forth herein,
and to determine whether any order should be issued imposing remedial sanctions.

Il.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Respondent has
submitted an Offer of Settlement (âOfferâ), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Without admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, Respondent consents to
the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 6(c) and 6(d) of the
Commodity Exchange Act, Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (âOrderâ) and
acknowledges service of this Order.â

 

1 : : : : . .
Respondent consents to the entry of this Order and to the use of these findings in this proceeding and in any

other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party; provided, however, that
Respondent does not consent to the use of the Offer or the findings or conclusions in this Order consented to in the
Offer, as the sole basis for any other proceeding brought by the Commission, other than a proceeding in bankruptcy
or to enforce the terms of this Order. Nor does Respondent consent to the use of the Offer or this Order, or the
findings or conclusions in this Order consented to in the Offer, by any other party in any other proceeding.
Hil.
The Commission finds the following:
A. SUMMARY

Pursuant to Section 4s(f), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6s(f) and Regulation 20.4 17 C.F.R. Â§ 20.4, Swap
Dealers that meet certain requirements are required to file daily large trader reports for reportable
positions in physical commodity swaps (âLTRsâ), which are populated with specific data as
directed by the Commission. The LTRs must also conform to the form and manner for reporting
and submitting information as set forth in Regulation 20.7, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 20.7.

During the Relevant Period, ANZ filed LTRs which failed to comply with certain
Commission requirements, On Jan. 2, 2014, the Commissionâs Division of Market Oversight
issued a special call notice identifying multiple apparent instances of such noncompliance in
ANZâs LTRs (âSpecial Callâ). After receiving this Special Call, ANZ implemented changes to
its reporting procedures and submitted corrected historical reports.

B. RESPONDENT

Respondent is headquartered in Australia and operates in various locations worldwide.
Primarily in connection with its rates and foreign-exchange businesses, Respondent engages in
swap transactions with U.S.-based entities and has been registered with the Commission as a
Swap Dealer (âSDâ) since January 2013.

C. FACTS

Respondent registered as a Swap Dealer on January 29, 2013. Accordingly, during the
Relevant Period, Respondent was, required to submit LTRs in the form and manner determined
by the Commission.â Respondent submitted LTRs that routinely contained errors. For example,
errors identified in ANZâs LTRs included the following: (1) prior to September 2013, the
Reports did not identify any underlying commodity; (2) throughout the relevant period, the
Reports routinely populated the field for âCommodity Reference Priceâ in a format other than
the one provided by the Commission publication: Large Trader Reporting for Physical
Commodity Swaps: Division of Market Oversight Guidebook for Part 20 Reports (âPart 20
Guidebookâ); (3) in some cases, ANZ reported certain non-zero positions with a value of zero;
(4) throughout the relevant time period, ANZ reported its positions in units of the underlying
commodity rather than in futures contract equivalents; and (5) throughout the relevant time
period, ANZ submitted reports misidentifying counterparty positions as its own positions as the
principal. ANZ also failed to submit reports for certain days in July and September 2013.

 

, The Part 20 rules became effective on September 20, 2011. Following the promulgation of the Part 20
rules, the Commissionâs Division of Market Oversight, through a series of no-action letters, provided temporary
relief from these reporting requirements and certain safe harbor provisions. However, by March 1, 2013, such relief
was no longer available and ANZ was required to be in full compliance with the Part 20 reporting requirements.

 
Due to certain of these errors, ANZ was inaccurately reporting its positions. For
example, in its LTR for August 1, 2013 ANZ reported its positions with respect to CBOT corn in
units of the underlying commodity (i.e., in bushels of corn rather than in the equivalent number
of futures contracts, each of which represents 5,000 bushels of corn) and misidentified
counterparty positions as its own. Consequently, ANZ reported a position more than 5,000 times
its actual size. Accordingly, Respondentâs LTRs did not comply with the requirements
governing Part 20 Reports, which are set forth in Regulations 20.4 and 20.7, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 20.4
and 20.7, in conjunction with further instructions provided in the Part 20 Guidebook.

In accepting Respondentâs Offer, the Commission recognizes Respondentâs cooperation
in this matter. Throughout the Relevant Period, ANZ communicated with DMO regarding issues
with its LTRs. In communications during January 2014, in response to the Special Call,
Respondent represented to DMO that it had analyzed its past reports, and made modifications to
its reporting system as necessary to comply with its LTR reporting requirements. ANZ has self-
reported and corrected additional errors as they were identified, and submitted corrected
historical LTRs.

IV.
LEGAL DISCUSSION

Pursuant to Section 4s(f)(1)(A) of the Act: âEach registered swap dealer and major swap
participant... shall make such reports as are required by the Commission by rule or regulation
regarding the transactions and positions and financial condition of the registered swap dealer or
major swap participant. 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6s(f). Regulation 20.4(c), 17 C.F.R. 20.4(c) (2014) provides
certain enumerated data elements which must be included in a Swap Dealerâs data report. These
data elements include, among others: the commodity underlying the reportable positions, the
commodity reference price, long paired swap positions and short paired swap positions, and an
identifier indicating that a principal or counterparty position is being reported.

Large Trader Reporting for physical commodity swaps is essential to the Commissionâs
ability to conduct effective surveillance of markets in U.S. physical commodity futures and
economically equivalent swaps. Failure to comply with the reporting specifications set forth by
the Commission hinders the Commissionâs ability to efficiently process and effectively utilize
this critical data.

Regulation 20.7, 17 C.F.R. 20.7 (2014) provides, in relevant part: âUnless otherwise
instructed by the Commission, a clearing organization or reporting entity shall submit data
records and any other information required under this part to the Commission ... (a) Using the
format, coding structure, and electronic data transmission procedures approved in writing by the
Commission.â The prescribed manner and form of reporting and submitting swaps data is
provided in the Part 20 Guidebook.â

 

; As provided for in Regulation 20.8, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 20.8 (2014) the Commission delegated certain authority to
the Director of the Division of Market Oversight, or others as the Director may designate from time to time. This
delegated authority includes the authority pursuant to Regulation 20.7 for providing instructions or determining the
format, coding structure, and electronic data transmission procedures for submitting data records and any other
information required under [part 20].â

 
Respondent registered as a Swap Dealer on January 29, 2013 and consequently was
required to submit Part 20 Reports during the Relevant Period. Reports submitted by
Respondent omitted required data elements and reported certain data in a manner that did not
conform to the specifications required by the Commission. Accordingly, Respondentâs reports
did not comply with the requirements, and were in violation of Commission Regulations 20.4
and 20.7.

Therefore, ANZ violated Section 4s(f), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6s(f), and Regulations 20.4 and 20.7,
17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 20.4 and 20.7.

V.
FINDINGS OF VIOLATIONS

Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that Respondent has violated Section 4s(f)
of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6s(f) (2012), and Commission Regulations 20.4 and 20.7, 17 C.F.R.
Â§Â§ 20.4 and 20.7 (2014).

CFTC Orders Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. to Pay a $150,000 Penalty for
Inaccurate Large Trader Reports for Physical Commodity Swap Positions

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today issued an Order filing and
simultaneously settling charges against Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ), an Australia-based
financial services company, for failing to comply with its obligation to submit accurate large trader reports (LTRs) for
physical commodity swap positions, in violation of Section 4s(f) of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC
Regulations 20.4 and 20.7. The CFTC Order requires ANZ to pay a $150,000 civil monetary penalty and to cease and
desist from committing further violations of the CEA and CFTC Regulations, as charged.

This is the CFTCâs first case enforcing the new Dodd-Frank Act large trader reporting requirements for physical
commodity swap positions pursuant to Section 4s(f) of the CEA and Part 20 of the CFTCâs Regulations. According to the
Order, large trader reporting for physical commodity swaps is essential to the CFTCâs ability to conduct effective
surveillance of markets in U.S. physical commodity futures and economically equivalent swaps.

The Order finds that during the period from at least March 1, 2013 through November 30, 2014, ANZ filed LTRs that
routinely contained errors. Specifically, the Order finds that (1) prior to September 2013, the LTRs did not identify any
underlying commodity, (2) the LTRs routinely populated the field for âCommodity Reference Priceâ in a format other than
the one provided by the CFTCâs Guidebook for Part 20 Reports, (3) in some cases, ANZ reported certain non-zero
positions with a value of zero, (4) ANZ reported its positions in units of the underlying commodity rather than in futures
contract equivalents, and (5) ANZ submitted LTRs misidentifying counterparty positions as its own positions as the
principal. Also, the Order finds that ANZ failed to submit reports for certain days in July and September 2013. As noted in
the CFTC Order, ANZ implemented changes to its reporting procedures and submitted corrected historical LTRs.

CFTC Division of Market Oversight staff members responsible for this matter are Matthew Hunter, Kenneth Danger, and
Lynn Riggs. CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this action are Lara Turcik, Patryk J. Chudy,
Lenel Hickson, Jr., and Manal M. Sultan.

COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF AND
PENALTIES UNDER THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT

The United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ or âCFTCââ),

by and through its attorneys, hereby alleges as follows:
I. SUMMARY

1. From July 16, 2011, through the present (the âRelevant Periodâ), Defendant
Mintco LLC (âMintcoâ), by and through its agents, officers, or persons acting within their
employment, agency, or office with Mintco, including its Chief Executive Officer, Stuart Rubin
(âRubinâ) and President, Richard Q. Zimmerman (âZimmermanâ) (collectively, âDefendantsâ),
purported to sell âphysicalâ commodities, including gold, silver, platinum, and palladium, in
storage (âretail commodity transactionsâ), often on a leveraged, margined, or financed basis
(âfinanced transactionsâ), but also on a non-financed or âfully-paidâ basis, to retail customers

who were not eligible contract participants (âECPsâ). In fact, the financed transactions did not
result in actual delivery of metal to customers and Defendants have thus offered to enter into,
accepted orders for, entered into, executed, and confirmed unlawful off-exchange precious
metals transactions and failed to register as a futures commission merchant. In addition,
Defendants have defrauded retail customers by misrepresenting and omitting to disclose material
facts regarding: the past performance of both the financed and fully paid transactions they
marketed; the break-even point for the financed transactions they marketed; and the relationship
between Mintco and retail customers in the financed and fully-paid transactions.

2. Following the enactment of Section 742 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform
and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (âDodd-Frank Actâ or âDodd Frankâ), Public Law 111-
203, 124 Stat. 1376 (2010), effective July 16, 2011, retail commodity transactions must be
executed on a regulated commodities exchange pursuant to Section 4(a) of the Commodity
Exchange Act (âCEAâ or âActâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6(a) (2012).

3. Transactions that result in actual delivery of precious metals to customers within
28 days are excepted from this requirement (the â28-day exceptionâ). To make actual delivery,
the seller in a financed transaction must secure and deliver the contracted amount of physical
metal for each customer within 28 days of its acceptance of the customerâs order. For actual
delivery to result, the customer or the customerâs agent must have possession and control of the
physical metal.

4, The financed transactions Mintco markets to retail customers do not result in
actual delivery. Mintco does not itself acquire, deliver and store any financed metal on behalf of
any of its customers. Instead, it contracts with a third party, Worth Group Inc. (âWorthâ), to
manage its exposure. Worth, in turn, allegedly âdeliversâ the financed precious metal that the

retail customer purchases. Worth maintains a âmasterâ account and customer sub-accounts at
Case :15-cv-61960-BB Bocumenti Entereci on FLSD Docket 09/16/2015 Page 3 of 28

depositories with whom it has contracted to hold metal. Worth is the signatory on both the
master accounts and the sub-accounts, and neither Mintco nor the retail customers have a
contractual relationship with the depositories. For financed transactions, Worth purports to
deliver to retail customers by âallocatingâ metal from the master account to the customer sub-
accounts. These allocations are book entries; there are no physical transfers of metal. Worthâs
depositories maintain possession of the allocated metal, and Worth maintains control of the
metal, so that actual delivery to the retail customers does not occur. Because the financed
transactions do not result in actual delivery, they are illegal, off-exchange transactions.

5. By virtue of this conduct and the conduct further described herein, Defendants
Mintco, Rubin, and Zimmerman have engaged, are engaging, or are about to engage in conduct
in violation of Sections 4(a), 4b(a)(2)(A),(C), 4d, and 6(c)(1) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6(a),
6b(a)(2)(A),(C), 6d, 9(1) (2012), and Regulation 180.1(a), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 180.1(a) (2014).

6. Mintcoâs employees and agents, including Defendants Rubin and Zimmerman,
committed the acts and omissions alleged herein within the course and scope of their
employment, agency or office with Mintco. Therefore, Mintco is liable pursuant to Section
2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(a)(1)(B) (2012), and Commission Regulation 1.2, 17 C.F.R.
Â§ 1.2 (2014), as principal for the violative acts and omissions of Mintcoâs employees and agents,
including Rubin and Zimmerman. Rubin and Zimmerman are also liable for these violations as
controlling persons of Mintco pursuant to Section 13(b), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13(c)(b), because they failed
to act in good faith or knowingly induced the acts constituting Mintcoâs violations.

7. Unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, Defendants are likely to continue

engaging in the acts and practices alleged in this complaint, or in similar acts and practices.

8. The CFTC accordingly brings this action pursuant to Section 6c of the CEA,

7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1, to enjoin Defendantsâ unlawful practices and to compel their compliance with

the CEA and Regulations. In addition, the CFTC seeks restitution, rescission, civil monetary

penalties, and such other equitable relief as this Court may deem appropriate.

II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

9. Section 6c(a) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1(a), authorizes the Commission to seek

III. PARTIES

13. _â_â Plaintiff U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission is an independent

federal regulatory agency that is charged by Congress with the responsibility for administering
Case O15-cv-61960-BB Documenti Entered on FLSD Docket 09/16/2015 Page 5 of 28

and enforcing the provisions of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1 et seg., and the Commission Regulations
(âRegulationsâ) promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§1.1 et seg. (2014).

14. Mintco LLC (âMintcoâ) is a Florida corporation, incorporated on July 14, 2011,
with its principal place of business formerly in Deerfield Beach, Florida and more recently in
Delray Beach, Florida. Mintco is 100% owned by its two principals, Rubin and Zimmerman. In
its solicitation materials, Mintco characterizes itself as âa market maker and dealer in precious
metals.â Mintco, using websites and telemarketers, solicited retail customers to invest in
leveraged, margined, physical, financed or fully paid precious metals transactions. Mintco has
never been registered with the Commission in any capacity.

15. Stuart Rubin resides in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. He is the Chief Executive
Officer, a principal, and 50% owner of Mintco. Rubin was registered as an associated person
with the Commission while employed by various introducing brokers between 1984 and 2006.
He is not currently registered. On April 11, 2003, Rubin was personally sanctioned by the
National Futures Association (âNFAâ) for violation of NFA Rule C.R.2-9, which requires that
â(e]ach member shall diligently supervise its employees and agents in the conduct of their
commodity futures activities for or on behalf of the Member.â At that time, Rubin was fined
$445,000, jointly and severally with the company he operated.

16. Richard Zimmerman resides in Wellington, Florida. He is the President, a
principal, and 50% owner of Mintco. He is currently registered with the Commission as an
associated person of a registered introducing broker. On July 14, 2006, Zimmerman was
sanctioned by the NFA for violation of NFA Rule C.R.2-2(a), which provided that NFA
members shall not â[c]heat, defraud, or deceive, or attempt to cheat, defraud or deceive, any

commodity futures customer,â and BFA Rule 2-29(a)(1), which provided that NFA members
shall not âmake any communication with the public which operates as a fraud or deceit.â At that
time, Zimmerman was fined $5,000, suspended from membership for three months, and required
to tape record all customer calls for six months.

IV. OTHER RELEVANT ENTITIES

17. Worth Group Ine. (âWorthâ) is a Florida corporation formed in June 2002 that
has previously operated under the names of Wilshire Capital Management Corp. and Worth
Bullion Group Inc. Worth describes itself as ââa Florida-based precious metals wholesaler [that]
might also be described as a dealer or broker of precious metals.â Worthâs business office is
located at 3900 Military Trail, Ste. 500, Jupiter, Florida, 33458. Worth has never been registered
with the Commission in any capacity.

18.â Plaintiff CFTC brought an action against Worth in the Southern District of
Florida, CFTC v. Worth Group, Inc., et al., Case No. 13-cv-80796-KLR (S.D. Fla., complaint
filed August 13, 2013), alleging, inter alia, that Worth defrauded retail precious metals customers
and engaged in illegal, off-exchange leveraged commodity transactions with retail customers.

On January 23, 2014, the Court entered a Consent Order of Preliminary Injunction and Other
Ancillary Relief (ECF No. 61) that, among other relief, enjoins Worth from violating certain
provisions of the Act. On April 14, 2014, the Court denied Worthâs motion to dismiss (ECF No.
79), finding that the CFTC had jurisdiction over the alleged transactions and that the complaint,
as filed, stated a claim for fraud. On July 29, 2015, the Court denied the partiesâ cross-motions
for summary judgment (ECF No. 181).

V. STATUTORY BACKGROUND
19. Effective July 16, 2011, the Dodd-Frank Act broadened the scope of the CFTCâs

jurisdiction to include financed commodity transactions with retail customers. The new Section

2(c)(2)(D) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(c)(2)(D), applies, subject to certain exceptions, to âany
Case 0:15-cv-61960-BB DBoourment it Entered on FLSD Docket 09/18/2015 Page 7 of 28

agreement, contract, or transaction in any commodityâ that is entered into with, or offered to, a
person who is not an ECP âon a leveraged or margined basis, or financed by the offeror, the
counterparty, or a person acting in concert with the offeror or counterparty on a similar basis,â
with respect to conduct occurring on or after July 16, 2011.

20. Under Section 2(c)(2)(D)(iii) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(c)(2)(D)(iii), such retail
commodity transactions are subject to Sections 4(a), 4(b), and 4b of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6(a),
6(b), and 6b âas ifâ they are a contract of sale of a commodity for future delivery. As a result,
these transactions must be executed on an exchange and are subject to anti-fraud provisions as
set forth in Sections 4(a) and 4b of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6(a), 6b.

21. The CEA defines an ECP, in relevant part, as an individual who has funds
invested on a discretionary basis, the aggregate of which exceeds $10 million, or $5 million if the
individual enters into the transaction to manage the risk associated with an asset owned or
liability incurred, or reasonably likely to be owned or incurred, by the individual. Section
1a(18)(xi) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1a (18)(xi).

22. Section 4(a) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6(a), in relevant part, makes it unlawful for
any person to offer to enter into, enter into, execute, confirm the execution of, or conduct any
office or business anywhere in the United States for the purpose of soliciting, accepting any
order for, or otherwise dealing in any transaction in, or in connection with, a contract for the
purchase or sale of a commodity for future delivery unless the transaction is conducted on or
subject to the rules of a board of trade that has been designated or registered by the Commission
as a contract market.

23. Section 4b(a)(2) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6(a)(2), in relevant part, makes it

unlawful for any person, in or in connection with any order to make, or the making of, any
Case O15-cv-61960-BB Documenti Entered on FLSD Docket 09/16/2015 Page 8 of 28

contract of sale of any commodity for future delivery that is made, or to be made, for, on behalf
of, or with any other person, other than on or subject to the rules of a designated contract market:
(A) to cheat or defraud or attempt to cheat or defraud the other person; or (C) willfully to deceive
or attempt to deceive the other person by any means whatsoever in regard to any order or
contract or the disposition or execution of any order or contract, or in regard to any act of agency
performed, with respect to any order or contact for, on behalf of, or with the other person.

24. Effective August 15, 2011, Section 753 of the Dodd Frank Act amended Section
6(c) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 9(1), and broadened the CFTCâs anti-fraud jurisdiction as.set out in
Regulation 180.1, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 180.1.

25. Section 6(c)(1) of the CEA, in relevant part, makes it unlawful for any person,
directly or indirectly, to use or employ, or attempt to use or employ, in connection with any
swap, or a contract of sale of any commodity in interstate commerce, or for future delivery on or
subject to the rules of any registered entity, any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance,
in contravention of Regulation 180.1.

26. Effective August 15, 2011, Regulation 180.1, in relevant part, makes it unlawful
for any person, directly or indirectly, in connection with any swap, or contract of sale of any
commodity in interstate commerce, or contract for future delivery on or subject to the rules of
any registered entity, to intentionally or recklessly: (1) use or employ, or attempt to use or
employ, any manipulative device, scheme, or artifice to defraud; (2) make, or attempt to make,
any untrue or misleading statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary
in order to make the statements made not untrue or misleading; or (3) engage, or attempt to
engage, in any act, practice, or course of business, which operates or would operate as a fraud or

deceit upon any person.
Case (15-cyv-61960-BB Documenti fnterecd on FLSO Docket 9/16/2015 Page 9 of 25

VI. DEFENDANTâS UNLAWFUL SCHEME
A. Mintcoâs Business Activities
1. Basic Nature of Mintcoâs Business

27. Mintco holds itself out as a market maker and dealer in precious metals. The
âWelcome to Mintcoâ section of Mintcoâs website, www.mintco.com, states, in relevant part,
â[a]t Mintco we specialize in helping investors diversify a percentage of their portfolio into hard
assets such as gold, silver, and platinum, investment strategies intended to maximize returns
through the outright purchase of or through financed programs.â

28. | Mintco markets stored precious metals to retail customers on both a fully-paid
basis, in which customers pay the full purchase price in return for precious metals, as well as on
a financed basis, in which customers pay a portion of the purchase price and finance the
remainder through Worth.

29. Mintco, by and through its employees and agents, including Defendants Rubin
and Zimmerman, solicited customers through telemarketing and Mintcoâs website, to engage in
leveraged, margined, or financed precious metals transactions as well as fully paid precious
metal transactions.

30. In financed transactions, customers pay a portion of the purchase price of the
metal, which Mintco passes on to Worth, and Worth provides financing directly to the customers
by purportedly loaning them the unpaid portion of the purchase price. The customer is then
charged interest on that loan.

31. None of the precious metals transactions Mintco markets to retail customers are
executed on or subject to the rules of a board of trade or exchange that has been designated or
registered by the Commission as a contract market or derivatives transaction execution facility

for precious metals.
Case O:15-cv-61960-BB Document? Entered on FLSD Docket O9/16/2015 Page 10 of 28

32. Mintco serves as a soliciting firm (âintroducerâ or âretailerââ) that performs sales
functions and introduces customers to Worth. Mintco does not generally buy or sell any
financed or stored metal itself. Instead, it merely accepts customer orders and funds, charges a
commission on the funds, and forwards the orders and funds to Worth or other providers of
metal.

33. The retail customers Mintco deals with consist mostly of individual retail
investors with aggregate discretionary investments of less than $5 million who use their Mintco
accounts for speculative purposes, rather than because they are involved in a line of business
related to precious metals, and are not ECPs.

2. Customer Account Agreement

34. Mintco enters into an account agreement with financed retail customers (âthe
Account Agreementâ) which governs the terms of the relationship and the purchase and sale of
precious metals by retail customers. The Account Agreement provided to customers is
approximately fourteen pages long, printed in ten point font or smaller, and includes in excess of
50 numbered paragraphs. It provides information on the nature of the transactions, the various
fees associated with the transactions, and information on financing.

35. | The customer does not enter into the Account Agreement with Worth â the
ultimate supplier of the metal. Instead, customers enter into the Account Agreement with Mintco
and then Mintco enters into a virtually identical version of the Account Agreement with Worth.

36. As Mintcoâs Chief Executive Officer and President, respectively, and as the two
people primarily responsible for managing Mintco, Rubin and Zimmerman are responsible for
the terms and representations contained in the Account Agreement that Mintco executes with

retail customers.

10
Case :15-cv-61960-8B Document] Entered on FLSD Docket OG/1G/2015 Page Li of 28

3. Order Placement and Transaction Completion

37. Retail customers place orders to buy or sell metals by contacting Mintco. After a
customer communicates an order to Mintco, Mintco contacts Worth to complete the customerâs
transaction. Mintco does so by entering the transaction into Worthâs data system or submitting it
to Worth over the phone or by fax.

38. | The customerâs transaction or contract to buy or purchase metal is complete no
later than the point at which Worth enters the transaction into its data system to finalize it and
issues a confirmation.

4. The Structure of Mintcoâs Financed Transactions

39. In acommon financed transaction, customers leverage their transactions at 2.5 to
1, meaning, for example, that a customer could deposit $10,000 to purchase $25,000 worth of
metal. In an initial customer transaction, the customer submits his deposit, in this example the
$10,000, to Mintco.

40. Between July 2011 and January 2013, upon receipt of customer funds, Mintco
extracted an up-front commission of between zero and fifteen percent of the full value of the
metal purchased for its role in introducing the customer to Worth. Mintcoâs commission was
initially taken (when it was set at between zero and fifteen percent of the full value of the metal
purchased) not as a percentage of a customerâs initial deposit (i.e., $10,000), but instead as a
percentage of the leveraged purchase amount (i.Â¢., $25,000, assuming 2.5 to 1 leverage), also _
known as the âtotal metal valueâ. So, when a customer deposited $10,000 as in the example
above, they were immediately charged an up-front commission by Mintco of $3,750, which
represented 15% of the total metal purchased ($25,000) or 37.5% of their initial deposit

($10,000).

11
ase O:15-cv-61960-BB Documenti Enterecl on FLSD Docket O8/16/2015 Page 12 of 28

41. The remaining funds, in this example, $6,250, would then be submitted to Worth
to purchase the $25,000 of metal for the customerâs account. Crediting these funds against the
purchase amount, the remaining $18,750 is then considered the customerâs âloan balanceâ at
Worth.

42. From January 2013 to November 2014, rather than an up-front commission,
Mintco charged its own premium or âmark upâ of between four and ten percent on the price of
the metal purchased. This percentage was calculated based on the purchase price of the metal,
quoted by Worth, and then added into the ultimate purchase price paid by the customer. The
difference between the customerâs initial down payment and the total value of the metal
purchased was considered the loan balance.

43. | Newcustomers were also generally charged a $200 account opening fee, which
was immediately added to the customerâs loan balance.

44. _ The bulk of Worthâs revenues then come from: (1) charging a spread of 3-5%
above what Worth represented to be the current spot market price of the metal; (2) charging
customers storage fees for the metals in their accounts; and (3) charging customers interest on
their âloan balance.â Worth sets its interest charge at 4.5% above the prime rate, which it has
recently charged at an annual rate of 7.75%. Even though Worth often does not have metal to
sell to customers at the time of their transaction and only secures the metal at some later time,
Worth begins charging customers interest immediately following its acceptance of the customer
transaction.

45. The effect of these interest and storage charges is that the equity (or âmarginâ) in
a customer account â the value of a customerâs metal less their âloan balanceâ at Worth â is

constantly eroded by additions to the customerâs loan balance.

12
Case O:15-cv-61960-BB Document i Entered on FLSD Docket O9/16/2015 Page 13 of 28

46. During the period Mintco was charging its up-front commission of up to 15%,
Worth allowed it to charge and keep an additional spread or mark up of up to 1% of the price of
the metal purchased beyond that already charged by Worth. With respect to financed customers,
Worth also allows Mintco to charge up to an additional 2% interest beyond that charged by
Worth, bringing potential customer interest charges to as much as 9.75%.

47. These various spread and interest charges combine to quickly reduce the equity in
customer accounts, and to place the viability of the customer account at risk. When the equity in
a customer account is reduced to 10% (of the total value of the metal), customers are deemed
subject to an equity call, and must send in additional funds to supplement the equity in the
account. If they are unable to do so, Worth liquidates the customer account at a loss, which is
done by the end of the day on which the account fell below the 10% equity threshold, without the
customerâs permission. With certain very limited exceptions, Worth does not provide retail
customers with any formal notice prior to liquidating their account.

48. The various charges imposed on customer accounts also mean that the price of
precious metals must appreciate tremendously just for the customer to break even on their
investment. The price that precious metals must appreciate to in order to cover costs over a
certain period is termed the âbreak-even point.â For instance, assuming a customer buys
leveraged precious metal at a leverage percentage of 2.5 to 1 and is assessed an up-front Mintco
commission of 15%, total Worth and Mintco interest charges of 9.75%, a total Worth and Mintco
purchase price spread of 4%, and the typically assessed monthly storage fees of $.25 per ounce, a
customer purchasing metals at a market price of $1600 per ounce would break even on their
investment only if the metals reached a market price of $2039.58 by the end of the first year of

the investment, an increase of 23.5%.

13
 

49. Thus, due to the high fees, finance charges and commissions and changes in
metals prices, the retail customers rarely broke even on their investments, let alone earned a
profit, because much of their principal investment was consumed by costs. During the period
following the effective date of Dodd-Frank, over eighty percent of retail customers who
purchased metal in storage through Mintco failed to earn enough on their investments to cover
the costs associated with their purchases and earn a profit.

50. The mechanics of the fully-paid stored transactions Mintco marketed work
similarly to the financed transactions except that customers do not use financing to make the
initial metals purchase and therefore are assessed the commission, account opening fee, and
storage costs but not the same interest costs associated with leveraged purchases.

B. Mintcoâs Failure to Make Actual Delivery to Retail Financed Precious Metal
Customers.

51. | Worth maintained physical metals inventories at two depositories, where it held
its unallocated metals in a master account in Worthâs name. Worth is the signatory on this
account.

52. | When a financed retail customer enters into a transaction to purchase metal
through Mintco, upon notice from Mintco, Worth sends instructions to the depository to
âallocateâ the appropriate type and quantity of metal from Worthâs master account to a âsub-
accountâ in the customerâs name. The allocation is a book entry, where the depository adjusts its
records to reflect a paper change in the quantity of metals in Worthâs master account and the
customer sub-account; the physical metal resides in the same vault as when it was unallocated.
The depository, who is Worthâs agent, maintains possession of the physical metal after the

allocation, not the retail customer.

14
Case O:15-cv-61960-BB Documentid fntered on FLSOD Docket OW16/2015 Page 15 of 28

53. The retail customer receives a piece of paper from Worth with the words,
âCommodity Title Transfer Notice,â on it. However, the rights conveyed by the document are
very limited. The document expressly prohibits the retail customer from granting a security
interest in, or conveying any right with respect to âtheirâ metal to anyone except Worth after
they receive this document.

54. | Worth is also the signatory for the depository agreements related to the customer
sub-accounts. Neither Mintco, nor the retail customer has a contractual relationship with the
depository. In fact, the Sub-Account and Pool Sub-Account Agreements Worth maintained with
at least one depository contain identical language disclaiming any relationship with the retail
customer: â[Worth] acknowledges that [Depository] has no contractual relationship with
[Worthâs] customers and [Worth] is solely responsible for maintaining its customer
relationships.â The significance is twofold: (1) the allocation between the master account and
the customer sub-account is in reality an allocation from one Worth account to another; and
(2) at the sub-account level, the depository remains an agent of Worth, not Mintco or the retail
customer.

55. Worth maintains complete control over the customer sub-account, both before and
after any allocation. Under the agreements with both depositories, only Worth has the ability to
transfer physical metal to and from a customer sub-account. The customer has no control over
any metals in the customer sub-account at the depository.

56. Because the retail customer never has possession and control of the metal in this
process, Mintco has not made actual delivery of precious metals to the retail customers.

57. During the Relevant Period, none of the leveraged, margined, or financed

precious metals transactions entered into with, or offered to, the retail customers by Defendants

15
Case O:15-cv-61960-BB Bocumenti Enterecion FLSD Docket OG/16/2015 Page 16 af 28

were conducted on or subject to the rules of any board of trade, exchange, contract market, or
derivatives transaction execution facility.

58. During the Relevant Period, Defendants Rubin and Zimmerman either personally
solicited customers for Mintco, offered or accepted Mintco customer orders in connection with
leveraged, margined, or financed precious metals transactions, or committed the acts described
herein within the course and scope of their employment at, or agency with Mintco.

59. During the Relevant Period, Defendants Rubin and Zimmerman were the
principals of Mintco and the signatories on Mintco bank accounts. Rubin and Zimmerman each
had authority to hire and fire Mintco employees and sign contracts on behalf of Mintco. They
participated in creating Mintcoâs marketing strategy, and placed and confirmed customer orders
for precious metals.

C. Mintcoâs Fraudulent or Deceptive Misrepresentations and Omissions to Customers

60. During the Relevant Period, Defendants fraudulently and deceptively
misrepresented or omitted to disclose material facts to potential and existing retail customers
which included: misrepresenting the nature of the relationship between Mintco and retail
customers in financed and fully-paid stored metal transactions, misrepresenting the break-even
price of investments in precious metal to customers in financed transactions, and omitting to
inform customers in financed and fully-paid stored precious metal transactions that in excess of
80% of the retail customers who purchased metal in storage, failed to cover their costs and earn a
profit on their investments.

1. Misrepresentation of Relationship Between Mintco and the Retail Customers
in Financed and Fully-Paid Transactions for Stored Precious Metal

61. | Defendants made material oral and written fraudulent or deceptive

misrepresentations to potential and existing customers that Mintco would act in their best interest

16
Case (15-cv-61960-BB Document i Entered on FLSD Docket OO/T8/2018 Page 17 af 38

and as customersâ agent or representative. The standard solicitation materials Mintco sent to
customers included an introductory letter from a Mintco Account Executive which prominently
featured the statement, âMintco, LLC is an independent Introducing Precious Metals Broker that
will act as your representative in the area of purchasing those metals.â (emphasis added) This
statement was also part of Mintco telephone scripts distributed to Mintco brokers, intended to be
communicated verbally to potential customers during solicitation calls.

62. | Mintcoâs September 2011 solicitation scripts include the fraudulent statement
âYour Account Executive will work diligently with you to establish the most beneficial Precious
Metals portfolio for your account.â

63. During the Summer of 2012, Mintco mailed a document to customers titled
âMintco Palladium Report Summer of 2012,â in which Mintco made the following fraudulent
and deceptive misrepresentation regarding the formation of an agency relationship with its
customers, stating:

Your down payment is approximately 27% of the total metal value and Mintco

LLC will act on your behalf as your agent and arrange for financing and storage

of your metal through our counterparty. (Emphasis added)

64. In 2013, Mintco mailed a second document to customers titled âMintco Palladium
Report 2013,â in which Mintco again made a similarly fraudulent and deceptive
misrepresentation regarding the formation of an agency relationship with its customers, stating:

Your down payment is approximately 25% of the total metal value and Mintco,

LLC will act on your behalf as your agent and arrange for financing and storage

of your metal through our counterparty. (emphasis added)

65. | _Mintcoâs website, on an introductory page titled ââWelcome to Mintcoâ, further

stated, â[w]e always place the best interests of our clients above our own personal and business

interests.â

17
Case :15-cv-61960-8B Document] Entered on FLSD Docket 09/16/2015 Page 18 of 28

66. These misrepresentations by Mintco, intended to create the impression that
Mintco would be acting in customersâ best interest or as their agent, were false and deceptive,
and Defendants knew that these representations were false as they directly conflicted with the
description of the customer relationship as disclosed in small print in Mintcoâs account
agreement. Paragraph 4.2 of the Account Agreement, titled Role of Mintco, states that â[nJeither
Mintco nor any of its employees acts as an agent or fiduciary for any of retail customers.â
Paragraph 11 of the Account Agreement, titled Customer Acknowledgement of Risks, further
provides, inter alia, that:

Mintco and its employees and suppliers are not agents for Customer and owe no fiduciary

duty to Customer.
he

Mintco and its representatives earn income based upon the volume and type of

transactions with customers. In the process of selling precious metals to, and buying

precious metals from, you, you should assume that the interests of Mintco and its

representatives conflict with your interests.

67. | These misrepresentations were material since a reasonable customer would want
to know whether Mintco was acting in customersâ interest when Mintco was making investment

recommendations.

2. Misrepresentation of Break-Even Point on Investments in Financed
Transactions for Stored Metal

68. Beginning in October 2013, Defendants also made material fraudulent and
deceptive oral misrepresentations to customers at the time financed metals were purchased
regarding the break-even point â i.e., how much the investment in precious metal would have to
appreciate to cover costs and earn a profit â by informing customers during tape-recorded
telephone conversations that the break-even price was âapproximately the same as the purchase

price.â

18
Case O:15-cv-61960-BB Document i Entered on FLSD Docket O9/16/2015 Page 19 of 28

69. These statements were false, and Mintco sales representatives knew them to be
false or acted in reckless disregard of the truth because, in reality, the customersâ break-even
prices were materially higher than the purchase prices in financed transactions because of the
significant costs and fees associated with the transactions. In fact, few if any customersâ
investments were able to cover their costs and earn a profit.

70. This misrepresentation was clearly material in that a reasonable customer would
certainly want to know that the break-even price on his or her investment was materially
different from and significantly higher than the purchase price.

3. Failure to Disclose that Over Eighty Percent of Retail Customers Who

Purchased Financed and Fully Paid Precious Metal in Storage Failed to
Cover the Costs of their Investment and Lost Money

71. Defendants also recklessly omitted to disclose to potential customers that over
80% of the retail customersâ investments in financed and fully paid stored precious metal failed
to appreciate enough during the relevant period to cover the costs associated with the investment
and earn a profit.

72. This failure to disclose prior customersâ losses constituted a fraudulent omission
in light of other statements made by Mintco regarding the financial benefits of investing in
precious metal through Mintco.

73. For instance, Mintcoâs website, on an introductory page titled âWelcome to
Mintcoâ, stated,â[w]e work hard to source and serve as many people as we can and put them on
the road to prosperity.â It also stated, â[a]t Mintco, we specialize in helping investors diversify a
percentage of their portfolio into hard assets such as gold, silver, and platinum, investment
strategies intended to maximize returns through the outright purchase of or through financed

programs.â (Emphasis added).

19

74. Furthermore, Mintcoâs September 2011 solicitation scripts used during customer
calls informed customers, â[y]our Account Executive will work diligently with you to establish
the most beneficial Precious Metals portfolio for your account.â (Emphasis added).

75. Additionally, Mintco stated in its introductory letter to customers that, â[b]ased on
your investment objectives and sophistication, your Mintco Account Executive will assist you in
determining the best way to handle your precious metals investment needs.â

76. Past performance of an investment program is material to a customerâs decision to
invest. A reasonable investor would want to know that over 80% of the retail customersâ
investments in stored precious metal failed to appreciate enough during the relevant period to
cover the costs associated with the investment and earn a profit.

Vii. VIOLATIONS OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT AND REGULATIONS

COUNT I - Violation of Section 4(a) of the Act: Unlawful Off-Exchange Transactions
with Respect to Financed Transactions

77. Paragraphs 1 through 77 are realleged and incorporated herein by reference.

78. Between July 16, 2011, and the present, Mintco, Rubin, and Zimmerman have
offered to enter into, entered into, executed, confirmed, or conducted an office or business in the
United States for the purpose of soliciting, accepting any order for, or otherwise dealing in
agreements, contracts, or transactions in commodities (the âretail commodity transactionsâ) on a
leveraged or margined basis, or financed by the offeror, the counterparty, or a person acting in
concert with the offeror or counterparty on a similar basis, with persons who are not eligible
contract participants or eligible commercial entities as defined by the CEA, and who are not

engaged in a line of business related to precious metals.

20
Case O:15-cv-61950-BB Documenti Entered on PLSD Docket OO/16/2015 Page ai of 28

79. Pursuant to Section 2(c)(2)(D)(iii) of the CEA, 7US.C. Â§ 2(c)(2)(D) (iii), the
retail commodity transactions are subject to Section 4(a) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6(a), as if they
are contracts of sale of a commodity for future delivery.

80. âThe retail commodity transactions have not been made or conducted on, or
subject to, the rules of any board of trade, exchange, or contract market, were not conducted with
non-ECPs, and were not delivered within 28 days.

81. Mintco has therefore violated Section 4(a) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6(a), by
offering to enter into, entering into, executing, confirming the execution of, or conducting any
office or business anywhere in the United States for the purpose of soliciting, accepting any
order, or otherwise dealing in any transaction in, or in connection with retail commodity
transactions, other than on or subject to the rules of a board of trade that has been designated or
registered by the Commission as a contract market.

82. The acts, omissions, and failures of Rubin, Zimmerman, and other officials,
agents, or persons acting for Mintco described in this Complaint have occurred within the scope
of their employment, agency, or office with Mintco, and are deemed to be the acts, omissions,
and failures of Mintco by operation of Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(a)(1)(B) and
Regulation 1.2, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.2.

83. Rubin and Zimmerman have controlled Mintco and have not acted in good faith
or have knowingly induced, directly or indirectly, the acts constituting Mintcoâs violations
alleged in this count. As a result, pursuant to Section 13(b) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13c(b),
Rubin and Zimmerman are, in addition to their direct liability, also liable for Mintcoâs violations

of Section 4(a) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. Â§6(a), as controlling persons.

21
Case O:15-cv-61960-BB Document? Entered on FLSD Docket O9/16/2015 Page 22 of 28

84. _ Each act of offering to enter into, entering into, executing, confirming the
execution of, or conducting any office or business anywhere in the United States for the purpose
of soliciting, accepting any order for, or otherwise dealing in any transaction in, or in connection
with, retail commodity transactions, other than on or subject to the rules of a board of trade that
has been designated or registered by the Commission as a contract market, is alleged as a
separate and distinct violation of Section 4(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6(a).

COUNT II â Violation of Section 4d of the Act:
Failure to Register with Respect to Financed Transactions

85. Paragraphs 1 through 77 are realleged and incorporated herein by reference.

86. | The Dodd-Frank Act amended the definition of âfutures commission merchantâ in
the CEA to include any individual, association, partnership, corporation, or trust that, among
other things, is engaged in accepting orders for any agreement, contract, or transaction described
in Section 2(c)(2)(D)(i) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(c)(2)(D)Q).

87. Between July 16, 2011 and the present, Mintco, through its agents and employees,
accepted orders for agreements, contracts, or transactions described in Section 2(c)(2)(D)(i) of
the CEA, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(c)(2)(D)(i).

88. Section 4d of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6d, provides that it shall be unlawful for any
person to be a futures commission merchant unless such person shall have registered with the
Commission as a futures commission merchant.

89. _ During the relevant period, Mintco has failed to register with the Commission as a
futures commission merchant and has therefore violated Section 4d of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6d.

90. | Rubin and Zimmerman have controlled Mintco and have not acted in good faith
or have knowingly induced the acts constituting the violations of Mintco described in this Count.

Pursuant to Section 13(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13(b), Rubin and Zimmerman are therefore

22
Case O:15-cv-61950-BB Documenti Entered on PLSD Docket OO/16/2015 Page 23 of 28

liable as controlling persons for Mintcoâs violations of Section 4d(a)(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.

Â§ 6d.

COUNT Ill - Violations of Sections 4b(a)(2)(A), (C) of the Act:

Fraud by Material Misrepresentations and Omissions with Respect to Financed
Transactions

91. Paragraphs | through 77 are realleged and incorporated herein by reference.

92. Sections 4b(a)(2)(A),(C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6b(a)(2)(A),(C) (2012), makes it
unlawful for any person, in or in connection with any order to make, or the making of, any contract of
sale of any commodity in interstate commerce or for future delivery that is made, or to be made, on or
subject to the rules of a designated contract market, for or on behalf of any other person: (A) to cheat
or defraud or attempt to cheat or defraud such other person; or (C) willfully to deceive or attempt to
deceive such other person by any means whatsoever in regard to any order or contract or the
disposition or execution of any order or contract, or in regard to any act of agency performed, with
respect to any order or contract for such other person.

93. | By making material misrepresentations and omissions to customers in connection with
the purchase or sale of financed transactions in precious metal, Defendants defrauded, and deceived
them in violation of Section 4b(a)(2)(A),(C).

94. Each fraudulent or deceptive misrepresentation or omission made by Defendants
constitutes a separate and distinct violation of Section 4b(a)(2)(A),(C) of the Act.

95. Rubin and Zimmerman have controlled Mintco and have not acted in good faith or
have knowingly induced the acts constituting the violations of Mintco described in this Count.
Pursuant to Section 13(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13(b), Rubin and Zimmerman are therefore liable as
controlling persons for Mintcoâs violations of Sections 4b(a)(2)(A), (C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§

6b(a)(2)(A), (C).

98. Section 6(c)(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 9(1) (2012) provides, in relevant part, that â[i]t
shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, to use or employ or attempt to use or employ,

future delivery on or subject to the rules of any registered entity, any manipulative or deceptive device
or contrivance, in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Commission shall promulgate.â

99. __ Regulation 180.1(a), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 180.1(a) (2014) provides in relevant part, that âi]t
shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, in connection with any swap, or contract of

105. Rubin and Zimmerman have controlled Mintco and have not acted in good faith or
have knowingly induced the acts constituting the violations of Mintco described in this Count.

CFTC Charges Florida Company Mintco LLC and Florida Residents Stuart Rubin and
Richard Q. Zimmerman with Engaging in Illegal, Off-Exchange Precious Metals
Transactions and Defrauding Customers

Washington, DC â The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced the filing of a civil
enforcement Complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida against Mintco LLC of Delray Beach,
Florida, and its principals Stuart Rubin of Fort Lauderdale and Richard Q. Zimmerman of Wellington, Florida. The
CFTC Complaint charges the Defendants with engaging in illegal and fraudulent off-exchange transactions in precious
metals with retail customers. The Complaint further alleges that Rubin and Zimmerman controlled Mintco and are liable
as controlling persons for Mintcoâs violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA).

According to the Complaint, from July 16, 2011 to the present, Mintco, by and through its employees, agents, or officers,
including Rubin and Zimmerman, unlawfully solicited low net worth retail customers through telemarketing and Mintcoâs
website to buy or sell stored precious metals such as gold, silver, platinum, and palladium on a fully paid or leveraged,
margined, or financed basis.

Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act), transactions of this
nature are unlawful unless they result in actual delivery of metals within 28 days of the purchase or sale, and unless the
retail customers have sufficient net worth to be considered eligible contract participants (ECPs). According to the
Complaint, Mintcoâs customers did not qualify as ECPs; Mintco did not itself acquire, deliver, and store any financed metal
on behalf of its customers; and the transactions did not result in actual delivery of metal to Mintco customers within the
28-day time-frame required by the Dodd-Frank Act. As a result, the Complaint alleges that the Defendantsâ precious
metals transactions constituted unlawful off-exchange retail commodity transactions. The Complaint also alleges that
Mintco was not registered as a Futures Commission Merchant, as required under the CEA to offer those transactions.

The Complaint further alleges that Mintco defrauded retail customers by misrepresenting and omitting to disclose
material facts regarding 1) the past performance of the precious metals it marketed, 2) the price that the metals would
need to reach for the customers to break even on their purchases, and 3) the nature of the relationship between Mintco
and retail customers. According to the Complaint, Mintco charged customers commissions and fees that totaled as much
as 37.5 percent of the customerâs investment and failed to inform customers that in excess of 80 percent of customers
who purchased stored precious metal from it failed to cover their storage costs, interest charges, and other fees and earn
a profit on their investments.

Finally, the Complaint alleges that Mintco contracted with a third party, Worth Group Inc. (Worth), to manage its
obligations. However, according to the Complaint, those financed precious metals transactions marketed by Mintco did
not result in actual delivery within the prescribed 28-day window. The CFTC sued Worth in the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of Florida in August 2013 (see CFTC Press Release 6666-13), charging Worth with engaging in illegal,
off-exchange precious metals transactions and other violations. On January 23, 2014, the District Court entered a
Consent Order of Preliminary Injunction enjoining Worth from violating anti-fraud provisions of the CEA.

In its continuing litigation against Mintco, Rubin, and Zimmerman, the CFTC seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains,
restitution for the benefit of customers, civil monetary penalties, permanent registration and trading bans, and a
permanent injunction from future violations of the CEA, as charged.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Jon J. Kramer, Susan B. Padove, Joy H.
McCormack, Jeffrey Gomberg, Elizabeth M. Streit, David A. Terrell, Scott R. Williamson, and Rosemary Hollinger.

ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTIONS 6(c) AND 6(d) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT
MAKING FINDINGS AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

I.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ) has reason to believe that
in or about July 2010 (the âRelevant Periodâ), Robert M. McMahon (âMcMahonâ or
Respondentâ) violated Sections 4b(a)(1)(A) and (C) of the Commodity Exchange Act (âCEAâ
or âActâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6b(a)(1)(A) and (C). Therefore, the Commission deems it appropriate and
in the public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted to
determine whether Respondent engaged in the violations set forth herein and to determine
whether any order should be issued imposing remedial sanctions.

Il.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Respondent has
submitted an Offer of Settlement (âOfferâ), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Without admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, Respondent consents to
the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 6(c) and 6(d) of the
Commodity Exchange Act Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (âOrderâ) and
acknowledges service of this Order.â

 

' Respondent consents to the entry of this Order and to the use of these findings in this
proceeding and in any other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission
is a party; provided, however, that Respondent does not consent to the use of the Offer, or the
findings or conclusions in this Order consented to in the Offer, as the sole basis for any other
proceeding brought by the Commission, other than in a proceeding in bankruptcy or to enforce
the terms of this Order. Nor does Respondent consent to the use of the Offer or this Order, or the

1
The Commission finds the following:
A.

During the Relevant Period, McMahon engaged in a deceptive scheme to allocate to
himself futures contracts priced better than market prices, and to allocate to a customer futures
contracts priced worse than market prices. To perpetuate the scheme, the customerâs natural gas
futures orders would be filled with noncompetitively-executed block trades with McMahon
taking the other side of the customerâs block trades. The block trades were executed at prices
unfavorable to the customer but favorable to McMahon. At roughly the same time as the block
trades were executed, McMahon had executed for himself futures contracts on NYMEX at
market prices that entirely offset his noncompetitively-executed block trades with their better-
than-market prices. With this structureâmatching McMahonâs noncompetitively priced block
trades almost immediately with offsetting, competitively priced market tradesâthe scheme
virtually guaranteed that McMahon profited, at the customerâs expense, on each block trade. On
July 28, 2010, McMahon improperly profited $171,800 from two such transactions.

B. RESPONDENT

Robert M. McMahon is a resident of Mt. Pocono, Pennsylvania. Before and after the
Relevant Period, McMahon was registered with the Commission as an associated person,
During the Relevant Period, McMahon was not registered with the Commission in any capacity,
and McMahonâs application for registration as an associated person was pending.

C, FACTS

Before the Relevant Period, McMahon worked at various entities for several years
trading commodities and commodity futures contracts and was registered with the Commission
as an associated person. In July 2010, he was no longer registered or employed by a registrant.

During the Relevant Period, McMahon and a floor trading clerk engaged in a scheme that
worked as follows. First, the clerk placed with a floor broker an order for NYMEX Henry Hub
Natural Gas Futures Contracts in an amount desired by a customer. At roughly the same time
that order was executed, the clerk reported a noncompetitive block trade between McMahon and
the customer, buying and selling the same amount of natural gas futures contracts as in the order
placed with the floor broker, but at a worse price for the customer than the market prices.

Pursuant to McMahonâs scheme, the clerk then allocated the market trades and the
offsetting side of the block trade to McMahonâs account, thus liquidating McMahonâs market
trades and block trades at a profit. The clerk also allocated the opposite side of the block trade to
the customerâs account, thus filling the customerâs order at a worse price for the customer than
the market prices. In this way, without disclosing the allocation scheme to the customer,
McMahon received the better than market prices for himself while worse than market prices
were received by the customer.

 

findings or conclusions in this Order consented to in the Offer, by any other party in any other
proceeding.

 
In particular, McMahon engaged in two such allocations on July 28, 2010. One
transaction involved a block trade between McMahon and the customer for 124 August 2010
futures contracts at better than market prices for McMahon and worse than market prices for the
customer. The other involved a block trade between McMahon and the customer for 196
September 2010 futures contracts at better than market prices for McMahon and worse than
market prices for the customer. At roughly the same time that each block trade was executed,
McMahon exactly offset his better than market-priced block trades against his market-priced
trades, thereby accruing $171,800 in profits with virtually no risk.

Ii.
LEGAL DISCUSSION
McMahon Engaged in Trade-Practices Fraud

Section 4b(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6b(a), applies to the futures contracts transactions
conducted by Respondent in this matter because they were in or in connection with the making
of contracts of sale of a commodity for future delivery made on or subject to the rules of a
designated contract market, namely NYMEX.

In particular, Sections 4b(a)(1)(A) and (C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6b(a)(1)(A) and (C),
make it unlawful

for any person, in or in connection with any order to make, or the making of, any contract
of sale of any commodity in interstate commerce or for future delivery that is made, or to
be made, on or subject to the rules of a designated contract market, for or on behalf of

Causing deceptive allocation of favorable futures order fills to an account from which
one benefits violates Sections 4b(a)(1)(A) and (C). See, e.g., In re Thomas Carroll and R. Scott

CFTC Orders Pennsylvania Resident Robert M. McMahon to Pay $171,800 Civil Monetary
Penalty and Imposes Permanent Trading and Registration Bans for Engaging in Deceptive
Trade Allocation Scheme

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today issued an Order filing and
simultaneously settling charges against Robert M. McMahon of Mt. Pocono, Pennsylvania, for engaging in a deceptive
trading scheme involving Henry Hub Natural Gas Futures (NG) contracts, traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange
(NYMEX). The CFTC Order requires McMahon to pay a $171,800 civil monetary penalty and imposes permanent trading
and registration bans on him. The Order also requires McMahon to cease and desist from further violations of the
Commodity Exchange Act, as charged.

The Order finds that, in or about July 2010, McMahon engaged in a deceptive trading scheme that allocated to himself
futures contracts priced at better than market prices, while allocating to a customer futures contracts priced at worse
than market prices. To perpetuate the scheme, the customerâs NG orders were filled with noncompetitively executed
block trades, with McMahon taking the other side of the customerâs block trades. The Order further finds that these block
trades were executed at prices unfavorable to the customer but favorable to McMahon. Almost simultaneously, McMahon
executed for himself futures contracts on NYMEX at market prices that entirely offset his noncompetitively executed
block trades for a large profit. Further, according to the Order, with this structure â matching McMahon's
noncompetitively priced block trades almost immediately with offsetting, competitively priced market trades â the
scheme virtually guaranteed that McMahon profited, at the customerâs expense, on each block trade. On July 28, 2010,
McMahon improperly profited $171,800 from two such transactions, the Order finds.

The CFTC appreciates the assistance of the CME Group.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Gates S. Hurand, K. Brent Tomer, Lenel Hickson
Jr., and Manal M. Sultan.

CFTC Docket No. 15-33
In the Matter of:
ORDER INSTITUTING
PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTIONS 6(c) AND 6(d) OF THE
COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT
MAKING FINDINGS AND
IMPOSING REMEDIAL
SANCTIONS

TeraExchange LLC,

Respondent.

Nene Newnes âee eeâ

 

I.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionââ) has reason to believe that
TeraExchange, LLC (âTeraâ), a provisionally registered swap execution facility (âSEFâ), has
violated Section 5h(f)(2) of the Commodity Exchange Act (âActâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 7b-3(1)(2) (2012),
and Commission Regulation (âRegulationââ) 37.203, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 37.203 (2014). The
Commission, therefore, deems it appropriate and in the public interest that a public
administrative proceeding be, and hereby is, instituted to determine whether Tera engaged in the
violations set forth herein and to determine whether any order should be issued imposing
remedial sanctions.

Il.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Tera has submitted an
Offer of Settlement (âOfferââ), which the Commission has determined to accept. Tera
acknowledges service of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 6(c) and 6(d) of
the Commodity Exchange Act, Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (âOrderâ). '

 

' Tera consents to the entry of this Order, the use of these findings in this proceeding and

in any other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party;
provided, however, that Tera does not consent to the use of the Offer, or the findings in this
Order consented to in the Offer, as the sole basis for any other proceeding brought by the
Commission, other than a proceeding in bankruptcy or to enforce the terms of this Order. Nor
does Tera consent to the use of the Offer or this Order, or the findings consented to in the Offer
or this Order, by any other party in any other proceeding.
III.

The Commission finds the following:

A. Summary

On October 8, 2014, two traders executed a transaction in a non-deliverable forward
contract based on the relative value of the U.S. Dollar and Bitcoin, a virtual currency (the
âBitcoin swapâ). Six minutes later, the two traders executed a fully offsetting transaction in the
Bitcoin swap for the same price and notional amount. As a result, the two transactions (the
âOctober 8 transactionsâ) constitute both wash trading and prearranged trading in violation of
Section 4c(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6c(a) (2012).

Tera arranged the two transactions with the understanding that the parties, who did not
know of each otherâs identities, would execute âa round-trip trade with the same price in, same
price out (i.e. no P/L [profit/loss] consequences)[.]â Tera employees were on Skype calls with
the two traders as they executed the transactions. The two traders involved were the only market
participants on Teraâs SEF who had completed the membership process and had received trading
privileges on the SEF.

On October 9, 2014, Tera issued a press release, stating that ââTeraExchange announced
today the first bitcoin derivative transaction to be executed on a regulated exchange.â Tera
intended for its press release and a related statement by its then-president to create the
impression of actual trading interest in the Bitcoin swap.

Section 5h(f)(2)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 7b-3(f)(1) (2012) and Regulation 37.203(a), 17
C.F.R. Â§ 37.203(a) (2014), obligate Tera to establish and enforce rules prohibiting wash trading
and prearranged trading on the SEF. Instead, Tera actively arranged for the two traders to enter
into prearranged wash trades.

B. Respondent

TeraExchange, LLC is a Delaware limited liability company, with its principal place of
business in Summit, New Jersey. Tera has been registered provisionally with the Commission as
a SEF since September 19, 2013, with its application for permanent SEF registration pending.

C, Facts

Tera is operating a SEF pursuant to a grant of temporary registration by the
Commissionâs Division of Market Oversight (âDMOâ) effective September 19, 2013.

Tera compiled a rulebook governing the operation of the SEF and trading on the SEF by
market participants. Tera requires all participants on its SEF to comply with the SEFâs rulebook.
Teraâs rulebook states, in relevant part, that

â(njo Participant shall create fictitious transactions or wash transactions or
execute any such Order with knowledge of its nature. No Participant shall place
or accept Orders in the same Instrument where the Participant knows or

2
reasonably should know that the purpose of the Orders is to avoid taking a bona
fide market position exposed to market risk (transactions commonly known or
referred to as wash sales).â

On September 11, 2014, Tera filed with DMO a submission self-certifying the Bitcoin
swap for trading on its SEF. Tera began offering the Bitcoin swap for trading on September 12,
2014. Valuations of the Bitcoin swap are determined by reference to an index of bids, offers,
and executed transactions on a number of Bitcoin exchanges (the âTera Bitcoin indexâ).

Teraâs rulebook requires a market participant to complete an onboarding process,
including the completion of an exchange user license agreement (âEULAâ), before being granted
membership and being allowed to trade any product on the Tera SEF. As of October 8, 2014,
only two market participants (âFirm Aâ and âFirm Bâ) had completed the onboarding processes
to trade on the Tera SEF.

On October 7, 2014, an employee of Tera sent an email to an authorized trader for Firm
B (âTrader Bââ), which had recently completed the onboarding process. The Tera employee
stated that Tera had âta counterparty [Firm A] who would like to do a trade.â The Tera employee
said âwe would like to test the pipes by doing a round-trip trade with the same price in, same
price out, (i.e. no P/L [profit/loss] consequences) no custodian required.â On a call that
afternoon with the Tera employee, Trader B agreed to the trade, scheduled for the following day.

On the morning of October 8, 2014, Tera employees initiated Skype calls with both
Trader A and Trader B to walk them through the trade. At 9:22 a.m., Trader A initiated a
transaction to buy a Bitcoin swap with a notional amount of $500,000 at a defined price, which
Trader B accepted. Six minutes later, Trader A initiated a transaction to sell a Bitcoin swap with
a notional amount of $500,000 and at the same defined price, which Trader B also accepted.

The two transactions on October 8 canceled each other out. The transactions were
offsetting, were intended to negate, and did negate, any market risk and achieved a âwashâ
result. The transactions did not create any bona fide position in the Bitcoin swap. Further, Tera
did not charge a transaction fee or commission to either party, meaning that there were no
transaction costs associated with the two transactions,

On October 8, 2014, the National Futures Association (âNFAâ) (which provides
regulatory services for Tera) and the CFTCâs Division of Market Oversight (âDMOââ) separately
contacted Tera regarding the two offsetting transactions. Tera told DMO and the NFA that the
purpose of the transactions was to âtest the pipes.â

Nevertheless, on October 9, 2014, Tera issued a press release, stating that ââTeraExchange
announced today the first bitcoin derivative transaction to be executed on a regulated exchange.â
Tera employees forwarded drafts of the press release to Trader A and made some edits at his
request.â Also on October 9, 2014, Teraâs then-president appeared at a meeting of the
Commissionâs Global Markets Advisory Committee (ââGMACâ), where he stated that trades had
occurred in the Bitcoin swap the day before.

The October 8 transactions were the only transactions in the Bitcoin swap executed on
the Tera SEF as of the date of this Order and provided an opportunity for Tera to state publicly
that trading in the Bitcoin swap had occurred. Tera intended for its press release and statements
at the GMAC to create the impression of actual trading interest in the Bitcoin swap. As a result,
neither Teraâs press release nor the statements at the GMAC indicated that the October 8
transactions were pre-arranged wash sales executed solely for the purpose of testing Teraâs
systems.

These facts should be distinguished from a situation where a SEF or other designated
contract market runs pre-operational test trades to confirm that its systems are technically
capable of executing transactions and, to the extent that these simulated transactions become
publicly known, makes it clear to the public that the trades do not represent actual liquidity in the
subject market.

D. Legal Discussion

1. Compliance with SEF Core Principles

As a condition of registration, SEFs are obligated to comply with the SEF Core Principles
under the Act. Section 5h(f)(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 7b-3(f)(1) (2012). SEF Core Principle 2
requires that a SEF shall âestablish and enforce trading, trade processing, and participation rules
that will deter abuses and have the capacity to detect, investigate, and enforce those rules[.]â
Section 5h(f)(2)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 7b-3(f)(2)(B) (2012).

A Commission regulation providing additional guidance on compliance with SEF Core
Principle 2 requires SEFs to âprohibit abusive trading practices on its markets... Specific trading
practices that shall be prohibited include...wash trading [and] pre-arranged trading[.]â
Regulation 37.203(a), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 37.203(a) (2014).

De Prohibition on Wash Trading and Prearranged Trading

Market participants are prohibited from engaging in âwash tradingâ and âprearranged
tradingâ in swaps under Section 4c(a) of the Act, which makes it unlawful to enter a transaction
that âis, is of the character of, or is commonly known to the trade as, a âwash saleâ or
âaccommodation tradeâ...or is a fictitious sale or is used to cause any price to be reported,
registered, or recorded that is not a true and bona fide price.â 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6c(a)(2).Â° Congress

 

; Following conversations with counsel for the Commission, Tera voluntarily removed the
October 9 press release from its website.

: As relevant here, pursuant to Section 2(a)(1)(A) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(a)(1)(A) (2012)
the Commission has exclusive jurisdiction over âtransactions involving swaps...traded or
executed on a... swap execution facility pursuant to section 5hâ. In addition, the swap offered by
Tera is not subject to any exceptions to the CFTCâs jurisdiction. Regardless, Teraâs submission

4
enacted Section 4c(a) of the Act to prevent collusive trades conducted away from the market.
See, generally, Merrill Lynch Futures, Inc. v. Kelly, 585 F.Supp. 1245, 1251 n.3 (S.D.N.Y.
1984). As a result of wash trading and fictitious sales, âperceived market volume [is] distorted,
and the marketâs price discovery function hindered.â Jn the Matter of Thomas Collins, [1996-
1998 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) 9 27,194 at 45,743 (CFTC December 10,
1997) (citing In the Matter of Citadel Trading Co. of Chicago, Ltd., [1986-1987 Transfer Binder]
Comm. Fut. L. rep. (CCH) Â§ 24,085 at 32,191 (CFTC May 12, 1986).

A wash trade âis a transaction made without an intent to take a genuine, bona fide
position in the market, such as a simultaneous purchase and sale designed to negate each other so
that there is no change in financial position.â Reddy v. CFTC, 191 F.3d 109, 115 (2d Cir. 1999),
âIn order to establish that a wash sale has occurred, the [Commission] must initially demonstrate
that the transaction at issue achieved a wash result. The factors that show a wash result are (1)
the purchase and sale (2) of the same delivery month of the same futures contract (3) at the same
(or a similar) price.â Jn re Piasio, [1999-2000 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) 4
28,276 at 50,685 (CFTC Sept. 29, 2000) (citing In re Gilchrist, [1990-1992 Transfer Binder]
Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) 4 24,993 at 37,653 (CFTC Jan. 25, 1991)), aff'd, Piasio v. CFTC, 54
F. Appâx 702 (2d Cir. 2002); see also Wilson v. CFTC, 322 F.3d 555, 559 (8th Cir. 2003) (same).

In addition, the Commission âmust demonstrate that the [defendant] intended to negate
risk or price competition,â and âthat at the time [the defendant] chose to participate in the
transaction he knew that the transaction was designed to achieve a wash result in a manner that
negated risk.â Jn re Piasio, Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) 4 28,276 at 50,685 (citing In re Gimbel,
[1987-1990 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) Â§ 24,213 at 35,003 (CFTC Apr. 14,
1988), aff'd as to liability, Gimbel vy. CFTC, 872 F.2d 196 (7th Cir. 1989), and In re Bear Stearns
& Co., [1990-1992 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) Â¥ 24,994 at 37,665 (CFTC Jan.
25, 1991)); see also Reddy, 191 F.3d at 119 (â[T]he [Commission] must prove intent to establish
a violation of... Section 4c of theâ Act). The Commission need not, however, prove both intent
to negate risk and intent to negate price competition; one or the other is sufficient to sustain a

 

self-certifying the Bitcoin swap for trading stated that ââ[a]s with all products listed for trading on
TeraExchange, trading in the USD/Bitcoin Swap will be subject to compliance with the Act,
Regulations and the TeraExchange Rulebook[.]â Therefore, Tera consented to the application of
the Act, including the prohibitions on wash trading and pre-arranged trading under Section 4c(a)
of the Act, to trading in the Bitcoin swap.

Section 4c(a) of the Act applies to transactions involving the purchase or sale of any
commodity for future delivery or swap that, inter alia, may be used to âhedge any transaction in
interstate commerce in the commodity|.]â As a non-deliverable forward contract, the Bitcoin
swap may be used to hedge transactions in interstate commerce in Bitcoin. Further, Bitcoin is a
commodity under Section la of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ la (2012), and is therefore subject as a
commodity to applicable provisions of the Act and Regulations.

Prearranged trading is also a form of fictitious sales. In the Matter of Gilchrist, [1990-

submitting trades to the open market while negating the risk of price competition incident to such
a market.â Harold Collins, [1986-1987 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) Â§ 22,982 at

(2d Cir. 1987). A series of transactions may constitute prearranged trading where â[e]ach
individual trade was initiated with the understanding that it would be matched such that, when
the prearranged transaction was complete, the...traders would have no market position and the
net financial position of the group would be zero.â Jn re Gimbel, [1987-1990 Transfer Binder]
Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) 4 24,213 at 35,004 (CFTC Apr. 14, 1988). The two accounts
involved in a trade do not need to be owned by the same individual or entity for the trade to
constitute a fictitious sale. See, e.g., Thomas Collins, [1996-1998 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut.
L. Rep. (CCH) { 27,194 at 45,743 (CFTC December 10, 1997).

a The October 8 Transactions Constitute Wash Trading and Prearranged
Trading

The October 8 transactions in the Bitcoin swap constitute wash trading. Trader A and
Trader B effected a wash result by the purchase and sale of the same product with the same tenor
and notional amount for the same price. Trader A and Trader B entered into the transaction
with the knowledge that the transactions were designed to achieve a wash result in a manner that
negated risk, as demonstrated in the Tera employeeâs October 7 email to Trader B that the trades
would have âno P/L consequences.â Because Trader A and Trader B were the only participants
in the Bitcoin swap market at the time of the transactions, neither bore any price risk as their
transactions would set the only prices in the market.

Further, Trader A and Trader B, as facilitated by Tera employees, prearranged the two
October 8 transactions. Trader A and Trader B initiated the transactions ââwith the understanding
that it would be matched such thatâ the net financial result would be a nullity. While Trader A
and Trader B did not communicate directly with each other regarding the two transactions,
Teraâs involvement allowed Trader A and Trader B to prearrange the transactions while negating
any market risk.

As a result, the October 8 transactions constitute both wash trading and prearranged
trading in violation of Section 4c(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6c(a) (2012).

 

, The tenor of a swap is the period of time that the swap is in effect. As such, tenor is

equivalent to the contract month of a futures contract.

6
4, Tera Failed to Deter, and in Fact Facilitated, Wash Trading and
Prearranged Trading in the Bitcoin Swap

Tera was obligated under Core Principle 2 to establish and enforce rules to prohibit wash
trading and prearranged trading on the SEF. Instead, Tera actively facilitated wash trading and
prearranged trading by bringing together two market participants with the express purpose of
entering into two offsetting transactions. Tera told Trader B that the transactions would be ââa
round-trip trade with the same price in, same price out, (i.e. no P/L [profit/loss]
consequences)[.]â Further, Tera employees were on the telephone with both Trader A and
Trader B during the October 8 transactions to help walk the traders through the transactions.

Tera also ensured that the two transactions would have no transaction costs by not
charging any fees to Trader A or Trader B. Tera assured Trader B that no custodian would be
required, meaning that neither party would be required to post collateral for the trades.

By failing to enforce its rules against wash trading, and in fact actively arranging a wash
trade, Tera failed to comply with its obligations under SEF Core Principle 2 and Regulation
37.203(a), 17 C.F.R Â§ 37.203(a) (2014). Further, as a result of the wash trading and prearranged
trading, Teraâs trading platform submitted reports of the two transactions to a swap data
repository which made the reports public. The reports of the two transactions created a
misleading impression of trading volume in the Bitcoin swap.â

IV.

FINDINGS OF VIOLATIONS

Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that Tera violated Section Sh(f)(2) of the
Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 7b-3(f)(2) (2012), and Regulation 37.203, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 37.203 (2014), on October

CFTC Settles with TeraExchange LLC for Failing to Enforce Prohibitions on Wash Trading
and Prearranged Trading in Bitcoin Swap

Washington, D.C. - The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today issued an Order filing and simultaneously
settling charges against TeraExchange LLC (Tera), a provisionally registered Swap Execution Facility (SEF), for failing to
enforce its prohibition on wash trading and prearranged trading on the SEF platform. The CFTC Order requires Tera to
cease and desist from future violations relating to its obligations to enforce rules on trade practices. Tera is based in
Summit, New Jersey.

Specifically, the CFTC Order finds that Tera offered for trading on its SEF a non-deliverable forward contract based on the
relative value of the U.S. Dollar and Bitcoin, a virtual currency (the Bitcoin Swap). On October 8, 2014, the only two
market participants authorized at that time to trade on Teraâs SEF entered into two transactions in the Bitcoin Swap. The
transactions were for the same notional amount, price, and tenor, and had the effect of completely offsetting each other.
At the time, these were the only transactions on Teraâs SEF.

Tera arranged for the two market participants to enter into the transactions. Tera brought together the market
participants, telling one that the trade would be âto test the pipes by doing a round-trip trade with the same price in,
same price out, (i.e. no P/L [profit/loss] consequences) no custodian required,â according to the Order.

However, subsequent to the transactions, Tera issued a press release and made statements at a meeting of the CFTCâs
Global Markets Advisory Committee (GMAC) announcing the transactions, creating the impression of actual trading
interest in the Bitcoin swap. Neither Teraâs press release nor the statements at the GMAC meeting indicated that the
October 8 transactions were pre-arranged wash sales executed for the purpose of testing Teraâs systems.

As a provisionally registered SEF, Tera is required under the SEF Core Principles of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA)
and CFTC Regulations to enact and enforce rules prohibiting certain types of trade practices on the SEF, including wash
trading and prearranged trading. Teraâs rulebook, in fact, prohibited those practices.

The CFTC noted in the Order that â[t]hese facts should be distinguished from a situation where a SEF or other designated
contract market runs pre-operational test trades to confirm that its systems are technically capable of executing
transactions and, to the extent that these simulated transactions become publicly known, makes it clear to the public
that the trades do not represent actual liquidity in the subject market.â

The CFTC appreciates the assistance of the Division of Market Oversight.

The Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Andrew Ridenour, Kim Bruno, Daniel Jordan, and
Rick Glaser.

I.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ) has reason to believe that
Respondent Cargill de MÃ©xico S.A. De C.V. (âCargill de MÃ©xicoâ) violated Section 4c(a)(1) of
the Commodity Exchange Act (âthe Actâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6c(a)(1) (2012),' and Commission
Regulation (âRegulationâ) 1.38(a), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.38(a) (2015) Therefore, the Commission deems
it appropriate and in the public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are,
instituted to determine whether Cargill de MÃ©xico engaged in the violations set forth herein and
to determine whether any order imposing remedial sanctions should be issued.

Il.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Cargill de MÃ©xico has
submitted an Offer of Settlement (âOfferâ), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Without admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, Cargill de MÃ©xico
consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 6(c) and 6(d) of
the Act, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (âOrderâ) and acknowledges
service of this Order.â

Il.

 

' Although Section 4c(a)(1)(A) was amended as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act, Pub. L. No. 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376 (2010) (codified as amended in scattered sections of 7, 12, and
15 U.S.C.), that amendment did not affect the operative language for the violations described in this Order.

* Cargill de MÃ©xico consents to the entry of this Order and to the use of these findings in this proceeding and in any
other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party; provided, however, that Cargill
de MÃ©xico does not consent to the use of the Offer, or the findings or conclusions in this Order consented to in the
Offer, as the sole basis for any other proceeding brought by the Commission, other than in a proceeding in
bankruptcy or to enforce the terms of this Order. Nor does Cargill de MÃ©xico consent to the use of the Offer or this
Order, or the findings or conclusions in this Order consented to in the Offer, by any other party in any other
proceeding.
TI.
The Commission finds the following:

A. SUMMARY

On multiple occasions between March 2010 and August 2014 Cargill de MÃ©xico engaged
in wash trades in certain agricultural futures products, including corn, soybeans and wheat, on
the Chicago Board of Trade (âCBOTâ) as well as in hard red wheat traded on the Kansas City
Board of Trade (âKCBTâ), which at the time was a designated contract market. Before orders for
these trades were entered on an exchange, employees of Cargill de MÃ©xico, either acting alone or
with another employee of Cargill de MÃ©xico, entered equal and opposite transactions in the same
futures product for another account that was also owned by Cargill de MÃ©xico, and matched the
product, quantity, price, and timing of those orders and trades. Further, by so structuring or
prearranging and entering these orders, which negated the risk incidental to an open and
competitive marketplace, Cargill de MÃ©xico also engaged in noncompetitive transactions in
violation of Regulation 1.38(a).

B. RESPONDENT

Cargill de MÃ©xico S.A. De C.V. is a Mexican corporation that, among other things,
trades in global futures markets in connection with Cargillâs Mexican agricultural import and
export business in grains and oilseeds. Cargill de MÃ©xico is not registered with the Commission
in any capacity.

Gs FACTS

On multiple occasions between April 2010 and August 2014 Cargill de MÃ©xico entered
into wash trades involving CBOT corn, soybean, and wheat futures contracts and KCBT hard red
wheat futures contracts. Cargill de MÃ©xico traders, acting either alone or with a colleague,
moved futures positions between accounts owned by Cargill de Mexico by entering into equal
and opposite transactions in the same contract, contract month, quantity, and price. They entered
the orders for these trades electronically and timed the order entry to be as close to
simultaneously as possibleâoften entering orders within less than a second.

Cargill de MÃ©xico maintains that it participated in these prearranged trades in order to
move hedging positions for its physical business among numerous accounts. Each account was
used to hedge physical trading conducted by Cargill de MÃ©xico, and each account was linked to a
particular source for the physical product. If the source of the physical product was later
changed because of availability, customer demand, or price, Cargill de MÃ©xico maintains that it
would, as a matter of internal policy, transfer the futures position to the account linked to the
new source of the physical product.

Cargill de MÃ©xico typically effected transfers between accounts by contacting its clearing
broker and effecting transfers pursuant to the policies of the clearing broker and the rules of a
designated contract market. However, in some instances, and in particular near or after the notice

2
date, its clearing broker would not make the back office transfers due to applicable contract
market rules. In these situations Cargill de MÃ©xico traders transferred the positions using the
market but did so in a non-competitive fashion by entering equal and opposite transactions.
Cargill de MÃ©xico entered into numerous such transactions beginning in March 2010 and
continuing into August 2014.

Upon being alerted by CME Group to concerns about its prearranged trading, Cargill de
MÃ©xico instituted a number of changes in its policies and procedures in order to prevent future
violations. Cargill de MÃ©xico has cooperated fully during this investigation.

D. LEGAL DISCUSSION

1. Cargill de MÃ©xico Entered into Wash Sales in Violation of
Section 4c(a)(1)(A) of the Act

Section 4c(a) of the Act makes it âunlawful for any person to offer to enter into, enter
into, or confirm the execution of a transactionâ that is or âis of the character of, or is commonly
known to the trade as, a âwash saleâ ...â 7 U.S.C. Â§6c(a). A wash sale is a form of fictitious sale.
In re Gimbel, [1987-1990 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) J 24,213 at 35,003
(CFTC Apr. 14, 1988).

In order to establish that a wash sale has occurred, it must initially be demonstrated that
the transaction at issue achieved a wash result. The Commission may demonstrate that the trades
resulted in a wash by showing â(1) the purchase and sale (2) of the same delivery month of the
same futures contract (3) at the same (or a similar) price.â Wilson v. CFTC, 322 F.3d 555, 559
(8th Cir. 2003) citing In re Gilchrist, [1990-1992 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) Â§
24,993 at 37,653 (CFTC Jan. 25, 1991); see also In re Citadel Trading, [1986-1987 Transfer
Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep (CCH) Â§ 23,082 at 32,190 (âOrders to purchase and sell for the
account of the same customer the identical quantity of the same futures contract at identical
prices were entered virtually simultaneously.â)

In addition to the factors enumerated in Gilchrist, intent must be proven to establish a
violation of Section 4c of the Act. Reddy v. CFTC, 191 F.3d 109, 119 (2d Cir. 1999), The intent
to negate risk or price competition and avoid a bona fide market position can properly be inferred
from prearrangement but it can also be inferred âfrom the intentional structuring of a transaction
in a manner to achieve the same result as prearrangement.â Jn re Three Eight Corp., [1992-1994
Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) 4 25,749 at 40,444 n.1S5 (CFTC Jun.16, 1993)
(citing In re Collins [1986-1987 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH)22,982 at 31,900-
O01 (CFTC Apr. 4, 1986), rev 'd on other grounds sub nom. Stoller vy. CFTC, 834 F.2d 262 (2d
Cir. 1987) (âCollinsââ)), The placement of offsetting orders to buy and sell, while simultaneously
taking steps to âenhance the likelihood that the buy and sell orders would be filled at the same or
a similar priceâ is persuasive evidence that the trader intends to negate risk and price
competition. Collins at J 31,900; see also In re Piasio, [1999-2000 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut.
L. Rep. (CCH) Â§ 28,276 at 50,685, 50,689-691 (CFTC Sep. 29, 2000) (finding customer who
placed paired buy and sell orders, with specific pricing and loss limitation instructions,
âstructured orders to negate riskâ and thus had intent to violate Section 4c), aff'd sub nom.
Piasio v. CFTC, [2002-2003 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) Â§ 29,251 (2d Cir.
Dec. 31, 2002).

The Cargill de MÃ©xico traders entered into trades for the purchase and sale in the same
delivery month of the same futures contract at the same prices, and thus achieved wash results.
Additionally, the Cargill de MÃ©xico traders knowingly entered into the purchase and sale of the
same delivery month of the same futures contracts at the same (or a similar) price for the
purpose of transferring positions between Cargill de MÃ©xico accounts. In doing so, Cargill de
MÃ©xico violated Section 4c(a)(2)(A) of the Act by entering into transactions of the character of
and commonly known as wash sales.

2. Cargill de MÃ©xico Executed Noncompetitive Trades in Violation of
Commission Regulation 1.38(a)

Regulation 1.38(a) requires that all purchases and sales of commodity futures be executed
âopenly and competitively.â The purpose of this requirement is to ensure that all trades are
executed at competitive prices and that all trades are directed into a centralized marketplace to
participate in the competitive determination of the price of futures contracts. Noncompetitive
trades are generally transacted in accordance with express or implied agreements or
understandings between and among the traders. See, e.g., In re Gilchrist, [1990-1992 Transfer
Binder] Comm, Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) Â§ 24,993 at 37,652 (CFTC Jan. 25, 1991). Noncompetitive
trades are also a type of fictitious sale because they negate the risk incidental to an open and
competitive market. Jn re Fisher, Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) at 56,052 n.11. Prearranged
trading is a form of anti-competitive trading that violates Regulation 1.38(a). Jn re Shell US
Trading Co., [2005-2007 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) Â§ 30,161 at 57,632
(CFTC Jan. 4, 2006); In re Gimbel, [1987-1990 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH)
4 24,213 at 35,003 (CFTC Apr. 14, 1988), aff'd as to liability, 872 F.2d 196 (7th Cir. 1989).

By knowingly structuring and entering into prearranged noncompetitive trades, Cargill de
MÃ©xico violated Commission Regulation 1.38(a).

CFTC Orders Cargill de MÃ©xico SA De CV to Pay $500,000 for Unlawfully Executing Wash
Sales on the CBOT and KCBT

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today issued an Order filing and
simultaneously settling charges against commodities trading company Cargill de MÃ©xico SA De CV (Cargill de MÃ©xico)
for executing wash trades involving corn, soybean, and wheat futures contracts on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT)
and wheat futures contracts on the Kansas City Board of Trade (KCBT). The CFTC order requires that Cargill de MÃ©xico
pay a $500,000 civil monetary penalty.

The Order finds that on multiple occasions between March 2010 and August 2014 Cargill de MÃ©xico engaged in wash
sales and unlawful non-competitive transactions in certain agricultural futures products, including corn, soybeans, and
wheat on the CBOT, as well as in hard red wheat traded on the KCBT. Before orders for these trades were entered on an
exchange, Cargill de MÃ©xico employees, either acting alone or with another employee, entered equal and opposite
transactions in the same futures contract for another account that was also owned by Cargill de MÃ©xico, and matched the
product, quantity, price, and timing of those orders and trades. The Order finds that by so prearranging, structuring, and
entering these orders, which negated the risk incidental to an open and competitive marketplace, Cargill de MÃ©xico also
engaged in noncompetitive transactions.

In addition to imposing the $500,000 civil monetary penalty, the Order also requires Cargill de MÃ©xico to comply with
certain undertakings. First, the Order requires Cargill de MÃ©xico to conduct training for certain personnel addressing the
ethics, compliance, and legal requirements of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC regulations with regard to
prearranged, fictitious, or noncompetitive trading. Second, the Order requires Cargill de MÃ©xico to submit a report to the
CFTCâs Division of Enforcement representing (i) that Cargill de MÃ©xico has adopted policies and procedures designed to
prevent any potential prearranged, fictitious, or noncompetitive trading in violation of the CEA and CFTC regulations, (ii)
that Cargill de MÃ©xico has conducted certain training sessions for relevant personnel, and (iii) that Cargill de MÃ©xico has
begun using the self-match prevention technology available on the front end system provided by its primary clearing
firm. Finally, the Order requires Cargill de MÃ©xico to cease and desist from further violations of Section 4c(a)(1) of the
CEA and CFTC Regulation 1.38(a), as charged.

The CFTC thanks the CME Group, Inc. for its assistance in this matter.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Trevor Kokal, James G. Wheaton, Lenel Hickson
Jr., and Manal M. Sultan.

Defendants.

 

 

Plaintiff, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCFTCâ or âCommissionâ), by

and through its attorneys, alleges as follows:
I, SUMMARY

I, From at least October 2010 through December 2013 (the âRelevant Periodâ),
Defendants John H. Won, Sungmi Kang, Tae Hung Kang (a/k/a âKevin Kangâ), Safety Capital
Management, Inc. (âSafetyâ) and GNS Capital, Inc. ââGNSâ) (collectively d/b/a
âFOREXNPOWER?â), directly or through their officers, employees or agents, while acting as
commodity trading advisors (âCTAsâ) and commodity pool operators (âCPOsâ), fraudulently
solicited customers and prospective customers for the purported purpose of trading a pooled
investment in connection with agreements, contracts, or transactions in off-exchange foreign
currency (âforexâ) and/or to open retail forex accounts purportedly managed by either Safety or
GNS. In furtherance of the fraudulent scheme, Defendants made material misrepresentations and

omissions in solicitations to actual and prospective customers, including but not limited to falsely

 
Case 1:15-cv-05551 Document 1 Filed 09/24/15 Page 2 of 29 PagelD #: 2

guaranteeing 10% profits per month with no risk of loss. Rather than trading forex on their
customersâ behalf, Defendants misappropriated customersâ funds for Defendantsâ personal use
and benefit, and operated as a âPonziâ scheme by paying customers from the funds of other
customers.

2. During the Relevant Period, Defendants Safety and GNS, by and through their
officers, employees or agents, fraudulently solicited and accepted over $1.5 million from over 90
customers, who were neither eligible contract participants (âECPsâ) nor eligible commercial
entities (ââECEsâ), for both the forex commodity pool and individually managed retail forex
accounts,

3, Total deposits by Safety and GNSâs pool participants into the forex commodity
pool were approximately $718,000. Of this amount, Defendants Sungmi Kang and John Won
misappropriated over $622,000 from at least 37 pool participants, and used the funds for personal
and business expenses rather than for forex trading. Total deposits by Safety and GNSâs
managed retail forex account customers were approximately $845,000 from at least 50
customers. These retail forex customers lost a total of nearly $400,000 in these managed retail
forex accounts, while Safety and GNS were compensated for purportedly managing and trading
the accounts.

4, During the Relevant Period, Defendant Tae Hung Kang personally solicited both
individually managed retail forex account customers and forex pool participants by, among other
misrepresentations, making false guarantees of 10% âprofit per month without risk of loss when,
in reality, Safety and GNSâs customers had lost money in the forex commodity pool and in the

managed retail forex accounts.

 
Case 1:15-cv-05551 Document1 Filed 09/24/15 Page 3 of 29 PagelD #: 3

5, During the Relevant Period, Defendants Safety and GNS also failed to operate the
commodity pool asa separate legal entity â by receiving pool funds in Safety or GNSâs name
rather than the name of the commodity pool, and by commingling pool funds with non-pool
property â and failed to register with the Commission as commodity pool operators (âCPOsâ) .
and commodity trading advisors (âCTASâ),

6, By virtue of this conduct and the conduct further described herein, Defendants,
either directly or as controlling persons, have engaged, are engaging, or are about to engage in
acts and practices in violation of Sections 2(c)(2)(C)(iii)(D)(aa)-(cc), 4b(a)(2)(A) and (C), 4m(1),
and 40(1)(A)-(B) of the Commodity Exchange Act (the âActâ) as amended, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§
2(c)(2)(C)(iii)()(aa)-(ce), 6b(a)(2)(A) and (C), 6m(1), and 60(1)(A)-(B)(2014), and Commission
Regulations (âRegulationsâ) 4.20(a)-(c), 5.2(b), and 5,3(a)(2)-(3), 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 4.20(a)-(c),
5.2(b), and 5.3(a)(2)-(3).

7, Moreover, in October 2014, Defendant GNS failed to respond to a Commission
subpoena requesting documents. By this conduct, GNS violated Commission Regulation 1.31,
17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.31 (2014).

8. During the Relevant Period, Defendants Sungmi Kang, Tae Hung Kang, and John
Won were officers, employees and agents of Safety. Therefore, Safety is liable for the acts and
omissions of Sungmi Kang, Tae Hung Kang, and John Won done in the scope of their
employment or office, pursuant to Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(a)(1)(B), and
Regulation 1.2, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.2.

9, During the Relevant Period, Defendants John Won and Sungmi Kang were

officers, employees and agents of GNS. Therefore, GNS is liable for the acts and omissions of

 
Case 1:15-cv-05551 Document 1 Filed 09/24/15 Page 4 of 29 PagelD #: 4

John Won and Sungmi Kang done in the scope of their employment or office, pursuant to
Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(a)(1)(B), and Regulation 1.2, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.2.

10. Defendant Sungmi Kang was a controlling person of Safety throughout the
Relevant Period and did not act in good faith or knowingly induced Safetyâs violations of the Act
and Regulations described herein. Therefore, Sungmi Kang is liable for Safetyâs violations of
the Act and Regulations, pursuant to Section 13(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13c(b).

11, Defendants John Won and Sungmi Kang were controlling persons of GNS
throughout the Relevant Period and did not act in good faith or knowingly induced GNSâs
violations of the Act and Regulations. Therefore, John Won and Sungmi Kang are liable for
GNSâs violations of the Act and Regulations, pursuant to Section 13(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§
13c(b).

12. Accordingly, pursuant to Section 6c of the Act, as amended, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1
(2012), and Section 2(c)(2)(C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(c)(2)(C) (2012), the Commission brings
this action to enjoin Defendantsâ unlawful acts and practices, to compel their compliance with
the Act and the Regulations promulgated thereunder, and to enjoin them from engaging in any
commodity related activity. In addition, the Commission seeks civil monetary penalties and
remedial ancillary relief, including, but not limited to, trading and registration bans, restitution,
disgorgement, rescission, pre- and post-judgment interest, and such other and further relief as the
Court may deem necessary and appropriate.

13. Unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, Defendants will likely continue to
engage in acts and practices alleged in this Complaint and similar acts and practices, as described

below.

14. â Section 6c(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C, Â§ 13a-1 (2012), authorizes the Commission to
seek injunctive and other relief against any person whenever it shall appear to the Commission
that such person has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in any act or practice
constituting a violation of any provision of the Act, or any rule, regulation, or order thereunder.

15. The CFTC has jurisdiction over the conduct and forex transactions at issue in this
case pursuant to Section 2(c)(2)(C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C, Â§Â§ 2(c)(2)(C).

16. | Venue lies properly with this Court pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.
Â§ 13a-1(e) (2012), because Defendants resided and/or transacted business in this District, several

Vv. EACTS
A, Defendantsâ Fraudulent Solicitation and Misappropriation

34. During the Relevant Period, Safety and GNS (collectively d/b/a
FOREXNPOWER), by and through their officers, employees or agents, fraudulently solicited
customers and potential customers to invest in a commodity pool for forex trading and/or to open
retail forex trading accounts purportedly managed by Safety and GNS. The fraudulent
solicitation included, but was not limited to, misrepresentations by the Defendants that
FOREXNPOWER had a âsecret trading methodâ called ASET that guaranteed customers would
obtain a âmonthly profit rate of 10%;â that investors âwill not lose their money at all, not even
$1;â and that customers would make $100,000 with only a $500 investment. These
misrepresentations of guaranteed profits and no risk were false and misleading, as none of
Defendantsâ customers had ever obtained 10% monthly profits, and many of the customers
experienced large losses.

35. Defendants Safety and GNS, by and through their officers, employees or agents,
made the misrepresentations in advertisements placed in Korean language newspapers, on their
website www.forexnpower.com, in written solicitation materials, and at seminars they hosted in

Queens, New York.

 
Case 1:15-cv-05551 Document 1 Filed 09/24/15 Page 10 of 29 PageiD #: 10

36. At the seminars that Defendants Safety and GNS hosted during the Relevant
Period, their principals, employees and agents, including Defendant Tae Hung Kang, made
similar fraudulent statements to customers and prospective customers,

37, For example, on or about March 15, 2012, Defendant Tae Hung Kang solicited
pool participants and retail forex customers at a FOREXNPOWER seminar and represented that
he was the CEO of the company and that the ASET program would in 5 years turn a $3,000
investment into over $900,000 in profits.

38, On another occasion, in or around the summer of 2012, Defendant Tae Hung
Kang, again representing himself as the CEO of FOREXNPOWER, falsely stated to a customer
that the company had yielded 10% profits per month and encouraged the customer to invest
because this was a âlifetime opportunityâ and the customer should ânot miss out.â After this
customer invested, he requested a withdrawal. Tae Hung Kang told the customer that he could
pay the customer back in few weeks because the company was expecting an investment from
another investor, This latter representation is consistent with a Ponzi scheme in which investors
are paid with other investorsâ money.

39, In yet another false solicitation, in an email dated January 11, 2013, Defendants
Safety and GNS, using the d/b/a FOREXNPOWER, by and through their officers, employees or
agents, represented to customers that during the entire month of December 2012, all their
managed forex trading accounts had made a profit of 10% on average. On the contrary, during
this period, the majority of FOREXNPOWERâS managed retail forex customer accounts lost
money,

40, Through the false solicitations described above, Defendants Safety and GNS, by

and through their officers, employees, and agents, fraudulently solicited and obtained

10

 
Case 1:15-cv-05551 Document 1 Filed 09/24/15 Page 11 of 29 PagelD #: 11

approximately $718,000 from at least 37 persons to invest in a forex commodity pool. The
majority of pool funds were deposited into Safetyâs bank account (which was controlled by
Defendant Sungmi Kang). GNS also received in its bank account (controlled by Defendants
John Won and Sungmi Kang) at least $50,000 from a pool participant.

41. Defendant Sungmi Kang was the sole signatory of Safetyâs bank account.
Defendants John Won and Sungmi Kang were both signatories on GNSâs bank account.

42. Defendants Safety and GNS, by and through their officers, employees or agents,
represented to pool participants that they would use pool funds to trade retail off-exchange forex
transactions on behalf of the participants. In fact, the majority of pool funds were not used for
forex trading but for Defendantsâ personal and business expenses.

43, Defendants Sungmi Kang and John Won, through their control over Safetyâs and
GNSâs bank accounts, misappropriated over $622,000 in pool participantsâ funds for personal
and business expenses, including cash withdrawals, checks to their personal bank accounts,
entertainment and meals, and Ponzi payments (i.e., payments of purported trading profits to
investors using funds of other investors). In total, Defendants Safety and GNS, collectively, paid
at least $80,000 in Ponzi payments.

44, Defendants, either directly or as controlling persons, did not disclose to the pool
participants that the majority of their funds were actually misappropriated and never used for
forex trading. Defendants John Won and Sungmi Kang knew or should have known the majority
of pool funds were misappropriated and not used for forex trading because they controlled Safety

and records in a form specified by any representative of the Commission. Such production shall
be made at the expense of the person required to keep the book or record, to a Commission
representative upon the representative's request.

108. From October 21, 2013 to the present, GNS has been registered with the
Commission as a CTA and CPO.

109. On or about July 24, 2014, the Commissionâs Division of Enforcement served a
document subpoena on GNS (returnable on August 4, 2014). John Won, the principal of GNS,
acknowledged receipt of this subpoena to Commission staff. However, GNS never responded to
the subpoena or produced its books and records, and thus GNS violated Commission Regulation
1.31,17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.31,

110. John Won, who controlled the bank and trading accounts of GNS, held and
exercised direct and indirect control over GNS and either did not act in good faith or knowingly
induced GNSâs violations of Regulation 1.3, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.3. John Won is therefore also liable
for GNSâs violations as a controlling person pursuant to Section 13(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§

13c(b).

CFTC Charges New York Corporations Safety Capital Management, Inc. and GNS Capital,
Inc., both d/b/a FOREXNPOWER, and New York City Residents John Won, Sungmi Kang,
and Tae Hung (âKevinâ) Kang with Fraudulently Soliciting More than $1.5 Million ina
Forex Fraud Scheme

Defendants Sungmi Kang and John Won Are Also Charged with
Misappropriation of over $622,000 of Customer Funds

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) filed an enforcement action in the U.S.
District Court for the Eastern District of New York, charging Defendants Safety Capital Management, Inc. (Safety) and
GNS Capital, Inc. (GNS), both doing business as FOREXNPOWER, John Won, a controlling person of GNS, and Sungmi
Kang, a controlling person of both Safety and GNS, with, among other charges, fraudulent solicitation of over $1.5 million
from customers to trade off-exchange foreign currency (forex) and misappropriation of over $622,000 of customer funds.
Defendant Tae Hung Kang (a/k/a Kevin Kang), an officer and agent of Safety and GNS, is charged with fraudulent
solicitation of customers.

The CFTC Complaint alleges that from at least October 2010 through December 2013, Safety and GNS fraudulently
solicited and accepted over $1.5 million from over 90 retail customers to participate in a forex commodity pool and/or to
open forex trading accounts managed by Safety or GNS.

Specifically, the Complaint alleges that Safety and GNS made material false representations in their solicitations of
customers, including that (1) FOREXNPOWER had a âsecret trading methodâ that guaranteed customers would obtain a
âmonthly profit rate of 10%,â (2) investors âwill not lose their money at all, not even $1;â and (3) customers would make
$100,000 with only a $500 investment.

Defendants solicited customers through advertisements in Korean language newspapers, on their website, in written
solicitation materials, and at seminars in Queens, New York. The Complaint also alleges that Tae Hung Kang falsely
represented that Safety and GNS had and would obtain 10% profits per month without any risk of loss; however, forex
pool participants and retail forex customer accounts managed by the companies had never earned such profits and had
in fact lost money.

In addition, the Complaint charges Safety, GNS, Won, and Sungmi Kang with commingling commodity pool funds with
non-pool property, failing to operate a commodity pool as a separate entity, receiving pool participantsâ funds in Safety
or GNSâs name rather than in the name of the commodity pool, and failing to register Safety and GNS with the CFTC as
Commodity Pool Operators (CPOs) and Commodity Trading Advisors (CTAs), as required. The Complaint also charges that
GNS and Won with failing to produce documents at the request of CFTC staff made after GNS had become registered as a
CPO and a CTA.

In its continuing litigation, the CFTC seeks, among other relief, restitution to defrauded customers, disgorgement of ill-
gotten gains, civil monetary penalties, permanent trading and registration bans, and a permanent injunction against
further violations by the Defendants of the federal commodities laws, as charged.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Linda Y. Peng, W. Derek Shakabpa, Christopher
Giglio, David Acevedo, David W. MacGregor, Lenel Hickson, Jr., and Manal M. Sultan.

A. Findings of Fact
The Parties to this Consent Order

14,â Plaintiff U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the âCFTCâ or
âCommissionâ) is an independent federal regulatory agency charged by Congress with the
responsibility for administering and enforcing the Commodity Exchange Act (the âActâ),

7 U.S.C. Â§ 1 ef seg. (2012), and the Regulations promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1.1 et seg.
(2014).

15. Defendant Futures International LLC (âFTâ) is an Illinois limited liability
company formed in August 2004 with a primary business address at 190 South LaSalle Street,
Suite 1720, Chicago, Illinois, FI is an Introducing Broker (âIBâ) that trades agricultural futures
and options on the CBOT floor of the CBOT and on Globex, CBOTâs electronic trading
platform, including futures contracts in soybeans, soybean meal, soybean oil, and the soybean
âcrushâ spread (a spread trade involving buying or selling soybean futures contracts and
simultaneously selling (or buying) soybean meal and soybean oil futures contracts), During the
relevant period (i.e., January 2009 through November 2012), FI was one of (if not the) largest

ilure to Maintain Complete and Accurate B 5 of Futu ransactions

17. Section 4g(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6g(a) (2012), provides that every person
registered as a futures commission merchant, IB, floor broker, or floor trader is required to keep
books and records pertaining to transactions and positions of their customers and commodities
for future delivery, and to make such records available for inspection by the Commission.

18. Regulation 1.35(a), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.35(a) (2013), requires IBs to keep âfull,
complete, and systematic records, together with all pertinent data. and memoranda, of all
transactions relating to its business of dealing in commodity futures...â Regulation 1.35(a-1),
17 C.F.R, Â§ 1.35(a-1) (2014), further requires that any IB receiving a customer order âshall
immediately upon receipt thereof prepare a written record of the orderâ and shall record, by
timestamp or other device, the date and time, to the nearest minute, that the order is received.

19, Regulation 1.31, 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 1.31 (2014), provides that âall books and records
required to be kept by the Act or by these regulations shall be kept for a period of five years from
the date thereof and shall be readily accessible during the first 2 years of the 5-year period.â

20. âIn order to preserve an audit trail for the exchange and its members, floor brokers
and floor traders are also required to record the time bracket on each executed order ticket, The
time bracket is a letter or symbol corresponding to specific fifteen-minute time increments within
a trading session. The bracketing system helps to pinpoint within a fifteen-minute window the
time that a trade occurred.

21. Beginning in at least 2009 and continuing until 2012, FI failed to record all
customer orders immediately upon receipt and further failed to retain full, complete, and

systematic records of all transactions relating to its business of dealing in commodity futures.
22. Instead of completing order tickets documenting order instructions at the time the
order was received, FI employees often recorded order information only after the order was
executed or âfilled.â

23. To ensure the timestamps on FI floor order tickets did not conflict with other
timing information collected and maintained by the CME, FI employees timestamped blank
order tickets throughout each dayâs trading session. FI employees were then able to select pre-
timestamped order tickets reflecting a time that appeared consistent with the orderâs execution
time, regardless of when the order was received.

24. Because of its failure to immediately document orders in accordance with
Regulation 1.35(a-1), as well as its use of pre-timestamped order tickets, some of FIâs order
tickets bore false information regarding the time at which orders were received.

25. Cerrone knew FI employees were pre-timestamping blank order tickets and using
those tickets to document trades after execution,

26. During the relevant time period, FI employees communicated electronically and
on personal devices about FI transactions involving commodity futures and/or options, including
by use of instant messages, FI, did not, however, retain all instant messages that related to its
business involving commodity futures transactions,

27. Cerrone knew FI employees conducted firm business through electronic
communications and he was responsible for collecting relevant instant messages until at least
August 2011.

28. FI did not retain all of its instant messages involving commodity futures

transactions during the relevant period.
29,  FIâs inability to produce full, complete, and accurate order tickets and instant
messages resulted in an incomplete and unreliable audit trail that hindered the Commissionâs
ability to investigate violations of the Act and Regulations.

Submissio. False t

30. Section 9(a)(4) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13(a)(4) (2012), prohibits:
Any person willfully to falsify, conceal, or cover up by any trick, scheme, or

artifice a material fact, make any false, fictitious, or fraudulent statements or
representations, or make or use any false writing or document knowing the same
to contain any false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry to a registered
entity, board of trade, or futures association designed or registered under this Act
acting in furtherance of its official duties under this Act.

31. Asaresult of FIâs order ticket practices described above, FI submitted certain
order tickets with false information to the clearing futures commission merchant (âFCMâ) for
keypunching and that information was transmitted to CME Clearing.

32. FI knew that information from its order tickets would be keypunched and
subsequently transmitted to CME Clearing.

Unauthorized Tr:

33. Regulation 166.2, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 166.2 (2014), prohibits an IB or any of its
associated persons from effecting a transaction on behalf of a customer without first obtaining
from the customer or the person designated to control the account: (1) â[t}he precise commodity
interest to be purchased or sold; and (2) [t]he exact amount of the commodity interest to be
purchased or soldâ if the customer has not executed a written power of attorney.

34. Throughout the relevant time period, FI did not obtain any written powers of

attorney to trade its customer accounts.
Mase: lii4-cv-O787? Document # 32 Fileck O9/21/15 Page S of 18 Pagelt #222
(

35. FI nonetheless executed trades on occasion without first receiving instructions
from its customers as to the precise commodity interest to be purchased and the amount to be
purchased.

36. In some instances, FI employees executed or directed the execution of trades
based on customer order instructions that failed to specify the contract month the customer
wanted to trade and/or the amount of the commodity interest to be purchased.

37, At other times during the relevant time period, FI employees executed trades
without knowing what customer, if any, would eventually accept the trade. One FI employee
contacted customers after execution to determine whether they wanted a trade attributed to their
account.

38. | On occasions where one FI employee was unable to find a customer willing to
accept an executed trade, that employee assigned the trade (or directed another FI employee to
assign the trade) to an account designated for error trades or to a personal account maintained by
him.

39,  FIâs improper use of pre-timestamped floor order tickets enabled the allocation of
trades subsequent to their execution.

Failure to Supervise

40. Regulation 166.3, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 166.3 (2013), requires:

Each Commission registrant, except an associate person who has no supervisory
duties, must diligently supervise the handling by its partners, officers, employees
and agents (or other persons occupying a similar status or performing a similar
function) of all commodity interest accounts carried, operated, advised or
introduced by the registrant and all other activities of its partners, officers,
employees, and agents (or other persons occupying a similar status or performing
a similar function) relating to its business as a registrant.

41. | Throughout the relevant time period, FI and Cerrone were both registered with the

Commission, and Cerrone had supervisory duties at FI.

 
Case: idÃ©d-cv-07877 Document @ 32 Filed: OG/21/15 Page 10 of 18 Pageld #223
|

42, Notwithstanding their supervisory obligations, FI and Cerrone: (1) failed to
establish written policies and procedures governing trading floor operations until at least
September 2012; (ii) failed to provide adequate training to employees despite hiring some
individuals without industry experience; and (ili) failed to implement adequate policies and
practices to ensure compliance with the Act and Regulations, including the practices described
above.

43, For example, prior to September 2012, FI did not maintain written policies or
procedures governing its trading or floor operations, including order intake, preparation of order
tickets, handling error trades, trade execution, priority of customer orders, and recordkeeping.

44, â FIâs compliance officer at the time was not experienced in floor operations, did
not observe FIâs trading floor practices and did not review FIâs policies or procedures relating to
order ticket processes. |

45. Instead, another FI employee was identified as responsible for ensuring
compliance with Commission Rules and Regulations regarding trading desk activities and the
order ticketing process, but that employee did not know that she bore such responsibilities and
she was principally involved in FIâs practice of pre-timestamping floor order tickets throughout
the trading day.

| 46. Throughout the relevant time period, neither FI nor Cerrone acted diligently to
ensure that FI employees were aware of, and complied with, the requirements of the Act and
Regulations, and neither diligently supervised FIâs trading floor and order ticket processes.
B. Conclusions of Law

Jurisdiction and Venue

47. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 6c of the Act,

7 U.S.C. Â§ 13a-1 (2012), which provides that whenever it appears to the CFTC that any person

10
Case: Ddd-cyv-0787? Docurnent 4: 32 Fiiec: OOf/21/15 Page 11 of 18 Pageip a:224
(

has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a violation of

any provision of the Act or any rule, regulation, or order promulgated thereunder, the CFTC may
bring an action in the proper district court of the United States against such person to enjoin such
act or practice, or to enforce compliance with the Act, or any rule, regulation or order thereunder,

48, Venue properly lies with this Court pursuant to Section 6c(e) of the Act, 7 U.S.C,
Â§ 13a-1(e) (2012), because the Defendants reside in this jurisdiction and the acts and practices in
violation of the Act occurred within this District.

49, â_ By the conduct described in paragraphs 17 through 32 above, FI, through
employees acting on its behalf, violated Section 9(a)(4) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13(a)(4) (2012),
by willfully submitting order tickets for keypunching to CME Clearing with false timestamp
information to a registered entity, board of trade, or futures association.

50. By the conduct described in paragraphs 17 through 29 above, FI, through
employees acting on its behalf, violated Section 4g(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6(a) (2012), and
Regulations 1.31 and 1.35(a) by failing to maintain for the requisite period full, complete, and
systematic records of all transactions relating to its business of dealing in commodity futures,
including, but not limited to, its order tickets and instant messages.

51, Cerrone controlled FI and did not act in good faith or knowingly induced, directly
or indirectly, the acts constituting FIâs recordkeeping violations. Specifically, FIâs violations of
Section 4g(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6(a) (2012), and Regulations 1.31 and 1.35(a). Cerrone is
therefore liable for those violations as a controlling person pursuant to Section 13(b) of the Act,
7 USS.C. Â§ 13(c)(b) (2012),

52. By the conduct described in paragraphs 17 through 29 above, FI, through

employees and principals acting on its behalf, violated Section 4g(a) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6(a)

11
 

(2012), and Regulation 1.35(a-1) by failing to prepare written records of orders immediately

upon receipt, and instead documenting orders later in the day, at times after execution, and often
using pre-timestamped order tickets.

53, By the conduct described in paragraphs 17 through 39 above, FI, through an
employee and principal acting on its behalf, violated Regulation 166.2, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 166.2 (2014),
by placing orders without obtaining specific information from customers regarding the quantity
and/or the precise commodity interest to be purchased or sold.

54. By the conduct described in paragraphs 17 through 36 above, FI, through
employees and principals acting on its behalf, and Cerrone violated Regulation 166.3, 17 C.F.R.
Â§ 166.3 (2014), by, among other things: (i) failing to establish written policies and procedures
governing trading floor operations until at least September 201 1; (ii) failing to provide adequate
training to employees despite hiring some individuals without industry experience; and
(iii) failing to implement adequate policies and practices and/or diligently supervise FI
employees to ensure compliance with the Act and Regulations.

55. Cerrone is a registrant with supervisory responsibilities at Fl. Cerrone controlled
FI and did not act in good faith or knowingly induced, directly or indirectly, the acts and/or
omissions constituting FIâs violations of Regulation 166.3, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 166.3 (2014), and is
therefore liable for those violations directly and as a controlling person pursuant to Section 13(b) |
of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13(c)(b) (2012).

56. Because the foregoing acts, omissions, and failures of FI employees and
principals occurred within the scope of their employment, office, or agency, FI is liable for those

acts, omissions, and failures constituting violations of the Act and Regulations pursuant to

12

57, Unless restrained and enjoined by this Court, there is a reasonable likelihood that

the Defendants will continue to engage in the acts and practices alleged in the Complaint,

UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE

","Release Number 7246-15

 

September 25, 2015

Federal Court in Illinois Orders Futures International LLC and its Chief Operating Officer,
Amedeo Cerrone, to Pay $500,000 Penalty for Recordkeeping Violations, False Statements,
Unauthorized Trading, and Supervision Failures

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced that Judge Robert W.
Gettleman of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois entered a Consent Order settling CFTC charges
against Defendants Chicago-based Futures International LLC (Fl) and its Chief Operating Officer Amedeo Cerrone of
St. Charles, Illinois, for failing to adequately record customer orders; failing to maintain required records relating to
commodity futures transactions; submitting order tickets bearing false timestamps; unauthorized trading; and failing to
provide adequate supervision. Fl is a registered Introducing Broker. The Order requires Fl and Cerrone jointly to pay a
civil monetary penalty of $500,000.

The Courtâs Order stems from a CFTC Amended Complaint filed October 9, 2014 (see CFTC Press Release and Amended
Complaint 7034-14, October 9, 2014).

The Order finds that, between January 2009 and November 2012, FI failed to record all customer orders immediately
upon receipt, as required by CFTC Regulations, and that Fl employees instead often recorded order information only after
orders were executed. In particular, the Order finds, with Cerroneâs knowledge, Fl employees routinely timestamped
blank order tickets and then used these âpre-timestampedâ tickets to document trades, making it appear as though FI
had complied with the applicable recordkeeping requirements. Ultimately, Flâs order tickets with false timestamp
information were transmitted to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange for clearing, according to the Order.

The Order also finds that Fl employees communicated electronically about commodity futures transactions, including via
instant messages. Although Cerrone knew this and was responsible for collecting such communications, FI failed to
maintain full and complete records of these communications, in violation of CFTC Regulations, according to the Order.
The failure to retain all electronic communications relating to Flâs commodity futures transactions resulted in an
incomplete audit trail hindering the CFTCâs ability to investigate violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and
CFTC Regulations, the Order finds.

Additionally, according to the Order, Fl, through one of its principals, improperly exercised discretion over commercial
customersâ accounts without written powers of attorney and executed trades without first receiving instructions from
customers as to the commodity to be purchased and the amount. At times, Fl employees executed trades without
knowing whether any customer would even accept the trade.

The Order further finds that Fl did not have written policies and procedures regarding trading floor operations until at
least September 2012 and that Fl and Cerrone did not provide adequate training to employees. Additionally, they failed
to implement policies and procedures to ensure compliance with the CEA and CFTC Regulations.

In addition to requiring Fl and Cerrone to pay a civil monetary penalty of $500,000, the Order also permanently prohibits
Fl and Cerrone from further violations of the CEA and CFTC Regulations, as charged.

On October 9, 2014, the CFTC filed and settled charges against Kent Woods, Flâs former Chief Executive Officer, for
violations arising from the same underlying facts (see CFTC Press Release and Order 7034-14, October 9, 2014). The
Order in that action requires Woods to pay a $200,000 civil monetary penalty, to cooperate in any related action, and to
execute all non-electronic orders only through his current employerâs floor desk for two years. The Order also
permanently prohibits Woods from further violations of the CEA and CFTC Regulations, as charged.

The CFTC thanks and acknowledges the assistance of the CME Group, Inc. in this matter.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Allison Passman, Daniel Burstein, Joseph
Patrick, Theodore Polley, Susan Gradman, Scott Williamson, and Rosemary Hollinger. Samantha Coxe also assisted in
this matter.

ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTIONS 6(c) AND 6(d) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT,
MAKING FINDINGS AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

I.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ) has reason to believe that
Global Consortiums, LLC (âGlobal Consortiumsâ) and its sole owner, Chief Executive Officer
(âCEOâ), and President, Michael E. Simmons (âSimmonsâ) (collectively, âRespondentsââ)
violated Sections 4b(a)(2)(A)-(C), 4k(2), 4m(1), and 40(1)(A) and (B) of the Commodity
Exchange Act (the âActâ), 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6b(a)(2)(A)-(C), 6k(2), 6m(1), and 60(1), and
Commission Regulations 3.12(a), and 5.2(b)(1)-(3), 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 3.12(a), and 5.2(b)(1)-(3).
Therefore, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest that public
administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted to determine whether Respondents
engaged in the violations set forth herein and to determine whether any order should be issued
imposing remedial sanctions,

Il.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Respondents have
submitted an Offer of Settlement (âOfferâ), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Without admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, Respondents consent to
the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 6(c) and 6(d) of the
Commodity Exchange Act, Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (âOrderââ) and
acknowledge service of this Order.'

 

' Respondents consent to the entry of this Order and to the use of these findings in this proceeding and in any other
proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party; provided, however, that Respondents
do not consent to the use of the Offer, or the findings or conclusions in this Order consented to in the Offer, as the
sole basis for any other proceeding brought by the Commission, other than in a proceeding in bankruptcy or to

 
Til,
The Commission finds the following:
A. SUMMARY

From at least March 2010 through July 2012 (the âRelevant Periodâ), Simmons and a
company he solely owned, Global Consortiums, fraudulently solicited and accepted at least
$435,985 from at least ten individuals to make pooled investments in retail off-exchange foreign
currency transactions (âretail forex transactionsâ), but never traded foreign currency for their
investors. Respondents created and distributed account statements to investors that falsely
claimed that Respondents had engaged on behalf of investors in retail forex transactions that
were profitable. Although Respondents later partially repaid some of their investors,
Respondents did not repay a balance of at least $229,660 that they still owe to their investors.
Respondents without authorization or disclosure used investor funds for non-investment
purposes and thus misappropriated at least $217,160 of investorsâ funds. Respondents also failed
to register Global Consortiums as a commodity pool operator (âCPOâ) and Simmons as an
associated person (âAPâ) of that CPO, as they were required to do.

B. RESPONDENTS

Global Consortiums is a Georgia limited liability company formed by Simmons in June
2009, The company operated from Simmonsâ residence in Fayetteville, Georgia. The company
has never been registered with the Commission in any capacity.

Simmons is an individual residing in Fayetteville, Georgia. He is the CEO, President,
âand sole owner of Global Consortiums and is responsible for all of the companyâs activities.
Simmons has never been registered with the Commission in any capacity,

C. FACTS

During the Relevant Period, Simmons and Global Consortiums, a company he solely
owned and of which he is CEO and President, solicited at least ten investors residing in Georgia,
Kentucky, and Texas to engage in retail forex transactions through a pool operated by the
Respondents. Not one penny, however, was invested in retail forex transactions by the
Respondents as they represented they would do. Most or all of the investors were friends and
acquaintances of Simmons, who were not sophisticated investors, had limited prior knowledge of
foreign currency markets, and based their investment decisions on information provided by
Simmons.

None of these investors were eligible contract participants (âECPâ) as defined in Section
1a(18)(A)(xi) of the Act, 7 U.S.C, Â§ 1a(18)(A)(xi) (2012); see also 7 U.S.C. Â§ ladi2)(A)Cxi)
(Supp. II 2009). The pool operated by the Respondents also was not an ECP as defined by

 

enforce the terms of this Order. Nor do Respondents consent to the use of the Offer or this Order, or the findings or
conclusions in this Order consented to in the Offer, by any other party in any other proceeding,

 
Section la(18)(A)(iv) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1a(18)(A)(iv) (2012); see also 7 U.S.C.
Â§ la(12)(A)Giv) (Supp. II 2009),

In their dealings with investors, Respondents made multiple material misrepresentations
and omissions of material facts, including that investorsâ funds would be used for off-exchange
foreign currency transactions, where investor funds would be traded, the trading experience of
Global Consortiums and its affiliated personnel, the risks involved, their trading track record, and
profits earned from retail forex transactions. Specifically, the Respondentsâ misrepresentations
and omissions included the following:

e Respondents told prospective investors that Global Consortiums would trade foreign
currency on behalf of investors on a financed, margined, or leveraged basis at a now-
defunct futures commission merchant (âFCMâ) and registered foreign exchange
dealer, through an account held in Global Consortiumsâ name, even though they knew
that Global Consortiums did not have an account at that firm and no funds were ever
actually traded in retail forex transactions.

e Respondents provided at least one investor a brochure claiming that Global
Consortiums used an experienced âteam of brokers, traders, and money managers that
have over 80 years of financial market experience and execution know howâ and who
were âregistered and regulatedâ by the Commission, when in fact they did not employ
or use such personnel.

e A performance chart included in the brochure used in or around March 2010 showed
that Global Consortiums had engaged in retail forex transactions on behalf of
investors at the FCM without ever losing money, and that it had achieved monthly
profits from retail forex transactions ranging from 10.15% to 13.10% between
September 2008 and December 2009, when in fact Global Consortiums was not
formed until June 2009 and had never engaged in retail forex transactions.

e Respondents provided at least three investors with monthly account statements which
falsely represented their pro rata share of purported trading profits, when in fact no
trading had taken place and no profits had been made.

During the Relevant Period, as a result of Respondentsâ solicitation efforts, at least ten
investors deposited a total of at least $435,985 into Global Consortiumsâ bank account for the
purpose of engaging in retail forex transactions. None of those funds were used for forex
transactions.

Although Respondents paid at least $218,825 back to their investors, they ceased making
such payments in October 2011 and did not repay the balance of at least $229,660 that they still
owed. Respondents misappropriated at least $217,160 for improper uses, including spending
investor funds on personal entertainment, vacations, gifts or loans to friends, and other _
unauthorized and undisclosed purposes. Simmons was the sole signatory on Global
Consortiumsâ bank account.

 
Global Consortiums acted as a CPO by soliciting and accepting funds from investors for
participation in a pool to engage in retail forex transactions, but was never registered with the
Commission as a CPO or in any other capacity, Global Consortiums is not a United States
financial institution, registered broker dealer, insurance company, financial holding company, or
investment bank holding company, or an AP of such entities.

Simmons acted as an AP of Global Consortiums by soliciting and accepting funds from
investors for participation in the commodity pool operated by Global Consortiums, but he was
never registered with the Commission in that capacity or any other capacity. Simmons is not a
United States financial institution, registered broker dealer, insurance company, financial holding
company, investment bank holding company, or an AP of such entities.

IV.
LEGAL DISCUSSION

A, Global Consortiums and Simmons Defrauded Pool Participants

Respondentsâ fraudulent conduct violated various provisions of the Act and Commission
Regulations during the course of the Relevant Period.

Pursuant to Section 2(c)(2)(C)(iv) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(c)(2)(C)(iv) (Supp. II 2009),
Section 4b of the Act applies to retail forex transactions offered to, or entered into with, non-
ECPs on a leveraged, margined, or financed basis, âas ifâ they were contracts of sale of a

commodity for future delivery, bringing retail forex transactions within the scope of Sections
Ab(a)(2)(A)-(C) of the Act.

Sections 4b(a)(2)(A)-(C) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§6b(a)(2)(A)-(C) (Supp. II 2009 and Supp.
IV 2011), provide, in relevant part, that it is unlawful for any person, in or in connection with
any order to make or the making of a contract of sale of a commodity for future delivery, that is
made, or to be made, for or no behalf of another person, (A) to cheat or defraud or attempt to
cheat or defraud another person, or (B) willfully to make or cause to be made to the other person
any false report or statement or willfully to enter or cause to be entered for the other person any
false record, or (C) willfully to deceive or attempt to deceive another person in regard to any
order or contract.

During the Relevant Period, Respondents violated Sections 4b(a)(2)(A)-(C) of the Act, 7
USS.C. Â§Â§ @b(a)(2)(A)-(C). Respondents, in or in connection with retail forex transactions to be
made for or on behalf of their investors, cheated or defrauded, or attempted to cheat or defraud,
their investors, and willfully deceived or attempted to deceive investors, by fraudulently
soliciting investor funds for the purpose of engaging in retail forex transactions, by
misrepresenting that investorsâ funds would be used for retail forex transactions, where the
investors funds would be traded, the trading experience and registration status of Global
Consortiums personnel, the risks involved, Respondentsâ trading track record, and profits earned
from retail forex transactions. Respondents issued monthly statements to at least three investors
which falsely represented investorsâ pro-rata share of monthly profit from engaging in retail

 
forex transactions, when no such results were achieved. Respondents also misappropriated
investor funds for their own purposes.

For conduct on or after October 18, 2010, Regulations 5.2(b)(1)-(3), 17 C.F.R.
Â§ 5.2(b)(1)-(3), also prohibit fraud in or in connection with retail forex transactions.
Specifically, Regulations 5.2(b)(1)-(3) make it unlawful for any person, in or in connection with
any retail forex transaction, (1) to cheat or defraud or attempt to cheat or defraud any person, (2)
willfully to make or cause to be made to the other person any false report or statement or
willfully to enter or cause to be entered for the other person any false record, or (3) willfully to
deceive or attempt to deceive any person by any means whatsoever.

As of October 18, 2010 and continuing through the end of the Relevant Period,
Respondents violated Regulations 5.2(b)(1)-(3), 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 5.2(b)(1)-(3). Through use of the
mails or other means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce, in or in connection with retail
forex transactions, Respondents cheated or defrauded or attempted to cheat or defraud investors,
and willfully deceived or attempted to deceive investors, by fraudulently soliciting investor funds
and willfully making or causing to be made false monthly account statements.

Sections 40(1)(A) and (B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 60(1)(A) and (B) (2006), make it
unlawful for a CPO or an AP of a CPO to use the mails or any means or instrumentality of
interstate commerce, directly or indirectly, to employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud
any pool participant or prospective pool participant, or to engage in any transaction, practice, or
course of business that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any pool participant or prospective pool
participant. Unlike Section 4b(a)(2) and 40(1)(A) of the Act, the language of Section 40(1)(B)
does not require âknowingâ or âwillfulâ conduct as a prerequisite for liability. Commodity Trend
Service, Inc, vy. CFTC, 233 F.3d 981, 993 (7th Cir. 2000). The same conduct that constitutes
violations of Section 4b(a)(2) of the Act, as described above, also constitutes violations of
Sections 40(1)(A) and (B) of the Act. See, e.g, CFTC vy. Skorupskas, 605 F. Supp. 923, 932-33
(E.D, Mich. 1985),

As of July 16, 2011, the statutory definition of CPO included a business that is in the
nature of an investment trust, syndicate, or similar form of enterprise that solicited, accepted, or
received funds, securities, or other property from others for the purpose of trading in retail forex

transactions. 7 U.S.C, Â§ la(l1)(A)GdD.

As of July 16, 2011 and continuing through the end of the Relevant Period, Global
Consortiums operated as a CPO, in that it engaged in a business that is in the nature of an
investment trust, syndicate, or similar form of enterprise and, in connection therewith, solicited,
accepted, or received funds from others for the purpose of engaging in retail forex transactions,
Using the mails or means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce, Respondents directly or
indirectly employed a device, scheme, or artifice to defraud their investors and engaged in

 

* See Regulation of Off-Exchange Retail Foreign Exchange Transactions and Intermediaries, 75 Fed. Reg. 55410
(Sept. 10, 2010) (issuing final rules regulating retail forex transactions, which became effective as of October 18,
2010). As defined in Regulation 5.1(m), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 5.1(m), retail forex transactions include any account,
agreement, contract, or transaction described in Section 2(c)(2)(C) of the Act.

 
transactions, practices, or a course of business which operated as a fraud or deceit upon such
investors, in violation of Sections FDA) and (B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 60(1)(A) and (B)
(Supp. IV 2011).

B. Global Consortiums Acted as an Unregistered CPO

Pursuant to Section 4m(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6m(1) (Supp. IV 2011), it is unlawful
for any CPO, unless registered, to make use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of
interstate commerce in connection with its business as a CPO. From July 16, 2011 through the
end of the Relevant Period, Global Consortiums acted as a CPO within this statutory definition
by soliciting and accepting funds from investors to be pooled for the purpose of engaging in
retail forex transactions, and it made use of the mails or other means or instrumentality of
interstate commerce in connection with this business, without registering as a CPO, in violation
of Section 4m(1) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6m(1) (Supp. IV 2011).

C, Simmons Acted as an Unregistered AP

Section 4k(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6k(2) (Supp. IV 2011), prohibits a person from being
associated with a CPO as a partner, officer, employee, consultant, or agent (or any person
occupying a similar status or performing similar functions) in any capacity that involves (i) the
solicitation of funds, securities, or property for participation in a commodity pool, or (ii) the
supervision of any person or persons so engaged, unless such person is registered with the
Commission as an AP of such CPO. Section 4k(2) further prohibits a CPO from permitting such
a person to become or remain associated with the CPO if the CPO knew or should have known
that the person was not registered. Regulation 3.12(a), 17 C.F.R. Â§ 3.12(a) (2012), prohibits a
person from being associated with a CPO unless the person is registered as an AP of the CPO.

From July 16, 2011 through the end of the Relevant Period, Simmons solicited funds for
participation in the Global Consortiums pool. Because Simmons was not registered as an AP of
Global Consortiums, he violated Section 4k(2) of the Act and Regulation 3.12(a). In addition,
Global Consortiums permitted Simmons to become or remain associated with it knowing that he
was not registered as an AP, also in violation of Section 4k(2) of the Act.

D. Global Consortiums and Simmons Are Each Liable for the Otherâs Violations

Section 13(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13c(b) (2012), imposes liability on a person who,
directly or indirectly, controls any person who has violated the Act or any rules, regulations, or
orders issued pursuant to the Act, if that controlling person did not act in good faith or knowingly
induced, directly or indirectly, the act or acts constituting the violation. Simmons was the Chief
Executive Officer, President, and sole owner of Global Consoritums, was the sole signatory on
Global Consortiumsâ bank account, and was responsible for its operations, Therefore, Simmons
controlled Global Consortiums. Since Simmons committed and knowingly induced, directly or
indirectly, the violations of the Act and Regulations by Global Consortiums, and did not act in
good faith, he is liable for those violations of the Act and Regulations pursuant to Section 13(b)
of the Act.

 
Moreover, Simmonsâ violations occurred within the course and scope of his employment
or office at Global Consortiums. Therefore Global Consortiums is also liable, pursuant to
Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(a)(1)(B), and Regulation 1,2, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.2, for
Simmonsâ violations of the Act and Regulations.

ORDER

Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT:

A.

Respondents shall cease and desist from violating Sections 4b(a)(2)(A)-(C),
4k(2), 4m(1), and 40(1)(A) and (B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 6b(a)(2)(A)-(C),
6k(2), 6m(1), and 60(1)(A) and (B), and Regulations 3.12(a), and 5.2(b)(1)-(3), 17
C.F.R. Â§Â§ 3.12(a), and 5.2(b)(1)-(3).

Respondents shall pay jointly and severally restitution in the amount of two-
hundred twenty-nine thousand six-hundred sixty dollars ($229,660) within thirty
(30) days of the date of entry of this Order (âRestitution Obligationâ). Ifthe
Restitution Obligation is not paid in full within thirty (30) days of the date of
entry of this Order, post-judgment interest shall accrue on the Restitution
Obligation beginning on the date of entry of this Order and shall be determined by
using the Treasury Bill rate prevailing on the date of entry of this Order pursuant
to 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1961 (2012).

To effect payment by Respondents and the distribution of restitution to
Respondentsâ investors, the Commission appoints the NFA as âMonitor.â The
Monitor shall collect payments of the Restitution Obligation from Respondents
and make distributions as set forth below. Because the Monitor is not being
specially compensated for these services, and these services are outside the
normal duties of the Monitor, it shall not be liable for any action or inaction
arising from its appointment as Monitor other than actions involving fraud.

Respondents shall make their payments of the Restitution Obligation under the
Order in the name of the âGlobal Consortiums Settlement Fundâ and shall send
such payments by electronic funds transfer, or U.S. postal money order, certified
check, bank cashierâs check, or bank money order to the Office of Administration,
National Futures Association, 300 South Riverside Plaza, Suite 1800, Chicago,
Ilinois 60606, under a cover letter that identifies the paying Respondent and the
name and docket number of this proceeding. The paying Respondent shall

9

 
simultaneously transmit copies of the cover letter and the form of payment to the
Chief Financial Officer, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Three
Lafayette Centre, 1155 21st Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20581.

The Monitor shall oversee Respondentsâ Restitution Obligation and shall have the
discretion to determine the manner of distribution of funds in an equitable fashion
to the Respondentsâ investors or may defer distribution until such time as the
Monitor may deem appropriate. In the event that the amount of payments of the
Restitution Obligation to the Monitor are of a de minimis nature such that the
Monitor determines that the administrative cost of making a restitution
distribution is impractical, the Monitor may, in its discretion, treat such restitution
payments as civil monetary penalty payments, which the Monitor shall forward to
the Commission, as discussed below. To the extent any funds accrue to the U.S.
Treasury for satisfaction of Respondentsâ Restitution Obligation, such funds shall
be transferred to the Monitor for disbursement in accordance with the procedures
set forth in the Order.

Respondents shall pay jointly and severally a civil monetary penalty in the
amount of three-hundred sixty thousand dollars ($360,000) within thirty (30) days
of the date of entry of this Order (the âCMP Obligationâ). If the CMP obligation
is not paid in full within thirty (30) days of the date of entry of this Order, post-
judgment interest shall accrue on the CMP Obligation beginning on the date of
entry of this Order and shall be determined by using the Treasury Bill rate
prevailing on the date of entry of this Order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1961 (2012).
Respondents shall pay the CMP Obligation by electronic funds transfer, U.S.
postal money order, certified check, bank cashierâs check, or bank money order.
If payment is to be made other than by electronic funds transfer, then the payment
shall be made payable to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and sent to

CFTC Orders Georgia Resident Michael E. Simmons and His Company Global Consortiums,
LLC to Pay Restitution and a Civil Monetary Penalty Totaling More than $589,000 for
Engaging in Foreign Exchange Commodity Pool Fraud

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today entered an Order requiring
Respondents Michael E. Simmons and Global Consortiums, LLC, both of Fayetteville, Georgia, jointly to pay a
$360,000 civil monetary penalty and restitution totaling $229,660 for committing fraud and misappropriation in
connection with operating a commodity pool that offered leveraged or margined off-exchange foreign currency (forex)
transactions. Simmons was the sole owner, president, and chief executive officer of Global Consortiums. Neither
Respondent has ever been registered with the CFTC.

The CFTC Order requires Simmons and Global Consortiums to cease and desist from further violations of the Commodity
Exchange Act and CFTC regulations, as charged, and permanently bans them from registering, trading, and engaging in
other CFTC-regulated activities.

According to the Order, from at least March 2010 through July 2012, Respondents fraudulently solicited and accepted at
least $435,985 from at least 10 individuals to participate in a commodity pool to trade forex, but never traded the
investorsâ funds. Respondents created and distributed account statements to investors that falsely claimed that the
commodity pool had traded forex profitably. The Order further finds that instead of investing the funds, Respondents
misappropriated at least $217,160 of investorsâ funds for non-investment purposes. Although Respondents later partially
repaid some of their investors, Respondents still owe investors $229,660, according to the Order.

Additionally, the Order finds that Global Consortiums operated as a Commodity Pool Operator (CPO) without registering
as such, as required, and that Simmons acted as an unregistered Associated Person of that CPO.

The CFTC cautions victims that restitution orders may not result in the recovery of money lost because the wrongdoers
may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers and to
ensure the wrongdoers are held accountable.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Karin N. Roth, Christopher Giglio, Douglas K.
Yatter, Lenel Hickson, Jr., and Manal M. Sultan.

CFTCâs Foreign Currency (Forex) Fraud and Commodity Pool Fraud Advisories

The CFTC has issued several customer protection Fraud Advisories that provide the warning signs of fraud, including the
Foreign Currency Trading (Forex) Fraud Advisory, which states that the CFTC has witnessed a sharp rise in Forex trading
scams in recent years and helps customers identify this potential fraud.

The CFTC has also issued a Commodity Pool Fraud Advisory, which warns customers about a type of fraud that involves
individuals and firms, often unregistered, offering investments in commodity pools.

Customers can report suspicious activities or information, such as possible violations of commodity trading laws, to the

money, securities, or property (or extended credit in lieu thereof) to margin, guarantee, or
secure trades or contracts that resulted or may have resulted therefrom, without

15. Defendant Harvard International was a Delaware corporation,
incorporated on or about February 21, 2008, with a place of business in Boca Raton,
Florida. During the First Relevant Period, Harvard International claimed to be a market
maker and dealer to retail customers in precious metals, including gold, silver, platinum,
and palladium bullion, as well as gold, silver, platinum, and palladium coins. Using
telemarketers and a website it owned, www.harvardassets.com, Harvard International

16. | Defendant Harvard Assets was a Delaware limited liability company,
formed on or about April 18, 2012, with a place of business in Boca Raton, Florida, and
with the same address as Harvard International but a different suite number. During the
Second Relevant Period, Harvard Assets claimed to be a market maker and dealer to
retail customers in precious metals, including gold, silver, platinum, and palladium
bullion, as well as gold, silver, platinum, and palladium coins. Using telemarketers and
the website www.harvardassets.com, Harvard Assets solicited retail customers to invest
in leveraged, margined, or financed precious metals transactions. Harvard Assetsâ status

17. Defendant London Assets, an affiliate of Harvard Assets, was a Delaware
corporation, incorporated on or about August 27, 2012, with a place of business in Boca
Raton, Florida, and with the same address as Harvard International. During the Second
Relevant Period, Harvard Assets and London Assets had at least one common officer,

Case 0:15-cv-62049-XXXX Document1 Entered on FLSD Docket 09/28/2015 Page 6 of 27

January 26, 2014. London Assets has never been registered with the Commission in any

President, and Treasurer of London Assets. For most of the period from January 1998
through May 2008, Marshall was registered with the Commission as an associated person
or principal of one or more Commission registrant firms. Marshall is not currently
registered with the Commission in any capacity.

19, Onor about June 30, 1999, the National Futures Association (âNFAâ)
Business Conduct Committee issued a complaint alleging that Marshall and others made
deceptive and misleading sales solicitations. On or about July 5, 2000, an NFA Hearing
Panel issued a decision ordering Marshall to pay a $5,000 fine, tape record his
conversations with customers for six months, maintain a log of his solicitations, retain the
tapes for two years, and promptly produce the same to the NFA or the CFTC upon
request.

20. On or about June 28, 2007, the NFA Business Conduct Committee issued
a complaint against Marshall and others, alleging misconduct by Marshall in connection
with another firm he owned and controlled, Sterling International Commodities
(âSterlingâ). On or about July 9, 2008, an NFA Hearing Panel issued a decision finding

that Marshall:

made misleading sales solicitations that exaggerated the profit potential of
trading options; . . . minimized the risk of loss of trading options and
Case 0:15-cv-62049-XXXX Document1 Entered on FLSD Docket 09/28/2015 Page 7 of 27

spreads; misrepresented the performance of Sterlingâs . . . customers;

misrepresented that Sterlingâs commissions were normal and customary

when, in fact, they were excessive . . . and failed to disclose that the vast

majority of Sterlingâs . . . customers lost money in the years immediately

prior to the solicitations.

21. The panel further found that Marshall used âhigh-pressure sales tactics,
failing to uphold high standards of commercial honor and just and equitable principles of
trade, and fail[ed] to supervise Sterlingâs sales force.â

22. | The panel barred Marshall from NFA membership or associated
membership and from acting as a principal of an NFA member for three years. Among
other things, the panel ordered Marshall to pay a $50,000 fine if, after the expiration of
the three-year membership bar, he were granted NFA membership or associated
membership or became a principal of an NFA Member. The panel also ordered Marshall
to tape record, for a period of one year, all conversations between him and existing and
potential customers and retain the tapes for a period of one year from the time they were
created if he again became an NFA member or associate. Finally, the panel ordered that
in the event Marshall became a principal of an NFA Member, Marshall would be
required to cause all associated persons of that firm, and of any firm of which he became
a principal, to tape record, for one year, all conversations that occurred between the
associated persons and existing or potential customers and to retain these tapes for a

period of one year from their creation.

United States for the purpose of soliciting, or accepting orders for, or otherwise dealing in
any transactions in, or in connection with, the purchase or sale of precious metals to or

this action.

A. Harvard International

34. During the First Relevant Period, Harvard International had a place of

business in Boca Raton, Florida.

11
Case 0:15-cv-62049-XXXX Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 09/28/2015 Page 12 of 27

35. Harvard International and its officers, employees, or agents, including
Marshall, solicited customers by telephone or through Harvard Internationalâs website,
www.harvardassets.com, to engage in financed precious metals transactions.

36. In these financed precious metals transactions, Harvard Internationalâs
customers invested only a percentage of the total metal value and would purportedly
receive a loan from Harvard International for the remainder of the metalâs value.
According to Harvard Internationalâs standard Account Agreement (âHarvard
International Agreementâ), Harvard Internationalâs customers incurred a finance charge
on their loans (up to 7 percent above the prime rate), as well as service/storage charges on
these transactions. Harvard Internationalâs customers also paid a commission, typically
15 percent, on the total metal value per transaction.

37. | The Harvard International Agreement provides, in part:

The formation of this Agreement constitutes the making of a contract in Palm

Beach County, Florida, notwithstanding the manner, timing or location of the

delivery or receipt of the acceptance of this Agreement by either party hereto.

The making of this contract will cause the following events, among others, to

occur in Palm Beach County, Florida: the negotiation of this contract will have

taken place and have been completed in Palm Beach County, Florida; the contract
will be executed in Palm Beach County, Florida; Harvard is located in Palm

Beach County, Florida; all deposits and payments made by Customer will be

delivered to and paid in Palm Beach County, Florida; all loans made by Harvard

will be made from and paid in Palm Beach County, Florida; and all statements of

Case 0:15-cv-62049-XXXX Document1 Entered on FLSD Docket 09/28/2015 Page 13 of 27

of metals. Harvard International solicited and accepted over $1.5 million from those
customers with respect to these transactions. After Harvard International solicited retail
customers and accepted customer orders and funds for these transactions, Harvard
International extracted:commissions and fees from these funds, and then forwarded the
orders and funds to Worth. Worth failed to make actual delivery of metals to Harvard
International customers in connection with at least 241 financed precious metals
transactions.

40. During the First Relevant Period, Worth maintained a âmasterâ account
and customer sub-accounts at depositories with whom Worth contracted to hold metal.
Worth purported to deliver metal to retail customers by âallocatingâ metal from a master
account to customer sub-accounts. However, these purported âallocationsâ did not result
in the transfer of possession or control of metal to Harvard Internationalâs customers or
agents of the customers. Accordingly, there was no actual delivery of metals to Harvard
Internationalâs customers in connection with at least 241 financed precious metals
transactions.

41. Harvard Internationalâs commissions from these at least 241 financed
precious metals transactions introduced to Worth that did not result in actual delivery of
precious metals to Harvard Internationalâs customers totaled at least approximately
$540,000.

42. Furthermore, at least 29 of these financed precious metals transactions did
not result in âallocationsâ within 28 days after the transaction, and thus did not result in
timely actual delivery of metals to Harvard Internationalâs customers for this additional

reason.

4(a) of the Act.

71. In addition to his own violations of Section 4(a) of the Act, Marshall
directly or indirectly controlled Harvard International and did not act in good faith or

knowingly induced, directly or indirectly, the acts constituting Harvard Internationalâs

Case 0:15-cv-62049-XXXX Documenti1 Entered on FLSD Docket 09/28/2015 Page 19 of 27

violations of Section 4(a) of the Act alleged in this Complaint. Therefore, pursuant to
Section 13(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 13(b) (2012), Marshall is liable for each of Harvard
Internationalâs violations of Section 4(a) of the Act.

72. The acts, failures, and omissions of Harvard Internationalâs officers,
employees, and/or agents, including Marshall, as described in this Complaint, were done
within the scope of the individualsâ employment or office with Harvard International, and
are deemed to be the acts, failures, and omissions of Harvard International by operation
of Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C Â§ 2(a)(1)(B) (2012), and Regulation 1.2, 17
C.F.R. Â§ 1.2 (2014). Harvard International is therefore liable as principal for each of the
acts, omissions, or failures by its employees and/or agents, including Marshall, that
constitute violations of Section 4(a) of the Act.

CFTC Charges Florida Resident Todd Owen Marshall and His Companies Harvard Assets
LLC, London Assets Inc., and Harvard International Trading, Inc. with Engaging in Illegal,
Off-Exchange Precious Metals Transactions and Registration Violations

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced the filing of a civil
injunctive enforcement action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida against Defendants Harvard
Assets LLC (Harvard Assets), London Assets Inc. (London Assets), and Harvard International Trading, Inc.
(Harvard International) (collectively, the Entity Defendants), all three operating in Florida, and their controlling person,
Defendant Todd Owen Marshall with a last known address in Deerfield Beach, Florida (collectively, Defendants).

The CFTC Complaint charges the Defendants with engaging in illegal, off-exchange transactions in precious metals with
retail customers on a leveraged, margined, or financed basis, and charges the Entity Defendants with acting as Futures
Commission Merchants (FCMs) without registering as such with the CFTC, as required.

According to the Complaint, from on or around July 16, 2011 to April 30, 2012 or later, Harvard International and Marshall
solicited at least 42 retail customers to engage in at least 241 financed precious metals transactions and accepted over
$1.5 million from those customers with respect to these transactions. The Complaint further alleges that from on or
around September 6, 2012 or earlier to March 5, 2013 or later, Harvard Assets, London Assets, and Marshall solicited at
least $231,963 from at least 14 retail customers to engage in at least 48 leveraged, margined, or financed precious
metals transactions. In addition, the Complaint alleges that the Entity Defendants were acting as FCMs without so
registering with the CFTC as required. Marshall is further charged with liability for the violations by the Entity Defendants,
as a controlling person of the Entity Defendants who knowingly induced the violations or failed in act in good faith.

Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, off-exchange leveraged, margined, or
financed transactions such as those conducted by the Defendants are illegal unless they result in actual delivery of metal
within 28 days. The Complaint alleges that metals were never actually delivered in connection with the leveraged,
margined, or financed precious metals transactions on behalf of the Defendantsâ customers. The Complaint alleges that
Harvard International conducted its customersâ financed precious metals transactions through Worth Group Inc. (Worth)
and that Harvard Assets and London Assets conducted their customersâ financed precious metals transactions through
Hunter Wise Commodities, LLC (Hunter Wise). The CFTC previously brought enforcement actions against both Worth and
Hunter Wise in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida.

The CFTC sued Worth in August 2013 (see CFTC Press Release 6666-13), charging Worth with engaging in illegal, off-
exchange precious metals transactions and other violations. On January 23, 2014, the District Court entered a Consent
Order of Preliminary Injunction enjoining Worth from violating Sections 6(c)(1), 4(a), and 4b(a)(1)(A) and (C) of the CEA, 7
U.S.C. Â§Â§9(1), 6(a), and 6b(a)(1)(A) and (C) (2012), and CFTC Regulation 180.1, 17 C.F.R. Â§180.1 (2013).

The CFTC sued Hunter Wise and others in December 2012, charging the defendants with engaging in illegal, off-
exchange precious metals transactions and other violations (see CFTC Press Release 6447-12). On February 19, 2014,
the District Court found that Hunter Wise had no actual metal to deliver to customers and held that Hunter Wise engaged
in illegal precious metals transactions and was required to register as a Futures Commission Merchant but did not do so
and therefore violated Sections 4(a) and 4d of the CEA (see CFTC v. Hunter Wise Commodities, LLC, et al., No. 12-81311
(Order on the Partiesâ Motions for Summary Judgment)). On April 15, 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh
Circuit affirmed the courtâs issuance of a preliminary injunction and held that the CFTCâs jurisdiction under Section 2(c)(2)
(D) of the CEA extends to the precious metals transactions at issue in the case and that no exception to the CFTCâs
jurisdiction applied. And, on May 16, 2014, after a bench trial on the remaining claims, including fraud, the District Court
entered an Order finding that Hunter Wise fraudulently misrepresented the nature of precious metals transactions that
resulted in millions of dollars in customer losses (see CFTC Press Release 6935-14).

In its continuing litigation against the Defendants, the CFTC seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, restitution, civil
monetary penalties, permanent registration and trading bans, and a permanent injunction from future violations of the
Commodity Exchange Act, as charged.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this action are Christopher Giglio, David C. Newman, R.
Stephen Painter, Jr., Xavier Romeu-Matta, Steven Ringer, Lenel Hickson, Jr., and Manal M. Sultan.

Respondent.

 

ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTIONS 6(c) AND 6(d) OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, MAKING
FINDINGS AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

I.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ) has reason to believe that
on June 14, 2010, June 15, 2010, December 10, 2010, April 12, 2013, April 15, 2013, and
December 11, 2013, (the âRelevant Datesâ), Daniel Bowman (âBowmanâ or âRespondentââ)
violated Section 4a(e) of the Commodity Exchange Act (the âActââ), 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6a(e) (2012).
Therefore, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest that public
administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted to determine whether Respondent
engaged in the violations set forth herein and to determine whether any order should be issued
imposing remedial sanctions.

IT.

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, Respondent has
submitted an Offer of Settlement (âOfferââ), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Without admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, Respondent consents to
the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 6(c) and 6(d) of the
Commodity Exchange Act, Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (âOrderâ) and
acknowledges service of this Order,'

 

' Respondent consents to the entry of this Order and to the use of these findings in this

proceeding and in any other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission
is a party; provided, however, that Respondent does not consent to the use of the Offer, or the

 
TI.
The Commission finds the following:
A, SUMMARY

On three trading days in 2010, and three trading days in 2013, Respondent exceeded the
spot month speculative position limit for the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. (âCMEâ) Live
Cattle futures contract. In 2013 Respondent controlled the trading of a company named Four
Aces Investment Group, LLC (âFour Acesâ), On the trading days of the position limit violations
in 2013, the aggregate futures position held by Four Aces and Respondent exceeded the spot
month speculative position limit in the Live Cattle futures contract.

B. RESPONDENT

Respondent Daniel Lee Bowman (âBowmanâ) resides in Lisle, Illinois, and was
registered with the Commission as a Floor Broker from January 1, 1982 until June 10, 2014.
Bowman was the Agent and Manager of Four Aces, an IIlinois limited liability company. In
2012, Bowman reported that he controlled the trading of Four Aces on his Commission Form 40
âStatement of Reporting Trader.â Bowman retired as a floor broker in June of 2014.

C, FACTS

The trading of the Live Cattle futures and options on futures contracts is subject to
speculative position limits established by the CME and approved by the Commission. During
the Relevant Dates, the Live Cattle futures position limit in the spot month was 450 contracts as
of the close of business on the first business day following the first Friday of the contract month
until the close of business on the business day preceding the last five business days of the
contract month. Any person desiring to own or control a position in excess of the speculative
position limits was required to obtain an exemption from the CME. Respondent did not obtain
an exemption that would permit the accounts for which he traded to hold Live Cattle futures
positions in excess of the CMEâs limits.

In 2010, Respondent exceeded the CME Live Cattle futures contract speculative position
limit on three days. Respondentâs long positions in the June 2010 Live Cattle futures contract
were as follows: 546 contracts on June 14, 2010, which exceeded the position limit by 96
contracts; and 506 contracts on June 15, 2010, which exceeded the position limit by 56 contracts.
Respondentâs long position in the December 2010 Live Cattle futures contract was 483 contracts
on December 10, 2010, which exceeded the position limit by 33 contracts.

 

findings or conclusions in this Order consented to in the Offer, as the sole basis for any other
proceeding brought by the Commission, other than in a proceeding in bankruptcy or to enforce
the terms of this Order. Nor does Respondent consent to the use of the Offer or this Order, or the
findings or conclusions in this Order consented to in the Offer, by any other party in any other
proceeding.

 
In 2013, the aggregate net futures position of Four Aces and Respondent exceeded the
CME Live Cattle futures contract speculative position limit on three days, The aggregate net
short futures positions held by Four Aces and Respondent in the April 2013 Live Cattle futures
contract were as follows: 512 contracts on April 12, 2013 and April 15, 2013, which exceeded
the position limit by 62 contracts, and 462 contracts later in the day on April 15, 2013, which
exceeded the position limit by 12 contracts. The aggregate net long futures position held by Four
Aces and Respondent in the December 2013 Live Cattle futures contract was 463 contracts on
December 11, 2013, which exceeded the position limit by 13 contracts. Bowmanâs ill-gotten
gross profits from trades that exceeded the position limits were $ 34,940.01.

IV.
LEGAL DISCUSSION

Section 4a(e) of the Act, in relevant part, makes it unlawful for any person âto violate any
bylaw, rule, regulation, or resolution of any contract market, derivatives transaction execution
facility, or other board of trade licensed, designated, or registered by the Commission ... fixing
limits on the amount of trading which may be done or positions which may be held by any
person under contracts of sale of any commodity for future delivery or under options on such
contracts or commodities, if such bylaw, rule, regulation, or resolution has been approved by the
Commission.â 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6a(e) (2012).

CME is a registered entity as defined by 1a(40) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1a(40) (2012), and
a designated contract market for the Live Cattle futures contract pursuant to Section 5 of the Act,
7 U.S.C, Â§ 7 (2012). The Commission approved the CMEâs speculative position limit for the
Live Cattle futures contract in February 2003.

CME rules set a speculative position limit in the Live Cattle futures contract of 450
contracts long or short in the expiring contract month as of the close of business on the first
business day following the first Friday of the contract month until the close of business on the
business day preceding the last five business days of the contract month. CME Rule 10102.E.

Commission Regulation 150,5(g) provides, in relevant part, that, â[i]n determining
whether any person has exceeded the limits established under this section, all positions in
accounts for which such person by power of attorney or otherwise directly or indirectly controls
trading shall be included with the positions held by such person.â 17 C.F.R. Â§ 150.5(g) (2015),
The CMEâs aggregation rule similarly provides that the position limits apply to âall positions in
accounts for which a person by power of attorney or otherwise directly or indirectly owns the
positions or controls the trading of the positionsâ in determining whether that person has exceed
the position limits. CME Rule 559.D.

Respondent controlled the trading of the Live Cattle futures contract for Four Aces on the
dates of the position limit violations in 2013. Pursuant to CME Rule 559.D, the positions held
by Four Aces were required to be aggregated with Respondentâs positions for purposes of
applying CMEâs speculative position limits for the Live Cattle futures contract.

 
By exceeding the CME position limit for the Live Cattle futures contract on three trading
days in 2010, and on an aggregated basis on three trading days in 2013, Respondent violated
Section 4a(e) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 6a(e) (2012). The plain language of Section 4a(e) of the Act
unambiguously imposes liability for violations of designated contract market position limit rules
such as those at issue here. Saberi v. CFTC, 488 F.3d 1207, 1212 (9th Cir. 2007) (rejecting a
traderâs contention that the Commission was required to prove that he intended to violate the
speculative limits in frozen pork bellies futures set forth in CME Rule 8302.E (citing CFIC y.
Hunt, 591 F.2d 1211, 1218 (7th Cir. 1979)). Exceeding position limit rules is sufficient to
constitute a violation of Section 4a(e) of the Act; the Commission does not need to establish
scienter, or intent to violate position limits, in order to prove a violation. Saberi, 488 F.3d at
1212 n. 4; Ant, 591 F.2d at 1218.

CFTC Order Imposes a Monetary Penalty and Permanent Trading and Registration Bans
against Daniel Bowman for Violating Speculative Position Limits in Live Cattle Futures

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today issued an Order filing and
simultaneously settling charges against Daniel Bowman of Lisle, Illinois, for exceeding the spot month speculative
position limit for the Live Cattle futures contract traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).

The Order finds that on three trading days in 2010, and three trading days in 2013, Bowman exceeded the spot month
speculative position limit for the CME Live Cattle futures contract. The spot month speculative position limit was
established by the CME and approved by the CFTC. In 2013, Bowman controlled the Live Cattle futures trading of Four
Aces Investment Group, LLC (Four Aces). On the trading days of the position limit violations in 2013, the aggregate
futures position held by Four Aces and Bowman exceeded the spot month speculative position limit in the Live Cattle
futures contract, the Order finds.

In addition to imposing a $34,940.01 civil monetary penalty, the Order requires Bowman to cease and desist from further
violations of Section 4a(e) of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC Regulation 150.5. The Order further imposes
permanent trading and registration bans on Bowman. Finally, Bowman must also comply with the conditions,
undertakings, and representations set forth in the Order.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this action are George Malas, Patrick Marquardt, Melanie
Devoe, Peter M. Haas, and Paul G. Hayeck.

Proceedings Clerk

 

 

American Portfolio Asset
Management, Inc. and Alan M.
Kneller,

CFTC Docket No. 15 - 38 12:27 pm, Sep 29, 2015

 

Respondents,

ORDER INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO SECTIONS 6(c) AND 6(d) OF
THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT, MAKING FINDINGS
AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS

I,

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (âCommissionâ) has reason to believe that
American Portfolio Asset Management, Inc. ââAPAMâ) and its sole owner, president and chief
executive officer, Alan M. Kneller (âKnellerâ) (the âRespondentsâ) violated Sections 4(a) and
4d(a)(1) of the Commodity Exchange Act, (the âActââ), 7 U.S.C. Â§8 6(a) and 6d(a)(1) (2012).
Therefore, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest that public
administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted to determine whether the Respondents
engaged in the violations set forth herein and to determine whether any order should be issued
imposing remedial sanctions.

Ik,

In anticipation of the institution of an administrative proceeding, the Respondents have
submitted an Offer of Settlement (âOfferâ), which the Commission has determined to accept.
Without admitting or denying any of the findings or conclusions herein, the Respondents consent
to the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 6(c) and 6(d) of the
Commodity Exchange Act, Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (âOrderââ) and
acknowledge service of this Order.'

 

' The Respondents consent to the entry of this Order and to the use of these findings in this proceeding and in any
other proceeding brought by the Commission or to which the Commission is a party; provided, however, that the
Respondents do not consent to the use of the Offer, or the findings or conclusions in the Order consented to in the
Offer, as the sole basis for any other proceeding brought by the Commission, other than in a proceeding in
bankruptcy or to enforce the terms of this Order. Nor do the Respondents consent to the use of the Offer or the
Order, or the findings or conclusions in this Order consented to in the Offer, by any other party in any other

proceeding,

 
III.

The Commission finds the following:

A. Summary

From at least August 2011 and continuing through at least February 2013 (the âRelevant
Periodâ), the Respondents violated Sections 4(a) and 4d(a)(1) of the Act by offering to enter into,
entering into, confirming the execution of, and conducting an office or business for the purpose
of soliciting, accepting orders for, and otherwise dealing in illegal, off-exchange retail
commodity transactions, and by accepting money, securities or property (or extending credit) to
margin, guarantee, or secure any resulting rates or contract without being registered with the
Commission as a futures commission merchant. Specifically, the transactions were financed
precious metals transactions involving gold and silver with individual investors most or all of
whom were not eligible contract participants or eligible commercial entities. Kneller is directly
liable for such violations, and is also liable as the controlling person of APAM. APAM received
commissions and fees totaling $478,474 for these transactions,

B. Respondents

American Portfolio Asset Management Inc. is a corporation located in Boca Raton,
Florida. APAM solicited retail customers to execute commodity transactions with Worth Metals
(âWorthâ) and AmeriFirst Management LLC (âAmeriFirstâ), by telephone and through a
website, www.apamanagement.com. APAM ceased doing this business in or around February
2013. APAM has never registered with the Commission in any capacity.

Alan M. Kneller is the incorporator and sole owner of APAM. Kneller is a resident of
Boca Raton, Florida. At all relevant times herein, Kneller was the controlling person of APAM.
Kneller is the owner, president and chief executive officer of APAM. Kneller managed the day
to day operations, supervising APAM employees and telemarketersâ solicitation of retail
customers and engaging in the solicitations himself. Kneller was the sole signatory on APAMâs
bank accounts. Kneller has never been registered with the Commission in any capacity.

OF Other Relevant Entities

 

AmeriFirst Management, LLC is a Florida limited liability company formed in October
2011. It has never been registered with the Commission in any capacity. On its website, it
claimed to provide dealers with âtangible assets in a growing physical marketâ and ââguarantee[s]|
that every ounce of metal in [the dealerâs] customers [sic] account exists and is ready for delivery
at any point in time.â During the Relevant Period, AmeriFirst executed and confirmed the
execution of retail commodity transactions involving gold, silver, and platinum throughout the
United States using a network of telemarketing solicitors, such as APAM, that it referred to as
âdealers,â

Worth Group Ince. is a Florida corporation formed in June 2002 that has previously gone
by the names of Wilshire Capital Management Corp. and Worth Bullion Group Inc. It has never

 
been registered with the Commission in any capacity. Worth describes itself as âa Florida-based
precious metals wholesaler [that] might also be described as a dealer or broker of precious
metals.â During the Relevant Period, Worth executed and confirmed the execution of retail
commodity transactions involving gold, silver, and platinum throughout the United States using a
network of telemarketing solicitors, such as APAM, that it referred to as âdealers.â

D. Facts

During the Relevant Period, APAM was a marketing firm that solicited retail customers
to engage in financed precious metals transactions involving gold and silver with individual
investors, most or all of whom were not eligible contract participants (âECPsââ) or eligible
commercial entities (âECEsâ). Although APAM offered precious metals on a fully paid basis,
the vast majority of its business was in financed precious metals transactions, This Order relates
to the financed precious metals transactions executed through AmeriFirst and Worth.

APAM conducted nearly all of its solicitations by telephone or through its website.
Kneller, the controlling person of APAM, directly solicited customers and supervised the other
telemarketers involved in solicitation. When soliciting customers for the financed precious
metals transactions executed through AmeriFirst and Worth, Kneller and the other APAM _
telemarketers represented that to purchase a certain quantity of metal, the customer needed to
deposit at least 20% of the total metal value and that the customer would receive a loan for the
remaining value. The customer would have to pay interest on the loan (approximately 4.5%
above the âprime rateââ), as well as a service charge. In addition, in order to purchase the metal,
APAM represented that the customer needed to pay commission of up to 15% of the total metal
value, and a mark-up of 4% on the spot price of the metal.

If the customer agreed to the transaction, APAM confirmed the transaction and directed
the customer to send APAM the necessary funds to margin, guarantee or secure the precious
metals transaction. For those financed precious metals transactions executed and confirmed by
AmeriFirst, APAM sent the entire amount received from the customer to AmeriFirst who then
sent APAM any commission and fees due. For the transactions executed and confirmed by
Worth, APAM deducted any commissions and fees earned from the amount received from the
customer before sending the funds, During the Relevant Period, APAM received $478,474 in
commissions and fees from these transactions executed through AmeriFirst and Worth.

Neither APAM nor Worth or AmeriFirst physically delivered the entire quantity of silver
or gold purchased by any of its customers (including any portion purchased using leverage,
margin, or financing) into their possession, or deposited the metals purchased into a depository
other than the sellers, or transferred title to the customer for that quantity of metal.â

 

? See Retail Commodity Transactions Under Commodity Exchange Act, 78 Fed. Reg. 52,426, 52,428 (Aug. 23,
2013). The district court found in the Commissionâs action against AmeriFirst that it failed to deliver metals to any
of its dealersâ retail customers. See CFTC vy. AmeriFirst Management, LLC, et al., No. 13-cv-61637 (S.D. Fla.)
(consent order of permanent injunction entered on Sept. 17, 2013).

 
IV.
LEGAL DISCUSSION
A. Relevant Statutory Background

Title VI of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010,
Public Law 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376 (2010) (the âDodd-Frank Actââ) amended the Commodity
Exchange Act to add, among other things, new authority over certain leveraged, margined, or
financed retail commodity transactions, including authority to prohibit fraud in connection with
such transactions. â

Section 742(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act added Section 2(c)(2)(D) to the Act, 7 U.S.C.
Â§ 2(c)(2)(D) (2012).? Section 2(c)(2)(D) broadly applies to any agreement, contract, or
transaction in any commodity that is entered into with, or offered to (even if not entered into
with), a non-ECPâ or a non-eligible commercial entity on a leveraged or margined basis, or
financed by the offeror, the counterparty, or a person acting in concert with the offeror or
counterparty on a similar basis. 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(c)(2)(D)(i). Section 2(c)(2)(D) further provides, in
relevant part, that such an agreement, contract, or transaction shall be subject to Sections 4(a),
4(b), and 4b of the Act âas if the agreement, contract, or transaction was a contract of sale of a
commodity for future delivery.â 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(c)(2)(D)Qii1).

Section 2(c)(2)(D)(i1) of the Act excepts certain transactions from Section 2(c)(2)(D).
Section 2(c)(2)(D)Gi)(1I1)(aa) excepts a contract of sale that âresults in actual delivery within 28
days or such other longer period as the Commission may determine by rule or regulation based
upon the typical commercial practice in cash or spot markets for the commodity involved.â
Section 2(c)(2)(D)Gi)(II1)(bb) excepts a contract of sale that creates an enforceable obligation to
deliver between a seller and a buyer that have the ability to deliver and accept delivery,
respectively, in connection with the line of business of the seller and buyer.

The Commission has stated that the determination of whether âactual deliveryâ has
occurred within the meaning of Section 2(c)(2)(D)(ii) (1D (aa) requires a consideration of
evidence beyond the four corners of the contract documents. This interpretation of the statutory
language is based on Congressâs use of the word âactualâ to modify âdeliveryâ and on the
legislative history of Section 2(c)(2)(D)(ii)CID(aa). Consistent with this interpretation, in
determining whether actual delivery has occurred within 28 days, the Commission will employ a

 

* Section 2(c)(2)(D) of the Act became effective July 16, 2011.

* As is relevant to this matter, Section 1a(18)(xi) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1a(18)(xi) (2012), defines an eligible
contract participant as an individual who has amounts invested on a discretionary basis, the aggregate of which is in
excess of $10,000,000, or which is in excess of $5,000,000, and who enters into the agreement, contract, or
transaction in order to manage the risk associated with an asset owned or liability incurred, or reasonably likely to be
owned or incurred, by the individual.

Â° The Commission has not adopted any regulations permitting a longer actual delivery period for any commodity
pursuant to Section 2(c)(2)(D)(i) UID) (aa). Accordingly, the 28-day actual delivery period set forth in this provision
remains applicable to all commodities.

 
functional approach and examine how the agreement contract or transaction is marketed,
managed, and performed, instead of relying solely on language used by the parties in the
agreement, contract, or transaction.Â® Unless the Commission provides otherwise, the 28 days for
actual delivery is 28 days from the date the agreement, contract, or transaction is confirmed to
the buyer or seller, typically a retail customer.

Other than these exceptions, Congress did not express any intent to limit the reach of
Section 2(c)(2)(D). Rather, in enacting the statute Congress expressed its intent that Section
2(c)(2)(D) should be applicable to a broad range of agreements, contracts, and transactions.

Section 2(c)(2)(D) of the Act applies to all agreements, contracts, and transactions
entered into with, or offered to, non-ECPs on a leveraged or margined basis, or financed by the
offeror, the counterparty, or a person acting in concert with the offeror or counterparty on a
similar basis, as those terms are commonly used in the industry.

B. The Commissionâs Jurisdiction

The Respondents offered precious metals transactions to, and entered into such
transactions with, persons who were not ECPs or ECEs. Generally, these customers were
unsophisticated, individual investors who did not meet the $10 million discretionary investment
threshold to be considered ECPs. Moreover, Respondents offered and entered into such
transactions on a margined or leveraged basis, or financed by Worth or AmeriFirst, which acted
in concert with the Respondents. The Respondentsâ retail financed precious metals transactions
fall squarely within the Commissionâs jurisdiction under Section 2(c)(2)(D) of the Act.

The Respondentsâ retail financed precious metals transactions executed through Worth
_and AmeriFirst did not result in actual delivery to the customer, As found by the district court in
CFTC y, AmeriFirst Management, LLC, et al., No. 0:13-cv-61637-WPD (S.D. Fla. Sept. 17,
2013), slip op. at 6, AmeriFirst never sold, possessed, owned, or held title to any precious metals
in connection with these leveraged, margined, or financed transactions. The Respondentsâ
transactions are not exempted from the Commissionâs jurisdiction under Section
2(c(2)(D) Gi) of the Act.

Cc, Respondents Violated Section 4(a) of the Act

As stated above, retail commodity transactions within the scope of Section 2(c)(2)(D) of
the Act are subject to enforcement under Section 4(a) of the Act, among other provisions, as if
such transactions are commodity futures contracts. Section 4(a) of the Act makes it illegal for
any person to offer to enter into, enter into, execute, confirm the execution of, or conduct an
office or business in the United States for the purpose of soliciting, or accepting any order for, or
otherwise dealing in any transactions in, or in connection with, a commodity futures contract,
unless such transaction is made on or subject to the rules of a board of trade that has been
designated or registered by the CFTC as a contract market or derivatives transaction execution
facility for the specific commodity.

 

Â° See Retail Commodity Transactions Under Commodity Exchange Act, 78 Fed. Reg. 52,426 (Aug. 23, 2013).

 
The Respondents offered to enter into, entered into, and confirmed the execution of retail
financed precious metals transactions executed through AmeriFirst and Worth. The Respondents
also conducted an office or business in the United States for the purpose of soliciting, accepting
orders for, and otherwise dealing in retail financed precious metal transactions. None of the
retail financed precious metals transactions were conducted on or subject to the rules of a board
of trade that has been designated or registered by the Commission as a contract market or
derivatives transaction execution facility for precious metals. See AmeriFirst Management, LLC,
No. 0:13-cv-61637-WPD (S.D. Fla. Sept. 17, 2013), slip op. at 7. The Respondents therefore
violated Section 4(a) of the Act.

D. Respondents Violated Section 4d(a)(1) of the Act

Section 4d(a)(1) of the Act makes it unlawful for any person to engage as a futures
commission merchant (âFCMâ), unless such person is registered with the Commission as an
FCM and such registration has not expired or been suspended or revoked. The Act defines FCM
to include, among other things, a corporation that is engaged in soliciting or accepting orders for
any agreement, contract, or transaction described in Section 2(c)(2)(D)() (retail commodity
transactions) and in or in connection with such acceptance of such orders, accepts money,
securities, or property (or extends credit in lieu thereof) to margin, guarantee, or secure any
trades or contracts that result or may result therefrom. 7 U.S.C. Â§ 1a(28)(A)(i)()(aa)(DD) and
(II), APAM acted as an FCM by soliciting and accepting customersâ orders for financed
precious metals transactions and, in connection with those transactions, accepting at least $1.6
million from those customers, including customers who were not ECPs or ECEs. As such,
APAM acted as an unregistered FCM. This conduct violated Section 4d(a)(1) of the Act.

EK. APAM Is Liable for the Violations of Its Agents

Under Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. Â§ 2(a)(1)(B) (2012), as well as Regulation
1.2, 17 C.F.R. Â§ 1.2 (2013), a principal is strictly liable for the violations of its agents made
within the scope of the agentsâ employment. Rosenthal & Co. v. CFTC, 802 F.2d 963, 966 (7th
Cir. 1986). Kneller, along with APAM telemarketers, was an agent of APAM, and within the
course and scope of their employment they violated Section 4(a) of the Act. APAM is therefore
liable for these violations.

F, Kneller Is Liable for APAM?âs Violations as Its Controlling Person
Under Section 13(b) of the Act

Section 13(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C, Â§ 13c(b) (2012), imposes liability on a person who,
directly or indirectly, controls any person who has violated the Act or any rules, regulations, or
orders issued pursuant to the Act, if that controlling person did not act in good faith or knowingly
induced, directly or indirectly, the act or acts constituting the violation. See [In re First Nat'l
Trading Corp., [1992-1994 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) f 26,142 at 41,787
(CFTC Jul. 20, 1994), aff'd without opinion sub nom. Pick vy. CFTC, 99 F.3d 1139 (6th Cir,
1996),

 
Kneller was owner, president and chief executive officer of APAM, was the sole
signatory on APAMâs bank account, and was responsible for its day to day operations.
Therefore, Kneller had both general control over APAM and specific control over the conduct
underlying APAMâs violations, i.e., APAMâs offering to enter into, entering into, and confirming
the execution of retail financed precious metals transactions, and APAMâs conducting an office
and business in the United States for soliciting, accepting, and otherwise dealing in retail
financed precious metals transactions. See, e.g., R.J. Fitzgerald, 310 F.3d at 1334 (recognizing
an individual who âexercised the ultimate choice-making power within the firm regarding its
business decisionsâ as a controlling person), Jn re Spiegel, [1987-1990 Transfer Binder] Comm.
Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) 24,103 at 34,767 (CFTC Jan. 12, 1988) (evidence that a respondent is an
officer, founder, principal, or the authorized signatory on the companyâs bank accounts indicates
the power to control a company). He also was aware that APAM was not registered and allowed
the business to continue.

Since Kneller committed and knowingly induced, directly or indirectly, the violations of
the Act by APAM, and did not act in good faith, he is liable for those violations of the Act and
Regulations pursuant to Section 13(b) of the Act.

The Respondents shall, jointly and severally, pay restitution in the amount of four
hundred seventy-eight thousand four hundred and seventy-four dollars ($478,474) within

Order and shall be determined by using the Treasury Bill rate prevailing on the date of

The Respondents shall make their payments of the Restitution Obligation under this
Order to NFA, the Monitor appointed in this matter. The Respondents shall make their
payments of the Restitution Obligation under this Order in the name of the

CFTC Orders Florida Resident Alan M. Kneller and His Company American Portfolio Asset
Management, Inc. to Pay Restitution and a Civil Monetary Penalty Totaling More than
$578,000 in Precious Metals Enforcement Action

Order Also Permanently Bars Respondents from Trading on CFTC-
Regulated Markets

Washington, DC â The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today filed an Order instituting
proceedings and settling charges against Respondents American Portfolio Asset Management, Inc. (APAM), and its
owner, Alan M. Kneller, both of Boca Raton, Florida. The CFTC Order charged Kneller and APAM with illegally offering
off-exchange financed transactions in precious metals to retail customers and failing to register with the CFTC as a
Futures Commission Merchant (FCM), as required.

The CFTC Order requires the Respondents jointly to pay restitution of $478,474 to their customers and a $100,000 civil
monetary penalty. The Order also requires the Respondents to cease and desist from further violations of the Commodity
Exchange Act, as charged, and prohibits them from trading on or pursuant to the rules of any registered entity.

The Illegal Transactions

Specifically, the CFTC Order finds that, from at least August 2011 through at least February 2013, the Respondents
solicited retail customers to buy and sell physical precious metals, such as gold and silver, in off-exchange, leveraged
transactions. According to the Order, customers paid a percentage of the purchase price for the metals and received
financing for the remainder of the purchase price, while paying commissions and fees on the transactions.

The CFTC Order states that financed, off-exchange transactions with retail customers have been illegal since July 16,
2011, when certain amendments of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 became
effective. As explained in the Order, financed transactions in commodities with retail customers like those engaged in by
Respondents must be executed on, or subject to, the rules of a board of trade that has been designated by the CFTC as a
contract market. Since Respondentsâ transactions were done off-exchange, with customers who were not eligible contract
participants or eligible commercial entities, they were illegal, the Order finds.

Failure to Register

The Order also states that it is unlawful for any person to act as an FCM, unless such person is registered with the CFTC
as an FCM and such registration has not expired or been suspended or revoked. APAM acted as an FCM by soliciting and
accepting customersâ orders for financed precious metals transactions and, in connection with those transactions,
accepting funds from those customers, including customers who were not eligible contract participants or eligible
commercial entities. As such, APAM acted as an unregistered FCM.

The CFTC cautions victims that restitution orders may not result in the recovery of money lost because the wrongdoers
may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers and to
ensure the wrongdoers are held accountable.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this matter are Karin N. Roth, Christopher Giglio, Douglas K.
Yatter, Lenel Hickson, Jr., and Manal M. Sultan.
